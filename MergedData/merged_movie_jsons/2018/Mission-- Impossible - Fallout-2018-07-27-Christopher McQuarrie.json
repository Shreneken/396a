            "review_title": "Technically and emotionally, Mission: Impossible: Fallout is the first major representative of action genre",
            "content": "It was from Mission: Impossible 3 (2006) that the franchise began to strike a balance between pace (faster than the first) and history (more elaborate than the previous one). In addition, JJ Abrams' debut as a director on the big screen introduced two important secondary characters, Julia (Michelle Monaghan) and Benji (Simon Pegg) - he established himself as the second most frequent supporting actor, second only to Luther (Ving Rhames), the single that appears in all the films together with Ethan. After the well-executed Ghost Protocol (2011), commanded by Brad Bird, the series gained a very interesting touch with the arrival of Christopher McQuarrie. As a screenwriter, he smartly took advantage of the mention of the Union at the end of the previous film to develop the Rogue Nation plot (2015), which brought Ethan, Luther and Benji chasing this terrorist organization, headed by Solomon Lane (Sean Harris), and at the same time, dealing with the risk of dissolution of the IMF as a result of the Ghost Protocol events - this created a hitherto unprecedented sense of continuity between the two films.The title's Fallout has several meanings - among them 'Side Effect', 'Rest' and 'Radioactive Dust'. In the film we have a literal and figurative meaning at the same time. There is a real threat of nuclear bomb and also the consequences of the choices that our protagonist Ethan Hunt made in his life, when the past comes back to haunt him, what remains of all his good deeds. This sixth part of the franchise continues several of the situations established in the previous work, Rogue nation, also directed by Christopher McQuarrie. In addition, the filmmaker takes up other previous ideas, exploring the twists that marked the first and third films, as well as the notion of loyalty to the team members, seen in the third and fourth, and the protection of loved ones, as in the second and in the bedroom. This not only creates thematic unity in the series but also helps to reinforce the protagonist's personality.Even repeating starting points previously seen, such as the rescue of nuclear weapons, the dismantling of secret associations and the search for double agents, there is a new topic to be discussed in the \"Fallout\". Something that was always present in Hunt's story, but that had never been addressed literally: his own humanity. This is the greatest homage that the film pays to the complete saga. After all, how to forget how many times the agent has already put his life, and that of all humanity, in danger to save those he loves. That relay from before, with forgettable characters replacing forgettable characters, no longer exists. Exceptional control by the filmmaker in what he wants for the franchise, in the second film under his command, is exactly what allows Mission: Impossible - Fallout to be an apex of the genre.\nMcQuarrie tells a story, in the usual conspiratorial molds, being told under a superficial layer. Far from being simplistic, but also far from extreme complexity or wit, what is being told is not very impressive. The motivations for the antagonists follow, in short, the classic recipe, but the central issue is not in the functional story, however, in the exciting narrative, which drives events to another dimension and allows the Fallout to be the great achievement of the genre in which finds. Therefore, it is not an exaggeration to characterize the feature film as one of the most energetic American action productions of recent years. By also having control over the script, McQuarrie invents and reinvents the antics related to the iconic twists, filling his project with countless of them, but never too much forcing them. Each turnaround is an impulse, which multiplies our interest and involvement in the film. Cinema is about action, not wanting to be anything more, with clever metaphors or some biblical allegory to show how intellectual McQuarrie is. The impossible happens on the scene, however, we do not discredit what we see, because the feature film, unlike others of the genre, has self-awareness of what it is, thus allowing the suspension of disbelief to be combined with entertainment that only values McQuarrie's work.The screenwriter and director reconstructed the genre cinema with Mission: Impossible - Fallout: the action received more dramatic layers (without plummeting to melodramas or clich\u00e9s); Ethan Hunt was decentralized from the plot despite obviously being the protagonist; women received an importance ranging from the femme fatalle of Vanessa Kirby with her White Widow to the development of the fantastic Ilsa Faust (Rebecca Ferguson) - who repeats her participation; the exaggerated comic relief gave way to a more restrained Benji Dunn (Simon Pegg) and without losing his personality; Ving Rhames with his Luther Stickell received much more importance (as it might have happened some time ago); and the villain went from being episodic and one-dimensional to being of rare complexity in action films - so rare that the last one that reached the depth of Solomon Lane (the spectacular Sean Harris) must have been Alan Rickman's Hans Gruber in the first Die Hard, 1988 (30 years ago).McQuarrie, likewise, surrenders to the film with such competence that the action scenes directed by John Woo in 2000 are instantly forgotten. That choreographed movement by Woo gives space to McQuarrie's restless camera, which, even though unstoppable, manages to be very well understood. This same camera, positioned for several counter-plunges (below eye level and facing upwards), magnifies the character of Henry Cavill (the intimidating of so big and strong August Walker) and strengthens the excellent performance of the current Superman. Here, more than ever, we see scenes of visceral struggles, of high physical vigor, impact and realism - the bathroom scene and the final fight on the precipice are the greatest examples - and they do not show that they are choreographed.The action is practically uninterrupted and if, in the end, the reminder is that the film started out slow and then started, it is a problem of perspective. This chapter extrapolates and raises to the maximum everything that has been shown so far. Christopher McQuarie's direction knows how to create magnificent action scenes mixed with tension and a sense of urgency, making the audience emotional, tense, twist and be impressed over the two and twenty hours of footage. Again we have everything and a little more than expected from the series, which improves and challenges itself more and more throughout the franchise. We have scenes of jumping from a plane in the air in a phenomenal sequence plane, chases at extremely high speed involving motorcycles, cars and trucks through the streets of Paris, the whole passage in London (highlighting the rush of Hunt and the jumps between buildings in the hunt for the villain of the production) and, obviously, the scenes in Kashmir that make up the best last act of recent cinema times, combining tension with the rest of the IMF group trying to defuse two nuclear bombs while Hunt stars in a helicopter chase that culminates in a visceral struggle on the edge of a precipice. The film abuses the practical effects and it is difficult to differentiate what has CGI from the real. Beautiful technical work.The most impressive thing is to see how Cruise still avoids the use of stunts in most scenes. Not exactly because of the difficulty of these, which are really difficult without any further obstacles, but because of their age. In one scene, the actor even broke his ankle and went uncut, limping, but firmly on his Ethan's body (and delayed filming later, of course). Cruise is undoubtedly an actor who is never limited to an \"autopilot\". Fly helicopters - and hang from them! -, driving cars at high speed, jumping over buildings and running as if there was no tomorrow, all done in the most realistic way possible, even if we are facing a character who practices impossible acts are some of his most notable feats. This without mentioning the most dramatic part that the actor knows how to conduct in full.Alec Baldwin, Simon Pegg and Ving Rhames return and fit the plot very well. Other prominent returns are that of Rebecca Ferguson who returns to deepen his personal dilemmas and his relationship with Hunt, both actors have an enviable chemistry and Sean Harris who returns to give life to the villain of the previous feature, here he keeps talking little, but his ambitions are much clearer and he serves as a \"ladder\" for the real antagonist of the feature. In the new additions the one who steals the show is Henry Cavill in the role of a government agent who is tasked with watching and caring for Hunt. The actor has an enviable physique and if he is not impressed by his performance, he is not to be desired in terms of beating and other action scenes in the feature.With an accelerated and uninterrupted soundtrack composed by Lorne Balfe, referring almost directly to Hans Zimmer, it makes the Fallout clearly result in a bigger Mission: Impossible. The soundtrack that anguishes and carries us on our shoulders throughout the projection, combined with an unbelievable sound design, making us feel every punch delivered and received by Hunt, \"Mission: Impossible - Fallout\" is the best film of all the franchise. Technically and emotionally. Mission: Impossible - Fallout wins in a historic process. In times when genre cinema has been gaining more and more space (see the horror), the action gains its first major representative.",

            "content": "\"Mission: Impossible - Fallout\" is the sixth entry of the \"Mission: Impossible\" series and the best entry thus far. \"Fallout\" is a masterpiece. It continues the tradition of the series, where it gets better with each film. This one improves on the older films in every aspect. It has pretty much everything: the action, the stunts, the visuals, the twists. It's a thrilling experience where the viewer is kept on their toes at all times.Starting with the action, it is clean, hard-hitting, and it is both directed superbly and brilliantly performed by the actors. This is true when it comes to both the fight scenes and the vehicle scenes. They drive cars, motorcycles, and everything in between throughout the film and it all looks great.The action wouldn't have been as good without its great stunts. I won't ramble on about Tom Cruise for too long but once again, he puts on a remarkable performance. A lot of the stunts are mind-blowing and I have no clue how the man does it, especially now being in his late 50s. Some of these stunts are impossible to describe with words. There is a great amount of documentation of these stunts and they are a must-watch to fully appreciate the film. Cruise risks his life multiple times for the sake of the audience's entertainment and he deserves recognition for it.The visuals are great too, some of the shots in this film were absolutely awe-inspiring. Not only in the way they capture Cruise's stunts but also in the pure beauty of some of the shots. There are plenty that could be named in this review but it is best to watch the film for yourself and see it with your own eyes.The story in \"Fallout\" is great too. The villain is great for starters and the intricate story is enthralling to watch unfold. It sure is complicated, but pay attention and it isn't that hard to follow. There are plenty of great twists in this film and they never feel out of place. The viewer is constantly kept guessing and wondering where the story will go next.If there is something to be thrown at the film it might be either that the film is a bit unrealistic at times or that they repeat some of the old tricks from the older movies. The former is more justified than the latter. Some of the action is a bit over-the-top and unrealistic. It is purely up to personal taste to decide whether that is a negative or not. When it comes to some of the old tricks, they do kind of repeat some elements from the older films, but not to the detriment of the experience. Maybe you'll realize after something happens that you recognize it, but you can never easily see it coming and it is generally done very well.In summary, \"Mission: Impossible - Fallout\" is a great film. This film is for the viewer looking for great action, incredible stunts, and stunning visuals. It is an absolutely incredible action movie from start to finish.",

The movie is high on action and stunts with some great car and bike chases.It is advisable for you to watch M:I-5 in order to understand what is happening in the movie as both the movies are somewhat inter related.The plot of the movie might not be fresh as we have seen similar plots in the franchise but credit should be given to the makers for it's execution as with some unexpected twists the movie will keep you glued to the screens till the end. The acting is one of the strongest factor of the movie apart from it's stunts and action.Cinematography and it's powerful visuals is the another strong aspect and also the movie is shot in some of the very beautiful locations and is been captured nicely.Climax of the movie is like typical Mission: Impossible climax and will give you goosebumps. The stunts in the climax should be appreciated.Overall in my opinion this is the best movie of the franchise and a must watch.",

Arms dealer John Lark and a group of terrorists, known as the Apostles conspire to use three plutonium cores for a simultaneous nuclear attack on the Vatican, Jerusalem, and Mecca. When the weapons go missing, Ethan and his crew find themselves in a desperate race against time to prevent them from falling into the wrong hands.The action scenes were perfectly executed by Tom Cruise, which gets your adrenaline pumping instantaneously. His stunts, jumps, and plans along with the tiny plot twists make the movie very fun to watch.This witty action movie instills all sorts of emotions in you. It includes light comedy which is always showcased in the right time and place; however, it is also pretty emotional in some parts.The plot itself is very rich and entertaining, and the flow of events is so smooth. This film makes you theorize the entire time, which keeps you hooked throughout the whole thing.In my opinion, the only problem with the movie is that it is all built on one silly mistake that Ethan Hunt does at the beginning of the film. Nevertheless, other than that, the movie is a must-watch!Score: 9/10.",

MISSION IMPOSSIBLE - FALLOUT showcases a perfect blend of breathtaking action, eye-catching locations and exhilarating cinematography combined with suspenseful thrills. Even though the summer's come to an end, the film made me feel it just started!I don't think just one viewing is going to satisfy me. Halfway through the film and I was thinking of a second watch. IMAX viewing totally justified.When I watched the previous 3 MI movies back-to-back yesterday, I had no idea I'd be in a complete treat today! I knew FALLOUT would be great, but it just surprised and surpassed all my expectations!I can talk about this movie all day. I love action movies and this is easily one of the best ones I've seen this year. Apart from entertainment, it also provides lessons on how to make action movies, efficiently. It couldn't have been any better than this. I would easily label this as my finest IMAX experience of an action blockbuster, ever.In one word, MISSION IMPOSSIBLE - FALLOUT is PERFECT.

            "content": "As we all know, this is the sixth instalment of the franchise. Supposedly by this time, the series already started long to drag their wear and tear tires here and about, so within so without, sucking every preposterous and ridiculous ideas they can think of. However, Mission Impossible franchise has been one of the few to deny that statement, as the impossible becomes possible, as it suggests that statement is merely a myth, as the ideas never entirely run out, as the stunts are afresh and eye-catching but can this new instalment keep up with the others (putting aside the second one as if it never happens because the majority of us can agree it's the worst) or will it have a serious fallout?One thing to talk about is the plot. It is superficially heavy this time, in fact the heaviest out of all the series. Plus, it is intertwined and ultra-complicated for a summer Hollywood movie that you will be exhausted after the 147 mins ride. What makes this successful is that it has that Oscar-worthy vibe and it solves the puzzles very neatly towards the end despite some revelations might come off as predictable. And before I forget to mention, this movie has a lot of deep connections with Rogue Nation (the 5th instalment). Watch the previous instalment before stepping into this new mission or you will hardly relate with the characters. And if you've had the time, revise the 3rd one too.Now, you must promptly be wondering, how about the stunts? Let me get to this part. THE... STUNTS... ARE... REAL! Every time you go in watching this best ongoing franchise in the world, you should bear in mind that CGI is a non-existent element. And the stunts are performed by Tom Cruise himself. The daring set pieces are well choreographed and acted in a way that looks real and genuine that puts most of this year's other action blockbuster movies to shame. The BATHROOM scene... will leave you in total shock. The PARIS scene... will make you gasp due to many unexpected moments... The ROOFTOP scene... will make you wonder which one that got Tom Cruise injured... The KASHMIR scene... will make your heart jitters and probably, pees in your pants because... THE STUNTS ARE ALL REAL!Acting is well done, of course. Henry Cavill savors his swashbuckler swagness, Simon Pegg brings less comedy to the table but executes a more matured lad, Rebecca Ferguson has improved a lot since her debut in Rogue Nation, and she has lost a lot of weight that perfectly suits her role, Michelle Monaghan makes us miss her character so much and eventually, fall in love with her and Tom Cruise is anything good you can possible talk about. He is a legend!What I like is it plays a bit different this time in which there is less over-the-top artificial techs and more to realistic stunts that put the gadgets to rest this time. This is a classified mission where nothing is impossible in reality but it is impossible to commit because of how dangerous and menacing there are. They opt on breathtaking locations as they fill with richness and intensity making the movie charges with a load of energy that transmits to the audience who becomes alive and fully realizes that this is the exact location without any usage of CGI.When the action scenes come in especially the Paris scene, the sound effect is top-notch; you can hear those tiny details of engineered sound system waving in the cinema hall, sucking the audience as if we are in the action movie ourselves.What I dislike is the repetitive dialogues by the characters, it is semi-cool and semi-irritating because they keep saying the same phrases. It comes off as irritating but why is it cool is because sometimes, it uses the third-act solution technique in creating a storyline... and humor apparently.Another thing I despise is the scene when the theme song emerges on the big screen. Don't get me wrong... I love and salute the theme song. However, I hate it when it shows glimpses of scenes and stunts that about to happen afterwards followed by its almost-constructed chronological order. In my opinion, that is a big spoiler!And I dislike that they fail to tell Jeremy Renner's character whereabouts after Rogue Nation (as far as I can remember).Truth to be told, I wasn't a huge fan of the Mission Impossible series until... three months before this movie came out. I felt a whole energy down my spine and knew this is going to be a good one. Bloody hell! How wrong was I! It isn't just good, it is state-of-the-art masterpiece action blockbuster film.So if I'm going to rank all the six impossible-made films, it would be:\n(From Best to Worst)6, 4, 3, 5, 1 and 2.Is there any hope for this franchise to survive in Hollywood? VERY POSSIBLE!\nIs there any story left that this franchise can get hold onto for the next instalment? POSSIBLE!\nIs there any chance you might doze off during the movie at any condition? IMPOSSIBLE!\nIs there any chance left that the stunts can get any better than Fallout? VERY IMPOSSIBLE!Your mission... should you choose to accept it is to see Mission Impossible: Fallout in theaters!Overall: 90/100This message will self-destruct in 5 seconds...",

The IMF screws up and three plutonium cores come into The Apostles hands. Recovering them might be tricky, especially as they are forced to work with an unsubtle CIA enforcer.This is a direct sequel to the previous film, with weasel-faced, nasal-voiced Sean Harris reprising the brilliant villain Solomon Lane. Rebecca Ferguson features again as compromised MI5 agent Ilsa, Ving Rhames , Alex Baldwin and Simon Pegg are IMF support, and Michelle Monaghan is there to be in jeopardy. Angela Bassett and Henry Cavill represent the CIA (Cavill's facial hair necessitating expensive CGI removal in Justic League reshoots), and Vanessa Kirby plays a pleasingly questionable mercenary intermediary.The story is involved - not difficult to understand, but a bit on the serpentine side. But it does provide a vehicle for some, as always, excellent action sequences. A motorcycle chase through Paris and a rooftop chase in London are stunningly choregraphed and photographed, but I felt that the climactic action sequence was a bit overbaked. And they led me up the garden path briefly, but no.You know whether you like this sort of movie or not. And, if you do, you're in for a treat with this one.",

            "content": "'Mission: Impossible - Fallout' burst onto the scene this weekend, rejuvenating what had been a mostly baron summer of action-blockbusters. Sure, we had 'Equalizer 2' and 'Skyscraper,' but those were both meh. Thankfully, this film is far better than meh. Actually, it's excellent. Its excellence comes from a commitment to the craft. Normally, three months of intensive training are required for someone to qualify for a helicopter pilot's license. Tom Cruise, in preparation for this film, did it in half that time. How? By training 16 hours a day, seven days a week. He did all this for one action sequence. That's the level of commitment to the craft that went into this movie. Each grand set piece (all of which are glorious) fills the frame just right. Very little CGI is used, which makes everything look real because it is real. We aren't watching a contrived creation of what is supposed to look like Tom Cruise zipping through town on a motorcycle-he's actually zipping through town on a motorcycle. And that helicopter pilot training? That paid off in a big way. It delivered what is one of the best, most intense action sequences in years. Each scene flows smoothly into the next, rarely pausing to catch its breath. It brings to mind memories of 'Mad Max: Fury Road,' which featured a similarly breakneck pace and continuous propulsion. Fallout's action doesn't quite reach that level, but the feel is certainly similar. I've waited this long to mention the plot because I hardly considered it essential, which might sound weird or as though it's a detriment (it's not). There is a lot to know and also very little know. Early scenes feature some rather extensive exposition. The density and length of these conversations may cause some viewers' minds to wander-that's okay. While the dialogue is crisp and the details are helpful for better understanding the plot, all viewers really need to understand is that a group of terrorists called The Apostles want to wreak havoc, and it's Ethan Hunt's mission to stop them. Basically, he and his team need to save the world. There's nothing wrong with action taking center stage over the story in this case. After all, this is an action movie. The minute reasons why something is happening become less important when what is happening is so masterfully executed and thrilling to watch. The camera whirls majestically around each chase sequence, and the fight scenes pop off the screen. They're brutal, well-shot and coherent, which is not always the case with big budget action films. The violence feels real, as do the consequences. I know jaw-dropping is a bit of a clich\u00e9 description to use, but these fight scenes (and a few additional action sequences) literally made my jaw drop. And of course, in between the fights, we receive a hefty dose of Tom Cruise running really fast. He's one of the all-time best movie runners. Tremendous intensity. Beautiful form. Cruise is exceptional. This franchise would crumble without him. Ving Rhames, who has been at Cruise's side for all six 'M:I' films, is a steadying presence once again. Simon Pegg provides his usual comic relief, and Henry Cavill steps in as a younger, stronger super-spy, to remind us that Cruise can't do this forever. Overall, this is an exceptionally satisfying movie-going experience. It's one of the best films of the year and one that will stick with you well after leaving the theater.",

            "content": "Fallout feels like a direct sequel to Rogue Nation, even though it doesn't take place immediately after in the timeline (based on some dialogue I believe it to be two years later). But a lot of things remained consistent: we finally kept a director around (I'll get to that later) and many of the characters have returned, including one Solomon Lane (played by Sean Harris) with more villainy than ever before. In the past, we would cruise through team members such as Maggie Q, Jonathan Rhys Meyers, Paula Patton, and heck even Jeremy Renner who was not in this flick... but we have grown into others like Ving Rhames (whose character wasn't just there to look cool and throw in some one-liners, but rather to shed some actual emotional weight), Simon Pegg (who has finally earned my respect \"in the field\" where I feel he now officially belongs), flashes of Michelle Monaghan (the Jules factor!) and newcomers Alec Baldwin (underused again) and Rebecca Ferguson (dayum is all I have to say). Yes, they threw in some new characters in this film... I'd say one too many for me to keep track of... but they didn't interfere too much with the chemistry already in place with the other actors/actresses surrounding Tom Cruise and the bigger picture. I'm a bit iffy on Henry Cavill's character still, as he felt a bit out of place from the franchise we've been accustomed to, but he did work in this film as did his mustache. Even still, I think this movie demands a re-watch on my end to understand all of the character motivations again, particularly three of them. All told it does feel like a sequel to RN in the sense that you should not see this one if you don't see that one. I think it is enough of a companion to make 3-6 part of a larger something when all watched together, even though 4 is only loosely connected at this point from a story perspective. In terms of feel however, it is not like any of the other M:I films before it. Instead of going for sleek and stylish, they chose raw and gritty in more ways than one. It really had its dark and serious moments, even played by the score through the opening credits (which I had to close my eyes for because they tend to spoil movie moments lol) demonstrating it would carry more epic impact than normal. Sometimes it delivered on that, and other times I think its reach exceeded its grasp, but ultimately you would feel it. It still had light humor time-to-time, but this was not a light-toned film in the slightest. I don't know if \"grounded\" is the right way to describe the film's attitude (because any time it is literally off the ground it is quite ridiculous as far as action films like to go!), but any time that it is on the ground everything is pretty simple. This film isn't built around stealth and technology; in fact, outside of masks and GPS-tracking (and some thing reading off a mission), I honestly couldn't name a single piece of technology that was more advanced than that in this entire film (EDIT: I thought of one more thing but it really won't wow you, and you probably won't even think of what I'm talking about after seeing it). Outside of some of the camera work, it definitely had a throwback feel to it, pulling the reins a lot but not in a forced way. This one just didn't call for a lot of futuristic technology.The action this time around really was all about chases, gunplay and hand combat. I mean if you like hand combat, then you'll really have fun with 2-3 particular scenes in this movie. This is all good and great for an action movie, but good enough for Mission: Impossible? Because of the characters involved, YES. Outside of one of the beginning set-pieces, every action scene in this movie is heavily built up and driven by the story around it, and felt like the story's impact of the moment was always bigger than the stunts being pulled off. This is a good thing, but that also means it's not all surface-level entertainment. You could pop in your Blu-ray of any of the previous three M:I films and watch an action sequence and just go: \"Hell yeah.\" In this film, each moment is earned a little more as the story progresses, and they are very character-focused moments. I can't say it really compares to the other films in terms of action, but it worked. At one point I think it got a hair too ridiculous, but I was on board because of the situation at hand. This doesn't really have the summer blockbuster tag that the last two felt like they did, though. I can see some high schoolers not understand the progression of this franchise and walk out going: \"That was stupid and boring.\" Go watch Transformers, little ones.Now it's time to sing some serious praises for two individuals. The first one is writer/director Christopher McQuarrie. Given the state of this franchise, they found the right person to steer the ship. Even in the middle of this 2.5-hour-long film when the action feels a bit bogged down and mundane from something you'd expect out of M:I, McQuarrie does enough for it to still feel different. Many scenes are shot so practically, the music is always original, tongue-in-cheek moments are injected without taking you out of the scenes, and you're always exploring the space around you so that nothing is ever too stationary. There is one action setting that didn't work for me at all and I honestly don't know what was going on, but it dynamically moved away from there fast enough and continued on to the next immediate action moment that all was forgiven and I was caught up to speed again. He understands the characters so you're not left with thinking they're making irrational decisions, and he understands how to showcase his stars so they can give him all that they have to offer. He captures it in a nice wide frame and only cuts when he has to. Sometimes he mutes the score for the sound effects, and there is this one really awesome moment where he drowns the sound effects from the score and it works so perfectly. If there is another film, I expect him to stay a part of the team.The next person is Tom Cruise. Good. Lord. This guy is the reason we watch these movies. Talk about a guy giving it his all. Stunts in previous films may have had the panache that sells you watching the trailer, but I can tell you first-hand that nothing is as demanding as what he went through doing some of his stunts this time around. This guy doesn't age! When I say that, I mean he literally looks younger in this film than he did in Rogue Nation or Ghost Protocol! This dude shows you what it means to sprint, and his abilities handling a weapon, riding a motorcycle, now doing things off the ground (which means more than one thing really), and everything else just makes the action that much more convincing. You don't have to have CGI, green screen, stunt doubles, or quick-cuts to try and convince you otherwise (I'm looking at you, Taken 3). It's only unfortunately that you're actually taken out for a moment only to sit back and say: \"Holy ****, Tom Cruise is actually doing that in front of our eyes.\" Kudos to what he does, and apparently it is worth every penny of everybody watching it as well. He will break bones for us to make this happen, and it really is a delight. He is an ageless wonder, and I can't wait to see what he is willing to do for us next! I just hope he makes it out the other side each time.I'll admit I was a little shook with how different this film was than the others, but it didn't make it any worse... just different. Connection-wise it feels more like a M:I sequel than any other one, but tone-wise it couldn't feel more separate. I have to wrap my head around some of the plot points and character motivations I didn't quite grasp watching it, but if I am going to grade it on M:I standards I can't in all good faith put it above 3 or 5. That doesn't mean it is a worse film, though. It was a great film, and by all technical merits it hit too many right notes, and I believe more so than any of the ones before it. Just a little bit of unevenness, but I like that characters were the focus and that they dug deep into what Rogue Nation gave us instead of just making something another wacky episode in the wide world of Ethan Hunt & crew. It was not as flashy and full of blockbuster moments as the other films were save a couple of items here and there, but I think if you are a fan of this franchise you would be way hard-pressed to find too many downfalls in the final result. Leaving the theater I award it a strong eight mustaches out of ten, and sandwiching it around the middle. If this is on the merits of being a film and and of itself, I would place it above Ghost Protocol easily and it could potentially top 3 and 5 for some. If judged against films for being in the Mission: Impossible franchise, GP may sneak above it by a hair. But because of the strong connection to Rogue Nation leading to some consistency for once, I'll currently place my ranking at:3\n5\n6\n4\n1\n2I think this is a movie that will get better the more you re-watch it, whereas the other films really peak their excellence the first time through because there isn't much past surface-level. I can't wait to see this one again.- - - - - - - - - - - - - -P.S. I don't know where else to fit this, so I'll just place it at the end. There was this recurring line in the film that characters would say, along the ilk of: \"I'll figure it out.\" It was always in response to a character asking how they'll approach something next. I don't know if this was a gaff in the screenplay or a wink at the audience in some way---maybe as a response to the previous movie having two different characters literally anticipate every outcome of the film's entirety since the planning stages---and now showing in this film that they have to improvise scenarios reactionarily to something that was unforeseen. I don't know what it was, but it felt like it was said a bit too much. I'd really like to hear McQuarrie bring that up in an audio commentary.",

I also should know that in the first week on screens it's mostly the hardcore fans running to see the film and writing viewer comments on IMDB, so the current stellar grade does not really mean that 'Mission: Impossible - Fallout' (8.5 right now) is a better film than 'Citizen Kane' (8.4). I took the risk of being among the early viewers and I was punished. The quality level of the installments of the M:I series is on a decreasing curve, and this is continuing with this latest issue in the series. My opinion, of course.I am never judging an action movie with the same criteria as I am judging a drama, a comedy, or an art film. Yet, there are some elements that I look for in any film - a story that has logic and catches my interest, and characters that I care about. None of them is present in this film co-written and directed by Christopher McQuarrie whom Tom Cruise trusted with writing and directing some of his latest movies. The story of the rogue terrorists threatening to blow up the planet or at least half of it is placed as many of the latest movies in the genre in an aseptic and non-politic environment with non-identifiable bad guys, so that nobody is bothered and the film can be sold in as many markets as possible. The heroes destroy half of Paris and a quarter of London killing scores of policemen and innocent by-standers with no consequences. The main hero has a couple of Ethan-girls to care about and one more who seems to care for him, but the characters seem to be frozen or maybe wearing some of those rubber masks that the heroes are experts in.Yes, there are good and well paced and choreographed action scenes, but their gathering of coincidences makes them non-credible. The 3D capabilities are well used, but there is nothing that we haven't seen yet. Actually this M:I6 looks more like a 3D James Bond film, without the charm of Bond. There is a change of guard in managing Ethan Hunts activities, and Angela Bassett seems to replace Alec Baldwin who probably had enough and decided to jump wagon. Frankly speaking, I am not sure that I want to see M:I7 after this disappointing M:I6. Tom Cruise is 56 years now, and cannot pretend being 35 or 40 years old forever. He seems to enjoy the narcissistic exercises that the movies he plays in for the last ten years, but how long can these last. If I am not mistaken his last non-action role was in Valkyrie in 2008. On the other side, if he has fun and viewers have fun watching him, who am I to tell him what to do? I can only decide to not watch his next movies.",

This is the 6th film in the franchise born (not Bourne) from the classic TV series (1966-73) created by Bruce Geller (credited in each film). Writer/director Christopher McQuarrie returns for this companion piece to his 2015 MISSION: IMPOSSIBLE ROGUE NATION, as of course does mega-star Tom Cruise as the aforementioned Ethan Hunt.Hunt's team of Benji (Simon Pegg) and Luther (Ving Rhames) returns, as does really really bad guy Solomon Lane (a glowering Sean Hayes), and MI6 agent Ilsa (Rebecca Ferguson). New to the scene is Agent August Walker (Henry Cavill, MAN OF STEEL), a hulking hunk of a man who doesn't share Ethan's belief in brainy strategy. Speaking of strategy, I was a bit tricky in inviting a friend to the screening who is in the midst of a years long boycott of Alec Baldwin movies. Although I felt a fleeting twinge of guilt, I believe the payoff was such that it lessened the impact of deception. Also appearing are Angela Bassett as a CIA toughie, Michelle Monaghan, Wes Bentley, and Vanessa Kirby (\"The Crown\") as White Widow.Most fans of this franchise have likely accepted that the stories are overly intricate - this one is unnecessarily jumbled - and they just enjoy the clamorous ride to an ending that typically has something to do with a bomb and saving the world. It's the action and stunts that drive ticket sales, and this one has the most extreme and over-the-top action sequences we've seen yet. Even though there is a familiarity to some, the stunts are still quite impressive; and yes, Mr. Cruise, now in his mid-50's, still performs his own stunts. This includes the leap between buildings where he actually suffered a broken ankle, shutting down production for a few months. The jump where he was injured is included in the film. And fear not, the Cruise Sprint is in full force on numerous occasions. Sadly, there is also a quick shot of a Ving Rhames jog - nothing but painful to watch.The film opens with a wedding day nightmare, but quickly moves to what the fans want - globetrotting, chase scenes, slick advanced technology and wacky stunts. The streets, bridges and landmarks of Paris are on full and spectacular display, while the chase scenes occur on foot, on motorcycle, in cars, and in helicopters. Crazy stunts include HALO jumping, rock climbing and dangling from an elevator shaft. There is a relentless brawl scene in a men's room where Hunt gets face planted into a porcelain sink and thrown through a wall ... and thanks to the magic of Hollywood, five minutes later, he has nary a scratch and looks as debonair as James Bond ever has. However, it's the final helicopter sequence through the mountains and cliffs of Kashmir that provide the signature moments of the film. Even with the nod to JURASSIC PARK, it's a breathtaking scene.Running nearly 2 \u00bd hours, this is the longest of the MISSION: IMPOSSIBLE films, and Ethan Hunt remains, along with Maverick in TOP GUN (sequel filming now), the best fit for Tom Cruise the actor and celebrity. Unfortunately the same can't be said for Henry Cavill. He's blessed with extraordinary genes - just not the thespian types. Filled with double and triple and quad crossings, whether you can follow the story or not, only the most stoic would claim you will find this anything less than an adrenaline rush ... should you decide to accept. Plus, it still features one of the best theme songs ever - especially powerful with today's phenomenal theatre sound systems. Thanks Lalo Schifrin.",

The whole John Lark plot line went through more changes in direction than any story had a right to have, and if you lost focus for even a second, the story might have flown right over your head. But on balance, the movie moves pretty quickly and I especially liked Simon Pegg in his role of Benji Dunn on the IMF team. I had him 'pegged' for a bit more humor but what the heck, he did a nice job with Ving Rhames backing up Tom Cruise's Ethan Hunt. I don't know if it was such a good idea for Ethan to run into Julia (Michelle Monaghan) in the middle of nowhere, that was stretching a coincidence too far to my mind but at least it helped him reconcile with his past.

This one seems even more awesome than those others especially since, for once, most of the cast from the previous one is in this one too! And the villain is played by one who's more known as a hero-Henry Cavill, who usually plays Superman currently. Tom Cruise does all his stunts and it obviously shows as there's no CGI at all when his action scenes appear. Me and my movie theatre-working friend really enjoyed this one so on that note, we both highly recommend Mission: Impossible - Fallout!",

There's an elaborate, and very threatening fight in a bathroom near the beginning. There's also an elaborate chase involving helicopters over the Himalayas as a climax, complicated by the fact that Cruise can't simply kill the villain since he has to take the detonator he's carrying. Also there is an interesting, somewhat over elaborate car chase in Paris for the middle which is OK if not brilliant.Once again, the plot involves Ethan Hunt being accused, or framed of involvement in a terrorist conspiracy, and the only way he can clear his name involves giving the terrorists what they want. This plan goes badly wrong, and Hunt has to find a way to solve it. I know variations of this happened in movies 1 and 4, and if I cared enough about the plots, it may have happened in 2, 3 and 5. At least this time the government officials who criticize Hunt are even more horribly compromised than usual.",

            "content": "The vast majority of movie franchises suffer from diminishing returns. This Tom Cruise-led action series has avoided that common downturn by turning in ridiculously ambitious, consistently fresh and eminently exhilarating thrill rides. The sixth M:I entry, Fallout also boasts some firsts: first time a director has returned, first time the story has been directly influenced by the previous instalment, and first time a femme fatale has come back to seduce/endanger our protagonist. A big part of the franchise's success has been the revolving door of directors at the helm, each bringing their own visual style and filmmaking priorities, so it's interesting to see how Christopher McQuarrie attacks his second impossible mission behind the camera. Not surprisingly, seeing as McQuarrie has always been a more blunt-force kind of action filmmaker, this sequel is arguably the most bruising and intense. Which is no small feat for a series that has prided itself on its physical demanding set pieces. There are no less than four sequences that are genuinely jaw-dropping in their execution, featuring crunching hand-to-hand combat, an invigorating car/motorbike pursuit, an adrenaline-pumping roof-top chase on foot, and a ballsy helicopters-playing-chicken sequence beginning with an unbelievable stunt. Love him or hate him offscreen, it's getting harder to argue that Cruise isn't one of the finest showmen working in Hollywood today. His dedication to performing some of the craziest stunts committed to celluloid is admirable and, quite simply, amazing considering his age. But it wouldn't be the hugely entertaining film it is if everyone wasn't firing on all cylinders; from the pitch-perfect supporting cast (Simon Pegg's comedic sidekick, Rebecca Ferguson's MI6 agent, Henry Cavill's undiplomatic CIA henchman) to the behind the scenes crew. In fact composer Lorne Balfe deserves special mention for his left-of-field score, the use of low, haunting orchestral tunes (including a fantastic rendition of the classic M:I theme) during select sequences is a masterstroke in imbuing the movie with a certain gravitas. With everyone at the top of their game, headlined by another fervent Cruise performance, Fallout is extremely high-calibre action cinema that will feature predominantly on end-of-year 'best' lists.",

He becomes the first director to come back for a sequel but that is because this film is a continuation of Mission Impossible - Rogue Nation that includes the return of the ruthless villain Solomon Lane (Sean Harris.)Ethan Hunt is searching for the shadowy John Lark and a terrorist group known as the Apostles who have stolen three plutonium cores right under the IMF team and plan to launch a nuclear attack. Joining Hunt is August Walker (Henry Cavill) a CIA assassin as the Head of the CIA does not trust the IMF team after losing the plutonium in the first place.The action ranges from Paris, Berlin, London and Kashmir. The script has double and triple crosses and even Walker mentions the constant use of face masks like it is Halloween. In fact even the audience is ahead of the characters in the film by now when it comes to face mask deceptions.If you watch this in the cinema this is a thrilling action packed film. However it is too long clocking in at 2 hours and 30 minutes. McQuarrie is a good screenwriter and has the nuts and bolts down of an action movie. He makes sly references to previous MI films (The character of Max from the first film) and even other Cruise movies (the word 'crystal' is used when one character asks if they have made themselves clear.)However as a director he is a bit vanilla. This is a franchise that started with Brian De Palma and John Woo, directors who would being style and visual flourishes to each installment. McQuarrie as a director lacks any signature moves apart from competency.Some of the action sequences reminded me of the Bond films, some of the locations were a little uninspiring. London is used again for the third time in the film franchise.I expect the future films in the franchise to have a shake up including members of the IMF team. I think Benji has run his course and Luther is a bit long in the tooth as well as bit too porky for these kind of films.",

            "content": "As much as this is Tom Cruise's franchise, the biggest reason to go see the new Mission Impossible movie is the stunts. McQuarrie, Cruise and the creative team found new ways to push the envelope even farther and it made for a thrilling trip to the theatre. I can't go into specific set pieces without spoiling things, but not only do they go as big as they can but they way they decided to film these scenes was just as impressive. If you consider that Cruise did many of the stunts himself, what they accomplished here becomes even more credible.Character development is rarely the focus of action movies. They made some interesting choices here and one of them was the inclusion of Julia Meade (Michelle Monaghan). I won't go deep enough to spoil her entire arc, the main purpose of her character is to humanize Ethan Hunt (Tom Cruise) a little. She hasn't been a featured character since Mission Impossible 3 but she's a fun character to bring back and her inclusion brings a new set of problems for Ethan. Another area of focus is the differing ways that Ethan Hunt and August Walker (Henry Cavill) take care of their jobs. Walker is a force of nature and rarely leaves anything but dead bodies when he exits a mission. Hunt cares about the individuals and the movie poses the question which is the more effective philosophy for a spy? It's not essential to the plot but I thought it was a nice touch.Tom Cruise is a controversial figure, but if you put that aside, there's a reason his movies continue to top the box office (can we all just forget The Mummy?). He's great again as Ethan Hunt, he's not Cruise's most layered character but between the action and his interactions with his team, he pulls it off. Simon Pegg is his typically charming self again and he even gets a chance to do some more regarding the stunts. To say that he nailed his role again isn't newsworthy. Rebecca Ferguson comes back and continues to shine as Ilsa, she's very smooth and capable as a spy but she has enough warmth to have great chemistry with the rest of the ensemble. Ving Rhames is solid again as Luther, he also has a couple of nice moments and is a central figure in the cast. Henry Cavill still isn't the most expressive actor and the trailers for the movie almost spoil where his character ends up going but he's a good fit here. He has a lot of physicality and I think he does his job capably. Sean Harris carries over his good work from Rogue Nation as Solomon Lane and I enjoyed Vanessa Kirby, Angela Bassett and Alec Baldwin in their supporting roles. I don't have much to criticize Fallout for, it's not a perfect movie but there aren't many glaring flaws. The end has a couple of moments where the laws of physics don't seem to matter but this is something that every action movie is guilty of. Its not always about whether everything is accurate to the smallest detail, its often about whether you can distract the audience or coax them to believe it when they know it isn't true. There isn't anything here so egregious that it ruined the movie for me. I would also say that the movie does take a little while to warmup. Previous entries in the franchise began with a big set piece but Fallout goes in a different direction. There is a good payoff though, so my advice is to have some patience and it will be rewarded.I was blown away by Fallout and while it doesn't re-invent the Mission Impossible wheel, it represents an almost flawless execution of the formula. This is a step up from Rogue Nation (which was a solid film as a standalone) and clears the high bar that this franchise has set for itself. The action and the stunts are jaw-dropping intense, there's some nice moments of comedy (mainly from Pegg and Rhames), the cast is excellent, the characters are developed further (as much as they can be in an action movie) and while there are moments that stretch plausibility, the rest of the movie is executed so well that I could easily look past it. If you're a fan of the franchise or just enjoy big action that will get your pulse racing, this is worth going out of your way to see. I'm happy this is doing well at the box office and I can't wait for the next installment.",

As I'm sure you all know the Mission Impossible franchise (this is the sixth entry) follows the antics of the IMF, a sort of private intelligence organization, which to the intelligence community seems like the EU army to NATO, using a Donald Trump like analogy. (The film interestingly stars Trump adversary Alec Baldwin).The film has great stunt work some of which are noticeably performed by star Tom Cruise himself. One particularly painful stunt landed Cruise with an injury that halted filming for a while. The stunt makes the final cut. The pain is there to see! However the action sequences have been seen before in other films, most noticeably the James Bond franchise.I lost count of the number of times I said to my wife who was also watching. I've seen this before in such and such or wait for the scuba divers to rescue the guy locked in a security vehicle which has been rammed into a river! I am trying not to make my liking of the Bond films effect my review but it is difficult at times! The story is a little complicated but the action keeps your attention span and director Christopher McQuarrie paces the film well.The film has a two and a half hour run time which passes very quickly. Spy film aficionados will also take note of the casting of Henry Cavill as CIA agent August Walker. Cavill was cast in spy film The Man From U.N.C.L.E. in 2015. Director Christopher McQuarrie directed the last Mission: Impossible entry 'Rogue Nation' back in 2015 so comes with experience. Talking of experience the crew are veterans or the next generation of Bond film veterans (here he goes again!). I thoroughly enjoyed the film despite my picky protestations above.",

I mean, yeah, the hype is real as a heart attack. I, as well as the audience, did find ourselves laughing at times at how preposterous it gets (and don't front, it does), but it was how you are on the cliche of the HOLY WTF roller coaster.It also doesn't act like the audience are *idiots* or at least gets smug about the ridiculous feats, which is the key difference between this and the Fast & Furious movies, as though McQuarrie and Cruise and everyone are in on it, but they're elbowing us in our seats as we watch like, \"hehe aint this great!

            "content": "**Warning: Spoilers Ahead**Writer-director Christopher McQuarrie returns to direct the next instalment of the Mission Impossible series; and he already did a great job with Rogue Nation and he's not showing any indication of running out of creative gas.Mission Impossible: Fallout was probably one of the most entertaining experiences I've had at the movies in a long time: the set pieces are phenomenal especially the Paris sequence, and the helicopter finale is great while also being entertaingly implausible, because who'd have thought that choppers could become bumper cars when they're crashed and about to fall off the edge of a cliff, all while Tom Cruise is trying to disarm the nukes from Henry Cavill, Superman himself.Fallout is great modern cinema: sure it's contrived in terms of the elaborate schemes in parts of the movie but it's well-done and amusing contrived as opposed to something like mockbuster films where clueless directors pad-out their films with awkward exposition. Mission Impossible: Fallout is clever in its use of the franchise's legacy and using the set-pieces to show how epic and implausible the scenarios can truly be in these movies. It doesn't matter though; their purpose is to entertain you and show that Ethan Hunt is willing to save anyone and everyone, like that French Police Woman he saves from some thugs. Showing Ethan do something selfless as that shows how great a guy he truly is, even if he proceeds to drive on the wrong side of the Parisian traffic.Fallout is an action movie that is easily one of 2018's best and it's sure to have a lasting impression on you long after you've seen it. It's pop-art that is self aware yet clever in how it subverts what you've come to expect from these kind of movies. 5/5 Stars.",

            "content": "Virtually ageless Tom Cruise is back as fearless Agent Ethan Hunt in \"Mission: Impossible-Fallout\". \"Fallout\" may be the best summer movie of 2018. I think Writer and Director Christopher McQuarrie's \"Mission: Impossible\" sequel is one of the best action movies of all-time. Tom performs all of his own stunts like skydiving out of a military cargo jet over Paris in the helmeted pressure suit. In fact production on \"Fallout\" halted when Tom broke his ankle leaping between buildings. Rob Hardy's breathtaking and pristine cinematography captures the adrenaline rush as Tom races on his motorcycle through cluttered traffic in Paris or when he soars his helicopter to catch his adversary's over the snow capped mountains of Kashmir. McQuarrie electrifies in the restroom fight scene as Tom and Henry Cavill's Agent Walker throw down with martial arts expert Liang Yang. Relentless punches, elbows, and kicks awe for several minutes. Christopher's \"Fallout\" is by far the best \"Mission: Impossible\", elevated in pulse pounding action accelerating throughout 2 hours and 30 minutes. Chris's story is nearly too convoluted in its betrayal. Yet, I was pleasantly surprised in its emotional gravitas, and Tom Cruise's authentic humanity. The good man is the Hero. In a signature scene, an innocent women police officer stops Ethan and his team's escape. While Ethan convinces the officer to let them pass, a villain mercilessly shoots her down. Enraged, Ethan shoots down all five men. Character can be fate. Ethan's dearest friend Luther, played by powerful quiet Ving Rhames, tells Ilsa, played by beautiful strong Rebecca Ferguson, that Ethan loved only one woman before her. That he let Julia, played by beautiful kind Michele Monaghan, go keeping her safe, so he could save the world. Luther says, \"He's a good man. If you care about Ethan, walk away...\" Ethan is the hero, who gave up the love of his life to save the world. That's the high price to pay, even for the noble cause. The Hero deserves better. Tom Cruise passionately enrolls in Ethan's tireless conviction to do what's right, and protect the innocent. Tom's unspoken sadness in Ethan too, resonates. As \"Fallout\" opens Ethan messes up his mission to recover three weapons grade plutonium cores, when he chooses to save the life of his friend. New IMF (Impossible Mission Force - I think) Lead Alan, played by solid Alec Baldwin, reminds Ethan of his tragic flaw: he chose \"one life over millions\". I'd say that's more honor and compassion. No longer trusting Ethan, CIA Head Erica, played by smart bold Angela Bassett, mandates that her best Agent Walker, played with humorlessly ironic strength by Henry Cavill, accompany him in the plutonium recovery. Ethan and Walker's mission leads to the mysterious anarchist Lane, played by eerie calm Sean Harris. Lane believes, \"The greater the suffering, the greater the peace.\" Ethan and Walker form reluctant alliance with notorious arms broker White Widow, played cleverly by beautiful cunning Vanessa Kirby. So Ethan once again accepts his mission to save the world from annihilation. Strangely, this time around is wondrously captivating. In Tom's authentic sense of Ethan's loss, we get the depth of what's at stake for him. Yes, Ethan valiantly risks his life to prevent the nuclear terrorist threat. But does he find peace at the end of his great suffering? Does he discover love again? Ethan is a good man. He deserves peace. He deserves love. Ethan is like all of us. \"Mission: Impossible- Fallout\" is spectacular thrills in one of the best ever action movies. What makes \"Fallout\" so satisfying is that we pull for the Hero to find peace, to find love.",

Tom Cruise has no lines - the only arch in his character is that he is sorry. He is sorry in English, in broken French, with painful facial expressions, grunt and sighs and so on.

I saw it in a VIP theatre and it looked like this thing was shot on a consumer 3D handycam. The storyline was predictable and overly simplistic. I don't demand a lot from an action movie, but Michelle Monaghan's reintroduction was confusing, unnecessary and appeared to be written in as an afterthought. And all this talk about them doing their own stunts for added authenticity. Well, I for one would like them to go back to using professional stunt persons. This whole do your own stunts thing came off an an ego driven attempt to impress other cast members, that fell flat. Very flat. Finally, the writing was absolutely terrible. I couldn't help but wonder through the entire predictable movie if Tom Cruise also wrote and directed this himself. It was that bad. When I see the ridiculously high ratings on IMDB it makes me think that writing fake positive reviews is now just part of the industry. I really enjoyed the first few films in the MI franchise, but now it's just the same old rehashed storyline. I really wanted to like it. But instead I now feel obligated to expose this cash grab for what it really is. I'm confident that the truth will slowly come out and today's 8.5 rating on IMDB will eventually drop down to a 4.5 - which is still much higher than it deserves. No spoilers on the plot here. Just imagine a bunch of overpaid aged friends getting together to travel around the world to show off their fitness level. Even Baldwin dropped a few pounds. Come on guys.

An absolute blast at the movies.The action is top notch. The acting is more than serviceable. The plot is twisty-turny, treats its audience intelligently, and fun. What more could you want from a blockbuster?The perennially youthful Tom Cruise has found the perfect role in Ethan Hunt. It requires little more from him than running and looking serious. The rest of the IMF team (Simon Pegg and Ving Rhames) have charisma and a sense of humor that is able to buoy the movie and keep it from getting too serious. Henry Cavill is a great addition as the CIA man who's there to mainly use brute force to get through situations. He's got the perfect frame and straight delivery needed for the role.The plot jets around the world, hitting major globe-trotting destinations and filling them with really well executed action sequences. Chases evolve from utilizing trucks to motorcycles, zipping through traffic in Paris. They go on foot from underground to rooftops to an elevator. They're constantly moving, never settling with a single gimmick, but throwing more and more at the screen. The stuff filmed in IMAX, like the helicopter chase at the end, looks absolutely amazing.Production design is fantastic as well, especially at the large party in Paris. That mirrored hallway is just such a fun image.Everything about this movie is just the right kind of adult flavored action movie fun. It's not filled with quippy dialogue through entire action sequences. There's actually surprising little talking in the chases. When you're filling something tension filled with jokes, you're breaking the tension with each joke which prevents the sequence from really building properly. The chase through Paris, in particular, mounts with tension until its denouement and it's completely engrossing, in part, because it allows the action scene to be an action scene instead of a bit of comedic banter with action happening in between.The movie's' not a great intellectual exercise, but it exists proudly in a long tradition of thrilling entertainment that has graced the silver screen for a century. So very highly recommended.",

In a world where we barely have any real action anymore since everything is or uses bits of CGI, it is a huge breath of relief to be able to enjoy such jaw-dropping, mind-blowing, outstanding action set pieces! I know I have been writing this a lot throughout these reviews, but this one completely floored me. This is going to be the action movie to beat for a few years ... Maybe until the next Mission: Impossible installment, who knows?!My heart pumped like it never did before. The stuff that Tom Cruise actually does (which is basically everything) is unbelievable. Truly unbelievable, like you will have to get home and search for behind-the-scenes videos to understand how were they able to pull those sequences off. He runs like hell, jumps from building to building (you probably already know about the story of his broken foot), performs a HALO jump (a military parachuting free fall where the parachute is open at low altitude and the drop is performed at 25.000 feet), insanely drives a motorcycle through Paris streets, pilots a helicopter ... You got it, right?!This is the reason why the Mission: Impossible saga needs to continue. If it stops, there is never going to exist another film series that can bring such realism and incredible stunts like M:I does. It is undoubtedly the best action franchise of all-time, at least regarding the action set pieces. There is no possible comparison with any other movies. I am writing this because the ending might bother a few people.I have been having some bad luck with endings this year. There are a lot of films that I have watched and loved almost everything about it, but then its ending disappointed me in some way (Avengers: Infinity War, A Quiet Place and some more). I hate when directors tease a particular end, which would be a shock and something entirely unexpected, and at the last minute they back off and take the safe route.Christopher McQuarrie does that, but Fallout might be the only movie where I understand why he did it. I do not want to go into spoilers territory so I will justify it this way. If McQuarrie chose the bold ending, Fallout would probably be an A+, but the franchise would have to end as well (if it wanted to continue to be successful). By choosing the safe route, he guarantees the saga's vitality, but the film suffers from the issue in the last paragraph since everyone is going to leave the theater thinking \"oh, I wish they would have gone with THAT ending\".This is a minor issue that I have apart from another one regarding the first act's pacing. This is the longest movie of the saga and McQuarrie already answered why. Not to this question in particular, but he did admit that this film was structured around the action set pieces. Usually, this is a problem because it is often awfully executed. Never create a movie without writing your story and characters first. However, this is the sixth film of the franchise, and pretty much every significant character has been in the previous installments.Nevertheless, this justifies why the first act delivers so much information which causes the plot to start a bit convoluted. It eventually organizes itself, and it becomes a simple story, filled with predictable twists and turns that ultimately accomplishes its mission: to support the fantastic action sequences. Please, do not expect some Oscar-worthy screenplays from M:I movies because if you leave disappointed due to your unrealistic expectations, that's on you.As always, the cast is sensational and every character that we love and care about come back to one hell of a ride. I already blabbed about Cruise's courage, but there are a lot of exceptional performances. Simon Pegg (Benji) and Ving Rhames (Luther) are a hell of a team, providing some needed comic relief moments in such an action-heavy film. Rebecca Ferguson (Ilsa Faust) continues to be incredibly captivating, Michelle Monaghan (Julia) has some screentime to shine, and Alec Baldwin (Alan Hunley) also brings his A-game. Sean Harris (Solomon Lane) returns in style, and Henry Cavill (Walker) proves to be a fantastic addition to the saga, by being the protagonist of some of the most potent hand-to-hand combat in the series.Besides the action, every technical aspect is seamless. The cinematography is absolutely gorgeous, there are so many beautiful wide shots, and some of them are a true filmmaking achievement. The score is remarkable as it usually is in the M:I movies and it helps to raise some goosebumps in the vertiginous scenes (people with a fear of heights are gonna have a hard time with this one). The editing is perfect, and the tone and pacing are very well-balanced with the help of Rhames and Pegg's characters, who bring some stops to the extended action sequences (the driving around Paris sequence could have been shorter). There is still that sense of urgency and the frenetic pacing, which provides a significant level of entertainment.Mission: Impossible - Fallout is the best film of its franchise and one of the best action movies of all-time, regarding the execution of said action set pieces. Tom Cruise proves that he is an icon if not the biggest icon in action film history, through dozens of runs, jumps and God knows what more. McQuarrie brings his fantastic technical attributes to this movie and uses an exceptional cast to interpret remarkable characters. A simple yet captivating plot supports the excellent action, and it still carries a few (predictable) twists. Only a few nit-picky things forbid me from giving this film an A+, but I promise you, it will definitely be in my Top10 by the end of the year. Go see it! On IMAX! NOW!",

            "content": "Simple story, but great story-telling. Ensure you've seen the last 3 MI movies to enrich your viewing experience of this 6th installment. This is why I love seeing bonafide action star Tom Cruise's action movies because he does most of the physical stunts himself. Plus, there are no annoying shaky cam, obvious CGI, quick edits, and off-center/close up framing of the action scenes to hide: lazy action choreography/sequences, actors' terrible physicality *cough Scarlet Johanssen's lame Black Widow cough* and/or blatant stunt doubles. Complete viewing immersion and the suspension of disbelief does not get broken once in Fallout for me. I'm not sure if Rebecca Ferguson and Henry Cavill used stunt doubles because that's how great the action stunts are - all perfectly seamless between actors and stunt doubles. My pet peeve when seeing action movies is when the stunts/action are so blatantly done by the stunt doubles *cough Scarlet Johanssen's lame Black Widow cough*. (BTW, convincing action stars Emily Blunt or Rebecca Ferguson would've played a better Black Widow because they have the right physique/stature, athletic physicality, and a great wide range acting chops which would've done justice to the comics Black Widow).Every element of MI: Fallout falls in the spectrum of good to amazing. There is also moments of well timed and appropriate light comic relief provided by Simon Pegg that hits the marks unlike in a few Marvel movies. This movie is total entertainment and engaging from start to end. Fallout is best viewed on the big screen and is the best MI movie followed by Rogue Nation. My only complaint is that Rebecca Ferguson's Ilsa Faust didn't get enough fight scenes.",

            "content": "Found the first three films ones that had a lot to like (namely the action, the visuals, good casting on the whole and Philip Seymour Hoffmann's superb villain in the third) but also their faults (plot convolution in the first and third and the characters could have been written better in the second and third).'Ghost Protocool' to me was a great film and the best of the series since the original, and actually better than it, mainly because the story even though somewhat familiar seemed more focused and far less convoluted. 'Rogue Nation' was on 'Ghost Protocool's' very high level. Sure, there was a little bit of familiarity and the basic structure was somewhat formulaic, but 'Rogue Nation' had enough freshness and so much fast and furious excitement and thrills it doesn't feel like an issue.Contrary to the critical consensus that 'Mission Impossible-Fallout' is the best 'Mission Impossible' film, personally don't quite agree. It is definitely one of the best ones, and perhaps third place behind 'Ghost Protocool' and 'Rogue Nation' (my personal favourite).It does have a little too much going on in places and things get too complicated in spots. Ving Rhames is underused and doesn't seem to be enjoying himself in a basically nothing role.Some of the dialogue is also somewhat forced.Visually, 'Mission Impossible-Fallout' is even slicker and even more stylish than 'Ghost Protocool' and 'Rogue Nation', surpassing the latter as perhaps the most audacious of all six films put together. The locations, from sinister drabness to stunningly colourful, are a feast for the eye and the effect dazzle. The music doesn't overbear the action and such at all while making a pulsating impact thanks to the thrillingly authentic sound.The action is bigger, bolder and more dynamic than any other action scenes seen before in the previous four instalments. Many are breath-taking in their excitement and also nuances, hard to pick a favourite with such spectacular stunts and action scenes between the lightning storm, the motorcycle chase, the helicopter battle, the car chase, the London sprints and the toilet martial arts fight. Christopher McQuarrie's directing is again some of the best he's ever done, with a great sense of visual style and a real grasp of the storytelling.'Mission Impossible-Fallout' script is generally sharp, knowingly sophisticated with the humour (not cheesy or out of place) and intrigue superbly balanced. The story, the series' heaviest, darkest and most ambitious, is told at a breakneck pace without being rushed and grips one right in and never lets go, with the backstories providing some depth. There is, like with 'Rogue Nation' an appealing light-heartedness, tongue-in-cheek and suspense of superior tension and elegance (as far as the 'Mission Impossible' films go).Tom Cruise is very impressive, handling the stunts with effortless and enviable ease and acting with steely charisma. Rebecca Ferguson shows an even better and more confident knack for scene-stealing, with her in ersatz breath-of-fresh-air form. Sean Harris and Henry Cavill intimidate effectively, while Simon Pegg's comic relief in no way jars and is actually very funny and Jeremy Renner's presence is more than welcome. Vanessa Kirby, Alec Baldwin and Michelle Monaghan are also strong. It is a shame however that Ving Rhames is underused and lacking the charisma that he showed in 'Rogue Nation' despite being under-utilised in that too.On the whole, very good, just not amazing. One of the better 'Mission Impossible' films though and among the better films of the year, if not among the very best. 8/10 Bethany Cox",

FALLOUT comes just behind that, on par with the equally good GHOST PROTOCOL and ahead of the last one, ROGUE NATION. This time around, the scope is bigger, the budget is massive, and the endless action sequences make use of constant innovation to delight and offer the viewer stuff you've never seen before.Tom Cruise and his crew all return for an international twisty-turny tale. The writing isn't anything special and the constant twists and reveals are quite easy to guess throughout. I did enjoy seeing Henry Cavill in a hardman role and he gives as good as he gets with Cruise. The film's essentially one big action scene after another and they're mostly impressive and only occasionally cheesy. I would have liked a little more hand-to-hand combat, as there are only a couple of such scenes early on and they're really good, particularly the stand-out bathroom battle. The RAID films are a definite influence here. I'm not a big fan of CGI-assisted action but it does work a treat this time around and FALLOUT rivals the latest Marvel epics in terms of entertainment value. Bring on the next!",

Compare Fallout to the first Mission Impossible the series has improved from the original episode. Fallout falls somewhere in the middle. What worked: Well acted, and directed. Fallout's story has a fast pace which gives the viewer an adrenaline rush! Cruise, Baldwin, and Cavill have strong acting performances. There are sky diving, car chases, and a chopper chase which gives the audience action movie experience. What did not work: Rhames looked tired with the role; Unless that was Rhames goal. There was no Renner, which gave a missing dynamic to the Cruise/Renner clash of the last film. The switch-a roos I saw all of the plot twists coming. The two to three stories did not work out this time. The side love interest bogged down the main story, and the plot twist was too projected, which took the shock factor out of Fallout. If Fallout was the first episode I would say great movie, but expecting more Fallout slides into the middle. Fallout is six stars out of ten.",

Henry Cavill was my favorite part of the movie. He did such a good job. The action sequences are some of the best that I've seen in a movie in quite a while. They were so thrilling. So much happened in the film that sometimes it was jut a little too much at times but still it was good. The final act was probably the best part of the movie.

All of them are involved in the story and has an important role; plus we have Solomon Lane which I believe is a respectable villain. The story and events however are not that deep and exciting. A man who wants to destroy the world with the help of a corrupted agent has become an overtold and predictable story.In conclusion, Mission Impossible- Fallout is a very enjoyable movie.

The film was directed and written by Cruise's frequent filmmaking partner Christopher McQuarrie (who also performed both duties on the last sequel). Simon Pegg, Ving Rhames, Rebecca Ferguson, Sean Harris, Alec Baldwin and Michelle Monaghan all reprise their roles from other chapters as well; while Henry Cavill, Angela Bassett and Vanessa Kirby join the cast. The film has gotten almost unanimous positive reviews from critics (the best of the series, and some of the best for any film so far this year), and it's also another big hit at the Box Office as well.

What makes this entry so great, and maybe the best in the series, is the way everything is orchestrated.The plot centers around Ethan Hunt and his team trying to prevent a nuclear attack to prevent (much like in M:i-5).I must say that every single action (and non-action) scene of the film is very enjoyable. There are some very outstanding stunts and sequences, also plenty of comic scenes (I didn't expect that I would laugh this much), and the final 10 minutes excel at keeping the tension on. Despite the conclusion could have been predictable, up to the last second the viewer is in doubt whether Ethan and his team will succeed at saving the world or not. I really liked the visuals of the film. Much of the lighting seems to reproduce a nuclear blast, (the impending danger that has to be prevented) providing this entry of the series with a distinct visual style. There is definitely some very stunning photography that permeates most of this film's scenes.Christopher McQuarrie seems to give a different direction to some characters, particularly Ethan's wife from M:i-3 (introduced by Abrams) and Rebecca Ferguson's character, introduced in the previous film. The ending suggests that there are some options for a seventh film (which, given the success of this one, is most likely to happen).So far, 2018 releases, apart from a few exceptions were pretty much letdowns to me.

Cruise's enthusiasm for putting himself at genuine risk of death has seen these movies continuously trying to outdo each other, and the sixth in the series, Christopher McQuarrie's Fallout, is not only the most ambitious in scale and clinical in its execution, but may also just be one of the finest action pictures ever made. I never believed the sight of Cruise running across the outside of the 119th floor of Dubai's Burj Khalifa would ever be topped, but Fallout delivers not one but two superior set-pieces, and that's not even mentioning the rooftop-hopping that saw Cruise break his leg and carry on with the scene.Ethan Hunt and his Impossible Mission Force team are tasked this time with intercepting three plutonium cores in Berlin before they fall into the hands on an organisation called The Apostles, a terrorist group made up of survivors from The Syndicate. Joined by Luther (Ving Rhames) and Benji (Simon Pegg), the team fail in their mission when Hunt refuses to let one his own die. As the terrorists make off with the plutonium to sell to a mysterious buyer called John Lark, Hunt receives a dressing-down from CIA director Erika Sloane (Angela Bassett), who is furious at their failure to secure the weapons of mass destruction. She forces Hunt to take on CIA operative August Walker (Henry Cavill) as a shadow, and the odd couple head off to Paris to track down Alanna (Vanessa Kirby), an arms dealer they believe has connections to Lark. Double-crosses and high-speed chases ensue, as well as Tom Cruise's trademark run, as all paths start to lead back to Solomon Lane (Sean Harris), the formidable villain from last time.Christopher McQuarrie is the only director to have returned for a second stab at the Mission: Impossible gig, and the choice seems odd given how lacklustre Rogue Nation proved to be. But whatever he failed to grasp last time around he confidently nails here. McQuarrie and Cruise pull out all the stops, executing everything from a terrifying night-time sky-dive to a helicopter chase that sees Cruise plummet from the chopper's rails to the cargo swinging 40 feet below like veteran masters of the genre. The sheer risk and danger of some of the stunts pulled off here is gobsmacking, and Cruise can now comfortably sit alongside the likes of Jackie Chan as one of the greatest action stars ever. Cruise isn't the only star of course: Cavill particularly impresses as the deadpan slugger with a moustache so impressive it manage to cock up Justice League's re-shoots. Rhames and Pegg, who are both given larger roles than usual, can now banter like colleagues who have worked with each other for four movies, and reliable support is given by the likes of Rebecca Ferguson, Alec Baldwin and Michelle Monaghan. At two and a half hours, it can be argued that there's at least one climax too many, but I doubt anyone will be checking their watches.",

            "content": "While, some critics & fans said, this sixth film in the film series was the best movie yet. I have to disagree. Your mission, if you choose to accept it, is to understand, why. Read further to find out. Loosely based on the 1960's television series of the same name, the spy genre film directed by Christopher McQuarrie has once again, disappoint me in one department. The story. The script wasn't even finished, when they started with production. Because of that, the movie relies too much on bringing back so many familiar faces and making callbacks to earlier films that the motion picture's plot didn't really stand out, much. It built on the same foundation as the five preceding films were, meaning there will be a lot of same repetitive somewhat wearisome tropes like Ethan Hunt (Tom Cruise) getting framed, while trying to take down some vague criminal arm dealer organization from launching nuclear weapons upon the world like another terrorist group did in 2011's film, 'Mission Impossible: Ghost Protocol'. The story felt a little too generic to the point that the disavowed parts were self-aware lampshade in the film, by the deliberately trying to sabotage predictable wolf in sheep clothing villain. The movie was really missing the great twist and turns of the previous films. Every bait and switch was pretty much foreseeable. Even some of the action scenes like Ethan using his rock climbing skills, going on a motorcycle chase and disabling a helicopter felt like recreated reruns at times. Don't get me wrong, the set pieces still pack a punch, but the film seems to acknowledge that we've see these things before. The movie only tries to improve upon recycled safe tropes, rather than taking some climatic risk. It didn't give us, much of anything new. Regardless of the tiresome story; seeing Cruise perform death defying dangerous stunts in exotic locations around the world is entertaining and sheer adrenaline fuel. Some of the action set pieces were impressive, particularly in the brutal well-choreographed bathroom brawl with fight performer Liang Yang & the complex Parisian roof top jump scene where Cruise really did break his ankle on a stunt. However, I doubt any of them will be as memorable as the franchise's biggest past standout moments, such as Ethan hanging on a wire during CIA vault break in from the first movie or the agent climbing the Burj Khalifa in 'Ghost Protocol' or even him clinging to the side of an ascending cargo plane; which happen in 2015's 'Rogue Nation'. Regardless, fight coordinator Wolfgang Stegemann and stunt coordinator Wade Eastwood did a hell of a job, here. I just wish, McQuarrie didn't make up so many action sequences on the fly that Tom wanted to do; rather than planning it all out. It create a lot of action scenes having to be cut; due to pacing issues, like the helicopter about to hit a truck sequence, the assassins at the party scene and most of all, the car crash, in which the nuclear scientist was captured. Having them, cut left a lot of unanswered questions. Even some of the action moment left in the film doesn't even add up. It left a lot of jarring plot holes, like what was the whole point of the HALO jump, if anybody like can walk in, through the front door like Ilsa Faust (Rebecca Ferguson). Also, isn't it kinda weird to see barely any men in a very clean loo area during a crowded high class party? How about the agency getting realistic visual effects done in a short period of time for the news skit!? Then again, these might seem like nitpicks, but it really did take me out of the movie at times; in the same way, the heavy exposition intro dump in the beginning, did. I get it, you have to rewatch the previous movie to get, what's happen, here. Despite that, I found the performances in the film to be, very good. Despite, what's going on, in his personal life, I have to say; Cruise as Ethan seem a good guy to hang around. I love the use of inner struggle within Hunt about being a Good Samaritan. Seeing Ethan repeatedly goes the extra mile to save the lives of innocent individuals, while sacrificing his personal life & dealing with the horrible consequences for failure, make him into a tragic emotionally tortured hero. Sean Harris as Solomon Lane is the closest this franchise has to a traditional compelling villain. His delivery is cold and eerily. Unfortunately, Lane is rarely used much in this film besides as a MacGuffin. As for Henry Cavill's character, August Walker. He has proven as formidable physical foe/friend to Ethan, during the action scene, but his character and performance are fairly wooden, behind his grizzled hammer like appearance. I kinda wish, Jeremy Renner's character, Agent William Brandt from the previous movie was in this role. It would make the film, a little more shocking. Plus, it would solve the problems from mustache gate scandal with 2017's film 'Justice League', a lot better. Sadly, Renner couldn't return for this film as he was filming another movie. As for the rest of the supporting cast: Simon Pegg, Alec Baldwin & Ving Rhames were alright. Ferguson was also decent in this movie, even her character doesn't do much until the end. It's weird to think, that the actress was seven months pregnant while filming this. That impressive that she got through this film. As for the rest of the female performers, like Vanessa Kirby, Michelle Monaghan, and Angela Bassett, much more screen time was desired to see if they were worth having in this flick. Overall: This motion picture offers quite a thrilling ride. While, the film not as good as the previous films. It's impossible to think of good reasons why not to watch this movie. It's still worth lighting up the fuse & see what blows up. This film is highly enjoyable.",

            "content": "A mission impossible film, leading actor Tom Cruise with a bunch of supporting excellent actors marred by an abysmal cinematography and plot. Every or a 2 year duration Tom Cruise presents his fans with a jaw dropping action packed film with thrilling set pieces. But alas how could he even agree to star in this project is beyond me. Not a SINGLE and i mean NOT ONE NEW Gadget or tricks in this film is showcased in this film which usually remains a central plot or highlights in this franchise.Each and every film in this franchise has offered the fans with the introduction of a futuristic but somewhat plausible mind boggling tech and gadget. NOT THIS ONE.Oh and did i mention that there IS NO IMPOSSIBLE MISSION here to be overcome? \nThe \"Signature move\" or attraction of this franchise is missing. Yes you read that right. The main intense and jaw dropping sequence that is present in every film of this franchise up until now is missing. \nThe very first film had a a sequence of hanging in mid air while copying some intel, the 4th was Burj Khalifa scene, the fifth had the underwater tank scene.\n \nThis had real stunts performed by Cruise but with zero style or substance. I waited and waited but it never came for this movie because there wasn't one.\nThis film is overhyped to hell as dubbed to be the \"one of the best action films of all time\" by the media. \nApart from a few gunshots and fist fights, this film is a new low in the name of action. Two chase sequences are decent because of the cinematography and wide viewed shots and not because of the stylized methods of escaping/dodging. The hero ONLY RUNS/RIDES A VEHICLE during the chases and that too in as monotonous way. What was the use of even performing the stunts by himself Mr Cruise if your film doesn't even has some style to it.? \noh i get it to cause hype because your film doesn't have anything new to offer. Henry cavill although a great actor is wasted here. i guess cruise wanted to earn some quick money using the franchise's name while it still lasts.

            "content": "2015's \"MI: Rogue Nation\" was one of my favourite films of that year, so of all the summer blockbusters this was the one I was most looking forward to. Was I delighted? It's a slightly qualified \"YES!\". The film neatly follows on from Rogue Nation with arch terrorist-in-need-of-a-razor Solomon Lane (Sean Harris, \"Harry Brown\") being extraordinarily renditioned (probably not a valid phrase!) between multiple countries who want to torture/punish him. But his followers - \"The Disciples\" - are still active and on the trail of plutonium that could devestate key sites, with religious centres being the top of the target list. Since Ethan Hunt (Tom Cruise, \"American Made\") originally caught Lane, IMF Director Hunley (Alec Baldwin, \"It's Complicated\") despatches Hunt to intercept the plutonium.But CIA director Erica Sloan (Angela Bassett, \"Black Panther\") has no faith in the IMF, or trust that the organisation has not been infiltrated, and she insists that her 'heavy' August Walker (Henry Cavill, \"Man of Steel\", \"The Man From U.N.C.L.E.\") goes along for the ride. But they are not the only parties in play, for Isla Faust (Rebecca Ferguson, \"The Greatest Showman\", \"Life\") is also involved. But who is she working for?What makes these films a cut above your average action adventure is the stunt work, with the knowledge that Cruise is at the centre of the action. In \"Skyscraper\" you KNOW Dwayne Johnson is standing on the 'edge' in front of a big green screen. Similarly here you KNOW Cruise is standing on the edge of the Tate Modern tower - probably without a safety line - as the camera goes 360 degrees around him. This makes all the difference to the adrenalin count. There are some outstanding set pieces in the film, with extraordinarily spectacular shots from a 'halo jump' and a dramatic helicopter finale. But it is some of the smaller stuff that really impresses: a dramatic edge-of-the-seat car and motorbike chase through central Paris is one of the most impressive and terrifying things I've seen on film for many years; and Cruise's literally bone-crunching run through London is also extremely exciting, with Simon Pegg (\"Star Trek Beyond\") adding good humour in his regular role of Benji. By the way, series regulars Ving Rhames, as Luther, and Michelle Monaghan (\"Sleepless\", \"Patriot's Day\"), as Hunt's ex-wife Julia, also make welcome returns but Jeremy Renner is missing this time.Cruise at 56 (he's just 15 months younger than I am, damn it!) will eventually meet a Roger Moore-like Bond cliff when his Hunt role is no longer credible. But he's not there yet! Rebecca Ferguson is again outstanding as Faust and as a newcomer in a similar role Vanessa Kirby (memorable as Princess Margaret in \"The Crown\") impresses as the \"White Widow\" - someone with a familial link to a villain from the past! Unusually, for a film series which has traditionally been kept fresh by changing directors and composers at each turn, Christopher McQuarrie (\"Edge of Tomorrow\", \"The Mummy\") returns following \"Rogue Nation\", and he also writes the screenplay. The composing baton is handed over this time though to Lorne Balfe (\"Churchill\", \"Terminator: Genisys\") and for me this was a bit of a step down from the \"Rogue Nation\" soundtrack by Joe Kraemer which I really enjoyed.Is it sufficiently fresh though? Let's be clear here, I was enormously entertained throughout, and this should be near the top of your summer watch list. But it did ultimately feel at times a little like a light retread of \"Rogue Nation\". Some of the stunts - notably the Paris and London scenes as above - were a step up for me, but there are some annoyances in McQuarrie's script (see the spoiler section on bob-the-movie-man.com), so for me the rating plateaus at the same as I gave \"Rogue Nation\".(For the full graphical review, please visit bob-the-movie-man Thanks).",

It was incredible. The last film had a lot of problems, from the stilted, uptight, disconnected storytelling that lacked flow, the ridiculous product placement that made it hard to take the movie seriously(can't believe how many people did not spot the blatant ad for the military cargo jet by Airbus in Rogue Nation; yes, that was an ad, believe it or not, no bad guys would be flying a plane with the manufacturer's brand name and plane's model number on it. That took product placement to a whole new level for me).Like 3, this movie doesn't really have an impossible mission that requires ridiculous planning. To me, that works incredibly well because there's really only so many times you can pull this off before it gets trite.I absolutely loved the action scenes in the movie. Bravo, well done. Can't believe the Oscars do not give awards for this; whoever did the second-unit work for this movie did an amazing job. The helicopter chase in the Kashmir mountains was crazy.

Actually, the fist half is _boring_ about half of the time.The action sequences and plot/twists are not inspired and lack imagination. You see about 3 minutes into his appearance that \"Superman\" is the new villain (not just because Henry Cavil's Superman is a villain of sorts).

Michelle Monaghan is a hot grandma and Rebecca Ferguson is a hot aunt, but, that's it. The \"White Widow\" is simply not hot. Sure, Ethan Hunt is getting older, so it makes some sense, but, loses one of the crucial elements of the M:I formula.What we got is neither M:I, nor is it a \"real\" spy action thriller. It's something in between and it doesn't work very well.Having said all that, it's well done. It's actually more grounded than previous M:Is, though it is still way too silly.

            "content": "This review contains spoilers.Mission: Impossible - Fallout is the sixth movie in the Mission: Impossible franchise. The movie is a follow-up to 2015's Mission: Impossible - Rogue Nation. The movie takes place two years after the events of Mission: Impossible - Rogue Nation. The movie is written and directed by the same writer and director of Mission: Impossible - Rogue Nation, Christopher McQuarrie. The cast from the previous movie reprises their roles, including Sean Harris as Solomon Lane.After Solomon Lane's capture in Rogue Nation, the remains of The Syndicate are reformed into the Apostles. After a plutonium deal is intercepted by the Apostles, Ethan Hunt's Impossible Missions Force team are dispatched to retrieve the missing plutonium cores and stop the Apostles. After the mission ends in failure, August Walker, played by Henry Cavill, from the Central Intelligence Agency is embedded into Ethan Hunt's team.Mission: Impossible - Fallout is different from the previous movie installments. This movie does utilize callbacks to the earlier movies. This is the movie's greatest strength. The movies that this has the most connection to are Mission: Impossible Rogue Nation, Ghost Protocol, III. It does feel like Ethan Hunt is more of a character than in the previous movies. The audience can appreciate more of the character backstories that were started in the previous movies. Julia is brought back after small cameos in Ghost Protocol and Rogue Nation. Likewise Ilsa Faust returns to help Ethan with the threat of the Apostles. Solomon Lane also returns in a major role where he is a major driving force for the plot.The plot is much improved from Rogue Nation and earlier Mission: Impossible entries. The plot had clear character motivations where dialogue was not needed to explain character actions. It felt satisfying to watch a much more direct sequel than the previous movies. Anybody that likes plot-driven action will enjoy this movie.The action set pieces in this movie are absolutely wild. This movie's set pieces are a thrill to watch. They are simple in the concept but grander in the execution. The movie has Ethan Hunt in HALO jumping, escaping police in Paris, and chasing someone in a helicopter. All of these scenes are a treat to watch and even see the resolution of.I highly recommend Mission: Impossible-Fallout. This movie is one of the best Mission: Impossible movies.Grade: A",

The main characters are getting older and more human, but still able to fight to the best of their capabilities.The locations are relatively restrained: a third of the movie takes place in Paris - where they probably created some serious traffic congestions - then moves to London and ends up in Kashmir.The final fight is a spectacular helicopter battle.

Walker(Cavill, using his massive frame to be highly intimidating, letting loose as his Superman never does) is sent to keep an eye on, and if necessary take action against, Ethan(Cruise, not showing his age, ably diving deeper into the character's mind, which we haven't seen before), Benji(still amusing, vital) and Luther(Rhames, bringing up the past). Ilsa(Ferguson, remaining an enigma, as she should. if they make a 7th film, what they could do with her would be one of the main reasons I'd be excited about it. Not the only one, mind you) resurfaces. What is her goal? Who is she working for? Can she be trusted? Lane(Harris, even more sinister) may not be a free man(for now...), but his cause lives on in his followers, The Apostles. The only way to stop them is to find out the secret identity of their leader: John Lark.This keeps to an incredibly high pace. It does so with many extended, though not too long, action scenes(with several new incredible stunts, performed by Tom), and major plot twists, sometimes in short succession. I've seen the argument presented that by the end it doesn't make sense, and is overly difficult to follow, and I'm not sure I disagree. That's the only thing that takes away a point from my otherwise perfect rating for this. This is the first real sequel of this series, and it uses the history really well. A big retcon adds to the significant development of Hunt as a person. Meanwhile, you can watch this without knowing the other entries, it just won't have the same impact. This touches upon very real and serious concerns. Does the physics-defying, \" survive what you couldn't\" events diminish that? I don't think so, others do. Max(Kirby, imitating Redgrave beautifully) is the daughter of her namesake from the first movie, and is even more compelling than her(no easy feat), as well as given more to do. There is very moderate violence and brief strong language in this. I recommend this to anyone who enjoys spy fiction. 9/10",

Ethan Hunt barely ever pauses to let his love life interfere with his work, nor does he take time to swot up on his wine knowledge or choose a new bespoke suit. But each time he chooses a mission, what follows steadily are adrenalin-triggering exploits, loosely strung together by double-crosses and chicanery. And at the heart of it is the biggest movie star on the planet, still, a man who risks life and limb each time he steps up, to accomplish stunts we've never seen. Tom Cruise probably climbs the Cliffs Of Insanity before breakfast and rappels back down using his own discarded M:I-2 hair. He's sort of breathtaking.The plot sees Hunt face a terrifying nuclear threat from the acolytes of imprisoned anarchist baddie Solomon Lane (Sean Harris, still on supremely creepy form). Rebecca Ferguson's Ilsa Faust crosses his path again, on a conflicting mission of her own, while CIA agent August Walker (Henry Cavill, with moustache) is foisted on Hunt as a minder. He's a hammer to Hunt's scalpel, as CIA chief Erica Sloan (Angela Bassett) puts it, and despite the effectiveness of their partnership the two immediately clash.",

Movies with pay-per-hype ratings are destroying the film industry by drowning their credibility. This franchise is a joke. Rating a movie before anyone has seen it is a dead giveaway. It's a repetitive, predictable, and has zero heart. This is an over-hyped, cliched, boring magic trick. 10 star reviews might trick people out of their cash, but it will also destroy careers and the industry creating bait & switch films.Two years after the capture of a bad man; the remains of his organization reform into another all white terrorist group. Tom Cruise is given a mission to return stolen plutonium before they sell them to a \"fundy\". Tom recruits Ving Rhames & Simon Pegg for the mission. They fail when Tom chooses to save Ving's acting career over the lives of millions the plutonium will surely cause. They then decide to capture a nuclear weapons expert from a country that doesn't have a single nuclear power plant, because \"Why not?\"CIA boss Angela Bassett instructs Mustached-Superman to secretly follow Tom Cruise while he tries to get the plutonium. But Tom easily recognizes Mustached-Superman without his Clark Kent glasses. Soon Tom and Mustached-Superman sneak into a fundraiser party for arms dealers together. They track a man they suspect is a \"fundy\", but that guy is killed by the Swedish lady from the other 'MI' movies (She was in 'Life' with Ryan Reynolds). Tom quickly puts on the same terrible make-up disguise he uses in the other movies (a beard, but not one he's married to) and he meets up with another Swedish actress - the woman from Netflix's 'The Crown'. Tom warns her that terrorists have been sent to kill her and they run. Mustached-Superman tells Angela Bassett that Tom Cruise has always been the \"fundy\" he's disguised as. I went to the bathroom, because I had a Big Gulp an hour ago.Here's where it gets really dull and stupid: In order to get the plutonium, the woman from Netflix recruits Tom Cruise to rescue that same bad guy he captured two years ago (The guy from 'The Borgias' ... kinda looks like an old Prince Harry). Coincidentally (or lasily) enough; the bad guy is in a the back of an armored van convoy right there in the same city as Tom Cruise. The Netflix chick gives one of the plutoniums to Tom as a payment, so at least he's accomplished 1/8 of his original mission. It was about here I wondered where the hell did Ving Rhames & Simon Pegg go? Tom and Mustached-Superman do a bunch of unnecessary stuff that becomes a car chase through Paris. Ving & Simon reappear to save the Borgias bad guy. That first Swedish lady from before comes back (She was in 'Life' with Ryan Reynolds). She wants to kill Borgias to prove that she's loyal to the British CIA. But she doesn't, so I guess she's not. They rescue the bad guy and Netflix woman instructs the team to deliver the bad guy to London. I started looking at my watch wondering if it was ending - It was not.In London, we learn that Alec Baldwin is the secretary of the Impossible Mission Force (IMF). Alec confronts Tom about being the \"fundy\". Tom denies it. Alec Baldwin gets knocked out. It ends and I don't know what the point was. Tom, Ving & Simon trick Mustached-Superman into admitting he is the real \"fundy\". Apparently Mustached-Superman is working with Borgias guy and the terrorists. Let me try to explain this elaborate nonsense - They stole plutonium to get Tom Cruise branded as a nuclear terrorist. In reality Tom Cruise felt threatened by Mustached-Superman's goodlooks. Tom tells Angela Bassett, who instructs a United States team of agents to detain all of the United Kingdom agents. Tjhis movie is way too long. The CIA team has somehow been taken over by the terrorists and Mustached-Superman orders them to kill everyone. Mustached-Superman kills Alec Baldwin and escapes. Tom Cruise chases Mustached-Superman, but for all the running Tom does in everything he's in - he doesn't catch him. Mustached-Superman then threatens the life of one of Tom's estranged wives, Michelle Monaghan (She played Maggie in 'True Detective' - Oh, she did the voice of Wonder Woman in Justice League War' - neat). The Tom Cruise Flunkies decide that the Borgias guy will detonate the two remaining nuclear weapons over a glacier and contaminate the water supply of China. With a third of its population affected, the Chinese will get mad and Borgias hopes Hollywood will stop using them to make their films overseas. Borgias activates the weapons and gives the detonator to Mustached-Superman. Tom Cruise pursues him in a helicopter, leaving Ving Rhames, Simon Pegg, and Rebecca Ferguson (The nicer Swedish lady) to stay on the ground too watch Tom pressumably die in a helicopter, because that's how predictable the plot is. Ving Rhames and Wonder Woman find one bomb and poke it with a stick, but they are unable to defuse it. Rebecca Ferguson and Simon Pegg are also on the ground to worry about Tom when he eventually rams his helicopter into Mustached-Superman's invisible jet. They find the second weapon just as easily as Ving and Wonder found the other one, but they also capture the Borgias bad guy. It looks like the movie is rapping it up. After a long waste of time ( as predicted) Tom Cruise crashes his helicopter into Mustached-Superman's aircraft. Both of them survive and start fighting on a cliff edge where Mustached-Superman is killed. It seems to me he could have just dies in the crash. Tom Cruise gets control of the detonator, allowing Ving Rhames, Rebecca Ferguson, Simon Pegg, and Wonder Woman to deactivate the bombs, because that's how simple and basic nuclear weapons work. Angela Bassett hands the Borgias dude over to MI6 through the Swedish lady who gave Tom some plutonium, which somehow earns the other Swedish woman her exoneration. Tom Cruise recovers recovers from his injuries with the help of vitamins and exercise while Wonder Woman and the other cast join him in victory. The credits roll and there's a warning that noone will stop making these movies - especially in China.",

This movie definitely feels different and it was amazing to watch it, I had a lot of great emotions.

He's definitely an example for other actors and hopefully more actors will start making movies with a similar dedication.\nI watched this movie in 4DX format and it made it even more realistic, I definitely recommend it. After that I watched it twice more in 2D.This movie has really a lot of stunts. \nAmazing halo jump scene, fighting scene, shooting scene, motorbike chase scene, car chase scene, amazing intense TC running scene, helicopter chase scene... It's absolutely amazing stunts and all done with no CGI and 100% Tom Cruise!Sound: sound effects and music were selected very carefully and it's amazing how good it is in this movie. It is great to listen, it's very satisfying, if definitely feels very high quality.Filming style and colors also feel very special, very high quality like LOTR, but in modern times and realistic.

No Kidding, this Action-Spy affair offers spectacular Action from the word go. Be it the hand-to-hand combat, or mesmeric car chases or even helicopters flying up and above, this film has it all. I was left awe-struck & felt richly rewarded all through the film. Clearly, 'Fallout' has taken the action level way up & hence, only the MI Series have to top themselves, here-on.Writer-Director Christopher McQuarrie's motive is simple: Leave the Action buffs overwhelmed. And he does! While his Screenplay moves on a fast-pace, despite its wafter-thin plot, its the action here that's the mainstay of the enterprise. McQuarrie's Direction is an Action-Packed dream, where its bad-ass leading-man races, chases, flies & bashes up the baddies, with much glory. A special mention & respect for the extraordinary Action-Sequences, that have been envisioned, choreographed & executed, astonishingly. Each & Every punch is effective to the core! Clearly, the stunts & the aggression are the soul of the film. Hats Off!The Cinematography by Rob Hardy captures all the action & carnage to stupendous effect. Eddie Hamilton's Editing is razor-crisp. Art & Costume Design are efficient. Lorne Balfe's Score is superb. Performance-Wise: Tom Cruise roars as Ethan Hunt! The 56-year old Superstar oozes energy & charisma from start to end. Its a delight to watch him take on the bad-guys once again & give them their desserts. Ving Rhames & Simon Pegg are lovable, yet again. Rebecca Ferguson does a stellar job. Sean Harris continues to be a strong, conniving villain. Henry Cavill is fair. Alec Baldwin & Angela Bassett make brief, but arresting appearances. Vanessa Kirby is first-rate. Michelle Monaghan is perfect. Others lend support.On the whole, 'Mission: Impossible - Fallout' is an Action Extravaganza! It has Blockbuster written all over it! Grab a ticket now! And yes, Mad Maxx: Fury Road has finally found its competitor. And that's no small achievement.",

The parts were good and lived up to the high standard set up by this franchise. But in between there were long deserts of boring dialogue, exposition and muffed attempts at misdirection. At some point the idea of a plot twist loses all meaning if you have too many of them. And unfortunately as much credit as I give Tom Cruise for being in good shape enough to handle those action scenes, he just looked soo tired in some of them. You expected him to throw up his hands after a long grueling fight and say \" You know what? Just take the plutonium I need a nap.\" I would have liked it a lot more if they had kept it to about 2 hours. Lean and mean from scene to scene. It's tough to switch gears from adrenaline filled thrill ride to heart felt touching drama to BBC style dry exposition without losing something along the wayThis movie is probably best enjoyed at home where you can speed on past all the filler and enjoy the good stuff.",

            "content": "More than halfway through the 6th installment of Mission Impossible (aptly subtitled \"Fallout\"), the CIA is infiltrated by a bunch of bad guys known as The Apostles. They manage to grab dangerous international anarchist Solomon Lane (Sean Harris). from the clutches of Ethan Hunt (Tom Cruise) and his crack IMF team consisting of Benji Dunn (Simon Pegg) and Luther Stickell (Ving Rhames). Behind all this is fundamentalist John Lark, who is assigned to shadow Hunt at the beginning of the film posing as a CIA operative. How he actually gets his men into position to retake Lane is never explained. It's not exactly essential to explain how everything works in a thriller such as this as we're too busy marveling at all non-stop derring-do (led primarily by Tom Cruise, who does all his own stunts). \nThe basic plot involves Hunt being assigned to retrieve three plutonium cores which the Apostles end up stealing from him after Luther is briefly held hostage and Hunt must save his life (in the process losing the cores).The narrative is dependent on a series of very entertaining plot twists, the first of which involves Hunt and his team deceiving nuclear weapons expert Nils Debruu into revealing where an arms dealer named The White Widow (Vanessa Kirby) is planning to meet Lark. \nThe following developments will keep you glued to your seat as they involve incredible stunts, all of which Tom Cruise is at the heart of: 1) Cruise as Hunt must save the CIA agent Walker (later revealed to be Lark) as he's knocked out by lightning while parachuting over Paris; 2) Cruise and Lark have death-defying hand-to-hand combat with a man who poses as Lark in a bathroom 3) the IMF team extracts Lane from a convoy after they knock his armored vehicle off a bridge and Cruise leads cops on an incredible motorcycle chase in which he's constantly riding in wrong-way traffic; 4) Cruise chases Lark on foot through Paris in an unsuccessful attempt to apprehend him. \nAll the excitement culminates in Kashmir, where the IMF team learns that Lane is planning to explode two of the plutonium cores (earlier the White Widow gave Hunt one of the cores as down payment for Lane). There is an incredible helicopter chase in which Hunt eventually prevents the nuclear explosions by killing Lark and obtaining a key that's part of the detonator. Meanwhile, Benji and Luther (joined by Hunt's ex-flame Ilsa Faust played by Rebecca Ferguson along with Hunt's ex-wife, Michelle Monaghan as Julia Meade) must disable the nuclear cores manually after a 15 ,minute countdown has already been initiated by Lark. \nRounding out the fine cast is Alec Baldwin as the IMF boss who's killed in an altercation with Walker (aka Lark) and the CIA head, Angela Bassett, whom eventually eats crow after allowing Lark to infiltrate her agency. As stated above, not everything here makes sense, or rather it's not sufficiently explained. But the plot twists and incredible stunts will keep you riveted to your seat. At 56, Tom Cruise must be commended for keeping himself in shape and doing all his own stunts (despite breaking his ankle while filming in mid-production).",

That's really too much for me... What's wrong with adding some realism, for the love of God!? I think these movies would gain a lot if they leveled up the common sense bar, just a little, so the audience don't have to feel so cheated and dumb!Anyways... the same old story.

            "content": "Mission: Impossible - Fallout is the first time in the franchise when a director has not been changed between movies. Originally, Tom Cruise wanted to keep things fresh by having a new voice every time, but apparently he was so impressed with Rogue Nation's Christopher McQuarrie that he asked the man to direct more.And now McQuarrie is apparently permanently attached to this franchise. And for a good reason. He has a good voice, knows how to direct action, has interesting storylines and his characters are some of the best additions to the franchise since Simon Pegg's Dunn.Fallout is also the first Mission: Impossible film to continue the storyline from a previous movie. Sure, there was a mention of the Syndicate at the end of Ghost Protocol, which technically ties all three of these together, but that hardly counts. Not when Fallout has both the main villain and the main lady of Rogue Nation returning in full force. Even the main threat is eerily similar, but in a logical, pleasing way.And it works. I haven't minded at all that all previous Mission: Impossible films have been stand-alones, and Ghost Protocol is still my favourite in the franchise, but neither do I mind there being continuity. Especially when done this well.As for the new stuff, I liked Henry Cavill in his role. The twist was a tad obvious, but they executed it well, and Cavill's physical presence gave the role much needed menace. Not to mention the man can act. I also really enjoyed Vanessa Kirby as a sophisticated high-end black market broker.If I had to name any flaws, I'd probably call out the fact that they didn't get out as much from Rebecca Ferguson's Ilsa. She's still a good character and a welcome addition to the franchise, but some of that zest has been lost between movies. And I blame the script more than Ferguson herself. Still, a minor gripe at best.Fallout falls just a bit short of Rogue Nation, but it's still one of the best action movies of the 21st century. Breathtaking stunts, great characters, high stakes, exotic locations, practical effects, diabolical schemes, and the kitchen sink too. What's not to like?",

            "content": "The MISSION IMPOSSIBLE series of films is an undeniable hit. Any series of films that can make it to six films qualifies. They've been able to do so with a continuing cast, adding members as they've gone along says a lot about the team behind the movies. That they've been able to go this far and continue to make exciting action packed films that don't play to the lowest common denominator is something to be proud of. This week the sixth film in the series, MISSION IMPOSSIBLE: FALLOUT makes its way to disc and odds are it will be this week's hot rental.At the end of the previous installment (MISSION IMPOSSIBLE: ROGUE NATION) Ethan Hunt (Tom Cruise) and his team were able to track down and capture Solomon Lane (Sean Harris) the man they felt was tip of the iceberg for a group known as The Syndicate, a criminal consortium many in intelligence didn't believe existed. With Lane in custody that attitude changed and so did the Syndicate. With his capture the group is now a rogue terrorist group called the Apostles.As the film opens Hunt is on a mission to buy 3 plutonium cores in Berlin. With Benji Dunn (Simon Pegg) and Luther Stickell (Ving Rhames) on his team he is caught off guard when the Apostles take Luther hostage. To save his life Hunt allows the plutonium to leave his hands and a new mission is assembled to track down nuclear weapons expert Nils Debruuk, a man who designed nuclear devices for John Lark. They do so in the hopes of using him to find Lark, a man they are certain has plans for those devises and the plutonium.CIA Director Erica Sloane (Angela Bassett) is not pleased with this turn of events. In an effort to rein in the IMF team and save face she assigns Special Activities Director agent August Walker (Henry Cavill) to shadow Hunt and his team every step of the way. As the team shifts into gear to take on a different challenge their mission changes from moment to moment as new players enter the arena. When one contact they are supposed to meet is killed they set out after the killer, the mission morphing into something new.Along the way the team encounters MI6 agent Ilsa Faust (Rebecca Ferguson) who we met in the previous film. But is she there to help or to hinder them? Cross, double crosses and triple crosses are found throughout the film and it isn't until the final 30 minutes or so that we know just who is responsible for what and what they then intend to do. Needless to say it isn't something good and is in fact devastating for the world. But isn't that always the case in these films?The movie is an action packed thrill ride from start to finish. But it's not just those action fueled moments that make the film work on various levels. The movie works because it's smart and has a deep story behind it. It works because you find yourself caring for the characters we've come to know and love in the course of six films. It works because it combines the action and intelligent story with humor and emotions, a difficult mix at best and one that they seem to accomplish with ease.Cruise continues to show why he's one of today's top stars. He has a charisma about him that is undeniable. He also seems to have found that fountain of youth in his appearance that only Dick Clark seemed privy to. Still insistent on doing many of his own stunts he broke his ankle doing one of these, a painful item to watch is you go looking for it. In an interview the cast members when asked what he did after it happened said he got up and continued walking on it until the shot was done.The rest of the cast is amazingly comfortable in their roles as well. Pegg remains the comic relief and does it well. Rhames is the tech wizard who cares more about his friend than many realize. Ferguson shows that she is worthy of being on the team and let's hope she remains there if the series continues. And Cavill shows that he can handle a role other than Superman and do a solid job of it.I've found I've been able to watch and re-watch all of the movies in the series and know I will continue to do so in the foreseeable future. They're never tiring and always guarantee a good night's film to watch. This one is no different. The only problem with the film is the same problem the others had. It ends and leaves you wanting more. So let's hope that the success of this film ignites the spark for them to carry on. If James Bond can reach double digits then why not Ethan Hunt?",

            "content": "Much like the franchise as a whole, Fallout is a film that engages you with just how much is going on and how quickly it is going on, but at the same time it doesn't serve it that you are too engaged lest you see the deep holes in any specific moment of the plot. So it is here, but it does what it does very well by producing thrills or action in such a consistent way that it is very easy to engage it on the superficial level but still feel like you're really into it. To illustrate this point, the trailers etc leave you in no doubt as to who the villain of the film is, but it doesn't really matter that we know that destination, because we're along for the ride itself.In this regard the film delivers, albeit in a way that does rather undo itself. At the end of the film there wasn't a massive 'high' of a sequence like with some films, and I wondered why - realizing that the reason was that every few minutes was a sequence with high stakes, great effects, and engagingly real stunts. This consistency and intensity of the action does give you a strong ride, but the small downside is that it rounds off the highs and reduces the impact of any one scene. A small problem though. A bigger weakness in the film is that the plot is so heavily reliant on coincidence and convenience, to the point where really very little matters unless you have been totally sold on only working 1\" into the plotting. The performances work against this well though, offering more than is really there to be had. Cruise plays a conflicted hero despite the material not really giving him much to justify it. Cavill is a strong physical presence and offsets against Cruise well. Rhames, Pegg, Harris, Bassett, Baldwin, and others all add quality in smaller roles, which does make a difference. McQuarrie directs with pace, and DP Hardy gets the best of the locations throughout.In the end, Fallout is impressively slick and entertaining. It doesn't aim to challenge your brain too much, but it dresses up smarter than it is, and offers plenty to help you avoid seeing that.",

Raising the bar not only for its own franchise but for action movies in general it's a real adrenaline rush as it sets its big, and I do mean big, set-pieces in firstly two familiar locations, Paris and London, before climaxing in an extended sequence in Kashmir where we basically witness a chicken run between two fully airborne helicopters.There are brief moments of scene-setting, plot progressing calm but don't dwell on these too much as before you can cogitate the motivations and machinations of the baddies, you're hurtled into the next white knuckle ride segment. So don't look for much in the way of character development or psychological insight, just strap in and watch the IMF team race to stop a planned nuclear explosion by the skin of the skin of their teeth.The same team as finished the last mission re-assemble here with Tom Cruise as leader Ethan Hunt, Simon Pegg's Benji and Ving Rhames' Luther fairly soon re-joined by Rebecca Ferguson's Black Widow Ilsa and forcibly augmented by Henry Cavill's CIA Inside operative Walker. Pegg and Rhames as before provide the light relief and pathos, Ferguson the female all-action counterpoint to Hunt's daredevil persona.The trick of course to making a film like this still work six movies in is to ramp up those amazing stunt sequences, from a near-fatal double sky-dive over Paris, a brutal punch-up in a toilet, car and motor cycle chase also in Paris, an extended pursuit across the London skyline, yes including that scene where Cruise breaks his ankle on one roof-leap too far and culminating in the duelling 'copters scene at the end and a to-the-death final fist-fight on a sheer rock face about a million feet up.I still appreciated the nods to the classic TV series from which it first sprang, most obviously the use of a not-too-different version of the classic theme tune, the pre-highlights reel and \"Your mission, should you decide to accept it\" prologue even as it's obvious that from there it's the original show on super-steroids.Anyway, it was a blast of a way to spend a Saturday afternoon and left you at the end wondering just how Cruise and his creative team could top this next time out.",

Then I decided to watch it the second time and it was then I became quite keen, indeed obsessed to watch it again on the BluRay version. That's is when I figured it's magnificence.In my personal opinion, the musical score is the best ever after Mission Impossible 2 composer Hans Zimmer's score. I felt that throughout the film the composer Lorne Balfe has done an enormously terrific job. If I might add \"The noise of the musical score was louder than the stunts.\"The director Christopher McQuarrie has written and executed a terrific script, he's got his tone mixed up in it. The storyline was written complex. He's done certain callbacks to previous Mission Impossible films, and they are like \"under the surface,\" which means I won't know it if I haven't watched the previous ones. That's the genius of this writer and director.The cinematography was unique compared to the other films cameras being placed and shot from vast angles. Especially during the last stunt sequence between Tom and Henry. The London chase over the roof, and the scene where they break Lane out of Prison.Henry Cavill is the ideal person for the role of John Lark and he's got his own version of being an antagonist. Especially being a Dark tone, the scene in the cave in London when he turns around and goes \"Do you?\"\nThat last stunt sequence on the mountains of New Zealand.And I won't have to applaud Tom, for he is indeed the guy who made me follow the franchise and I wager this is the best since Ghost Protocol.His absence from the world stage has had unintended consequences\nHis syndicate of rogue covert operatives continues to wreak havoc around the globe.",

I am not sure how they manage to up their stunt game every time but they do hands down. The action in the film is unreal and if you keep in the back of your mind that Tom Cruise is doing almost all of his own stunts is pretty impressive. The guy is a beast. The other nice thing that has upped the game for us in this film is Superman, himself, Henry Cavill. The man is built like a tank and takes on the role of CIA skull-cracker August Walker. His fighting scenes are brutal, to say the least. Rebecca Ferguson is back in the role of Ilsa Faust and she is kicking all kinds of ass throughout the film, usually while on the back of a motorcycle. And if you are looking for the heart of the team Ving Rhames and Simon Pegg are back in the roles of Luther and Benji just to keep things on the level. Writer/Director Christopher McQuarrie and writer Bruce Geller have done a great job weaving together this high-action spy tale. They have really created a fun and intense film for audiences to enjoy. Honestly, I am not even sure how you can come up with writing a story that weaves in and out of itself as well as they have here, but they have done it. You don't necessarily need to have seen the previous films to follow this, but it will certainly help you keep up with the story a little easier since there are lots of references to past films, old missions, and character storylines especially with Michelle Monaghan's role as Julia Meade-Hunt. Seeing this film will almost want to make you go back and rewatch the previous ones anyway, so maybe a refresher is in order before seeing this. Overall, this is a kick-ass film. There is so much happening at any turn that you are almost guaranteed not to get bored. If suspense is your thing then be in the right place this weekend and buckle up for a Mission: Impossible to not-accept. Seriously!",

Also impressive were the new inductees to the franchise August Walker and the White Widow. This franchise, however, is best known for its great action sequences. In this film, there are so many amazing sequences that from beginning to end it's an almost non-stop thrill ride. There's a fantastically choreographed fight scene in a bathroom, a motorbike chase through the streets of Paris, a thrilling skydive, a helicopter battle, shootouts, the obligatory Tom Cruise trademark running scene and much more to keep you on the edge of your seat. As far as action set pieces go, this film surely delivers. However, the plot is mostly forgettable and fairly predicable, and is full of twists and turns to the point where you're never really sure what a number of the characters' agendas truly are. That said, because the films are so much fun, it's not a major obstacle to enjoying them. Overall, At the end of the day it's another addition to the already great franchise of films where the plot is fine, but the set pieces are excellent",

That is definitely true for the latest entry: Mission: Impossible- Fallout, which has a Rotten Tomatoes score of 98%. And I am here to tell you that the reviews for the movie are more or less true and that it is DEFINITELY ONE OF THE BEST ACTION MOVIES OF RECENT YEARS AND IS THE BEST MISSION: IMPOSSIBLE MOVIE EVER!!! Fallout's story is great and full of twists and some moments of genuine shock (like the scene where I thought they killed off the Pope). But then again, some. The villain's plot is decently original and introduced a new idea- what if Ethan Hunt were to become an outlaw? Tom Cruise does a great job acting, as usual. But the supporting cast does an amazing job too. Henry Cavill does a great job as tough CIA agent August Walker, Ving Rhames does a great job as Ethan's longtime assistant Luther Stickell, Simon Pegg does a great job as Ethan's other longtime assistant and joke-cracker Benji Dunn, Rebecca Ferguson does a great job playing determined MI6 agent Ilsa Faust, Sean Harris does a great job playing former Syndicate terrorist organization leader/madman Solomon Lane, Angela Bassett does a great job playing rough CIA leader Ericka Sloane, Vanessa Kirby does a great job playing radical activist/terrorist cooperator The White Widow, Michelle Monaghan does a great job playing medical worker/Ethan's former wife Julia, and Alec Baldwin does a great job of playing smart, Ethan-faithful MIO leader Alan Hunley. Also, the over-the-top stunts and action sequences were definitely the series best, without question. From the skydiving sequence to the helicopter chase sequence, this movie's stunts have it all. The cinematography, special effects, and fight choreography are also stellar. The cinematography is breathtaking, with many beautiful breathtaking shots of mountains and cities. The special effects are very modern and up-to-date. And the fight choreography is very realistic and brutal (for a PG-13 movie, that is). However, this movie's music is somewhat forgettable- but the humor isn't at all. There are lots and lots of funny moments throughout the film that lighten it up a bit. And last but not least, Mission: Impossible- Fallout also boats good editing and sound and an ending that will leave you on the edge of your seat with your teeth chattering. Despite a few very very minor setbacks, this movie features tons and tons of hair-easing action and a near-perfect story which makes it a near perfect film. One of the best action movies of recent years, without a doubt. Watch it when you have the chance, because I guarantee it will blow your mind.",

Filled with some genuinely jaw-dropping set-pieces and a frenetic and non-stop energy, Fallout may just be a franchise high and quite easily the action event of the year, tailor-made for the biggest screen available to your viewing needs.4 bathroom stalls out of 5",

No, producers/directors have a duty to polish what may be a dumb screenplay into a plausible action story, but this fails in almost every key scene. The bathroom scene starts off plausibly with a lot of people coming/going from it but when the decent fight scene starts, no other party patrons enter, despite all the noise/commotion - fail. The Grand Palais scene equally silly with the crowd simply not reacting/stampeding for the exits after an expansive knife fight - fail. Pointless chase scenes through populated Paris where no bystanders are hurt, or worse yet, there aren't even any bystanders - in - populated - Paris - fail. And then his chase to Walker, brushing off multiple injuries, why not just make him a superhero at this point?! Fail. And the dialogue is just so unrealistic and melodramatic - fail.

This film easily takes the franchise to another level and proves that with a great cast, crew, director and writers that sequels and series can progress the story and get even better.This film picks up 2 years after Rogue Nation and we get a better insight into Ethan Hunt as a character and his motivations. We learn although Ethan stopped the syndicate, the syndicate agents left alive now call themselves The Apostles. Due to a tough decision Ethan makes the Apostles now have Platonium and so begins our heroes globe trotting heroics to stop a nuclear disaster. The bond of the team (Cruise, Ferguson, Cavill, Pegg and Rhames) is what makes this work and the chemistry of the cast is amazing. I loved Michelle Monaghan in this film for the few scenes she has. The chemistry with Cruise is emotional and I love their story together and where it has gone.Sean Harris is just excellent at playing the yin to Cruises Yang.Henry Cavill is a welcome addition to the series and honestly probably steals the film with his reloaded fists. The bathroom fight scene is easily one of the best fight scenes I've ever seen. It was great to see him get his teeth into a different type of role. He won't disappoint. I also loved that that for the first time they referenced the other sequels which was brilliant but for anyone who hasn't seen the previous movies it will not go over their heads or need to have seen them. Now, the action sequences which is what we all go to a mission impossible film to see. Tom cruise takes them to the next level and although you know he is well. It's crazy to watch on the screen knowing he did that for real! The helicopter fall scene, rooftop jump are all deep breath moments. I actually said ouch at the rooftop jump knowing he broke his ankle for that scene. I applaud him and the crew for raising the bar.

McQuarrie goes out of his way to explain why Hunt's marriage to Michelle Monaghan's Julia Meade character from the third movie couldn't last.Here the cast are on top form Tom Cruise and Henry Cavill's Agent Walker bounce perfectly off each other as they attempt to corner a despicable arms dealer named John Lark. Both Hunt's IMF boss played excellent by Alec Baldwin and Simon Pegg get physical and Ving Rhames add some unexpectedly emotion clout. Sean Harris returns as Solomon Lane who is as intense and nonchalant as ever. Vanessa Kirby leaves an impression, possibly for a comeback in a sequel, Milla Jovovich-ish Rebecca Ferguson as Ilsa Faust s impressive especially during the action sequences. Notably Wes Bentley an actor who fell off the radar is given second life, briefly appearing as Patrick, Julia's second husband.The big action set ups in Paris and London are memorable, injected with exciting score by Lorne Balfe. Unexpectedly Fall Out feels fresh and moves the series forward. Even though you can see some story twists coming a mile off there are genuine surprise moments along with proper thematic substance in amongst the white-knuckle moments. Undeniably the best entry in the franchise, re-establishing Cruise's status as an action superstar. Highly recommended.",

No one came off well and the damn thing was long. Again the fate of the world hung on absolute chance and individual action, and the plot was silly, the original loss of the plutonium balls was Monty Python stupid and the manner in which the plutonium was handled was cartoonish, again, way beyond the acceptable silly for this franchise. I suppose my main point is that it simply wasn't enjoyable, everything seemed forced and there was a lot of repetition, not just within the movie, but across the movies. Remember the first movie that had the spectacular and improbably helicopter stunts........well, we get more of that here. And, things were predictable, and often the payoff explanations were trivial. This was a phoned-in effort. Spend your money somewhere else.",

My only problem was that the aspect ratio could have been the same for the entire movie not just for IMAX scenes but I'll let it go. Nolan already familiarised us with this through the Dark Knight Trilogy.Henry Cavill was a good addition and from the get go the \"big surprise or plot twist\" was expected because no movie of this franchise would cast a big actor along with Tom Cruise just to \"team up\". So yeah, the reveal of \"John Lark\" as Walker was expected.The action sequences were very clean and satisfying. The biggest thing I like about MI series is that the fight sequences and chase sequences are satisfying and good to watch.I think MI: Fallout was the Skyfall of MI franchise. Skyfall is my favourite of the bond series of Daniel Craig and Fallout is for MI series. Love Simon Pegg, Rebecca is beautiful and resourceful. Michelle Monaghan was welcomed well too. In all, a nice movie, not a perfect one mind you, but still it deserves a 10 because-\n1. The score and sound mixing\n2. The IMAX scenes.\n3. The HALO jump by Cruise\n4. The redeeming action\n5.

            "content": "They say lightning never strikes twice, much less three times. Yet for the third time in a row the Mission Impossible franchise has absolutely nailed it, delivering heart pounding, supremely satisfying summer entertainment.Those who have seen the trailers will have a basic idea of the story. Ethan Hunt and his team lost a trio of plutonium cores, and now he has to get them back by whatever methods necessary. Now despite what the trailers suggest, this movie is not about Ethan snapping and going rogue. The movie never even suggests it. But it is very much about whether he'll reach his limits and break his own most deeply held rules to complete the mission. Because with the stakes this high and with so many different players and agendas, there may not be any way to save the world and keep his hands clean.This movie is also very much about Ethan's past. In many ways this installment is a continuation of the last film, featuring old friends and enemies and tying up loose plots threads you never noticed before. So much of what happens here is the direct result of the missions Ethan has completed and the choices he made before, all of them weighing heavily on the choices he has to make now.After six installments in the series the filmmakers have fully perfected the Mission Impossible formula. The pacing ranges from quick to breakneck. The chases and shoot-outs are excellent as always, and some of the fight scenes are worthy of Hong Kong. Henry Cavil is a powerhouse. The pure power of his fighting style is a perfect match for Hunt's kinetic improvisation. Fighting together they make a hell of a duo. When they come to blows with each other it's even better.And then there are the aerial sequences and other death-defying stunts that no Mission Impossible movie would be complete without. They may not top the data core scene from the last installment, but they are still absolutely breathtaking. I don't know how Cruise is able to keep doing these kinds of stunts at his age, but I can't argue with the results.And refreshingly, the plot is more than just an excuse to string together the action scenes. There are enough twists and stunning revelations to fill the best spy novel. Just when you think you know where it's going it manages to surprise and raise the stakes even higher. At times Fallout is a bit darker and grimmer than previous installments. Occasionally it even brings a touch of pathos. But the trademark wry humor is still there, if a little more subdued.\nUltimately this movie has everything that a summer blockbuster should. It's tense, exciting, action packed, and everything in it just works. On the heels of Ghost Protocol and Rogue Nation it's safe to say that the Mission Impossible franchise is delivering more consistently than than James Bond. I don't how long they can keep this up, but I look forward to finding out.",

For instance there's many films that have car/chase sequences in France, namely Paris, and when you've seen one they start to get old. This film's chase sequences on Paris felt exciting to watch and tense, especially as events unfold and catch you off guard leaving you guessing what will happen next.The storyline is solid and follows elements of past movies, with an antagonist making a return and other cast too. There's a lot of twists that catch you off guard and story can shift direction quickly, at risk of confusing people unless they pay attention to characters names and small cues, but ultimately not so convoluted you're left a bit lost. There's also some humorous moments brought in especially by Simon Pegg well known for his comical side, and well choreographed fight scenes, a toilet scene in particular.Overall an enjoyable movie and certainly not boring.",

He is to disable the new Syndicate called the Apostles led by John Lark, and no one knows what he looks like. Nice, eh?You know the ultimate goal Ethen Hunt is tasked with, but there will be many twists and turns and this will become quite complicated at times. There are many scenes trying to figure out who John Lark is. Just keep an eye on those bombs and this will become most enjoyable.With the fight stunts, going the wrong way on a motorcyle being chased by Assassins at the Arc de Triomphe, racing around Paris in a souped up BMW, climbing into an airborne helicopter and clinging to dear life on the side of a very smooth mountain wall you will need to catch your breath often. These scenes are absolutely mind-boggling and you wonder how well they were done without mishaps. You do know that Tom Cruise does his own stunts, right? Oh, almost forgot: Cruise as Hunt leaps across open spaces from one building to another. Something inside of me said that can't happen. With Cruise it's more than just movie magic. (Indeed)This is probably the best Mission Impossible ever and we are forever grateful, but we keep hoping no one gets hurt. I held my breath often. You'll see.Notables: Henry Cavill (with mustache and the beginnings of a beard) as Walker, an Assassin forced to work with Hunt, but is willing to kill him if need be; Simon Pegg as Benji, a member of the IMF Team; Rebecca Ferguson as Ilisa, a MI-6 Agent who needs to prove herself to MI -6 to finally be free of them and she has feelings for Hunt; Angela Bassett as Erika, CIA chief; Alec Baldwin as a U.S. Secretary, of Defense or State (wasn't clear); Michelle Monaghan as Julia, Hunt's former wife; Vanessa Kirby as The White Widow: she brokers deals between governments; Christopher Joner as Nils Debruuk, who made the bombs.It does surprise me that actors from these kinds if action movies never get Oscars or even get nominated for one. That's a pity because these actors are every bit Oscar-Worthy. Bummer. These are great actors.At the end, I was hoping that Ethen Hunt would say he wanted to learn how to learn how to fly a helicopter. Remember he was in one when everything went wrong. You'll see.

It doesn't matter, because everybody watches this kind of movie for the action scenes and a bit of a credible story. And the problem with Fallout is that a big part of the story doesn't make any sense, and so it becomes more irritating than entertaining to watch. There are too much twists and turns, but not only are there too much of, but they are also very predictable so there is never really a surprise element.

            "content": "The story in 'Mission: Impossible - Fallout (2018)' is messy, unfocused and, at times, even quite confusing. It isn't bad by any means, however, especially considering production began before a script was even written (just a thirty-three page outline). It does actually manage to pull the wool over your eyes successfully a couple of times, delighting in its ability to play its audience like a fiddle. Essentially, it only really serves as a vehicle for the cast and crew to up the ante in terms of stunt-driven action set-pieces. It provides a phenomenally entertaining, edge-of-your-seat thrill-ride that somehow features the absolute best fights, chases (car, bike, on-foot and otherwise) and sequences of general Tom Cruise craziness of the series, scenes which all also reach perhaps the highest heights in recent cinematic memory. While every prior 'Mission: Impossible' film has raised the bar in terms of action, this one might just have catapulted it into the stratosphere, setting a precedent not just for its own franchise but for its whole genre. The sheer excitement of it all is difficult to express. You'll leave with a genuine buzz, the kind that makes you long to watch it, and even the entire series, immediately all over again. The absolute practicality of the piece really is mind-boggling. It's actually difficult to comprehend, the antidote to the washed-out CGI blockbusters we're battered with too often nowadays. It adds a palpability to the picture that makes every moment entirely believable and utterly compelling. Each dangerous beat is heightened by the fact that our star really is doing the things he claims to do. Really, it's the superb suspense that makes the movie work as well as it does, though. There's always something to care about, even when the plot takes a turn into slightly sourly familiar territory, and it's always in jeopardy, be it from maybe the highest directly villainous stakes of the franchise (which aren't cartoony at all this time) or from the more personal and character-driven emotional ones. This tension is constantly present, making the flick probably the darkest of the lot, but never becomes overwhelming, allowing the brief interjections of levity to do their job all the better. Overall, this is supreme, high-octane entertainment. Not only is it perhaps the best of the series (just about tied with the first and fifth entries, I'd say), it's one of the best action films in the past twenty years. I mean, from a purely action stand-point, it's going to be tough to beat. It isn't often that I wince along with a movie, invested in the literal survival of a character in a set-piece (or ten). That kind of engagement is very rare (helped by the ever-tightening bond between character and actor) and key to the nail-biting, jaw-dropping enjoyment of this fantastic film. 9/10",

The leader of IMF was the guy who put together a team of specialists to perform an impossible mission. There was a cerebral element to the plot.While Ethan (Cruise) has a team here, he is not the leader. He is the stunt executor whose in charge of getting the stuffings knocked out of everyone.\nAlec Baldwin shows up as a sort of pseudo leader but he seems to have some lines that were from rejected Match Game scripts. Then the script has mercy and silences him. His escape works better than the rest of the script.It appears we have the nuke bombs with timers but despite having 3 women, none of them match up with Bond's Octopussy. This film is an action high, but it is not a concept high. It's kind of like giving the IMF force some Crystal Meth and then overdoses of action to boost Ethans ego so he can climb the next rope, stop the next fuse, make scrambled eggs by breaking the shell and throwing away the egg.I like action, and I like comic strips. That does not mean I want them put together without some kind of idea about how they go there. I guess if you like Cruise, you like this saga. Otherwise at almost 3 hours, yawns are in order. It's hard to connect with most of the characters in this, and the situations just seem contrived to make the mission look more impossible. Nothing like destroying the original concept and making the IMF look like any other action film whose leader is the opposite of the original cerebral Barney. Would you believe Ethan is now Barney Fife? Looks like it to me.",

            "content": "I remember not being hyped at all to see this film, and yet it was one of the best cinema experiences I had. Back than I was a MCU Stan. Mission Impossible was a franchise I never really cared for, however three years onwards I can say that it is the best modern action franchise.The action is incredible. This movie alone has better action scenes than all of Daniel Craig's Bond films.However, Fallout isn't the best Mission Impossible movie just because of its action scenes, which are incredible, Fallout excels in it's writing. Christopher Macquarie's and Tom Cruise's acting have crafted the ultimate action hero in MI Fallout. Ethan Hunt completely outclasses James Bond(Daniel Craig's). He feels like a flawed human being trying their best and giving it their all to accomplish the mission. The same can't be said for Bond from Skyfall onwards, who felt like a dull plank pretending to be James Bond.Speaking of Skyfall, one of the most overrated pieces of modern cinema. Fallout doesn't feel the need to hide behind pretentious themes, because the competency of Christopher Macquarie knows that actions speak louder than words. Every action Ethan Hunt takes drives the story forward. He doesn't feel like he has to overcompensate with fancy suits, expensive watches and cool cars. Even though there is an M5 and classic 5 Series. Not an Aston, but still pretty awesome. Hunt is a hero in the actions he takes. The dream sequence and French traffic cop scene highlight why Ethan Hunt outclasses modern Bond. However, the tide can turn if they get the Chad, Henry Cavill, as Bond and also directors and writers who understand actions speak far louder than pretentious themes and nice suits. Cough...Skyfall...cough.Mission Impossible has been a franchise that excels because it doesn't follow the modern Hollywood trends, it sets them. And it sets them very high, to the point of being untouchable.High hopes for MI7.",

            "content": "It's a rarity that a two decade series of spy films somehow becomes more exhilarating with each instalment. But Fallout is not just the best film in the franchise, it's quite possibly one of the best action films of all time. Hunt and the remaining members of IMF must search and obtain stolen plutonium before the nuclear devices utilising them are detonated. Honestly, I am floored. Absolutely flabbergasted. Incredibly astonished. This, technically in terms of an action film, is perfect. A high-stake story that provides suspense and tension through slithering twists that one would hope to find in a spy film. Inducing and personifying a momentous undertone that feels both serious and weighty. Accompanied by McQuarrie's astounding direction that balances humour, character development and action through inventive camera placement. Balfe's hypnotic rendition of the infamous theme tune complementing the chaos shown onscreen. A colourful array of characters where the actors showcase both emotional and physical performances. A flawless three act narrative structure where each consecutive segment increases the heart palpitating pressure even more. But the highlight of this blockbuster, and I'm sure you will agree, are the action sequences. Phenomenal. Just phenomenal. From a one take HALO jump to a motorbike chase through Paris to a rooftop sprint in London ending on a helicopter duel (accompanied with mandatory countdown). Every single action scene was jaw-dropping. The technicality behind each expertly crafted sequence exhumes confidence. Immediately entrancing you into an awe-inspiring world of espionage. Cruise, dedicated as always, does the majority of his stunts. It's safe to assume he would die for this franchise. But he's done it! He has finally made the action film we've always wanted, and should be immensely proud. Energetic, death-defying and relentless. Fallout marks a benchmark in both the franchise and action films. It is the best blockbuster of the year and, without hesitation, gets the perfect rating.",

            "content": "Your mission, should you choose to accept it: Sit back, relax, and watch the new king of action/adventure movie franchises continue on in its greatness.I'd give a basic plot summary of the film, but that's tough for a film like this for a number of reasons. I don't want to give away any spoilers, and the \"plot\" of a MI movie is always going to be more of a conduit to the next action sequence than anything else. Suffice it to say that Ethan Hunt (Tom Cruise) & Co. are once again in top form, combining spy antics, tech gadgets, and high-octane stunts to complete their seemingly impossible tasks.In my review of the previous film, I noted that (at least for me) the MI franchise has now eclipsed Bond in terms of being able to reliably churn out action thrillers. Nothing in \"Fallout\" will dissuade many from that opinion. It crackles from beginning to end with the perfect mix of action, character moments, sex appeal, and even some light-hearted humorous moments. Everything that Bond once was able to accomplish, in other words.Personally, I'll say that this film's predecessor (Rogue Nation) is a tad better overall, for its perfect meld of everything. But this one is close. The major difference is the general move away from spy/tech gadgetry and towards bigger stunt pieces. Whereas it used to be all about the espionage, now it is just as much about \"what mess will Hunt and the gang have to get out of next\".Overall, though, \"Fallout\" is still an excellent film that will keep you entertained from beginning to end. It looks like the type of film that everyone involved in had a blast making, and that goes a long way in how it comes off to viewers.",

But that's okay because the film is still great and is probably now my second favourite M:I film behind M:I 4 - Ghost Protocol by Brad Burt, which is my favourite action film of 2011, which is then behind Mission Impossible 1 followed by M:1 2. I still haven't seen Mission Impossible III, but it can't be any better than Mission: Impossible 2 which was still a really good action film in the end. \nAnywaym M:16 is still my favourite action film of the year that has gone leaps ahead from it's predecessors always trying to be more entertaining than the last, in which this one succeded. Tom Cruise is always pushing himself as an actor and his own personal stuntman to electrify the audience no matter what the cost. I thought it was impossible to top climbing up the side of Burj Khalifa but he managed to do it by training himself to fly a helicopter through a canyon sequence which took over 2 years to complete. The plot is more powerful than ever when a religious warhead threatens to blow up three of the holiest sites in the world with three nuclear shotput balls in where it is up to Ethan Hunt and his team to track him down and stop him and the bombs from going off before it's too late, even if it caused him to question his morals along the way.\nMission Impossible 6 gives you everything you want from a Mission Impossible and Tom Cruise action movie. It has the incredible action and fighting sequences, the nailbiting infiltration scene, the very complex and hard to follow plot and Tom Cruise's incredible stuntwork dedication and stamina. I just wish it didn't look so visually dark. But apart from that, it's the best action film of the year and you should definitely see it.",

This latest version of Mission Impossible resembles some of the last Roger Moore's depiction as James Bond. And in some ways, this movie script might have been better served with Daniel Craig's character as James Bond. The action and humor sequences have almost become parodies of themselves. The movie plot is also so manipulated with fantastical unlikely coincidental events that the plot becomes an obvious stitched together strands of action shots put together along with the requisite death of an important character and the attempts at serious human emotional bonding that have been much better portrayed elsewhere, that even being on television. See Person of Interest (2011-2016) series with Jim Caviezel. Even Hitman: Agent 47 (2015) had an even more convincing and necessarily even tighter, explosive beginning action sequence. Knowing this is a Mission Impossible movie, the predictable twist in the first half of the movie seems lame. The bad guys seem too obvious too.

Tom Cruise, with his enchanted silky hairdo, was ascending a hillside in what I can assume was Grand Canyon with this amazing background score to complement the aesthetics of that scene. I was in love with this movie there and then. After that, it was an upward trajectory. MI:3, Ghost protocol, Rogue Nation and now Fallout. It's turning out to be the one and only thing Tom Cruise is doing right (The disastrous Mummy is in my mind) and even Paramount for that matter.I look for class and sophistication when I go see an MI. My expectations have been sky-high since Rogue Nation. Be it Rebecca Ferguson's charismatic character or the well-choreographed hand-to-hand combat during the climax. Christopher McQuarrie demonstrated that he can easily fill the shoes of Brad Bird. So, before even watching the trailer for Fallout, I was skeptical. The question was, what more can they do? Where else can they take the movie? The answer is, nothing seems to be impossible for McQuarrie and his brigade.Fallout is visually stunning, jam-packed with artistic action sequences and is tremendously entertaining. Its best characteristic is the angle of morality they brought in Cruise's character. The movie asks whether its justified that Hunt occasionally risks the lives of millions to save those few he loves. As we go, the question is answered in the most MI way - Hunt can make anything possible. The movie is so judiciously written, some of the scenes are illustrative representations of the phrase poetic justice. The supporting characters hold much importance as compared to preceding instalments in the franchise. Also, we get the cameo which we all expected, Michelle Monaghan's Julia - the one constant in Hunt's life. The music is on point. I like the way they keep the thematic tune almost same in all the movies with a little tweak here and there to make it refreshing but also nostalgic.But for me, the real hero here is McQuarrie. Even the most trivial scenes are shot with perfection. They've gone lengths to make sure that the audience knows that Cruise did these stunts, some of which are so innovative that you'll want to jump from your seats out of sheer exhilaration.\nAlmost everything works for this movie. The series is making its mark as one of the most reliable franchise, at par with Marvel and Disney movies. So, for those who want to watch something decent and something other than a superhero flick, this movie is for you.A note to MI fans, it feels like a chapter of Hunt's life is closing and another is opening. Thus, in this film you'll find a number of instances when former MIs are referenced. It is highly likely that you guys will love this movie even more so. So, go check it out in your nearest theatre as soon as you can.",

Actiony and explosive parade of badassdom with superb direction, suspense and not without a sense of humor when it needs it.

            "content": "Hail to the return of the death-defying IMF (Impossible Missions Force) agent Ethan Hunt, and its ageism-defying star Tom Cruise in the sixth installment of this surprisingly long-running franchise, FALLOUT follows the aftermath of ROGUE NATION, both directed by Christopher McQuarrie, when three table-top plutonium cores are fallen into the evil hands of a terrorist group called the Apostles, reorganized by the remnants the Syndicate after their head Solomon Lane (Harris) is apprehended in the end of the fifth chapter, naturally, Hunt and co. must take it on to themselves to face their old nemesis and a mole shadowing Hunt at close range.The plot is customarily self-complicated and elliptical in elucidating the cloak-and-dagger development, for one thing, it is rather elusive about how and when Lane and his mustachioed accomplice lay their hands on the plutonium cores, or does Lane have a death wish to stay behind when the nuclear bombs are activated? Reading its synopsis on Wikipedia doesn't help, a compulsive second viewing? nice try! That said, FALLOUT unequivocally denotes the highest standard of the spy genre filmmaking, opposite to the limitless boundary of superhero fantasies, as the franchise has been pushing the envelope ever since its genesis. Here, starting with the much plugged HALO (High Altitude Low Opening) stunt performed by Cruise and the new recruit, Henry Cavill, man of steel himself (visibly relishes his not-so-well-kept villainous about-face and is equally mettlesome in tackling high-wire stunt work), FALLOUT cleverly downplays gizmo novelty and instead regales audience with invigorating physical fisticuffs, vehicle barreling thrills and chills, unthinkable airborne jeopardy and of course, Ethan running and leaping from building to building, a l\u00e0 James Bond, only more relentless and awe-inspiring. Indeed, FALLOUT does set up a formidable exemplar for the upcoming Bond 25, and throws down the heavy gauntlet to Daniel Craig, 6 years junior to Mr. Cruise, how can you top that Mr. Bond? Nevertheless, if MISSION: IMPOSSIBLE intends to elongate this money spinner's life span like its more esteemed British counterpart, there is a catch, because up to this point, the franchise categorically lives and dies with Cruise, whose star charisma and undimmed spirit is audience's main attraction and to achieve that, no matter how much materialistic incentive is behind the motive, is a miracle per se in this day and age. Also notably, McQuarrie wisely amps up Ethan's own characterization arc, as if for the first time, a viewer can limpidly see through him among those action-packed commotions, saliently, sacrificing innocent individual for the greater good is not above him, and he does care for his teammates and those who are close to him, tries his best to keep them out of harm's way, an unpremeditated reconnection with ex-wife Julia (Monaghan) transpires harmoniously in tandem with the tacit rapport between Ethan and fellow ass-kicker agent Ilsa Faust (Ferguson, slightly underutilized here than her jaw-dropping entrance in ROGUE NATION), there is chemistry flickering, but both dare not to make it personal, a love triangle seems to be in the pipeline and both women are sensible enough to detect that in their casual interaction, oops, the plot thickens... and needless to say we will pony up for the next adventure when it comes, as long as Ethan and his team can continue upping the ante.",

            "content": "\"Mission Impossible: Fallout\"\nor \"My heart rate monitor thinks I'm running...\"Genre: Action/Thriller\nIn this the sixth installment of the franchise, I was just going to buy it when it came out to video. There were just too many movies that I wanted to see in the theater and I was going to get it anyway...then I read all the reviews and heard people talking about it. Oh ok twist my arm...so I went to see it. Man was it intense! My daughter said it was too stressful for her...that's just my game. You want to give me an action movie that has me white knuckling it...I'm your huckleberry! Let's saddle up for the O.K. Corral in true Lowedown fashion and break this movie down.\nCast=10\nMost of the cast returns for Fallout, so it's a great ensemble. We unfortunately lose Jeremy Renner but we gain Henry Cavill. That's like going from Hawkeye to Superman in one shot...oh wait, that's exactly what happened! Add in Angela Bassett and a few others and I have to give the full ten points.\nActing=8\nThere are some great actors in the bunch...Simon Pegg and Michelle Monaghan stood out for me. It was great to see Monaghan with a larger role in the franchise, where we usually get a cameo. If the acting is to get ten points, then that means an Oscar-worthy performance. It wasn't quite that good, but it was solid...eight points for Hufflepuff.\nPlot=9\nEthan Hunt and his IMF team face what's left of the Syndicate....a group calling themselves the Apostles. When a mission to retrieve nuclear cores fails, the team must race against the clock to stop the Apostles and their new leader...John Lark. I can't give it full points...it's a great plot but has been done before. Nine points for the IMF to help them win.\nEnding=10\nWhat a nail-biter...wow! This was where I had to take an extra blood pressure pill, as a lot of stuff was happening at the same time in different spots. There just seemed to be a level of intensity that I do not remember having from the previous films. Think of it like taking a Red Bull and pouring two of those five hour energy shots...I was wound up like a seven day clock. Ten points for the good guys!\nStory=9\nI really liked how the story played out...the intensity was a given, but there was very little lag during the film. With always something to pay attention to, it makes for a great movie. The only thing that bugged me is with all the MI, even though it looks like they messed up everything went according to plan. I didn't get that here...it really made like they messed up. Nine points to the score.Favorite Quote: \"There cannot be peace without first a great suffering. The greater the suffering, the greater the peace.\"\nGenre: Action\nViolent=10\nOh yeah...it's violent! Explosions, car chases, fights in the bathroom...you name it and they did it. I like that Tom Cruise does a lot of his own stunts. He even broke his foot jumping from one building to another. All in all, I was very pleased with the violence and award ten magical points for that violence.\nPace=9\nThere is always something going on...even when they are planning an attack there was intensity. \"You use a scalpel, I prefer a hammer.\" My heart rate was on a roller coaster...just as I started to calm down a bit, the action amped up. It was like they did it on purpose...I'll give them a nine and a big thank you for the interval training. Calories burned during the movie: 107\nF/X=10\nThe explosions...the stunts...the whole thing was just EPIC! There was a lot of green screen stuff, but not as much CGI as you would think considering what they did. I really admire that in an action film; which is why I score for effects as a whole and not CGI (see Infinity War). Ten points awarded for this film...it's a dream for the action junkie.Sub-Genre: Thriller\nIntense=10\nWhat makes a thriller is how intense it is. You have be on the edge of your seat in breathless anticipation...just waiting for something to happen. That intensity was in so many places that even my daughter had a problem with it. I can't help but give this film ten points.\nFate whispers to the warrior.\nThere's a storm coming.\nAnd the warrior whispers back.\nI am the storm.\nTwist=7\nThere is a solid twist...that is something that gives a Thriller such a good ending (he was a ghost all along!!). Unfortunately, I saw the twist coming pretty early. That's ok, though...the ending was still great and the twist was a factor of that ending. I will have to give this film seven points for a good but predictable twist.\nMy Score: 9.2\nYour mission, should you choose to accept it, is to go see this movie. If you decide to wait for the video release, it is well worth a watch for any action junkie. I know some people do not care for Tom Cruise, but I can't help but praise his work ethic and the quality of his movies. Just do what 'ol Jack Burton does at a time like this...look that big storm right in the eye and say, \"Give me your best shot pal...I can take it!\"",

Alec Baldwin is back as Sec.-Def Hunley; as are Ving Rhames and Simon Pegg (as Ethan's IMF partners); Rebecca Ferguson (reprising Ilsa from \"MI:Rogue Nation\"); Sean Harris (reprising Solomon Lane, also from MIRN); and Michelle Monaghan as Dr. Julia Meade (Ethan's ex-wife from \"MI: Three\").  Then, there are relative newcomers, to the franchise, Henry Cavill and Angela Bassett (who might or might not be rogue double-agents called \"Apostles\"). At nearly two hours and forty-five minutes long, this is the most knuckle-whitening sequel, yet. There's a lot of stunt work by Tom Cruise as Ethan; increased sexual tension between him and his female acquaintances (including a profiteering minx called \"The White Widow\" and a very sultry French police agent who goes by the initials \"A.J.\"); the requisite number of plot twists provided by those awesome rubber face masks; and even some comedy relief worthy of the Indiana Jones films! In fact, there's so much packed into this particular sequel, that I have to ask: could Cruise be thinking of ending the franchise, here, while it's still popular? Because, frankly, I don't know how another MI sequel could possibly top this one! But, if Cruise wants to try, I'll go see it with just as much non-hesitation as I did this one. The rest of you should be just as unhesitant.",

            "content": "With \"Mission: Impossible - Fallout,\" McQuarrie is determined to show his work, creating an extended climax that will likely blow audiences away. The rest of the movie isn't bad either, with Tom Cruise and the IMF unit continuing their impressive cinematic hustle for a new adventure that's the most bruising to date, and the most cohesive in years.Forced to choose between protecting partner Luther (Ving Rhames) and protecting the world, Ethan (Tom Cruise) makes a decision that loses control of a three plutonium orbs, allowing them to reach the black market. Eager to correct the situation, Ethan wants to pursue the plutonium to France, but the CIA is keen to keep an eye on him, putting August (Henry Cavill), a top enforcer, into play, joining Benji (Simon Pegg) as the race begins to charm arms dealer White Widow (Vanessa Kirby) into giving up the goods. In league with a terrorist group known as The Apostles, White Widow requires delivery of imprisoned anarchist Solomon (Sean Harris) to make a deal, forcing Ethan to confront his sense of moral duty as he plans to relinquish control of his archenemy to maintain world order. Standing in his way is Ilsa (Rebecca Ferguson), with the MI6 agent also concerned about Solomon's status, mixing it up with the IMF as they try to prevent the creation of three nuclear devices in control of a man who's looking to redefine world order.\"Rogue Nation\" opened in a huge way, with Ethan sprinting into action as the IMF gang infiltrated an airfield, trying to prevent an Airbus A400M from taking off. Of course, this left the leader hanging on the side of an ascending airplane, with Cruise pulling off an amazing stunt for an eye-popping introduction, maintaining his reputation as an actor who embraces danger to create frightening thrills for his \"Mission: Impossible\" series. \"Fallout\" doesn't attempt the same scale, keeping things low-key as McQuarrie examines the extremes of Ethan's responsibilities, fighting to balance the protection of his squad and the preservation of life on Earth, facing The Apostles, a collection of well-trained mercenaries who are determined to use the plutonium orbs to generate mass destruction, inspiring change through catastrophe, feeding their religion of chaos, celebrating Solomon, their god. \"Fallout\" doesn't mess with bigness for quite some time, finding McQuarrie more invested in a spy game this time around, giving weight to Ethan's work as a superhero for the cause, caught between his need to protect the individual and pledge to save the world.\"Fallout\" takes some time to get up and running, but it showcases a more confident McQuarrie, who struggled with balancing the enormity of \"Rogue Nation\" with its primary hunt, resulting in a dazzling but lopsided film. The next chapter in the \"Mission: Impossible\" saga is more confident and fully realized, finding McQuarrie trying to work up a sophisticated scenario of threat for the IMF gang to untangle, but also stepping carefully to keep the audience invested, stopping the feature on occasion to underline exposition and clarify character connections. McQuarrie also tries to slip in a few twists and turns along the way, but his puzzling isn't advanced, with eagle-eyed viewers likely realizing the full reach of The Apostles before Ethan does. Still, the director seems newly energized to make his mark on the \"Mission: Impossible\" world, making a direct sequel to \"Rogue Nation\" that keeps Solomon in play, with the anarchist delighting in any chance he receives to keep his appointment with doomsday, determined to watch Ethan suffer for his failures.\"Fallout\" is a sleeker production, utilizing stunning cinematography and a driving score to slowly increase pressure, while the screenplay does a fine job with escalation, gradually increasing the urgency of the mission as it visits a few countries, selling the globetrotting atmosphere of the franchise. The film's centrepiece action sequence takes place on the streets of Paris, with Ethan, playing the part of a terrorist, tries to locate and reacquire Solomon for bargaining purposes, speeding, sprinting, and leaping all over the city while McQuarrie feels out his \"French Connection\" fandom. There's also a memorable fight inside a nightclub bathroom -- a scene that makes the most of Cavill's August, who's positioned as a major complication in the story, but never quite settles anywhere interesting. He's better with blunt power, and \"Fallout\" has its share of violent encounters and massive sequel moments, but McQuarrie doesn't get carried away. The human element of Ethan's world remains, dealing with the seductive qualities of the White Widow and his unease around Ilsa as she figures out what team she's playing for.\"Fallout\" is appealingly performed by most of the cast with Cruise his most battered and bewildered here, still giving the role everything he's got, which remains a quite a lot, even 22 years after he took command of the franchise. McQuarrie is also newly inspired, trying to make up for the limp of \"Rogue Nation\" by creating a powerful showdown finale that's timed with a ticking clock and features battling helicopters in the middle of Kashmir. It's a vertigo-inducing doozy, and a helluva way to bring the movie to a close, offering pure nail-biting spectacle that also acts as an apology in a way, with McQuarrie making sure ticket-buyers exit with their bells rung. Directors don't have a habit of sticking around the \"Mission: Impossible\" franchise for very long, but it would be something to see McQuarrie return to duty for a third picture, just for the chance to watch him try to top his work in \"Fallout.\" That's going to be the real mission: impossible.",

            "content": "This movie was awesome! It's everything great about the previous MI movies and more. Christopher McQuarrie provides arguably the most well written mission impossible yet. This movie has heart, humor, a surprisingly dense and complex story and of course, the edge-of-your-seat action this franchise is known for. Ethan Hunt is tasked with tracking down missing plutonium after a failed mission in Berlin. The Syndicate has been mostly destroyed but those who survive call themselves the Apostles. The plot isn't easy to lay out without spoiling the movie, which brings me to my first praise for this film. The story. Ever since the first MI film, the stories have gotten less complex. Until this one. With twists and turns, and welcome surprises, this movie subverts expectations very well. The story is filled with double crosses and some well-written dialogue for an action heavy movie.The second praise is the action. I mean come on. Some of the stunts may seem familiar (motorcycle chases, hanging from aircraft) but they are executed in a such a way that it feels fresh. For a movie with this kind of run time, the story never drags thanks to set piece after set piece. There are some truly thrilling moments and it is by far the most intense MI yet. Third praise is the characters. While obviously it's the Ethan Hunt show, I feel like the other characters were well used. Cavill was great as was Ferguson. I just love Sean Harris though. His voice is so calm yet menacing at the same time. The best part about the characters is that they can be unpredictable. Throughout the whole movie you can't really tell what side people are on or what they'll do next. It adds intrigue to what could have been a by the books action movie.Fourth praise is the subtle nods to the older movies. This movie also points out its on absurdity at times in very funny ways. Most of the complaints I've seen is that this movie is too improbable. But to all of you people this movie is called mission impossible. What do you expect? The movie even recognizes that. The only negative I had was that this like most other MI movies has a large plot macguffin. It would be cool to see if there could be a MI without some nuclear weapon being the driving force of the movie. Last praise, to the king of action, Tom Cruise! This guy must just push his body to the limit every day. I mean the stuff he pulls in this movie is crazy. For a man in his late 50s he is unbelievable. He may be kind of nut, but you have to respect this mans abilties and sheer balls to pull these stunts off. I have mad respect for the guy. Absolutely the must see movie of the summer and probably in the top 3 movies of 2018 along with Infiniti War and A Quiet Place",

This movie got me thinking all 2 hours how would it develop, but I never got it right, this takes you in a roller coaster of emotions and action that you will really really get out of the Theater with a smile. Most people hate Tom Cruise because of his religion, in fact Hollywood hates him (we only see him in movies he produce, no other studie hires him), but you gotta admit, Tom Cruise is the best actor you will ever see in a film. I really don't know if the serie must go on, because this movie is so perfect!! Is the ultimate jewl of the crown, I am afraid a 7th movie won't be as good as this one, because this Fallout is just unsurpassable. This movie opens so many doors, but I don't know if the franchise should choose one at all. I didn't believe the news when reported this movie as best action film of all times, but now I know, it truly is. I seriously doubt we would see any other movie like this, ever. Finally, to fully enjoy this movie, I strongly recommend to watch the #5 film first, which is not as good as this one, but gives you background. Don't listen to haters, I guarantee, you will love this movie, won't lose your time, but earn a smile and a big feeling of satisfaction.",

I loved Rogue Nation (or to be frank the character of Ilsa Faust played by Rebecca Ferguson). But she wasn't allowed to shine in this film. She had more agency in RN, in this she's just the woman action heroin.This had none of the drama and intesinty of Rogue Nation. It was essentially one action scene after the other. The plot was paper thin, and the motivation of the villain was laughable. Henry Cavill as Walker was just obnoxious. An American meathead. And Angela Bassette' s actions really served no purpose.I was also very irritated at the resolution of the marriage. I had been under the impression that Hunt lived with his wife in secret to protect her, and it was an important aspect of who he was and it kept him anchored. It just seemed that the kiboshed the marriage so that they could make Faust his love interest. It was just forced and contrived.The only thing I liked about the film was Hunt's willing not to sacrifice even one innocent life. And the cinematography. The film is a great advertisement for visiting Paris and London.\nTo be frank near 75% part of the film, I was just tempted to walk out and read the plot resolution online.",

            "review_title": "Competing for most fun of 2018!",
            "content": "I'll say it up front: This probably tops any previous outing in the globetrotting franchise for its ridiculousness! It's totally stupid! If you ever disliked how previous instalments, or indeed any previous Tom Cruise action film, asked you to suspend your disbelief quite as much as they did, then this one will have you utterly incredulous! But, if it's not completely bonkers, are you really watching a 'Mission: Impossible'? With the return of Christopher McQuarrie to the helm, we have, arguably, the most enjoyable instalment, and for me, perhaps the most exciting action film since 'The Raid 2'. Indeed, it seems that this team of Cruise and McQuarrie are the perfect pairing for the franchise. At this stage, with a sixth film released, it is truly a pleasant surprise to be able to say it doesn't feel tired, and that, despite being a tad heavy on the plot exposition, it remains a joy due to wall-to-wall, jaw-dropping stunt work, chase sequences that echo classics from 'The French Connection' and Nolan's 'Batman' series, more than a smattering of on-point charm, and stunning location shooting. Even in spite of the inner voice that says they really should stop now, you can't help but smile ear-to-ear for the entirity of its mammoth runtime. Doing a lot of the heavy lifting is the team themselves: Rebeccara Ferguson, Simon Pegg, Tom and Ving Rhames, as well as the boss, Alec Baldwin, remain as likeable as ever (an area in which the franchise has steadily improved), with that now familiar sense of camaraderie that proves so important to the success of these movies. Despite all the explosions, chases, and fights that threaten to test the patience, the fact is that you believe in and care about these people, and so find yourself well on board. Of course, fresh meat is always nice, and this film's addition of Henry Cavill as a strangely mustachioed good bad guy (bad good guy?) makes for a couple of fun gags. Personally, I remain unsold on the man as an actor, but he carries a lot of physical heft needed for some of this stuff to work.And the action? Well, relentless might be a word for it, and in less talented hands it would definitely be too much, but McQuarrie understands the importance of the audience's empathy and smarts (Remember, this is is the writer responsible for 'The Usual Suspects'), so there is never a sense that he is being distracted; every action sequence pushes us forward and usually gives us something more to chew on, as well as being sheer entertainment. This goes a long way. Whether it be the best car chase I've witness on the big screen for years, not one but two of the best aerial set-pieces since 'The Dark Knight Rises', or the most surprisingly crushing fight sequence since the aforementioned 'The Raid 2', you never lose sight of why it's happening or what's at stake. A new paragraph...just for the running! Yes, there is a lot of it, and that's the point. Trust me, in time, the extended sequence of Tom Cruise running around London's rooftops and bridges will be a staple-point in cinema. It may not carry the same ground-breaking weight as Gene Hackman driving after a train at full speed, but it is very similar to that scene in spirit, and carries in its DNA the same sense of gritted determination (As with Hackman's Doyle, you really are rooting for Ethan all the way!). It uses smart editing from other points of view to provide a sense of how he is faring moment to moment, drawing us in to the chase, and it shows off a post-millennium London in beautiful, proud glory, so as to make for a classic moment in film history - Guaranteed! So, a bit too much explaining of things? Yes. A bit too long? Probably. A heap of reasonably intelligent fun at the movies? Very much so! Probably the most fun you'll have with an action movie in 2018, in fact. And is it the end? It's tough to say, but if McQuarrie sticks around, and Tom doesn't DIE during shooting (Remember, nearly everything you see him doing, he is actually doing!), I wouldn't be against a finale to what would effectively be a trilogy from this team.",

Arms dealer John Lark and a group of terrorists known as the Apostles plan to use plutonium cores for a nuclear attack. When the cores go missing, Ethan and his team find themselves in a desperate race against time to prevent them from falling into the wrong hands.....Even though it's said whenever a movie from this franchise is released (maybe not MI:2), this really is the best MI thus far. And its not just because of the pretty amazing narrative, or some of the best set pieces in any action film for a long time, it's down to the man himself, Tom Cruise.As usual, he's also producer, does his own stunts, and does his obligatory running sequence, but during production, and throughout the film, it feels like he's trying to prove something. maybe it's to show the world that he still has his star power, or showing that he can do all this at his age, but whatever he's doing, he's done it right.Right from the get go, the film doesn't let up, and the sinister tension of being vulnerable and wanted is rife throughout the film, and gives it a strange sense of it feeling like a conspiracy film from the seventies.Cruise is amazing, and this proves that he is the main man in Hollywood, and little blips like The Mummy, will never taint his stardom. And it's good to see the rest of the cast being a little more fleshed out than previous outings, just having them share a little banter with Cruise to gather a few laughs. Pegg in particular, has a much more bigger role in this, and he's as perfect as ever.Even though the film is quite dark in places, there are still plenty of laughs to be had, especially when Hunt is chasing Walker in London.And Cavill, what a part he plays. After you get over the fact he is wearing the most expensive moustache in movie history. He's almost autonomous like in his role, and is a great addition to the film.My only gripe is that the main plot arc is given away to easy, especially when you consider that there is a double cross in the second act that just threw me into a state of awe for the writing.It does reference the other films a lot, the opening scene reminded me of the first film, and kind of gave that away, but other than these minor gripes, it's one of the most intelligent summer films to be released in a while.With other MI films, there was always a media sensation when it came to Cruise doing a 'big stunt'. And the reason why the media coverage on this was basically an ankle injury, it's because every single set piece in this usurps anything from previous films. From the HALO jump, to the amazing chase scene in France (that reminded me of The French Connection), to the breathtaking final act, Cruise has done the impossible, he's made the film of the summer, and the best of the franchise.A must see.",

            "content": "Fallout is a mixed bag. While it excels in action and stunts, it fails to deliver a cogent story. I'll start with the positive sides first. The action scenes and stunts are top notch and arguably set the standards for Bond and MI sequels. As most people already put it, the washroom fight scenes feel so real you almost hear cracking bones with each kick and punch. The rooftop stunts pulled by Cruise himself, car and motorcycle chases in Paris streets are shot very realistically. The accompanying cinematography including narrow, cobblestone Paris alleys and a mishmash of a rocky landscape from Kashmir and Norway fjords are breathtaking. The acting is pretty good, too.On the flipside, the plot is so intertwined and flimsy that it eventually loses its coherence. For example, Lark is a member of Apostles who stole Plutonium cores from Ethan in Berlin but then Lark tries to get them from Apostles through a blackmarket arms dealer. Does that ever make sense? Well, according to the screenplay writers it does, because this convoluted mess of a plot is all about framing Ethan as a nuclear terrorist. Why they'd go to such lengths as they could easily put down Ethan in Berlin or any other place when Lark and Ethan were together is a mystery. Apparently, Lark and Lane set themselves on a mission of nuking freshwater resource for over a billion people for greater good (!) of the humanity. As Lark and Apostles have all the opportunity, tools and means to perform this \"holy\" task, Lark's entanglement of himself and all his gang members in a such mess for something as mundane and trivial as framing Ethan as a terrorist weakens the story.What makes things worse is the pace of the movie which runs too fast to follow all the twists. It would be much better and wiser to intersperse some subplots to let the audience digest the unfolding scenario and regain their breath for the following action. Especially with Baldwin's character, there appear some sporadic moments to explain the convoluted scenario but that doesn't come enough. The only breath catching subplot happens with the Kashmir reunion but it is far too late and feeble. Indeed, the sappy meeting with Michelle Monaghan in Kashmir adds nothing to the story but more minutes to the already stretched-out playtime, serving for no apparent purpose than including her in the cast.While other movies are mercilessly criticized for their plotholes and unrealistic story lines, MI series usually get a carte blanche in their starry-eyed stunts like physical impersonations with Benji disguising as Lane, etc. As much as the action scenes in Kashmir are shot very well, we see a series of impossible events happening in 15 min which in reality can hardly be accomplished in a week (like detecting and defusing two nuclear bombs by using a screwdriver and a pair of pliers) I'm not even going to mention how much time it would take to climb up a 50 ft long rope hanging from a chopper twice as it's flying over 150 mph.In short, this is a movie where good action scenes and spectacular stunts are counterbalanced by its unnecessarily convoluted plot and pedestrian screenwriting.",

The improbable (dare I say impossible?) sequence with the fifteen minute countdown seemed to last a half hour at least.

It's a summer blockbuster that filmgoers lapped up like ice cream, and it's entertaining enough as it trots out all the usual tropes.

            "content": "The Mission franchise is an interesting one. It's spanned over 20 years, has only had two actors appear in every film, has never fully embraced continuity, and has undoubtedly gone through many production issues. Alas, it's also one of the greatest franchises because it has defied what it means to impress audience with action and it keeps getting better and better with every film. Although admittedly, I'm not exactly sure how it can get any better from here. I saw this movie early, and instantly felt it was one of the best action movies of all time, but I also knew I needed to see it at least one more time before I really did give it that title. Well, I've seen the film 4 times now and each time further cemented my feelings. Everything from the Halo jump, to the middle act (which is essentially one long chase sequence), to the callbacks, to the Helicopter scene, to Henry Cavill's unnecessary but totally bada** facial hair. Mission: Impossible Fallout is an unbelievable ride that simply never lets up. Even in its quiet moments, it has touching dialogue that makes the action more weighted. Even in my 4 viewings, I've never been bored, and I can't wait to see it again. It also surprisingly had a great amount of emotional stakes, something the serious didn't really have since Mission 3. There are a few moments with Ving Rhames, Rebecca Ferguson, and Michelle Monaghan that really hit me emotionally, and I never would have expected that from this series. It has the best antagonist(s) since Phillip Seymour Hoffman, and maybe even better, the action is easily the most impressive in years (probably since Fury Road), and the actors have never been better. If there's going to be another one, then take your time and do it right, because this could very well be the best conclusion possible for the series. Thank you to Tom Cruise and Christopher McQuarrie for making this an instant classic. 10/10",

            "content": "PROS:ACTION SEQUENCES O.K - but completely diminished by the fact that you KNOW none of the characters are ever REALLY in danger. Remember the first movie when they were actually scared for their lives alll the time, well not anymore - they're basically super heroes who dodge EVERY bullet and jump out of EVERY two story building and just brush it off. Hollywood knows that this is TRASH and that only the DUMBEST of audiences will continue to suspend disbelief.ALSO Con, the PATHETIC product placement by BMW and LAND ROVER. Its just so obvious it hurts - thereby distracting from the movie. On multiple occasions the cars are literally waiting to be hopped in and lined up as if in a show room. its just so sad, how about showing the cars getting used properly and the characters having fun in them.\nFirst we get a new BMW then we get a mix of Range rovers the baddies get around in, then we get an OLD and (INVINCIBLE) BMW that gets shot / crashes multiple times but just keeps going of course - unlike any new BMW . LOL . THEN for the cherry on the product placement cake we get an OLD LAND ROVER later in the movie.... wtf... it probably broke down 200 times while filming.ALSO ALL car scenes were aimed at the LOWEST possible common denominator - NO pedestrians for multiple minutes of the movies motorcycle scenes - racing along sidewalks (IN PARIS) at 100mph ... ok ... sure wake me up when its over because thats dumb.CONS:THE STORY .they Bring back grumpy BORING Villain from last film ( LAZY ) , create some UNBELIEVABLE life or death tension between characters who are meant to be ON THE SAME TEAM. Cause severe audience confusion by attempting to create multiple plot lines that stop as soon as they're started - force in a romantic story arcs that have NO substance in case you offend someone for a kiss scene ... oooooh noooo can't do that but we can show multiple police officers getting murdered in a tunnel. There's something very wrong with current US censorship when abhorrent violence gets into PG-13 but a KISS between the main characters - who are in love - is NOOOOT allowed.THE HELICOPTER SCENE,Whoever came up with the idea to have two helo's chasing each other - pat on back, whoever executed the filming / plot points, go back to school.I understand creative licence in a film and the need to apply it occasionally, however when a chopper gets shot in the engine ( this chopper only has one ) and your entire warning display shows in RED then its going down sooner than later. However here we see nearly INVINCIBLE choppers racing each other to the bottom (literally) of an action sequence that should have been much more creative and believable, Hunt finally crashes his chopper into the SPINNING rear tail rotor of the one in front - but doesn't even get a scratch. The choppers both crash but their airframes are like solid METAL spheres bouncing along the mountain like balls. - I'm sure everyone is well aware that choppers are NOT strong, they are as light as possible and squish without hesitation.NO real spoilers, but the ENDINGSo the bombs are meant to be undefusable, simon peg says so for like a whole minute - so it MUST be, then 5 mins later he announces that HE CAN defuse them ..yah horruh we as an audience were ALMOST subject to some sense of danger. nope not anymore. so we KNOW the bombs will be defused before the bomb defusal scene even STARTS! this is a failure of movie making 101.Then the cherry on top is that the movie outright FAKES a nuclear explosion with a cut to a white screen for 3 seconds and a very very very bright sunrise that tom cruise is looking at for no apparent reason other to make it seem like he's looking at a NUCLEAR bomb going off. and for a brief second i thought wow - a redeeming factor, those characters will have to be replaced for the next mission - good, we need some fresh faces. but NO we were simply lied to and the rest of the movie was so predictable you might as well walk out early, the whole get together in a nice place - whoo that was a tough one... again .... yeah we just saved a remote medical camp in the middle of nowhere, well pats on backs everyone. Also the main villain wanting to stay and die, C'MON!, really, with no reason but that he says he's sick of being chased - WHATEVER!. ITS A TRASH BRAIN-DEAD MOVIE that SHOULD HAVE BEEN MADE VERY DIFFERENTLY> Over and out.",

            "content": "I remember watching the first 'Mission Impossible' film back in the mid-nineties. No, I won't claim to understand every single plot point in the film, but when the stunts were so high-octane, I simply put it down to some evil supervillain trying to take over the world somehow and a pumped-up Tom Cruise and co out to stop them.Now I'm older (and so is Tom Cruise, although he seems to be aging a damn sight better than me!) and therefore I should be able to get my head round the (only slightly less complicated!) plots. Sadly, I can't. Besides the fact that there's another supervillain (or society - the 'MI' films tend to alternate between the two threats) threatening the world with another menace (this time the 'tried and tested' trope of 'stolen nukes') and so Tom and co must spring into action.Yes, there's more to it than that. It is - after all - a 'spy movie' therefore you have to expect all the clich\u00e9s that come with the genre. You have the Government officials who want to shut down Tom's team, some doublecrosses thrown in here and there and all the obvious action. And, yes, there's plenty of action.Tom Cruise makes it well-known that he does all his own (or is it at least 'most?') of his stunts and there are some pretty impressive ones here. If you believe the online trivia for this film, he had to train for a year to do one such action set-piece. There's also a pretty high-octane motorbike chase through the streets of Paris. However, despite saying that Cruise does most of his stunts, I couldn't help but feel that some of the shots looked a little 'CGI' (feel free to correct me if you can find proof otherwise).Although 'Fallout' is - as usual - Tom Cruise's 'baby' and, seeing as the entire franchise has lay heavily on his megastar shoulders, this one is no different. But, as is now common in the series, familiar faces such as Simon Pegg and Ving Rhames are also on board in order to lend a hand where necessary. The real newcomer to the show is none other than 'Superman' himself, Henry Cavill, who can certainly rival Cruise when it comes to kicking people's heads in and I think he's a welcome addition to the film and adds something that the previous instalments haven't had.Basically, if you like the recent 'MI' films (at least from 'Part III' onwards) then you'll like this. If you're a fan of either Cruise or Cavill then it's definitely worth a watch. In a world where action films are 'uber-serious' and everything is highly realistic, it's nice to see one that's totally over-the-top in terms of its stunts, action and - of course - those 'perfect fit' full face masks guaranteed to fool any baddie they need to. It's a great popcorn movie where you don't really need to understand every last betrayal to have fun.",

            "content": "By their own efforts, force-sensitive scavenging Jedis; vengeful ladies with psychokinetic skills and enhanced mental abilities or lethal combat prowess from ancient Chinese martial arts; drivers with good values ready for any racing madness involving high speed; young people experiencing memory or hearing problems thirsty for the adrenaline of a car, a motorbike, a yacht or a punch; supermen, superwomen, villains and anti-heroes who fight for stability defending their beliefs about peace, truth, love, hope, justice, \"law\" and chaos staunchly; top-secret agents/spies wearing elegant attire that, most of the time, emerge victorious from their missions; retired assassins who forcibly return to 'the Continental Hotel' by a puppy incident and characters and/or animated heroes who save continents, countries, cities, friends and families deserve their due respect and recognition both in the industry and in the history of film. However, suddenly, the sassy boldness and unstoppable charm of the IMF agent who leads, legally or illegally, impossible agency missions have helped to shape one of the best action/adventure films of the 21st century and, sans nul doute, the best actioner since George Miller's 2015 multi-Oscar-winning post-apocalyptic masterpiece. Hence, critics, cinephiles and moviegoers alike are greeting it with raves, comparing the latest and most barbaric adventure of Hunt and his team - save William Brandt played by Jeremy Renner, who was committed heart and soul to Marvel Studios - to modern-classic \"Mad Max: Fury Road\" for its mastery assembling and disassembling heart-stopping sequences and to the Christopher Nolan DC trilogy, especially with Warner's 2008 classic \"The Dark Knight,\" for its courage to deal with sore, meaningful purposes with a firm hand and mind-blowing ideas, piling layer after layer on the characters and the plot.To the rhythm of the all-time original theme by Argentine Lalo Schifrin - which was written in full in a three-minute period, a true impossible mission, - \"Jack Reacher\" filmmaker Christopher McQuarrie immerses us in the plot, getting down to the moral issues, picking up the timeline alongside most of the well-known characters after an undisclosed time since the events of \"Rogue Nation,\" presenting the main mission that will lead our fav spies to venture into the most imposing wonders in the world, dreamscapes where explosive surprises will take place, playing around with the bad and good guys in a progressive whipsaw that will end in a devilishly old-school twist, vitalizing via \"hyper-Hitchcockian\" anticipations that cement solid intrigue and interest in one of the most eye-popping, high-impact set-pieces you'll see this year. Moviemaking, good moviemaking is a joint process in which hundreds of agents play a role in favor of making the vision of a single individual a reality, the director is that individual. McQuarrie isn't oblivious to good, grandiloquent action extravaganzas, that's for sure, he isn't oblivious to equally coherent and captivating narrative constructions, or much less, to team up with Cruise, either directly or indirectly. On the basis of the foregoing, with irrefutable logic, it's correct to affirm that, in fact, he isn't oblivious to \"Mission: Impossible,\" being responsible for the direction and writing of the fifth (previous) installment of the saga. This filmmaker not only has the necessary qualities to pull off another strong Abrams-produced production, but also finds time to expand his scope as a screenwriter while giving his own personal seal as an artist with powerful and always focused additions that embellish the cinematic process in a fascinating way. In addition to enjoying a clear magic directing actors on set, the Oscar-winning writer knows exactly when and how to move the gears for each genre, has the precise measurement of baking for either a drama or comedy moment, knows how to intersperse clear, static and fast shots to compose unrelenting sequences, knows how to keep his vision alive, knows that taking real risks is necessary and, in short, knows how to direct mega-productions with verve and conviction. McQuarrie makes this sixth installment go forward and not backward as usually happens with sequels, as keeps the whole movie moving, everything spins and works like a Swiss watch, with precision, fast pace and poise. According to many viewers, we're in front of the best film in the series, and taking into consideration the not-so-low standards of the succession of films started by Brian de Palma in 1996, one of the best sagas in the history of action film. His direction is an indisputable harmony, ears and eyes alike enjoy the excellent work carried out despite the difficulties that arose throughout the shooting, however, his role is greater by accrediting as the only screenwriter, his boldness, odds in favor, gets wonderful results for contemporary Hollywood cinema. Hunt receives a story that, albeit not break the usual spy canons where the game of cat and mouse is a constant or where the 'no-one-is-what-they-seem-to-be' formula comes to light in the third act, it's a treatment pushing him to unusual edges, causing the emergence of issues that involve and mix the moral with the ethical, deeper and more interesting dilemmas that compel him to think more than once what he's about to do. To sum things up, the screenwriter bestows three-dimensionality, he's thought of as a human being in spite of his extravagant actions, a human cornered not only by a trio of nuclear bombs.This leads us to the fast-paced twist the plot itself becomes. McQuarrie provides well-defined resolutions from the beginning to create new ones with such sensitivity and understanding that hardly anyone can anticipate that true-blue heart-stopping last thirty minutes. It's an incredibly harmonized screenplay between character development and exposition of the events that conceives an impressive spy movie, the best of its kind since the billion-dollar Sam Mendes-directed film \"Skyfall.\"An A-1 mainstream film must represent each feature of the script to the screen in the best way possible, however, an A-1 mainstream actioner must articulate smoothly the above with, of course, emblematic sequences. Every new movie in the 22-year franchise provides substantial added value coming in the form of legendary Tom Cruise, a true super-man who categorically rejects the use of stunt performers for his high-risk scenes. Modesty apart, Cruise is an actor who, literally and figuratively, gets under Ethan Hunt's skin, he's Hunt, thus becoming one of the few stars who perform their own action scenes today in Hollywood. This time, forget scratches and bruises, an on-set ankle injury has called him, an accident that halted the movie's shooting until his health improved - as a curious note, the editing team incorporated the sequence of the accident in the final cut for honoring the feats of the American idol. - But the cinematic push is further enhanced by the perfect, high-standard motion picture film format: IMAX 3D. Lower-voltage scenes get a drastically reduced ratio and the hyperactive, dangerous, bold acrobatics by Mr. Cruise make full use of the overwhelming magnitudes of the screen, stepping up the immersive experience with a sound system as surround as only IMAX can do, conveying sensations of emotion and adrenaline, mixtures between danger and intrigue that, even knowing in advance that our hero is practically immortal, deliver a two-hour heart attack. Forget theme parks, run to watch Christopher McQuarrie's latest, non-stop action-packed movie!Drawing upon some landscapes and townscapes of India, UK, France and New Zealand, Rob Hardy, a modern cinematography maestro who has built artistic sci-fi gems such as \"Annihilation\" and \"Ex Machina,\" places his exquisite style in a setting far from fantasy, getting artfully neat visuals on its objectives with high levels of elegance, sobriety and magnetism on costume and production design, in the old-fashioned Parisian streets or the crushing European dreamscapes. Commitment by each and every one of the members of the huge technical and artistic team is awe-inspiring, they esteem a big budget, and, moreover, prioritize film's artistic purpose over the ever-lurking avidity for extravagant grosses.There are few cases where a commercial advertisement transcends beyond its purpose, here one of the best examples. The creators of the trailer released during Super Bowl LII must not only headline the year-end best trailers lists by critics and movie reviewers, but receive a true award for their exceptional, exceptional work. Although few talk about this kind of stuff in their reviews, the perfectly matched 2-minute stunner made by highly skilled trailer makers deserves it; one of the best trailers of this decade.\"Mission: Impossible-Fallout\" by Christopher McQuarrie smashes, on several occasions and ways, big-budget action movie tropes much like contemporary classics do, moving away from the artificiality of danger to get fully into building a true-blue adrenaline rush. In these times, making high-quality action films in Hollywood has become an impossible feat, putting the blame on plotting emptiness and tech breakthroughs that bury a good narrative. However, with an overlong period of time in between, mainstream gems serendipitily flourishes trying to propose through risks. That is what makes this \"MI\" entry to take part in the select, coveted must-see top of the last eighteen years. Film doesn't falsify reality, imitates it, for this reason, those breathtaking, stunning- in the vast majority truthful -set-pieces are an out-of-this-world experience, where suspense, adrenaline and enjoyment are involuntary reactions to a cinematic cocktail everyone should see. A spectacular, unforgettable roller-coaster ride that vitalizes a billion-dolar spy franchise, a triumph that must be experienced in the largest IMAX screen.",

            "content": "Mission Impossible: Fallout (5 out of 5 stars).Mission Impossible: Fallout is an awesome, exciting action packed sequel that shows Tom Cruise is up for more crazy stunts. From jumping out of an HALO plane, being chased on a motorcycle in Paris, running and jumping on rooftops in London, and flying an helicopter and being caught in a dogfight. These movies get better through sequels and I am not complaining that they should stop. Each movie gets better and tops the one before. Fallout is probably the best one out of six movies now. Sure, I find Tom Cruise climbing the burj khalifa to be the most intense stunt and the motorcycle chase scene in Rogue Nation to be well done and the best action sequence. Fallout in general has a lot going for it. From a plot that has a lot of pieces moving with characters betraying another. Double and triple crosses with each other. But it all makes sense in the end when everything is pieced together. The plot follows Ethan Hunt (Tom Cruise) and his team Benji (Simon Pegg) and Luthor (Ving Rhames) are on a mission trying to retrieve stolen nuclear devices. When the mission goes awry and Ethan has to face the consequences of saving ones life over millions. They are forced to have a shadow from the CIA with August Walker (Henry Cavill) tagging along with them on there missions. While a terrorist group called The Apostles are after the nuclear devices. A lot more goes on with the plot which makes it better. But the less you know before going to see it, the better. There are a few twists that will surprise you. Characters wearing masks and fooling the audience that will leave you surprised. And a few triple crosses. Yes, Ilsa Faust (Rebecca Ferguson) returns with her own agenda that may interfere with Hunt's mission. The movie is loaded with action packed set pieces throughout. I will consider this to be the best action movie of the year so far. Definitely, a summer blockbuster type of movie while it is keeping you thinking and focused on its heavy-handed plot. Writer/Director Christopher McQuarrie does well with topping each action scene over the one before that. From a HALO jump scene that is dizzying and crazy. To a brutal fight scene in the bathroom at a club. To a convoy breakout that leads Ethan being chased by the police with more bad guys after him while Faust is hot on his trail as well. To an overlong rooftop running scene that shows Tom Cruise can jump and sprint for long distances. Then, the climatic finale with Tom Cruise being in an aerial combat dogfight while flying a helicopter which is dizzying and thrilling but the best aerial combat scene shot on film. Tom Cruise is at his best again. Henry Cavill is a great addition as well playing a character that is hard to trust. Ving Rhames and Simon Pegg are still good. Pegg having more hands on action this time. Rebecca Ferguson is great playing a character that is difficult on trusting but has feelings for Ethan while they have different agendas on their mission. Sean Harris returns with that monotone voice but is still menacing. Alec Baldwin was great too with having more confidence in Ethan's actions and choices even though he does not show it. The music score Lorne Balfe was also good and helped create the tone of the movie which is a bit darker. His score almost sounds similar to Hans Zimmer. Overall, Mission Impossible Fallout is a great film. If you are into the series or not. This film will definitely win newcomers. The action sequences are top notch exciting and thrilling. There is a lot of action from beginning to end. The cast is great. The plot is all over the place but works well with the twist and turns. Tom Cruise is not holding back with stunts. This 2 and half hour film does feel short when the pace flies so fast with its busy plot and non stop action. You may finally catch a breath when it is over.",

But as a sequel, it did not lift up the game, rather it came up as a rehash of the same. The movie was definitely watchable, but not a stand out vs. the MI series. Its stunts, acting, editing were superb but just a copy from the past. The movie definitely took a beating in the storyline and in sketching out the characters, the plot. It descended too quickly into the usual shoot and run scenes. I blinked repeatedly to tell myself that this is Mission Impossible and not an import from Fast & Furious. On the positive side though, Tom Cruise acted the part. He was sharp, fit and looked the role. There was some subtle humor and subdued glamour that was refreshing. Overall it was a movie that comes and goes like the waves on a sea shore. There are little or no remnants that it left behind and soon it will be all but etched from memory.",

            "review_title": "Tops \"Rogue Nation\" By A Hair!",
            "content": "Clocking in at an impressive 147 minutes, the fifth \"Mission Impossible\" sequel code-named \"Fallout\" seems like almost too much of a good thing. As director Christopher McQuarrie's second outing as helmer-he called the shots on \"Mission Impossible: Rogue Nation,\" \"Fallout\" boasts more exhilarating, white-knuckled stunts than its predecessor--\"Mission impossible: Rogue Nation!\" The catch here is Tom Cruise has done virtually all his stunts for real. Reportedly, the actor spent an entire year preparing himself for the HALO (High Altitude Low Opening) parachute jump. Indeed, he performed this stunt as well as four others without the use of either CGI or stunt doubles. Cruise careened through the crowded streets of Paris astraddle a motorcycle riding against traffic without a helmet, sprinted across rooftops in London, and flew a helicopter. The rooftop leap of faith is what cost him; he fractured his ankle and production shut down for eight weeks while he recuperated. Clearly, Cruise is an adrenaline junkie obsessed with making things appear as genuine as possible under closely supervised conditions. Presumably, the people who insured the headstrong actor for all these stunts must have been sweating bullets. Mind you, the negotiations that ensued just for all the location work in Paris, France, must have constituted a nightmare for local authorities, with McQuarrie and his cast and crew racing around the City of Lights as well as photographing it from the air. Movies like \"Fallout\" inevitably turn into travelogues with spectacular cinematography of all its exotic locales, ranging from Paris to London to Norway to New Zealand. Sure, if you haven't seen its predecessor \"Rogue Nation,\" you might be at a loss to appreciate the appearances not only of actress Rebecca Ferguson's character Ilsa Faust but also actor Sean Harris' villainous Solomon Lane wearing a beard. For the record, Simon Pegg, Ving Rhames, Michelle Monaghan, and Alec Baldwyn reprise their roles from earlier installments. Despite its length, however, \"Fallout\" surpasses even the slickly-made \"Rogue Nation.\"\"Fallout\" opens with a startled Ethan Hunt awakening from a nightmare after an anonymous courier comes knocking at his safe house with a copy of Homer's Odyssey. In his nightmare, Hunt had dreamed he was marrying his ex-wife Julia (Michelle Monaghan) again in an island paradise when he noticed that the minister is none other than the murderous Solomon Lane. After the courier departs, Hunt cracks the book which has been hollowed out for a tape-recording device and a video camera. Although Hunt and his team devastated 'The Syndicate' in \"Rogue Nation,\" survivors of that terrorist organization have reconstituted themselves as 'The Apostles' to complicate our hero's life. During his time-honored briefing (a trope in all IMF films), Hunt learns the Apostles plan to supply John Lark, the ultimate boogeyman, with three plutonium cores that can be used in nuclear devices. Abandoning his safe house in Belfast, Hunt heads for Berlin where Benji Dunn (Simon Pegg of \"Hot Fuzz\") and Luther Stickell (Ving Rhames of \"Pulp Fiction\") join him to buy those cores. Predictably, everything goes sideways at the last second, but Hunt saves Luther's life after the villains hold him at gunpoint in exchange for those three cores. Hunt and Benji rush to Luther's aid just moments after they obtain the cores. While they are removing the slugs from Luther's bulletproof vest, the villains snatch the cores, and everybody in Washington, D.C., hates Hunt. Hunt and company capture an expert in nukes, Nils Debruuk (Kristoffer Joner of \"The Revenant\"), who had been collaborating with the Apostles to construct portable nuclear weapons for those cores. They trick Debruuk into revealing Lark's whereabouts. Lark is scheduled to meet with a go-between in Paris, the notorious White Widow (Vanessa Kirby of \"The Crown\") and walk off with the goods. Hunt is prepared to plunge out of a CIA transport plane and intercept him, when CIA Director Erica Sloane (Angela Bassett of \"Black Panther\") threatens to cancel the mission unless the IMF team take Special Activities Division operative August Walker (Henry Cavill of \"Justice League\") along to make sure Hunt doesn't screw up again. Sloan slams Hunt for saving one of his IMF colleagues at the expense of losing the cores. The problem with Hunt's plan at this point is nobody, including the White Widow, knows John Lark by sight. Hunt and Walker plummet into Paris via HALO and find themselves in trouble from the get-go. They tangle with somebody they believe is Lark, and wind up renovating the men's restroom. You'd have to go back to \"Terminator 2\" for a comparable clash. Impetuously, Hunt poses as Lark, and then learns he must kidnap his old adversary Solomon Lane from the French police before he can acquire the two remaining cores. The White Widow gives him one as a down payment. Little does our hero know he will come face-to-face with rogue MI6 Agent Ilsa Faust (Rebecca Ferguson of \"Hercules\") who plans to kill Lane, so MI6 will forgive her. Indeed, double and triple-crosses multiply in this rip-snorting saga that virtually defies synopsis with a plot so Byzantine that you almost need to crib notes to keep track of all its larger-than-life shenanigans! \"Annihilation\" lenser Rob Hardy should land an Oscar for his spectacular, picture-postcard cinematography. Truly, the world is all a stage for \"Mission Impossible: Fallout\" and Paris looks better than ever.Writer & director Christopher McQuarrie doesn't dawdle with \"Fallout\" any more than he did with \"Rogue Nation.\" Marathon qualifies as an apt description of all the time that flies by in \"Fallout,\" and it amounts to a rollercoaster of a ride that never lets up, with a finale involving two helicopters smashing into one another. While it doesn't look realistic, the Paris lavatory brawl is a stunner! These two IMF films borrow a lot from the James Bond franchise, from the HALO dive to gadgetry, but they ignore romance. Like its polished predecessor, \"Mission Impossible: Fallout\" packs just as much punch as it does plot.",

And to top it all off, the government bastards don't really trust Ethan, so they send a babysitter, Henry Cavill as August Walker. Ok, so the big mystery of this one... there's a mystery guy out there working against Ethan's team, and they seem to know their every move. So Ethans entire team, and August Walker is out to recapture Solomon and stop the madness before the mystery bad spy can get him. Who could it be??? The basic cast has remained the same, a few additions along the way, and then there's Henry Cavill's character, this one will be tough to figure out. But a really fun entertaining flick... Were they hinting at Ethan Hunt getting a little old?? Several scenes were focused on Hunt catching his breath....maybe its just me... Filmbufftim on FB.",

There are several reasons for this:\n* Well written albeit not very original script.\n* Competent acting.\n* And above all, as per usual in the Mission Impossible series, outstanding action set pieces.\nI could go on forever enumerating the virtues of this movie but without boring you, I'll just say that this is what you have to do to make a great action movie. No shaky cam work, no fast lightning editing where you cannot get a grasp of the geography or in short, what the hell is going on and most importantly, a WELL WRITTEN script. Is that to much to ask for?.\nTake notes, Michael Bay.\nAnd in this movie, more than in any other in the series, we get a glimpse into the psyche of its main character. A clearly aging and emotionally exhausted Ethan Hunt, must contend, once again, with a conspiracy to deploy three nuclear weapons, that it's filled to the brim with twists, turns and all manner of double crossings coming from all directions in the form of former allies and enemies. We get a sense that Tom Cruise's character is beginning to get tired of his line of work and in some instances, the restroom fistfight, he's being physically outmatched by his foe. Some old ground is retread and Hunt still comes out on top, but we get a sense that it's getting more and more difficult to get there. That gives his character a much needed vulnerability in the action genre.\nThe secondary characters do a solid supporting job, especially a particularly nasty and brutal Henry Cavill.\nThe set pieces are superb. The Halo jump takes the cake. This IMAX one shot aerial sequence is superbly done and really pushes the envelope when it comes to action set pieces of this kind.\nThe restroom fistfight, the motorcycle chase throughout Paris, the foot chase scene, where Cruise injured himself and the helicopter chase and final fight hanging from a cliff between Cavill and Cruise are the stand out set pieces of the movie.\nIn short, How to make a great action flick 101.",

As said before, the action entertains in the moment but if I were to go back to any Mission Impossible movie I know it wouldn't be this one, as not only is the action less inspired but the story is too, with out of nowhere character moments, and a clich\u00e9 diffuse the bomb story, and a predictable secret agent betrayal, the story had me snoozing and just checking my watch hoping it would end soon. The actors are passable, although it seems they're not giving it their all like they have before, Henry Cavill and Simon Pegg give particularly questionable performances. Combine that with bog standard clich\u00e9 dialogue that had me rolling my eyes at times, and comedy that really didn't land (we're seriously still doing the \"character doesn't notice something going on outside the window\" gag?), and I feel the movie really isn't worth sitting through for the action sequences (which were well shot might I add) and score.

Having watched the trailers and being a fan of the series, I was very excited to watch the film. And once again, the M: I series did the impossible.Plot: Ethan and his IMF Team are tasked to work with CIA Agent August Walker to recover 3 plutonium cores that could be used for nuclear fallout.Story and direction: This series doesn't fail to surprise me. Each time I wonder what new they will bring to a franchise. Because by the time a sixth film does come in there is franchise exhaustion. But McQuarrie (who also directed ROGUE NATION) very well understood what he is dealing with and gave us and enthralling and memorable action film to watch. The story may not be ground-breaking in any way, but it was engaging enough to keep me glued to my seat and relish 147 minutes of pure fun. I was not bored for a single scene. The film is quite darker and mellowed down than the previous films, which I very well appreciate. The cinematography is just wonderful and captures the essence and beauty of the captivating locations perfectly. The action scenes and VFX are top-notch. The makers really upped the ante in terms of both the story and action aspect. Even the score is just awesome. Lorne Balfe has really done a good job and I can also term it the best score of the series. Performances: Tom Cruise is as usual the main star of the series and it is quiet a sin to fault him for a role he has excelled at doing for 22 years. Same goes to the eccentric Ving Rhames. Simon Pegg never fails to impress me even in the scenes that don't require comedy. Henry Cavill gave a compelling performance. Where it was felt in ROGUE NATION that Solomon Lane was not justified, Sean Harris just nails the role here. Rebecca Ferguson also added her charm and charisma to the screen. Vanessa Kirby, Angela Basset and Michelle Monaghan were good additions to the film.Favorite Scene: Not spoiling anything, the scene was kind of an epilogue between Ethan and Julia. It was beautiful and poignant to see these two characters on screen together after a very long time. Also the dialogues in that scene were very beautiful, which instantly attracted me to the scene. In addition to this scene, the final action sequence of the helicopter chase was jaw-dropping. Each time I was on the edge of my seat.Verdict: FALLOUT would be the best the M: I Series has yet to offer. I feel that for a sixth film they did justice and lived up to the name. I walked out of the hall satisfied both as a fan and a movie-goer. If there will be a seventh instalment, it better be in par with this one or above this (which I think is very difficult to top).

            "content": "Even after 22 years and now six films in, the creative minds behind this film franchise do not disappoint with this latest offering. Following the events of \"Rogue Nation\", Ethan Hunt and his team must track the elusive John Lark, an unknown man who has links to the Apostles (a subgroup within the Syndicate) and to find missing plutonium planned to be used for nuclear desolation. However as is known in this franchise, the mission becomes far more complex and dangerous for everyone involved.A host of familiar faces return for this latest mission such as series lead Tom Cruise as Ethan Hunt, Ving Rhames as hacker member Luther, Simon Pegg as the nerdy yet helpful Benji and Rebecca Ferguson as the skilled sole female member of the team, Ilsa Faust (who is far less of a femme fatale after \"Rogue Nation\" and is more included as a member of Hunt's IMF team). Cruise is charismatic and engaging to watch as ever with his 6th portrayal of Ethan Hunt. Ethan is still dedicated to his team and continuously makes the choice to protect them despite this being a costly error in the film's opening sequence. However we know that Ethan can save the world against all the odds. Cruise continues to impress with insane stunts which are upped to the ante in this film as Cruise performs a HALO jump, rides a motorbike dangerously through the Parisian streets without a helmet, jumping off roofs (which resulted in a broken ankle) and piloting a helicopter during the climatic showdown and also hanging from a cliff-face. Yikes! Joining the cast as the wild card is \"Man of Steel\" star, Henry Cavill as CIA assassin August Walker. While Cavill isn't exactly the most emotive actor, the Superman actor is able to hold his own alongside Tom Cruise. Walker is the more ethical foil (almost like Ilsa in her pursuit of Syndicate leader Solomon Lane throughout this film) to Hunt's renegade IMF agent; he is looking out for the CIA's interest in seeking the plutonium lost in the opening scene. Being a known physical actor (as seen in \"Man of Steel\") Cavill captures the combative scenes with an ease that compliments his costar's own prowess. Then there's Walker's own secrets that come to light as the climax hits with twists and turns, but this won't be spoiled here.Writer-director Christopher McQuarrie returns to the chair to helm his 2nd M:I film after the success of helming \"Rogue Nation\" three years prior. McQuarrie's writing is definitely sharp and snappy when needed, but the director does not forget to insert an instance of humor to lighten the mood. The editing is a little sloppy at points and the run-time could've been trimmed a good ten to fifteen minutes, but the story doesn't fail to engage the audience. Yes while we know what to expect from this franchise, but we keep coming back because of its stories and Tom Cruise's star power. This a mission you should definitely accept.",

This film has surpassed its predecessors just as each installment has seemed to do. From the opening scene to the roll of the credits, this movie had me on the edge of the seat with palms sweaty and the steady sound of my thumping heart beat. \n Conflicting situations that seem to have no possible solution fill the runtime, along with brilliant camera work that'll slow down the epic sequences into moments that'll be remembered forever.\n McQuarrie proves he has the masterful talent to carry out this franchise into the masterpiece each new installment has become. His filmmaking will leave you feeling for each character, whether good or bad, and feeling every punch they take, as well. \n Proven with just one viewing, this film is a masterpiece. It's one for the shelf and one that'll entertain for decades and decades to come. \n Calling it close, as the IMF team famously does, is exactly what this film doesn't do. It calls it as soon as it starts its first scene because this one has taken the top of its series and of the summer.\n Action, adventure, suspense, running, HALO jumps, helicopter chases, and one hell of an ending that'll not be confirmed nor denied, of course, without the approval of the secretary.\n-TE (7.28.18)",

Tom Cruise is his usual, reliable, athletic self in this vehicle and is quite impressive in the action sequences for his age. Sean Harris returns as a scowling Mission Impossible villain. And Henry Cavill almost steals the film with a compelling, bristling performance.Although I did find the film's climax a bit protracted, there was never a slow, less than gripping phase in this film.

RainMan vs. Superman easily could've been the pitch to the latest chapter in the indefatigable action/espionage film franchise with the ever unflappable and gung-ho Cruise (in total control) reprising his Ethan Hunt to stop a global threat - missing plutonium in the hands of a former foe loose and recklessly hell-bent on destroying the world as we know it and only having his demons stopping him, and a monkey wrench in the works with Cavill (well-cast in a shrewd casting touch) as a duplicitous assassin in the fold. Filmmaker Christopher McQuarrie - who also wrote the lean, mean screenplay - signs up for his second outing in the series and excels in keeping things dangerously break-neck in so many sequences its hard to catch-up while holding your breath from a hella-good fist-fight in a nightclub's men's room to a daredevil car/motorcycle chase to its hair-raising chopper cat-and-mouse climax in a literal, hum-dinger of a cliffhanger that you'll be checking your pulse as the adrenaline flows (helps to see it in all its amazing awe in IMAX). Cruise is literally death-defying in doing all his own stunt-work (no CGI for the most part) and a strong supporting cast to boot. One of the best action films ever and one of the year's best.

            "content": "MISSION IMPOSSIBLE : FALLOUT - So for me , it's the 2nd best of the series. And came very very close to the best GHOST PROTOCOL. But both movies are far different. With Ghost Protocol it was total consistency. The movie was great thorughout all the running time. But in case of FALLOUT it's pretty average jn the first half , then start to get better and the last action set piece is one of the best , gorgeous and Realistic set piece ever made in the history of film making , which more then compensate for the average writing came before it.Let me be clear - It's an awesome movie.But writing was very very very repeatative. U r gonna see a lot of things happening in the film which happened in Rogue Nation. Infact a person says to Ethan Hunt in this film that 'if YOU WILL GO ROGUE HE WILL KILL YOU' This same dialogue was said to him in Rogue Nation too. in rogue Nation the Head of the CIA at the end of the film says that now he understand that there will always be a need of IMF. In this film too the Head of the CIA (Now changed) say the same thing at the end. In Rogue Nation the character of Rebecca Furguson chases Ethan Hunt throughout the film with opposite agenda , she does the same things in this movie too. But that doesn't mean that the writing is as average as Rogue Nation. No . It's better. And some new things happen too. It's just that this movie with so many action set pieces could have been the Best MI film if the writing has been better , but it didn't happened. Some predictability hurt the film too . I already new the MOLE far before it was revealed. Also why Furguson was working against Ethan Hunt was pretty clear from the start too. But the again some small surprises were there which I was not able to see coming.Hence time to talk about the actions. First and foremost the End Action set piece with Two Helicopters. O My My. Such a great action scene. Totally done in real. Breathtaking. Shown to be happening in KASHMIR but was half shot in New Zealand and Half in Norway. After that two of the best we're BATHROOM FIST FIGHT (where Henry Cavell shines best) and 2nd was the LONDON ROOFTOP RUNNING SCENE(where Tom Again proves that no one can run more gorgeously in Hollywood then him).Now when it comes to acting , I would like to start with Henry Cavell. Because I find him exceptionally average. He is good when he doesn't open his mouth. He looks stylish , fights great. But when he says , he clearly proves that he is no great actor , and I don't think he will be ever.Do I have to say anything about Tom Cruise , no I don't think so. Apart from Cruise who shines best for me was Vanessa Kirby(of THE CROWN FAME) playing White Widow. Who although had a small role but acted beautifully. And I think her character will continue to pope in future installments. The music and Cinematography were very innovative. Infact I think there will be a high chance of nomination in Cinematography catogory along with Sound Effect and Sound Mixing.I know I was late to watch the film. But at least I got the chance. And this was surely worth every penny. 8.5/10",

This sixth installment of the series never forgets its MO - to entertain. It easily works as a stand-alone film requiring only a smidgeon of backstory. It has superb staging, a combination of spycraft, intrigue and action. It is as convoluted as the wiring mechanism on a nuclear device but it still manages to keep the viewer's interest with boldness and confidence in the telling with thrilling races against time and trademark surprises. It is all buffed smoothly with a stirring soundtrack. The film's appeal boils down to the visceral - the stunts. Although there isn't a series-defining sequence like with the original, Cruise admirably performing many of his own stunts provides a renewed interest in this subgenre. It's a bit too long and the plot takes some following The third act drags amid escalating absurdity, a combination of one part fatigue and one part thrill as one high octane sequence follows another. As an aside, it is worth noting that Tom Cruise is as old here as Roger Moore was in his final outing as a fantasy spy. Both had charisma - the glue that makes these films work. No one hustles harder than Cruise in these films. He might deserver a lifetime award for 'human special effect'.",

            "content": "I've always wondered how it is that tent poll action movies one after the other get such high scores. It doesn't matter if they're terrible, mediocre, or good, they always rate from the low 80s to middle 90s, no matter the quality of story or if one exists. Keeps happening over and over and I thought maybe it's because guys just love the crud out of these movies no matter the plot. I can accept that. And some of these movies are clearly just geared toward men. I can accept that too, and usually I won't bother to write a review on those, and some times won't bother to rate it 'cause clearly I'm not the intended audience. Which, does hackle me that guys will go out of their way to write and score a bad review for a movie clearly intended for women that they haven't even seen. So annoying along with immature. Women are half the population. The expectation that all should be geared toward men is ridiculous, childish and selfish when women pay for half the movie tickets. MI is clearly a movie meant for men that they want to attract a female audience for, so, all though I originally had no real interest in reviewing this, in light of looking at the female IMDB ratings for MI: Fallout and for Mamma Mia: Here We Go Again, I simply couldn't let it go. Clearly something is up. I get it, Tom Cruise is a big, rich star and his ego is invested, so, he needs high scores and reviews along with box office tickets...but, I'm compelled to say, enough is enough. There is simply no way on god's green earth that women of all ages rated MI; 5, one of the weaker of the franchise, higher than Mamma Mia:2, and by a considerable amount. Impossible. Literally impossible. I went to see Mamma Mia:2 with a group on opening weekend on a Tuesday afternoon and the theatre was almost sold out, and entirely women, along with the theatre across the hall that was also showing MM:2. We went to talk about it afterwards and everyone loved it. Didn't think it was rocket science but fully enjoyed it. Every woman I talked to had either seen it and loved it or was going to see it and looking forward to it. I think the score MM:2 is fairly accurate. Like I said, it's very enjoyable but not like it's a great film, just fun. I saw MI:2 on Thursday night a week after it opened and the theatre was almost empty and almost all men. My only allure to see MI:5, to be honest, was Rebecca Ferguson. I enjoyed the first two MI, but MI:3, was fairly whatever, and I had little interest in seeing 4. I've been a long time fan of Tom Cruise, but he's simply getting up there in age and he's got Bourne Identity and a ton of other action films to compete with over the years, so, I'm just less inspired to see this sort of played out franchise. Not as much as James Bond, which my dad still likes, but no one else I know. The Kingsmen had promise, but then the second one sucked. I enjoyed the first 90 minutes of MI:5 as far as a fairly pointless action movie that didn't have much plot...then, the script sort of went off the rails enough so that they couldn't fix it in the editing room and prayed that people would just not notice or get confused and think they missed something. There were 3 serious plot holes that happened within 5-10 minutes of the film at the 90 minute mark. You simply can't miss that. Well, given today's viewing audience I guess they can...or maybe just not care. That really lost it for me because it made the rest entirely pointless. Not to mention, it's all very predictable. I knew the villain from the beginning. I knew the twists before they happened. MI really does not have much more to offer. And the villain when you give it even a second to think about it makes absolutely zero sense. None of it makes any sense. I don't mean I didn't understand it, I was up to speed the whole way through, I just mean it's in no way believable. Also, it's super dark. MI is supposed to be fun, not talking about starving populations, ending the world, etc. Why is everyone trying to be Dark Knight? Just be your own thing. Back to my point, aside from the mediocrity of this film, which, has more going for it then Fast & Furious, just not enough anymore and super played out, is that there is no way women of all ages unanimously loved this film. It's just pointless dude action from one action moment to the next with a paper-thin plot that falls completely apart at 90 minutes. There is very little dialogue. It's basically '90s Jean-Claude Van Damme on a budget. You can sit women in front of a screen with a trace of a plot, pretty faces and singing for 90 minutes and entertain them, but you can not sit them in front of pointless action for 160 minutes and expect them to be anything but upset. Not to mention the obvious handing the torch from Michelle Monaghan to Rebecca Ferguson, aging-out at 42 and the first sign of a wrinkle is going to annoy any female audience member. Like, really, she's too old for the dude in his 50s still pretending he's jumping out of buildings? Ferguson and Monaghan literally look identical. The fact they think women are so stupid they don't know Monaghan has aged out while Tom is getting too much Botox and still going at it is just lame. Not to mention, they think that women don't notice that they've replaced Monaghan, the dutiful wife who sits home by the phone while her man saves the world, with the carbon-copy Ferguson, who fights by her man, but really still doesn't have much of an existing roll other than to look hot in tight, black outfits, occasionally punch someone, and occasionally look at the hero with a smoldering look. Gag. Can we please move on from this. Played out. Played out. Played out.Next.",

            "content": "The movie started out extremely good. Top notch action & great writing with a good amount of humor. It was completely on par with the best movies of the franchise until then.\nSomewhere in the second half the movie turned really bad. It's painfully obvious that McQuarrie tried too hard to write a smart script, so he added an unoriginal, redundant plot twist a la \"I knew exactly what would happen so All of this is actually my plan\". It's pretty much the same type of twist as in Rogue Nation, but this time McQuarrie made it overly complicated and yet somehow predictable (I mean did anybody not expect Henry Cavill's character to be a bad guy?). It actually made me wonder if McQuarrie adds a twist of that kind to every single project he writes.After that, the movie doesn't really recover. The finale is just a collection of absurdly unrealistic scenarios. Don't get me wrong, I don't expect M:I to be 100% realistic, after all that's part of what makes me love the films so much. But many of the things happening in Fallout could've just as well been in Sharknado. A helicopter falling if a cliff but conveniently being saved by a random hook somehow attaching itself to the stone ground? Even Mission Impossible 2 laughs at this. Snother example is the moment when the detonator is rushing towards the edge just to slowly stop right before it after a cut. That's right, the movie actually managed to make continuity errors between cuts a plot device (there were actually quite many errors in the lighting/color continuity between cuts as well, though this is nitpicking). Even ignoring this, the occurances in the finale were much too influenced by luck to be considered anything but messy. To be fair, the effects for all of this were obviously as great as you'd expect them to be (nitpicking: the bullets of the LMG Walker uses from the helicopter are weirdly animated to look like lasers), my only problems are really with the action itself. Oh, and of course the bombs were only defused one second before they would've detonated (even though I found that moment was quite well-justified).Overall this movie was really great in the beginning but felt like the screenwriter was replaced by a first year film student for the third act. I was really looking forward to this movie as I loved its predecessors, but sadly I left the screening disappointed. Of course a bad ending might not affect your overall opinion of the movie as much as it did for me or you might disagree that the ending is bad in the first place, but to me it really dragged down what started out to be a great addition to the franchise.",

            "content": "\"I won't let you down.\" Ethan Hunt (Tom Cruise)He doesn't let us down. If you're looking for an entertaining thriller with a sympathetic hero, minimally eccentric villains, little visible blood, and chases that seem never to end, then see Mission Impossible: Fallout, the best adventure story this summer and certainly one of the best of all time.It's not just that Ethan Hunt can ride a motorcycle at 100 miles an hour, sky dive at 25,000 feet, and drive a helicopter; it's just that Tom Cruise can do that and does in this film and his others. Hunt and his buddies are in the clich\u00e9d area of saving the world from a nuclear blast, as we watch the LED go slowly to zero with little chance to stop the plutonium-based bomb.The takeaway from this dynamic thriller is that Hunt has been vulnerable more than once because of his unwillingness to sacrifice the lives of his associates, despite the fact that millions of people could live if he did sacrifice them. That charity is questioned along the way with an astute observation that his kindness is both strength and weakness. It's nice to have the moral and intellectual challenge for the characters and us.It works well to humanize Hunt and his helpers because the film is predominantly director Christopher McQuarrie's chases and images of London and Paris that propel this visual banquet into greatness. Will Hunt and Cruise live to see another day? find out in an entertaining thriller made for IMAX. Spend the few extra dollars-those chases are real and up close on that giant screen. Pop corn goes well with this summer, pop-corn adventure.Just don't take Benji Dunn's (Simon Pegg) advice: \"I find it best not to look.\" Look and enjoy.",

Rogue Nation was practically a perfect Mission Impossible that had both great espionage intrigue and grounded action scenes, but Fallout is just all high-wire stunts.There are a few good moments with telegraphed clever twists, but it doesn't have an interesting and cohesive mission with fun heists or ops. It's mostly non-stop action, some of which, like the helicopter chase at the end of the film, is so over the top it breaks immersion.The tone can be inconsistent at times too. Rogue Nation did a great job a juggling the comedy with the drama, but in Fallout the transitions between the two are jaw-droppingly awkward.I was hopeful that Henry Cavill would be a cool character, but he actually has very little to do and doesn't really live up to the promise of a strong and equally capable foe.Overall I was fairly disappointed and would rank this MI among the worst of the franchise, possibly below MI3.If you like the Mission Impossible franchise there are enjoyable elements, but I'd caution against expecting a masterpiece like Rogue Nation. Heck, I dare say that MI2, with all its camp and John Woo silliness, is better than Fallout.",

Hunt & the rest of the IMF team join forces, to prevent devastating consequences from a failed mission. Mission: Impossible - Fallout is an awe-inspiring film. Returning director Christopher McQuarrie makes sure that he ups the ante from Mission: Impossible - Rogue Nation(2015), in all the aspects. This movie is an edge of the seat, action-packed, pulse-pounding, non-stop thrill ride. The action set pieces are the highlight of the film. The climactic set piece especially, will leave you gobsmacked. The most impressive part of the Mission: Impossible franchise is that, all the stunts are actually performed at real locations, with very little use of green screen & visual effects. The locales are exquisite. Tom Cruise is spectacular as Ethan Hunt. The fact that Cruise performs all his own death-defying stunts, makes us love & respect him even more. Henry Cavill is superb as August Walker. Ving Rhames is great as Luther Stickell. Simon Pegg is amazing as Benji Dunn. Rebecca Ferguson is brilliant as Ilsa Faust. Sean Harris is impressive as Solomon Lane. Angela Bassett is good as Erica Sloan. Vanessa Kirby is perfect as the White Widow. Michelle Monaghan, Wes Bentley, Frederick Schmidt & Alec Baldwin are excellent as Julia Meade-Hunt, Patrick, Zola & Alan Hunley, respectively. Mission: Impossible - Fallout is a must watch for Tom Cruise & Mission: Impossible fans. Go, have an absolute blast!",

There wasn't a single, solitary thing in this movie that wasn't completely childish and absurd. If this is your idea of an action movie, your ideas will change when you turn fourteen.So it's been many, many years since I've seen one of these moronic franchises, but I have a decent memory so I was expecting the worst. The movie delivers the worst right from the beginning.They still do the completely ridiculous stunt from the old 1960's TV in which the mission is secretly delivered, the protagonist listens (and now watches) his upcoming assignment, is given the option of passing on this one (your mission, if you choose to accept it), and then it self-destructs in five second. This is totally moronic in the digital age, but the knuckle-draggers want to see a little smoke if they can't get a spectacular explosion. Instead of the device burning up or exploding, wouldn't it be a lot more fun (and cinematic!) if they had a huge truck come by and bury the device in horse manure? Hooray for Hollywood!He arrives at a meet-up with a guy with plutonium in an alley, because that's just the best way to buy nuclear bomb material. The scene is just about the dumbest thing you are ever going to see at the Cineplex this year or last year. \"Oops, I forgot the plutonium.\"I have a rule and it's always correct: if the trailer for a movie has more than one explosion, the movie is a bomb (and not \"The Bomb\"). This one has many explosions...in the opening credits. They actually have a trailer for the movie at the beginning of this ridiculous movie.He does a HALO jump...to the center of Paris? Why not take the train?Flash forward to the next action scene (because the story is WAY too stupid to spend anything but the bare minimum of screen time). It's in a men's public bathroom that looks like it's in the Google headquarters, a nice quiet place for a cheesy martial arts sequence. Except it's a huge disco which means the bathrooms would be completely full all the time-small point, but still...and they did a HALO jump to get there for no real reason.The only vaguely interesting thing about the scene is that Tom C gets his butt handed to him by an Asian guy. The fighting is a complete insult to me because I actually know something about hand-to-hand combat, but it will wow 13 year old boys. The Asian guy grabs a pistol when they are on the ground wrestling. Tom C grabs the guy's wrist. Nope, don't ever do that. Grab the barrel...always grab the barrel.The story is the usual MI stuff about saving the world for humanity and should have been left for dead in that same public toilet. They simply string action scenes together with no thought about what comes between them.Here's what a NYT critic said:How is it possible that it yielded five sequels, and how is it conceivable that the sequels keep getting better, culminating in \"Mission: Impossible - Fallout\" (2018), which is pretty much an unqualified masterpiece?How is it possible that it yielded five sequels? Are you joking? A better question is how could a lame TV show from the 60s yield a single film? The only thing that made it out of the TV series was the theme music and the bit about the tape self-destructing, which is ridiculous in the digital era, and the music is a few puerile bars.Unqualified masterpiece? Wait. Does that mean good? Is he talking about the same movie I saw? Because the one I saw made almost no sense and was merely a bunch of ridiculously improbable actions scenes linked together by an even more ridiculously improbable story, if you can call it a story and I wouldn't. Evil man wants to destroy the world, plutonium, yawn. It's not fit entertainment for an adult.What difference does it make if Tom Cruise did his own stunts or not? Answer: it doesn't and who cares?",

As I said it's not big, it's just a bothering sentence is repeating every plan..Let's get started with the only thing I didn't like about this movie, and as I said it's the script.

Every action scene I was like \"OMG, thank you for giving me a masterpiece in action, thank you!\". I think it's the best action movie in 2018 so far.Quickly quickly.. let's move to the performances... I loved them all! What an act-convincing?! I have no other comment about the acting, cause it was quite perfect!Oh, we're not done yet, we still have the fascinating storytelling! I don't want to spoil anything, but I need to say that don't believe what you're watching, cause they will surprise you like hell!!!!\nThe story was good in every way that it could be, maybe at the beginning it didn't get my attention, but then it got my whole attention!Believe me, no one is overreacting when he says that this movie is a masterpiece, and if you don't believe us, go and see it yourself. It will not let you down, never ever!I actually wasn't excited to watch this movie, the trailer didn't get me at all, but it did actually give me what I want, it was way better than I expected it's gonna be!Oh, one more sadly thing I just remembered that I didn't like, the OST wasn't that good as it was so usual. But it wasn't so bad!I'm gonna give Mission: Impossible - Fallout an A, I think it's a magnificent movie, and definitely a worth-watching movie, I highly recommend watching this movie, guys.Okay, guys, thank you as always for reading my review, hope you like, and if you have any comment, please, say it to get improved.",

We all get great performances from Simon Pegg, Tom Cruise, and Alec Baldwin. I guess it probably could have used some more action. It's mostly because it seems to go on a little too long.

Tom Cruise is just an absolute madman, and the way he throws himself into all his stunts is just incredible. The story here is also really good with a great twist villain in Henry Cavill, even if it was spoiled in the trailer (there's a reason why I don't watch trailers anymore). The side characters are pretty much all enjoyable, and I liked seeing the return of characters from other films like Ilsa, Solomon Lane and his ex-wife Julia. The direction and cinematography is the best in the franchise by a decent portion, and that third act is just so unbelievably exciting to watch, and had me literally on the edge of my seat. I have two minor issues - some of the comedy falls a tad flat and not enough Angela Bassett. Otherwise, this is not only the best Mission Impossible film, and not only the best Tom Cruise film, but it is also one of the beat action films of the decade if not of all time, and I'd definitely, definitely recommend it.",

Then again, of the six movies that have been released so far I have only seen three of them, which means that there are probably a few things that I sort of don't get, such as this guy Solomon Ley. A part of me was a little confused at first because I remembered seeing one where Cruise is running around the Burg Kalifa, and I wasn't sure whether it was Ghost Protocol or Rogue Nation. Well, it turned out that it was Ghost Protocol, and because I didn't think all that much of that one, I sort of let Rogue Nation pass me by.\n Well, I guess that was a little mistake on my part, until I realised that films should at least try to stand on their own. If they are bringing too much in from previous films, then we end up with audiences that are way too lost to know what is going on, not that actually knowing what is going on really means anything when it comes to a Mission Impossible movie. Honestly, we can simply replace Solomon Lew with 'generic bad guy' and the syndicate with 'generic bad guy's organisation' and it really doesn't matter all that much.\n Not quite, because that was the last film, and Solomon Lew is now in custody. However, there happens to be a bunch of people called the 'Apostles', or 'generic group of thugs who used to be a member of the generic bad guy's organisation but since he was captured they are now on their own'. Sort of, because you have another generic bad guy who apparently is a contact for this ground of generic thugs, the catch is that nobody knows who they actually are. Then again, this is a spy thriller, so why would we expect any less.\n So what can you expect. Well, you can pretty much expect more of the same. If you've seen the other Mission Impossible films you probably know what you are going to get - Tom Cruise riding a motor-cycle, Tom Cruise doing stunts (or at least somebody who looks like Tom Cruise doing the stunts for him), and of course scenes where you look at it and scratch your head wandering how on Earth he was actually able to survive half the things that he actually survived. Oh, and they also have Simon Pegg in the film, which I think is pretty cool.\n Oh, and then there is the bait and switch. Sort of the way they set something up and you are led to believe one thing, and all of a sudden, once they have the information that they are looking for, the walls come down, the masks come off, and you realise that it is all a set up. Then again, I suspect they have this in all of the films, so in the end, while it is pretty cool, I suspect that once you know what is going on, and what these films are about, then you are going to pick them out from a mile away - I worked one of them out pretty quickly.",

Tom Cruise, even though looks aged and tired at times, does a decent job in portraying our very own Ethan Hunt.Rebecca Ferguson looks dazzling as Ilsa.In fact, her presence has made the last two installments of MI even more fascinating. The rest of the cast is fascinating and trustworthy as ever. Henry Cavill as the unscrupulous Walker steals the show. However, it is the action sequences which actually win your heart. Be rest assured that the stunts in the movie are breathtaking and perhaps unseen on celluloid. The climax is breathtaking. The visuals, the action, the locales, the stuns everything are just extraordinary. Overall, one of the finest action movies of all time.Do not dare to miss it.",

As the movie opens, Hunt is having a bad dream involving Julia, his ex-wife. He wakes up and we are in \"Belfast\", where Hunt gets his latest mission: to find three plutonium cores which the remnants of the bad guys in Rogue Nation, called the Apostles, are pursuing. Hunt goes to Berlin, where he reassemble the IMF team... At this point we're less than 10 min. into the movie, but to tell you more of the plot would spoil your viewing experience, you';; just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.Couple of comments: this is the 6th movie in the Mission Impossible franchise starring Tom Cruise. I've seen all of them, and I can unequivocally state that this is the BEST of the franchise. Written and directed by frequent Tom Cruise collaborator Christopher McQuarrie (Rogue Nation; Edge of Tomorrow; The Mummy), there is absolutely no sign that this franchise has run out of ideas. The plot is a bit hard to follow, but frankly, do we care all the much about a plot when we are there to see daredevil Cruise do stunts that nobody in Hollywood dare do, in fact nobody in the world. These scenes defy belief, but you seem happening in front of your very eyes. Some of them had been teased to us in the movie's trailer, but to now see the whole thing... The chases (yes, plural) in Paris are out of this world. And of course the film-closing helicopter scenes are even more gripping (I saw Cruise tell Jimmy Fellon on Friday evening that he (Cruise) trained 1 1/2 years for these scenes.... The support cast is terrific all around. Ving Rhames, Rebecca Ferguson, Alec Baldwin all do a great job. But in the end it's all about Cruise, and his determination to win you over, he simply will not take no for an answer. Bottom line: \"Mission Impossible - Fallout\" in my mind has reset the modern day gold standard for action movies, and in fact it's now a platinum standard. Thank you Mr. Cruise & Co., job well done, and then some.\"Mission Impossible - Fallout\" opened wide this weekend. The Sunday early evening where I saw this at here in Cincinnati was pretty much a sell-out. The movie grossed over $60 mill in its opening weekend (not counting the rest of the world). Given that this movie will undoubtedly generate positive word of mouth, I see this having long legs at the box office, and deservedly so. \"Mission Impossible - Fallout\" is a WINNER.",

            "content": "Let's just say that it's the most dangerous and hard mission from all the six movies. The movie is called mission impossible and bringing that picture in that way was really \"impossible\" too. but that doesn't mean that there is no\n\"fall out\" in it.\nFirst, I respect so much the movie and how the makers made every stunt despite how dangerous it is very real. The reality in almost everything in the movie is it's true reason for success and entertainment and that's what cinema is for, To sacrifice to make a life in the form of a movie. The stunts in the movie and the cinematography are tremendous, extraordinary and unbelievable. Tom Cruise is of course the true hero in it with his extremely dangerous stunts that exceeds the professional level along with the great director Christopher McQuarrie with a powerful direction that brought the whole picture together. The music written for the film is pretty awesome like the ones you hear in Nolan's films by Zimmer that gives you the most authentic feeling of the movie as a combination of the movie's original score with the tense tones added to it just superb. The screenplay and the story were awesome too but the \"fall out\" was that the story is just full of playing games every couple of scenes you discover a new game that was a showoff of how they are doing the movie with much work and intelligence. The presence of Luther Stickell in the field seemed that they just must put him in the movie which would cost all the mission and is not helpful in anything than his experience with technology. Also Mark Cavill role was quite predictable but he was the star of the film in the performance. The performance of the others was almost good but I felt that the movie is centered and cared more about the reality of the stunts that you sometimes think of the other roles that they can be performed by anyone and wouldn't feel a difference especially Rebecca's whose character which I felt wasn't necessary to bring her again to the film and wasn't even big enough but for a couple of \"action scenes\" which could have been done by any other character or even not. The movie is very intense , entertaining and I was on the edge of my seat watching it. But always knowing how the movie will end and the luck in some of the stunts and scenes along with the absence of injury and the very last ending scene of the chase scene of this film which I felt wasn't quite real was just written and done without adding the whole touch of reality as in the whole movie was a little bit annoying for me. But overall, The movie is a masterpiece and reviews are for critic purposes always. Just enjoy the film and entertain yourself and absolutely don't miss it. 9/10\nbut as a fan the film is 10/10.",

(Perhaps he is old now, otherwise, Ethan used to hang with one hand from canyons for an incredible long shot).First time in the series, the movie opens without a bang, rather with a THUDD and from that's where the torture begins. Please don't watch it if you think you want to live with the great memories of great prequels, where ethan actually pulled off impossibilities.

Forget ever-changing, overly-serious Jack Ryan. Forget forgetful, mirthless Bourne. Ethan Hunt is my spy idol. And with Fallout, McQuarrie and Cruise have delivered easily their most impossible (and best) mission yet. A globe trekking, twisting-and-turning, intensely exciting sequel that continues and expands the reigning power of this unlikely blockbuster franchise.\nOnce again, Hunt and his crew find themselves amid a potential global disaster, on the outs with their own government and the criminal underground. What sets this one apart is its story and plot connections with the previous films. Where the others are essentially stand-alone outings, letting you jump in where you please, this one requires you to have a modicum of knowledge on Hunt and his exploits, allowing for growth in characters and stronger stakes in the villain's mysterious plots. \nAs expected, there are an endless number of great reveals that beautifully unravel information only when necessary. Thanks to some stellar editing, it's predictable when it isn't important, and unpredictable when it is, making the mysteries and the marquee action scenes that much more impacting.\nHonestly, God bless Tom Cruise and his lack of self-preservation. At 52, he is one of the last true action stars who sells a movie purely by putting his name on it, thanks largely to his renown for doing his own action. And with bathroom fist fights, helicopter chases, and skydiving malfunctions, what action it is. I always think this should be the last Mission with Cruise before seeing the most recent outing; by the end I just want more.",

            "content": "Review:\nAlthough the action scenes are top class, and the stunts are amazing, this movie just seemed like another Tom Cruise action film to me. The storyline was half decent, even though the director overcomplicated it with technical jargon, and it was good to see the original cast back. After watching the bonus material, I don't think you can appreciate the work that goes into making one of these movies, especially with Cruise doing most of the stunts, and the director could have easily used a green screen for a lot of the locations, which he decided against. My problem with the film is the fact that it's not that different from the rest of the Mision Possible movies. It's just Cruise pushing the bar when it comes to the various stunts, including learning to fly a helicopter for this film. Don't get me wrong, it's still worth a watch if you're into your epic action films but I'm personally getting a bit fed up with Cruise running, jumping, and driving every vehicle made. After his amazing performance in Tropic Thunder, which a lot of people rated him for, I think it's about time Cruise stopped saving the day, against all odds. Anyway, two years after Solomon Lane's (Sean Harris) capture, the remnants of his organisation, The Syndicate, have reorganised as a rogue terrorist group called the Apostles. IMF agent Ethan Hunt (Tom Cruise) is assigned to buy three stolen plutonium cores in Berlin before the Apostles can. He is joined by Benji Dunn (Simon Pegg) and Luther Stickell (Ving Rhames) for the mission, but the team fails when Luther is taken hostage and Ethan's attempt to save him allows the Apostles to make off with the plutonium. Furious at IMF's failure to secure the plutonium, CIA Director Erica Sloane (Angela Bassett) instructs Special Activities Division operative August Walker (Henry Cavill) to shadow Ethan, as he attempts to retrieve the plutonium. I think you can guess where the movie goes from here! Basically, Ethan and his team go through hell to try and retrieve the plutonium, which they lost at the beginning of the film. With the help of MI6 agent IIsa Faust (Rebecca Ferguson), who saves Ethan's life a few times during the movie, their information finally leads them to a medical camp in Kashmir, were Ethan's estranged wife Julia (Michelle Monaghan) is working. The team deduces that Solomon and August are actually working together and that they plan to detonate the nuclear weapons over the Siachen Glacier, contaminating the water supply of Pakistan, India and China, with a third of its population affected, the world will descend into anarchy from which Solomon and August hope a new world order will emerge. Now you know why I said that the director overcomplicated the plot! Basically, some nutter wants to blow up half the world, so Ethan and his team have to stop him. Personally, I thought that there were way too many characters in the film, and the action went on forever. You can see where every penny of the budget went, especially as they shot in real locations but I would have liked more character building, and some wit to lighten the mood. It is non-stop from the beginning to the end which, in some ways, becomes a bit claustrophobic after a while. We all know that Ethan is going to save the day, once again, and after many years of saving the world, the stupid CIA Director still thought that he went rogue, which I thought was ridiculous. Anyway, I think that Tom Cruise has done every stunt known to man by now, so I think it's time for him to hang up his \"adrenaline junkie\" shoes, and try something new to entertain audiences. Watchable!Round-Up:\nThis movie was written and directed by Christopher McQuarrie, who also brought you The Way of the Gun, which I really enjoyed, Jack Reacher and Mission Impossible: Rogue Nation. He also produced Valkyrie and Jack Reacher: Never Go Back, and he wrote the Usual Suspects, The Way of the Gun, Valkyrie, The Tourist, Jack Reacher, Jack The Giant Slayer, Edge Of Tomorrow, Mission Impossible: Rogue Nation and The Mummy which also starred Tom Cruise. McQuarrie and Cruise have built a healthy relationship over the years, which is why they produce some of the most extravagant stunts seen in film. It might also explain why most of Tom Cruise's films are similar to each other, and we always have the famous running scene, which gets on my nerves. With another Top Gun in the pipeline, which is also being directed by McQuarrie, Tom Cruise is definitely a true Hollywood star, and he is still got the audiences flocking to the cinema, judging by the profit that this movie made. After the terrible, The Mummy, I did think that people had enough of Cruise's action blockbusters but this movie has proved that one bad movie won't tarnish his name. As this is the 7th highest-grossing film of 2018, which is Cruise's highest-grossing film to date, and the highest-grossing film in the franchise, I'm sure the MI franchise isn't over, even though Cruise is 56 years old.Budget: $178million\nWorldwide Gross: $791millionGenre: Action, Adventure, Thriller\nCast: Tom Cruise, Henry Cavill, Ving Rhames, Simon Pegg, Rebecca Ferguson, Sean Harris, Angela Bassett, Michelle Monaghan, Wes Bentley, Alec Baldwin, Vanessa Kirby and Frederick Schmidt. 5/10",

That being said, the bathroom fight before meeting her at the club was brilliant. Finishing off the film, the climactic 15-minute countdown was the most captivated I have been in film in a long time. I was glued to the screen! In addition, bringing back Ethan's wife Julia was a perfect conclusion to her character's story arc. Rather than have an ambiguous end to her story, she is given a new beginning. Not only that, but she cleared Ethan's conscious and allowed him to move forward with Ilsa and the IMF.",

This movie has the typical plot twists but does them in what I thought to be a somewhat unique way. They did push the bait and switch twist moments right up to the line of where it would have been ridiculous and possibly too hard to follow though. I give major credit for Cruise performing most of the stunts for this film and opting to do many scenes in camera instead of CGI and green screen, it adds so much depth that many action films lack due to studios leaning too much on advanced CGI technology. The last thing I'd like to praise is the continuity of characters, Fallout does a great job by not introducing us to a plethora of new characters. His team, some of his enemies, and his wife remain the same across most MI films which is great to see. The cinematography was also quite nice, some unique shots and camera work over the major cities. The run-time was a little long but pacing was okay up until the last thirty minutes, but that was my only issue I'd say.I'd recommend checking it out! 8.5/10",

Honestly, I may have only enjoyed this film as much as I did because he was in it, but it did also feel like all of the other films had been building up to this one. It was the Daddy of the series so far and definitely my favourite. It seemed to have found its footing and learned its place in the world of cinema. I didn't feel that it was competing with 'James Bond' or 'Jason Bourne' this time. Ethan Hunt (Tom Cruise) and the MFI team were worthy in their own right.The acting was all good, with the possible exception of Ving Rhames, who came across as a bit of an old woman and I wondered if his character, Luther may have become a little bit obsolete now, he was also a tad corny too.I also thought that Simon Pegg had found an appropriate place in the cast, with a good balance for his comedic contributions to match this chapter. He wasn't quite as strong an agent as he had been previously though and could almost have been considered a liability at times - More of \"The guy in the chair\" than a field man, but it wasn't in a really annoying way, like one of those female characters from years ago that always fell over their high heels, whilst running from bad guys or monsters, before film makers realised that women weren't actually useless.Tom's hair was much better in this one and he looked younger too, so I didn't feel that he might want to hang up his stunt performing muscles, as I had with the last instalment. His hero complex did feel as if it was getting a bit much though, I'd like to see him let others have a chance at things once or twice.His character definitely had a type though, apart from The White Widow (Vanessa Kirby) the girls all looked the same.Actually, Vanessa Kirby, was very sexy in this one and I'm a gay! I'd witnessed her performance as Princess Margaret in 'The Crown' (2016-) and always appreciated it, but she really had a special zestiness in this film. I think that she should go far in TV and film, with whatever she puts her mind to.I even liked Alec Baldwin in this one, having hated him in 'Rogue Nation' (2015). He seemed to have built on his role properly and calmed the ham down to fit in well with the rest of the team.I did find myself lacking trust in the cast this time around, but not in the bad way, where there were too many people to choose from and it got complicated, but in a good way that had me second guessing the few relevant potentials, without distracting my thoughts from the main flow of things.I definitely felt the tension more in this one than I had been. I felt myself leaning forward in the chair to see what would happen next.It was a long film though, so be prepared to sit still for a long time.If the next two are anything like this one, then they will be something to look forward to.844.04/1000.",

I've always seen it as the American version of the 'Bond' films, and I've always been of the opinion that 'Bond' was superior. 'Mission Impossible - Fallout' however was far and away the best entry in the series. They finally nailed it.The action in this movie is relentless. It starts immediately and never lets up. There was a point where two characters were talking for maybe 2 minutes and I actually thought to myself: boy it's been a long time without an action sequence. That's how fast paced this film is. The two and a half hour run time is gone by in the snap of your fingers. Also the action sequences aren't just plentiful, they are of the highest quality too. Every stunt is incredible to watch.This film is smart too. So often it caught me off guard with just how clever it was able to be. The story is incredibly well thought out and some particular scenes and even just moments are bordering on genius. Tom Cruise also proves that he still has it. He has infinite charm and is endlessly watchable. The only negative I found in the film was that the helicopter scenes (filmed in my beloved and beautiful New Zealand) were probably the weakest of all the action sequences. So to have them be the last ones seen in the film ended the movie on not quite the high I would have liked. Otherwise though this is an excellent film that you should rush out and see if you haven't already.",

I honestly wouldn't be surprised if that's how they put together their plot in the first place, nevertheless, as a result, the plot has gone to the point of even turning off certain percentage of brain will still not prevent you from thinking it as completely ridiculous and preposterous.If you just want to enjoy endless awesome action of top notch production value and visual, this movie wont disappoint, but if you're also looking forward to a story, like the ones in Edge of Tomoorow, Jack Reacher, etc, dont even bother.",

If one hasn't seen the most recent M:I movie (Rogue Nation), then this movie will be very difficult to follow. Anyway, if I had to name one overarching problem with this entry, it would be the obviousness; at this point in the series, if Ethan and pals are up against a wall, chances are good that the wall will lead to a hidden cache of weapons. Metaphorically speaking, anyway. Great stunts include a high-altitude, low opening jump; Cruise piloting a disabled helicopter over mountainous terrain; and a race through the streets of Paris on motorbikes. And yes, it's nice to see someone who doesn't have super powers save the day, but one gets the impression that Ethan Hunt can do things simply because he thinks he can. Don't try this at home.",

This film is immensely exciting.\nSpeaking of Wick. Even Keanu will have to turn it up a notch as I believe Christopher McQuarrie's movie has raised the bar.\nJust as The Bourne Identity pushed James Bonds rebirth with Daniel Craig in Casino Royale, Fallout renders all other action movies as watered down pretenders.With a fantastic supporting cast\nand a brilliant turn from Henry Cavill, Fallout is one of the best blockbusters of the summer.\nFrom fisticuffs to car chases to dangling from a helicopter both Cruise and McQuarrie don't let the audience catch their breath.\nEven with some nice comedic touches from Simon Pegg it's the action that really drives this movie.\nIt looks fantastic, it sounds fantastic and delivers as a perfect summer popcorn treat.I don't know if Cruise can top this one.

Mission: Impossible: Fallout is the best movie in the franchise, and one of (if not the) best action movies in recent memory.In a sea of mediocre and uninspired action movies, Christopher McQuarrie managed to keep the genre tense and exciting.My main gripe with the previous instalments of the franchise is that Ethan Hunt felt too invincible. Even though he was constantly doing dangerous stunts, I always knew he'd eventually get back up. All the way throughout this movie, I feared for his life.Throughout the course of the film, Ethan Hunt is constantly misjudging his situation and making mistakes. This not only humanises Ethan, but it also makes us think that he may actually be capable of death. All throughout his climactic battle with Walker, I thought that he would make that fatal mistake that leads to his downfall. Of course, this never takes place, as the franchise is simply too lucrative to axe the main character. That doesn't take away the fact that the movie managed to make me believe that Ethan Hunt may in fact die.The highlight of this movie is undoubtedly Lane's effect on Ethan due to the effects of Rogue Nation. Because of the events of that film, most notably the threat to kill one of Ethan's best friends, Benji Dunn. This event leads to Ethan to decide to jeopardise his mission in order to save one of his friends, Luther Stickell, early on in the film.This not only proves Ethan's loyalty to his team, but also arises suspicion to his intentions, which allows Walker to propose the theory that Ethan may have turned against IMF to the CIA. All of this makes Lane an excellent villain, showing how he can break down Ethan's psyche while doing very little.Even though the film contains staples of the franchise, such as the masks, unrealistic technology and crazy stunts, the film feels like a breath of fresh air to the franchise, making me excited for the 7th movie.",

W/gaps as long as 6 years between entries and sporting a catalog of directors whose styles could not be more different, it doesn't have the precise, lab tested and exhaustively vetted formula of something like the Marvel Cinematic Universe, yet here it stands 22 years after the release of its first entry stronger and more vibrant than ever. The same can be said of its star. One of my biggest gripes w/the M:I series has been that the character of Ethan Hunt really isn't a character at all. What's his personality? His quirks and vices? If I asked you to describe James Bond's personality you could do it easily despite him having been played by a growing roster of actors under the pen of a legion of writers. Ethan Hunt? He's just kind of an avatar for Tom Cruise. What Fallout does is finally begin to rectify that a bit by giving us some dramatic carryover from previous films. It gives Ethan and his world another--and desperately needed--dimension. But you don't go see an unabashed popcorn extravaganza like Mission: Impossible for drama, you go for the thrills, and they're here aplenty. There story is a bit thin, but it's well told and a solid enough vessel to hold our interest and make us care about the white-knuckle action. Cruise famously does his own stunts, and that's not just a gimmick for the sales pitches. Director Christopher McQuarrie puts us right there w/Cruise and the result is action that feels palpable. Too often massive, CGI-filled action set pieces are impressive to behold, but lack that tactile sense that Cruise and McQuarrie bring to the proceedings here. Here you don't feel like you're watching someone else in danger, you feel like you're in danger w/them.The mission here, should you choose to accept it, is have fun. Thanks to Cruise and company, it's once again mission accomplished.",

            "content": "I went into 'MI: Fallout' hoping that the movie would continue in the vein of the two prior films - 'Ghost Protocol' and 'Rogue Nation' - which I thought were both great.To sum up how I felt when leaving the theater last night in one word, that word would be: disappointed. However, I left feeling just as baffled by most of the design choices made in this movie. (That said, the one thing that I actually really did enjoy was the fight choreography during the sequence that took place in the men's restroom near the beginning of the film which I thought was pretty fun.)I felt like this film abandoned the cool, sleek, and sexy M.O. of the two prior movies in favor of over-the-top, balls-to-the-wall action in a vaguely similar vein to the tonal shift when they went from MI1 to MI2.The film really begins to go off rails after the first act by overcomplicating the plot by having an ADDITIONAL character - other than the double agent working against the US that the audience has already been informed of - to seemingly double-cross the IMF, rehashing chase scenes that we've not only seen before, but seen in THIS very movie before, and in the later half of the movie (MAJOR SPOILER AHEAD) by having Alec Baldwin's character fight against Henry Cavill's character (that's right, you read that correctly... Alec Baldwin's character fights, albeit briefly, Henry Cavill's character in this movie). By the final act, the movie just turns into a parody of itself. Half of the people in theater I was in last night were laughing AT the film and NOT with the film at regular intervals during the last act, because what was being shown and said made so little sense. (i.e. By pure chance Ethan serendipitously meets his ex-wife Julia at a camp in the middle of nowhere b/c she just happened to become a doctor and wound up volunteering at the very medical camp where the nuclear bombs that Hunt's team have been chasing all across the globe the entire movie happened to be deployed to. The pacing and the tone shift with Ethan and team when he bumps into Julia is just mind-boggling as we watch Ethan's team stand idly by in the background while he and Julia have a conversation while everyone in the audience knows that in mere minutes two nuclear bombs in the immediate vicinity will be detonated unless they do something to prevent that from happening.)A poor plot, and not forgetting to mention some lackluster acting, and the numerous spy/action film tropes and clich\u00e9s aside, the movie was too cheesy and overly dramatic to boot. One scene that illustrates this, is the scene where Cavill's character, being chased by Hunt, gets away on a helicopter leaving Hunt behind standing on top of a tower in London while blaringly loud, overly dramatic orchestra music plays in the background ALTHOUGH Hunt wasn't ever even close to catching up with Cavill's character during the chase in the first place. Jarring stuff. And really, 'jarring' is the word that I'm looking for here in describing this movie. There were WAYYY too many scenes in this movie that simply snapped me out of the immersion/enjoyment of the film b/c they were either wayyy too cheesily written/acted OR because they were too silly and implausible.All of this resulted in a rather forgettable and bad MI movie IMO. That said, I hope that they're able to get the franchise back on track when MI8 inevitably is released.",

His routes or his opponents routes would always meet, no matter what criss cross wherever or whereabout. It's like both of the Hunt team and the bad guys have done a rehearsal beforehand, so every route, every means of escapes and chases have already been synchronized and agreed to both sides. What a load of crap.So since all scenes are just so ridiculously convenient and/or so conveniently ridiculous, I just felt so disconnected by so many ridiculousnesses and conveniences. I really don't know how people would swallow these ridiculous scenarios and readily convenient scene after scene. Why you guys so conveniently to accept such ridiculousnesses? The whole movie just looked and felt so obviously fake. Why you have to use ground surface roads to deliver the prisoner, why not use the chopper to transport the prisoner? Then when they first time dropped the prisoner on the rooftop under the sun, in the broad daylight, why those two special force guys (French? British? Or U.S.? Well, who cares) would wear night-vision goggles on their helmets? Then the next scene, these guys' helmets got no goggles at all. That's ridiculous! Some cast should be replaced sooner than later. I don't know why Tom Cruise chose Ving Rhames and Simon Pegg to play two key supporting roles in this franchise. Ving Rhames didn't look a bit like a computer genius, a guy who just looked out of place, too old and too ugly like a toad, he and Danny Trejo are the two ugliest dudes on the big silver screen or PC monitor so repellent to look at and, Simon Pegg, nothing but a totally unnecessary comic figure, a British clown. If Cruise decides to keep this Mission: Impossible for another one or two sequels, he should replace these two inappropriate cast right away, because these two guys didn't fit at all in a serious thriller franchise.This time, after the gunfight in the tunnel(?), Ethan Hunt seemed to have an earlier symptom of dementia, he totally forgot what he came for. He's totally lost and the sudden disappearance of the nuclear case was just absurd.The whole movie just felt so conveniently ridiculous, so ridiculous that only made me feel numb and disconnected, just like watching a video game adapted from a ridiculous comic book.",

            "content": "Turns out the Syndicate hasn't been disbanded, but the remaining rogue agents call themselves The Apostles and aim to bring terror and death the world over. To do so they aim to acquire plutonium. Our team is about to purchase that plutonium but they are outsmarted by the Apostles a shootout ensues and the bad guys make it away with the material because no one from the team bothers to grab the case. But our team manage to grab and deceive some guy who build nuclear weapons for the Apostles. Now our team at least has the design of the weapons. No one at the CIA has happy with this so it decides to have a agent Walker join out team. They go to a party in Paris where some guy is going to buy the plutonium. They intercept and impersonate the guy, not after a cool martial arts-fight scene, and also the lovely Ilsa Faust is back. Ethan makes contact with the broker but the deal now involves having to rescue bad guy Solomon Lane. Our team doesn't follow the script but instead has its own plan to grab Lane. But Ilsa also has an agenda. There are a couple of surprises and Lane ends up in Kashmir with the bombs where he plans to contaminate the water supply of a bunch of countries. Our team also ends up there where Ethan\u00b4s wife is as well for some reason. They have to disactivate the bombs in time while Ethan has to get the detonator from the villain.Mission: Impossible - Fallout is awfully long, with a complex story, which I suspect doesn't quite make sense in the end. Cavill does a good job, Ferguson is lovely as always. The team is noticeably one team member short. This movie takes itself a bit too seriously, there's little humor, and little dialogue. We are not privy to any planning like in previous MIs but stuff happens and we find out what\u00b4s what when the deceived do. There's the usual globe trotting but we don't get to see much of the places. The final scenes in New Zealand playing Kashmir look pretty amazing. This movie is entertaining enough but something is missing and it's hard to tell what. Again, it's too long so at the end you can't keep track of things. We don't get much of a break from the action. Some of the action is pretty good, some isn't, Cruise gets to do his favorite thing, run around. Not quite sure what everyone else found in this movie, it's alright but I didn't find it as good as the previous two.",

            "content": "GRADE: B THIS FILM IS RECOMMENDED.IN BRIEF: Mission improbable, but great fun due to the expert stunt work and fine action sequences. JIM'S REVIEW: Mission Impossible: Fallout is a circus act of death-defying stunts surrounded by espionage plots, double crosses, and enough action sequences to idle one's time. The film is is full throttle non-stop excitement with many hand-to-hand combat scenes, high flying leaps (of logic and otherwise), and speedy motorcycle chases and car crashes, which would certainly kill or, at least, cripple the common man. But this is no common person on that big screen. It is the ne'er aging Tom Cruise, a spry 56 years of age, playing action hero Ethan Hunt who engages us in most of the his risky business. It is a very physically demanding role and the actor is very convincing and should be the official poster boy for AARP.Much is made of Mr. Cruise's uncanny ability to do his own stunts. Kudos to him on that physical talent. Yet no one questions if he does his own acting. He mostly runs fast, drives hard, and delivers a few lines with the utmost sincerity. His stoic character, as written, is rather bland but he has a colorful crew of supporting figures that provide conflict and interest. Once again, he has his loyal IMF sidekicks, Luther and Benji (Ving Rhames and Simon Pegg), love interests Isla and Julia (Rebecca Ferguson and Michelle Monaghan), a femme fatale named White Widow (Vanessa Kirby), and the complimentary evil villain (Sean Harris). Mr. Cruise also has some competition (both acting wise and stunt wise in the manly form of Henry Cavil as Agent Walker. There is a nice anti-chemistry between them.The plot involves lost plutonium and preventing global annihilation via nuclear bombs, this time from a terrorist group called the Apostles. It all grows more complicated and far-fetched as the story progresses, but logic is rarely achieved in these spy capers. No, it's the set pieces of high energy happenings and dare-doing that one comes to see. And while the plot twists aren't very inventive, nor are they remotely surprising, this film delivers that comfort food for action junkies big time.Credit director Christopher McQuarrie and his expert team of stunt performers for their well-staged choreography and the taut editing by Eddie Hamilton. Mr. McQuarrie knows how to effectively layer his cliffhangers and build suspense and tension skillfully. (The fight sequence in the porcelain white bathroom is classic, and the helicopter chase ranks up there too.) The film is strongly crafted entertainment for the masses. And who doesn't love hearing that classic Lalo Schifrin's 60's television theme punctuating Lorne Balfe's lively score.But no matter how filmmakers update this spy caper with all of the state-of-the-art techno-CGI wizardry, the basic plot is borderline tiresome. The director's script is loaded with more than a smattering of cinematic cliches: double agents, globe-trotting to international cities, absurd running and jumping from windows and rooftops, frenzied car chases against incoming traffic. It's all there, right down to the timed ticking of that activated bomb showdown we have seen in so many countless thrillers as it goes down to the very last second till possible doomsday.This crowd pleasing film series will keep going and going due to its satisfying and memorable action work. Despite its narrative flaws, Mission Impossible: Fallout, the sixth installment in this franchise, becomes a i mission accomplished, improbably well done.",

They got us fast-paced, real stunts curtesy of the dare-devil Cruise, a plot that is full of twists and turns, and a team of characters that are fun and exciting to watch.\nThe direction was beautiful. Christopher McQuarrie has built a very good relationship with Cruise over the many films they have collaborated on together. He is able to capture intense action scenes in a way that is very clear but one that takes a fresh style on the approach. We have seen fistfights, jumping out of a plane, and motorcycle chases countless times before, so instead of sticking to what we know and giving the audience what they are expecting, McQuarrie brought a new fresh take on how to make these scenes stick out from the rest in a beautiful way. He relies heavily on the rule of thirds which almost immediately in my opinion makes scenes more captivating and allows them to breath and not be bogged down in the center. \nI could talk about his brilliant decisions all day, but he wasn't the only one who exceled in the movie. The cast was fantastic as well, bring an ensemble look to the series that hasn't fully been there at times. The series has really progressed from a Tom Cruise centric film to one that now is just an action thriller that will use every character almost equally to achieve the goal. Yes, at times the plot doesn't quite live up the thriller category but it is consistently close enough.",

            "content": "The best blockbuster film of the summer. It takes all the elements people love about the franchise then dials it up to eleven.The action scenes and chases haven't been this exciting in an action film probably since its predecessor Rogue Nation. The HALO jump sequence is outstanding and a climactic helicopter chase is exhilarating. The gunfights and hand to hand combat is bone crunching. An extended action beat in a bathroom of all places is brutal and very well choreographed.The returning cast is great. The underrated actor Sean Harris doesn't disappoint as arch-villain Solomon Lane. Henry Cavill's CIA agent Walker is a good addition to the proceedings and Vanessa Kirby is having a ball as the femme fatale arms dealer White Widow.Christopher McQuarrie solidifies himself as one of the top action directors working today. Not only that, he knows how to weave it into a good story too. Now while I loved this movie, there are some things I should probably mention. I cannot go quite that far and call it the best in the series and one of the best blockbusters in years like Fury Road or the Dark Knight or even The Avengers movies. There are still things I just liked better in Ghost Protocol and Rogue Nation.Now that being said, this one does stand out from the other films for one reason. It feels genuinely epic, like a classy cinematic adventure from the 1960s. Like an older James Bond film; and this is far better than half the recent James Bonds for that matter.Again I like certain elements more in the earlier films but I dunno, it's more balanced here and the film really benefits from that. I mean, the editing and the pacing is top notch. Nothing feels unnecessary. It really reminded me of The Dark Knight in that senseI must sound confusing right now but don't worry, it remains an excellent well oiled thrill ride that is worth seeing in theaters.",

Most of the characters is not useful, no meaning and crucial factors in the film, just adding some new faces to make movie fresher. In brief, all the conspiracies in this film are contradictory and predictable, so it fails; most of the characters' existences are only for distracting the background, so the film seems to be more surprises, but it didn't work, it fail; the last thing, this film wants to combine box office and depth, so too much CGI and unnecessary plots inside, to the most reviewers it works, but I think that it ruins this classic series, and totally disappointing.",

The only acting standout was Vanessa Kirby, who lights things up as The White Widow.I have learned that a high, early score on IMDB is often misleading. Do studio hack writers get paid to write glowing reviews with 10/10 ratings? It's hard to believe good ratings for Hollywood blockbuster movies any longer.

There are a few moments where characters pull their faces off and reveal other characters underneath, and even one moment where the room the characters are in is actually a different kind of room.Nobody goes to see \"Mission: Impossible\" for that, though. You see it for action, which the previous, breathtaking movie delivered in spades. It was one of the best movies of the year it came out, and definitely one of the best action movies of the decade so far. So what of this sequel, \"Fallout\"?Unfortunately, it's a bit underwhelming. There are no memorable action moments like in the previous movie. It jumps around a lot, which is less exciting than tiresome. Sean Harris is a great bad guy, but he's barely in it.\"Mission: Impossible - Fallout\" feels like a collection of scenes that weren't good enough to go in the previous movies.",

But Cavill surprised me with a rather charismatic performance as Aganet Walker. A particular highlight of the film was the halo jump scene, which was simply breathtaking.However the third act drags and brings back a character from the previous film that was unnecessary and out of nowhere.

            "content": "Mission: Impossible - Fallout (2018): 9 out of 10. The Bond series has been flaying around bleeding in the water for years and no action franchise has taken bigger chunks out of it than Mission Impossible. (Fast and Furious is a close second).The Good: The recent main appeal of the Mission Impossible franchise is to watch the seemingly ageless space Jesus Tom Cruise attempt to kill himself in various ways. Mission Impossible: Fallout does not disappoint. While no particular stunt is as impressive as hanging on the side of an Airbus A400M Atlas while it takes off from the opening sequence in Mission Impossible Rogue Nation. ( Honestly my favorite stunt in any movie surpassing James Bond parachuting off the side of Mount Asgard in the opening scene of The Spy Who Loved Me. Of course, that was stunt double Rick Sylvester, not Roger Moore while all the Mission Impossible stunts seem to feature an unadulterated Tom Cruise.) The stunts in Mission Impossible Fallout are very impressive indeed.Strangely with all the impressive stunts (halo jumps, helicopter stunts, driving in Paris traffic), it was the bathroom fight scene that impressed me the most. ( Surpassing my previous favorite bathroom fight scene from the beginning of James Bond's Casino Royale... okay I will stop now) For one thing, it introduces the biggest surprise of the movie, a mustached Henry Cavill.I admit I never cared much for Henry Cavill. Of course, my only real experience was him as Superman in which he was awful. Well, that might not have been Henry's fault. In Fallout Henry Cavill is perfect. He plays his character so well you feel sorry for him and he is easily the most lovable thing in a movie with two puppy dog eyed sidekicks (Ving Rhames, Simon Pegg) and two puppy dog eyed love interests (Rebecca Ferguson, Michelle Monaghan ).The location shooting is also on point in Mission Impossible Fallout with a particular kudos for using all of Paris and not just the five-minute highlight tour. The movie has a very good sense of place and time and the plot is practically followable if we are grading on a curve that is previous Mission Impossible movies.The Bad: Supporting characters seem to be a chink in the armor of the Mission Impossible movies. Henry Cavill (lauded above) and Simon Pegg get an easy pass. On the villianish side, Vanessa Kirby as Lady Gaga and Sean Harris as the Unibomber both put in great work. I thought it was time for Luther (Ving Rhames) to retire in Rogue Nation and Fallout has not changed my mind (He seems more like a punch drunk kidnap victim rather than a highly trained agent).The love interests are a bit of a mess. Rebecca Ferguson is way to kittenish to be believable as an MI-6 agent that could turn on you at any moment and Michelle Monaghan comes across less than the love of Ethan Hunt's life and more like that college girlfriend who you dated before you met your wife and whose name you can't quite remember even though you lived together for eight months.My winner however for worst side character is Angela Bassett. Now Angela Bassett is a very talented actress but her character is horribly written and she doesn't help matters. It as if she saw Viola Davis' horrible performance in Suicide Squad and said \"I am going to do that\"The Ugly: There is someone missing on this outing. Unfortunately, Jeremy Renner was needed on the Avengers: Endgame set, presumably to get coffee for the actual heroes, and is replaced with a now demoted Alec Baldwin whose character is handwaved to have taken that demotion from the Director of the Central Intelligence Agency to Tom Cruise's fluffer because he believes in the team.There is a scene where Alec Baldwin has a fist fight with Henry Cavill. I am not sure what they were going for here? Drama, suspense, pathos? But I am sure that the actual reaction of OMG no followed by gales of laughter was not what the director Christopher McQuarrie was aiming for.In conclusion: A very solid and rewatchable film with tons of little touches and big moments and have not even spoken of in this review. Easily the best Mission Impossible movie so far and one of the best action films of the year.",

            "content": "Fallout packs a big punch of thrilling action set-pieces with an impressive performance led by Tom Cruise. There is a sense of tension always looming in the air. Right from the first scene, the film challenges the whole premise of Mission Impossible. While there have been past attempts to throw a unique twist to the long running franchise, it has not been done quite like this.This sixth instalment knows itself too well and plays to its advantages. As a movie primarily popular for its action set-pieces, Fallout redefines what it takes to be Mission Impossible. The main separating factor being the authentic showcase of stunt work, clever choreography and the ever non-ageing Tom Cruise. Be it jumping from C-17, a bike chase across Paris rush hour or simply men fighting in a bathroom; Tom Cruise delivers astoundingly with no intention of slowing down. At all times, Fallout remains pivoted to its story and the hurdles of Ethan Hunt (Tom Cruise) to save the world. The action scenes never seem to be in the movie for just \"action purposes\" and do have a valid reason for existing. The theme of pressure is one that this movie also encapsulates very well. The frame is always tight and focused on characters. This is furthered more by the darker than usual tones of the original score composed by Lorne Balfe. Having its fair share of bag of tricks, this film feels original while keeping its roots intact as a Mission Impossible movie.Fallout strikes the perfect balance between an action movie and a thriller, keeping the viewers' eyes wide open. Evidently one of the best action movies of the decade, Mission: Impossible Fallout is a refreshing and a much needed film which is worthy of its genre. Pure excitement and a must watch for action lovers and casual movie go-ers alike.",

It's hard to explain how this film made me feel. I wasn't really bored, but I wasn't in awe. For starters, the plot was too complicated. That's the problem with movies now. The story is either lazily written fluff or it's too much information for the viewer to understand.The action was fun at times (the Paris chase, for instance) but the thrill was quickly gone. It was nothing to talk about later. And it's nothing we haven't seen before. Trust me. If anything, it occasionally rips off other action movies.The acting performances where also mediocre. Tom Cruise was a bit hammy because all of his lines were. And it's hard to take Rebecca Ferguson seriously after 'The Greatest Showman.' I keep expecting her to burst into a cheesy pop song.

            "content": "Tom Cruise returns to ignite the screen in the sixth installment of the incredibly successful Mission Impossible franchise. I will be the first to admit, I liked most of the previous films, but never loved them. I always thought the James Bond or Jason Bourne franchise had the more interesting lore or characters. The stories of these Mission Impossible movies were never this interesting to me. So in conclusion, Mission Impossible for me was a more lackluster franchise that was held together simply by Tom Cruise's effort. Until now because Mission Impossible: Fallout is not only the best film of the franchise, but also one of the best Action movies I have ever seen! The trailers gave a little too much away in my opinion so if you are interested in seeing it, stay away from the trailers if you managed to avoid them this far. All I'll say is that Ethan Hunt (Tom Cruise) and his IMF team (Simon Pegg and Ving Rhames) have lost these plutonium capsules to a group named the Apostles. The rest of the film consists of the team trying to get back the plutonium. There are many twists and turns in Mission Impossible: Fallout that surprised me. Of course this is not a Tarantino script where nothing is predictable but I thought unlike the previous movies they really used the gadgets and lore of the franchise to the advantage of the story. Often in the James Bond films, 007 receives gadgets to escape from sticky situations. It removed suspense from certain scenes cause we know he'll simply press a button on his watch. Mission Impossible: Fallout has gadgets but uses them to Ethan Hunt's disadvantage. The use of them often led to twists I didn't expect. The story was certainly the most compelling of all these movies. So we have a solid story and it's accompanied by some of the best action sequences I have ever seen. Especially a scene involving a helicopter made my mouth drop. It is a mixture of solid suspenseful film making and a sense of wonderment as the audience is in awe at what Hunt is doing. Say about Tom Cruise, the person anything you want. But the quality he puts into these roles are incredible. He is 56 and has been a reliable movie star for over 3 decades and still learns how to fly a helicopter for the sixth Mission Impossible movie. This allows the director to make long wide shots of action. No shaky can or quick editing that makes one sea sick here. There are a few characters in this film that could have used a little more development. Especially Henry Cavill's character stuck out as a character that felt a little under-utilised. But besides this, Mission Impossible: Fallout is an incredible Action movie, filled with awesome performances by Tom Cruise, Simon Pegg, Rebecca Ferguson, Ving Rhames, Angela Basset, Alec Baldwin and Michelle Monaghan. A film that has some of the best and most thrilling action scenes ever filmed and a story that kept me genuinely intrigued. Overall blockbusters don't get better than this and easily beats Deadpool 2 as my favourite summer movie of 2018.",

As usual the film has its basic MI elements. Thrill, Top Class Action, Stylishness, Transmogrification of the team mates through masks, Real Cruise stunts. But the fact that this film is much better than its prequels is that not only this movie levels up its basic elements as mentioned above but also it adds another thing which makes this movie interesting and that is the acting performances of actors. Each and every actor in this movie has given justice to there roles. Henry Cavill is the right choice for these types of franchises. This film has saved the name of franchise and also the career of Tom. Unlike Fast and Furious ; MI relies solely on the shoulder of Cruise. It has to struggle to get a good collection at the box office. F & F has many elements that makes it a block buster but this is not the case for MI. Now a days, we have superhero genre to entertain us or the fantasy films. But these types of real action movies are fading in Hollywood. Thanks to MI that we are getting these movies. I will recommend everyone to watch this movie. It is my second most favourite MI film after Ghost Protocol. Do watch it.",

            "content": "After five installments, many would assume the Tom Cruise-starring 'Mission: Impossible' franchise would be on its last legs. In actuality, the latest effort - 'Mission: Impossible - Fallout' - is not just a hit with audiences, but also garnered critical acclaim, especially for a film of its genre.This time around, Ethan Hunt and his motley crew must track down and secure plutonium from the clutches of a mysterious terrorist group known as the Apostles before they can incite a nuclear holocaust. Sure, this plot sounds like it's done before by any combination of action films that have been churned out over the years, but it's not the \"what\" that makes 'Fallout' what it is. It's the \"how,\" as the film is well done.This is partly due to the all-star cast. From Hunt's partners in crime - Luther (Ving Rhames) and Benji (Simon Pegg) - to new faces - fellow agent August Walker (Henry Cavill) and Vanessa Kirby as the deceptively devious White Widow. And of course, Michelle Monaghan reprises her role as Hunt's ex-wife, while Rebecca Ferguson is the motorbike riding, sniping MI6 agent Ilsa Faust. Throw in Alec Baldwin and Angela Bassett as CIA bigwigs and a bonus cameo from Wolf Blitzer and you have yourself quite a cast of characters. Of course, there's no denying this is still the \"Cruise Show,\" as the A-lister consistently delivers, whether it's in doing his own stunts or giving convincing lines.In terms of other elements in 'Fallout,' there are plenty of ridiculously over the top scenes that are somewhat lol-worthy but also expected for this franchise. They don't feel as annoying now as they have seemed in previous installments. We also get to go on a world tour, everywhere from London to Paris to Kashmir, with your fair share of car chases, karate chops and skydives to go around. But what makes 'Fallout' stand out from others is the focus on values and personal fulfillment over \"just doing your job,\" as Hunt struggles with his relationship with Julia throughout the mission.There are no signs of Cruise slowing down anytime soon, and in 'Mission: Impossible - Fallout,' it's fair to say things are headed in the right direction.",

It is the pinnacle of the franchise; gripping, brisk, accessible and clever. Everything in my previous review stands verbatim. This is an excellently entertaining flick with everything firing in all cylinders against all odds.\nIt is a better film in every way than its predecessor. It carries its own unique voice despite being the same director as the last film. An action blockbuster is inherently flawed and so it must mask its flaws and perform greater, smarter feats to obfuscate and override its flaws and, like The Dark Knight before it, Fallout manages to do so.\nIt's running in clean, renewable creativity.\nImpossible Mission: You want me to say the Halo jump but while I find its addition into the picture to be pleasingly and shockingly sudden, the use of a CGI backdrop (storm) downplays the reality of it for me. Fallout may be the first in the franchise to have such forward momentum, thrust and its own blistering finale to catch up to, that it forgoes the trope of the big central mission. At a push I'd say the finale is exercised like a team mission, with everybody doing their part, a welcome addition of Monaghan's Julia, and IMAX footage of Cavill shooting a LMG at Tom Cruise flying a helicopter for real. It saved the best till last.\nRoll on Mission: Impossible 7 and Mission: Impossible: Infinity\nAn additional shoutout is needed for Lorne Balfe who managed to create an evocative and memorable score using the bongos from the first film, with a brilliant epic update to the theme, and like David Arnold's work in Casino Royale, also creates a new exciting theme, hopefully for all the rest of Mission.\nAnd in regards to the editing of the IMAX ratio shifts into the movie, I only noticed twice towards the end of the movie and couldn't believe how seamless and effective it was when compared to the eyesplitting nausea of something like the latest Transformers.",

            "content": "Every franchise has its ups and downs. Some very good movies, some bad movies, some more or less. But Tom Cruise has provided us with a sequence of impossible missions ever better than the other.In fact, there is no mystery to creating the films of the serie. It's a killer cake recipe that mixes absurd scenes, twists in the script, betrayals, a simple story explained right away (almost always the good guy has to stop the villain in his attempt to dominate or destroy the world), some surprises and Tom Cruise defying death.And every movie your Ethan Hunt seems to be over the edge. This is how we want it. This is how we like it.The great mystery even of \"Mission Impossible\" is like the 56 year old actor has the breath and willingness to do so much exercise! In \"Fallout Effect\", Tom Cruise runs UNBELIEFLY for London with rooftop jumps, stars in an impressive chase scene in the streets of Paris, pilots a helicopter and suffers an accident that would kill anyone in Kashmir. And still fight with Superman! All this having to climb a mountain at the end to save a third of the planet. China, India and Pakistan are grateful for their dedication.No wonder Luther (Ving Rhames) says, \"This is my man!\" \"Fallout Effect\" is that classic spy story Hunt style. There is a traitor in the agency, you have to find a terrorist, you have to prevent plutonium bombs from killing humanity. In the midst of all this, there is the Syndicate, a group of terrorists who have been demobilized since the arrest of Solomon Lane (Sean Harris).The situation in Washington is also not very good. The IMF is questioned after Ethan lets out the plutonium warheads to save his friends Luther and Benji (Simon Pegg). Because of this, the CIA decides to put the stick on the table and say \"now it's my way\". Thus, they recruit the mustachioed agent August Walker (Henry Cavill) to be Hunt's shadow and act more assertively on the mission.From there the plot develops in that climate everyone distrusts everyone. Even more so after Ilsa Faust (Rebecca Ferguson) comes full of mysteries saying she can not say anything, she can not say anything. \"But trust me.\" Ilsa, this is a world of spies. You do not even trust the shade.\"Mission Impossible: Fallout Effect\" is guaranteed fun and keeps the Ethan Hunt franchise alive. It remains to be seen how Tom Cruise will be able to take risks in ever more surreal scenes. Especially since each film seems to have to set new limits. Or keep the previous ones.",

            "content": "This movie kicked so much ass that by the end of the film it felt like Tom Cruise had personally been spanking me. And I loved every second of it.Before I fully start this review I would like to take time out of your busy schedule to say that the review for this film written in The New York Times is one of the most pretentious things I've ever read. You might be wondering why I'm bringing this up, but just read this quote from their review: \"The setup doesn't fully work and could be read as an example of gay panic rather than a swat at it.\" What? This quote too, boggles the mind: (keep in mind, this quote is discussing an action scene that happens in a bathroom with Tom, Henry Cavill, and another man) \"The setting and Mr. Cavill's pornstache and strapping masculinity invest the scene with titillating possibility: Is this an operation or a hookup?\" What the fu*k is this guy talking about? Did the writer seriously expect Tom, Henry, and the other man to start making out and have a threesome in the bathroom stall? I mean really, I've never read a more pretentious review in my entire life - who in their right mind would ever read THAT MUCH into an action scene (one of the best action scenes I've ever seen in my entire god damn life!) that takes place in a men's bathroom? Regardless, now that I've gotten that off my chest I feel much more relaxed and ready to jump right into this review that you've probably stopped reading. For some reason, I was skeptical walking into this film; I just really didn't think they would be able to make yet another amazing action film. Let' s be honest, the third, fourth, and fifth \"Mission Impossible\" movies were incredible, thrilling, white-knuckle movies, so when it came to \"Fallout,\" the sixth installment in the series, I really thought they wouldn't be able to strike gold again. But you know what? They did it!\"Fallout\" has some of the most thrilling action sequences put to film, and I'm not exaggerating. And you know what really sells every single god damn action scene? TOM MOTHERFUC*ING CRUISE. The man is a legend. Some people may think it's ridiculous that he insists on doing all his own stunts, but the only ridiculous thing that him doing his own stunts causes is ridiculously amazing action scenes. There's a scene where he jumps out of an airplane, and I was like \"pfft yea right he did that\" but he DID IT and the film SHOWS IT in ONE TAKE. God, I was seriously shaking in ecstasy, my jaw dropped, and my grandma walked out of the theater because she was so embarrassed I decided to wear a hot pink beanie (after the movie my grandma literally took me aside and told me I needed to dress more conservatively or people will think I'm gay, oh grandma). But Tom doesn't stop at jumping out of planes. He stops at nothing.I don't want to get into any real specifics as to what other action scenes you will see in this film entail because I would like to avoid spoilers as much as possible since this is a new release at the time of this writing, but I really do want to emphasize how incredible the action is. Every set piece is going to have you holding your breath and gripping the person next to you. The fights are brutal, clearly filmed with gorgeous wide-shots, and the choreography is pretty much perfection - I haven't seen such gorgeous fight choreography since \"The Raid.\"And not just the direction of the action scenes, but the direction of the entire movie is really stunning. There are certain scenes that, coupled with the fantastic soundtrack, feel like they could be right out of a Nicolas Winding Refn film (watch for the scene where Tom Cruise is surrounded by men in black masks, but he himself does not have one on, you'll know it when you see it). And speaking of music, there are certain times where the music cuts out when something intense is happening, and all that does is add to the visceral quality of the movie. I really wish my writing abilities were better so I could fully convey my feelings, but please just take my word for it and better yet go experience it for yourself. It would also be criminal for me not to mention how super duper sexy White Widow is. There's a scene where her and Tom lock lips and I almost cried out of jealousy. Okay fine, I admit I really didn't have to mention how attractive White Widow is but my God, I practically fell in love so Vanessa Kirby, if by some chance you're reading this, I will literally take you out to dinner and a movie, I'm not sure if you've seen the new \"Mission Impossible\" or not but you'll love it, give me a call. 8/10",

Tom Cruise is cool again. Mission Impossible gets it right with its storyline. It's the best part of the movie series and also the best action movie of the year.The story here moderates all the drama unlike the other Mission Impossible films. The action is the real deal in these films. Throughout the movie is all about the plans, escapes, and thrills. The subplots were little, which is good. The best thing about here is the focus. Keeps things moving. Every sequences are innovating and exciting. The building climbing scene and the running through the sandstorm scene are both ridiculously exciting.The actors are the gravy to the action.Tom Cruise proves that he is still an awesome actor. He makes all the action compellingly fun.Rebecca Ferguson is a good female backup. Cavill and Simon Pegg gives plenty of personality to their roles and makes a good comic relief. The villains are just being villains. The praise goes to the director, Christopher McQuarrie. His animated films proves that he can be a great action movie director. Here, he makes all of the action crazy and fun. Puts jokey feeling in some parts, it fits perfectly to the absurdity. The thrills are also there and always there.

            "content": "I've been a casual fan of the series for years and even though there are a few flaws in this chapter it is a personal favourite of mine now and it's turned me into a hardcore fan. When most films get past their 3rd chapter they often run out of ideas and usually make fun of themselves. Take for example franchises like Fast & Furious, Terminator, Die Hard and Death Wish. But the Mission Impossible franchise is one where they improve with each one. They are on the 6th instalment now and even though it retreads a little bit its still full of new ideas and some surprises along the way. Apart from the goofy Mission Impossible 2 this is a near perfect franchise. Tom Cruise is a very committed actor who always does the majority of his own stunts. He raises the bar here performing a HALO jump, dangling off helicopters, doing his own driving (and piloting) and running across rooftops. Also being the producer he does a great job overseeing the wellbeing of the series hiring talented writers/directors like JJ Abrams, Brad Bird and Christopher McQuarrie who have each brought their own fresh ideas to the films respectively.McQuarrie returns as director/co-writer and he really knows how to push performances from his actors while directing some breathtaking action scenes. It's the most action packed entry but not to the point where it defies the laws of physics. Each action scene feels somewhat grounded, they are well shot and edited with some bone crunching sound effects. They don't just rely on CGI fight sequences but instead focus on old fashioned stunts and car chases that remind us of the great action films of the 80s and 90s. One of the great things about this series is the cool gadgets (something the Bond franchise has been lacking in recent years) even though the technology is crazy there is oddly a certain believability to it in the films.It's got a big cast from returning actors Simon Pegg, Ving Rhames, Rebecca Ferguson and Alec Baldwin while introducing new comers Henry Cavil and Angela Basett. They are all given enough to do (even Simon Pegg gets some action) but Henry Cavil steals the show as the shady CIA assassin. Rebecca Ferguson is a match for Tom Cruises Ethan Hunt as mysterious MI6 agent Ilsa who can really do some damage. The characters are so well written and we never know what they are going to do next. A few gripes about it is the writers put the action set pieces before the story. The plot isn't as focused as the previous films it's a little thin in comparison. It does get a bit convoluted and there are a few tiny plot-holes. There are some references to earlier movies and a certain character comes back who just felt shoehorned in. It is a little bit too long, they could have easily trimmed 15 minutes from it. However nitpicking aside the film works on so many levels, its well paced, it's dramatic, there's chemistry between all of the characters, it's tense, it's funny and emotional and it has the best music score of them all. It's the most enjoyable action packed entry in the series and will turn you into a hardcore fan like myself. I've seen the previous films numerous times and feel like I need to re-watch them all again now!",

            "content": "I was very fortunate to see this movie at a discounted ticket price for only about 8 bucks, which in this case was an extremely good deal, since it would have been very much worth the normal price of 16 bucks (yes, tickets are usually expensive in Denmark).Tom Cruise has once again found a new way to fascinate and amaze us with the same, good old, intriguing spy story, we all love.Now, because of the standard format of this movie, which has been the template for all the MI movies over the years, I nearly rated it 8 only. But after watching and reading some of the \"Behind the scenes\" features, which is actually just as exhilarating and entertaining as the movie itself, I realized that the the three latest MI movies simply are on a whole new, advanced level:Not only do we get to see a lot of cool action scenes, ie. car chases, well-choreographed fist fights and the usual bomb defusing scene, which you should expect from a MI movie, but because of the fact that we know about Mr. Cruise\u00b4s aversion towards a green screen, this movie reaches entirely new heights.Just now, it is dawning on me, how much more effort and real life heroism went into making the later MI movies over the older ones.To bring this short review down to earth again, I can only submit it with the following statement: Tom Cruise\u00b4s movie career, like his looks, ages like fine wine. It simply gets better each time, which absolutely amazes me. What a unique actor indeed. However, of course I should not forget to mention the great job all the co-stars also do, because one man shouldn\u00b4t steal the focus for an entire movie, but since Tom + director, crew, countless instructors and stunt choreographers have put so much off-screen effort into it, I am going to make an exception in order to really highlight the hundreds and hundreds of hours of practise and preparation, which we don\u00b4t see. Because it seems to me that, in the case of Tom Cruise and his MI movies, the billable hours might just be much more numerous than most other movies.",

            "content": "Mission: Impossible - Fallout is the sixth movie in the franchise, and you'd expect the series to be worn out by now, but somehow the series stays fresh. Mission: Impossible - Fallout feels unique compared to the other action movies in 2018. Every movie in 2018 feels like it tries to be like Marvel; goofy and filled with comedy; I think it's because they're afraid of failing at the box office. Mission: Impossible - Fallout doesn't do that though, they take a serious tone, with few jokes; and honestly, it feels good not to watch a goofy action movie. I always wonder how they can one-up themselves every time they make a Mission: Impossible, and now, I think they reached the top.In this Mission: Impossible, the entire world is at risk by a group called the apostles, who gain access to nuclear weapons. This type of antagonism is different because they don't threat the world for money, they threat the world because of cult-like beliefs. This wouldn't be a Mission: Impossible movie without the plot twist, and there's many plot twists in this one, but all of them are slightly predictable.Mission: Impossible - Fallout is two and a half hours long, and the pacing is fine at the beginning, but at the end, it feels really long. At the end, the nuclear timer is supposed to blowup in 15 minutes, the sequences during that time are double that. You're just sitting there saying to yourself, \"The bomb should've blown up ten minutes ago\", and it feels so unrealistic and it ruins the intensity for me.I like how they always kept the same characters in every movie, and they add more and more to the characters each film, and they always leave a cliffhanger on the characters' relationships. Most movies have cliffhangers on the story itself, but Mission: Impossible - Fallout does it with the characters, which makes the cliffhanger better.The action feels realistic, even though it's insanely unrealistic; which is a very hard thing to do. Mission Impossible - Fallout has some intense action scenes that are filmed in a cinematic way. There's so many locations in this movie that's it's hard to remember all of them, and it's amazing to look at the scenery. Some scenes in the movie show how beautiful the landscapes are, which is rare to see in an action packed movie nowadays.Mission: Impossible - Fallout is another great Mission: Impossible movie. It's action-packed and cinematic. It has a serious tone that grounds the movie to a more realistic vibe; and it reminds me of 80's action movies. I lost my interest in action movies lately, do to the repetitive style of comedy; after seeing Mission: Impossible - Fallout, it gives me hope for the future of action movies.",

            "content": "To be fair, Fallout isn't a bad film. It simply isn't as good as it's being made out to be. Plainly put, it's very boring, dull as dishwater, highly predictable and unoriginal. It's a rehash of several of the previous films in the franchise and especially Ghost protocol in terms of plot. It's nothing a fan of the series hasn't seen before. Angela Bassett plays a CIA director who is eerily similar to her predecessor in Rogue Nation,. The action sequences give off a strong whiff of deja vu. I've seen similar if not identical ones in the James Bond franchise (Moonraker, Casino Royale, the Timothy Dalton and even Pierce Brosnan films among others), The Bourne trilogy and Godzilla (2014) even. When you get sick of action sequences and pinpoint the exact film you've seen it it, that's a problem. This movie, MI: Fallout, is a pastiche of other movies. It borrows heavily from other films and just pastes the parts together. I spent the bulk of the movie saying, \"seen that in this movie and seen that in another.\" I was bored throughout the film. The plot was very run-of-the-mill, one that we've seen in countless films i.e they team up to save the world from radical terrorists and miraculously succeed even though everything's so obvious and treads well-worn ground. There are no interesting twists, you can see them from a mile away. Henry Cavill plays his character from The Man from U.N.C.L.E. except slightly and obviously different and even more boring. There wasn't any nuance to his performance. He reminds me of Sean Bean from Goldeneye except really snooze-worthy. Vanessa Kirby is wasted in this film! The reason I love Rogue Nation is that it's incredibly fast-paced, fun and features a brilliant Rebecca Ferguson. She's great in this film but has practically nothing to do and even her character motivations are a rehash from the previous film. Benji and Luther who are always a delight are wasted in this film and I severely missed Jeremy Renner. There were problems with character development.The plot aims at political relevance and emotional heft but that is it's downfall. We've seen this story before and the themes are so poorly and minimally handled. Every villain is so ridiculously cookie-cutter and cliche. It all reminded me of the Robert Langdon films based on the works of Dan Brown. I didn't see the point of bringing back Michelle Monaghan except for emotional manipulation which didn't even materialize. It was obvious she was brought back to close her chapter with Ethan so he can focus on Ilsa in the next installment. The sentimentality felt forced and cheesy. In addition the film lags for a huge part of it's runtime,. It's too long and on overall I was extremely underwhelmed.",

He takes a nugget that most people would rush through and really fleshes it out and makes something pretty good. Keep in mind people this is MI:6. To have a movie that is this good - this long into a franchise -says something about Tom Cruises's desire to produce something good and, I see that, and I appreciate that.But there were two big problems that really brought the movie down for me. Too many double crosses. Now, I know, this is mission impossible.. that is what they do! But too many added to the mix just confuses the audience and makes it so when you finally get to a real scene, you have no idea if Hunt's wife is going to pull off her face at the end. It cheapens the real story to have too many fake outs. This was way over the top and extended the movie run time needlessly.Second this movie seemed to be going for a theme that what makes Hunt special is that he won't just allow his friends to die for the mission. On the one hand.. I like that. Hunt has come a long way from who he was (as has Cruise) when he was younger and it is good growth. But the problem here was too heavy handed. We could see Hunt's decisions.. we didn't need to hear the CIA higher ups going on about it. Or see Hunt spare a beat cop. Also, kind of makes me wonder if that is the wisest choice for a spy and makes me wonder if it means Hunt needs to retire.Othwerise I thought it was all great. I enjoy the extended action scenes where you can tell a lot was put into it. I enjoyed seeing Hunt's wife again in a way that made sense. I enjoyed Hunt just being an action guy with good friends rather than getting bogged down in a heavy romance. Even Henry Cavill was pretty good. I would watch it with a remote handy.",

I especially liked the MI6 agent who turned anarchist; (or perhaps it was even Ethan Hunt himself, who had turned anarchist?) A pity though, they captured the rogue agent and returned him to MI6 - as anarchists should be free, I think, like dolphins, for example... The movie script was also pretty wild, I think, pretty much in line with the whole anarchist theme of the film. However, it must be emphasised, that Ethan Hunt was very gentlemanly towards that fetching French Policewoman, who took quite a serious hit from one of those badboy anarchists! I actually agree with Ethan Hunt on that point; some people can be so unappreciative and rude to France - so it's a good thing that France was protected and avenged. (In my experience though, French women are quite tough and resourceful; even coming to the aid of male colleagues - when they have been hit - which actually happened to me once, back in the day when I was an activist in Israel/Palestine, and a very fine female French activist came to my aid :) Anyway, I also liked the wicked feminist villain - The White Widow! - and her hypnotic effect on Ethan Hunt; with her mesmerising victorian accent. Reminded me a bit of British royalty and witchcraft - oh no, wait, I think that was the other cool spy, Ilsa Faust, who reminded me of her... So some pretty feisty female agents in this educational spy film! Therefore I certainly can recommend this one :)",

Since Ghost Protocol the Mi films have been the one truly pleasurable franchise, and a large part of this is down to the fact that Cruise and his constant collaborators seem to be having so much fun. The same mask play, absurd stunt sequences and moments of moral rectitude are all present. While the intensity of Hunt's apocalyptic paranoia escalates from film to film. In Sean Harris, Cruise has found an actor as dedicated to committed conspiratorial craziness as he is.Christopher McQuarrie is surely now Cruise's primary creative partner, as they continue a run of great action films, that has helped to resuscitate the career of a filmmaker who had lost his way since the brilliance of THE WAY OF THE GUN. Many of the Parisian sequences seemed reminiscent of that film, especially in its use of the narrow cramped spaces and tunneling boulevards of the French capital. The cast may be up to their same old tricks, with Rhames soulful Luther dispensing old school wisdom like a born-again Morgan Freeman, or Pegg's Benji still feeling like a fish out of water whilst 'in the field', but the Mi films have always been about formula and chemistry. With such a tight-knit team around him it seems unlikely that this will be Cruise's final outing as Hunt, even if there is a sense of resolution and homecoming in the film's frantic final fifteen minutes.",

And this latest one is really no different. Its a solid film which feels really rare when you're the 6th film in a franchise.There was some really great action set pieces. I loved the fight choreography in the bathroom scene especially. I mean, it wasnt always the most realistic action. If you're throwing people through mirrors and ramming them through pillars, I just dont think they're gonna get up from that so easily. But it was still a great scene and executed well by both the fight choreographers and the director. There is great stunt work as well, although I didnt feel like it topped the last installment. Although once you've held on to the side of plane its kind of hard to beat that. I also liked that they brought Michelle Monaghan's character back. I thought it added a nice bit of closure to that chapter in Ethan Hunt's life. I also liked that this film had other ties to the past. Like Vanessa Kirby's character is the daughter of someone in a previous film (I wont say who to try and keep it a surprise). It doesnt play a big part in the movie but I thought it was a fun little easter egg. And overall I didnt find the plot too complicated or hard to understand. In fact there were scenes where I could guess (correctly) what would happen next. There was some comedic moments too. The ones that really tickled my fancy were the little winks and nods that Ethan is getting older and this isnt as easy anymore. Like during the chase scene where he hesitates to jump out of a window. There is one thing that I am kind of tired of with these movies. All of them except the second one have played around with the concept of \"Ethan's gone rogue\" in some shape or another. It doesn't feel fresh anymore. Also, they make a point in this film about how Ethan cares more about his team than \"doing the job\". And I kind of wish there was a moment where Ethan actually had to make a hard decision for the sake of the world/mission. Yes, it would have been dark if he had to sacrifice one of his team members or if he had to kill some cops but I think it would have brought a little more gravitas and weight to the movie. But overall, its a great action movie and if you like the Mission Impossible franchise, I dont think you'll be disappointed with this one.",

This film has some minor issues, but they were nothing too major. Overall, this movie was great and I would definitely watch it again. I rate Mission: Impossible Fallout a 10/10.",

At some point fairly soon now, I would expect that Tom Cruise (age 57) will realize that he can't do all the action-star stunts that would be appropriate for a 30-year-old, including spending a lot of time sprinting here, there and everywhere on screen. Yes, he's got a good stride all right, but those scenes are so contrived that you get the feeling the production crews of his films must deliberately scout out locations that would look particularly photogenic for him to run through.The thing is that Cruise is actually a very decent actor. He's got an easy, comfortable screen presence, and he's capable of turning in quite strong performances given a story and script that are not just setups for action scenes. I'm thinking of examples like Edge of Tomorrow, Oblivion, Magnolia, Jerry Maguire, Rain Man. He's never hard to watch. Some of us would really like to see him to get past the stunt movies and finally get back to doing things that (insert any other decent action star here) couldn't do just as well. For the rest of the cast, Henry Cavill (who has a great voice and good delivery as well as that Superman body) turns in an interesting role -- he's one of the main reasons I went to see this in the theater. Michelle Monaghan and Rebecca Ferguson are both fine though they looked strikingly alike; they could have played sisters. Simon Pegg and Ving Rhames again do fine as the MI sidekicks but again they don't have as much to do as one would have liked. Everyone is subordinate to Cruise, and the script drives that home repeatedly.So then we're left with the stunts themselves. If you mainly want a high-production thrill ride then this movie will do admirably. There's some kind of plot behind it but the explanatory details quickly get obscured in the imperatives of delivering high-octane, adeptly paced thrills. In short it's necessary for Ethan and his MI team to Save The World, what else do you need to know? Some beautiful scenery too deserves credit, both urban and mountainous. But the last 20-30 minutes went beyond impressive to being ludicrous. Sensory overload. And, there is actually no real suspense here because we know the heroes will triumph, maybe a little banged up, but that's all. I still rate the first MI film as the best of the series. It was a good successor to the TV show, where the key feature was the intelligence and cleverness of its plotting, not somewhat mindless action. Generally I'd prefer action movies where the stunts take second place to the plot, not vice versa.What if the latest MI movie opened on the same weekend as a new Bond film? They have become stylistically very similar and appeal to the same audiences. I imagine the answer would depend on which country you live in. But it would never happen.",

The first follow-up in the franchise to maintain the same director, this features an expectedly and enjoyably complex story with the needed misdirection, along with excellent casting that helps maintain a high level of suspense through some of the more plot-heavy moments. Doesn't feature as much high-tech gadgetry as some of its predecessors, but that matters little as it's made more than worthwhile by innovative, first-class stunt work, spectacular, edge of your seat action scenes, exceptional editing, and effective revelations at just the right moments that build to a breathtaking climax.

In regards to the Mission Impossible movies I like almost all of them except 2 but this has to be the best in the series. The plot maybe an issue for some people as its a bit hard to follow if you don't pay attention but I like the fact that the movie is not just a collection of mindless action sequences but it requires you to invest in the plot. The issue with the mission impossible movies has often been the villain but here we got the second best antagonist in the series after Phillip Seymour Hoffman's character in MI 3.

From my perspective the best action movie and overall one of the best cinema experiences in this century.

The action is always fabulous but never seems ridiculous or too much over the top. Also, if you enjoy movies like Inception, True Lies, Interstellar, Tron, Ronin, etc. you will love this movie. The diversity of action scenes and of visual impressions throughout the movie is really immense and absolutely enjoyable. The cast really acts very well together and the script delivers funny moments throughout without diluting the movie and making it too much of a comedy. It is also really great to see Tom Cruise running full speed and full of adrenalin through the entire movie in a way we have seen him doing in so many other movies before (I first noticed that he enjoys running through his movies when watching the Firm in cinema). If you bear in mind that Mr. Cruise is a superstar of cinema for more than thirty years and you see him delivering such a superb performance in this movie, you must admit that still being on top of things after so many years is really an extraordinary achievement hardly matched by anybody.

            "content": "So far, this summer's action and adventure films have been very boring. However, Mission: Impossible - Fallout is far from boring. It's full of adrenaline-pumping action! I believe that this is the best summer action / adventure film of the year and the best Mission Impossible film to date.In this film, we see Ethan Hunt (Tom Cruise) as he receives a mission he chooses to accept, but fails to complete, because of an ambush. As a result, Ethan and his IMF team must work together with the CIA and other familiar allies to stop Solomon Lane (Sean Harris), John Lark (Henry ) and his group, known as the Apostles, from trying to execute a nuclear threat to the world.What I really enjoyed about this film are the sound designs, stunts, plot, cast and all the mind-blowing illusions IMF uses to trick the bad guys. I must say, the sound design is fantastic. The audio for explosions and gunshots sound authentic. It sounds so real that I felt as if I was in the scene. The stunts are intense because, if you don't already know, Tom Cruise does all of his stunts. When he performs them, it is hard to watch since he jumps off of many things such as planes and buildings. I felt so nervous that these stunt are real. The stunts are so nerve racking because most of the movie isn't made with CGI's, so most of the stunts are done exactly how the movie shows it. The story is very interesting. I like that you really don't need to see the other films to understand what goes on in this one.The cast overall is superb. Simon Pegg and Ving Rhames are excellent as the IMF, since every delivery is spot on. I like that Benji is the most nervous character and you feel what he feels when a dangerous event happens. Also I enjoyed the performance of Sean Harris, who really brings in the mystery of this character, since he doesn't speak a lot until the end of the film. Rebecca Ferguson, as Ilsa Faust, makes a great curious assassin, since she always goes the opposite way of the IMF and always finds something different and important, which helps the IMF. Also, Angela Bassett and Alec Baldwin's performances as Erica and Alan are fantastic. I like how their relationship is shown as contradictors, because they both argue their own points. It is a shame we don't get to see more of this in the film. Henry Cavill, as August Walker, is also fantastic. I like how Ethan and August have different ideas about what they should do in the missions and they both try to incorporate their ideas, but those ideas come at a cost.I really like how each scene feels more intense than the last scene. At one point, I thought that the movie was going to end a certain way and I was so nervous about what was going to happen that I almost fell out of my seat. Finally, what I extremely like about this movie is the tricks the IMF use to trick the bad guys. In certain scenes I was surprised that it was an illusion. My favorite illusion is the masked one where Benji wears a mask that allows him to look like anyone.This movie had a lot of great things going for it. The only thing I did not like about it is that it shows way too much in its trailer. However, it is fantastic. I give it 5 out of 5 stars and recommend it to people who like action / adventure and thriller movies. I recommend it gor ages 13 to 18, as well as adults.Reviewed by Ryan R., KIDS FIRST!

            "content": "The familiar chimes of a flute, the booming sounds of a drum, and the orchestra starts up on a familiar tune that is pleasing to the ears of fans aloud. Yes, this can be any movie, but for this reviewer, it means that it's the theme to a series that continues to sneak around in modern times. I'm talking about the spy thriller series that has dug up more terrorist plots than Sherlock Holmes, where gadgets and gizmos are utilized to conceal more than kill. I think you know what I mean, (most likely because you read the title) and thus we enter the latest review on Robbie's list. Your mission, if you choose to accept it, is to read on to find out my thoughts. Agent Karim bringing you a review on: Movie: Mission Impossible: Fallout (2018)Director:\n Christopher McQuarrie\nWriters:\n Christopher McQuarrie, Bruce Geller \nStars:\n Tom Cruise, Henry Cavill, Ving Rhames\nLIKES: Acting: Get down to the basics first, the agents selected for this mission certainly had the skills to bring the adventure to life. A solid chemistry between the various players in the game, Fallout's pieces have been fine tuned to provide a cavalcade of thrilling characters worthy of bringing the conspiracy to life. Cruise leads the group the most, utilizing the majority of the screen time to be the keystone for just about everything. Newcomer Cavill is also a welcome addition, dropping his superhero leotard and its morals for a new set of justice to be served. And as for the supporting players of Rhames, Simon Pegg, Rebecca Ferguson, and Sean Harris they too are elite enough to be integrated into the mix. The Story: If you have followed the series up until this point, seldom do we have solid connections between movies, with only the team and a tiny thread to tie each lead together. For once, Mission Impossible straight up follows a movie, and the continuity is welcomed as it opens up new avenues for than and the gang to travel. While the majority of the plot is pretty straight and narrow in regards to a spy thriller, the victory comes in seeing a few of the characters get unclassified. It's fantastic growth that the series needed that managed to get integrated well. In addition, the story manages to bend from the linear presentation, resulting in a little more excitement to be had. Pace: If it's a like, you know it moves, and for a 150-minute run time that pace is key to keeping people intrigued. Fallout forgoes much of the slower, drawn out jargon filled moments to keep a continuously moving story, which worked very well for me. In addition, the liner story bypassed the convoluted presentation the first movie had, which I think is a victory for most. The Action: Since the reboot of Ghost Protocol, the MI series has really found its roots in the action genre, which works very well for me. Much of the pace of the films has to do with the amount of action in this piece and the numerous sequences it contains of spy warfare. Exciting vehicle changes, some gunplay, and ruthless physical combat await the audience members in this piece and this dynamic change of action theme further strengthened the film. Of course, the special effects and sound editing helped bring the scenes to life, alongside a supporting music list, which gave it the theater worthy quality. Yes, the action is certainly the selling point of the movie and will win the hearts of adrenaline junkies like me to no fault. The Comedy: Again, the writers have done their homework and accomplished a balance of funny meeting thriller. MI 6 does not rely on cheap gimmicks to deliver its laughs, but instead is a display of the art of comedic timing, non-grandiose acting, and simple facial mechanics to deliver the gold. To integrate it into the scenes without diverging too far is an added bonus that I relish to see in future installments. DISLIKES: Cheesy at Times: My friend was right on one level; the MI series continues to get cheesier with every rendition. This isn't a total bad thing, but Fallout sort of crosses into that territory more than the other installments for me (at least form what I remember). It follows a lot of stereotypical spy gimmicks, including the ability to somehow stretch 15 minutes into 45 minutes by some form of magic. In addition, the corniness starts to come in the extreme stunts and nearly invincible forms of the agents until that one special wound. Don't mind this? Fantastic! However, the MI series needs to keep check or risk falling into the obscure stunts laid out by Fast and Furious. Predictable: They tried to throw curve balls our way, utilizing the art of multiple deceptions and suggestions to lead us astray of the true plot. A noble effort indeed, but the film is still a very predictable tale to say the least. Some of this comes from the fact that the movie's linearity is just leading us to the final point and you know deep down something good is going to happen. Another component comes from the fact the five trailers have shown a good majority of clips that you can search for in the 150 minutes. Yet for me, the movie almost tried too hard to throw too many twists into the mix, resulting in lackluster revelations (some of which were buried in jargon conversation). The series had moments to really surprise, they just didn't quite execute them. The Length: Sure, an action filled dynamic was able to lighten much of the load, but that doesn't mean the movie still isn't long. MI 6 is not for the ADD, and may require several trips to the bathroom if you guzzle down your drinks. This is a dislike only because there were some areas that it could have tightened up, as well as several places to end the movie for another sequel. Had they utilized the time better, I think I could have given it higher, but hey, you do get your money's worth right?New Characters: A few were used well, and others not so much. Fallout introduces new pieces to the game that hold potential, but we haven't quite seen their full capabilities unleashed yet on screen. Future installments will hopefully hold the keys to their influences and lethality, but at this stage of the game they were nearly pointless for me for the length they were focused on. \nThe VERDICT: This installment of the MI series is a nuclear blast of action packed stunts, mixed well with an expanded story, good acting, and strong writing by the team. It certainly is one of the more exciting spy thrillers and will fuel the drive to stick it to the end. As the fallout begins to occur though, the lengthy time may wear on you, especially given the predictable, and semi grandiose, elements of the movie that ironically needed some restructuring. Still, all the excitement and special effects nets this movie a must see in theaters for the experience award, and is currently the leader for the month of July for me. Catch it fast before the next rush of movies my friends, or await the rent on Netflix. My scores are: Action/Adventure/Thriller: 8.5\nMovie Overall: 7.5",

            "content": "First things first. Mission Impossible- Fallout is an incredible movie. Tom Cruise raises the bar so high in the sixth entry in Mission Impossible series, and I am already salivating at what comes next. Frankly, saving the world is what Cruise does as a day job. But Fallout is exceptional- world ending context, dizzying action, thrilling chase sequences, picturesque locales, solid acting, witty script and the odd emotional moment - all come together to deliver probably the best action movie so far this year, Infinity War included.\"There cannot be peace without first, a great suffering. The greater the suffering, the greater the peace. The end you've always feared is coming. It's coming, and the blood will be on your hands.\" - Solomon LaneFor the first time in the franchise, we have a sequel. Fallout begins where Rogue Nation ended- Solomon Lane is incarcerated, and the remains of his organization, the Syndicate has become a terrorist group called the Apostles. Due to an uncharacteristic goof-up by Hunt and his IMF team, the Apostles get three plutonium cores, which they plan to detonate in Vatican, Jerusalem and Mecca. Ironically, not very religious, the Apostles. Hunt and his team has to recover the plutonium cores under the watchful eyes of CIA Director Erica Sloane (Angela Bassett) and her stooge August Walker (Henry Cavill). This is a Mission Impossible movie, so mind you nothing meets the eye, and the pace is incredible. The action begins in Paris, moves to London and ends in Kashmir. In it, Ethan Hunt does halo jumps, suicidally bikes against traffic in city streets, runs like only Tom Cruise can, beats up thugs half his age in a Paris bathroom, and hangs out of helicopters for half the movie. Hell, the bathroom fight itself is worth the price of admission. Is this the future of action movies? Maximum action, maximum impact? One begs the question though- at 56 how does Tom Cruise still do it? The Mission Impossible series may be 22 years old, but it still does stunts the old fashioned way, no green screen. Yet each stunt is so impeccably planned and executed, and Cruise goes all out to please audiences. During the production of Fallout, Cruise could have died half a dozen times over, but he emerged only with a broken ankle. Respect. Mission Impossible 6 is also the 7th collaboration between Director Christopher McQuarrie and Cruise, each of them know each other so well that even though the plot is generic, but the inventiveness of the action, the wholehearted trust that Cruise has, and the sudden double crosses ensconced in the script is more than enough for this one to hit gold standards. Of course the references to older MI movies such as the rock climbing sequence from MI2, the moral choices that Nolan explored in The Dark Knight, and the True Lies bathroom fight dials in the nostalgia. The rest of the cast is great. The old gang returns- Ving James as Luther and Simon Pegg as Benji, and Ilsa Faust (Rebecca Ferguson) from the previous movie join in too, along with Ethan's ex-fiance' Julia (Michelle Monaghan) who last featured 12 years back. There is a scene where both Julia and Ilsa share the screen, and then you realize Ethan has a type- tall, leggy brunettes. Cavill is the hammer to Cruise's scalpel, and the movie does not hold him back in the fights. But then with Cruise in such top form, not even Superman is a match for him.10/10",

            "content": "The genre the Mission: Impossible films occupy has always been contested between the likes of James Bond, Jason Bourne and Kingsman, however, 'Mission: Impossible - Fallout' concludes an excellent trilogy of spy films that began worth Brad Bird's 'Ghost Protocol', furthermore, it proves the strongest instalment in the series thus far. Regardless of your thoughts on Tom Cruise, his unquenchable charisma and devotion to these films is impossible to ignore, with the multiplicity of action sequences being as pulse-pounding as they are technically impressive, heavily influenced by frequent collaborator Christopher McQuarrie. This combination results in a film brimming with excellent action, whether it be beautifully choreographed first-fights, one-take halo jumps or inconceivable in-camera helicopter chases. The imagination required to create these sequences is only surpassed by the technical audacity and skill required to actually pull them off. Besides from these action sequences, Rob Hardy's lens helps make it a visually stunning film, building on the visceral nature of these aforementioned segments, resulting in the most beautiful spy film since 'Skyfall'. The plot proves an intriguing progression for the series, continuing the narrative threads set up in 'Rogue Nation', culminating in the development of several character arcs that ultimately prove more emotionally fulfilling than anything we've previously seen in the franchise. Furthermore, the progression of the story is complex, but avoids becoming convoluted, allowing for equal parts immersion and enjoyment, as opposed to potential confusion which all too oft becomes the downfall of similar films. Besides this, the performances featured here further enforce that strength of the film as a whole, with newcomer Henry Cavill proving an intimidating, brutally intriguing counter to Cruise's protagonist. These two are bolstered by a stellar supporting cast, another feather in the already polished cap of 'Fallout', despite the number of background characters coming dangerously close to causing befuddlement in the audience. Christopher McQuarrie and Tom Cruise have, in this film, made one of the strongest American action films in recent memory, forging a visually stunning and technically fantastic film. It is emblematic of their talents that the sixth film in the 'Mission: Impossible' franchise is not only a competent addition, but the best thus far.",

Given the scuttlebutt that Cruise performed his own stunts (and delayed filming at least once due to a pitfall fracture), MISSIION: IMPOSSIBLE--FALLOUT begs the question as to exactly how many replicas exist of this iconic cult figure? Unlike the plethora of blokes who've been trotted out as Jimmy Bond, MISSION: IMPOSSIBLE has tried to maintain the myth that only one actor has filled the role of \"E. Hunt\" over the decades. However, viewers must ask themselves if they REALLY want to swallow such an obvious Hollywood PR fabrication hook, lie, and sphincter. Given TC's cult-like cash cow status, and remembering the fact that we're now living (for better or worse) in the day of 3D biological laser printers, isn't it likely that this movie franchise alone has chewed up and spit out AT LEAST a dozen incarnations of the \"ageless\" Tom?",

First things first, Jeremy Renner is missed. How I wish his absence was explained. The action scenes were very cool but not as immersive as MI scenes normally are. The villain was absolutely pathetic. The script was weak and you were expected to fill in the blanks more than a couple times. How did the villain, who just broke out of jail(and he was in full isolation before) somehow manage to create this masterplan to blow plutonium bombs? It was just not satisfactory. On a positive note, the background music was very powerful, there was some good comedy(courtesy of Simon Pegg as Benji) and Tom Cruise was excellent. But in the end it was just not enough. It seemed like a haphazard movie where they randomly got his wife, Julia, out of the blue. Whether it was August Walker or Solomon Lane who was the villain in this movie seems to be one of mankind's great mysteries(another weak attempt to make it all mysterious like a Nolan film). It took the series in a new direction but it seemed to have forgotten it's roots. The mission was accomplished but not with the same enthusiasm that is normally seen.

It wasn't long into the movie before I wondered if there were any on the movie staff. The abundance of bad science, Roadrunner physics, medical miracles and technical mistakes really started bothering me early and just got worse. I almost want to see the movie again to count up how many unexplained gizmos there were to increase tension or simply to keep the plot moving. The writing is lazy and depends more heavily on crutches than a ward of amputees. Crack shots that miss at the critical time, elite police forces that can't take the most basic precautions, a pilot who can barely fly makes perfectly timed critical mistakes to move the plot while expertly flying through canyons, equipment that fails at just exactly the right moment - it never stops. And trying to figure out why some characters suddenly do inconsistent things will give you a headache. At some point every hero should have been dead at least once, but were inexplicably spared. I'm pretty sure if they'd fixed all the stuff discussed above the movie would have been an hour shorter.On the plus side, if you can ignore the details the story is fiendishly complicated and twisty. Yeah, you can see some of it coming but I'll bet not most of it. While some of it is a bit silly and over the top, there's lots and lots of action. The camaraderie between the characters is nice to watch - they really click.

He is joined, yet again, in this installment of the franchise by his \"usual\" team, Simon Pegg (Benji), Ving Rhames (Luther), Rebecca Ferguson (Ilse) and Alec Baldwin (IMF Director Hunley). It was fun to have \"the band\" back together again. They looked like they had a good time filming this and I had a good time watching it.Jumping right in on the fun is Angela Bassett (BLACK PANTHER) as the head of the CIA, but doing more than just being a thorn in the side of Alec Baldwin. As well as Vanessa Kirby (THE CROWN) as the mysterious \"White Widow\" and, especially, Henry Cavill, who shows that he can do more than be DC's Superman.And, finally, the franchise wisely brings back Sean Harris as \"big bad\" Solomon Lane (think Bond's arch-nemesis Blofeld). He proves to be, yet again, an able adversary for the IMF team.The plot, of course, is somewhat convoluted, with twists, turns and double-crosses (by both the good and bad guys) throughout this film. If I have a quibble for this film, it is that they got a little \"cute\" with the plot twists - there was (perhaps) one or two too many \"gotchas\" - but that is just a quibble, for the plot gets us from point \"A\" to point \"B\" nicely.And when I say \"Point A\" and \"Point B\", I mean action set piece \"A\" to action set piece \"B\" (and \"C\" and \"D\" and \"E\" and \"F\"...) - and boy are these action set pieces EXTRAORDINARY!Director Christopher McQuarrie (he also Directed the previous film in this franchise, ROUGE NATION) is the first person to helm two of these films - and I think it is a smart choice for he established in Rogue Nation an ability to create smart, tense action, chase and fight sequences that are easy to follow and fun to watch.Credit for most of this fun has to go to 55 year old (at the time of filming) Tom Cruise - looking every bit as fit and capable as a 35 year old Tom Cruise. He dives into the action sequences (literally) with gusto and proves more than capable of delivering the goods. Once again, he does a death-defying stunt that left me amazed.But, what I really left the theater with was an appreciation for McQuarrie, Cruise and company for delivering an end sequence that earned the build up it was given. EVERY member of the company had something to do and the action in this endpiece was a step up of anything that had come before it - either in the Mission Impossible series, or in any other action flick.If you are a fan of good, solid action films, MISSION IMPOSSIBLE: FALLOUT is one to not miss.Letter Grade: A9 (out of 10) stars and you can take that to the Bank(ofMarquis)",

I'm guessing that Tom Cruise isn't the only person who recurs and I assumed that Style would triumph over Substance so I didn't spend too much time attempting to figure out the good guys from the bad or even what was going on again factoring in double and triple crosses as par for the course. This left more or less only the action and punters can hardly claim to be short-changed in either hand-to-hand or chase sequences. Although I went to an early - 9.50 - screening and it opened seven days ago I was surprised that there were only seven punters including myself. It passed the time adequately but I wouldn't want to see it again.",

From the chase scenes to that brutal bathroom fight, right down to the ever-heightening stakes, it just seems to build and build. If it's not a tense dialogue scene, then it's probably Tom Cruise defying age yet again. The icing on this cake is that the movie never gets too big to forget the series' rubber-mask espionage. Christopher McQuarrie deserves credit for trying to humanize the character of Ethan Hunt in this film. For once, he's not just a skin for Tom Cruise to slip into and do stunts, but an actual person. There's an unexpected heart to this movie. But there's only so much room for touchy-feely before it's back to the endorphin rush. And Cruise deserves ample credit for this. Sure, Hunt's nigh-indestructible - more super than spy - but the star throws himself into this role. There he is, doing the majority of his stunts like a madman; out to prove he isn't too old for this sh**. Youthful appearance aside, he clearly bathes in the blood of the innocent. Regardless, this movie proves that Cruise is the consummate entertainer in Hollywood, delivering on his promise of thrills and death-defying lunacy. I think that's why this has become one of the more reliable franchises, and I can only hope he keeps it going. If only to outdo that helicopter fight scene. Sweet Jesus!",

            "content": "Unlike James Bond, the Mission Impossible films seem to have that uncanny habit of consistently getting their recipe just about right. You'll doubtless have your own favourite from this long-running re-booted franchise, but it's hard to deny the quality of each and every chapter that unfolds.And according to many, Mission Impossible: Fallout is in fact the pick of the bunch.Not that it's in any way ground-breaking or indeed some sort of game changer. It's evidently not. But through a few well-placed tweaks to a familiar, tried and trusted story line, Mission Impossible: Fallout succeeds in being both entertaining and suspenseful enough to keep the old grey matter sufficiently engaged over the film's two-and-a-half hour duration.Directed by Christopher McQuarrie, Mission Impossible:Fallout continues Hollywood's current trend of acknowledging the ageing process in our big screen heroes, depicting them as getting a little long-in-the-tooth for the extra-ordinary feats that continue to be asked of them. They are of course, by and large, human after all.This has been very evident in the closing chapters of Daniel Craig's residency as James Bond, as well as Arnold Schwarzenegger's increasingly arthritic attempts to keep up with the machines that threaten both him and those that he attempts to protect within the Terminator franchise. Granted, Schwarzenegger's character is not exactly human, but the point still stands. Old age will eventually make us all obsolete.Accordingly, there are one or two \"Christ, not again... really?\" withered looks of despair that flash across the face of our resident Mission Impossible hero, Ethan Hunt, during certain more physically demanding scenes. A small yet tell-tale sign of an action hero who is fast becoming aware that old man time is finally beginning to catch up with him.Never is this more evident than when Ethan Hunt is paired up with a Government-appointed somewhat younger sidekick, August Walker (Henry Cavill), who, resplendent with 1980's moustache could ably be passed off as being Freddie Mercury's man-mountain Cyborg love child, were he to have had one.I'd imagine.The threat of terrorism-induced nuclear armageddon provides sufficient motivation for Cruise and his merry band of foe-foilers to dig deep, pull out all of the stops and once again achieve the truly extraordinary under nigh on impossible circumstances.Some things never change.Simon Pegg, whilst adopting his usual role of light-relief-bringer in otherwise super-intense circumstances, is however noticeably less jester-like during this particular outing. Ving Rhames once again portrays the dependably tech-savvy Luther. Rebecca Ferguson is all seductive glamour, beauty and know-how as agent Isla Faust, whilst Sean Harris is probably more weaselly than sinister portraying ideologue and all-round enemy of the state, Solomon Lane.But in a larger-than-life tale of espionage and counter espionage, it's once again our vertically-challenged shiny-toothed hero that steals the show.As he always does.Say what you will about Tom Cruise the high-ranking Scientologist and fully paid-up member of the Hollywood aristocracy. This is a man seemingly impervious to any and all attempts by media hacks to publicly assassinate his character by repeatedly calling into question his most private of private lives. But one thing remains undeniable:He's simply superb at playing these kinds of roles, in fact I'd go so far as to say that Tom Cruise is very possibly the finest exponent of our time of playing the Action Hero.The cracks may well be just starting to appear, but whilst there's still life in Tom Cruise, there's still life in Ethan Hunt, and that can only be good news for the innumerable fans of this most unfailing of film franchises.This and hundreds of other films are reviewed on my WaywardWolfBlog",

Ving Rhames, at times, just seemed like he was trying to get over with his scenes. Pegg and Monaghan overacted while Cavill tried too hard to underact his role as superspy colossus. Vanessa Kirby made a great addition as the White Widow and pretty much stole every scene she was in. Angela Bassett, likewise, makes a much better hardened bureaucrat than Alec Baldwin.

No matter how good you think Mission: Impossible III was it should not have even gotten that far, but I do feel it was that movie that started the franchise in going the direction of a true franchise.Fallout once again features Cruse as Ethan Hunt, head of the Mission: Impossible field agents. Continuing from the movies previous Ethan and his team have to stop a rogue agency from using stolen plutonium to make three nuclear bombs.Once again on Ethan's side is Luther Stickell, played by Ving Rhames who has been in every Mission: Impossible movie since number one, and let me tell you, I love just seeing that Ving Rhames is still in this franchise. As good as Ghost Protocol was on it's own the best part about it was that they did not forget about Luther who made a cameo at the end. Also joining Ethan again is Benji Dunn played by Simon Pegg who has been doing this since Mission Impossible III .The adventures of Ethan Hunt and his team have become episodic. In a lot of ways I like it cause it makes a lot of the missions more mimic those done in the original series (only bigger obviously). Although it does mean that you have to have seen the other Mission Impossible movies to follow the actual story that's going on.However, if you chose not to follow the story, Fallout is filled with some great and unique action sequences that were outright impressive. Mission: Impossible goes for the more realistic suspense and low tone over the archetype dramatic hype.It's a change of tone that allows the filmmakers to add humor to the movie that blends in pretty well (Better if you have been following the Mission: Impossible franchise).Mission: Impossible Fallout is a great movie, it's good action and if you are into the franchise the humor is nice, especially between Cruse Rhames and Pegg who lead the charge.",

Furthermore, the complex narrative manages to keep it all together, creating an unique, suspenseful atmosphere.

            "content": "The Mission: Impossible franchise has now had continued success for 22 years, I had heard about this sixth instalment months before its release. This is because of the Superman star growing a moustache which had to be digitally removed in Justice League, and because of the lead actor breaking his ankle jumping from onto the edge of a building whilst filming in the UK. I was very much looking forward to another movie in the series, from returning director Christopher McQuarrie (Jack Reacher, Mission: Impossible - Rogue Nation). Basically two years since Solomon Lane (Sean Harris) was captured, the remains of his organisation The Syndicate have reformed into terrorist group The Apostles. In Belfast, IMF (Impossible Missions Force) agent Ethan Hunt (Tom Cruise, also producing) receives details of a mission to intercept the sale of three plutonium cores, members of the group are acquiring them for a fundamentalist called John Lark. Ethan travels to Berlin and meets up with Benji Dunn (Simon Pegg) and Luther Stickell (Ving Rhames), but the mission fails when Luther's life is at risk and Ethan chooses to save him, and the Apostles take the plutonium. Nuclear weapons expert Nils Debruuk (Kristoffer Joner), who has been working with the group to build three portable nuclear weapons, has been captured and is interrogated, he is tricked into believing attacks have occurred on religious sites in Rome, Jerusalem and Mecca, to obtain information on the Apostles' next move. Newly appointed CIA Director Erica Sloan (Angela Bassett) instructs Special Activities Division operative August Walker (Henry Cavill) to watch over Ethan, as he attempts to retrieve the plutonium. Ethan and Walker parachute into Paris, where they infiltrate a fundraiser party at the Grand Palais where John Lark will buy the cores from the Apostles, with the arms dealer called the White Widow acting as broker. Ethan and Walker track Lark to a bathroom, they get into a fight, Lark is killed by former MI6 agent Ilsa Faust (Rebecca Ferguson). To complete mission, Ethan impersonates John Lark and meets with White Widow (Vanessa Kirby), agents of the Apostles have been sent to kill John Lark and the White Widow, but they manage to escape. In order to secure the plutonium, Ethan (as Lark) is tasked with securing an asset, which turns out to be Soloman Lane, who is being transported in in an armoured convoy moving through Paris, Ethan is given one of the plutonium cores as payment to extract Lane. Ethan does not follow the original plan, as he knows it would have failed, he and his team attack the convoy and Lane is extracted, but Ethan's loyalties are tested, as Isla reveals that the MI6 want Lane dead, it is her mission to kill him. Ethan avoids the White Widow's forces, the police and Ilsa during a motorcycle and car chase that takes place across Paris, the mission is successful, whereupon the White Widow instructs the team to deliver Lane, as well as Ilsa, to London. At a safehouse in London, Alan Hunley (Alec Baldwin), Secretary of IMF, confronts Ethan about being John Lark, Ethan eventually convinces him that the mission that should continue. Walker unwittingly reveals himself to be the real John Lark, in association with Lane, after Benji disguises himself as Lane, Erica Sloane also notices and instructs a shadow CIA team to take Lane, Walker, and Ethan's team in. The CIA team have in fact been infiltrated by the Apostles, Walker orders them to attack the IMF, Hunley is stabbed and killed by Walker in the ensuing fight. Ethan tracks Walker across the rooftops, with the help of Benji, Luther and Ilsa, to the top of the Tate Modern, where Walker escapes in a helicopter with Lane, but not before threatening the life of Ethan's estranged wife, Julia (Michelle Monaghan). Travelling to Kashmir, where the terrorists are heading, Benji reveals the two remaining nuclear weapons are synchronized with each other; if one is defused, the other will detonate, but both can be deactivated, as long as the countdown is started. To complete the defuse process, the key must also be pulled from the detonator before the countdown reaches zero, otherwise the weapon will detonate. Lane's plan for the weapons is to contaminate the water supply of Pakistan, India, and China, meaning a third of the world's population will be affected. At a medical camp, where the abundance of radiology equipment can disguise the radioactivity of the bombs, Walker has manipulated for Julia and her new husband, Patrick (Wes Bentley), to be onsite to raise the stakes for Ethan. Solomon Lane activates the weapons, giving the detonator to Walker, taking off in a helicopter, Ethan pursues in a second helicopter, leaving Benji, Luther, and Ilsa on the ground to find the weapons. Luther finds the first weapon and get help from Julia to defuse it, while Benji and Ilsa find the second weapon and fight with Lane, Benji is nearly hanged to death by Lane, but Ilsa subdues him and rescues Benji at the last minute. Ethan and Walker engage in an aerial helicopter chase, before Ethan rams Walker's aircraft out of the sky, crashing onto the edge of cliff, the two engage in a fight, until Walker is falls to his death. With just seconds to go before the blast, Ethan is able to get control of the detonator while Luther, Ilsa, and Benji deactivate the bombs, in the aftermath the remaining plutonium cores are safely recovered. Lane is handed over to the MI6 by Erica Sloane, through the White Widow, Ilsa is exonerated, Ethan recovers from his injuries with the help of Julia, the rest of the team join him following their victory. Also starring Frederick Schmidt as Zola, Liang Yang as Lark Decoy, journalist Wolf Blitzer as himself and Alix B\u00e9n\u00e9zech as French Police Agent. Cruise as the lead hero and doing most of his own stunts still proves the great action man, Harris is good as the returning villain, Cavill is great as the suspicious shadow agent, and Pegg and Rhames add both comic relief and great support. As with most of the films before, it takes us all over the world for espionage, chases and fights, all bigger and better, there are a good number of fast-paced scenes and memorable stunts, including the noticeable one that went wrong, and the story also has some realistic terrorism themes, a satisfactory action spy thriller. Very good!",

But you knew that.I find it very hard to separate Tom Cruise the tabloid personality vs Tom Cruise characters. He's either mentally-sick for his devotion to Scientology or he's over-a-barrel doing movie after movie to pay hush money. Good for him in his rant about people wearing masks, though, in that on-set Internet rant.Cruise does fulfill the physical requirements very well as the action scenes were nicely crafted. The gem is the restroom fight. The others are fun but err'd on the side of conventional. Very high production values made up some gap. But the bike chase in Paris got to be silly in its speed. Return of the Jedi started this in the speeder chase with being so fast that no one would keep-up with their reflexes.But Cruise can pull off \"moments\" like when meeting Monagan at the camp. Or the \"What don't I know?\" \"I'm working on it\" or \"Jumping out a window\" lines. The \"outraged\" scene with Baldwin was too much for him, though.Not bad emotionally, from the dream sequences to a decent attempt of him caring for his team and others. Good comedy at points. I saw the reveal near the end of the 2nd act with Caville's turn by referencing the rule, \"It's the last person you expect.\"I'd like to see Cruise in a bad guy role, to know if he could do it. I'm on the fence. His attempt at faking a bad guy in this was, \"Meh.\"Story-wise it suffered for being too complicated in some instances and obviously writing themselves out of corners in the other. Very clear what would happen in the early hospital scene.Even as Cruise as the bad guy walking in the night before the breakout. The breakout was ready to go without the bad guy (him). Hunt participating was not crucial for its success so wasn't for the deal for the plutonium. But don't pay attention to that, dear audience (the director pleaded). Clearly just a reason to have another action scene. Nothing else. (Not portrayed but was likely Hunt's realization that Cavill's character was the actual bad guy. Although it was so bad that Cavill should have also known.)Not a bad way to spend 135 minutes, though.",

The idea of John Wick was way better but Wick 2 was disappointing.Its becoming ridiculous when you see its always about Tom Cruise in the movie. Its nothing to do with Mission Impossible. He gets beaten by one single Asian guy and the next minute he is beating up 5-6 trained killers like nobody's business. Its just awful and sickening. Then the shot where his bike starts at the last minute so the bad guys could catch up to take some shots which of course magically they miss with all that guns at peril.

Cavill or Cruise?I'm surprised that this got above 5 star ratings. Cruise in cruise control with his impossible fans.

Andmy expectations where highly satisfied. \nThe story of this one is a sequel for Rogue Nation, so the characters that I loved of the previous one are back. The way this film is writen and narrated is so good, dynamic and intelligent. The action stunts and sequences are incredibly good choreographed and are satisfactory real, no trace of CGI, greeen screens or any visual effects. \nThe action, however, even though it's great, sometimes is a little exhausting, and the scene is over leaving you wanting for some air, but that feeling of intensity is something that makes you live the movie like you where there. The plot is full of twist and turns, but not any plot-hole. The way the situation changes from one scene to another is so chaotic that you need to give full attention to the movie all the time. I really liked the interaction between Henry Cavill and Tom Cruise, but I wanted to see more moments with those two. \nOverall, this movie was so satisfactory that it's instantly one of my favorites from the last few years.",

            "review_title": "One of the Best Spy/Action Movies Out There!",
            "content": "As a fan of action movies as well as someone who enjoys spy film, I dig the Mission: Impossible series starring Tom Cruise. So, naturally, I was very much pumped to the return of the franchise in Mission: Impossible - Fallout, as well as the return of Christopher McQuarrie in the director's chair (who previously did the 5th film the series, Rogue Nation) and the return of Cruise as Ethan Hunt. The critical acclaim that this film got upon release also increased my anticipation for it, as I feel that a great action movie is one that is not only technically well-made but also one that can grip you and have you on the edge of your seat during the set pieces. I am more than happy to say that Mission: Impossible - Fallout did not disappoint me in the slightest. I can go on, with full conviction, in saying that it's the best M:I film by far (the favorite one was previously Rogue Nation, but now it's Fallout), it's one of the best action films of the past 10 years, and it's the best spy film I've seen since Skyfall of the 007 franchise. Now, all that being said, I'm gonna dive right in and further elaborate on why I feel the way I do about this movie.First of all, the action scenes are very well-made and very impressive to say the least. Christopher McQuarrie very much has an eye in shooting his action sequences in a way that immerse you. Whether it's a sequence involving Ethan Hunt (Cruise) and CIA agent August Walker (Henry Cavill) skydiving out of a plane or an intense car/motorbike chase in Paris or a helicopter dogfight, the action scenes in this movie are shot and directed so masterfully and they also evoke so much tension to make the viewer hold their breath whenever things are about to go down. It also very much helps in adding to the suspense when it's Tom Cruise himself doing all the stunt work in the movie; it adds an extra layer of realism and suspense seeing this man actually doing these death-defying stunts, thus making you care about what's gonna happen to Ethan Hunt even more.The cast all-around does a great job in this movie. Tom Cruise definitely brings his A-game as Ethan Hunt; he's intense when events that transpire in the movie call for it, and he can pull off providing some levity when he needs to. Cruise has also always been great at providing stunt work throughout the M:I films, but, in Fallout, it's like he took that experience he got as his own stuntman and honed it in over the years and then it all paid off in a big way. Simon Pegg and Ving Rhames both do a great job as Benji and Luther respectively, who bring in some great comic relief that doesn't compromise the movie's overall tone. Rebecca Ferguson returns to her role from RN as Ilsa Faust, and seeing her come back as the badass spy who has her own goals in mind (goals which carry over from RN and which one can understand) is quite a treat. Henry Cavill (along with his mustache) plays August Walker, a CIA agent brought in by Angela Bassett's character to watch over Hunt after he and his IMF crew failed on an important mission which sets the plot in motion; Cavill does a great job playing off of Cruise with the banter amongst each other and Cavill also does awesome work in the action in the movie, including in a brutal fight scene set in the restroom. Sean Harris returns as the villain Solomon Lane and he gives a menacing performance as he did in his character's debut back in RN, except here there's the extra layer of menace added to this character as he seeks revenge against Hunt and the IMF for taking down his Syndicate in the last movie; you totally get why Hunt would want this guy locked behind walls of concrete with the key thrown away, making Lane the only villain in the M:I movies who can rival and even surpass the menace of Philip Seymour Hoffman villain character in M:I III.The plot/storyline, while it's certainly not much that we haven't seen before in other spy movies and even certain twists can be seen coming, was still very riveting. Our heroes, particularly Ethan Hunt, made the mistake of saving one of their own from the bad guys, the newly-anointed Apostles, in priority over securing the plutonium, which was their real mission; that error would then bite Hunt and company as they have to find a way to correct it before the Apostles could use the plutonium for diabolical means, and one would be rooting for Hunt and company because of their comradery which makes them very much likable and worth caring about. It's the characters being worth caring about that also gives that much more weight to the action and suspense that has the viewer white-knuckling throughout the film. Even the certain twists that take place in the movie have purpose and they all line up and make sense within the plot itself and given what's established throughout this series.When it comes to the score, Lorne Balfe has done an incredible job providing the music for the film. People would consider the score for the film to be very similar to Hans Zimmer, but one has to keep in mind that Balfe was a protege of Zimmer's. And, I can honestly say that the student has become the master as Balfe did not just do a fantastic score in M:I - Fallout, but he even made a score that was better than Zimmer's within the same franchise (with Zimmer having done the score of M:I 2).When it's all said and done, Mission: Impossible - Fallout was an amazing action/spy film and was an overall great time at the cinema. The cast was great, the directing was beyond top notch, the action scenes were wonderfully-crafted, and the movie itself has set a new standard in what to expect in action films. I'll very much look forward to what we get down the road from this series, although this film is certainly gonna be a hard one to top. M:I - Fallout gets an absolutely strong recommendation from me; it's among my absolute favorite movies of 2018 and it is also one of my favorite spy films of all time.",

In the past, we would cruise through team members such as Maggie Q, Jonathan Rhys Meyers, Paula Patton, and heck even Jeremy Renner who was not in this flick... but we have grown into others like Ving Rhames (whose character wasn't just there to look cool and throw in some one-liners, but rather to shed some actual emotional weight), Simon Pegg (who has finally earned his wings\"in the field\" where I feel he and newcomers Alec Baldwin (underused again) and Rebecca Ferguson Yes, they threw in some new characters in this film... I'd say one too many for me to keep track of... but they didn't interfere too much with the chemistry already in place with the other actors/actresses surrounding Tom Cruise , particularly three of them. \n. I think it is enough of a companion to make 3-6 part of a larger something when all watched together, even though 4 is only loosely connected at this point from a story perspective. In terms of feel however, it is not like any of the other M:I films before it. Instead of going for sleek and stylish, they chose raw and gritty in more ways than one. It really had its dark and serious moments, even played demonstrating it would carry more epic i but ultimately you would feel it. It still had light humor time-to-time, but this was not a light-toned film in the slightest. I don't know if \"grounded\" is the right way to describe the film's attitude but any time that it is on the ground everything is pretty simple. This film isn't built around stealth and technology; in fact, outside of masks and GPS-tracking (and some thing reading off a mission), I honestly couldn't name a single piece of technology that was more advanced than it definitely had a throwback feel to it, pulling the reins a lot but not in a forced way. This one just didn't call for a lot of futuristic technology. Because of the characters involved, YES. Outside of one of the beginning set-pieces, every action scene in this movie is heavily built up and driven by the story around it, and felt like the story's impact of the moment was always bigger than the stunts being pulled off. This is a good thing, but that also means it's not all surface-level entertainment. You could pop in your Blu-ray of any of the previous three M:I films and watch an action sequence and just go: \"Hell yeah.\" In this film, each moment is earned",

            "content": "Disclaimer: This is my first review. If you have any tips on making a review, please help. I don't know if I'm doing this right but I hope I'll make more reviews for the audiences to be aware if the film is any good or not. This is only my review. My own opinion of the film so, don't go crazy if you and I have different perspectives on a film. Mission: Impossible - Fallout is the 6th film in the Mission: Impossible franchise and stars Tom Cruise, Ving Rhames and other characters mostly from Rogue Nation. Henry Cavill as well. It's about Ethan Hunt and the rest of the IMF agents looking for missing Plutoniums after a mission gone wrong while being monitored by CIA assassin August Walker.To me and other critics, this is the best installment in the franchise. The performances are top-notch, the direction is precise, and the stunts are phenomenal, making it the highlight of the film. The story involves weapons of mass destruction which is something we've all seen before, but it is the most character-driven story the franchise has to offer. Hunt and other characters are constantly being tested and challenged physically and emotionally, making them compelling to audiences. They're not robots, they're not super powerful agents, no. They're human beings. For Tom Cruise, great performance as always. Ethan is a character torn apart and fearful of the possible outcomes, making his character believable. As for the stunts, the best since 2015's Mad Max: Fury Road. Tom Cruise's dedication to the film made it seamless with all the practical effects and the lack of CGI. Even the rooftop scene was real. It really happened. One thing that the franchise has struggled with is making a good villain. Of course, they're the ones who make the protagonists drive the plot but they're not developed enough as a character. The only villain ever achieved this is Phillip Seymour Hoffman's character Owen Davian. This film, Solomon Lane, played by Sean Harris achieved this as well. He was intimidating, sinister, well-developed. His performance made it all the more interesting. The action sequences are also great. The use of wide shots made it clear and made the stunts even more clear. The humor in the dialogue is also on point. It never felt really flat. Overall, I enjoyed watching Mission: Impossible - Fallout. It's the best installment in the franchise and possibly one of the greatest action films of all time. All the cast were great and the stunts and the cinematography were at it's best. 10/10-Yman Dayawon",

            "content": "(Originally published on the Impacting Culture blog)\"There has never been peace without first a great suffering. The greater the suffering, the greater the peace.\" - Opening to \"The Apostles' Manifesto\", composed by John Lark (?????)Potential spoilers belowWriter-director Christopher McQuarrie has uninstalled the revolving door of directors for the Mission: Impossible (M:I) franchise......and delivered, in terms of pure action, perhaps the best Mission: Impossible installment to date.McQuarrie's screenplay for M:I - Fallout (hereafter referred to as just Fallout), on the other hand, is a step down from his last one, and no action, however masterfully crafted, can distract from that.Two years have passed since Ethan Hunt (Tom Cruise) of the United States' Impossible Missions Force (IMF) captured former British agent turned anarchic terrorist Solomon Lane (Sean Harris). The remnants of Lane's group The Syndicate have reformed into The Apostles. Hunt and fellow IMF agents Benji Dunn (Simon Pegg) and Luther Stickell (Ving Rhames) fail to prevent The Apostles from obtaining three precious plutonium cores that their new client, the mysterious John Lark (?????), could turn into three portable nuclear weapons. IMF Secretary Alan Hunley (Alec Baldwin) tasks Hunt to impersonate Lark, who has arranged to obtain the cores from The Apostles in Paris, with black market arms dealer Alanna Mitsopolis/White Widow (Vanessa Kirby) acting as broker. To ensure that Hunt does not fail, CIA Director Erica Sloane (Angela Bassett) dispatches Special Activities operative August Walker (Henry Cavill) to stick close to Hunt. Once Hunt meets the White Widow, she agrees to hand over all three cores in exchange for one favor: Hunt must break Solomon Lane free so that she can return him to The Apostles.Now if only British MI6 agent and past ally Ilsa Faust (Rebecca Ferguson) did not have orders to kill Lane at the same time.One cannot discuss Fallout without first bringing up its fantastic and heart-pumping action sequences. The near-perilous HALO jump into Paris, the high-speed chase through Parisian streets the next day, and the insane helicopter chase towards Fallout's end all benefit the most from Eddie Hamilton's restrained cutting of Rob Hardy's cinematography and the intense sound mixing by Gilbert Lake and Mike Prestwood Smith. (Rob Hardy also shot Annihilation from earlier this year.) The bathroom brawl showcases Cruise, Cavill, and stuntman Liang Yang's commitment to Wade Eastwood's peerless stunt coordination and Wolfgang Stegemann's fight coordination. As the sixth entry in a franchise that has so far eluded Academy recognition, Fallout stares intently at each of the Academy's below-the-line-related branches and states plainly but firmly, \"Nominate me. Now.\"I mentioned in my Incredibles 2 review from earlier this year that I had begun to regard that animated film \"less as a stellar follow-up and more like a stellar appendix\" to its 2004 predecessor. In light of 2015's Rogue Nation, I have a similar regard for Fallout. Nearly all of Rogue Nation consists of Hunt, his IMF colleagues, and newcomer Ilsa Faust reacting to a situation beyond their control and working tirelessly to prove their innocence against Solomon Lane's treachery, with the audience right behind them throughout. Thanks to Christopher McQuarrie's screenplay and direction, Rogue Nation harnessed its genuine and well-paced suspense and ferocious wit to earn its satisfying finale.Fallout, as a more direct sequel to Rogue Nation, starts with Hunt receiving his next mission as usual and failing it due to \"good intentions\". He and his team must then resume the mission, improvising where needed, and all while cleaning up the mess with CIA's star Agent Walker watching over their shoulders. In between Fallout's spectacular action sequences, the twists blow minds and the handful of conflicting interests among the characters give off the appearance of a complex action spy thriller. Yet upon reflection, these plot elements, which come to a head during Fallout's London bunker sequence, make writer-director McQuarrie's second M:I contribution more muddled than necessary, bordering on implausibility. Furthermore, even the most casual viewer will never doubt the heroism of Tom Cruise as Ethan Hunt. This is Mission: Impossible, not Collateral, and ingredients like a plan to massacre French cops cannot simply get brushed aside.My first viewing of Fallout left me as excited as anyone else by its enthralling and relentless action. In that respect, Fallout is the best Mission: Impossible movie and Christopher McQuarrie embraces his deepest directorial instincts to reach creative heights yet unattained. Likewise, Tom Cruise continues to cement his action star legacy, even as he approaches 60.Upon leaving my re-watch, however, I could no longer shrug off Fallout's confusing web of espionage double-crossings. Complexity has its place, but so does clarity. Rogue Nation had clarity and the wit to help its intricacies reach the minds of audiences, as did the first Mission: Impossible from 1996 and the fourth film Ghost Protocol from 2011. I wish that some of the clarity that so gorgeously marks Fallout's exceptional action sequences had rubbed off on its plot.Still working on it? A bit too late for that.(Parental Note: Mission: Impossible - Fallout has been rated PG-13 by the MPAA \"for violence and intense sequences of action, and for brief strong language\". It has also been rated 12A by the BBFC for \"moderate violence, injury detail,\" and \"infrequent strong language\", and rated A-III (Adults) by the Catholic News Service for containing \"much violence with some gore and gruesome images, acceptability of divorce, a couple of uses of profanity, two milder oaths as well as a single rough and several crude terms.\")P.S. After all was said and done, keeping the mustache was worth it.R.N.B.",

Which is kinda crazy cause I have always been a huge fan of the spy drama since I was a little kid.So much that it is very strange when I find a spy franchise like this that has been around for so long, but hey....its fun not going to lie there. The biggest positive I can see on this movie was the action is freaking amazing. Every scene feels truly brutal and powerful. I love movies with this very brutal action scenes that feel very much like John Wick or Winter Solder. Every punch given feels harder and it makes the stakes feel higher than they are. And Tom Cruise only adds to that with his action also not being perfect. He isn't the perfect fighter in the film. There are scenes where he falls and gets hurt and you feel that. Moments of just real intensity that just blow you away.Henry Cavil also plays a great yang to Tom Cruise as his really ramps up every scene he is in and heck even steals the show at certain points and I absolutely love that.He pulls off every scene he is in with great flare and a mustache to boot to go along with it. Was the mustache needed? I don;t really think so, but it was a great add on anyway. The movie's greatest weakness is its execution of its twist. The twist really feel forced and unneeded at times for me. More to give a big gasp over anything else. Im not going to give away the twist here, but there is a scene or rather a collection of scenes back to back when we get one twist after the other and it feels really dragging. Overall though Mission Impossible is a fun time at the theater and one I'd highly recommend.",

I saw it in imax, which was great especially for the sound and for the couple imax scenes the film had. The helicopter chase scene was really good and it alone is worth going to imax for if you know what to look for in image quality. But if this movie was good for anything, it was to show how much different the image from 35mm is to imax, and gosh I wish it was all shot in imax. The cinematography was really lacking in this film and at some points the really grainy images were too distracting to be enjoyed. The camera crew who are probably used to shooting digital tried to apply same techniques on this film by shooting with super fast lenses and guess what, there are more out of focus shots that you can count which was also annoying, to the point that it took away from the story. This film's biggest mistake was to choose to shoot it in 35mm film, sorry guys not the imax experience I was expecting, all imax did was to really emphasize the filming mistakes. The plot with all the predictable face changes is what is to be expected from a MI movie. However the action scenes are very well crafted and do put you at the edge of your seat, especially knowing Tom Cruse did all the stunts for real. Overall it's a very good movie that you should enjoy, don't see it in imax as it really only has one imax scene and it's not worth the extra money, especially because it will annoy you with all the image mistakes, so you are better off watching it in a regular 2k projection.",

The main reason is the super complicated and quite flawed plot of the film. Just because the writers understand it does not mean the whole audience will. It is thus bizarre that a number have raved about this film when there is a good chance not all of it made sense to you either. It starts off normally enough with a mission gone wrong when the plutonium is not captured. Then the plot becomes messy. The motive of why the predictable bad guy Henry Cavill is not revealed. We do not know why he one day woke up and decided the 'old order' needs to be replaced by the 'new order'. The lack of motive as well as no valid reason Solomon Lane or Walker kill Ethan Hunt is given besides Solomon wants to take revenge? Even though he likely had many chances before to do take it but doesn't it. For this and other reasons the plot collapses on itself. The plot is complicated, messy and badly written. Inception was a complicated film but it was well written and made sense. Besides the impressive action scenes, stunts and views this is one of the weakest additions in the franchise. It is not as good as ghost protocol and rogue nation.",

The first one being a classic in my opinion, the second one being alright, the third one being a great comeback, Ghosts Protocol being a very fun flick and however I found Rogue Nation to be a little underwelming, it was still a very enjoyable film. I think I could say that Ghost Protocol was my favorite...but then Fallout came out and wow did it blew me away.Everything that has been done in this movie is I believe the best what they could have done with it. The acting is great, the soundtrack is very thrillig by Lorne Balfe, the cinematography is absolutely mindblowing and with that comes a great amount of top level action setpieces. Tom Cruise absolutely delivers in pretty much every way (the fact that every setpiece is practical with hardly any CGI makes it so much better).Now for flaws I guess you could say that the story is a little bit ordinary, and by that I mean that it's nothing we haven't seen before. There's once again a nuclear subplot, Tom Cruise runs an insane amount as expected (not that thats a bad thing) and I also thought that the build up was a little bit rushed. Let's say that from the beginning until the opening credits is a little bit too fast for my liking, but that's only opinion of course. From the moment Tom delivers his first stunt, the movie is pretty much a non-stop rollercoaster that will keep you on the edge of your seat. To top everything off, there are also some nice twists and unexpected turns of events along the way, so I suggest to keep your attention on the dialogue constantly because otherwise you might lose track.A must-see movie guys! It gets an 8.7/10 from me. \nMission accomplished!",

Unfortunately there are things that hold it back from that and everyone can have different opinion of what are the negatives.\nThe problems that i have are: the story as a whole is very weak; the characters (aside from Ethan, Benji and Luther) are weak and not interesting; the script is mixed with one half being very standard dialogue; the editing could have been better and music is bland and forgettable. But it does have also positives like the sound; acting; huge percent of the cinematography with some ok shots; the other half of the dialogue is very good; there is some moments of good editing here and there and three moments in the story that were great, but i wouldn't mention, because it will be a spoiler for some.\nAs a whole the film is decent at best and it could have been better with some positives and action sequences that makes it enjoyable. If you are a lover of action films, then i recommend Mission: Impossible - Fallout, but if you are looking for a great story, well written characters and good dialogue, than this film is probably not for you, but you can still give it a shot.",

Who would've thought they'd save their best stuff for the sixth film? Here is my review of 'Mission: Impossible - Fallout.'In the sixth film in the series we are reunited with Tom Cruise and his infamous 'Ethan Hunt' character as well as the rest of the gang, Simon Pegg and Ving Rhames. This film is directed and written by Christopher McQuarrie. This is the second 'Mission Impossible' he has directed, the first being 'Mission: Impossible - Rogue Nation' (2015). Following all the hype mustered up by this film I found myself surprisingly excited to see it. I got to see the opening day viewing and I was not disappointed. Christopher McQuarrie is the perfect director for these films as proven by two back-to-back successful films as well as this being, in my opinion, the best film in the franchise to date. 'Fallout' is a sheer epic. It has everything you want in an action film and it does it all perfectly. While giving the audience some intense and top-notch barrages of action, writer/director Christopher McQuarrie balanced in a very strong and clear pointed plot. This perfect balance made for a perfect action film. Tom Cruise yet again delivers a strong performance and his stunts continue to be jaw-dropping. McQuarrie's direction with these action sequences are perfect and some stunning and edge-of-the-seat scenes do happen rather frequently in this film. Henry Cavill is also in this movie and it was great to finally see the now infamous-stache on the big screen. I had my slight doubts in him at times during the movie but continuously with each and every passing scene Cavill seemed to just get better and better. He brought a lot to the film and definitely served a strong purpose. Simon Pegg is entertaining as always, as is Ving Rhames. Sean Harris is also in the film and he brings a good strong presence as the films mysterious villainous character. Harris owns the role and brings genuine darkness to the film. What puts this film head and shoulders above other action flicks is the insane and pristine camera work. Some of the shots that were taken during this film are absolutely stunning and I found myself turning to the person beside me admiring these shots on several occasions. This all made for rather grand and certainly epic scenes. The moment I left the theatre I was ready to turn back around and head back in for more. While the story isn't necessarily fresh, Christopher McQuarrie does a good job at telling this story and unfolding a very picture-perfect spy film. There are some characters I definitely would have liked to have seen developed more. As previously stated, the brilliance in balance within the film is truly unmatched and story is not compromised at the hands of over usage of CGI or cheap jokes. This is the quintessential action movie of 2018 and the summer blockbuster we needed oh so badly.",

Without breaking a sweat, wearing his trousers. When it comes to road races, he knows how to handle pretty much every land vehicle in a most diverse situations; Schumacher and Rossi are lucky he never competed against them. Besides, we all know Tom could fly military fighting jets from an early age earning his place at top school. Who could've thought he'd be equally good at flying choppers! (There are several brief and subtle Top Gun references in this MI which are going to be appreciated by TG fans.)All of that and I haven't even come to his fighting, climbing and shooting skills! Tom can shot pretty every weapon included in all of Call of Duty series on a marksman level, harshly eliminating all threats. I won't spend much words on his climbing skills but will just say this: he can climb a flat wall while having a fever and several bones broken. Toe to toe fights finish before they even start - bloody details are unnecessary. When it comes to morals, Tom never thinks in utilitaristic terms; he probably doesn't even know what that means! Thank you Tom for showing me how fallen creature I am by making the most noble and cherished decisions never recorded before in even the most sacred of scriptures. On the other hand, his superb intelligence allows him to always be on the right place at the right time! I can't even in my wildest dreams imagine Tom being late or exacerbating already precarious situation. That being said, it is evident Tom is not an ordinary agent. He's on a completely another level! He is \"super-agent\" with most of the emphasis on \"super\". Super-duper agent. Next Mission Impossible should be titled: MI - Top Tom.Let me conclude with a real life example. Once my friend told me how he was concerned about the world ending. I told him: Do you realize Tom Cruise is still alive and is probably going to live longer than both of us even though we are half his age? That terrible idea hasn't crossed his mind again to this very day!********Putting jokes aside, if you're in for some non-stop action with rather complex narrative, there's no way you won't be entertained.

From the screeching tires and roars of motorbikes and helicopters whipping through the wind and tom cruise running in typical cinematic fashion and stunning scenary in the backdrop from London, Paris, Beligum, Kashmir and so on. Its a beautiful film and is even enchanced with the terrific soundtrack. The action is most likely the best i have ever seen in a movie. Tom Cruise loves a risk with all his extreme stunts and it really does take your breath away. Henry Cavil (Walker) Nicknamed The Hammer, definitely fits the name! Not to smart but packs a hell of a punch.. So much happens its just a stunning and intese experience, you definitely should not blink as you may miss something.

At No.6 in the franchise, the whole edifice has scarcely felt fresher, coming hot on the heels of it's equally solid and entertaining predecessors Ghost Protocol and Rogue Nation. Daniel Craig and Barbara Broccoli must be quaking in their boots at the prospect of losing the spy genre crown. I don't know how much longer Tom Cruise can go on making these high-end action films, but he's in fantastic shape for a man in his mid-50's, and looks at least 10 years younger than he is in real life.\nJeremy Renner's absence was not a problem, but there was no explanation for it in the script so far as I could tell. In terms of team balance, however, all the essential elements were in place. The plot leans heavily on Rogue Nation, so the casual viewer may feel a little lost if they skipped on the fifth instalment before seeing this one, but the whole thing has enough of an identity of its own to be thoroughly enjoyable either way. I imagine a new plot line will be necessary should there be a 7th MI film.\nThe new face on the block was Henry Cavill's CIA assassin Walker, who brought a different dimension to proceedings with his 'blunt instrument' approach; quite a different beast from his suave and polished Napoleon Solo in The Man From Uncle.\nSo long as the Christopher McQuarrie/ Tom Cruise team can keep it fresh and interesting, I urge them to come back with more in a few years' time.",

In that sense, What I say here probably won't change any minds since people are just looking for a fun time. And hey, if that's you, then go and enjoy yourself with the biggest screening you can find because this movie gets pretty insane.So what is the problem I'm alluding to? It boils down to two words: Tom Cruise. Christ, does this movie idolize him (he pretty much is Jesus Christ). Behind the crazy action, you start to see what this movie truly is - a $200 million vanity film. I mean, I guess it's not uncommon since a lot of times these movies are made to make these Hollywood actors feel like they're the most awesome and badass human beings alive, but this is just childish. Everyone in this movie cannot shut up about how brilliant Ethan Hunt is; how changed a life, how he is protecting the world, how he cured cancer and saved the rain forest while bringing world peace on his way back from ending hunger in Africa. Oh, but in spite of his irresistible charm and inhuman physical endurance, he is such a tragic and sympathetic character. He has so much weight on his shoulders that we must all marvel and how all he copes with all the hardships he must deal with. What a hero, we must all love him because he is just so wonderful.If you hadn't noticed, the character worship completely took me out of the movie. I think the moment it truly hit me was when people wouldn't stop yapping about how \"Ethan can never make the cold choices and is too merciful\". This culminates when Ethan and his entourage are fleeing the French police and almost make it before running into a simple patrol officer. Everyone thinks she should be shot before an alarm is raised, but not Tom Cruise - because he is such a gentle and wonderful soul. And of course since this is just a random patrol officer in the middle of France, she has to be ridiculously attractive with the look like a supermodel, so Ethan does everything he can to let her go. But then the evil bad guys show up and shoot her instead. Oh no! What is Ethan going to do before the bad guys finish her off? Of course he's going to go into \"white knight\" mode and shoot 5 armed men before anyone can move, and then going to help the supermodel officer before she dies of her injuries. What a wonderful man. Have we mentioned how awesome Tom Cruise is?In short, everything in this film is done to make Tom Cruise look like the perfect man. If you ever watch \"Going Clear\" the Scientology documentary, there is a part on Tom Cruise where they say everyone is ordered to treat him like a God. The entire church of Scientology is essentially there to pump up his ego and make him feel like he's the savior of mankind - and wow, do you see that same mentality in this movie. It must be nice to have everyone in your little bubble tell you how great you are, but it is nauseating to sit through a two hour film of it.This isn't just me being jealous or envious or something like that. I mean, who wouldn't love being a Hollywood actor and make so much money, right? But this is all just stuff I really find pathetic about some people. It's like a 8 year old's idea of a perfect life. I wouldn't be surprised if Ethan sleeps in a race car bed with posters of himself all over the walls. Or maybe that's just Tom Cruise.",

            "content": "Mission Impossible - FallOut adds more shine to the franchise, which was started 22 years ago, makes the stunt more realistic and adrenaline-pumping. Tom Cruise does all the stunt by himself and good god, he is just 56 years old.In the sixth edition, Hunt and his team have to race against time to track down a dangerous terrorist named Solomon Lane, who is planning to strike on the world with global nuclear destruction.Written and directed by Christopher McQuarrie, who also made Jack Reacher and Mission: Impossible - Rogue Nation (2015), Mission Impossible - FallOut brings out the real action and stunts infused into the film. The movie opens with Ethan Hunt saving his friend, Luther, but losing the track of plutonium bomb which takes his team right from Paris to London and finally concluding in Kashmir. The makers have ensured that all scenes performed by Cruise himself is as real as possible. The plane scene where Tom Cruise performs a halo jump from a military aircraft which requires specialized equipment and substantial training, is jaw-dropping. In the bike-chase action scene in Paris, Cruise gets hit by a car and rolls-over couple of time before he makes himself stable, is probably one of best action sequence I have seen in my life in any movie. Similarly, in the roof-top scene in London, Cruise is required to run and jump from the roof of one building onto the next one, proves that he is probably the best in the business (he actually breaks his ankle during the shooting). Even the climax scene with helicopter chasing, beautifully shot in New Zealand, will keep you on the edge of the seat. Kudos to the mind blowing choreography and adrenaline rush stunts for making the action sequences look so natural while Tom Cruise should be lauded for his death-defying stunt.The action-adventure does have its share of flaw as well. The length of the film is too long with running time of 2 hours 27 minutes and should easily be trimmed. The plot, with lot of twist and turns, of the film is a standard one but screenplay falters during the second half. The cat and mouse game should have handled efficiently. In spite of few shortcomings, the film manages to keep you on engaged with witty humor and performances. Cinematography is eye- catching. Art direction is mesmerizing.Tom Cruise is just awesome, to be precise. The actor not only performs his own stunts, he is so enduring in his role that you would hardly think of any other actor doing the part of Ethan Hunt. Henry Cavill does well in the supporting role. The rest of star cast do justice to their part.Mission Impossible - FallOut is one of the best film in the 22 year-old franchise. Go for it if you want to get pumped-up, enjoy yourself and of course if you are a Tom Cruise fan. Excellent : 4/5",

The film starts with Cruise's Ethan Hunt and his team (Simon Pegg and Ving Rhames) losing several cases of plutonium to a group known as 'The Apostles', an organization formed from the remains of The Syndicate, and are teamed up with the CIA's Agent Walker (Henry Cavill) in an attempt to retrieve it. In a franchise of great action and stunts, the third act of Mission: Impossible - Fallout pushes it over the edge with a shootout in airborne helicopters, which was arguably the best stunt of all time and raises the stakes in multiple areas. The cast of the film were also phenomenal, with many reprising their roles from previous entries in the franchise, several of which (Alec Baldwin and Rebecca Ferguson) were able to steal the scenes they were in. Overall, Mission: Impossible- Fallout is the best MI film yet and is a film worthy to see in a full theatre.",

            "content": "The Mission Impossible series is a really solid action franchise. With the exception of the second film, the rest offer good fun and nice twists, basically the perfect summer popcorn movie. Early reviews for Fallout were super. I heard people calling it the best action film of all time, and also the best in the series. Thus, this film became my most hyped for the summer. After watching, I'm not sure if its the greatest action film of all time (though the action is admittedly insane) but it is my favorite of the series.Ethan Hunt returns once again with his crew but this time three nuclear plutonium cores have been stolen and Hunt must find out how to retrieve these devices. Along the way, he must partner with a mysterious assassin (played by mustached Henry Cavill) and gets involved in a high risk international plot involving many set pieces. Sounds familiar to the other films and it is in most respects. However, there is a lot that is improved upon and I think its with distinction that this is the most well made film in the series.The cinematography is excellent. The on site locale is a wonder to behold, and the effects and location blends in very well on screen. The action scenes are insanely good. Its almost jaw-dropping that this film can achieve higher levels to its already insane action. The fight scenes are intense and so crisp. Love him or hate him, you have to applaud Tom Cruise's commitment to the film, even if it means taking a bump and getting hurt.The film is oddly low in humor, which is something that is ever present in big budget films these days. This wasn't problematic at all for me. MI 6 is definitely a film where you want to pay close attention to every bit of dialogue and seen, because its easily to get lost in the intricacies of the plot. I wholeheartedly enjoyed this effort though. The score is a perfect accompaniment to the action in the film. I think the bathroom fight scene and the car scene are as good as it gets when it comes to filmed chase and fight scenes.Absolutely everything doesn't work as some characters fade away into the background. The film is also long, so you're in for a trip. Its enjoyable though. I had plenty of fun with this and do recommend it for fans of the franchise and cinematic thrill seekers. Its a very well made action film that goes the extra mile and by far the best in the franchise, for me anyways. How often can you say the sixth in a franchise is the best?8/10",

Tom is still refreshing, energetic and ageless with his mind blowing stunts and coolness. Fallout is the 6th instalment of this action packed series Mission Impossible which was originally based on a TV series. The foundation built by the first three series was so strong that, now we can't imagine a MI series without Tom Cruise. Mission impossible means Ethan Hunt and Ethan Hunt means Tom Cruise, that' all! End of discussion! I know all of have had already watched the trailer of Fallout but still I will share it.We all know what Mission Impossible is all about. There is a villain who is trying to destroy the world and he believes in the philosophy that There cannot be peace without, first, a great suffering and the greater the suffering, the greater the peace' and to stop him from doing this, Ethan Hunt is set on a mission. Every instalment of this series has a different villain and different hurdles but Ethan will surpass them easily, and will save the world. The starting of the film was very normal, I thought that's why they were focusing so much on stunts, the story is very normal but they proved me wrong!! As story moves, the grip is tightened with each suspense and event there is a twist in movie and at last I was convinced that the \"very normal\" starting of the movie was necessary to give the audience a much more fulfilling experience in the later part. Talking about the \"impossible\" things of Fallout, first and foremost, Tom Cruise!! What a work he has done!!! Amazing work! I mean if there'd be an Oscar for commercial Cinema then I think Tom would have won it a long time ago. HE IS THE SAME OLD ETHAN!!!!! I mean, there is nothing left which he has not done to entertain us. With the same energy, same attitude and same coolness he has done his work. And the remaining gaps are filled by the stunts. I mean, you will think, \"Does he fear death??\" the answer is NOOO!!!! There is nothing left for him, he has done all the stunts by himself! In Ghost Protocol he climed Burj Khalifa and I was like OKAY! This is the limit but again in Rogue Nation he was hanging out on a plane!!! And in this movie he has crossed the limits he is hanging on a rope attached to a helicopter! I was like, \"man, you hate this life? huh??\" Second, best thing is Cinematography, and especially of the action sequences, that helicopter sequence looked sooooo big, soooo big on screen that I got gossebumps while watching that scene. Two helicopters flying over mountains, and Tom Cruise hanging on a rope. That's the beauty of that scene. In the starting you will think, when will the action come? When?? But when it comes, you will be like, please don't end this please!! But the film makers knew that apart from Tom, action is what audience will be looking for and yessss!! This film will not leave you unsatisfied. You will love Tom while he runs on bike in the streets of Paris, you will love him when he did the HALO jump, you will love his sense of humour, you will love him in every aspect!!The last and the most important thing which I observed was the audience reaction. In theatre, whenever there is a play going on stage, there is a big importance of audience reaction. Their reaction gives you an idea that how well the play is going on, is audience liking it? Such natural reactions were there in this movie. I mean on every big event or stunt audience was reacting. The scene when Tom jumped and broke off his ankle, even after knowing this fact, the audience reacted as if this was the first time they have seen it. What other thing a film maker wants apart from this, that audience so much related to their cast that if they are injured the audience is feeling bad. That's a beautiful thing in this movie, every incident, suspense, fight scene, on everything the audience reacted and according to me that's a great thing, it shown how much gripping your movie is. If someone asks me \"how's the movie?\" I would just say \"just like Ethan Hunt\".",

I liked Rogue Nation the best, and for good reasons, but I just didn't get that same feeling of complete satisfaction after seeing this one. I feel like everyone is praising this film for it's really great action and giving it 10's just for that. I give it a lot of points for it's cool effects and action, because it does those things really well. But I feel like it suffered in other areas. I don't think the performances were quite as strong here as they were in the previous films, with the exception of Cruise. Not saying that the acting was bad because it wasn't, but I just didn't feel as invested as I did in the others. I also don't think the pacing was as good. And I felt like the other films had more content wise, I felt like I had been on a wild fun adventure afterwards.

The characters usually have a \"game plan\" story that you follow with them. Something goes array and then you get to see how the characters improvise.

Apart from the opening scenes of Tom Cruise hanging off the Airbus A400 in Rogue Nation, this film is notable for having some of the best shot scenes in the series to date. This episode sees Ethan Hunt struggling to catch up on himself to right a mission that has gone wrong. All the old favourites are back with him, Ving Rhames, Simon Pegg, Alec Baldwin and a second appearance for Rebecca Ferguson, apparently not something achieved by a female cast member before in Hunt's team. Fast paced, fast motorbike chases, fast helicopter chases, fast plot.

            "content": "Your mission, should you choose to accept it, is to see how far Tom Cruise is willing to push himself. Tom Cruise, regardless of his mysterious personal life, has to be one of the hardest working actors in Hollywood. His ageless face (I swear, he has not aged since the early 2000's) along with his willingness to pull off crazy stunts, has kept him in the spotlight in an age where movies have had to compete with better television and streaming content. Yeah, he'll have an occasional misfire like Knight & Day and whatever The Mummy was supposed to be, but he may be one of the last \"A-name stars\" that have the same draw that stars of the golden years like Kirk Douglass and Jimmy Stewart. The Mission Impossible movies are not only his most successful film series, could be argued as one of the most successful adaptations of a TV show. In fact, when I mentioned this to a movie theater employee, he had no idea that it was based on an 1980s show. Whether it follows it closely is anyone's guess, as I haven't watched it. But if future movies are a lot like Mission Impossible: Fallout, then Tom Cruise should be safe. IMF agent Ethan Hunt (played by Tom Cruise) accepts a mission to intercept a group of terrorists called The Apostles (made up from the remnant's of The Syndicate from the previous movie) from selling plutonium. Along with Benji (played by Simon Pegg) and Luther (played by Ving Rhames), he tries, but fails to protect the plutonium cores from disappearing. He does get an idea from a nuclear weapons expert where they may be sold; Paris. The IMF is scolded by CIA director Erica Sloane (played by Angela Bassett) for their failure, and thus has CIA operative agent August Walker (played by Henry Cavill) shadow them. For their next mission, Hunt and Walker HALO jump into Paris to intercept the dealer, only to also encounter Ilsa Faust (played by Rebecca Ferguson), another agent from the previous movie. They all agree to work to meet with the arms dealer, only to encounter The Apostles as well. On top of that, even the CIA doubts Ethan Hunt enough that they suspect that he could be turning sides. The race is on for Hunt to find the plutonium cores and prove he's still the biggest adrenaline junkie in all of Hollywood. I'm glad to say that Mission Impossible: Fallout is phenomenal! Is it the best of the series? On its own, I still think Mission Impossible: Ghost Protocol was perfect. As part of the bigger story, this does build upon the themes of complications of government agencies in conflict. It just happens that this is the better movie. Not only are the stunts more memorable, but the pacing is better and more align with a spy thriller. It helps that director Christopher McQuarrie has staged much of the action that does reveal that there aren't any wires or CGI replicating. Even if that's not the case, it manages to keep us in constant suspense with not too many edits. The HALO jump especially look cool as it's done in one long take. Tom Cruise remains as charismatic as before. This really isn't much of an acting challenge as he's basically playing himself. He makes up for it in overall charm, his adrenaline rubbing off on all the stunts, and even the occasional humor. His lack of fear could have derided another performer, but something about Cruise's method makes it work. I think it's that he genuinely does seem to have fun hanging off of helicopters and jumping across buildings. I mentioned before the this follows the story of Mission Impossible: Rouge Nation, but that is mainly on the villain Solomon Lane, who played by Sean Harris, has made for this series equivalent to Blofeld in the 007 series. Though it's pretty obvious how things are going to turn out, his overall confidence and intimidation does make you suspend that for the duration. Simon Pegg and Ving Rhames are just as entertaining. Rebacca Ferguson has a lot of awesome moments. Without spoiling anything, let's say that Henry Cavill does pose a challenge for Tom Cruise.Let's give this nine helicopter chases out of ten. This is certainly one of the best in the series (though Mission Impossible: Ghost Protocol still ranks slightly higher). You don't need to have seen the others to enjoy this, though it does help to have seen the previous one. You get enough of an idea of who these people are to enjoy the story regardless. I highly recommend this and you should accept this mission.",

With the release of the first film entertaining action fans and Tom Cruise fans alike, it was inevitable that a sequel would be made. Personally, I think the second film easily could have sunk this franchise easily. Mission: Impossible 3 revitalized the franchise in terms of character and story and the rest is history. In terms of critical reception and fan appeal, this franchise is better than it has ever been. Mission: Impossible - Fallout has just hit the big screen and I would be lying to myself if I didn't give in and say this may be my favourite of the entire franchise. I know that's a bold statement, due to the fact that the previous two films were fantastic, but let's dive in.Picking up a couple of years after the events of Mission: Impossible - Rogue Nation, this is the first film in the franchise to directly continue a storyline from movie to movie. I was slightly wary of this notion, but I believe it worked very well. Following Ethan Hunt and his team after a failed mission, this team seeks out three orbs of plutonium, to prevent further, global catastrophe. While it seems like these are the McMuffins of the story, Solomon Lane (the previous villain) also becomes a McMuffin for the team, as he stirs up more trouble for them along the way. This is a very complex movie at times, which leads me to my only real complaint.Although this isn't technically a negative, because they pay everything off in a very nice way throughout the third act, it does feel like there is a little too much going on at times. The reason I don't find any of these movies absolutely perfect is due to the fact that they choose to be overly complex in their execution of certain storylines. From world-ending possibilities, to double-crosses, to bringing back previous storylines from past movies, and even to relying on an emotional core to the film that some viewers may not latch onto if they haven't seen the other movie, it can be quite the task of a movie to sit through. That being said, I'm a huge fan of this franchise and I was able to follow everything quite easily, so I think the execution of my possible, aforementioned complaints are only an issue if you haven't seen its predecessors.Mission: Impossible - Fallout almost seems like a culmination of everything since the third movie and the action is just the icing on the cake. Although slightly ridiculous at times (which of these films isn't though), the action throughout this film is some of the best that this franchise has ever seen (in my opinion). From the hand-to-hand combat to the aerial chases, to the terrifically daring stunts, this is a sequel that doesn't pull any punches and satisfies in both storytelling and pure, adrenaline-fuelled excitement. At a pretty lengthy 147 minutes, I never once felt bored. That's probably due to the fact that I loved a lot more than just what was on its surface.Christopher McQuarrie returns from the previous film to direct and although each film has a history of switching directors, I believe he did a job worthy of continuing from the previous instalment. He, along with superb cinematography by Rob Hardy and a surprisingly fresh sounding score by Lorne Balfe, everything about my experience of this film was nothing short being utterly impressed. It's not very often that I find myself praising a movie for being near perfect on a technical level, as well as story and action, but Mission: Impossible - Fallout did it for me.In the end, Mission: Impossible - Fallout at least deserves to be in the discussion for best of the franchise, even if you personally don't agree. If you can allow yourself to be completely immersed in a movie for nearly two and half hours, then I believe this may be one of the better moviegoing experience you'll have at the theatre this year. Aside from feeling a little too complex at times, there are many arcs that come full circle and I felt incredibly satisfied. Mission: Impossible - Fallout may not be an Oscar-contender, but I had an absolute blast with it and it's surely going to be included with some of my favourites of 2018.",

Henry Cavill and Tom Cruise have a great dynamic in the film. A lot of the plot seems a bit overstuffed and some characters a bit unneccessary. The humor is unexpected for this kind of film, and it's great. Simon Pegg has some of the funniest lines here. Definitely one of the best entries in the series.\nGrade: B 8/10 4/5 stars",

They are characters that you know, they have the chemistry of an established team, which helps the audience care about their fates. The story isn't anything too complicated, neither as elaborate as the first film or Rogue Nation, basically the IMF are searching for a couple of bombs designed to cause a new world order but its enough to drive the plot along. As the bad guys from Rogue Nation are the antagonists again, this allows no time to be wasted on developing their motivation so it's straight into the action. Which is where the film really impresses, as every action sequence ustilises practical effects with refreshingly minimal CGI, only used to enhance events otherwise unfilmable ie an adrenaline charged motorcycle chase through Paris. For me, the main problem with the film is that no attempt is made to hide who the traitor is, which is once again, unoriginally, a rogue agent. That said, this is a minor flaw and when the finale occurs it is a pulse pounding assault to senses that leaves you on the edge of your seat. Fallout is a well made action film that never bores, always entertains and definitely needs to be seen on the big screen.",

HAHA. In 15 minutes Cruise stole a helicopter, fell from it in midair hanging from it, climbed back up, disarmed two soldiers, took over the helicopter, chased the other dude through mountains getting shot at for what seemed like forever, then crashed the mountains, meanwhile the other crew spent time looking for the bomb, got captured, tied up, got loose, fought the bad guy for what seemed like 20 minutes.

The director Christopher Mcquarie makes a thrilling story which from start to finish is brilliant. They also chose a great actors like Henry Cavill playing a villain is actually quite enjoyable and you also see the return of the films previous characters such as Ethan's ex Julia played by Michelle Monaghan and Solomon Lane played by Sean Harris. Now the actions sequences are really really good they are thrilling from the moment the scene starts and end brilliantly. The best actions sequence in this film is when Ethan is chasing August Walker after it's revealed he's a double agent. The amount of jumps from the buildings are tense cause you think he's gonna slip and he does as one the stunts he breaks his ankle and it was shown in the trailer and before in talk shows. The stunt work in this film is brilliant. Every time they do a stunt they top it off with something else later on which is worth it.

Not the best acting either.... the list goes on.Some stars given for the quality of the stunts and the camera work is very good, it's just that it has all been done before and when will Hollywood learn that we are all bored of their traditional formula. Come on, stop being so lazy. Realism is what we want and no, realism is not boring.

Just the commitment and passion that the filmmakers, crew, and cast have devoted into this entry especially when it comes to the action concepts and sequences-which are rightly accomplished stylishly-are to be praised alone. It's the best Mission Impossible movie yet, and if there's even more to come (remember we're already six films in!) then I'm 100% on board. (Verdict: A)",

            "content": "\"Mission: Impossible - Fallout\" (2018), directed by Christopher McQuarrie. Starring Tom Cruise, Ving Rhames, Henry Cavill, Sean Harris, Rebecca Ferguson, and more. Now that's an all-star cast lineup! One neat thing to point out, that all of the \"Mission: Impossible\" films were all directed by someone different. That's a good idea, because each movie would be unique and fresh because it's respectable director brings their twist to the aforementioned film. This marks the very first time that two \"Mission: Impossible\" films were directed by the exact same person, Christopher McQuarrie. Also, this is the final movie in the current saga of \"Mission: Impossible\" films. \"Mission: Impossible - Fallout\" is my third favorite \"Mission: Impossible\" film of the series. Perfect story, perfect acting, perfect special effects, beautiful sets/locations, and a perfect soundtrack to tie it all together! The story is very well laid out, and it keeps you invested from beginning to end. Just like \"Mission: Impossible III\" (2006), and \"Mission: Impossible - Ghost Protocol\" (2012), all of the action sequences work and are well choreographed. The acting is overall outstanding from all of the actors and actresses. But, the one cast member that I was worried would ruin the movie was Henry Cavill. He is one of the many reasons why the modern day DC superhero films suck (EXCEPT FOR \"THE DARK KNIGHT\" TRILOGY). He is definitely not Superman, by any means. Despite what everyone else insinuates. I don't think they could've picked a more out-of-place actor for Superman. If I was a casting director, and a casting agent came over to me with Henry Cavill and said: \"I think that this man would be a great Superman!\" I'd immediately say, \"YOU'RE FIRED!\" Henry Cavill is absolutely not worthy of the Superman title at all, and neither is the so-called \"costume\" they made for him to wear. Christopher Reeve is, and will always be the one and only, true Man of Steel. However, the Superman role is just a step back in Henry Cavill's acting career, and that doesn't mean Henry Cavill can't act well in other movies. Sometimes actors end up being cast in the wrong movies, but if they're cast perfectly then the movie will be much better. That's definitely the case for \"Mission: Impossible - Fallout\" on his behalf. Henry Cavill put on a great performance in this movie! He was perfectly cast, and did a great job in this role. A movie can make such a big difference in how great the performance of the actor, or actress is. I honestly think Henry Cavill would be great as the next James Bond! They need to boot Daniel Craig (THE WORST BOND ACTOR OF ALL-TIME, BUT HE IS GOOD IN ENTIRELY DIFFERENT MOVIES THOUGH) out of the franchise. Which is what they should have done 12 years ago! Henry Cavill would make a great James Bond! Pretty much any English actor, except Daniel Craig, would make a good Bond! Any way, back to my \"Mission: Impossible - Fallout\" movie review. The special effects are first-rate. Being made in 2018, that's no surprise! All of the sets/locations are beautiful and really set the tone for the movie. Finally, the soundtrack is very well composed, this time by Lorne Balfe. He's not as good as Michael Giacchino, but I think he did this film score justice. \"Mission: Impossible - Fallout\" is a phenomenal achievement. Christopher McQuarrie did a great job directing, no wonder he was called back again. They really struck gold with him! This is a fantastic movie, and I can watch it over and over again and never get tired of it. Of course, I give this movie 5 out of 5 stars on my scale, which equates to 10 out of 10 IMDB stars. At close to 150 minutes, \"Mission: Impossible - Fallout\" is the current longest film in the series. It is one of the fastest two and a half hours I've spent watching a movie. It goes by in the blink of an eye! If you haven't seen it, your mission, should you choose to accept it, is to go see \"Mission: Impossible - Fallout\" as soon as possible. This review will self-destruct in five seconds.",

The scene with Henry Cavil in the bathroom where neither one of them was up to the fight was funny (neither Ethan or Superman can take him!).

Could it be that McQuarrie/Cruise has run its course? Or, is this rather predictable misstep the blame of Producer J.J. Abrams (\"Star Wars: The Last Jedi'), who hasn't really been on roll these days himself? Present is the \"should you choose to accept it...\" destructing instructions, the debonaire Cruise, the familiar MI theme music (by Lorne Balfe), attractive co-star (Henry Cavill \"Superman\"), the cold-hearted boss (Angela Bassett), goofy side kicks (Ving Rhams and Simon Pegg), car & motorcycle chases, daredevil leaps, bounds and flights (by Cruise), fight scenes that rarely cause a bruise, gun battles that always hit the bad dudes (but never the good guys), terrific London cinematography (Rob Hardy), good and bad love interests (Rebecca Ferguson \"The Greatest Showman,\" Vanessa Kirby \"The Crown\" TV Series, and Michelle Monaghan \"Pixels\"), and a few fun/interesting secondary roles by Wes Bentley (hot off of \"Yellowstone\" TV), Alec Baldwin and CNN Newscaster Wolf Blitzer. And, if that's not enough to stimulate your senses, \"the dossier\" (not today's \"dossier,\" but the word dossier) gets tossed into this action packed extravaganza. Personally, I found the whole thing \"been there, done that\" from the get go. Maybe it was McQuarrie and Bruce Geller's verbose writing that required the actors to continually overly explain what's happening, why it's happening and what might happen if something doesn't happen. Even the fun twists and turns that are usually associated with this series, are predictable and lack exciting impact. Hey, this is MI and we're told to love this film.

The story, however, did not hold my interest. Simply put, it's about thwarting a terrorist attack by double crossing double agents. Seen that before? The issue isn't just the tired old save-the-world generic script but the heavy onus on Tom Cruise to hoist and thus save the film from mediocrity; which he does single-handedly. But it isn't enough. The action choreography, though thrilling, has all been done before. Not only in previous films of this franchise, but the same as in the Die Hard and Bond films. If John McClane can take down a helicopter with a car and James Bond can take out a motorcade with a plane, then guess what? So can Ethan Hunt. But if these are standard expectations in superspy films, then there should also be a super villain we all love to hate. How good was Philip Seymour Hoffman in MI3? In this film, the villain, who turns out to be a double agent (SURPRISE!) is an embarrassment to the entire cinematic world of villains. But I like how he ended up resembling Two-face from the DC comics (so much for being a double agent...two face, get it?).So if I recommend this film, it would only be for Tom Cruise and his infectious energy in every scene, with one in particular revealing Ethen Hunt has a heart of gold. As Maveric, Ron Kovic, Cole Trickle, Lt. Kaffee, Lestat, Jerry Maguir, Les Grossman, Tom Cruise has immense versatility matched only by his onscreen magnetism. At 56 he's still got it and probably the only reason \"Mission Impossible - Fallout\" is watchable. That said, the second biggest disappointment (after the wooden villain) is the lack of any real mission that is seemingly impossible to pull off. Part of what made the earlier films thrilling was just that: the hi-tech heist. From dangling upside down to steal a microchip in the first film to actually holding his breath for six minutes underwater in \"Rogue Nation\" (to steal another computer chip), doing the impossible was one of the highlights of those films. None of that here and no hi-tech gizmos either. Instead, new director Christopher McQuarrie (who previously wrote the brilliant \"The Usual Suspects\" and \"Edge of Tomorrow\") settles for oomph over an actual story that lets us care about any of the characters. Even the whimsical team camaraderie we loved about the previous films are missing here with Ving Rhames and Simon Pegg taking a back seat (and Jeremy Renner nowhere to be seen). Driven by its strong action formula, \"Fallout\" will entertain the masses, but memories of which will self-destruct in less than five months. If that sounds corny, wait till you see the last thirty minutes...or the longest 15 minutes in cinema to diffuse a nuclear bomb.",

            "content": "Mission Impossible: Fallout is the best M:I movie to date. It just beats out Ghost Protocol because of its incredibly tense and well done action sequences, a gripping plot, brilliant writing and great acting.Mission: Impossible: Fallout is one of those movies where I dont see Tom Cruise potraying Ethan Hunt, I just see Ethan Hunt. The movie is so riveting and well done, and Tom Cruise's excellent work as Ethan Hunt makes his character feel real. Most of the other characters feel the same aswell because the acting is just spot on.I havent seen an action movie this tense and enjoyable in a very long time. This might actually be my favourite action movie in years, and is definetely my favourite Mission: Impossible film.The plot is very heavy this time around, just like in the first film. You need to pay attention to the characters dialogue otherwise, you'll just get lost. The villian, Soloman Lane, was previously in Rogue Nation, becoming the first Mission Impossible villain to be the main villain in two movies. Mission Impossible doesn't usually have the best villains, my favourite being Owen Davian from M:I:3. Soloman Lane in this movie is good but i feel like he doesnt have much to do, Sure, he tries to blow up several nuclear bombs with the intention to stop the water supply for three countries, but before he is able to try that, he is really just a McGuffin. Thats really my only flaw with thee movie and to be perfectly honest it doesnt really matter to much.If you enjoyed any of the other movies (except the second one because...well...that was bad,...really...really...bad) then you are going to love this movie!",

            "review_title": "Breathtaking execution! An action film that already feels timeless",
            "content": "Now that's what I'm talking about! How can a sixth film in a franchise be this phenomenally breathtaking? Well, by not being lazy and committing to the story and especially the filmmaking. If you're making a sequel, you better ensure it deserves to exist. Christopher McQuarrie, Tom Cruise and company outdid themselves now. Honestly! I felt like I was thrown out of a moving vehicle while watching this. I was that floored by some sequences in this. Films can motivate and inspire you, and I haven't felt this hyped because of a new release since... I don't know.. Maybe \"Blade Runner 2049\" last year. But that was of course a different type of experience. Too much digital green-screen locations annoy me these days, so one of the biggest compliments I can give \"Fallout\" is that here all the places are beautifully used.. And they are real! Paris, New Zealand and Norway. It's just jaw-dropping to behold. Especially when you get action with real stunt-work and ingenuity at play.But, look. The movie is not a masterpiece in every aspect. It's riddled with classic movie-isms and aspects of the plot have been seen before. But the execution of all the elements from the previous entries have been perfected to give you a thrillful helicopter chase with engaging character moments. Because remember, this series has been going since '96 (the same year I was born!) - That's crazy. Ethan Hunt has never slowed down, and I like that his character gets a progression. He doesn't just stay the same. No, he's evolved and become nuanced to the point where you can see the endearing side of him; And it's genuine. The happy-go-lucky suave guy we saw in the second film is gone. Remember that? Jeez - that was forced. But even though the character has roughened because of his life threatening struggles, you still see that he cares for his friends around him. Maybe more than ever before. Ving Rhames' Luther Stickell has been a part of this since the beginning too, and I never expected to feel that bad for him considering what he has to go through. Rhames probably gave his best performance here and I'm getting the feeling that Simon Pegg did that too. He's not simply the funny man anymore either. And of course, Rebecca Ferguson helps the team in great ways by giving an intense and impressive performance. The cast members have transformed into an organic part of the whole thing. I can't see any other people playing these characters. What else can I say, I'm just rambling on here. Well, the cinematography is one of the best this year. It's shot on film, and I love how it looks. The framing, the way the lighting is set-up and how the locations are presented are beyond this world. Oh, I can't forget to mention Tom Cruise. The guy's extremely dedicated and I applaud him for the great efforts in making this worthwhile. This would never be the same if he didn't say that each movie has to deliver something exciting and creative. Christopher McQuarrie hasn't directed many movies, but he has to continue. He makes \"Fallout\" feel like a very traditional movie. The lack of CGI messiness is gonna make it more timeless down the line. This is gonna hold up for years to come. Aspects are classic and done, but I don't mind it. As long as it's good and that you can care for what's going on - then I think you got something that works. It was also nice to see Henry Cavill have fun and play a different character compared to what he usually gets to do. It's gonna help him to not only be seen as Superman for sure.I've been praising this enough. But I was just so happy to see a summer blockbustery action movie take both story and filmmaking execution seriously. I was looking forward to see it because it seemed like an entertaining time, but it was so much better than I ever thought it'd be. So, yeah. Very traditional, but phenomenal execution of action and it plays out like a film that doesn't treat you as a fool. The last thing I wanna say is that I was shocked to see Preikestolen in Norway be used as a major location. It's up in the mountains and it's beautiful. But I was just there at the same place week ago! And I had absolutely no idea that they filmed there. I was actually thinking that it would make a perfect area for a movie of this caliber, and then I see this and get even more stunned. No wonder there were so many tourists there... But, hey - It was bizarre to say the least. Ethan may have hanged on the edge of the cliff, but me on the other hand... I didn't go that close. Anyway, what in God's name am I babbling on about? If you like classic great spectacle cinema, then \"Mission: Impossible - Fallout\" is a must-see.",

Not to mention the fight for authority. A sacrificial haed of the agency.

Did I miss anything?\nBut the screenplay is where they win us over. Bits and pieces of elements of surprises make us go wooooo hooooo. Even though it's predictable yet still feel fresh by the way it was shown.\nThe usual crew who has every bit of charm that need for us to love them. There is enough we already know about them. I absolutely love Tom Cruises facial expressions when the other people thinks his actions ridiculous or crazy.Swapped Clarke Kent instead of Clint Barton. Henry Cavill is the new addition which was well suited and cool in a way.\nGave the Superman hype here and there but ended up as Harvey Dent atlast. Half burnt face and death by falling from heights.Rebecca Ferguson melted my heart on multiple occasions (crazy for badass women). As usual Simon Pegg is the fun factor who made the audiences laugh.I like Sean Harris as Solomon Lane. Calm and collected. Did his part flawlessly. A genuine type of character.\nLorne Balfe did some things with brilliance. I had to mention it. It added so much to the movie. I liked the way he played with the original theme.Also I loved the minimalistic & occasional mutes during some fight scenes especially in the bathroom scene. Noiseless rendition made it seem like they were fighting genuinely.\nPure action with some breath-taking stunts which makes the movie so unique. Obviously it will be lot easier when you get an adrenalin junkie like Tom Cruise as the lead.Car & Bike chase scenes were awesome. Ethan spent a hell lot of time in the automobiles.They corporated everything with previous Ethan Hunt's experiences in the movie like hiking a mountain as showed in the start of the second movie.We too will get the question when Henry asks Ethan \"Will you ever not die?\"",

Tom Cruise brings it once again as international super spy Ethan Hunt, in the first film in the series to directly follow up the previous film. That being the excellent Rogue Nation. The plot of this film deals with the aftermath of Ethan capturing the leader of terrorist organization The Syndicate, Solomon Lane, as his followers seek to carry out the fanatical ideology of mysterious associate John Lark. This film is absolutely full of twists and turns, even for a mission impossible film and it would be a crime to spoil any of the plot here. The set pieces are bigger and more exciting than ever. The action is more intense and high stakes. Returning players Rebecca Fergusson and Alec Baldwin continue to prove excellent additions to the cast while the all new addition of Henry Cavil is absolutely inspired; he is the series strongest nemesis to date. And of course Tom Cruise gives it his all yet again performing absolutely terrifying stunts and running faster than I've ever seen him run before. The film also has the strongest emotional moments of the series since m:I 3, which was my favorite film in the series until now.In every conceivable way, Fallout takes the series to a whole new level. In terms of jaw-dropping stunts, intense high-stakes action and character depth, this film exceeds all expectations and brings the entire series full circle connecting all its previously disparate strands in the most elegant way imaginable. It's also one of the best action films of all time.",

This is just so obvious, and yet, because it simplifies the task of lighting the scene, this is what they do.So, this would have been an average disposable popcorn-muncher, but instead it's become, for me, a case of being barely able to sit through the rest of it. And the budget! $125 million, to make a non-event like this? With that kind of money, I'm sure they could have found lighting solutions that didn't insult our intelligence in this way. They think, nobody will notice, or realise that nobody would actually do this.

I was mainly looking forward to it because I've enjoyed the past two installments, Mission: Impossible - Ghost Protocol and Mission: Impossible - Rogue Nation, the latter of which Christopher McQuarrie also directed. He is the first director to helm more than one film in the franchise, and after seeing the great job he did with Rogue Nation, I was very curious to see what he would do with Fallout. I never imagined I would like Fallout as much as I did. Somehow, McQuarrie found a way to make the sixth installment be the franchise's best.

I have my doubts as to whether Tom was really flying a helicopter for the astounding final\u00e9, but the special effects for Fallout are superb, ensuring that this scene is just as exciting, if not more so, than all that has gone before.It's all so impressive, I struggle to see how they're going to top this one with Mission: Impossible - Dead Reckoning Part One, but I've no doubt that they will.

Superb movie with great, imaginative action. Plus the BD disk of \"extras\" shows many facets of the locations used and how the movie was made, including some deletions that didn't make it to the final cut.Original, July 2018: My wife and I were invited to a private showing of this movie in 3D at an IMAX theater. Man the sound is loud during action sequences, but we enjoyed every minute of it.As a kid I remember seeing a movie or two in 3D with the glasses that had a green lens over one eye and a red lens over the other. That was pretty crude 3D compared to what they use now. Now the 3D is ultra realistic and it was fun actually feeling we were in the scenes, not just looking at them.Tom Cruise will retire some day, I suppose, and most will remember him for his roles as Ethan Hunt in the long series of \"Impossible Mission\" movies. These are not to be taken very seriously, we know he and his team will accomplish seemingly impossible tasks, the job of the movie-makers is to come up with stuff we have never seen before. Just sheer entertainment.In this one a rogue scientist has come up with some small Plutonium bombs and tries to detonate them in a location near the Pakistan and China border that might kill one-third of the world's population. \"The greater the loss the more we appreciate the peace afterwards.\" The Impossible Mission team has to find the bombs and stop them.The last 30 minutes or so are the most manic, action filled I think I have ever seen.

It's just stunt after stunt, with some bad \"emotional\" moments that don't really work. I didn't for Ethan, nor his wife.They also failed on the humor part. The only time the audience laughed was when he spoke French, because his French was horrible (at a supposedly dramatic moment). They also exploit every clich\u00e9 possible in the action movie book. The last moment save, the crucial object falling near the cliff etc... It's very predictable, and very annoying. Henry Cavill plays a totally (spoilers) brainless villain. All muscles and no brains. And nuclear weapons ? Smallpox ? Come on... And you couldn't even get the Indian landscape right. You shot this in New Zealand and in the most famous cliff in the world, in Norway... You think we can't tell ? With not one Indian or Pakistani on screen ? Oh and Alec Baldwin's character dies... for no reason. And they just leave him there. Let's not even mention the CIA's director... Anyway, I don't understand why people liked it so much ? Were they bored of all these The Rock and Superhero movies ?

And was the plot at least half decent (Yes).As for the actors/actresses, everyone did a splendid job! Tom Cruise (playing Ethan Hunt) at 56 seems more fit & agile than most people in their teens, twenties or thirties (let alone forties & fifties). The insane stunts he pulled blew my mind! And although he was the lead actor in this movie, he still knew how to divert your focus on the other actors/actresses equitably. And of course Ethan's trusty sidekicks Benji Dunn (played by Simon Pegg) and Luther Stickell (played by Ving Rhames) did their part as always but this time with seemingly more seasoned acting capacities.I feel with this film it's quite easy to 'accidentally' give parts of the movie away, so instead in correlation with the other actors all I can say is you won't be disappointed. From Henry Cavil (playing August Walker), to Rebecca Ferguson (playing Ilsa) and more... everyone seemed to have been made for their roles in this installment of Mission: Impossible.

            "content": "When I say this is the most tense and thrilling action film I've seen in years, I'm not being hyperbolic. Christopher McQuarrie and Tom Cruise have created one of hell of an edge of your seat thriller that is actually an action film. Could they step up their game in the sixth installment of a franchise? The cast and crew have, two folds. The film plays out two years after the events of Rouge Nation. There's a job, things go wrong and the IMF is on case to find the villain and stop chaos. I was clinging to my seat with each action scene. I didn't know what was going to happen next and at times was anyone going to survive. They are shot expertly well, pulling no punches and leaving it all on screen.From the opening sequences the intensity is high and only goes up from there. This time they are teamed with a burly CIA agent played extremely well by Henry Cavill. He's such a good counter for the IMF team and he fits in so well with the group's chemistry. Even though they don't get much to do Rhames and Pegg are great when they are on screen. Rebecca Ferguson is once again very good as the MI-6 agent with her own agenda. The adding of Vanessa Kirby to the cast was excellent. I'm hoping to see her show up in future films. Fans of the entire series will definitely enjoy the nods to just about every other film in the series. I had never seen a film in IMAX until this. It was worth the wait. That final action sequence had me shaking. I really think the cast and crew went out to make a thrilling spy sequel. What we get is one of the best pound for pound action films of the year.",

This movie brings some of the old characters together, kind of enclosing the entire saga. And ended with a similar scene like the first MI cliff hiking scene, almost like paying tribute and saying \"This might just be the end\". Hoping not though. The direction was on point. The pace brilliant. I was always edge of my seat, so much so that my freind was like dude you okay?Only drawback was it did get a bit confusing in the beginning and it got over so sooon! Henry Cavill seemed a little off and trying hard im the movie.Other than that..its this years blockbuster!!",

If you've seen one Mission Impossible movie, you've seen them all, especially when you consider Ghost Protocol through Fallout. Now there is nothing wrong with that. The movie is made well and it follows the formula perfectly. But sometimes having a movie tell its story this well is not a bad thing. This movie lives and breathes for its action set pieces and damn do they provide on that front.The fight scenes are tremendous. That bathroom fight with Henry Cavill and Tom Cruise and their foe is a work of art. You can tell who is who and what is what. In a modern action film, that is truly a blessing. The actors are doing the fighting in most cases. That car chase keeps on going even when you think it's over. It is pulse pounding in the best ways.It also plays with the story details from previous movies. It carries the story from Rogue Nation. It also ties in with part three extending that story. These movies have never tied together in that fashion. They are usually self contained. But not this one. This one actually plays with the conventions of the Mission Impossible stories while still telling the standard rogue agent story that every one of these movies have done.As long as this movie still does the same thing though, it can't transcend to that next level. It does tell the same story we've seen before. I can enjoy the action but I'm not that invested in the story. Also I think Tom Cruise is rather dull in this one. He lacks even the slightest bit of personality he had in the previous films almost like he's bored with this. Everyone else is fine. I think Henry Cavill should get more action movies.If this is your cup of tea, feel free to indulge. It is worth the watch. It is fun and enjoyable. I give this movie a B.",

            "content": "In this iteration of the Mission: Impossible series, the standout of the film is the production team that was in firm control of the action sequences. The best segment was a daredevil chase through the streets of Paris. The location filming was terrific, and there was enormous creativity in the choices for the moment-to-moment action.There was also a fine batch of characters as conceived by screenwriter Christopher McQuarie. The Mission: Impossible team was great. But the secondary roles were well-developed also. Those included the top brass of the CIA, as well as a striking set of villains. There were also two intriguing in-between characters, Ilsa and Walker, who constantly kept the audience guessing on which side they would fall. The most interesting subplot was the mysterious identity of John Lark, who was being impersonated by someone in the large cast of characters.For this film, the action begins in Belfast, where Ethan awakens from nightmare about his past actions that compromised the safety of the love of his life: Julia. The action then shifts to Berlin, Paris, London, and, finally, to Kashmir in Northern India, where the climax will occur in the Nubra River Valley. Spectacular footage of the Siachen Glacier in the eastern range of the Himalayas enhanced the climax, where the matter will finally be settled with the terrorists who plan to set off nuclear bombs with stolen plutonium.As always, Tom Cruise was great in the role of the team leader Ethan Hunt. But there was an outstanding ensemble that was clearly built around the concept of non-stop action. Kudos are also in order for the sound designer, as the film was effectively scored with the traditional Mission: Impossible theme song.",

However, action is not for everyone, that's what I figured out. This movie is well-made, the scenes and cinematography are stellar and the scenes unfold with excellent pacing coupled with it's nostalgic score. But, behind it's cosmetic outline, lies a skeletal structure which has not changed much for most action films, which I find personally an issue for most action films. But don't take my criticism as me disliking the film, I genuinely liked it, just that action films aren't my taste. Therefore I believe a 7 is suited here as it's a entertaining and good film that we don't get much of these days, but sometimes movies are also about ideas and I believe that Mission: Impossible - Fallout could have expanded more on it's thematic ideas on the value of life.

I say good because that's where my only real critique comes in; the typical M:I twists and turns are a bit too predictable in this installment. Rogue Nation was a bit smarter story wise and I felt that Fallout stretched the story a bit too much... 2,5 hours for an action movie is long. Because of that I rate Fallout a bit lower than Rogue Nation, but that doesn't take anything away from the fact that this movie is absolutely one of the best action movies in 2018.I highly recommend anybody to watch this movie, a guaranteed well spent evening.",

Fallout favours more dramatic tension and intimate action, ultimately with greater impact than some of the overblown stunts of the past. The exception is the end sequence which treats the protagonists' bodies as largely indestructible and gives us another cut-the-wire-with-1-second-left cliche.There are still plenty of great action set-pieces but plot twists that are actually believable are deployed to good effect. Why, there is even some character development, without going overboard of course. And naturally there's LOTS of Tom Cruise running (and running and running...) Looks like the director read the study that linked the success of MI movies to the amount of time Tom runs.Henry Cavil was OK as a bad guy, though a bit wooden. He needs a menacing smile to counterpoint his smouldering scowl.My challenge to the next movie, save the world with 5 minutes to spare and still make it dramatic.",

I like to proclaim the Mission: Impossible series is the only movie franchise in history that gets progressively better with each installment and gosh-dang it, they DID IT AGAIN.And no, I'm not a child or adult who doesn't see many movies, so in both cases, their personal favorite is the one most recently in their mind. (i.e. \"Toy Story is my favorite movie!\"...couple of years later...\"Toy Story 2 is my favorite Toy Story movie!\"...and...\"Toy Story 3 is my favorite Toy Story movie ever!\") No, I actually mean it.I didn't even need to do the M:I 1-5 marathon I did this week beginning Monday with Mission: Impossible and through Friday with Mission: Impossible - Rogue Nation to remember. I know they all got better every time. And this incredible movie, part 6: the best of the bunch.While most of the franchise was sometimes silly, sometimes just for show and stunts and laughs, this one seemed the most adult. The most realistic. Sure, there are still scenes that just couldn't happen, or probably the odds just would be astronomical, but for the most part, I felt this was by-far the most sincere spy/action film to date in the series.By now, you should have seen all the previous five movies to really enjoy this one, though not 100% a requirement. Events and a ton of characters from ALL of the first five films are brought up here, most specifically #s 3-5. So, before you see this, it's a great idea to see all adventures first. Can't hurt as they're all good to excellent anyways.Ethan Hunt, still haunted by some of his choices in his espionage career, makes a fairly big decision early on here and sets a chain of events off to an exciting and nail-biting, grab your partner's arm until it's black and blue, finale. Literally, I don't want to give away anything that happens as it's best to go in cold. Like that Klingon revenge proverb. (Don't even watch the trailer as it DOES give away too much.)I will say this: I loved the heart, the depth of the characters, the action, the acting, intrigue, settings, dialogue, jokes and most of all TWISTS. My father went with me and he guessed a few things, but not all. I only guessed one twist, but for the most part I was highly entertained on allowing the movie constantly surprise me. I haven't had this much fun at the movies in years.I'm just thoroughly impressed with how they can continue to improve on their product, and even make these movies in record time - compared to how far the first several were spread out - AND still make total quality and excellent entertainment. I CANNOT wait to see this again and buy it on blu to add it to the rest of my collection.Cannot recommend this movie (and the whole brand) enough. Watch the first five and then see this. Or just watch this. At least, then it'll make you scream for more.***Final thoughts: Here's how the first 5 faired for me during my Mission: Impossible marathon this week:I - was good and better with age, but not without so many flaws.\nII - Better, but not where the series needed to be, yet. At least, Tom Cruise's hair looked great!\nIII - Fantastic and the absolute perfect blend of spy & action. Plus, had the series best villain.\nGhost Protocol: Definitely in my top 5 favorite action movies of all time and contained the very best action sequence/scene in history: from the Building climb to the end of the haboob. \nRogue Nation: Unbelievably better than GP (IV) which seemed, well, IMPOSSIBLE to beat. Better cast, funnier lines, better villain, great action and high on intrigue. Loved the character depth and both Rebecca Ferguson and Sean Harris oh so much.",

Each one continues to improve on the original (with a few duds, actualy they kind of match up in both series with the second movie being the worst).Yet, like Fast and Furious, Mission Impossible keeps on going with better story lines, new and lovable characters, bigger stunts (especially in this movie, Tom Cruise is a mad man for doing some of the things he does in this and i guess not really a spoiler alert that Tom Cruise does almost all of his own stunts).Really there's not much else to say that this is close to Ghost Protocol on quality and storyline, except with bigger stunts and the newer members of the crew shining (Pegg steals a lot of scenes in this one as he tends to do), with also the old ones still doing their bit supporting parts yet still adding real depth to what should be really just an average action film at this point in the series... It is basically like I said, continuing the 'switch' that happend on MI3 and just every episode is borderline like the original TV show... just keeps on getting better and bigger and such a fantastic movie all around, not just for an \"action movie\"Simply Put. I was tempted to give this an 8 but read dislaimer if you want on how i review. This movie again is kind of mirroring the Fast and the Furious. Each one somehow keeps improving the series (except tokyo drift in FF which actually brought us some cool characters for the later ones, or MI 2 which jesus...what a sloppy mess that was of John Woo's SLOW MO PEOPLE USING DOUBLE GUNS WHILE POPPING WHEELIES IN A MOTORCYCLE FIGHT GUNKATA STYLE???). In other words, if you are a fan of either either FF or MI series, (or an action film fan in general), this is a fantastic movie with a few sloppy moments, some script problems (nothing distracting), some plot holes that well, after 6 movies they kind of happen, but ultimatley, this is a must watch summer blockbuster. Disclaimer : People complain about my ratings... I tend to rate on a REAL scale. I mean 0 means the movie should not even exist and 10 means it's just something you must see because it's something MORE than just a movie. For me, a 5 means it was an average movie, worth seeing but nothing special, you will enjoy it or not. A 6 is \"above average for the genre\". So, a 7, especially for an action film, means that this is FAR ABOVE average for its genre, scenes, plot, acting, characters etc. Honestly, I'm tempted to give Fallout an 8 and i wish that IMDB allowed like 7.5 or 7.6 but well, they don't. So yeah, my 7 will make this balance out to this movie eventually being rated around a 7.6 which is exactly where it should be. No 8 because it's not QUITE there due to some predicitability based on the series, some sloppy writing at times, and some plot holes that, which aren't distracting and kind of start to develop when ANY series reaches 6+ films, it's just not quite an 8.... But it sure is close. Sure, I could rate every movie a 0 or 10 like everyone else does but um, that's not honest or possible. EVERY movie can't be 'perfect' or a total failure. Wish more people thought that way during their reviews, however us that review often get counted more strongly than the people who just post \"10 its awesome !!!!!\" or \"WISH I COULD GIV THIS ZERO STARS IT SUCKS\" idiotic spam basically.",

Well, personally, I think this overused formula will meet it's turning point where people don't seem to be amused anymore, so in order to keep people to the theaters, in my personal humble opinion, maybe Tom Cruise need to consider making the villain wins (like Marvel did with 'Infinity War'), or just make some story with an unexpected ending. Ethan Hunt is not a DC or Marvel character, but he is surely one of the (if not the) best hero in the history of fictional franchises or cinematic universes (he is definitely better than that pussy-riding James Bond).",

            "content": "I really enjoy the \"Mission: Impossible\" films, and was eagerly anticipating this new installment. I rate it on par with, but slightly below, the last film (\"Rogue Nation\") of the saga in terms of quality. The film certainly brings the goods with intense, adrenaline-rush action scenes. Viewers will gasp in unison as Ethan Hunt (Tom Cruise) HALO jumps out of a plane, embarks on a high-speed motorcycle chase through Paris, scales buildings in London, and pilots a perilous helicopter ride. Cruise still packs plenty of charisma and swagger playing Hunt, and the film's supporting cast is generally good as well. Henry Cavill, a new addition to this franchise, gives an interesting performance as the film's only character with truly multiple dimensions to their characterization.The main criticism I have of this film is that \"Fallout\" is the first \"Mission: Impossible\" film to treat its action sequences as primary plot devices, rather than treat action sequences as logical and entertaining extensions of primary plot devices. While the film is paced well and certainly has connective tissue between its action set pieces, the density of its narrative is a bit skimpy for a film with a 2.5-hour running time. Many audiences, however, won't care about this, as they will be so enthralled by how intense and genuine the action scenes are. Cruise, who reportedly does his own stunts for these films, makes defying death look remarkably easy (and I mean that in the best way possible.) Despite this key flaw, the action, globe-trotting settings, and characters make the film tons of fun to watch. Fans of the franchise will have a great time. Those looking for a very thoughtful and dense spy film a la \"Tinker, Tailor, Soldier, Spy\" might be a bit let down, but all others who expect not much beyond (admittedly great) action scenes will be incredibly entertained. And of course, there's something great about hearing that classic \"Mission: Impossible\" theme song that we all love with the sound up loud on the big screen. Recommended. 7.5/10Note 1: Here is my updated ranking of the \"Mission: Impossible\" films from best to worst--(1) M:I-Ghost Protocol, (2) M:I, (3) M:I-Rogue Nation, (4) M:I-Fallout, (5) M:I-2, (6) M:I-3.Note 2: I saw the film in Dolby Cinema. The intense Dolby Atmos surround sound system and Dolby Vision picture quality certainly helped enhance the experience and made the action scenes all the more engaging. That said, I think I probably prefer IMAX to Dolby Cinema (even though the latter has more comfortable seats) since I find the rumbling/vibrating of the Dolby seats to be a bit annoying. That said, I still look forward to enjoying future films in both formats.",

            "content": "The sixth edition of the long running spy series is another fine, if familiar, action adventure that continues to show the value of an evergreen leading man, who seems happy to genuinely risk life and limb for a better framed shot. Following a botched mission, Ethan Hunt (Tom Cruise) and his IMF team try desperately to recover three nuclear warheads from a terrorist organisation known as \"The Apostles\", acolytes of previous film antagonist, Solomon Lane (Sean Harris). Unimpressed by Hunt's refusal to sacrifice his team for the mission, the CIA attach ruthless agent August Walker (Henry Cavill) to Hunt's team, ostensibly to help, but also to gather evidence to further their theory that Hunt has been disavowed once too often, and has turned on his country. Although CGI has made even more improvements over the past few years, it's nice to see a film that invests heavily in practical effects, particularly when you can see it's the real actors themselves performing the stunts and not a double. This is further emphasised in \"Fallout\" as you can see the scene where Tom Cruise's ankle smashes against the rooftop and he tries to walk it off. Christopher McQuarrie writes and directs well, and his script acts as not just a direct sequel to the previous film, but also has a number of scenes and characters that call back to earlier films in the 20 year history of the series. I do enjoy how this series has been around long enough to have transferred from the age of \"sequel\" be retrofitted into the \"Universe\" world that all studios now hope to recreate. But it's not perfect, the plot is pretty recognisable, with its story of cross and double-cross being fairly standard for all spy movies . . . ever. The plot also doesn't really stand up to much scrutiny, once your back in the daylight outside of the theatre. (I don't write reviews with spoilers - but the questions are asked in a few other reviews for the film). Some of the acting is a bit hammy too, especially and noticeably from Cruise himself, this particularly struck me as, though he has his detracting qualities, I've never noticed him struggling to act before. Personally, I'd like to see them go the other way for Mission Impossible 7, rather than trying to top this. Maybe a smaller more intimate film where the team work together to accomplish something, rather than just facilitate Ethan's work. Either way, after six films and twenty years, I'll be there.",

            "content": "\"Fallout\" is the sixth and so far the latest film in \"Mission Impossible\" franchise. The franchise that began with shallow action movies, from the fourth installment turns into a spy action thriller and it is getting better and better, surpassing many of the cult Bond movies. The story is complex, and from the very beginning strings excellent plot twists which, with the superbly-directed non-stop breath-taking action, won't let your focus slip for a moment. I've never had a high opinion of Tom Cruise's acting abilities, but for these twenty years he has become the trademark face of the franchise and, at this point, hardly anyone could replace him. In particular, he must be acknowledged for shooting all of his stunts personally, however difficult and dangerous they were. The rest of the cast is awesome. Henry Cavill plays the role of a cold-blooded assassin. Ving Rhames brings the soul into the franchise and, in tandem with the charismatic Simon Pegg, even some extent of comic relief. The trio of \"Bond girls\" - Rebecca Ferguson, Vanessa Kirby, and Michelle Monaghan - by their very appearance makes you forget about the quality of the acting, though, if you were able to pay attention to it, you would certainly not be disappointed. And in the end, in slightly lesser roles, big names such as Alec Baldwin and Angela Bassett. In every respect, it is well-made and superbly produced movie but, for me subjectively, it didn't surpass its predecessor, \"Rogue Nation\".8/10P.S.

While introducing August Walker played by Henry Cavill was excellent though my own flaw with the him is that he didn't get much fleshed out like the rest yet still likeable anyway. The villain we know is very basic as well as the plot which doesn't deliver nothing new. Yet Mission Impossible does what a summer film flick can and without a doubt delivers some amazing stuntwork with outstanding and white nuckled action sequences that surprises till the last act. At times around the 2nd act of the film, I felt a little mixed but picked the pace back which got some confusion. The film can feel somewhat forgettable, though can be a film that exceeds it's predecessor. Overall MI Fallout is best of itself, loved the action sequences, stunkwork was flawless and amazing, kept me into the edge of my seat, very great and likeable cast and characters, some plot points felt a little confusing but I still loved this film and feels like a rewatchable film I would see again. 9/10",

The final shot in that movie showing Ethan Hunt (Tom Cruise) exchanging a yearning glance with wife Julia (Michelle Monaghan) at a distance is indeed heartbreaking. But Julia's safety is paramount and this is the inevitable sacrifice they had to make for Hunt to do what he has to do i.e. save the world. The opening scene of \"Mission Impossible - Fallout\" shows Ethan and Julia together, which you soon realize is dream sequence. But take heart. You will see considerably more of lovely Monaghan this time, although that doesn't say much as \"last time\" was a 2-minute cameo.\"Mission Impossible - Fallout\" is vastly entertaining. There is nothing special about the plot, the IMF Team's \"impossible\" mission to stop some devastating attack of catastrophic proportion. Nor will you even raise an eyebrow at the protagonist hero being under suspect of being the villain. The usual deadly devices here are three plutonic bombs a tad smaller than a bowling ball. The interested parties are the usual suspects: CIA, MI-6, a group of agents-turned-rouge calling themselves \"The Apostles\" and of course our own IMF (the non-monetary kind).The key characters each comes with a personal agenda. In addition to Hunt's loyal teammates Benji (Simon Pegg) and Luther (Ving Rhames), MI-6 agent Ilsa Faust (Rebecca Ferguson) returns but as a competitor rather than an ally. August Walker (Henry Cavill), top CIA agent, is sent to go anywhere Hunt goes to keep an eye on him. As a \"broker\" of shady deals is the mysterious White Widow (Vanessa Kirby), not known by any other name. But you know of course that things are not what they appear to be. You soon realize that the word \"side' is meaningless, in the context of who is on which side. The makers of this 6th in the Mission Impossible movie franchise has brought to the screen all the entertainment you expect, meticulously crafted. You get cliff hangers, in a very literal sense in the grand finale. You get a car chase sequence of the highest quality, in Paris. You get John Wayne style fast draw. Hard punching and sharp slashing melees you get maybe even too much of. For comic relief, nothing beats the running-on-roof chase scene in which Benji remotely steers Hunt, using an I-pad. There is even one surreal montage depicting what Hunt sees in his mind - brutal carnage in fuzzy visual, with actual blast of firearm replaced by poignant classic music. The line-up of screen personalities rivals the brightness of any constellation. Henry Cavill with a moustache you should still recognize. You will also know that it is unlikely that Walker is just there to tag along. After all, you don't hire Superman to play second fiddle. Rebecca Ferguson is the only \"Hunt girl\" (as in \"Bond girl\") who makes a return. That, in itself, says a lot. In all probability, she will continue with the franchise. The appearance of Vanessa Kirby will bring a small measure of pleasure to those who are going to miss her sorely as Princess Margaret in future seasons of \"The Crown\". And then of course the IMF Team as mentioned, as well as Alec Baldwin and Angela Bassett.",

Whether he's throwing himself out of windows, clinging to the underside of a helicopter or climbing a sheer rock face, he still thrives on stunts and adrenaline rushes as much as he did when he started this series 22 years ago. On top of that, he has proven himself to be a capable actor as well as a great stuntman. I noticed this when Ethan was talking to his ex-wife's new husband and he just made up an alias on the spot. Tom Cruise has a reputation for playing characters that are similar - Ethan Hunt, Jack Reacher, William Cage (although the latter character differentiates himself from Reacher and Hunt by starting as a coward) - and because of that I was kind of expecting him to just be Tom Cruise but I underestimated him. He interacted with Julia's new husband in a way that made Ethan seem comfortable in the guy's presence, despite having only just received a double whammy by learning Julia was there and that she'd gotten remarried. That scene was enough to show me that Cruise is more than just a crazy thrill seeker. I'm not a Mission Impossible fan or even a particularly big Tom Cruise fan so I just went into this movie expecting action, gun fights, car and motorbike chases and Cruise doing potentially life threatening stunts. We get plenty of that, which I think is all anyone really wants out of these movies, but Cruise goes that extra mile to actually make a decent movie in general rather than one that relies solely on the action scenes and his willingness to put himself in danger. The guy is clearly very passionate and devoted to this series and doesn't let the effects of middle age interfere with his work.",

As can be expected, the stunts are great and there are lots of chases. There are motorcycle chases-Tom is not wearing a helmet so you can see it is really him doing the stunts. There are foot chases across rooftops-Tom actually broke his ankle performing one of the jumps. There are helicopter chases-and even a HALO jump, or high altitude low opening. There is a fight in a bathroom that is unbelievable. Let's just say, it is not a boring movie. Henry plays a C.I.A. agent that has to tag along on Tom's mission-he has orders from his boss, Angela, to take Tom out if he fails. I guess the IMF and C.I.A. have issues with each other. Rebecca returns as an MI6 agent-she was in Rogue Nation-and Sean also returns from Rogue Nation, making him the first villain that has made a second appearance in the franchise. There are people that are not who they claim to be-that is in the job description of a spy's life-and there are people that don't make it to the end of the movie.\nIt's rated \"PG-13\" for violence, intense action and language and has a running time of 2 hours & 27 minutes.\nI really enjoyed this installment and would buy it on Blu-Ray.",

We are often swayed by the action and stunt sequences in movies these days ,we tend to forget the journey each character takes to reach the apex of his character development ,this is mostly forgettable in FALLOUT (read...the Batman dark Knight) ,the MI SERIES could use some good antagonist in the next movie .THE SCORE - this time its the score that has upped the ante of this movie,Lorne balfe has found a rich sound that matches with the fast paced storyline. it is adept at most scenes and does not lag in the tone or the pacing. Lorne balfe has a great perception when it comes to what is on screen and the right tone to match it.OVERALL A GREAT TAKE IN THE MI SERIES. fallout is the movie u have been wishing to watch with friends ,colleagues and family . go for this movie and let your weekend be jolly and entertaining.",

The unimportant archetypal Hollywood plot is Ethan Hunt must recover some plutonium from the bad guys before it, of course, is too late as a bomb timer ticks away. It had the expected motorcycle and car chases, some gun play, explosions and a countdown timer working against Hunt yet all of it was rather run-of-the-mill and mediocre.

            "content": "'Mission: Impossible - Fallout' is the sixth installment of the series and Ethan Hunt's most daring mission yet. Being a more direct sequel to 'Rogue Nation', does 'Fallout' deliver to full effect if this is to be the last?1. When a mission to obtain a trio of plutonium shells goes awry, IMF agent Ethan Hunt (Tom Cruise) must assemble his team once more and make amends before a notorious terrorist group unravels a sinister plan with catastrophic results. Not to start off on the wrong foot but one of the biggest complaints about this film is the story. I guarantee there will be NO spoilers but I must prepare any audience who goes to see this that the story is confusing if you don't follow it thoroughly. The plot/setup is delivered in an IMF message within two minutes of the opening five minutes of the film. Like always, these messages self-destruct once completed and is never revisited even in passing. Unlike the prior films, this one desperately wants move \"story\" out of the way and get to the action. Though I understand this is an action franchise, the story should take its time to play out rather than how it is rushed here.2. Like I stated earlier, this is a direct sequel to the previous film, so regardless of the plot, you need to revisit 'Rouge Nation' before seeing this or else you'll be confused as to the presence of certain characters in this one. Speaking of characters, one of the best additions to the cast (since Jeremy Renner) is the \"Man of Steel\" himself, Henry Cavill. Cavill plays CIA operative August Walker, whom (if you've seen the most recent trailers) I can neither confirm nor deny is either an antagonist or protagonist in this film. Let's just say he walks a fine line, unless you're able to predict and follow the plot, you'd know what Cavill's character is about and where he's headed from the moment he pops up on screen. Despite him being portrayed as a badass in most of the previews, he's not as engaged in the action or shows his true potential as a combatant unlike Cruise. So if you're hoping to see Henry Cavill kick ass in this film, you may be a little disappointed. 3. The characters I didn't like however, were Angela Bassett and Vanessa Kirby. Firstly, Bassett plays CIA director Erica Sloan of whom August Walker (Henry Cavill) operates under. We all know Bassett to be an exceptional actress but her character in this is as shady as they come and you dislike her off-the-bat. It would be different if Sloan had redeemable qualities, but unfortunately, she doesn't. As for Kirby, her character is simply known as the 'White Widow', an arms dealer who's apparently bad at her job. Though Vanessa Kirby might appear to be \"eye-candy\" in this, she acts her part like an obsessed ex-girlfriend with crazy eyes. Every scene she shares with Tom Cruise and the way she stares at him, makes you think she just might try killing him in his sleep. Regardless of all that, the best character and only actress (apart from Michelle Monaghan) to return for a sequel, is Rebecca Ferguson as MI6 agent Ilsa Faust. Though Ferguson doesn't have much screen-time in this one as she did with the prior, her story ties in with Hunt's more organically.4. Last but not least, Tom Cruise as Ethan Hunt himself and the impossible missions only he can make possible. These films just get better and better with its daring stunts and action set-pieces. From the Halo jump at the beginning to the high-octane helicopter chase at the climax, no other film can compare. Personally, the bathroom fight scene at the nightclub and the motorcycle chase through the streets of Paris were the highlights for me. I mean they were both very well choreographed and intricately planned that it felt more genuine and realistic than the rest. Not to say the other actions sequences aren't breathtaking and amazing, it's just preferences I guess. Though one might argue, when it comes to action, humor, a lighter tone and a more simplistic story, 'Ghost Protocol' is still the best of the series. I'd recommend people revisit that film as well as it delivers a better \"race against time\" plot than the current installment.For Christopher McQuarrie to be the first director to return for a sequel in this franchise, he does a good of a job as anyone. Tom Cruise definitely carries this film as he usually does and works the hardest for this installment in particular than I've ever seen him before. Some flaws are unavoidable when it comes to story, script and despite me wanting to see some interesting characters (who meet their untimely fates) return, this is still worth the price of admission. So go see this mission.......cause it might be your last.",

The story (as i think it was), revolves around Ethan (Cruise) trying to get his hands on Plutonium bombs, but in order to do so, he has to get involved in a plot to capture an old nemesis. As for the rest, it's hard to say, because there are so many characters betraying and so many organisations with different motives. It's a wonder Ethan even knows what's going on himself. \n Plot aside, there's much action to be enjoyed, but not so much as to deter from that confusing plot. The fight and chase scenes are among the best of the action and look so real, i'd be surprised if there wasn't lots of injuries in filming.\n As for the acting, well M.I has never been Oscar winning territory, but it is great to see returning characters Luther and Benji getting more screen time and both act well together. Cruise himself does a good enough job, but is really here as an action here rather than for his acting talents. Sean Harris however is great here and very convincing as an insane villain. \n Overall then a very entertaining film, of you get your head around the story that is.",

Suddenly, as I sit there in the movie theater, notepad by my side, the iconic Mission Impossible music begins to play and immediately I am sucked in.Mission Impossible: Fallout is the 6th film in the Mission Impossible franchise and by all accounts the best one yet. It follows Ethan Hunt, played by Tom Cruise;who has been playing this character since the first Mission Impossible, back in 1996. He's the type of heroic character that we have all grown used to. He's smarter, stronger, and wittier than any of the bad guys that he fights, and has a habit of getting out of any situation in just the nick of time. This time, after a mission goes wrong, him, the IMF team, along other familiar faces will have to combat the terrorist group known as \"The Syndicate\". With one or 2 characters from the previous movies, this time he'll be accompanied by the loyal Luther Stickell (Ving Rhames), the tech expert and comic relief Benji Dunn (Simon Pegg), and the arrogant August Walker (Henry Cavill), who seems the get in Ethan's way more than he can help. With that I can't give anymore away, without spoiling the last two films in the process . I do find it necessary to watch the last 2 films, (Mission Impossible: Ghost Protocol and Mission Impossible: Rogue Nation). For the fact of how much it adds to the film to know the relationships and backstories of these character, and in order to understand the characters involved and the role of which \"The Syndicate\" plays and the characters involved and they are also both solid movies that deserve at least part of your time.One of the defining aspects of this movie is the action. From the opening mission gone wrong, to the skydiving sequence that seems to all happen in one uninterrupted shot, to the harrowing helicopter chase near the end, this is a story that's told through its action. Acclaimed film critic Roger Ebert from The Chicago Sun-Times described it best, when speaking on the 4th film Mission Impossible: Ghost Protocol, saying that it achieves a sort of action poetry. The script, for what it is, is great. One of the best parts about is is that it allows for these action sequences to happen one after the other, and this fast pace keeps the film from possibly being bogged down by its complex plot or use of exposition. Another thing to admire about the writing of this film is the constant use of the twist. Things in this film constantly change from being one thing to the other and the same with the majority of the characters. There are constantly moments in the film which lead to my jaw being dropped with an \"oh my god\" expression on my face. If I were to give any flaws to this film, it would probably only have to do with the Mission Impossible franchise and the style of these movies as a whole. I find that some viewers might get annoyed with the overt complexity of the plot and action, feeling that what it leads up to could be done much quicker, instead of this film's length of 147 minutes (I must add that however long that may seem for a movie to be, it does not feel that way. The fast pace means that something is constantly happening to the point that this almost two and a half hour movie only feels less than two.). I can also understand some viewers becoming annoyed with some of the conveniences in this film, how Ethan Klein seems to get through everything even when by all accounts he shouldn't have, or how him and his crew always seem to get rid of the threat just 1 to two seconds before it would have been too late.In conclusion, this is a film for just about anyone. Its action packed but it's well-written at the same time, it's funny but also serious and melancholy when it has to, and it's a crowd pleaser but at the same time critically acclaimed (look no further than the 97% rating on RottenTomatoes.com). I remember seeing an elderly couple at the showing I went to, and seeing them gasp at the same twists, laugh at the same jokes, and after coming out of the theater looking satisfied just as I had. This is a movie that I feel has a little bit for everyone.",

            "content": "I haven't seen an M:I flick since J.J. Abrams got behind the lens in 2006's Mission: Impossible III. It's now 12 years later and I'm glad I decided to revisit this juggernaut of a techie gag franchise. Heck, star Tom Cruise at a Rob Lowe-like age of 56, is a lifetime away from any AARP BS here.So yeah, I'm talking about Mission: Impossible - Fallout (my latest review). It has to do with something about plutonium cores and saving places like Jerusalem and the Vatican from nuclear destruction. Cruise and company are back to light it up. They give you a brisk 147 minutes of pure adrenaline, pure poetry, lush locales, and some seriously deluxe, motion camerawork. Sure \"Fallout\" contains numerous twists which appear as though the screenwriters are making stuff up as they go along. And yes, the scenes between all the visceral mayhem seem like languid preludes or clear setups. Oh well. With Mission: Impossible - Fallout, it's all about the steadily forced engagement sequences that take a big fat dump on the concept of CGI. You know the ones where the director gives Cruise's Ethan Hunt tailor made chances to survive by the skin of his teeth. There's an aerodynamic motorcycle chase so brilliantly filmed by Christopher McQuarrie, you feel like you're in it and living it. There's also an in-your-face helicopter pursuit (and crash) that no human being could survive (but of course Hunt does). Finally, there's a bathroom fistfight segment with punches and bone cracks so loud, you might need earplugs. For reasons clearly evident, \"Fallout\" contains some of the most fearless and most outlandish stunt work I've seen in many a moon. I'm remember turning to talk to my friend at the theater and whispering, \"are you seeing this dude, seriously?\"Anyway, \"Fallout's\" acting standouts include of course Tom Cruise (except when he's talking to himself in airborne fashion) plus Henry Cavill and Sean Harris as would-be villains. As for director Christopher McQuarrie, well his staging of action is up there with some of the greats (I'm talking John Woo, William Friedkin, George Miller, and John McTiernan. All for different reasons). Too bad McQuarrie's mumbled script, predetermined chaos, and messy narrative for \"Fallout\" fail to measure up. Still worth a recommendation though. Rating: 3 stars.",

I can't find any flaws in the movie, however the plot is a bit complex and if you aren't paying attention, might miss something.

Look at some of the helicopter scenes and numerous other action sequences and you could be forgiven for thinking that you're watching a cartoon. Amongst all the explosions and bullets and fights and car crashes and helicopter smashes, Tom Cruise somehow never seems to get badly hurt. He jumps out of cars doing 110 mph and not so much as a limp. He jumps out of buildings from 40 to 50 feet height and after dusting himself down, is haring after the bad guys again. Not so much as a chipped fingernail. This is done time and time again, it really does start to grate. Where is the realism? I know it's only a movie but this is ridiculous. All good spy thrillers have a couple of really cracking plot twists that are usually completely unexpected. This movie has about seventeen million of them. And do you know what? I stopped caring after the first three. I think this particular franchise has run its course and it's time to call it a day. Get out while the getting good. Get Ethan Hunt retired and let him enjoy the fruits of all his labours.",

The stunts and set pieces are indeed a sight to behold, but the story and characters are so utterly generic that it becomes a rather detached exercise of 'I wonder how they did that?'. It's as if they began by storyboarding the set-pieces and then assembled the hackneyed premise as a perfunctory afterthought.Again, the set pieces are amongst the best in the business, but sometimes even these fail to impress, especially some of the combat. The problem is that in the world of Mission: Impossible, everyone has superhuman powers of strength, agility and recovery; we see a litany of characters, both men and women, beat the hell out of each other with an absurdly gymnastic style of violence that's so bereft of consequence that it wears thin by the film's second burst of tiresomely frenetic melee. As the The Raid series demonstrates, fighting, even amongst the highly-trained, is a nasty, brutish affair - not a balletic, bloodless spectacle of flying kicks and spinning torsos.This isn't the film's undoing, however, and neither is the trite plot, the real drag is the character work. Fans of the franchise will no doubt welcome the familiar faces and enjoy their chemistry, but to the uninitiated (i.e. Me), the IMF crew were so-so, and several antagonistic characters, namely Erika Sloane and the White Widow, were smug in a decidedly charmless manner.Still, despite the negative tone of this review, Mission: Impossible - Fallout is not a bad film, just an overrated one.",

If you want to see \"jump action\", watch the best: David Belle (the master of parkour) in \"District 13: Ultimatum\" (2009). Even stranger was Henry Cavill being cast as an antagonist. Typically this is reserved for A-list actors past their prime. I like the idea of using people who are typically cast as protagonists to be bad guys. For example, take Ewan McGregor in \"Son of a Gun\" (2015); a brilliant film. However, in Cavill's case, this simply does not work. He looks like a fish out of water. I think it would be great if Cruise was the antagonist. Sadly, I noticed MI 7 and MI 8 films \"announced\". Give it up, people.

I think it got lost in the messy plot of cartoon character action and poor acting with an uninventive story line.Please bring back directors John Woo, Brian De Palma or Brad Bird!!! and leave McQuarrie to direct teenage cartoon films. MI Fallout had no guts or raw moments and where did the sleek stylish filming and directing go? this wasn't high class slickness. This MI didn't even come close to paying homage to James Bond, where past Mission Impossibles' did! This film was just painted with 1 coat of cheap vanilla paint which was left to dry and then just started flaking for the next 140 mins. No trimmings or embellishments, it was just dull, plain, grey, ugly and boring.This installment in the MI series was suffering from a throbbing bad headache and nauseating hang over with nowhere to go but downhill. MI Fallout didn't really need any sound, you could watch it in silence and still know what was happening. You feel no connection or care for any of the characters and they all seemed emotionless & expressionless. Atleast Tom Cruise made an effort in his stunt roles, but sadly McQuarrie destroyed the Ethan Hunt character and made his personality seem weak, hopeless and embarrasing. Compare Ethan Hunt's personality in past MI films and you will see the change in MI Fallout. Michelle Monaghan's face was expressionless and emotionless throughout the whole film, even in a supposedly tense and traumatic scene while attempting to cut wires to a bomb which was about to destroy the planet, her facial expression does not change through the whole ordeal, its quite laughable. What a mess! I left the cinema angry, disappointed and extremely let down as an avid and faithful fan of all past MI films. The audience also left quiet and with no comment, they probably wondered what just happened and did they really just watch an MI film, or a comical farce?Terrible acting, weak story line, cartoon character violence which became laughable, awful CGI effects, bad plot, the actors didn't take this installment seriously and either did the film itself.Was it intentionally a black comedy that got lost in translation about 20mins into the film? I drifted off in the last 30mins only to be waken by crash, bang and noise. Oh yeah! I am watching Mission Impossible Fallout? or was I just woken from a bad dream?\nEven the musical score was as boring and dull with huge similarities to Sicario, but atleast Sicario's musical score suited that film and had purpose.There was nothing new and nothing to make you go \"wow\" Past MI films always brought something new and exciting to the table, but sadly not this time.What happened to Vanessa Kirby half way through the film? did she realise what a mess she had entered into and then walked off set? Alec Baldwin decided to die a quick death, with Tom Cruise telling him \"sorry you had to die Alec\".Enough is enough, I will go back and enjoy the exciting roller coaster ride on the past MI films and throw this one into the \"what a waste of time bin\" .3/10 from me, the 3 was for the location and fabulous scenery in Paris, Norway and New Zealand.",

The story is good and connects some of the other films without being dumb about it. In other words not overplaying \"oh there's and Easter egg\" . The movie just flows from start to finish.

Let's start with that Halo jump stunt in the beginning, Tom is the first actor to that on camera and it's just spectacular, I'm speechless yet again in his huge stunts. The rest of the movie is filled with other incredible stunts and chases that had me on the edge of my seat.

I started with that because although I enjoyed it, I don't think it's the best one in the series as most people do. I personally feel that \"M. I. : Ghost Protocol\" is the best of the 6 movies thus far. I'm giving it an 8 but that's because I can't give it a 7.5 and don't think it's a 7. Maybe a 7.7 at best. Ah, close enough. That doesn't take away what I do like about this movie though. Christopher McQuarrie does a marvelous job directing the action, as he did with \"M. I. : Rogue Nation\". There's great stuntwork and editing as usual. I did like some setpieces better than others, but they are all impressive. Cruise gives 110% as always, and quite literally throws himself into the role as expected. All of the returning cast are great as always (Pegg, Ferguson, Rhames, Baldwin, and Harris), and the new additions are also. Angela Bassett is nothing to be played with, and is cutthroat. Vanessa Kirby... ooh-wee. (She's good in the movie though, not just good-looking, lol.) But yo... Henry Cavill. Dynamite. Really liked him in this movie. He absolutely brought it here. The plot is sort of what you'd expect from an M. I. movie (they must recover some plutonium), but what this one does have over the others is that they seem to want to establish some more depth in regards to Ethan's character. The opening scene all by itself suggests that, but also within a conversation that takes place later on between two people (won't say who). Going forward in the series, those things could definitely suggest some possible stakes for Ethan and other characters. So I like that also. There is something though in this movie that I think is the best out of all the films and that is the score. Lorne Balfe composed this one. I say get him back for the 7th film. Fantastic job. My only reason for not thinking it's the best in the series is due simply to the fact that I thought the fourth film was more fun. A more serious approach isn't unsuitable for these movies though. It didn't hurt this one. Looking forward to the 7th film.",

I could even say it deserves it's Rotten Tomatoes rating of 9.7. The talking was fast and intelligent, though hard to keep up with. It was all mixed with humor and fun. I found myself wanting to instead put on an intelligent spy movie or something. I just couldn't keep up nor did I want to.The stunts I am sure were absolutely amazing.

            "content": "It's a little weird to think that we're already on the sixth Mission: Impossible movie, especially considering how far the franchise has come since (what I consider) its revival in Mission: Impossible III (2006). Since then, the action has been consistently impressive and the stunts mind-bogglingly intense. Fallout continues to provide on this franchise's promise of high-octane action and neat spy tech, even if the latter doesn't seem to be nearly as impressive as in its previous installments. Ironically enough, one of the problems I had with this movie was how it tried to interweave plot from previous films in the franchise.I'll be honest and say that I don't watch these movies for the plot. Sure, I'll follow along to see how the team has to accomplish the \"impossible\" in the form of setting up a ridiculous stunt. From scaling tall buildings in Dubai, accessing computer servers underwater, and hanging above the floor of a highly secure room, these set pieces were always what drew me to this series. The main characters were pretty memorable, but I honestly couldn't tell you about any of the tangential characters, especially the previous villains or love interests. And that's where Fallout lost me.While this film was also jam-packed with action, I also felt there was probably one sequence too many, and each of the action scenes were probably 10% too long. It was a bit exhausting having to sit through almost 2.5 hours of bathroom fights, car chases, and helicopter acrobatics. The stunts do look quite impressive, and it is clear that Cruise does most (if not all) of the stunts here. Although, at this point, I'm wondering if Cruise has it in his contract for this series to have his \"running\" scenes in these movies, as it seems to be an additional trademark of the franchise.A Mission: Impossible film that almost has too much action and too much plot, I give Mission: Impossible - Fallout 3.5 stars out of 5.",

            "content": "In this 6th installment of the series, the business was as usual; The Apostles (a reformed version of The Syndicate), a terrorist group of rogue operators from different intelligence circuits tries to get hold of Plutonium Cores to build three portable nuclear weapons to destroy the \"old-world-order\" by a simultaneous nuclear attack on the Vatican, Jerusalem and Mecca. Ethan Hunt & his IMF team mates join forces with CIA assassin August Walker (Henry Cavill) to prevent this disaster of epic proportions but soon they find themselves in a desperate race against time before it's too late to stop the enemies. As the franchise's signature elements, the highlight of the movie was edge-of-your seat chase sequences & intense fight scenes but what actually still worked for this 22 year old long running series was the way they improvised those tricks & filmed them so remarkably believable way. Moreover, it was also highly appreciating that less use of over-the-top artificial techs and more to realistic stunts put the gadgets to rest this time, and that made it more grounded than ever. The entire motor bike chase in Paris as well as the helicopter pursuit in Kashmir may give you goosebumps thinking that this guy did it all by himself! Therefore, kudos to Mr. Tom Cruise & the director Christopher McQuarrie for pushing the envelope in some most daring ways possible and making a movie like M.I: FALLOUT that deserves its shining place in the history of Action movie genre.\nAnother thing that I mostly liked about this movie was that one particular scene where Hunt's team confronts a female police-patrol officer in an awkward moment. The thing is that scene wasn't much an integral part of the story and they easily could have avoided it but I'm glad that they kept it in the final cut. It was very nicely handled and revealed a vulnerable Ethan Hunt who doesn't hesitate to draws the line & make the choices in some desperate moments that delicately uncovers the most humane attribute of a character like this.\nRest of the cast was great in their respective roles. Benji & Luther proved themselves as little more matured & experienced member of the team this time. And for Rebecca ferguson's Ilsa Faust, only thing I'd like to say is, from ROGUE NATION to FALLOUT, whenever she appeared on screen, it just made me think of what a loss for the 007 franchise for not to ever signed her for a major Bond girl role! This Swedish beauty got the perfect look & talent to fit in any role of an espionage tale. On the other side, Cavill already showed his talent to become the next James Bond any day in Guy Ritchie's THE MAN FROM U.N.C.L.E (2015), so I knew he'd do great but at times it did kind of felt like his character didn't much get the total badass treatment throughout the movie that it deserved (except for the Toilet-Fight segment). I'd love to see some more daring & twisted elements in his character of a CIA assassin.Without any use of hired stunts & CGI, this is another stunning accomplishment by Cruse, McQuarrie & the team. Personally I won't be surprised to see if Director Christopher McQuarrie become the next big target for the major superhero movie studios like MARVEL, WB or Fox and put them in a race to sign him for their next big-budget project.",

To protect the world he has to cut ties with anyone personal. One false slip, and the baddies can use this as his weakness.\nThis is the core question of this latest installment which adds a question to spycraft many have attempted and none have adeptly tackled as writer/director Christopher McQuarrie has. That is...are you willing to sacrifice yourself for the greater good of the world? Then why couldn't you sacrifice friends and family for the greater good of the world. The answer is bigger than ourselves. And injecting this depth into Ethan Hunt was a stroke of genius.Mixing man of the previous installments, Hunt, this time is haunted by a man who spins spies across the globe. The plan, in this case, is to create worldwide pain and suffering so that they can rebuild into the new world. That part is still a mystery, what isn't is the fact that the old regime just doesn't want to die overnight. The operatives are clandestine and very much operating on their own schedule. The rest of the world peeps in here and there (a policewoman scene is painfully touching) but we're always a few seconds from annihilation.\nHunt is a relic. We know this from this series and also...well, spy movies in general. What Solomon Lane, the villain from \"Rogue Nation\" has touched on, is that his sensibilities would thrive in their world order. Why not join them? The conflict isn't that. It's to create chaos in every facet of government espionage. Sorry if I'm confusing you, but this will make more sense the more you sit with the information.\nWhat I absolutely love about this film is the life that Hunt gave up for the larger life that he chose. And continues to choose. What was so confusing in part 3 was that he found happiness but his past haunts him. Here, the past catches up to lay to rest his reasoning. That he can't continue to be a clandestine spy and not eventually plant roots in life. This is what James Bond desperately continues to tackle, but \"MI6\" really allows you to feel the sadness of loss that comes with the emotional loss that goes with dirty people doing dirty deeds.\nA well crafted film.

As such I went along to see the latest installment, Fallout, with mixed feelings.Well I'm pleased to say that the latest movie is the best so far. I really enjoyed the movie which had some epic action sequences and some pretty fleshed out characters. My hat is off to Christopher McQuarry who wrote and directed the movie. He seems to have breathed life into the franchise. There is real chemistry between the characters and it is a really entertaining movie. If I was to sound one note of caution it is a slightly complex movie at times where it's difficult to work out the plot. Compared to how simple some movies are though we can't really criticize a plot that requires some thinking. Great movie!",

            "content": "Mission impossible fallout is easily the best action movie this year an maybe one of the best of all time. Mission impossible fallout is one of those rare experiences where you have high expectations for a blockbuster and your expectations are not only realized, they are surpassed. Whether it's a badass chase sequence or jaw dropping stunt work this movie always has your adrenaline spiked up to the max. The action is almost all practical and uses no stunt devils so when the action goes down it feels that much more intence. Another reason the action is better than most movies is because it progessively gets better with each scene until the ending, and considering the first set piece is a real halo jump all in one take with no stunt devils you can assume the action is amazing. However not only is the action amazing the story is very intence and filled with surprises at every turn. You never know who you can trust and the clock is always ticking and as it does that the mission gets more and more intence. I don't want to spoil the plot of the story because it is truly something special. All of the characters are fleshed out and put to there maximum potential showing there dark side and vulnerability when under pressure. This is easily the best performance I've seen by Henry Cavil playing agent August Walker in particular. Talking about flaws with this movie it's very hard to find any important ones, some nitpicks are that the comedy sometimes doesn't stick but the comedy is never put anywhere that undermines the plot so it's not that big a deal. And maybe they could of played up the conflict between two characters a little more but me telling you who would be a spoiler so you'll just have to see. Over all though mission impossible fallout is one of the best movies of the year and also maybe one of the best action movies of all time and is easily the best in the serious. Go see this movie NOW.",

I was aware of the award winning theme and that Tom Cruise was the front runner for the series, but had never sat down or gone to a theatre to see one. I started for some reason watching Ghost Protocol (MI4), and from no prior knowledge I had incredible enjoyment with the set pieces, thrilling action sequences and fantastic character and actor chemistry. Then moved on to Rogue Nation (MI5) with the change of director from Brad Bird to Christopher Mquarrie and my god... what a film. He managed to go above and beyond by delivering an intense, darker and satisfying enstallment to the franchise which in my opinion went above the quality of GP. So in my head, I thought there was no way that they could top this. How? I mean there is already so many generic action films out there. How do you shock and entertain audiences, while still maintaining the \"campyness\", that the franchise has kept running? While I never thought that Mquarrie, would embrace the predictable and excecute with artistic type film making. Fallout, thrilling delivers on action, characters, villains, music, and another satisfying entry to the Mission Impossible franchise. Cavill delivers a thrilling performance. Tom Cruise alone is a force to be reckoned with. It probably helps that we as an audience have prior knowledge of his insane tradition of doing his own stunts. Mquarrie takes advantage of this by shooting in a style that presents his skills and drive to entertain an audience and puts it next to a breath taking score and fantastically choreographed sequences that have set the bar for all action films to ever be released in the coming future.",

Similarly, Vanessa Kirby is excellent in her role as arms broker \"White Widow\".

            "content": "With the exception of John Woo's undercooked second instalment, Mission: Impossible has been that rarest of things: a major action-movie franchise which improves (or at least avoids diminishing) with each new iteration. 2015's Rogue Nation was arguably the best of the lot, with Sean Harris excellentl as the implacably villainous Solomon Lane, and Rebecca Ferguson the most engaging foil the series has yet found for the tireless Tom Cruise. With these two returning alongside the ever-present Cruise, Fallout could and should have been a slam dunk.Instead, it's a damp squib, bogged down by a plot that manages to be convoluted and predictable at the same time, alongside turgid dialogue and stilted performances.On the upside, Fallout's stunts are as adrenaline-pumping as any previous M:I film, with eye-popping visuals throughout, all shot and performed superbly. These sequences noticeably lack the innovative staging and high-wire tension which characterised their predecessors, though: the classic suspension-rig routine from the first film, or the projection-based subterfuge inside the Kremlin from Ghost Protocol.Instead, we get a succession of blunt-force traumas: big, muscular punch-ups, car chases and explosions. This kind of uncomplicated energy is fine for your average big summer blockbuster, but the absence of the inventiveness which characterised previous M:I films is a disappointment.When the action-sequence dust settles, this lack of ambition becomes more of a problem. Harris and Ferguson, along with the otherwise-excellent Angela Bassett, are given relatively meagre screen time, dominated by tedious exposition, unintentionally hilarious attempts at pathos and smirking pantomime villainy respectively.They're shunted aside to make room for Simon Pegg and Ving Rhames to go through the motions once more, Vanessa Kirby as Cruise's latest age-inappropriate object of sexual tension. and Henry Cavill doing his usual turn as a very angry man with big muscles who is incapable of expressing any emotion.All of them are pulled along by a plot whose strings are always visible, suspended haphazardly between those big action sequences: where previous films felt taut and incisive, and generally managed to fit some interesting character development between the tentpole moments. This time, we get some poorly-written one-liners, a couple of hopelessly signposted plot twists, and a bit of half-baked musings on Ethan Hunt's morals.The overall effect is deadening, and lowers the stakes to barely-perceptible levels. We don't understand or care about these characters, despite the elaborate peril they're placed in. An hour or so in, it starts to feel like the spectacular stunts have been left to compensate for the dramatic hole at the film's core; by the end, it's clear they've failed.",

The CIA has use for some fencer who is a 27 year old blonde woman who runs a charity in Paris and controls a small amoral security force? Who did the tall thin woman work for? Why did Ving Rhames character have to give SO MUCH exposition, particularly about Ethan Hunt's marriage life? And then we get to the helicopter \"chase.\" This was when this movie goes full-on into a bad Bond movie. Main characters easily survive helicopter crashes into mountains. And for some reason Hunt has to chase down a walker talkie to pull out a round thingy so the smart guys could cut a wire. I think these plot points would bother me less if the movie didn't take itself so seriously (ahem Tom Cruise.) The action scenes are pretty good, but you can leave after the London scene and not miss much. Forget about the plot.",

            "content": "Up until a week ago, I hadn't seen any of the MI movies, but after seeing the trailer for Fallout I decided to watch them all in short succession. I immediately fell in love with the series and couldn't wait to see the new one. It did not disappoint in any sense. Obviously all the movies are fresh in my mind, so I feel like I'm able to compare them fairly, and I can say safely that Fallout is my favorite. It delivers some amazing action, what I think the tightest and best told story yet, with some of the most wellrounded characters of the series. McQuarie clearly knows how to shoot and stage action, that was clear after Rogue Nation, but he's outdone himself with this one. Tom Cruise's stunts are excellent as per usual, but Henry Cavill has probably the best action sequence of the movie. The story in this entry is a little more reliant on the seeing the previous installments than the former movies have been, but is still accessible to everyone. That being said, the story is fast-paced, smart, and just flat out enjoyable, definitely surpassing most of the narratives that came before it. And finally, my favorite part of the movie was the characters, in Fallout, every main character gets a moment to shine and has evolved from their first appearance in a logical way. Tom Cruise's Ethan Hunt is the most notable. His character starts the movie as his usual cocky and smart self but gets more desperate and driven as the plot unfolds. The side characters of Benji (Pegg), Luther (Rhames), and Ilsa (Ferguson) are all great in their own ways and have plenty to do. My biggest issue with the previous movies is they usually sideline all the secondary characters and don't give them much development, but that isn't the case here. The standout is of course newcomer August Walker (Cavill) who absolutely stole the show. He was the perfect foil to Hunt and got I think some of the coolest action beats. Whether you're a longtime fan of the series, or first time viewer, Fallout absolutely delivers something for everyone, and elevates the entire franchise. NOTE: even though you can still enjoy this movie without seeing the others, the emotional impact for quite a few scenes relies on having seen the previous installments, so I recommend doing that before seeing Fallout.",

This is the summer blockbuster of 2018, and movie of the year! 2 plus hours of thrilling nerve-racking non-stop action, with only an occasional moment to barely catch your breath, then you're back on the edge of your seat again.My movie viewing has been disappointing this year, one can never believe the hype that's out there for so many films. But MI: Fallout is the reason we go to the movies; to be thrilled! (Let's just say I'm glad I'm not a heart patient!)One thing I very strongly dislike about modern films is the over-saturated use of CGI, it just always looks fake, and keeps me away from a lot of films. (I was dragged to see the latest Avengers movie, which I did not like, case in point!)\nMI: Fallout's use of CGI is minimal at best. We can see, and appreciate, the real work that went into making this film. So much, much, more than just the lazy use of a green screen and a computer. The true art of film making seems lost today. But that's not the case with this film. The makers of this movie are true to their art, and we the fans of real film making appreciate it!The plot is refreshingly complex, but not difficult to follow (if you pay attention!) So much more intricate than the usual fare of the latest \"super hero\" genre, which is really wearing thin. (The \"we have to kill the bad guys before they kill us!\" routine is getting really tired.)The best MI yet. This is what a great action movie looks like, with a few (just a few!) hearty laughs thrown in for the icing on the cake.Tom Cruise and company work really really hard to bring us a great action movie, and they deliver. Well done, cast and crew of MI:Fallout.\nI'm going to see it again this weekend.\n(I would have given 10 of 10 stars, instead of 9, if\nRebecca Ferguson had more screen time.\nShe certainly is a beautiful force to be reckoned with!)How will they ever top this one????",

This is even more so the case when there is no overarching story (unlike Harry Potter, Marvel etc.), every new instalment met with eye-rolls and cries of \"another one?\" (think Die Hard, Fast and Furious and several horror franchises...). James Bond is an excellent example of a franchise that has avoided this, and now we have no choice but to admit Mission: Impossible films also do not fit this stereotype. On the contrary, aside from the lacklustre first two films, the Mission: Impossible films have improved with each entry. Honestly, I thought it would peak with Syndicate, but clearly writer/ director Christopher McQuarrie knows what he's doing, since Fallout is incredible - perhaps the best in the series.It may seem strange, but in these films their supposedly \"impossible\" missions often prove to be very \"possible.\" Fallout, on the other hand, changes this; there are frequent moments where the mission goes wrong, making matters increasingly difficult and complicated. The scope and complexity is suitable for a mission that is said in the very title to be impossible. Not only is the adjective now applicable, but such a plot is much more engaging and enjoyable to watch; constantly fast-paced and rarely letting up, it's such an exciting ride which you can't necessarily predict. The stakes are high and it's so tense, particularly during the finale, that you can't tear your eyes away. Still, despite all this, it's not as impactful as it should be, since we all know deep down that it's going to end happily and Hunt will save the day - they're not bold enough to have an ending like another big blockbuster that came out earlier this year... Nevertheless, there are times where you find yourself questioning if they're going to come out of this on top, adding to the already immense excitement. On top of this, there are elements of the story that seem to reflect our fears today (terrorists, worries about nuclear weapons), but it never really capitalises on this, merely using it to frame the action and no more.As with most Mission: Impossible films, though, the excitement isn't really from the plot - it's from the action; and there's plenty of action to enjoy here with bold, incredible stunts that stand out. Though it may be a slow start compared to previous films Ghost Protocol and Rogue Nation, it soon makes up for it, slowly immersing us in a non-stop thrill ride. Each fight is brilliantly choreographed and performed, every punch making an impact. You'll find yourself wincing throughout the entire film - especially the brutal bathroom fight. In fact, it's that scene in particular where you see various characters' fighting styles. Tom Cruise, Henry Cavill and Rebecca Ferguson all fight in different ways, adding diversity to each scene and making sure the fights are never stale or boring (a danger in films with lots of action). Fortunately, however, there's more to the exquisite action than just fights. As we've become used to in Mission: Impossible films there are multiple stunts that are a joy to watch. Whether it's jumping across the rooftops of London or trying to hijack a helicopter, this film rivals the climbing of the Burj Khalifa in Ghost Protocol.Another strength of Fallout is how it's more connected to the franchise than the other films. There's now a secure returning cast other than Tom Cruise, including Simon Pegg, Ving Rhames, Rebecca Ferguson and even Michelle Monaghan (although it's a shame Jeremy Renner skipped out on this one). Pegg and Rhames bring some comedy and relief, although this aspect of their characters was underused. Whilst still not necessarily the most fleshed out of cinematic characters, they're lovable and give a stronger personality to the overall film. The female characters though are still the most underused. Ferguson's Ilsa Faust was without a doubt the best part of Rogue Nation and, along with Vanessa Kirby's White Widow, is one of the best parts of Fallout too. Yet again, Ferguson is an enigmatic bad-ass with a vulnerable side who commands every scene she's in, being a perfect female equivalent to Cruise's Hunt. Kirby plays a different kind of woman however; less reliant on her fighting abilities, she uses charm and beauty to get her way, but still carries a danger lurking beneath her performance.Newcomer Henry Cavill injects more charisma into this role than he does Superman in the DCEU and even fellow agent Solo in The Man from U.N.C.L.E. Suave but obnoxious, we love to hate him - and any fight scene is all the better when he's there; when Sloane describes him as a \"hammer,\" she's not wrong. Sean Harris' Lane, on the other hand, is not as physically intimidating as Cavill, but his character continues in a similar vein from Rogue Nation; cold, calculating and full of malice, Harris' performance is sinister - though still can't beat Seymour Hoffman's antagonist in M:I 3. This is still Tom Cruise's film, however (as well as writer/ director Christopher McQuarrie's). Despite varying opinions on Tom Cruise as an actor, I personally like him and can't imagine anyone else as Ethan Hunt - who else could carry a franchise for six films and seemingly not even break a sweat? In fact, this is arguably Hunt's best portrayal yet, as Cruise delves deeper into his psyche, looking at how his job and actions affect others around him.Mission: Impossible - Fallout is continuing proof that the films in this franchise get better each time. Though it doesn't go much further than just a spy-action movie, it has a solid cast (both returning and new), breath-taking stunts, nail-biting action and a plot that will keep you invested throughout. Fallout stands out as one of the best in the series as well as the genre as a whole. I can't wait to accept the next mission...",

Walker (Cavill) is the new guy - a CIA agent sent to watch over the team after they initially lose the plutonium.As always, the highlights is the action - there's some exceptional fight scenes here (especially the best bathroom fight since 'True Lies') and some excellent car/motorbike chases. There's also the classic M:I masks and possibly a quadruple-cross? I lost count, but it certainly makes things intriguing.The stunts are stunning - and very impressive, given Cruise is now 56 - and kudos to the director for leaving in the building-jump where Cruise breaks his ankle: it looks great & is so realistic! The helicopter scenes are exceptional and, as always, there's plenty of Cruise running. The scenery - Norway & New Zealand filling in for Kashmir, plus Paris and London - adds another layer to the action. Six films in 23 years seems right - not overload, but enough to keep you interested (there's been eight Bond films, by comparison). Very enjoyable spy thriller.",

But with the CIA's Agent Walker (Henry Cavill) sent to keep an eye on him, Ethan will face an uphill battle to show that he can still save the day.\nThe best intentions often come back to haunt you. Mission: Impossible - Fallout finds Ethan Hunt (Tom Cruise) and his IMF team (Alec Baldwin, Simon Pegg, Ving Rhames) along with some familiar allies (Rebecca Ferguson, Michelle Monaghan) in a race against time after a mission gone wrong. Henry Cavill, Angela Bassett, and Vanessa Kirby also join the dynamic cast with filmmaker Christopher McQuarrie returning to the helm.\nAlso: There's fresh blood on the scene. Henry Cavill, on leave from puffing up as the DCEU's stalwart Superman, brings unexpected twists to the role of Walker, a CIA agent assigned to watch Ethan's every move. And best of all, there's Vanessa Kirby (just Emmy nominated for playing Princess Margaret on The Crown) as the White Widow, a knife-wielding femme fatale with a gift for arms dealing and an eye for Ethan. Except he's still hung up on his ex-wife (Michelle Monaghan), who's fighting a smallpox plague in Kashmir.\nThe visuals, even in the film's more sedate moments, are the best the series has ever seen. Solo's controversial low lighting is brought to mind with Rob Hardy's noirish, moody cinematography, yet the darkness perfectly suits this material, introducing a sense of intrigue that has been absent from the series since de Palma's twisty-turny original. Fallout is, as ever, Cruise's show, but his supporting cast admirably round the film out, both with affectionate, often humorous turns from Rhames and Pegg, Alec Baldwin's returning IMF secretary and Angela Bassett's tough CIA director. Finishing the cast is Henry Cavill's Agent Walker, a lunk with about as much charm as his infamous moustache, his oaken, Schwarzenegger-esque physicality contrasted with Cruise's wiry frame.\nIf there are any weak links it is, invariably in the women characters - more or less pushed to the sidelines as tropey femme fatales and plot devices. Ilsa Faust (Rebecca Ferguson) proves the exception here as the MI6 agent from Rogue Nation with an agenda of her own - though even she feels a little underused. Nevertheless, the whole machine is so finely tuned that these quibbles barely register as flaws. A film like Mission: Impossible will never be considered high cinema, and nor does it need to be. But as the best possible version of itself, Fallout is essentially perfect.",

            "content": "First time (and probably last time) writing a review in IMDB. Spare me for my English because I'm from China and not even close to a native speaker.\n Big fan of the Mission Impossible series as I have watched 1-5 many times each, and I don't hesitate to say that this is the best among the six. I've already watched twice and is still considering the third time.\nThe characters are mostly from the previous one, Rogue Nation, with Sean Harris as the villain and the ever-beautiful Rebecca Ferguson as Ilsa. It's also great to see Luther and Benji, but to me the absence of Jeremy Renner is a pity. Many of the supporting roles are also very eye-catching, such as the White Widow and the female police officer. In other words, they don't feel unimportant. One thing I didn't really like is the fact that Henry Cavill is the antagonist. From my perspective, he just doesn't look like a bad guy. His acting is great, but it just seemed a bit weird. On the other hand, Solomon Lane was acted very well through Sean's unique voice and facial expressions.\n The plot is as usual, great. This time it was even more intense, with plenty twists and turns in 2 hours and 30 minutes, which is very satisfying. High-tech wasn't really emphasized in this film, they might have just run out of new ideas anyway, which is a pity because high-tech was a recurring element in the series and gives people deep impressions. Talk about the safety system which appeared in Mission Impossible 1 and the magnetic gloves and the moving curtain in the 4th film. Those scenes are all seen as classics. In this film only an upgraded version of the mask-printing machine appeared, which was never put to use.\n To make up for it, Julia reappeared in this film and got the plot running smoothly. The film focused more on the relationship between Ethan and Julia, Ilsa and his partners, which made the character seem more realistic and vivid. Ethan is willing to save Luther instead of the plutonium, and also there was a slight change of facial expression after hitting Ilsa with a car, and of course, Julia. There is just more emotion in there rather than just fighting bad people and saving the world.\n The film doesn't lack action fighting, but the focus was kind of shifted away. There was just one proper fighting scene which I have to compliment, because Ethan finally met someone better than him. There was more car (and motorcycle) racing scene than usual, which really got my heart beating. I was told that those scenes didn't use CGI and there were no stunt doubles. For a moment I was thinking Tom Cruise must be out of his mind. He rode the motorcycle without any protection and I was truly surprised and impressed by the act. One flaw: obviously we know that this film is sponsored by BMW, but it wouldn't be realistic to find a random car and they all happen to be BMW. Not just in this film (Range Rovers also appeared) but it was more evident in the previous films. Also, a must mention is the ever-famous Tom Cruise run, which took up a pretty long time in this film.\n One thing that the previous films didn't have was humor. There were plenty of scenes that gave you a chuckle and temporarily took your mind off the intense plot. They also leave people with deep impressions. Some scenes I could think of: the bathroom scene where they are scanning the face, and Benji telling Ethan to jump (also appeared in the trailer) among other scenes.\n I'd have to dedicate a paragraph to Tom Cruise. Now, I'm still a bit skeptical about all the no-CGI and stunt fad, but if everyone is talking about it, it must be real. And if it's real, then I have the deepest respect to Tom. As I mentioned above, riding a motorbike with no helmets and performing a HALO and jumping from a building to another and driving a helicopter in to a mountain having just learned it, that's just insane. It's unbelievable that he dedicated so much into this, just to make a better film.\n I'd also like to mention about the connections to the previous series, which is really exciting for the fans of the whole series. In the scene where the White Widow is giving a speech, she mentioned her mother \"Max\", which was the armsdealer in Mission Impossible 1, and her daughter was essentially doing the same. The last fighting scene and mountain climbing is connected to Mission Impossible 2, where Ethan is climbing a mountain at the very start. Julia is from the 3rd of the series. I couldn't think of any in film 4 other than Benji. Rogue Nation doesn't need to be mentioned. But what's really good is that even if you didn't know about the previous films, there are sufficient explanations to guide you through the plot so there wouldn't be confusions, but also not too much to bore you. It is a subtle balance.\n There is still much I want to say about the actors, the plot, but I guess it'll have to do. I'd probably say it's the best action movie of the year and definitely a must see.",

The bloke is so invested in acting that even a broken foot doesn't stop him from completing a scene. It is just thrilling to see him this phenomenal at the age of 56.\nMission Impossible Fallout doesn't have any separate memorable side-missions like all the prequels used to carry except the immediate prequel. I guess we have to accept McQuarrie's way of filming an MI movie. He doesn't really cash in on a sub-plot rather focuses more on the actual one. For him, the idea of an impossible mission is to stay with the primal plot, and it makes sense too. He has literally changed the way we have been looking at an MI mission. For some, this very fact could be bothersome while for some, it doesn't really matter.\nThe end you've always feared is coming. And the blood will be on your hands. The fallout of all your good intentions.\nMission Impossible Fallout has old school written all over it even though it is working along with all those latest gadgets IMF has. Everything boils down in the end to a cliched helicopter chase where the hero throws himself in the nick of time on a rope or someone in the team does something as intricate as cutting wires off bombs. But what makes it all different and why does Mission Impossible Fallout movie stand out?\nThe Direction of Mission Impossible Fallout Movie\nMcQuarrie believes in delivering a realistic experience to his audience. The fact that he doesn't resort to that much visual effects in order to shoot an action sequence just goes on to prove how serious he is about filmmaking. If you get a complying actor who never fails to impress either, lo! the circle is completed. Judgment is delivered. You get a complete cinematic experience that focuses on what's innate and not what's fabricated. Tom is his golden goose, and the magic seems to be working every time.\nChristopher McQuarrie satiates action lovers with all kinds of stunts in this new installment that capers around topics that makes all its stunts justified. It is a mind-boggling adventure of a tale that comes with its own twists and turns. Working for IMF and for so long (we are talking all the installments here) the team has become capable enough to outsmart people, and they do it plenty of times here, thus proving why experience gives them the upper edge.\nThere are close calls aplenty that will have you jumping on your seats. It also has an endearing love angle that places the two women Ethan loves and his boss in front of his mission and he juggles them all like a pro. There are split-second decisions to be made that Ethan makes unflinchingly. Plans going kaput that places him in dire situations and he always manages to come through.\nMcQuarrie leverages Tom in a way he has never before whilst depicting uncut original shots that will have you biting your nails off. Whilst Cruise cruises through it all dedicatedly and unfazed by what it might do to him. Such a level of commitment! It leaves you speechless.\nThe Plot of Mission Impossible Fallout Movie (Spoilers)\nSet two years later after the events of Rogue Nation, the movie starts off with a dream Ethan Hunt has where he is concerned about his ex-wife Julia's (Michelle Monaghan's) safety with the prequel's villain Solomon Lane (Sean Harris) by his side as the world speeds up into oblivion. With Lane in custody, the remains of The Syndicate forms itself into a terrorist group called The Apostles. Ethan is assigned a mission (\"should you choose to accept\") to intercept the sale of three Plutonium cores which are being handed over to their client John Lark.\nThere cannot be peace without first a great suffering. The greater the suffering, the greater the peace.\nCut to Berlin where he meets the rest of his team Luther Stickell (Ving Rhames) and Benji Dunn (Simon Pegg) to carry out the mission. Ethan fails when he chooses to save Luther's life over securing the plutonium cores which is stolen by the Apostles.\nNuclear weapon's expert Nils Debruuk (Kristoffer Joner) is captured by the team then and is tricked into believing that the nuclear bombs indeed went off and that cities like Rome, Jerusalem and Mecca were destroyed in its wake. Duping him, they take the info about Apostle's next move.\nAugust Walker\nEnter August Walker (Henry Cavill), a Special Activities Division operative who is instructed by CIA director Erica Sloane (Angela Bassett) to shadow Ethan for the rest of the mission after knowing about his debacle in Berlin.\nYou use a scalpel, I prefer a hammer",

            "review_title": "The best Mission: Impossible yet",
            "content": "Six. It's been six Mission: Impossible movies since it's first movie came in 1996. In Hollywood, usually, the series at this point will worn out and overstayed their welcome. A third movie in a franchise usually struggles to keep it's content fresh and exciting, let alone six. \"Halloween: Curse of Michael Myers\" and \"Freddy's Dead\" (aka \"A Nightmare on Elm's Street 6\") are among those horrible sixth movies, but movies such as \"Fast and Furious 6\" and \"Harry Potter 6\" (also known as Half Blood Prince), manages to break the mold and presents a solid sixth entry in their respective franchises.And thankfully, and rightfully so, \"Mission: Impossible - Fallout\" joins the likes of \"Fast and Furious 6\" and \"Harry Potter 6\" as one of the best sixth movie in a franchise. From director/writer Christopher McQuarrie, who also made \"Rogue Nation\", this is by far the most insane M:I movie yet, and might be the best M:I movie to date.Pros:\nCastTom Cruise... he's still got it. The good old Ethan Hunt is back, and Tom did such a great job portraying him. He's charming, he's nuts and he's got a great sense of humor. Henry Cavill is great as August Walker. He's menacing, he's dangerous and a great rival to Ethan (and oh boi his mustache...). Ving Rhames is back as the good old Luther Stickell, and he did a incredible job. He's witty, he's charismatic, and I just love his character. Simon Pegg did a fantastic job as fan-favorite Benji Dunn. He's incredibly funny and I like how he did alot more physical stuff in this movie. Rebecca Ferguson also did a great job as the mysterious Ilsa Faust. Alec Baldwin is also great as IMF Secretary Alan Hunley. Sean Harris also did a great job as the menacing Solomon Lane. Michelle Monaghan makes a return as Ethan's wife Julia, and she did a good job. Angela Bassett did a good job as T'challa's mo-I mean CIA Director Erika Sloane. Lastly, I liked Vanessa Kirby as White Widow. She had a great backstory and background, that I would love to explore more should a seventh movie is in production.StoryThis is by far the most complex Mission: Impossible stories to date, but writer/director Christopher McQuarrie made the story very easy to digest and understand. It's also tied up to previous Mission: Impossible entries, and that's a nice touch. The fact that the movie takes time to flesh out some of the characters even more, in particular Ethan, is also a plus in my book.Action scenesI swear, Tom Cruise is a real life Superman. Actors these days would do a stunt double for an action set piece this crazy, but Tom being Tom insisted that he does his own stunts, and it all payed off! The result is a fast-paced, adrenaline-fueled action, that's also real. No CGI nonsense, it's just Tom doing action scenes, on a real vehicle, doing real dangerous stunts. Just give him an honorary Oscar please. Major props also need to be given to Christopher McQuarrie. He knows how to make an action scene brutal, intense, and fun to watch. From the HALO jump sequence, to the bathroom fight scene, to a motorcycle chase, to a chase scene on foot, to the climatic helicopter fight scene, all of these were shot and directed beautifully.MusicThe music is wonderful, intense and great. Lorne Balfe did a fantastic job for this movie. This is possibly the best MI soundtrack I've ever heard since Ghost Protocol. The MI theme in this movie might have beaten Michael Giachinno's MI theme in Ghost Protocol as my personal favorite MI theme of all time!CinematographyAlong with Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom, this is one of the best looking movies I've ever seen all year. Stunning wide shots, with great looking scenery. The action scenes were shot incredibly well, using wide shots, and zero shakey cams. The camerawork on the helicopter sequence is incredibly well done, with cameras inside and outside of the helicopter, to great effect.PacingThe pacing in this movie is just perfect. They just go full throttle! There's no time to breath and relax, because the action scenes are coming one after another, like very fast. When you want to like take a break, the movie just kinda don't let you, it's like the movie tried to make you pass out due to the neverending tension.\nCons:\nHonestly, I've been thinking hard about what I hate about this movie, and honestly there's nothing wrong with this movie, there's nothing I hate in this movie, the entire movie is great. The pros outweighs the (almost non-existent) cons. If there's one thing I hate about this movie, it would be the lack of Jeremy Renner as William Brandt (I already missed that guy. Not appeared in Infinity War, and now this? Why?!), also I wish the movie could be longer (because boy time flies really fast). Oh, and in one particular scene it should be more impactful and sad, But since this is my personal preference, it wouldn't affect my rating whatsoever.Other than my otherwise personal nitpick, \"Mission: Impossible - Fallout\" is simply one of the best, if not the best action movie of this summer. With a great storyline, terrific acting and mind-blowing action scenes, this is easily one of the best movies of 2018 so far, and might be the one that finally took down \"Ghost Protocol\" as the best MI movie to date. If there's a seventh installment, I'll definitely on board.",

A terrific new addition was Henry Cavill (of Superman fame) as CIA agent Walker, a powerhouse assassin who fills that role mightily.Plutonium has been stolen and IMF must get it back before the bad guys reek havoc on the world. That's pretty much the general plot.An old villain returns to add gas to Ethan Hunt's fire. There is a mysterious broker who can get the plutonium. There's another mysterious buyer who confronts the IMF force in an outstanding fight scene. There are fantastic motorcycle/car/truck chase scenes in Paris. There is an outstanding chase scene in London. And of course, the combatants take to the air in an unbelievably taut helicopter chase scene through mountain passes.But Fallout wins because of the story. Ethan is still haunted by nightmares of his ex-wife Brigid Moynahan. He's still trying to figure out Rebecca Ferguson's role - is she trying to kill him? save him? What role is the CIA holding here? Who are the good guys, really? And can his arch-nemesis be stopped, or will he have the ultimate revenge against everything and everyone Ethan cares about?The last 30 minutes ratchet up the tension like I can't remember in an IMF film, similar to the fantastic villain Owen Davian, played by Philip Seymour Hoffman (rip) in IMF 3 around the mysterious Rabbit's Foot. Wow, I kept cheering on Ethan to try to save the world again. Whoa, the ending leaves you breathless.Fantastic acting across the board. Terrific direction to keep things hidden but moving. Great choreography and super fight/chase scenes, and a tight story that leaves you gasping at the end. What else could you want from an IMF movie in a series that still stars Cruise after over 20 years.The only questions remaining are - can they ever top this? and how much longer can Tom Cruise and his team keep going. At their ages, it can't be easy to get in shape for movies like this.Enjoy!",

Also we saw Rebecca Fergunson (Ilsa Faust) again and i loved her role more than M:I 5 (Rogue Nation) role. And as i saw, they made something different in this movie. The shots were not same with other M:I movies. They tried to make a cinematographic movie.

But Wait....if u have watched the previous movies in the series, you would probably know how they all were engaging: a pacy screenplay, thrilling action set pieces coupled with the background score and good acting. Although I have not watched the first 3 film's in the series (which is not a must), i still enjoyed Ghost protocol, mainly for that vertigo inducing Burj Khalifa scene, and Rouge Nation. So the expectations for the 6th installment was tremendous. So, does it meet the expectations? The answer in short is a big \"YES\". But before going further, the plot...Ethan Hunt (Tom Cruise) is back for his next mission, which is to track down the terrorist organisation, The Apostles, and it's leader John Lark who is still unknown. He is also given the information that Soloman Lane (Sean Harris) (from the previous film) has a direct connection to The Apostles and John Lark. With him on his mission are August Walker ( Henry Cavil), a CIA agent tasked to look upon Ethan, former agents Benji Dunn (Simon Pegg) and Luther ( Ving Rhames) and an MI6 agent Ilsa Faust ( Rebecca Ferguson). How they uncover the conspiracy forms the rest of the film...As I said before, the story is nothing new. But the screenplay is racy and thrilling and doesn't give you a moment to blink. The action scenes are the mainstay of the film. Not even one set piece were felt unnecessary. Let it be the fist fight in the restroom, the thrilling bike chase in Paris, that footchase in London or the climax action in Kashmir, all were spectacularly shot and a treat to watch in 3D. The movie also has a whole lot of twists which were engaging. The editing was tight. The background score was pulsating. The director, Christopher McQuarrie, has done a great job. A hatts off to him.Now to the performances. Tom Cruise has done a great job as Ethan Hunt, the most lovable rouge agent, and even at the age of 56 , does all the stunts with such ease. Henry Cavil was good in the given role and was at par with Tom. Simon Pegg is as always good, so is Ving Rhames. Sean Harris puts a good show. Vanessa Kirby has nothing much to do but the same can't be said for Rebecca Ferguson. The rest of the cast make their presence felt.So all in all this is a must watch in the series after Ghost Protocol. Make sure you make time for it.My rating : 4/5",

            "content": "Tom Cruise is without a doubt one of the most recognizable and iconic actors in Hollywood. During his forty-year career (already with a plus), he managed to try himself in completely different roles, trying on the roles of diverse heroes. At the same time, he is equally good at both the roles of action heroes and dramatic characters. And in both cases, Cruz uses all his acting talent. However, among the many roles Ethan Hunt's character has been one of the most memorable over the years. This character is a super spy who performs only impossible missions with his team. And the image of Hunt allowed him to reveal himself at the same time as a masterful performer of the most difficult tricks, and a dramatic hero, a living person with feelings, his motivation and zeal for saving people. This is not just some action movie hero, of which there are a dime a dozen. This is a true personality that you always empathize with, because there is a memorable character on the screen.The new picture, already the sixth in a row, was directed by Christopher McQuarrie. The same specialist worked on the previous part of the \"Rogue Tribe\" franchise. And in the film, the hand of this particular author is already much more clearly noticed. McQuarrie continues the storyline of the previous film, but does it more consciously and better. The director managed to turn past problems into advantages, his world became even more confusing and therefore more interesting. The heroes will have to dive deeper into the abyss of espionage, try to stand up against the notorious Syndicate this time, which seems to be able to penetrate into the very depths of even the special services.The picture retains the spirit of the \"Mission\" familiar to the viewer. Here, as always, everything is done at the highest level. The locations are impressive, the story is intriguing, the characters are charismatic and ready to surprise sometimes. The cast is balanced. The same familiar and such familiar faces appear in the picture, including Tom Cruise himself, his teammates Wing Rames, Rebecca Ferguson and Simon Pegg. The latter continues to try on the role of a kind of humor generator. It looks quite successful, defusing the situation at the right moments, which does not allow the film to be unnecessarily serious. Michelle Monahan returned to the franchise, which was a nice addition and kind of wrapped up the story. Actor Henry Cavill, a newcomer to Hunt's world, coped well with his role. Superman decided to try himself in a new role, replacing the famous red and blue suit with a mustache, shirt and tie of August Volker. It turned out pretty cool, especially his work paired with Tom Cruise. Both men went out of their way to give the audience really worthwhile scenes in this picture.The film is not an ordinary beautiful blockbuster, which is designed to give a great picture, a lot of tricks, chases, fights and at the same time collect a good box office. The film certainly does all of this. However, the message of the picture is much deeper. Viewers can observe their own complex world, where, first of all, Ethan Hunt's team is fighting for peace, but at the same time for themselves and their loved ones, which are team members. Each of the actors conveys this camaraderie well, offering the audience to see a truly strong team, where danger can affect anyone, and in order to cope, you should become one.The film is impressive. This is another high-quality work from Tom Cruise and his team. Surprisingly, no matter how many films of the \"Mission Impossible\" franchise were released, they all turned out to be successful, both financially and in terms of the development of the story. This is a film where a number of native heroes are already active, and the creators successfully maneuver at the junction of genres, successfully intertwining a spy thriller, a spectacular action movie and an excellent drama.8 out of 10.",

Although there's some lovely location shooting it never feels like we're in any real place (they go to the Himalayas and we don't see a single local person! - mind you I suspect that, as with Carry On Up The Khyber, it's actually Snowdonia). Tom Cruise has star quality, sure, but hasn't entirely managed to shed his frat boy persona and become a grown-up James Bond type. The action relies a lot on CGI, and there's relatively little fighting (the MO of most action movies these days). Despite the outwardly frenetic pace, a lot of the time it feels like the story is not getting anywhere. And they're far too long, as if to make up in running time the relatively long gaps between films.This one isn't easy to differentiate from the others. It could have made more use of action siren Vanessa Kirby - who looks like she'd eat Tom Cruise for breakfast - and less of wooden plank Henry Cavill, who surely demonstrates conclusively why he shouldn't be the next Bond. Reprising her role as a British agent, Rebecca Ferguson's not-quite English accent adds to the general air of nothing being real. They chase around, on foot, on motorbikes, in cars, in helicopters; but, even when it looks like two (not one, two!) nuclear bombs are about to explode you somehow don't feel a moment's real tension.At least they're not po-faced like the Bournes.",

            "content": "\"Mission: Impossible\" franchise is about presenting Tom Cruise as near-invincible hero Ethan Hunt who can pull off incredible stunts and seems impervious to pain and physical damage.This time he's fighting a new threat to the world... blah blah blah... look, a bad guy!.... agents outwitting each other... what makes one a terrorist anyway?... blah... you get the picture. Something or other is happening and there's plenty of evil henchmen to kill and backstabbers to reveal, before taking on the big boss.Also appearing, Henry Cavill, Simon Pegg, Ving Rhames, Sean Harris, Rebecca Ferguson, Vanessa Kirby, Bridget Moynahan, Alec Baldwin, Angela Bassett, Wes Bentley.The most interesting character is Vanessa Kirby's White Widow - if we can talk about characters in a story so thin, instead of roughly drawn sketches which have mostly decorative function in places where Cruise is supposed to come and kick ass.And he does, and still very well, although he must have been 54 or 55 during the filming. It's safe to assume that there's another fight left in him to continue with \"M:I\" for at least five to ten years, and maybe also do \"Jack Reacher 3\".And why not - the first five \"M:I\" chapters have brought close to 2.7 billion USD from box office, and the sixth one has also started strongly indeed.If you are able to specifically remember some of the most physics-defyingly insane moments and setpieces of the \"M:I\" series, then you might conclude that it would be really difficult to top the previous highlights.It seems that the producers and authors of \"Fallout\" have understood that and have not even tried to set new records, instead settling for just high-quality action scenes, most of which take place during the high-speed car and bike chases, or in the air.As expected, the whole long movie is full of cool moments that make the viewers' palms sweaty - still very unreal but not as absurdly so as, say, \"Fast and Furious\" or \"xXx\". Still, a lot of quality action for one's time and money.And so it goes, intrinsically not different from any other \"M:I\" movies, the first excluded. But no need to invent a wheel if the current wheel is rolling so nicely, is there?If I can think of any real complaints, I'd make it shorter. 147 minutes is a lot of screen time for a story signifying so little. Still, it's the most captivating action movie released in 2018 that I've seen.",

            "content": "We should all take a moment and realise how lucky we really are to have the Mission Impossible franchise, it is the very essence of what a modern day blockbuster should be. Brilliant action, great twist, over the top story and all over great acting, comes together for a fun and bloody entertaining time at the cinema. Is there really another film franchise like it?? It is extremely rare that a film franchise, such as this one, gets better with every entry.............well apart from MI 2 which I think we should all try and forget about. Brushing over that I am very pleased to say that since MI 3 every Mission Impossible has been better than its predecessor and that trend has continued without Fallout. I know its cliche but this is the best film in the franchise for some very good reasons.Firstly Christopher McQuarrie has directed a beautiful, fun and thoroughly entertaining film from start to finish. The directing is sublime with some incredibly complex action set pieces that are shot perfectly, with a mixture of wide shots and close ups. Showing fantastic angles to the breathtaking locations or stunts that are being performed. The most important takeaway I have from his directing is the fact it is so tonally different to Rogue Nation, which he also directed. Being the first Mission director to come back I was worried that this film would feel to much like Rogue Nation, which is not a bad thing but every entry does and should have a different feel. This one certainly does, fantastic job all round.Lets move onto probably one of the greatest actors to have ever lived in Tom Cruise, say what you will about his private life, but he really is the last big movie star . I highly doubt that there will ever be anyone else quiet like him. As per usual he is fantastic in the role of Ethan Hunt, I don't think he has ever phoned in a performance in this franchise. The heart and soul of every film he knows how to carry a story and a cast with him along the journey. The stunts are truly breathtaking and a wonder to watch, we should be extremely thankful to him for going the extra mile just for our entertainment. No other actors would go to these lengths to do these stunts its something that should be championed and honoured. Or is that to much??? I think that general audience just take it for granted but the time and effort that is but into these films is immense. Not everything is done on green screen!The other cast members Simon Pegg, Ving Rhames, Sean Harris, Alec Baldwin, Angela Bassett, Vanessa Kirby and Michelle Monaghan are all really good in their either reprising or new roles. However there are two others that just stand a little above them, firstly Rebecca Ferguson who is perfect in the role as Ilsa. She brings such energy and heart to the story in both this film and Rogue Nation, I'm so glad that she was brought back in this film, and she was used in the best way. Her story arc throughout this film is really strong/emotional and has a nice ending. Easily one of the best characters that the franchise has had. The other is Henry Cavill, and his infamous moustache, plays a role that has much more to it that you first think. There is a scene in the film involving Sean Harris and masks, thats all I will say...... genius on McQuarries part, I personally didn't see it coming until Cavill says \"men in halloween masks\" or something like that.Overall this film is 80% out of 100 or 8 out of 10, very good film throughout. The directing is top notch, action enthralling and jaw dropping, acting top class throughout. The franchise keeps getting better and better, the best one to date I have to say. There is only one slight negative I have about the film and that is........its about 20 minutes to long but apart from that it is a true joy to watch. Funny, jaw dropping, noisy, over the top and out of this world stylish......this is what a true modern blockbuster should be!",

To me it seemed there was way too much wit in the writing, forcing the actors to say things in very unnatural ways. Worst of all was Henry Cavill's \"performance\", which I found to be deeply unconvincing and not at all charming as the bad guy.\nTom Cruise was Tom Cruise, and I think it worked on some levels and did not on others.\nThe supporting cast were performing well.Well, you get bang for buck in terms of action and wonderfully looking effects, but a rather cheap script for my taste compromises the overall quality of the film, especially considering this alongside great action films.",

But it's not all about Mr. Cruise's feats, but also behind his amazing stunts there is a great cast that supports him greatly, a story that keeps surpassing itself with each outing, and the thrilling action that never stops. The bathroom fighting scene is one of the highlights of the film, I truly enjoyed that, that is how you're supposed to do a fighting scene.Was this the best action film of 2018? I genuinely think so. It almost makes you think about beautifully done action secuences that deserve to be regarded as true art. My only regret is to not have watched it on the big screen. It is well-shot and virtually exempt of CGI, which gives the action an authentic feel. The characters feel as if they have evolved from previous films and they give a more mature tone to the film.To be honest, I really don't see how they could top this entry. This is a franchise that might have reached its quality peak. Or maybe not, who knows? Ethan Hunt's story is definitely not over and when the time comes to end the story, it has to go with fireworks.

Most of the summer flicks are forgettable, meaning you enjoy it once in the theatre and that's about it. But Fallout is different. There's a psychological aspect to it. We don't get action scenes at the expense of certain characters (well even though the action sequences are something we haven't seen before). And coming to the action sequences and stunts, boy oh boy! They're too bloody awesome and guess what, ALL OF THEM WERE ACTUALLY PERFORMED! HOLY HELL! From that incredible HALO jump to the final helicopter scene, all of them were actually filmed with the actual actors. \nTom Cruise is at his best... at 56. The stunts he's preformed for this film are surreal. Henry Cavill is an actual badass. That bathroom brawl is one of the best action sequences I've ever seen, period. Simon Pegg's Benji is great as always. Sean Harris as Solomon Lane is all the more menacing in this film than ever. \nAnd the cinematography is phenomenal. We go from Berlin to Paris and then to London. And finally, to Kashmir. Everything is beautifully captured and is a visual treat.\nLike everything make this one of the best ever action thrillers. You have a storyline which makes sense, really good cinematography, a dope track, memorable characters and probably the best ever action scenes!

The tv series was about a TEAM of experts working together to accomplish a difficult task. This is mostly about one person, one super Rambo person, getting the job done. I don't care how big Tom Cruise's name is.....that just rubs me wrong. Secondly, the last action scene with the helicopter was way too long and definitely over the top to the point of it being comical to me. In other words, it took from allowing me the chance to believe this scene. The two previous car scenes were pretty unbelievable as well, but at least they both didn't distract me, and actually were quite enjoyable to view. I can't say that about the unrealistic helicopter scene that dragged on for more than the 15 minutes on the clock. Okay, I guess I said enough, but I still highly recommend the movie if you like action with some twists and political intrigue. Oh, one more thing....Vanessa Kirby is smoking hot even as a blond.

Yet, it somehow manages to remain entertaining no matter how many times this franchise comes round to do practically the exact same thing but dialed even further up.Fallout was no difference, it was a very stylized and fun action/thriller that featured over the top, risk taking set pieces and fun, likeable characters. Tom Cruise owns this franchise at this point, it is synonymous with him as he is with it and this time round was as always the Tom Cruise show as we see him doing one dangerous thing after the next. A returning Simon Pegg and Rebecca Ferguson were once again great in their supporting roles and I really enjoyed the new addition of Henry Cavill.At the end of the day this is a big, fun adrenaline fueled action movie that is definitely fun and enjoyable but I couldn't tell you much of the plot beyond 'Ethan Hunt has to kill the bad guys'.

As for the performance of each character and the Stunt scene, the whole process of the story is to observe that there is little use of CGI. And what I like about this in another is that from the beginning to the end, there are squads, shootouts, riding motorbikes, and helicopters jumping from the high skyscrapers, which leads to this. Suitable with 4DX and IMAX. Hope everyone is happy to share my interest!\n# 4DX #IMAX #MoviereviewKH #MissionImpossibleKH",

Believable, charming, and a powerhouse. I will say this, his zest for doing stunts is outrageously fun to watch. He has all my respect because there were timeS with an S I said WOW! outloud. He truly gives it his all for his craft to give the audience something special everytime and draw them in closer. The rest of the team is equally fantastic. I can't get enough of Rebecca Ferguson. She is a pure pleasure to watch. This movie is long, but there is so much to be had and something for everyone. I can't say enough good thing about this film. Mr. Mcquarrie writing and direction are fantastic and someone who DC should look to to bring on to direct Mr Cavill in the next Superman.

            "content": "Surprisingly, I kept up with the Mission Impossible series since its debut with Brian De Palma's first entry to the series. I thought the direction was weird, felt nothing like the series, but the action was decent. Then part 2 came out and the only reason why I saw that was because it was directed by John Woo. That one wasn't that great. Then the third came out, and like I thought, Philip Seymour Hoffman's villainous portrayal was the best part of the movie. Then Ghost Protocol came out and it was probably one of the best action movies I ever seen and Rogue Nation was no slacker either. So now here we are, with the sixth installment, and it's still a great series.Basically, the movie is about Ethan Hunt (Tom Cruise) and his team of Simon Pegg, Ving Rhames, and new recruit Henry Cavill trying to find three pieces of plutonium before the world is annihilated. Some twists and turns happen, but let's face it, you go these movies for the action and it delivers. Early on, there is a cool bathroom fight that almost reminds me of the bathroom fight in True Lies. You even get a scene where Tom Cruise is running. I'm actually shocked that there is no scene in this one where Tom Cruise is dangling in some restricted area. I guess they ran out of ideas for those scenes since they've practically been in every single one of these films unless I missed something. I really don't have too much complaints with this one. If you are in the mood for a summer blockbuster, see it. If you are a fan of the series, definitely see it. The performances are all great, especially Henry Cavill, and it's over two hours of a good time. So far, this is the best movie of the summer for me.",

This is one the same level as the 3rd one. Great action, great pacing, good soundtrack, very cool chasing scenes. There is almost never a dull moment in this movie, which is what I like. I don't really care about deep dialogues, reading between the lines and political crap. Just give me great action scenes, stunning visuals and great filming locations. This movie really doesn't disappoint in that those regards. Highly receommended if you like action moves. The only downside is Cruise is starting to look older, but he stilll looks awsome for a guy over 50! Very cool he's also still doing movies like this, unlike many other great action movie stars of the past (Are you reading this Bruce? :))",

The many sequels are criticized for not carrying the same magic or for not adding anything new or intriguing. However, Fallout provides an excellent time with thrills and stunts beyond what the franchise has shown before. The most interesting part to me was how the movie correctly used the character's' pasts to help build what may have been the strongest storyline for the franchise. I feel that other sequels could do the same thing by building off of the magic made in the original while using the history of the characters to influence the plot. Fallout also had a great score which surprised me a bit, in a good way. Every stunt or reveal is topped by a piece that elevates the scene to intense heights. The cinematography was the best of the franchise with many stunts and fights filmed as one shots which puts the viewer right at the feet of Ethan Hunt's various quarrels. Overall I gave this movie a 9/10 because it shows how a sequel can surpass views on the original and because it was one of the best action movies of recent times (in the same tier as John Wick and the sequels).",

            "review_title": "The Most Impossible Mission Yet",
            "content": "97Quite frankly, the only thing I thought to myself as I walked out of the theater after seeing MISSION: IMPOSSIBLE - FALLOUT was \"wow, I wish I could have seen that in IMAX.\" Unfortunately, I live in a small rural town in a pretty rural state, which means that the closest IMAX theater is about an hour and fifteen minutes away - and I don't have a car. Furthermore, having rewatched all the MISSION: IMPOSSIBLE films in the last few days, I just couldn't wait any longer. But I'm glad I finally saw FALLOUT because it truly is the best action film since MAD MAX: FURY ROAD. The film starts off with a bang - literally, and the first twenty minutes provide some of the darkest moments this series has had to offer. In these films, the world has been close to destruction time and time again, but writer-director Christopher McQuarrie establishes a much more genuine threat this time around, imbuing the film with a darker tone than any of its predecessors. And it works. The stakes are higher. The situations these characters find themselves are in much more intense. Their lives have never been in more danger.That's not to say that the film becomes too dour for its own good (after all, the great Simon Pegg is still around), but McQuarrie understands what he needs to do to keep the audience invested in a franchise that is still going strong over 20 years after the original's release. The setpieces in this film are absolutely jaw-dropping, from the bathroom fight in Paris to the helicopter chase in Kashmir and everything in between. McQuarrie truly elevates action filmmaking to the next level, seamlessly weaving action and story to create an astonishing final product - one that leaves every other MISSION: IMPOSSIBLE film in the dust. To think that Tom Cruise is still 56 years old and doing his own stunts is remarkable - the HALO jump over Paris had me breathless. McQuarrie recognizes what worked in ROGUE NATION and what didn't, and he makes sure to not end the film on an anti-climactic note. This might be the first MISSION: IMPOSSIBLE to actually peak at the end, rather than somewhere in the middle (the Langley heist, the Burj Khalifa sequence, the Morocco chase, etc.) Granted, the film shifts a bit more into the Bond and Bourne territory, with the spy hijinks (masks and crazy gadgets) taking a bit of a back seat, but this only leads to McQuarrie more effectively keeping us on our toes (the unveiling of a certain masked figure halfway through proved quite the surprise).Furthermore, everyone here gets a chance to shine, with Henry Cavill's Walker fitting right right in as the CIA agent tasked with keeping tabs on Ethan Hunt and Co. Rebecca Ferguson returns as well and for the better - Ilsa Faust remains the most dynamic female character in the series and it's not even close. Even Simon Pegg, who has mostly been relegated to providing tech support, gets his chance to put his fighting skills to the test in one of the film's many exhilarating action sequences. Sean Harris' Solomon Lane, the primary antagonist in ROGUE NATION, once again returns, and while I still think his plans are much more menacing than himself, Harris makes the most of his expanded role. It was a joy to see Michelle Monaghan back as Hunt's wife Julia as well, even if her screentime was less than I'd hoped it'd be. But as expected, the real star of the show here is Tom Cruise, who manages to ground the film with a clear moral compass. Cruise is clearly one of the best components of this series, pulling double-duty not only as an action star/stuntman, but as a dramatic actor (see: MISSION: IMPOSSIBLE III's opening sequence). A lot of praise goes towards Cruise's stunts and rightly so, but this franchise needs wouldn't be the same without his acting chops.Additionally, not only did McQuarrie write and direct the most action-packed and tightly-plotted installment in this franchise thus far, he also assembled a stellar technical crew. Cinematographer Rob Hardy, whose work on Alex Garland's EX MACHINA and ANNIHILATION was one of best aspects of either film, truly makes FALLOUT a joy to watch, with crisp and texturally rich 35mm imagery that made me want to reach out and touch the screen. This is a stunning film, and the best-looking installment in the franchise by far (no small feat considering Oscar winner Robert Elswit shot both GHOST PROTOCOL and ROGUE NATION). Yes, Lorne Balfe score sounds a bit too much like Hans Zimmer's work on THE DARK KNIGHT trilogy, but that doesn't change the fact that it perfectly complements the film. In fact, I'm listening to it right now as I write this review. Editor Eddie Hamilton deserves praise as well - his clean and precise cutting infusing every chase and fistfight with a burst of adrenaline. Hamilton clearly understands the difficulty of the stunts required to make the action work and allows the audience to view them in all their glory.MISSION: IMPOSSIBLE - FALLOUT is a astonishing picture that ranks not as the best in the franchise, but as one of the best action films ever. McQuarrie, Cruise, and the rest of the cast and crew poured their hearts and souls into this and it shows. This is heart-stopping, jaw-dropping entertainment. I can't wait it to see it again.",

The revival of Mission: Impossible for TV in 1988 was also generally fun and imaginative, but some of these Tom Cruise movies, man, they blow those old shows away, often figuratively, sometimes literally with nods to special effects or technology of the past.The IMF needs people to wear many hats, although Ving Rhames only has one hat to wear. The team needs a technology expert who also knows demolition skills. The team needs a master of disguise who no longer needs actings skills because a scanner, laptop, 3D printer, and a voice modulator do all the hard work now. You need a lead spy to coordinate the plans, even if there are none, providing moral support and a tacit rallying cry when the mission seems doomed to fail, is failing, or seems downright impossible.Then again, the IMF would be terrible spies in reality, just as James Bond would be a terrible spy in reality, because anyone who's anyone in the global threat theater knows each other and if they somehow do not, they all meet at some fancy party dance gala pushing intrigue to teeter on the precipice of its own ennui.Some have told me Henry Cavill is a good-looking man. I say he is a bad actor, who not only does not need to cock his fists before each fist-fight, but could easily be removed from this sixth installment altogether, without sacrificing too much excitement or too much twisting of plots.Also, nice to see Wes Bentley getting work again, this time without an infatuation for plastic bags blowing in the wind.

That's like Wayne's World, meant to be laughed at. And the action scenes and stunts --- I'm letting out a whistle between my teeth. I thought \"Wow, that's incredible stunt doubling, and camera angling\". Well, you know what? Cruise does his own stunts.

The first three were what I would consider \"solid\" or \"good\" films, but nothing memorable. The most recent three, however, rise to the level of being very good action movies, with Mission Impossible: Fallout being the best of these three.The movie starts as a continuation of the last film, Mission Impossible: Rogue Nation, with the cult-like adherents of Solomon Lane, the antagonist of the last film, waging an espionage war against formal governments. To make matters worse, U.S. intelligence have learned that these adherents are trying to step up their game by securing plutonium (for what purpose, we find out later in the film). Enter Ethan Hunt and the IMF. They're hired by said U.S. intelligence agencies to intercept a deal involving the Syndicate (i.e., the name of the group formerly run by the now-imprisoned Solomon Lane) and an arms dealer selling weapons-grade plutonium, posing as the Syndicate in order to fulfill the transaction. However, the deal in interrupted (by whom, we don't find out until later), and the plutonium is stolen in the process owing to a decision by Ethan Hunt to save one of his personnel rather than watch over the plutonium. Interestingly, Ethan Hunt and his associates aren't harmed in the botched transaction (without revealing anything, we find out why much later in the film).What starts as a process to obtain the stolen plutonium leads to various intricacies and plot twists, the likes of which top any Mission Impossible movie heretofore released. The action sequences are also quite breathtaking (especially the bathroom fight scene). Keep in mind, however, that the movie's also fairly intelligent, and the plot twists actually form a coherent whole by the end of the movie.Good work, Mr. Cruise.",

But, since it made lots of cash and his Scientologist friends will profit from it, I doubt he is sorry in any way shape or form.I wanted to walk out after the first 15 minutes (I was generous), but I thought maybe there would be a twist. I waited it out until the bitter end and what a waste of my time it was.The script was a zero on a one to ten scale. I couldn't believe the stupidity of the IMF in the first 15 minutes of the film. (Damn, it's the IMF! \"Stupid\" is not their middle name in any other film of the franchise.) Okay, maybe Nathan Hunt has become a victim of PSTD and is generally dysfunctional after the events of the previous and better films. But I waited for that excuse and it never came.I thought at first it was a big IMF scam a tradition dictates. It wasn't. They really lost the ball in the first reel and it was their very stupid fault (not to mention that they never really got it back)! The IMF doesn't DO that in such a simple situation! I kept waiting for Nathan to wake up from ANOTHER nightmare for the rest of the film. He and his team were incompetent and insensitive (since the bad guys were obvious), but even though I thought they knew that and were playing the great, traditional IMF long game, I was wrong! They were dumb. There were only mediocre chase scenes with completely disoriented paths through Paris (I know Paris and those scenes could not geographically been sequential... excuse me... let me translate for the American millennials : That route would make no sense for an intelligent, so-called \"international agent\", let alone an intelligent IMF agent) and would have taken over 1 hour and a half even at those speeds. It went in circles and covered over 20 miles, i.e.,nowhere fast, but illogically and very badly.Yes, there were some interesting action scenes like crashes and such (thanks to the second team director). But there have been 10 times better action scenes in films that don't have a \"canon\" to follow. The first \"Taken\", for example, or the first \"Transporter\". There were also a few (very few) respectable performances despite the crap script. I suspect the actors were pressed into following the script word for word by the loser of a director (and the loser of a producer, Cruise).I liked the rest of the MI franchise, but this film made me hope it was the last. The approval of this film is just another example of how so very many critical standards in the US have degenerated.",

More than that is the fact of introducing even more risky stunts into the frame each time Ethan Hunt decides to surprise the audience with a new chapter of his adventures.The sixth film does not disappoint with the part of practical effects: the legends about preparing the shots are still spreading around but the truth is that the crew simply takes their butts on the line to provide a viewer with a quality of tricks almost as you are doing them yourself. The fights are like those compositions of Bach except in this case your eyes are enjoying the show instead of ears.For sure there were many plot holes that made me cover my eyes and force to forget them in the sake of great action. The behavior of characters and the repeated nagging motive of distrust keeps bothering but apparently nothing is perfect.Tom Cruise shows an incredible dedication to the role and despite the trauma proves that age is nothing when Ethan Hunt is in your blood. Henry Cavill after the \"incident with a moustache\" had to demonstrate that the sacrifice was not in vain. Frankly, it wasn't. Of course I don't see why the look was required but he really nailed role of the \"hammer\".I'm sure that many people will agree that there is no Ethan Hunt without Tom Cruise and considering the success of the last movie I hope that the seventh film will be getting to us soon. Let's just hope that Tom Cruise stays safe as he does his breathtaking stunts.",

All the other actors in this movie were excellent as well! You really got the impression that the actors were a \"team\" when it came to making this movie. Lots of excitement.. a ton of action.. a nail-biter at times.. plus the occasional interjection of humor. The Mission: Impossible franchise is like a younger, more hip version of the James Bond \"empire\". Plus at 2 hrs and 30 minutes, you really get your money's worth. At no point does the movie drag.. but just keeps you going the whole time. By the way, chase scenes and action.. along with cinematography were awesome!

One male shooter working for the bad guys calls Eathan by his name and this is glossed over later on. The bad guys get the suitcase of plutonium casings from IMF team.Bathroom fight scene prevails. After Ilsa a spy for the MI6, having to kill middleman John Lark in self defense to protect Eathan, the team goes to meet the White Widow. She is an attractive bomb broker and is found in record time. Eathan decides to pose as Lark depite misgivings of team, thinking broker is ignorant of what Lark looks like and not aware of previous botched plutonium exchange Eathan was a part of.White Widow holds the keys to exchanging the plutonium for money but she must have a client that never gives any key info on the fact that IMF and Eathan Hunt were just hours ago the ones posing as a radical group. The ones the bad guys stole the plutonium casings from. I think this a major plot hole. Since you would want to make sure you are not caught, and are selling the most dangerous of product. You would have told broker, oh yeah don't sell to this guy Eathan Hunt he is a spy. Audience, try to grit teeth and suspend disbelief.The movie follows with standard fallen agent, played by Henry Cavill. Apparently honest agents are Impossible to find as witnessed throughout the franchise. You never really develop any emotions toward our main bad guy Lane since he is just another chess piece dropped in between action scenes. Cavill although more feelings may be adopted, only briefly since the movie gives zero time for audience to really know him one way or another. The action scenes must go on as they say.Near the end of movie there is a helicopter action scene where Ethan jumps into a helicopter. One of the members announces over the com, \"hey I didn't know you could fly helicopters\". Yes, Ethan Hunt can't fly a helicopter, never flew one, and should not be able to make complex manuevers that only an experience pilot could make, but the audience knows Tom Cruise can. So no worries there, but suspend disbelief and grit teeth and try not to laugh cause I think this is an inside joke.You have to judge this movie (and most MI movies) mostly by action scenes because as an acting piece its just average. I did enjoy the movie but it was about 20 minutes too long. I just wanted it to end. The predictable ending and IMF saving the world are standard fare for the franchise. Final note: I do wish the MI script could follow more of the 70's franchise. Whereby, the team causes the bad guys to politically self-implode. Aka bad guys kill each other. Oh well, can only wish.",

Most wondered if if it was getting a bit too much. But the series has picked itself well, especially in the last 2 movies and the recently released Mission: Impossible- Fallout, only takes it up a notch.The movie is very high on adrenaline. I was very relieved that it was in the 2D format, as one doesn't need the dependence of 3D if they have stunning visuals. The plot pretty much continues from where it ended in the previous Mission: Impossible. There is action in the movie from the word go and it lives up to all the hype around the promotions about the real stunts performed. Director Christopher McQuarrie really seem to have find a knack of working with Tom Cruise. This film has one of the best camerawork that I have seen in recent days and the choice of locations and settings compliment it really well. However the humour element as compared to the last 2 movies is slightly less on this one.The movie is a lot about Ethan Hunt and his character and Tom Cruise, not only cakewalks, but runs, jumps and limps through his role. He can be a role model for many aspiring action stars out there. Henry Cavill looks menacing as Agent Walker although his character doesn't have much emotions to portray. Sean Harris once again has a very impacting negative character in the limited screen time he has. Simon Pegg and Ving Rhames do good Robins to Tom Cruise's Batman. All other supporting characters do a decent job.Mission: Impossible - Fallout is a very good example of a crisp film making for all the action films. Do not miss this end of summer blockbuster.",

Most of the other parts have the climactic action set piece half way through the film (the Langley scene, Burj Khalifa, the Opera or underwater heist) but not this time, the ending was crazy and I held my breath until the last second.\nThe director outdone himself this time and outdid his masterful work in \"Rogue Nation:.\nThe acting is amazing, especially considering that Tom Cruise had to act while performing all these INSANE stunts! Henry Cavill kept the moustache for a very understandable reason and it totally paid off, the best was made on the right horse. The rest of the cast: CHAPEAU!\nEvery character was very well utilized in the story, based on their capabilities and were tested accordingly. Even the fighting styles, you can see clearly the fighting style and signature moves of each character utilized in each fight, which made for very smart call backs to previous scenes and fights from previous parts. \nMy only problem maybe is that I wished seeing Jeremy Rener's character as it would have been a great addition to the team.\nAll in all, I am afraid if they aim to make another part. For me this should have been/be the proper send off for these characters and the appropriate goodbye for Ethan Hunt.

He might be fit and running a lot, also doing some less dangerous scenes, but he's probably doing none of them.\nThe level on hypocrisy with this guy is immense. He sends body doubles to press appointments. Did you know that? Some mentioned him flying the helicopter or taking lessons. That might be true, but the scenes are all shot in front of a green screen (idiots).I liked Superman as the bad guy.. although I could spot that one from a mile away.

Right then and there I decided to catch it and thanks to my friend who was late, my 2D ticket was upgraded to IMax and I tell you it was worth the running we had to do in order to make it to the last screening. We've just barely gotten our bearings back after getting to our seat and the first action sequence which takes place in a restroom is Golden (or Lit, depending on which part of the generation spectrum you fall under.) I bet that arm gun reload improvised by Henry Cavill has impregnated people who've seen it (notice the usage of 'people' instead of 'women'.)Speaking of Henry, seeing him on IMax is what the world needs right now to make all of our problems go away. He is huge (Alec Baldwin had to ask him to adjust his shoulders so the camera can see his face lol), and it's hard not to notice him. I can see him taking over the franchise but the movie has something else planned for him. Another sight to behold is Vanessa Kirby as the White Widow. Enchanting is the best word to describe her and hopefully she'll show up again if they're going to work on another MI movie. Missing from the party is Jeremy Renner who was tied up with the Avengers 4 movie and I kinda can't stop feeling bad for the guy. The Bourne franchise went back to Matt Damon, then he misses out on Infinity War, then he's not here as well when all the while I was under the impression he was being groomed to take over Tom Cruise. But I guess with the latter experiencing somewhat of a resurgence in his career (just don't mention The Mummy reboot), he'll try to stick around for as long as he can. And why wouldn't he? It's been a very successful franchise save for the hiccup that was MI2, and he's still very much capable of doing his own stunts at 56 yrs old. In this day and age when it's easy to green screen the hard stuff, we have to give credit where it's due. That jump barely making it to the next building injured his ankle and delayed production for 7 weeks. He also had to train for a year in order to do the skydiving stunt. Even Henry mentioned the disparity between his stunts as Superman compared to here where he really had to get his hands dirty.All things considered, the plot is just okay and some scenes are even predictable for someone who's into the spy stuff but the action scenes are jam-packed and will have you on the edge of your seat. No word yet if there'll be a 7th installment although from how things are going they'd be foolish not to make another one. After Infinity War, this is the second best action movie to come out this year and if I haven't mentioned it enough, you have to see the action sequences and Henry Cavill in IMax. I can say it was worth the dough even if I wasn't the one that coughed up the money.",

I've watched half of the MI movies (don't have the nerve to watch them all) and Fallout is quite typical. The plot was obvious with no surprises, screenplay short and half of the time I was able to guess the dialog. Of course as any MI movie it comes with pretty much impossible acrobatics and very bad science (bad is actually an understatement). I do understand this is a blockbuster and we cannot expect much but I've seen a lot better ones with far lower score. I have to ask those who praise the movie - are you out of your minds?",

Yeah, I'm gushing, and love him or hate him, but my goodness this movie/franchise is his. The plot is fairly easy to follow, but you probably have to be a die-hard fan to recognize some of the peripheral players and plot lines. The movie scoots along nicely and doesn't lose focus.

It is the sixth installment in the Mission: Impossible film series, and the second film to be directed by McQuarrie following the 2015 film Rogue Nation, making him the first director to direct more than one film in the franchise. The cast includes Tom Cruise, Ving Rhames, Simon Pegg, Rebecca Ferguson, Sean Harris, Michelle Monaghan, and Alec Baldwin, all of whom reprise their roles from the previous films. Henry Cavill, Vanessa Kirby, and Angela Bassett join the franchise. In the film, Ethan Hunt and his team must track down missing plutonium while being monitored by the Apostles after a mission goes wrong.Talks for a sixth Mission: Impossible film began before releasing Rogue Nation in 2015. The film was officially announced in November 2015, with McQuarrie confirming his return as writer and director, as well as producer alongside J. J. Abrams and Cruise, the seventh collaboration between the pair. Jeremy Renner confirmed that he was unable to appear in the film because of scheduling conflicts with Avengers: Endgame. Filming took place from April 2017 to March 2018 in Paris, London, New Zealand, Norway, and the United Arab Emirates. Production was notably put on hold for two months following an injury to Cruise in August 2017.Mission: Impossible - Fallout had its world premiere in Paris on July 12, 2018, and was released in the United States on July 27, 2018; it was the first in the series to be released in RealD 3D, and also had an IMAX release. It grossed $791 million worldwide, making it the highest-grossing film of Cruise's career, the eighth highest grossing film of 2018, and the highest-grossing film in the franchise, surpassing Ghost Protocol. It received critical acclaim for its direction, screenplay, cinematography, action sequences, stunts, musical score, and acting and is considered by many critics to be the best installment in the franchise.Two sequels, Mission: Impossible 7 and Mission: Impossible.",

The movies plot is terrific and all the actors play their roles exceedingly well. The only negative comment is that the movie takes too many ideas from the 007 / Bond films and implements them into this film. For example, the villain in this film sounds like Mr. White in previous Bond films. The winter looking Hunt looks very much dressed like Bond did in Spectre. The use of the helicopter crash seen looks like that of the airplane scene from, again, Spectre. Great movie as a whole but as a fan of both franchises I found too much content from Bond injected into MI.",

I'm also not the biggest fan of Tom Cruise but he gets a round of applause from me for this one. Its been a while since a Mission Impossible movie impressed me so much. The actors all did a perfectly fine job, better than some previous films and the action was just awesome as heck. I don't want to give away too much but this film was definitely worth the price of admission. Better storytelling and action that a great number of action films we see in today's Hollywood machine, a machine that often produces pretty bad movies.

As always the stunt work is fantastic and the choreography of all action scenes is incredible, adding to that McQuarrie has stepped up his game since his last outing as MI director using more tracking and panning shots so that action sequences are easier to follow and the stakes feel more real as well as utilising drone footage to create a more vertigo enduing sequence than when Ethan Hunt climbed with worlds tallest building in Ghost Protocol. The dedication to this stunt work shown by Cruise, Pegg, Fergison and series newcomer Cavill elevates these scenes even further allowing the stakes to be felt by the audience in a more intimate and terrifying way than in most other action franchises.The screenplay makes twists and turns appear as easy and natural as Cruise does with stunt work. It picks up story threads from previous instalments as well as developing new characters in genuinely interesting and engaging ways.My one flaw is almost uniform for this series however between the awe-inspiring stunt work and character development the actual \"mission\" can sometimes be an after thought making it either hard to follow or far to simplistic to still be engaging.With this film's excellent character moments and twist however this issue barely annoyed me if at all during my screening and the balance of these elements is the best and most fluid they have ever been.If you are a fan of these films or a fan of action cinema at all I am telling you that you need to see this movie!Rocky had its first dud with movie 3, star wars' was movie 4 and so was Indiana Jones.

            "review_title": "Mission Impossible: Fallout",
            "content": "'Mission Impossible: Fallout' is directed by Christopher McQuarrie, who previously directed 'Rogue Nation,' and is the first instalment of the franchise in which a director has returned. 'Fallout' has proved this excellent decision. McQuarrie has taken everything that has worked within the series, as he did in 'Rogue Nation,' and escalated them through stunning tension. The action set pieces the series has become known for are combined with refined emotional stakes in 'Fallout.' McQuarrie is clearly aware that intense action is not intense without the audience being emotionally invested in the characters.The stakes in 'Fallout' are ridiculously high involving a nuclear threat, which we as audience members have become accustomed to due to constant 'end of the world' scenarios we are faced with in most blockbusters today, yet McQuarrie keeps the story rooted within character, bringing the film above other generic action films with these plot points. Sean Harris's brilliantly menacing 'Solomon Lane' makes the threat personal to Tom Cruise's 'Ethan Hunt.' This personal element is escalated with the return of Michelle Monaghan reprising her role from J.J. Abrams's 'Mission Impossible: 3' who is at the heart of the story from the very opening shot. McQuarrie has created the most emotionally intense film of the series by developing its characters before placing them within the action. Rebecca Ferguson, returning as 'Isla Faust' from 'Rogue Nation' is given a rivetingly unpredictable role. Simon Pegg and Ving Rhames also reprise their roles. Although underused, Rhames has a surprisingly emotional dialogue scene, increasing the tension in proceeding action scenes involving his character. The film is set up unpredictably in a way which means you actually feel the characters are at real risk, and of course, Tom Cruise gives a fittingly vulnerable, strong performance as Ethan Hunt especially in scenes involving Monaghan's character and in interactions with Sean Harris as 'Lane.'The jaw-dropping action sequences are made jaw-dropping due to their practicality. Cruise has shockingly topped the C-17 stunt in 'Rogue Nation' with a terrifyingly brilliant helicopter sequence filmed using IMAX cameras, performed for real in typical Tom Cruise fashion. The Paris motorcycle sequence is so intense it is difficult to watch, yet you won't be able to take your eyes of the screen. What makes these action scenes is that the stunts are combined with perfect camerawork whereby McQuarrie isn't attempting to imitate the shakiness of 'Bourne' as J.J. Abrams tried unsuccessfully in 'Mission Impossible: 3.' He is doing the opposite. The camera is placed within the action and showcases the stunts in all their glory, following objects/characters or even being attached to them, a style recently brought back with a few films such as 'John Wick.' There is a stand-out action sequence in a bathroom which is far more grounded than larger scaled stunts within the film, yet it is made just as intense, maybe more so, through stunning choreography and the casting of 'Liang Yang' whose menacing facial expressions alone elevate the intensity of the sequence. Unusual for hand-to-hand combat film sequences, you feel the impactof every punch. This feeling of impact is obviously brought out through the choreography, but is also heightened with sound design. Every punch is bone crunching and brutally heard. Every gunshot is joltingly loud. In contrast, McQuarrie has also used silence in moments of action, most notably as a result of a lightning strike during the nail-biting H.A.L.O jump sequence, and in a brilliant one-take shootout sequence in order to give it the surreal feeling it required.Furthermore, there are quieter scenes of tension throughout created by performances and writing. The writing is often predictable, and is no 'Usual Suspects,' also written by Christopher McQuarrie, yet it is often very good in terms of creating tension. A scene which stood out for me was one involving a French policewoman for its tension. Humour is also cleverly balanced with tension and darkness, especially evident in this scene - a scene of initial humour which unfolds into extreme tension and weightiness.In conclusion, 'Fallout' is the best entry in the series yet with its culmination of incredible stunt work, performances and a personal story to the characters which serves to heighten the intensity.",

I understand he is one of world's biggest stars; but at some point he's got to stop trying to look like a boy. In his last films, several of them, he looks odd. esp. next to stud Cavill. You got Pegg and Rhames who do fine. He needs to sync up with them. But who can argue with millions and millions of dollars in gross revenue? They did great. Incredible! action sequences. If Cavill, and some of other actors had stunt doubles, I could not tell. We all know Tom does his own work. Good film. And I have to see more shows with V Kirby",

So Tom cruise is back as Ethan hunt and is still running away from explosions. The thing I like about this franchise is that it gets bigger in size with every movie , the story might be cliched in all of em but the size and grandness never fails to surprise me. The plot in this movie is very linear and doesn't drag anywhere . I also liked how this was the only movie in the franchise where the story retains characters and plot pieces from the previous movie. Simon pegg wasn't as funny as he was in the other movies but I guess his character has evolved. Henry Cavill as walker is just a monster , This guy should've played batman instead of superman. Now the action in this movie is just insanely good. There was absolutely no CGI and most of the fight choreography as well as the stunts were just mind-blowing and will keep you at the edge of your seat. In the end , fallout is the best in the series with edge of the seat action , great characters , Tom cruise jumping off buildings and one classic theme song remixed for every movie.",

There are many plot twists but there isn't anything clever about any of them. About half way through this movie I had had all I could take. It seemed like I had been watching it for at least a couple hours, but then it went on for what seemed like another couple of hours after that. Eventually I stopped caring and was just wanting for it to end. This is at least the 5th time I've tried to watch this movie on cable. Each of the last four attempts I have started out determined to stay focused on it from start to finish. I always give up about half way through. They should have retired the stupid masks immediately after the first of the revived series, the one with Jon Voight. The masks had become much too tedious even in that movie, and yet the producers, most likely Cruise, kept bringing the back and using them again and again. I just saw that they are actually going to make another one, due out sometime next year, in 2023. If people keep returning to the theater and paying money to see them, they'll keep making them. I'd rather watch reruns of the old TV show. It was more clever by leaps and bounds than any of these movies have been.",

The ending wasn't just fantastical, it was painfully against physics, which is something that normally is adhered to with MI movies. I mean, the hook flies through the air and snags a rock to stop the helicopter? Also, before that, it was some stroke of brilliance apparently to figure out how to take the other helicopter down except it really wasn't. It was obvious, just like most of the movie. Some scenes had that flare of originality and adrenaline but definitely not the ending, which was rather lackluster given all of the predecessors.Also, they couldn't come up with a new villian so they used an old one, but didn't really make him seem as impressive as before.And the cherry on top was the knowledge that they wouldn't allow Henry Caville to wear a fake mustache so that the other Superman movie producer didnt' have to spend 20 million dollars to CGI it out! That's just poor class on top of a mediocre movie.They had better raise the bar back to their usual standards of craftiness and originality because if I just wanted to see a big budget action film, I could watch Fast and Furious or any other number of counterparts out there. But MI has always had something most other ones didn't - and frankly it wasn't in Fallout.\nCheers!",

But it also means our expectations are higher. So 'Fallout' is not a bad movie although, of the six MI films, it's the least good. Also, I'm the same age as Tom Cruise so it truly pains me to say this... Tom is starting to look his age. At 56, 41 in Hollywood leading men years, his face has less integrity, the hair color is off by years and he looks great but you can tell he's trying. It might be time for 'Agent Hunt' to come in from the field. Just sayin'. Otherwise, Rebecca Ferguson, who is 35 (of course she is), brought a fresh look and much needed fiest to 'Rogue'. More subdued in this film but still wonderful to watch. Frankly, It'd be nice to see her in charge of the IMF team. Am I right, ladies! 'Fallout' is more fuzzy familial and less cold hearted. A six seems harsh but I'm comparing it to the other five movies in the franchise. In my opinion the first MI (1996) is still the best. 'Rogue Nation' (2015) second. 'Ghost Protocol' (2011) third. MI 2 (2000) and MI 3 (2006) tied for fourth and 'Fallout'. Still I look forward to the seventh - Mission Impossible: Reverse Mortgage Scam.",

Keep the dialogue smart and funny while keeping it simple for the globalised market where jokes don't work and dialogue can be easily dubbed and understood.Impossible?It's hard for me to fathom the goodwill the Cruiser generates for each new IMF struggle. The films are formulaic and cliche and reuse the same out-of-the-box visual effects as each other instalment after the doves one, to the point I can't tell them apart. Is this the free climbing one? Or the one in London? Or with Simon Pegg? Have I seen this? Or when he rides a motorcycle? Or crashed a car.Cruise dominates each and every part of the film with the same sufferance expression that indicates he may need a hug. As for the women; kick ass heroines they may be (although one's a global network Florence Nightingale instead) but that doesn't mean the don't all go a quiver as soon as the script allows them to share the screen with the Hunt. More shorthand means brunette's a saint while blonde is evil. In fact in one particularly torturous scene Cruise delivers all Rebecca Ferguson's lines himself as she tilts her head at various angles like she's using ESP or like when people personify their dogs, an indictment of what happens when a woman agrees to share a scene with an actor/ star/ producer so intent on self promoting he forgets \"generosity\"In fact everyone is so in love with the Hunt that even the copter clouds form love hearts and the only person not to is obviously just evil.Yes it's entertaining and takes itself incredibly seriously but if it has an iota of originality it might be memorable. The only scene that sticks is the Hunt announcing his intention to jump out a window, and while each onlooker looks suitably shocked and horrified at a suicidal man broadcasting his intention; confusingly one office worker nods her silent appreciation.",

Writers Christoper Mcquarrie and Bruce Geller definitely bring an exciting and refreshing take on this movie with stunts that keep getting better and better which were all performed by Tom Cruise himself, which leaves us thinking ...Was there anything that this man could not do? The action sequences were all very realistic, terrifying and just jaw-droppingly awesome that made me gasp in awe.Tom Cruise who reprises his role as the legendary Ethan Hunt along with Simon Pegg (Benji), Ving Rhames (Luthor) whose characters have matured and they've done a fantastic job playing them. Rebecca Furguson (Ilsa) returns from Rogue nation and has improved quite a bit and portrayed her character impeccably. Sean Harris, Angela Bassett, Alec Baldwin and Michelle Monaghan all return and do a great job portraying their characters as well. The chemistry between Pegg, Cruise, and Rhames works well as always. Even the jokes were not over the top but fit in perfectly with the scene and the storyline. Henry Cavill is the new addition to the cast and shines in his role portraying August Walker. At least this character had some depth and wasn't one dimensional. The locations where they shot the movie was just breathtaking and mesmerizing.This movie had incredible visuals, an interesting storyline though some revelations were a bit foreseeable, MI6 definitely stands out in this franchise and does outshine Ghost Protocol ( one of my favorite movies in the franchise). I absolutely enjoyed this movie and I was riveted to the screen from beginning till the end with all the fast-paced entertaining scenes. This is definitely a thrilling action summer blockbuster film surpassing Skyscraper though, in my opinion, I feel you can't compare these movies as they are on different levels.",

But dialogue comes second to the building intensity of fists, knives, guns, motorbikes, helicopters, tall buildings and cliff faces. Yes there is actually action in this movie that is done in ways we haven't seen and a motorcycle chase second to none. Regardless of your personal feelings towards Tom Cruise, he is certainly a master of his craft and the 'Mission' movies certainly bring out his best. Supported by a great ensemble of Simon Pegg, Ving Rhymes, Alec Baldwin and, try not to drool girls, Henry Cavill. If you're looking for an action treat, this is the most thrilling ride in the park, worth every penny you pay and you will come out of the cinema humming the theme.",

            "content": "Ladies and Gentlemen, this is not a documentary of real CIA missions, this is not Mission: Somewhat Difficult. This is Mission IMPOSSIBLE. I cannot believe people would give something like this a poor rating due to a lack of realism. The greatest strength of this movie, which is something all the MI movies have done, is they really give a sense of the ridiculousness and epicness of the stunts performed in the movie. No one goes into an action movie expecting the characters to fail, but this movie uses superb visuals and soundtrack to show (not tell) the audience how the characters must pull off ridiculous feats. I didn't really believe Hunt or his team were going to die, or that the bomb was going to go off, etc, but through shots like Halo jumping into a lightning storm, riding a motorcycle into oncoming traffic (one of the most well done chase scenes I have ever seen), or the mountain helicopter scene, I was left in awe and on the edge of my seat to see the resolution.\nOf course, this film had its limitations. The plot was better than most movies in the genre, although there were some poorly explained parts and they probably went a little overboard with the double crossing. Character development is limited outside of Ethan. The villain was poorly fleshed out, although it was refreshing to see an idealistic villain who wasn't standing on his soapbox and yelling at the audience for half the film. The acting was great, but I didn't really care for Cavill in this role.\nRegardless, this is a must see film. If you cannot enjoy the visual and audio spectacle that is Mission Impossible-Fallout, you probably need to relax and take your movies a little less seriously. Plenty of movies have ridiculous, over the top stunts, but this movie is the first in a long time that made those stunts look fluid, unpredictable and even believable, even if we know they are absurd.",

For 22 years we have seen Tom Cruise at his finest, but with this new installment in the franchise, like I said, things aren't what they seem. \n The franchise has seen its directors from Brian de Palma to John Woo to J.J. Abrams to Brad Bird and the last Christopher McQuarrie. Props goes to Chris for making this movie and Rogue Nation being the most dangerous missions that Ethan Hunt has ever faced. \n I would definitely recommend this movie to any high speed, jump out of your seat adrenaline junkie.

I also want to add that the actors in this movie were phenomenal. The plot was simply great, my heart was pounding throughout the entire movie. I would have to say my favorite thing about Mission: Impossible - Fallout was that even though it was a fast-paced, action film, there were parts in the movie that were funny and that's how I know it is a really good movie- that there can be a good balance of comedy, drama, and action.

Finally you have to catch that story just by the fast conversation between characters and almost nothing is to be seen in the plot of the movie itself. \nActing also can be rated with low mark, since you don't need such thing for running and fighting. Maybe 3 -4 stars for that, nothing more . Although I like Tom Cruise in the movie, he still has his charisma. Don't doubt on that. I like that character Ethan Hunt, no changes on that course. It is naturally that he is getting older. \nThings that are worth high marks are excellent stenography (we are flowing movie plot in London, Paris, and Kashmir), and film makers used it very much to hide that empty story. That worth 10 stars for sure.\nFinally, if you going to see this movie for its action (non stop), you are going to be very amazed and satisfied! That is what you expected from this movie, didn't you? That definitely worth no less than 10 stars. \nSo that is how I've got 7 stars for this movie. Nevertheless I do think that some old movies from this franchise were much better for sure.",

It really feels like we are living in a solid era for action franchises with the Raid, John Wick, MI and even the Fast and Furious for our b-movie action goodness. We live in exploding times!Honestly, I don't think I have seen an action movie/spy game thriller that was this much fun in a while. Everything they did in this film was top notch. From the stunts to the chase sequence, to the amazing Helicopter chase...I mean damn. Also, if Cavill not being Superman anymore means we can see him as the beast he was in this movie, with an equally as beast mode a mustache, then I am all good with that. There are a few nitpicks, I thought that the movie dragged a bit between the middle and the end, I also had a few moments when I wasn't exactly convinced with Cruises acting, but nothing that really took me out of the film. Also while there was a spy story as always with this franchise, it still relies on the stunts and action to do the heavy lifting. Which isn't bad, when the action you have is this good.MI: Fallout is very good. One of the better action films of the last while.

And the humor is quality, especially since Simon Pegg was added in. The three primary actresses in this film are high caliber and beautiful. And, yet ... while the story arc was good, the emotional elements seemed forced. The character development and use was inconsistent. Ving Rhames' character has become a canned, predictably mundane bit player. I like Ving Rhames and his tough guy persona in combo with his computer skills was an excellent early feature to the films, but the fact is, his character has become a caricature over time - a canned, non-factor that is often more liability than strength. This film seemed more of an Ethan Hunt / Tom Cruise hero worship homage than it did a team oriented, mission impossible. I don't want to trash the film because there were elements I liked. But, 8.4??? More like a 7.",

Flag those lights, dammit!There's a lot of good action in this film. Cruise delivers the intensity. Cavill is a brute. Pegg the comic relief. Rhames the heart. You'll have fun.

Some of the comments just stunned me \"best action movie of the last century\", \"flawless\", \"the best movie I have seen in years\".\nI'm just glad I didn't read these and base my decision to watch the movie on them - I'd have been bitterly disappointed .\nI can only believe what other reviewers say; that these inflated scores are from paid reviewers. Which is lame. \nThe movie was Tom Cruise hero-heavy for me, I would rather have seen other characters have some hero time - where's Jeremy Renner? I loved him in the previous movie. This was the Tom Cruise show, and really over the top in that regard, that insane miles long run over the roofs of buildings was actually funny by the end.\nI liked the bathroom fight scene which was visceral and entertaining. The vehicle chases were good too. The helicopter chase was over long and beyond unrealistic. The attempt to defuse apparently undefusable bombs, with the nurse ex wife helping was stupid, the use of previous characters again was lazy - although I like Rebecca Ferguson's character. Henry Cavill was underused and Angela Bassett pointless. \nA very mixed bag for me with long sections where I was quite bored and underwhelmed.

I am not even going to explain over the top plot holes like why certain character was doing what for which reason because this is a movie, not a novel study but this installment was not engaging at all, the tricks were same old and story so predictable. Isla Faust's role is hardly justified although her performance is really good while doing action scenes. Photography is good, not so a great piece of art but you must see this movie in 3D to really enjoy the stunts and scenes. The literally non-existent challenger to Tom's spy prowess was biggest disappointment for me. I would watch it again for Tom's stunts and may be for Benji's humour but nothing else.",

Three years later, the same Tom Cruise did a HALO jump from an altitude of 25,000 feet. Now I'm thinking, HOW IS ANY MOVIE GOING TO MATCH THIS STUNT?! \nI mean you can't just do things like this at the age of 56. Mission Impossible Fallout is the best mission movie yet. It's the coordination of the stunts that amazed me the most. The opening scene and the events until the first stunt scene gave an excellent boost for the film. The story takes off rapidly and keeps jumping from one action scene to the next. \nEvery bit of action gives you a sense of enthusiasm. You can actually feel it's environment. The cinematography and editing stand out. And this time, the music really heightens the thrill. Tom Cruise's Ethan Hunt is finally fully unleashed. Every mission movie is about Ethan doing the extreme but this time it's more like exploring what's beyond the extreme. The way Tom handles every scene is a spectacle. Putting your body on the line to give the audience the best cinematic experience, how many actors do that these days? \nHenry Cavill without the cape is a perfect fit for the film. \nAlso, it was good to have Rebecca Fergusson back with the classic mission cast. Vanessa Kirby impresses as the \"White Widow\". Helicopter sequence, Paris motorcycle chase, London rooftop chase, HALO jump, bathroom fight, I love everything about Fallout.

            "content": "I tend not to write reviews here for films that kind of don't need them, for example if a film is something I feel is under or over rated, I'll review, or if something just really completely irks me I'll review. I rarely if ever review something that is really good, and critically well received. So why am I reviewing MI6? Because it was just that good, and I can't think of a single visual franchise with the, whether it be books, or games that tops itself in it's 6th iteration. Fair enough, you could argue, the MI films are about spectacle rather than character, so much like James Bond, it's not hard to repeat and improve. I would argue however, that especially in today's wealth of excellent media available to us, that such a feat really isn't that straightforward, and that MI6 is somewhat of a marvel. And it's star is someone who is not without controversy. Maybe not the damning controversy of many others in the industry, but I know people who just can't ignore the fact he is a scientologist. Frankly I've never cared, because he's such a good actor, unlike others, you never see him give anything less than 120%, and that's personally all I need to know. And in this film he literally brakes bones and bleeds for the audience, and the guy is in his 50's. There's a almost primitive and macabre nature to his performance in MI6, akin to Chaplin, Keaton and Chan. It's easy to ignore just what he's doing and assume we're watching CGI trickery, for sure there's countless safety measures in place and clever VFX, but still, I cannot commend the man enough for his physical performance in this film, it's simply breathtaking.That alone could be enough to deem the film worthy in it's own right. But then, you get bonus upon bonus, a truly outstanding action thriller script by McQuarrie, and virtually faultless direction. Everything in this film is on point, the pacing is near perfect, with the action, save for one main chase scene, always pushing the story along, leading up to one of the best finales I can think of seeing in recent memory. The only real flaw I can point out is that some of the supporting characters get somewhat relegated by the 3rd act, as a result of needing to appease too many pre-existing storylines from previous films, but it was a tricky puzzle to solve for a writer/director coming into a franchise after 4 films, where the main character is meant to be a vehicle, a tool if you will, rather than be a character weighed down with too much. It's a fine balance to tread. But in today's world it's not enough to merely have an action lead like Bond, who has zero backstory and zero personal stakes, beyond saving the world and saving the girl. McQuarrie, Cruise, Abrams and co have done a very good job of taking the character beyond his first 2 iterations. (For the record I HATE MI2, it's just dumb AF). I may need to watch it again to appreciate any flaws or shortcomings, but from the initial viewing, and from someone who went in expecting a lot, I have to say I was not disappointed in the least, along with Avengers Infinity War, this was a sequel and major tentpole film that exceeded and delivered on my expectations. Something I haven't been able to say for some time when it comes to huge budget films. This is most definitely a film you HAVE to see in theaters, if anything for the genuine rollercoaster that is the last 20 minutes. If you like action/thriller/espionage films and aren't overly concerned about absolute realism, and appreciate that films can be an escape and sometime tool for fantasy and imagination, then you will completely adore this film.",

            "content": "It seems that Mission: Impossible's title as a franchise is less of a reference to the intensely difficult missions that the IMF undertake, but is more so referring to the possibility of Ethan Hunt's death. In other words, much of the enjoyment I derived from 'Fallout' was not the 'If' Ethan would survive a perilous skydive or a helicopter crash, but more so 'How' Ethan would survive (We all know he is going to survive - it's a given). And I think the film achieved an incredible spectacle through that as the film could be as outlandish and extreme as it wants, because it doesn't have to worry about believability or feasibility. After all, I stopped questioning the realism of Mission: Impossible a long time ago because it's not the film's focus. Neither is narrative, truly - the narrative is merely a vehicle for the film's action, and action this film certainly has. It's the film's core impetus to keep the audience engaged - and to keep them engaged, there has to be variety. Without it, the film would get stale. Fortunately, the assured direction of the film means there is both focus on how the action is controlled and on how that action consistently builds and builds.Through this building of action, I noticed something impressive about the film's direction - well-controlled cinematography (with barely any egregious shakycam, one of my biggest action film pet peeves), a variety of colour and colourful lighting and a focus on trying to do many stunts practically rather than doing them against a green screen. The no-music car chase was a truly standout scene for me in this regard as the film understood, at least for a brief moment, that simply having pure action, foley and the squealing of burning rubber was far more important than playing the heart racing orchestral film score to make what was happening onscreen more action-packed than it actually was.There's also a charming obsession in 'Fallout' for twists wrapped in more twists like the revelation at the beginning of the film that the hospital the insane manifesto-writing weapons expert, Nils Delbruuk, is in is a set that dramatically falls apart when he gives the IMF the information they need. There are plenty of 'Gotcha' moments like this in 'Fallout' with both the bad guys and the good guys one-upping each other, playing each other for fools - which is certainly indicative of what one could call classic spy-vs-spy espionage, I would think. And it has to be said that there was a moment near the end where it seemed as if the nuclear bombs were detonated and Ethan's friends, his wife and many, many others have just died - but actually it was just the rising of the sun over the mountains. \"You got me with that one, but I'll get you next time, director of the film 'Mission: Impossible - Fallout', Christopher McQuarrie!\"It's not all perfect, obviously. One of the film's most glaring faults is its emotional scenes - neither Ethan's relationship with his ex-wife, Julia, or with Rebecca Ferguson's character Ilsa Faust really left an impact on me. The death of Alec Baldwin's IMF Director character also lacked a lot of punch, especially since he was only introduced in 'Mission: Impossible - Rogue Nation', just before this one. A more prominent issue, however, would probably be the 'reveal' of the villany of Henry Cavill's August Walker. Yeah sorry, 'Fallout' - that was kinda obvious of you, which is a real shame. Considering how well the rest of the movie can play the audience like a fiddle, Cavill's character could have been done way, WAY better. Hell, it would have been more surprising to me if he didn't turn out to be a villain.Overall: mid-to-high 7, borderline 8 maybe?",

I almost stopped watching near the end.\nWitty writing and unexpected plot twists are what made the previous 2 movies so much enjoyable to watch. This barely had any plot twists or any plot at all, and the writing was quite lazy. In the end it's the acting that save the movie for me. Most notable: Simonn Pegg, Ving Rhames and Sean Harris. I was not impressed with Tom Cruise in this movie and definitely not impressed with Henry Cavill. He was such a boring villain. Overall, if you watch it on a big screen with loud speakers and pretend there's no script you might enjoy it much more. For me it was a disappointment.",

            "content": "\"Mission Impossible: Fallout\" Review\n(8.5/10)I want to start by saying I've never really been a Mission Impossible fan, but Rouge Nation I thought was good and refreshing for the franchise, and Fallout keeps the trend going upwards, of course by getting bigger than the previous installment.\nFast paced, stylish and vastly entertaining, this is not only a reminder of how insane Tom Cruise's dedication to delivering big screen thrills is but also a prime example of how movies are originally meant to be watched on the big screen. Christopher McQuarrie makes Fallout feels a lot like the first Mission: Impossiblemovie than any other film in the franchise, but also cleverly takes everything good about the franchise and marinates it all into one movie.\nThe stunts, staged with vigor and a sharp eye for spatial balance by writer-director Christopher McQuarrie, grow wilder as Fallout goes on. And, admittedly, they're a hoot. Cruise brings a work ethic as solid as the movie's narrative ethic is hectic, generously and subtly conducting an outstanding supporting cast that includes M:I veterans Ving Rhames, Simon Pegg, Rebecca Ferguson and Alec Baldwin. Some of Fallout's most delicious scenes, though, feature Cruise and Vanessa Kirby, leaving behind her Princess Margaret persona from \"The Crown\" to play a fascinatingly saucy minx of indistinct motivation.\nMcQuarrie finally asks what sort of man keeps accepting those missions; what drives someone to put their life on the line again and again? For Hunt, the answer is simple. He can save people, and therefore he has a responsibility to act. For Cruise - and McQuarrie - it's an eternal quest to outdo the last effort. They're only making the next one difficult by succeeding this hard.",

            "content": "I Really enjoyed this one. The thing that stands out the most is the stunts and set pieces and way it's all beautifully shot and staged. Where it lacks is the script, which isn't bad, but does include some plot holes (The white widow and Ilsa's supposed conflict, introduced, then never followed through..for instance). Take the opening scene in Berlin. It gets the job done, its sets up the central conflict. Yet the logic of that all happening like that is silly when you really think about it. Ethan Hunt will risk the entire world to save his friend... And then you look at the back and forth dialogue between Ethan, Benji, and Luther that happens before that in the setup of the scene. I get it. I get what they're going for. We're feeling the characters, we're with them in that moment, But its like they wrote all that on the spot and used the first take...The script is serviceable. It's really a very simple plot. 3 Plutonium cores are set loose and the IMF is tasked with tracking them down...Ethan Hunt must then deal with \"the fallout of all his good intentions\" as Solomon Lane so eloquently puts it. The execution of this plot is shaky at times. Whereas GHOST PROTOCOL was a slicker more straightforward version of this one, FALLOUT in its ambition to be better, has a few more patchy spots and plot holes showing where you can tell they were making this all up as they went along. Still, it gets the job done in the end, pretty slickly all things considered... FALLOUT can definitely be considered as \"The Epic\" of The Mission movies. It just feels big. Its the longest runtime, It has the most ambitious stunts staged yet (Tom Cruise climbing up into a helicopter and dangling off of the side, The HALO jump sequence), and it boasts that classy old school feel that all epics do... As I Said before, It's really a more complex yet messy version of GHOST PROTOCOL. The IMF team is trying to prevent nuclear war again (in Ghost it was missiles, here its plutonium cores.) And Once again. Ethan's wife plays an important part in the emotional drive of the story...And at a crucial point in both stories, the team is cut off from all backup and support and forced to go at it alone....Both films achieve as entertainment, but I think Fallout is more ambitious and gives you more, while Ghost Protocol is tighter and maybe more straightforward and easily accessible...It was unexpected but good to see Michelle Monaghan back as Julia. Her brief cameo at the end of Ghost was a nice little surprise twist and seemed a good sendoff to her character. But here she is brought back again, but for a more fleshed out and satisfying closure that I believe is justified. Michelle Monaghan has an easy likable presence on screen and her return should be a treat for long time fans...In FALLOUT Ving Rhames get the most significant amount of screen time and importance to the story that he ever has in any of the films. Which is long overdue. There's nice little appropriate bursts of Simon Pegg throughout as well. Vanessa Kirby is a scene stealer as The White Widow, thanks to the brilliant writing of Chris McQuarrie and the beautiful way in which she is lit. You are left wanting more of her by the end of the film...Henry Cavill makes for a great villain. Finally A baddie that can go toe to toe and throw down with Ethan, give him a run for his money...Ilssa Faust, played perfectly by Rebecca Ferguson, in my opinion is the best thing to happen to the series and completely owned ROGUE NATION. She's back again and her arc is my only significant gripe with the movie. It feels too much a retread of her story in the last one. You are once again left to wonder who's side she's on and everything that happened in ROGUE to progress her character is undone and she is back where she was in the last film. She's still great in the part and overall her story ends up being satisfying by the end, but I couldn't help but notice that..The score by Lorne Balfe, I wasn't sold when I first heard it. I liked the percussive opening and certain motifs but I felt it wasn't memorable and sounded like they couldn't afford Hans Zimmer and hired this dude. But my opinion has changed since then and I think he did pretty well. Although its probably still my least favorite Mission score overall...Chris McQuarrie is great at writing these characters. He also shines in directing action. There is clarity in the geography and in what's going on. There are some breathtaking shots throughout. This may be the best looking Mission...Overall it looks great, the action is insane, there are plenty of twists and turns, and it entertains and thrills you as a film like this should. I really liked it. I really like the relationship and dynamic between Ethan and Ilssa. I Hope it continues to develop because its the most interesting thing about this series at this point in its run...Can't wait for the next one!",

Tom Cruise took a much loved tv series and brought it to the big screen. While I had issues with the way it was done. Namely making the character of Jim Phelps a traitor and killing off the whole team but Ethan Hunt. I stuck with it. The movies were always supposed to be about the missions. This last one was all about Ethan Hunt, or rather, Tom Cruise.This movie was a shameless tribute to Tom Cruise' ego. We get it Tom. You like to do your own stunts. You want to be seen as the hero. You're a nice guy. Men should want to be you and women should want to be with you. Enough already!The plotline was so thin I honestly wondered how much the writers were paid for it. The talent within the cast that was so underused was both frustrating and painful to watch. Some actors had maybe one moment on the screen. Others were simply there as extras to fill the space. I honestly wondered if the other actors names were used as bait to lure in fans, only for the trap to be that we barely get to see any of them while Tom is hogging the camera.Congratulations Mr Cruise. You killed this franchise for me. I'm done. I strongly recommend that everyone save themselves the trouble and don't bother with this farce of strung together stunts and cringe worthy dialogue.",

At that time Bourne was at his best (before fallout Bourne ultimatum was the best spy thriller in my list )and Craig brought new visions to bond.\nTen years later, guess what, Bourne series is almost dead after two crappy movie and bond had an average installment but mission impossible is at its best. This franchise is like Benjamin button, getting better and better in every installment. Tom Cruise has secured his role as Ethan hunt by doing those crazy stunt himself, going further and further in each movie. He is Ethan hunt and he deserves a prize for his dedication.\nConsidering that even mad max left Oscar almost empty handed i don't have much hope that they consider Cruise for any prize. But they should. His dedication and efforts should be admired. He has become the real life super hero.\nWatch Mission:Impossible-Fallout. You won't be disappointed.",

            "content": "First of all, the prosHats off to Tom Cruise. This guy is nearly a senior citizen and he's still performing some of the most mind blowing and difficult stunts in the Hollywood by his own self.This is only Chris McQuarrie third DIRECTED film but he's proven himself to be capable. Especially with action sequences.This film has several long action sequences, chases, gunfights, fist fights and they're all FREAKING AWESOME. The action scenes are coherent and they look plus feel very real. Especially THE BATHROOM FIGHT scene. The fight choreography in that scene was fantastic. It had me salivating for more hand to hand fights.What I love the most is that there weren't any boring parts. Chris McQuarrie knows very well how to incorporate amazing action scenes with the plot so that they won't feel forced and the story will flow well without feeling like action filled fan service.The theme is amazing as always. Had me humming it after I finished the film. Really well used in the scenes where it's supposed to play and get the adrenaline flowing through you.The theme is amazing as always. Had me humming it after I finished the film. Really well used in the scenes where it's supposed to play and get the ADRENALINE flowing through you.for the consThe whole film does feel \"Been there and done that\"Lack of risk taking makes it feel same old same oldThis film had plenty of opportunities to explore the character of Ethan Hunt in depth but instead it trades the opportunities for the same old \"Ethan Hunt is charming.My biggest issue? EXPOSITION. It took a very SPOON FEEDING approach. It was constantly reminding plot points. Over explaining stuff too directly instead of being subtle. Characters blatantly asking other characters what certain things mean so they would get a chance to explain it to us. The audience.The comedy didn't work in this one. Mission Impossible 4 had some great comedy with Benji And Ethan. This one? Awkward jokes and quips that don't really hit the spot. Please, don't become Joss Whedon. This film should be above cringe comedy.Another major issue. The story itself. It goes from A to B to C to D just the way we have known. It follows the FORMULAIC approach, the pattern of its previous films without really trying anything new.It makes up for that with amazing action sequences but over abundance of action sequences may burn some audience members out. I think LESS is MORE. MI 4 had only a handful of big stunts like the Burj Khalifa scene yet each one of them counted.Henry Cavill is intimidating. He LOOKS great. But I feel like he suits kind, innocent, straight forward and clean cut roles more. His acting here could have been better. He didn't come off as clever, experienced side kick he was supposed to feel like.Fall Out is an unnecessary addition to the franchise. It didn't add much to the over arching story. It was entertaining. Don't get me wrong but it didn't go into UNCHARTED TERRITORY and explore new ideas or character dynamics.It was AWESOME and THRILLING as heck BUT it was quite CLICHED and didn't bring anything really new to the tableIf you like action films and MI series, you will love it.I liked it and it had me pumped but I'd say Ghost Protocol and even Rogue Nation were better than this one.I'd say go watch it because there aren't a lot of decent action films out there these days and this is a pretty decent oneOnce again, props to the cast and all of the stunt people too.Final Rating 7.2/10",

No, it doesn't have the most intelligent storyline (or even the most intelligent MI movie storyline) but then how many action movies do?Without question, what we have here is a series of conceptual stunts linked together with a passable, generic-action-movie sequence of events. Usually I'd give a movie of that sort about a 7; this gets a 9 because those concepts are so brilliantly executed and shot that you have to take a step back and applaud. Don't overthink it - let it wash over you, accept it for what it is (and isn't) and you'll have a whale of a time.

Now it's time to rethink that.\nWe always expect to see Tom run and jump and drive and fight and fly and roll and ride, but not for an hour. This is the longest film in the franchise at 147 minutes but it's a 100 minute movie. Running and running and running and running isn't acting. It takes no lines, no talent and no audience. It's just an excuse for poor writing and big egos. I'm really glad I didn't see this in the theater where there are no fast forward buttons.\nThere are still some good things though. Benji finally gets to wear a mask. Twice. Yay. They wrap up the Julia story line, nicely. They wrap up the Hunley story line, nicely. Ilsa finishes her entrapment with MI6 and there's a great shot of Notre Dame before the fire.\nBad things. They lost analyst Brant, Jeremy Renner, because Tom's antics delayed filming so long that he had other obligations. If the team would have had an analyst they would have known who Lark was the first time they saw him, like the audience. Would have been a short story but would have made more sense. It was so contrived and predictable. Lane didn't die. He should have. He should have died in Rogue Nation and this film wouldn't have been necessary and maybe there would have been a good 6th installment instead of what it turned out to be. Angela Bassett is not an asset. Get the CIA out of the autonomous IMF. Finally, they are getting too old. Surrounding Ethan, Luther and Benji with youngsters just makes it worse. So, to quote the last line, \"don't make me laugh\".",

The storyline has merit (albeit a little over the top but thats what you would expect with such a movie) but what stands out are the stunts scenes. Not much CGI was used and you could pretty much Mr Cruise did his own stunts. The film was that good it didn't feel like a 2 and a half hour movie and the pace, emotion, adrenaline, suspense kept me glued to my seat. Go a watch the best Tom Cruise movie in years.This message will self-descruct in 5 seconds.....",

            "content": "WIth how this movie was portrayed I felt there was a huge let down. Yes, in the end, it was an overall good movie. But was equal or better than the hype? Not even close. It did effectively create a situation that caused our main hero have to make a decision that was plausible and a situation that many people in real life must make. But at the same time there was a feeling of 'we knew that it wasn't going to happen' throughout the movie. Defeating the credibility of the movie. Out of all the Mission Impossible sequels I enjoyed this one the best but it still feel into the sequel tropes and the directors decided to make the action and 'intensity' of the movie the forefront of the movie instead of storyline and character development, which in the end would have made this movie epic. The 'enemy' of this movie was one dimensional at best, and if we are honest with each other, then we would admit that the 'enemy' definitively is the equal of the protagonist, if not their superior. Movies done correctly have proved this time and time again. I",

            "content": "Mission Impossible: Fallout, Written and directed by Christopher McQuarrie, starring Tom Cruise, Henry Cavill, Ving Rhames, Simon Pegg, Rebecca Ferguson, Sean Harris, Angela Bassett, and a bunch of other fantastic actors. And this film follows the M.I. Crew as after a mission goes wrong, they set out to correct it and save the world yet again in by far the biggest production and biggest M.I. Film to date. Let's talk about acting first of all, not a single weak link in acting at all. Even with the writing of the characters, not a single character feels out of place or just there to have a big name in it. Cavill in this film though gives my favorite performance. Alongside a bunch of other characters as well. Even in the various action sequences they're a part of is just amazing for all of them. I haven't seen a film like this in a long time that properly used every character in it to their fullest potential and not feel off or just too perfect. Now the action, oh my god, there was so much amazing and nail biting sequences in this film that I'm still processing it. Each sequence in the film felt so original and fresh and so realistic. Like each punch and kick and swing in this film I felt to its fullest potential and it worked so so well in it. Especially the now famous helicopter scene in it, that scene could've been the whole movie and I wouldn't have complained one bit about it. That scene was so intense and felt so gritty and realistic that it reminded me directly of the sequences from Mad Max in it. The story is equally as impressive in this film with the twisting of some rested storylines that have come up in previous films and this film is also the first film in the series that feels like it flows smoothly into the next film as well. Coming right off of rogue nation right into fallout and felt like one continuous story which is so nice to see from these stand alone films that are somehow connected. The story did feel very fresh as well even though it is a storyline that we have seen before in a M.I. movie. With practically no complaints with this film and not a single flaw in sight. I highly recommend seeing this film for it being one of the best action films in years with every shot and sequence just flowing so smoothly and consistently keeping the audience on their toes. Mission Impossible: Fallout gets a 9.75/10",

That doesn't matter any more because Mission Impossible Fallout makes up for all of it! You would think that after 6 movies the series would run out of steam but hey Christopher McQuarrie makes the best one instead! Fallout begins with Ethan Hunt still on the lookout for the rest of the syndicate, he's just following the bread crumbs when the CIA gets involved carrying over that plotline from Rogue nation as well. That sounds simple enough but this movie is a lot deeper than that, it has layers and they are good layers! This story is very different from the other Missions. I love the exploration of Ethan Hunt's morality, you get to see what goes through his head. This movie shows you why Ethan's character is so great and it celebrates that! Henry Cavil could not have been more perfect, he is a force to be reckoned with and he worked so well along side Tom Cruise. It reminded me of Dwayne Johnson in Fast Five. He is just this \"hammer\" that you don't want to be locked in a room with. I also liked how it showed the vulnerability of the heroes, they aren't squeaky clean, they get beat up, they get dirty, and things don't always go the right way. We always route for Ethan and the IMF but this film takes a different approach and asks the question. Sure it's badass to see these giant set pieces and crazy fight scenes but when the chips are down and hard calls have to be made, how far are you willing to go? I love when a movie can ask that question. It adds a whole layer to an already fun film. The direction feels epic. This feels like the biggest challenge Ethan Hunt has ever faced, it brilliantly carries over previous storylines that didn't have the best resolution in other films and it delivers excellent action sequences that had me on the edge of my seat. It's like the \"Skyfall\" of this franchise. Guys Mission Impossible Fallout not only met my expectations, it subverted them and exceeded them! See this in Imax by the way, it's worth the extra money because this was an experience in the theater.",

The opening scene says it all. Ethan the man who values people than his mission yet again lands himself in trouble. Off course this mission is not a choice.It's been 22 years since the first Mission Impossible film hit the theatres, Tom Cruise hasn't changed. He is ready to risk his life for the entertainment of his fans and movie lovers. Every time he takes the risk meter a notch above the earlier one. Be it hanging the cliff, leaping between buildings, boarding a flying helicopter he is the man of action.Fallout is the recent addition to Tom Cruise's best ever franchise. Right from the word go Fallout is a treat. The movie never wasted a minute to suit up. The 148 minutes of entertainment is rich in action, marvel in stunts and brilliant in execution.Unlike other MI movies Fallout is a direct sequel to its predecessor Rough Nation. Off course this is a first time that a director has directed two movies in this franchise. Though the movie is a sequel, one doesn't need to know the story of Rough Nation to watch Fallout, the movie is clear in implying the plot even to someone new to the franchise.When Christopher McQuarrie was announced the director of Fallout, it surprised everyone, as this is the first time a director has directed two movies in Mission Impossible franchise. But, he proved to be the perfect man to direct Fallout. His direction has made Fallout the best in the franchise (According to my opinion).Technically the movie is brilliant, especially the locations where the stunts were performed, like the climax in Kashmir (Though not mentioned in the movie). Fallout stands out the best in the franchise. Music by Lorne Balfe is too good during stunts, his music has elevated the stunts a step higher through his music. Rob Hardy's camera speaks for itself. His work during the stunt scenes are exceptional.Above all the casting is perfect as a bullet. From Ving Rhames to Alec Baldwin, the cast has done justification to their roles. Roping Henry Cavil as Walker is the high point of the movie. Though we miss his action till the climax, he adds perfect flavour to the cast.Mission Impossible Fallout is the best in the franchise so far. Don't miss the action packed 148 minutes. The best action movie of the year.",

The story is made to continue quite seamlessly between the two, and the viewer experiences in the latter the unsettling possibility of releasing a prisoner that the team worked so hard to capture in the former. I think that is key in justifying the first 2+ hours of this film. Once again, the action and espionage blend very well, albeit this one leans just a touch heavier on the action. I think the quality that I enjoyed in Rogue Nation is maintained here, and character decisions and action remain majorly justifiable. Perhaps the detractor, which almost downgraded my vote to an 8, is the later half of the helicopter sequence in the final chapter. The chase was thrilling, and knowing that Cruise flew the helo himself after hundreds of hours of training adds immense value to it. They just should have stayed a touch more grounded and plausible in the post-crash scenes. There are too many instances of subsequent slides and crashes that the human body would just not survive... Not even if you're Ethan Hunt! Yes, I am aware the character gets away with entirely too much, but the subtle suspension of disbelief will mask it until it no longer can, and my hypothetical line was crossed in this one.Nevertheless, the movie is capable of gluing one's eyes to the screen, and the plot remains interesting all the way through. A significant part of that success is the fact that, in both of the movies mentioned here, the antagonist's motivation is actually reasonable, just not his methods. One of my pet peeves is when a story presents a villain whose cause makes no sense or is not explained well. Thankfully, Rogue Nation and Fallout do not fall into that pitfall.Overall, well done! Fallout and Rogue Nation take their place among my all-time favourite action movies, which makes me look forward to the upcoming Dead Reckoning sequels which are made by the same director and writers.",

It has nothing as calculated, clever, sexy, or as well put together as the opera scene from Rogue Nation.Fallout is like Ghost Protocol, a series of stunt ideas strung together in lieu of a well written narrative.Definitely worth watching, but don't expect the action classic many (most?) reviews proclaim.In my honest opinion.",

Some elements that make the movie less Bond-ish... Stunts and action scenes that go just a bit beyond defying the laws of Physics. Also teamwork.I've watched all the MI movies in the past few months, and every new film just keeps getting better. Let's hope the upcoming \"Dead Reckoning\" does not break the streak.",

The film is also helped by outstanding performances by all the cast, including more than a cameo of Monaghan. Cavill was a great addition, as a fan of his performances in the likes of Man From Uncle, he fit in nicely. Kirby also played out of type-cast brilliantly and almost stole the show.The only one we don't get to see is Renner due to scheduling conflicts with the Marvel series, but we live in hope to see him under this franchise again.McQuarrie returns from Rogue Nation to direct again, and he does a superb job, the action scenes are flawless and captured vividly, but with out the hectic cinematics which have plagued so many actions films, making for an enjoyable experience rather than a headache inducing one.The CGI is good, again, with only minor flaws and some glitchy or shall we say less than perfect transitions.I cannot say enough how much I enjoyed the classic fast paced edge of your seat film they have created here, this series had some duds in it's middle, but this is definitely one of the best so far, and such a joy to watch.",

            "content": "Reel Review: Mission Impossible: Fallout\nBy Nelson Nantanapibul\nWritten and directed by Christopher McQuarrie\nStarring: Tom Cruise, Henry Cavill, Ving Rhames, Simon Pegg, Rebecca Ferguson, Sean Harris, Angela Bassett, Alec Baldwin\n I have only seen one other Mission Impossible film prior to Fallout and that was MI:II with Thandie Newton. Tom Cruise as always gives his all in his performance as Ethan Hunt and even does a great many of the stunts in the film. In fact he actually injured himself during one of the stunts which caused a delay in filming. Henry Cavill plays a new character August Walker and he is so great and badass. I may be a bit biased as I am a huge Henry Cavill fan and he is a great Superman as far as I'm concerned. \n Ving Rhames and Simon Pegg return as Luther and Benji and they really compliment Tom Cruise's performance. They have been in six of these films together now and they have really great chemistry. Rebecca Ferguson is such a delight and I've been a fan of hers since I first saw her in that Dwayne Johnson Hercules film and in The Greatest Showman with Hugh Jackman. \n The film has some really great action sequences and some really great cinematography work. There are a couple of great car chase scenes in this movie and there is even a nail biting helicopter chase sequence unlike anything I have ever seen. Fallout ties up some loose ends seeded in some of the previous Mission Impossible films. \n Ethan in this film comes to terms with some of the \"fallout\" of the kind of life that he leads. How it has affected his happiness and those around him that he loves and cares for. Ethan is different than a character like James Bond in that Bond has some moral ambiguity especially in the current films featuring Daniel Craig as the Bond character. \n Ethan values the life of his team and will not sacrifice them in order to accomplish his missions. He tries to minimize the amount of collateral damage that comes with partaking in one of these dangerous assignments to the best of his abilities. There was one scene in the film that really epitomizes the value he places on human life including that of a complete stranger. \n Fallout is a really fun and action packed film. McQuarrie does a great job not only tying up loose ends from previous films but this film is in no way an ending to the franchise. The door is still wide open for future films and if this film is as successful as previous installments then I am sure that there will be. I really enjoyed this film and I think you should check it out.",

Sure, there was a little bit of familiarity and the basic structure was somewhat formulaic, but 'Rogue Nation' had enough freshness and so much fast and furious excitement and thrills it doesn't feel like an issue. Contrary to the critical consensus that 'Mission Impossible-Fallout' is the best 'Mission Impossible' film, personally don't quite agree. It is definitely one of the best ones, and perhaps third place behind 'Ghost Protocool' and 'Rogue Nation' (my personal favourite). It does have a little too much going on in places and things get too complicated in spots. Ving Rhames is underused and doesn't seem to be enjoying himself in a basically nothing role. Some of the dialogue is also somewhat forced. Visually, 'Mission Impossible-Fallout' is even slicker and even more stylish than 'Ghost Protocool' and 'Rogue Nation', surpassing the latter as perhaps the most audacious of all six films put together. The locations, from sinister drabness to stunningly colourful, are a feast for the eye and the effect dazzle. The music doesn't overbear the action and such at all while making a pulsating impact thanks to the thrillingly authentic sound. The action is bigger, bolder and more dynamic than any other action scenes seen before in the previous four instalments. Many are breath-taking in their excitement and also nuances, hard to pick a favourite with such spectacular stunts and action scenes between the lightning storm, the motorcycle chase, the helicopter battle, the car chase, the London sprints and the toilet martial arts fight. Christopher McQuarrie's directing is again some of the best he's ever done, with a great sense of visual style and a real grasp of the storytelling. 'Mission Impossible-Fallout' script is generally sharp, knowingly sophisticated with the humour (not cheesy or out of place) and intrigue superbly balanced. The story, the series' heaviest, darkest and most ambitious, is told at a breakneck pace without being rushed and grips one right in and never lets go, with the backstories providing some depth. There is, like with 'Rogue Nation' an appealing light-heartedness, tongue-in-cheek and suspense of superior tension and elegance (as far as the 'Mission Impossible' films go). Tom Cruise is very impressive, handling the stunts with effortless and enviable ease and acting with steely charisma. Rebecca Ferguson shows an even better and more confident knack for scene-stealing, with her in ersatz breath-of-fresh-air form. Sean Harris and Henry Cavill intimidate effectively, while Simon Pegg's comic relief in no way jars and is actually very funny and Jeremy Renner's presence is more than welcome. Vanessa Kirby, Alec Baldwin and Michelle Monaghan are also strong. It is a shame however that Ving Rhames is underused and lacking the charisma that he showed in 'Rogue Nation' despite being under-utilised in that too. On the whole, very good, just not amazing. One of the better 'Mission Impossible' films though and among the better films of the year, if not among the very best. 8/10 Bethany Cox.",

Perhaps the worst offense of all is the way that this film distrusts the audience to handle its formulaic and simplistic plot (even resorting to show us a flashback of something we saw just a few minutes earlier.) I see nothing here that hasn't already been done better in other movies - and I just don't understand the praise it is receiving.",

A compelling rivalry between Tom Cruise and Henry Cavill keeps you on the edge of your seat during a flurry of chase scenes and fight scenes. This is the best rivalry in this franchise since MI3 when Cruise was up against the late Philip Seymour Hoffman. Ethan Hunt's team all return and are n fine form as always! Be prepared for a long sit! At two and a half hours this is a very long movie, and frankly exhausting! Whilst it is good fun, it is too long and you can find yourself having viewers fatigue. However do not let that keep you back from what is the best instalment from the MI franchise! This movie may have some flaws, but it is certainly the best action movie to come out in 2018.",

            "content": "To be honest, I think the best action movies have to tell a story worth telling without pandering so much to the adrenaline seeking tantrums inside of all of us. Take for example, The Dark Knight where although it's an action film, it tells a more complex and deeper, even metaphysical story about its characters. This builds tension and allows the tension to seep into the story, and eventually culminate into the action.Well the story of this movie is sort of typical Hollywood- a guy has three bombs that he wants to use to blow up the world to fulfill his \"purpose\". So basically your stock character, evil \"i'm not a terrorist\" but secretly is dude who gets his ass kicked in the end.Is the action good? Definitely. The choreography for the action is really well done, and the cinematography is excellent. I think this movie honestly deserves 7 stars but because of that amazing and unexpected Motorcycle chase I will give it an extra star.I know there are people that would absolutely love the socks of this movie though, and for those people I will say my piece and walk away. But I also would like to say that the last scene with the helicopters seemed like something out of a GI Joe cartoon, although I did appreciate the adrenaline rush and stunts performed during those scenes, I could not say that I ever truly immersed myself within this movie due to its sort of laughable villain, cheesy story at heart, and somewhat generic set-pieces.Is it the best in the series? For me, no, because it still doesn't scream \"iconic\" to me as an action film. Is it a good movie with good action? Yes. Definitely yes, it's a good film, but in my opinion it lacks the consistent tension and general following with the audience to be a great one.",

            "content": "Mission Impossible 6 Fallout is the sixth installment of Mission Impossible series. Oscar winning writer Christopher McQuarrie helms as director for second time after Mission Impossible 5 Rogue Nation. Tom Cruise is Ethan Hunt for the sixth time and it is his playground and he has done it with elan. Be it bike chase or truck chase or running on foot or hanging precariously on cliffs is really unmatched for the actor at his age. He fractured his leg while doing the giant leap in London across buildings and shooting was stalled for a period. The plotline is complex akin to Mission Impossible first installment. The film opens with Ethan Hunt dreaming and wakes up from sleep in Belfast and hears the doorbell and a messenger delivers his assignment. From here action shifts to Berlin and the mission goes awry as Hunt takes split second decision to save one of his team members and loses out on the three plutonium cores which he is supposed to retrieve ands it ultimately falls into wrong hands that plan to use it for water contamination. CIA chief played by Angela Bassett wants to take over the mission from IMF headed by Hunley played by Alec Baldwin and Ethan Hunt team. So CIA chief sends one of his special operatives assassin August walker played by Henry Cavill to oversee and also somehow claim the credits for the mission by recovering the stolen plutonium. Both of these jump from air to Paris. From this moment it is almost nonstop action. We have arms dealer John Lark and arms broker played by svelte Vanessa Kirby nicknamed white widow who is the daughter of Max from Mission Impossible first part, Solomon Lane, mastermind anarchist played from Sean Harris from Rogue Nation and also Ilsa Faust, a former MI6 played by Rebecca Ferguson with vigor also from Rogue Nation with a mission of her own and Julia, Hunt's ex-wife played by Michelle Monaghan. Hunt is supported by his usual Benji played by Simon Pegg and Stickell played by Ving Rhames. It takes a while to understand and identify the real antagonist of the movie which is revealed with the stabbing of IMF chief. Technically brilliant with excellent visual effects support along with taut story and screenplay as it will enthrall many movie lovers which is rare in the current technology driven days of movie making. Lorne Balfe does justice as composer aided by charismatic Lalo Schifrin theme. Cinematographer Rob Hardy needs special mention for capturing all the aspects in alluring galore which is an asset to this action espionage thriller. Definitely movie lovers who are also lover of sound effects can very well go in for IMAX version. Worth watching hard hitting action thriller in recent times.",

It's the first one that as the scenes happen, most of them you can look at and go \"that could happen\".Definitely a must-see.

            "content": "An interesting idea is introduced at the start of Fallout; if it would come to it, would Ethan Hunt be able to choose the mission and sacrifice his friend for the greater good. This idea is carried through to a certain point of the movie, but is ultimately dropped and the climax of the film is the usual save the world from a nuclear blast business. The old familiar faces return from Rogue Nation and Henry Cavil is introduced as a CIA secret agent who is sent along with Hunt to make sure he doesn't screw up the mission. Fallout is a sequel to the previous one. The plot here isn't anything new. A terrorist group wishes to destroy the old world order by blowing up couple of nuclear bombs. Their motives aren't interesting and in fact, the film itself isn't interested in opening them. They say a couple of preachy lines how suffering creates peace, but doesn't go deeper than that. Frankly, it doesn't have to. I'm here for the action. And there are some really good looking action scenes. The night time sky diving in Paris is visually impressive and the fight scene that takes place in the bathroom is very satisfying. It's always a funny turnaround when a big guy like Henry Cavil gets his ass kicked. The first half of the film is the part that works best for me. There's a clear plot and cool action scenes. By the time we reach the half point there's so much going on. The plot gets rather heavy with so many threads that it feels like the film loses its way. The villain and the MI6 agent from Rogue Nation return, there's a philanthropist who's actually a weapons smuggler, a distrust going on between CIA and IMF and also the mysterious identity of a plutonium buyer. The film focuses on heavily on the latter one for the first half. It goes so far as to at one point Ethan is suspected to be the said buyer. At that moment you can clearly see that there's a twist coming and how it's going to turn out. Luckily, when the twist happens the film takes an unexpected turn and doesn't go down the predictable road that has been taken so many times in so many films before. Too bad that its most interesting aspect of choosing between the mission and your friends turns into complete the mission or everyone dies in a nuclear explosion.",

All other movies have been somewhere between meh and pretty good but this is the first I believe to be truly great.Honestly every action scene was one of the best action scenes I've seen. The motorcycle chase was the best motorcycle chase I've seen. The Halo jump was the best skydiving sequence I've seen. So on and so forth. All this is mostly because of how obviously real it is, with Tom Cruise laying it all on the line for the audience and a team of people who clearly cared about making the most fun movie possible. Also it definitely helps that it's really well filmed, Christopher Mcquaries direction is intense and sleek. It also has a much darker and ominous tone than the rest of the franchise, which I think was also in part because of how much the score deviates from the traditional 70s spy score in favour of something much more like a Hanz Zimmer score.Another thing I really enjoyed about this movie was how it was a true sequel to Rogue Nation and brought in aspects that weren't simply meant for an anthology movie. This extra awareness made the movie alot more engaging.There are a couple of things you could point to as negatives if you wanted to, but honestly they're so overshadowed by the positives that it won't bother most people but I'll mention it anyway. The plot itself is pretty regular mission impossible affair and in the end it does wrap up in the same sort of way that they all do so the next movie won't really have to deal with any crazy consequences, which I felt this movie could've been setting up considering how much darker it was.Besides all that this is one of the best action movies around, and after watching this most superheros movies look like they were made by babies.

            "content": "Having recently watched two action movies in theater this summer - Jurassic World, and Skyscraper, I went into this movie expecting it to be clearly better than the other two. I came out a bit underwhelmed to be honest. What bothered me most is how hard they try to explain every single thing that happens in the movie. Ethan's character's motive is explained by so many people at different times and its just the same old cliche boring and patriotic speech (he's out there to serve the country, save the world and he can't look away when something goes wrong yada yada). They do the same with the bad guy's motives too. When I think of Mission Impossible, I think of it as an American Bond movie but it simply lacks any sophistication. Yes, MI is also typically big on action and stunts and can be quite in your face, but is it really necessary to dumb it down so much? Part of what makes movies great is to keep people thinking. Here, it's pretty clear - someone is going to blow stuff up. But they still want to spell it out and make it clear incase you couldn't guess that Tom Cruise was going to jump on that Helicopter. Plot is pretty mediocre and unbelievable - the bad guys already have hold of the small pox virus that can potentially infect close to 3 billion people in the region (in Asia), yet they are after a nuclear device (which would cost far less damage). And they want the nuclear device not to kill people but incinerate a glacier in Himalayas that would cut off water supply to the said billions of people, hence starving them. Okay, not very practical but whatever, it's a movie. Apart from that, the action sequences are pretty great, what you expect from MI. The scenes in Himalayas are visually stunning. 7/10",

The more than two and a half hours that it lasted seemed like only 1 hour, and in the end I ended up asking for more. This more than known that Tom Cruise knows what he does and knows what the viewer likes, as well as the director Christopher McQuarrie. Excellent action scenes, combined with much suspense and good performances, far from me, the franchise has been rising in meteoric quality from Ghost Protocol, and this last one to be one of the best in the series.

So, what I didn't liked:\ncharacter Ethan - it gave me an impression of a very impulsive and a stupid guy... which should have been killed a million times alreadyA lot of scenes were very exaggerated and predictableThe whole story line was not great - actually really weakIn the final, there are 15 minutes where the guys are having time to defuse a bomb.

Dear cristics, from your point of view is a : boring, self centered, bad(from twists to plot) etc etc. Why you still watch Hollywood movies then just to expose your \"well argumented and documented\" negativity. Its not bad at all, although not perfect, but hey, if you want a philosophical, sex centered thriller you are in a wrong place. \nI know, i know, im not a critic but im a fanatic movie watcher and i have seen few in my life, especially action. I sit down and more than 2 hours i could not stand up, it captivated me the pace, set-up, twists which made it perfect to loose yourself next your fav snack and drink and savor non stop action from a to z.\nI have seen far worse and boring James Bond's.\nSo, for all who gave 1 out of 10 shame! Next time watch some bollywood action flicks it might be better and start rating them.No offense, but you are too subjective in your evaluation because you got upset and cannot think.\nthanks God,i relieved myself and looking forward another MI chapter. Peace.",

It's good enough to warrant the absolute recommendation to see it IN the theater (Dolby is my preference). I'll also point out what the movie did not have, which contributed to my 8.5 stars. I didn't recognize too much PC hidden agenda crap. It was just a great action movie, acted well, written well, and filmed well. I believe in the 10 star continuum, so I'll mention that for me 10 is reserved strictly for films I found truly extraordinary, and always will (not likely to exceed 5 in total). 9 stars is obviously just short of that and still must have significant long term impact for me to attribute. Thus, I'm just providing context to convey that MI Fallout is definitely a 10 with respect to action movies in my opinion.",

            "content": "Ok. Where do I begin. \nPros:\nBefore watching Mission Impossible 6, I rewatched Mission Impossible 1 (Tom Cruise 1996) and also watched Mission Impossible 5. Both films I couldn't complete watching. They were too long and just seemed to drag on. That did not happen this time! It started slow (first 5-10 minutes) and then suddenly exploded into an action packed great movie. Music was revamped and sounded better than in any previous MIs. Fighting scenes were exactly as they would be if I was directing the film so this is by far the best sequel in the history of sequels for a 6th in the series. They worked hard. They didn't cash in. All star cast too. \nCons:\n1. The fake English accent from one of the women (Rebecca Ferguson who plays Ilsa). For some strange reason Americans love fake English accents. We (English) hate it! You wouldn't like to hear a fake American accent, why on Earth do you expect us to tolerate fake English accents! Stop it! Seriously. You're alienating an entire country just to please yourselves.\n2. Too long. They're all way too long. \nThat's enough to drag the mark down to 8/10. Perhaps 7/10 but that would be unfair considering the numerous positives and the fact that this is by far the best film I've seen in at least 2-3 years. \nWas I entertained? Yes. Was it an enjoyable movie? Certainly.Therefore it deserves a 9. Great scenery. Great stunts. Great chasing scenes with the correct dose of realism & humour. Good acting. Great music (I know I've said this before but they really improved the Mission Impossible score).The plot has been kept reasonably straight forward. In some of the previous Mission Impossibles they tried so hard to complicate the plot you'd have been forgiven for thinking you were back in school studying for an exam! Too many cooks spoiling the broth. This time it felt like they fought against making that mistake for as long as they possibly could.",

            "content": "\"The Last Movie Star.\"If one were to write a biography of Tom Cruise, that would have to be the title. Over the past several decades, Hollywood has come to rely less and less on the draw of large personalities. Most blockbusters are now marketed with spectacle and imagery, not names above the title. Yet Cruise remains. Like a dogged survivor in one of his films, he's living history stalking the tall grass of change, continually proving his own industry wrong.And, if \"Mission: Impossible - Fallout\" is any indication, he has no intention of slowing down. Not only is the movie the most action-packed of the series, it may also be the best. Mind, this doesn't mean it's a masterpiece; the bar hasn't been set especially high when it comes to depth and intelligence. But if you enjoy the franchise, particularly the last two entries, it would be a true chore to dislike this one.The plot-always secondary in these films, always a bit too complicated for its own good-begins in Belfast. There, IMF* agent Ethan Hunt (Cruise) learns of a splinter group of assassins who call themselves the 'Apostles' and have essentially become terrorists-for-hire. They're trying to get their hands on a trio of recently-stolen plutonium cores (you can guess the reason). Also involved are an anarchist named John Lark and the previous film's villain, Solomon Lane (Sean Harris).After a botched exchange in Berlin, in which the plutonium is lost, Hunt and his team (Simon Pegg, Ving Rhames) are tasked by IMF Secretary Alan Hunley (Alec Baldwin) with recovering the cores through a meeting in Paris between Lark and a black-market broker known as the White Widow (Vanessa Kirby). Still with me? Suffice to say aborted directives, double-crosses and general chaos follow the key players from Europe all the way to the edge of the Himalayas, where Hunt's past finally catches up with him.One thing I greatly admire in movies is ambition. As evidenced by the story, \"Fallout\" holds nothing back. Whether or not it covers the most geographic ground in the franchise, it plays like the biggest entry. Whereas past missions were stop-gaps, this is a culmination. Stakes rise, secrets are revealed; lives change.At least, on screen. Oh that such emotions extended to the audience. But, for the most part, that effect has been absent from M:I's M.O. for quite some time. Not since the third movie did the narrative forsake its glossy, stunt-riddled surface to mine genuine feeling. And M:I-3 made the least amount of money in the franchise, so it's understandable that such a personal direction would be rerouted. But without it, \"Mission: Impossible\"-and \"Fallout\" specifically-is destined to be the prettiest belle at a second-rate ball. For all its globe-trotting, it's only a partial experience. We see all-and are amazed-but feel little, and remember less. Each character is more caricature than human being, trading the details of life for the whims of a streamlined script. Like \"Marvel\" or \"The Fast and the Furious,\" \"Fallout\" doesn't present reality; it paraphrases it.Some may call this nitpicking, and they wouldn't be far off. But the bar must be raised when it comes to depth, because it's already been surpassed in nearly every other aspect. Visually, \"Fallout\" is a ball of frenetic joy, a feast for the eyes. The scenery is always changing; we can imagine the cameras struggling to keep up with such a rapidly unfolding plot. That plot, though, can be its own worst enemy. There are only so many twists a story can stand before each one starts to mean a little less.Thankfully, other factors maintain our attention. Lorne Balfe's score adds some taught variation to Lalo Schifrin's classic theme. And while each member of the cast does fine, Henry Caville stands out as a mysterious CIA officer. The role fits him better than Superman's tights.But in the end, it all comes back to Cruise. He's the reason we watch, and his relentless energy fuels the entire franchise. \"Fallout\" runs Hunt through the requisite gauntlet of stunts: hanging from a helicopter above mountainous terrain; speeding through the packed streets of Paris on a motorcycle; skydiving from thirty-thousand feet. But more than death-defying acrobatics is the quality they signify: devotion. When an actor who has nothing left to prove consistently gives everything he's got, admiration is easy.* In case you were curious, 'IMF' stands for Impossible Missions Force.",

            "content": "This film is such waste of Tom Cruise talent due to poor story and screenplay. Portrayal of Henry cavill is very bad and his part is not suiting this franchise also as antagonist- bad casting. Except for bike chase in France nothing is good in this film.Climax is also similar to ghost protocol. Another thing for such a mass film they couldn't even hire a good composer , Lorne Balfe remade most of sound from the dark knight rises. He couldn't even make chase scene interesting with horrible composition. Joe Kramer did a fantastic job in MI5 mainly I liked Moroccan pursuit. Michael Giacchino also good in MI4. My expectation from Christoper McQuarrie is also very high. His The Usual Suspects is my all time favourite. I thought MI2 will be worst film in the franchise. But this film gives tough competition.",

            "content": "Mission: Impossible - Fallout continues the natural progression of the last two installments. It is what you expect if you are familiar with other Mission: Impossible movies. In fact, the movie already suppose you are, because it tries to surprise you with innovative action scenes and a high number of plot twists. And it manges with some breathtaking scenes, like the fake news issue, the awesome arrival at Paris, the bathroom fight, the scene in London underground or the rooftop chase. But once finished with surprises, its rhythm is difficult to follow in the last act. From my point of view, it could have ended with 15 minutes less. Because it gets a little bit lost in action scenes and the really interesting issues are recovered at the very end, in the hanging helicopter scene. Appart form that, the film is highly entertaining. Perfect pop-corn movie for a summer night. Tom Cruise never lets you down, and he is in his iconic role. Henry Cavill is a good addition, Simon Pegg is good as always, Ving Rhames shows he is at the level for the team, and Rebbeca Ferguson reprise an increasingly interesting role for the saga. Vanessa Kirby does a magnificent job with her mysterious White Widow, And finally, I missed Jeremy Renner after his performances in last two movies.Mission: Impossible - Fallout is what you expect: action, surprises and entertainment for the summer. Very recommendable and a very worthy sixth installment in a saga with a quality level difficult to reach. How good is Mission: Impossible - Fallout? Like Ethan Hunt himself says: 'The usual'",

Im debating making a road trip just to see this thing on an Imax screen. The halo jump in particular is quite astonishing. The camerawork with the lit up city underneath was remarkable. Henry Cavill did pretty good in his role. I thought he improved as the film went on. Vanessa Kirby's character was brilliant. Glad to see Ving Rhames get some extra screen time also. The score by Lorne Balfe was pretty fantastic. My favorite variation on the original theme since Danny Elfman's. My only complaint is it goes on a bit long and has a few spots that drag a bit. This one might just be my favorite since the first",

To me a great movie is a movie you immediately wanna watch again. This movie didn't do that for me I put it in the top two of the six Mission impossible movies the problem is at least for me is I shouldn't read what critics say because they get your expectations up so high and when you watch the movie and it doesn't quite live up to that you feel a little disappointed. Usually at least three or four of us will go and see a movie and then we get outside if were out there for a while talking about it it's either because of bad movie or it's a good movie none of us really had a lot to say about this movie there were scenes in it that left you wanting to see more like the bathroom fight scene that was great of course some of Tom cruises crazy stunts but there wasn't a whole Lotta memorable things about this movie. But I will say this to me it was better than infinity war and black panther. I'll tell you movie I really love particularly the last 10 or 15 minutes because there's one scene in a movie and you know what I'm talking about my jaw hit the ground when I seen that was the first sicario movie. I thought that was a great movie but this is just my opinion I thought this was a good movie go judging for yourself and have a good time",

It gets bogged down by the somewhat mediocre acting, but this is mainly caused by poorly written dialogue so the actors aren't all to blame. All in all, this is definitely an above-average action film, and if that's the genre you're into, I highly recommend seeing this worthwhile addition to the MI saga. SCORE: 7/10",

The cinematography is mind blowing! Fantastic looking shots on real locations with hardly any cgi used. The story is adult, complex, twists and turns and it requires you to think. The score is also is awesome and reminiscent of The Dark Knight with its dark \"wubs\"The action in this is another thing entirely. Firstly it's so refreshing not to see fake backgrounds and millions of $$$ of CGI in every shot, it feels like actual shots, like an old fashioned movie. Standouts are the bathroom fight, the vehicle chase and the foot chase. The stunts in this are insane and looks and feels real (because 95% of it is I guess)Only negative for me but I can't go into too much detail is there is a reveal about halfway though the movie that I saw coming straight away.. Overall I loved this movie, it gets your heart pounding, it's exciting and more action movies should be like this these days.. superheros are cool and all, but this... this is an action movie!",

What adds suspense and unpredictability to the story is when Ethan and his team are put to the test as they fail to initially stop the Apostles from getting the plutonium, leaving the credibility of their team in doubt. Throw in a CIA agent into the mix, the plot's intrigue gets exciting at every turn. A great action film to pass the time!",

From the opening set piece to the literally cliffhanging finale the pace never lets up. The script is the best of the MI movies to date and the action is thrilling and at times brutal. You have to hand it to Tom Cruise, even at his age, he still.finds ways to amaze and enthrall his audience with his incredible dedication to stunt work and entertainment. He doesn't make bad films!

I also wouldn't have to worry about the franchise killing off Ilsa either because she's practically stronger than Ethan in combat.I never expected this franchise to keep going strong like this, but M:I just may have become Tom Cruise's showcase franchise.As long as they bring back McQuarrie to direct the next sequel, I will have no doubt that M:I will be worth watching and stronger than ever.",

It stars Tom Cruise once again as Ethan Hunt with Simon Pegg, Ving Rhames, and Alec Baldwin back in their roles from previous MI films. This is the epitome of a summer movie. Multiple car chases through exotic locations, a brutally exciting bathroom fight scene (brilliantly choreographed), and a 'take your breath away' helicopter chase sequence. All of this supports the continuation of Ethan and the crew's involvement with tracking down The Syndicate and its new followers appropriately named The Apostles who are hell bent on wreaking nuclear havoc upon the world. The real stars of this movie, however, are the Director, Christopher McQuarrie (who also directed the previous MI film Rogue Nation which began this story arc as well as previous writing responsibilities for The Usual Suspects, Edge of Tomorrow amongst others), and Editor Eddie Hamilton (Rogue Nation, Kingsmen: Golden Circle, Kick Ass, Kick Ass 2 and others). Together, McQuarrie and Hamilton deliver a rapid-fire, edge-of-your-seat roller coaster ride that is an absolute joy to watch. Cruise, who produced the film and did many of his own stunts, once again shines as a bonafide action movie hero. So your mission-which you should definitely choose to accept-is to buy a ticket, get some popcorn, and sit back and be prepared for an exhilarating viewing experience.",

            "content": "Tom Cruise steps out of his comfort zone and does the most intense stunts AN ACTOR has ever done. This is one of his best acting roles (outside of his dramatic accomplishments). He represented an experienced veteran, but showed the same level of intensity and fighting that we see in the previous 5 films Chris McQuarrie is a genius. From the time that Rogue Nation came out in 2015 to now, he completely shuffled his team. He intended this movie to look and feel different than the rest of the franchise, yet still be in line with his vision. I believe if a movie is well made, the same director should return and do the sequel just as McQuarrie did here. The plot was complicated and had me holding my breath at several points. Simon Pegg and Ving Rhames add their comic relief and continue to sustain 2 supporting roles that are essential for these films' success. Rebecca Ferguson was a great addition to the team and her story perfectly coincided with the main plot. Many films these days tie in plots from prequels and sequels just to have another A-list actor to increase production value. However, she was meant to be in it and it didnt feel rushed or forced. She also lost an incredible amount of weight which may have taken away from her attractiveness; but maybe that's just me. Henry Cavill FINALLY portrayed his action movie acting potential. His fight scenes were some of the best I have ever witnessed. His muscle memory from man of steel, BvS, and JL, came in handy. THANKS DC, AT LEAST YOU GAVE US THIS!! I have never been more happy with a secret villain casting. I totally didn't see it coming. Probably because I was paying more attention to his mustache. I felt the punches and I felt his demise. Wonderful depiction. I loved how Solomon Lane intended on Julia's arrival in Kashmir. I thought that hiding the fact that she was there until the end was precisely well thought out. He is a revenge driven villain, which are some of the best developed and 3 dimensional villains that the audience can covertly relate to. \nNow.\nWhat is the reason I didn't give it a 10 if all I have to offer is praise?\nOne of my biggest gripes for Hollywood is the in-authenticity of recent films and the anxious need to push out films for a quick 200 million. If you HAVEN'T seen Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom yet, don't read any further...So, what is happening with these massive franchises? The studios are INSISTING that they continue past their prime, and clearly, past their expiration date. Jurassic World was good in itself. It served the purpose of showing a new park and a new take on the control of the dinosaurs; etc. Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom was a filler, trash movie that was sloppily put together and contained a plot that collapsed on itself. The end presented an opportunity for the franchise to stop making reboot sequels. All she had to do was not press the button that opened the doors that would release the dinosaurs into America. But the little girl did. The difference of justifiably ending a reboot sequel duo and forcing yet another reboot sequel just to make another 200 million or so, was to press or not press that button. It just grinds my gears that these studios think that we will continue to spend money on sloppy reboot sequels. How does this have to do with the end of MI6? During the second to last scene, where TC is climbing the cliff to defuse the bombs, the scenes cut to Benji and Luther defusing the bombs in the village with all of the other main characters, including Julia. As TC gets to the top of the cliff, and is about to pick up the detonator, a huge white light erupts behind him. This sequence had me on the edge of my seat, as the other films final \"race-against-time\" theme, did. But this was different, when the white light went off, I was at peace with the franchise, I was so exhilarated that the franchise had bravely decided to go in this direction. But I was wrong. He had defused the bomb and the white light was just him blacking out from his serious injuries. I was devastated. I couldn't believe they would flirt with this idea. It just blew me away that they had that opportunity and bypassed it, effortlessly. No one in Hollywood has the guts to think outside the box anymore. This ending could have set this film apart and truly made a name for itself, but instead it proved, yet again, that no mission is truly impossible for Tom Cruise. That ending could have even warranted an interesting MI7 where Ethan has to deal with his failure and the fact that everyone he loved and cared about was dead because he couldn't get the job done. Maybe it shows him getting revenge on the apostles and going full Kill Bill on all of them as a rogue, independent operative. I dont know but come on guys, START TO THINK OUTSIDE THE BOX. You will still earn 200 million plus for these sequels if you go in a unique direction. PLEASE.",

It still has some dialogue that could have been cut as it doesn't add to the film. It doesn't take away anything from it either, but I just felt that those parts were a bit pointless and meaningless.

The problem for me was the storyline, or lack thereoff. If you spend so much budget on a movie, why not make sure the underlying story is just as strong as the stunts? The plot was questionable, unrealistic, outdated, predictable and boring. And that makes that the chases, the running, the accidents and so on nice to watch, but not very thrilling. Been there, done that...I watched the movie in 3D. But somehow, instead of adding to the experience, it actually took away from it. So, summing it up: very well made, but not a thrill ride.",

The bar has been raised for all movies after watching this movie. It will be very hard to find movies as good as this especially from previous years because no movie I've seen has this much high octane action and jaw dropping stunts and just stellar action scenes. Other movies will pale in comparison to this one so yeah good luck trying to find better movies than this after watching this.ProsTom Cruise is awesome\nHenry Cavill is awesome\nEveryone acted well including the actor playing Lane\nGreat action/stunts\nVery amazing story\nExhilarating flickConsTom Cruise looks somewhat old in the movie and it made me sad because I wanted Tom to never age and keep giving us great movies (Tom has made some of the best movies ever made and throughout his career his given one hit after another with each new movie especially the M: I movies being better than the previous ones). But his acting was even better than usual and I still wonder how he makes some exact and awesome expressions and makes it all look so easy. He is truly the greatest actor in the world.One thing which is minor but in the beginning of the movie anti religious sentiment is demonized a bit with one of the bad guy characters having been anti religion. This character is expelled because of anti religious sentiments but this I thought was a bit bad and thankfully it wasn't a major subplot because well religiosity is at the heart of corruption and religions are behind most evils in the world so to stand up for the bad religions like this was a bit of a downer but not a major subplot so it doesn't hurt what is otherwise an outstanding movie which deserves awards for a lot of things like acting, writing, direction, stunts, action etc etcIn the end credits they say special thanks to UAE Armed Forces. I don't know how come Tom doesn't know but but UAE is one the world's biggest allies of Saudi Arabia and a brutal dictatorship whose leaders have killed for power, gotten away with murder and routinely abuse human and women's rights in brutal ways that the whole world sees and then turns away and says nothing. I don't blame Tom in anyway I just don't know what the UAE armed forces could have done besides try to blow up US and Israel that they got special thanks for in this movie. Never forget UAE was one of the countries that attacked US on 9/11 and got away with it. Well so that was a bit of a downer in what is one of the best movies of the year, decade, and of all time. Again no fault of Tom/Chris/crew/cast.Could have had more female nudity and sex. This would have made the movie better. Ferguson is great but you know female nudity and sex can really really make a scene and a movie great but this is an action movie. Just saying the movie could have been even better with this but they probably wanted a non R rated Mission movie the whole family could enjoy.Overall this is the best Mission movie so far and I really hope Tom delivers even better movies than this in the future. The way Tom ran and did all his other acting and stunts was truly mesmerizing.Tom's filmography truly is amazing and he excels in his role as producer and star of Mission films. He truly excels.Watch this movie because its truly a great entertainer.",

Tom Cruise is main focus of this movie and all of the other Mission Impossible movies. He is the driving awesome force that brings his enemies to their knees. And this movie is no different. Tom Cruise acting in this movie is strong and true to Ethan Hunt I'm past movies. And again Cruise does all his own stunts in the film and this blows the movie out of the water. This lets the camera not have to cut away or shake when action starts with Cruise. They don't have to hid the stunt doubles face because their is not stunt double just Cruise. This is the main selling point of the film and the main reason I went to see if. And it paid off. This movie is packed with some of the best action I have seen in years. Every single action scene felt strong and quick and fluid. Amazing action.Where the movie has some flaws is with the story. This is a generic save the world from terrorists plot we have seen a hundred times. The only thing that keeps it from becoming to stail though is the clever spy gadgets and tricks that are often used in the movie. This often add originality to an other wise unoriginal story. This sounds like a large gripe but for this movie it really isn't. Because of the amazing action and not worrying about politics and governments like most movies do these days. But just sticking to the action and Tom Cruise's adventure has Ethan Hunt, the movie keeps it fresh all the way through.Overall, Mission Impossible Fallout is great (8).

As someone who can name every single James Bond movie in order including the year each movie came out, let me tell you that MAN did Mission: Impossible Fallout raise the bar for not only 007 films but for every action film that will now come out after this movie.",

The story was very predictable. In fact the movie itself pokes fun at the fact that it's the same, old same old; close calls, ridiculous fight and chase scenes. Don't get me wrong, I love those and appreciate what the movies brings to the table action wise. My next complaint was that this one lacked the dramatic feel that the previews led you to believe it would conjure. The ominous music, dark foreshadowing and title displayed during the original trailer all led me to believe it would have a darker more desperate feel that I just never felt during the movie. Overall I did enjoy it however I would probably rank it 4th in my MI hierarchy.",

Love the background music, especially during the halo jump and Tom Cruise is a BADASS when he runs. However I have to admit one thing. It is a little bit slower during like halfway of the middle to the middle then it picks up the pace again. Plus the plot is a bit predictable. Rouge Nation however is full of surprises and flows much better then this one. Honestly this movie is good, don't know why people are hating on it, maybe there just used too the CGI slugfest in which case don't take there reviews seriously. Fallout, Rouge Nation and Ghost Protocol are pretty even within in each other and are all good. I have already watched this film 4 times to get a clear understanding of it.",

Comes with stunning camera work, a beautiful use of sound, and an intensity that had me gasping for air.

Moreover, Rebecaa Ferguson was totally wasted in this movie and also the WHITE WIDOW's love for ETHAN HUNNT was not explored seriously in the movie. \nThe old trick of FACE MASKING seems to be old enough for the audiences.\nMI:FALLOUT really misses the thrill and charisma of previous film like GHOST PROTOCOL.The director, Mr. Christopher McQuarrie, shuold stop spoiling this great series as he has done with JACK REACHER.\nINDEED a bad movies of the series.",

What started out as an auteur-driven James Bond has evolved into a consistent blockbuster factory. Starting with 2011's Ghost Protocol, Tom Cruise and his M:I filmmakers found a very satisfying formula for delivering summer thrills, and Fallout might be the best version yet. Don't expect anything revolutionary or new. That's not what this is about. What you will get is another up-tempo, dazzling rollercoaster full of beautiful people doing incredible things. You might poke holes in the plot or roll your eyes at some of the more predictable twists, but you'll still enjoy every minute of it. The craftsmanship is such that Chris McQuarrie and company managed to keep me on the edge of my seat during the climactic chase sequence even when I know damn well what the eventual outcome will be. They should keep making these for as long as Tom Cruise can still look good running.",

All the actors performed there character wonderfully.\nThe sound effect is top-notch; you can hear every tiny details of engineered sound system waving in the cinema hall.I really like the way that some comedy scenes were added in-between the action scenes. Specially the one in which Benji was directing Ethan to catch Walker and at one point Ethan had to jump out of the window, than Benji said \"What do you mean that you have to jump out of the window? Oh sorry, I was looking at the map in 2D\".NOW, let's not forget about stunts. All the stunts were real. They were choreographed in such a way that they really look genuine. I watched Mission Impossible - Fallout behind the scenes shots on YouTube and let me tell you 'Tom Cruise himself performed all his stunts'. He himself performed the HALO jump stunt from the plane and to complete that scene he had to jump from the plane more than 100 times (including the practice jumps). He jumps from one building to another by himself. And also lets not forget that he himself flew the helicopter. The straight mountain that he had to climb really reminded me the intro scene of Mission Impossible 2 where he has to climb the rock mountain.So, I will recommend you all to really watch Mission Impossible - Fallout in theatres.Now, in the end I just have to say it \"Ethan Hunt beat the crap out of Superman\".",

This movie would have been just another action flick without Cruise. Sure we have a stellar cast, but did not Mr. Cruise steal every scene? He is perfect in the role of Ethan Hunt, a spy whose whole team is rubbed out in a convoluted cover up at the start. It is up to Ethan to uncover the plot behind the failed mission. The movie is a series of unveiled plot twists that becomes implausible after a while. But that's not the fun behind Mission Impossible. The fun is watching the great action scenes with their suspenseful turns. So much so, we are willing to suspend disbelief to enjoy the ride. And to let ourselves be swept away by Mr. Cruise's undefinable quality to take us there.And the stunts are performed by Tom Cruise himself. The daring set pieces are well choreographed and acted in a way that looks real and genuine that puts most of this year's other action blockbuster movies to shame. Halo Jump-.One of the first stunt scenes in the film, it is not just another jump. In the film, Henry Cavill's August Walker and Cruise's Ethan Hunt get hit by a lightning bolt as they take the jump. Due to which Walker loses consciousness as well as his O2 cylinder. What transpires on screen next is heart-stopping, to say the least. And let me remind you all, it's no CGI but Tom Cruise. The toilet fight sequence will leave you spellbound. How I wish this scene was longer in length than it already was. To see Tom Cruise and Henry Cavill getting reciprocated by one man is oddly satisfying and hilarious to see. The paris chase scene-.Who doesn't love Tom Cruise on a bike? Give the man a bike and he'll give the best bike chase scene you have ever seen. This one is too thrilling to be real but Cruise cruises past the busy roads of Paris like a cakewalk.Director Christopher McQuarrie uses gliding camerawork and razor-sharp cutting to heighten the excitement of Hunt's improvisation, which results in a car-and-truck chase down the very narrow streets of Paris, followed by some white-knuckle motorcycle work by Cruise; his ride through a roundabout, seemingly sliding within inches of dozens of other vehicles, is truly terrifying.Helicopter Chase-In the climax of the film, Tom Cruise goes behind Henry Cavill in what turns out to be an edge of the seat chase sequence and probably the best chopper sequence seen in any film till date. And what makes it even better is that Tom Cruise learnt how to fly a chopper to bring authenticity to the scene. I can watch this film again just for this epic climactic sequence.Foot Chase-It's Tom Cruise and he is running, enough said. But what makes this scene iconic is the fact that he broke his ankle while filming this scene. This whole long sequence is one of the major highlights of the film and has been shot beautifully.Its a must watch.Don't miss it.My rating is 10/10. And don't waste your time reading this article, go and watch the movie as soon as you can. It's totally worth it.",

The framing and camera moves are perfect, close ups catching every look and line just right. The fight choreography and vehicle chase sequences are on par with Ronin, perhaps better. If this doesn't win awards for its editing I'll, I don't know what I'll do, it'll win; the cuts are sublime. The score and sound design make your heart leap and your mouth gasp. It's as if you're being played like an instrument.MI fans will love the story that weaves together elements of all of its predecessors. If you really want to get every drop out it, you'll go back and revise the first, third and fifth in the series, paying particular attention to the first.The casting is great. The banter between Cruise, Rhames and Peg is on point. Ferguson's return gets points but the standout this time around is Vanessa Kirby tipping her hat to Vanessa Redgrave.As a fan of the series (save the second), I went in with high expectations and I was not disappointed.

It's about the stunning set pieces. It's about the stunts. The gadgets.But more than that, it is about the fantastic direction and editing.Christopher McQuarrie has done an extraordinary job in directing the action that I have hope again that Hollywood can do action cinema right when produced properly.The editing was perfect, Eddie Hamilton (yes I had to look it up, yes I will pay more attention to great editors in future) ensures that you see all the action you want, unnecessary quick cuts that have been the bane of action movies in the past 10-15 years are not present.\nThe sense of adventure - and humour - are present in most scenes, as they should be of a movie of this type. Grizzled cynicism is all well and good, but it's good to see an action movie changing things up a bit.If you don't like Tom Cruise, then why are you reading this page? I can't say I'm fan of the man, so if you're bored and want to see a great action movie, get over yourself and go in with an open mind, the production is top tier and it delivers an old fashioned Hollywood action movie that we don't see often enough.",

I am very disappointed in this Mission Impossible. It's time to let it go. I would like to see him come back with the Mummy part 2 but I do hope they have a very good story to tell for him to act in a a rival for him to combat with his new face. I don't want it too end of being like Ghost Rider part 2. It was a very poor movie. I couldn't believe how they down graded Nicholas Cage to a dope addicted to combat being the Ghost Rider. They could have done a better story then that. I was so disappointed.

I am glad that I waited as the last helicopter scene was beyond my expectation and it was the best scene of the movie. Except these 2 action scene, there is nothing new. I understand if Tom Cruise'fan like this movie but Critics too? They will be loosing credibility if they keep rating this kind of movie this high rating.

It is quite apparent when you see him on a big screen, especially when he does all the actions that distort his face. Still, Ethan Hunt remains the manifestation of destiny in his movies. One thing I like about the MI series is that they keep the characters simple and charming. Nowadays all the superhero movies are digging into the \"dark side\" of their heroes, and with all the crap that Hunt's been through, he still has integrity and courage as he had 22 years ago. He doesn't kill innocent people. He's protective of his teammates. He never hesitates when it comes to the choice between good and evil. Not for one second. That's what makes the series shine. Of course he has nightmares, but when he wakes up he's always knows what he's doing. Another thing I like about Hunt is the way he treats women. Like equal. I'm not going to pull all the feminist stuff on action movies, but it's nice to have a handsome agent who doesn't sleeps with EVERY SINGLE pretty girl in the movie. That's not charisma, that's sex addict.",

At the end of the day the main selling points is the action and amazing scence that keep you in suspense. Quite honestly that's what draws me in. Plot holes don't matter and that's the joy of this franchise. It's mission impossible and the amount of crazy stuff that the characters do, means you don't worry about them. I've watched this film countless times and still love the plot, characters and stunts better each time. It's a film that gets better each time you watch it as you think of different reasons why each character did that. Overall a must watch \ud83d\ude04\ud83d\ude04",

I'm a big fan of the series, and MI:3 was always my favorite followed very closely by Ghost Protocol, but this one is better than both of those. They went all out on this one. Not sure how they can top this one, but I'm sure they probably will. If you like action blockbusters, just go see it. You won't be disappointed.",

I might not ramble on approximately Tom Cruise for too lengthy however as soon as again, he places on a first-rate performance. A lot of the stunts are awesome and I haven't any clue how the person does it, specially now being in his past due 50s. Some of those stunts are not possible to explain with words. There is a exceptional quantity of documentation of those stunts and they may be a must-watch to absolutely recognize the movie.

Maybe you will understand after some thing takes place which you understand it, however you could in no way without problems see it coming and it's far normally executed very well.In summary, \"Mission: Impossible - Fallout\" is a exceptional movie.

            "content": "The trailer was awesome, and I have been excited to see this for awhile. I am a big MI fan, and both Ghost Protocol and Rogue Nation exceeded my expectations. This film, while still enjoyable, was a bit of a disappointment in terms of the media hype and love fest that has gone on with the reviews of this film. A few years from now, we will look back and both Ghost Protocol and Rogue Nation will stand above this one.Most of the action scenes were great, the motorcycle chase scene especially. My main issue with this film, was the lack of authentic suspense. Everything just felt a little off, a little forced, a little predictable, a little manipulative. Cruise also seemed tired. He's getting old, which they did play into with the film, and that did work to a certain extent. It was a little sad to be honest. SPOILER: I also didn't like the way they used the Henry Cavil character. I thought he had good chemistry with Cruise, and I was disappointed that they turned him into a villain. I really think they got too cute and clever and missed out on that potential. I thought it would have given the MI franchise a chance to continue on with Cavil as well, and Cruise as a sort of mentor, but obviously that wasn't the plan. It really reminded me of the latest James Bond film, Spectre. Skyfall was amazing, and Spectre just couldn't really deliver in the way Skyfall did. It was still enjoyable, but just left me feeling a little bored and not satisfied.Fallout was still fun, just not nearly as good as all of the hype. Cruise definitely has his die hard fan core that are out in full force, but as I said, when some objectivity and perspective take hold over the coming years, this will not be the highest ranked MI movie as I've read more than one review state. I have a feeling this might be the end of MI for Cruise, but I wouldn't bet on it, as Cruise has that ability to transform as he ages. I just think he's at that age where high-octane action is in his rear view mirror.",

Henry has done a good job and glad Rebecca had good screen time in this she was really good in all the scenes in which she appears. Ving Rhames and Pegg too make their presence felt by having a amazing chemistry with Cruise. Alec and Angela too did their parts perfectly same goes to Vanessa Kirby (loved her accent and expressions). Basically not even a single character was wasted every one of them did a great job. For me apart from adrenaline action sequences my favourite scene was Julia meeting Ethan (for real). Story was pretty much condensed in a way to make sure it doesn't get diluted by cliched story line. Screenplay was tight...in fact very tight at times.

What did surprise me, however, was that this movie shows you what it means to really, really love someone. What surprised me was that there was a catch in my throat and tears in my eyes at this particular relationship. I cried, and that has never happened to me before in any MI movie. In spite of everything else, as spectacular as they all were, this is what I will remember the most from this film. And that is why, for me, it will always be the best film of this whole franchise.",

The IMF team is amazing and they have great chemistry as well as the new characters such as Walker, Sloan and White widow add so much authenticity and connections.

Would have been more effective to set him up as the bad guy and then have it be someone else. 2. There were times - and in a movie this length, a LOT of times - where it seemed that we were watching just one chase scene after another so that we could then watch another chase scene. They could have easily taken out 10 and maybe 15 minutes and gotten down to about a 2 hour run time and not diminished any other aspect of the picture.So pluses - technical brilliance and engaging characters - FAR outweigh minuses.

They're the different pieces of a pie which have a line between them even how hard they try to be together. In the contrary, Ilsa is the 2nd woman which is matter most in his life. And she has the same direction with Ethan, she can kill to save people, she can protect herself, she can do everything for her love so she and Ethan can stay together.\nOf course in the real life, there's no such thing like killing as this movie, but it's admittedly that to protect and maintain the love, we need to be in the same direction, need to be the best one of ourselves before become the best couple.

            "review_title": "A Sequence of Incredible Action Scenes Glued by Something That Attempts to Look like a Story",
            "content": "What had we known about \"Mission: Impossible 6\" before the production started? In February, 2017, Empire posted an article that shed some light on the movie. In his interview, Christopher McQuarrie revealed that the new film wouldn't start with an action scene and promised to go deep into Ethan Hunt's character. \"I've seen five of these movies and I don't know who Ethan Hunt is\" - McQuarrie said. Key phrases from his interview also include \"I want to know who Ethan is in this movie\" and \"It's a very different Ethan Hunt, I can promise you that\". In addition, McQuarrie teased the return of some old faces from the franchise (\"including people you would not expect to be back\") and hinted that the new movie would be more like a meaningful story with giant action scenes rather than a sequence of action scenes glued by something that struggles to look like a story.With these words said by the director of \"Rogue Nation\", the new movie was sold to me at that point and immediately became the most anticipated movie of 2018. Now let's see what we've got.STORYThe movie begins with Ethan's nightmare. As promised, not an action scene. Well, I wouldn't call this \"very unconventional\" as McQuarrie did, but the idea's accepted. Ethan still dreams of his former wife, which is perfectly understandable.What's next? Well, unfortunately, the story itself begins. \"Unfortunately\" because one of the first things it mentions is a guy capable of assembling three atomic bombs in seventy two hours or so. Come on, Christopher! I'm not an expert in nuclear weapons and I can't know whether it's possible or not, but the key point is that I don't believe. It sounds ridiculous to me and makes me chuckle at a point where I'm not supposed to.What happens next? Ethan saves his friends and loses the plutonium. Another option was to save the plutonium and lose the friends. Is this unexpected of Ethan? No. Of course, it is not. Thanks to the previous five movies, we already have a feeling of what kind of person Ethan is and this decision of his is not surprising. What would one normally expect after this? Yes, of course: Ethan's immediate dismissal, rigorous investigation of the incident, Ethan would probably go to prison for the rest of his life or, at a minimum, considering his previous striking achievements, would be sent to feed penguins somewhere in Alaska. What do we have instead? Actually, this doesn't really matter. No one cares about the story anymore because no one takes it seriously. No one can take seriously a movie that shows three or four people going after nuclear weapons threatening the humanity.Could there be a way out? Yes, of course. The director and the screenwriters had plenty of options. E.g., consider showing Ethan save the plutonium in that scene. At least, that could have been a complicated moral quandary indeed. You are screenwriters after all, think of something non-trivial!CHARACTERSEthan Hunt. Remember they promised us a very different Ethan Hunt? \"Ethan, that's not who we are!\" - said Luther. \"Maybe it's time to reconsider that!\" - Ethan replied. In trailers, they even showed us Ethan killing a policeman in Paris. This does create an intrigue but forget it. This all is just a deception aimed to increase your interest in the movie. The scenes are there but they don't mean it. In reality, we still see the same old Ethan we've seen before. On the bright side, it's a rare case when the expectations fail for the better. On the other hand, if we didn't know who Ethan is after watching the first five movies, we still don't know. There is nothing new about Ethan in this movie.Solomon Lane. His return in \"Fallout\" was highly anticipated, but ask me what his role in the movie is and the only thing I can tell you now is that he was the reason of an incredible action sequence in Paris. Everything else just wears off. This fact becomes particularly frustrating when I recall that Solomon Lane is the only villain in the \"Mission: Impossible\" series who gives me chills when I watch \"Rogue Nation\".Julia. That's where, in some sense, they succeeded. Of course, her appearance in New Zealand(crossed out) Kashmir looks artificial to me and her monologue at the end of the movie sounds like a prepared speech, but the authors wanted to finish her storyline and they did it. She's married again and she doesn't regret anything. I think that's all we might want to know about her.Finally, where is the return of an old character we didn't expect? Was it Julia? No, her appearance in the movie was spoiled in trailers. Was it Solomon Lane? No. Was it Max? No. Mentioning Max in the movie was pleasant but it's not a return. So who? Probably, it's no one. Just one more point on the list of failed expectations.DECEPTIONUnfortunately, how they showed Ethan in trailers is not the only deception involved here. It all began when, according to rumors, they filmed Ethan, Ilsa and the White Widow walking together in the club in Paris for the trailer. Filming something for a trailer only is cheating, no excuses can be accepted here.Also, recall the white screen and the Sun when they cut the wires at the end of the movie. The shots are aimed to create a brief impression that the bombs have exploded, but in fact it's nothing but one more cheap deception. Hope no one would even think of comparing this with the powerful (even though absolutely ridiculous from the rational point of view) ending of \"Rogue Nation\". There is nothing to compare.LOCATIONSThe locations are great but there is one major thing to mention. Showing the Norwegian Pulpit Rock, which is a known and quite recognizable tourist attraction, in Kashmir? Come on! There are lots of outstanding locations in the world, but geography matters! Can't just show whatever you want anywhere to create a good scene. If you wanted it, you should have brought your story there.STUNTSSo what's best about the movie? The stunts! The stunts are absolutely incredible and amazing! Especially when you have an idea of how they were filmed, it's hard to find words to describe how good they are.SUMMARYSo what do we have after all? We have the HALO jump followed by the incredible action sequence in Paris (everything they filmed in Paris is perfect!) followed by the foot chase in London and followed by the bombastic helicopter sequence filmed over picturesque landscape of New Zealand. This all is glued by a couple of dialogues and complementary scenes that struggle to form a story. The impression is that the authors started with a list of stunts and locations they wanted to show but failed to combine this all into a decent script.Although, to be honest, there is one more scene I like in this movie. It's the dialogue between Ethan and Ilsa before they leave Paris. It's nicely filmed, although it doesn't save the story by any means.",

This is particualr for the villains as well because they are actually really good, which is something most previous M.I films have struggled with in the past.As always, the action scenes are incredible, they are filmed and choreographed so well and they all feel tense and real, it looks like people are actually hitting eachother.

This film all in all would also have been much better as a stand-alone because this film is very similar to all the previous films in the franchise. I give this film a 7, would be better if the other films didn't exist",

            "content": "Well, when has not Ethan Hunt, not taken the challenge. When has be backed down nor leave a mean behind. The 6th installment of the MI franchise, you see Tom Cruise, single highhandedly revive this for a few more movies, I am sure. At 56, this man is dope, his dedication and commitment is unquestionable. He can call it quits for the money he has amazed throughout his illustrious career. Yet, he comes back on top and hard to give us one of the best movies in a long time. Tom, spend 16 hours a day to get his rotorcraft license in just 6 weeks and that impressive. You would see in a breathtaking final scene of some air action. The next was the Halo jump ( High altitude, low Opening) from an aircraft. This part of the movie was shot in UAE, where he had to jump off from 25,000 - 35,000 feet in the air, and by doing this he became the 1st actor to do this stunt. They had only one take each day, due to the time of natural light and a three minute window for the perfect shot. TC trained over 6 months to get this shot, impeccable.Jumping from building, running mad on the streets of France, mad driving, hand to hand combat, this movie is one fine take. The action sequences are tight and will keep you at the edge of your seat. The plot keeps you hooked onto each word and move as you cant expect what comes next. from mistaken identities, plots to subplots, rogue agent to face masking, Director and Producer Christopher McQuarie has done an excellent job.\n Ethan's mission, which he chose was to track down the Apostles, a crazy bunch of cronies who's plan to blow up three Nuclear bombs in 3 strategic locations, destrory a large part of humanity, to start again. Hunt needs to retrieve the nukes and stop the syndicate from doing so. Sounds simple but never in the day of the most prolific IMF agent, Hunt.\nThe movie sees Simon Pegg and Ving Rhames back together to add a lighter shade to the movie, a much needed break to catch your breath. Henry Cavill, dropped his superman drapes to take on a more darker role here, does massive justice to his screen time on the movie. He is buffed a bit from his last movies and does play a subtle antagonist towards late ( oops.. did I say that :) )\nI am predicting, the Fallout is going to break the bank and set many records for the franchise. The movie is such a fantastic take and you can watch it several times. The acting, screen play, locations, cast, the the limit these action scenes have gone into, all make it a winner. Yet, there will be many nay Sayers comparing this to Fast & The furious, James Bond, but forgetting they all are different pedigree of movies, so as MI. You, listen to your heart and go watch this movie. You will surely want to see it twice. Fallout is FANTASTIC!!!\n\" If anyone can do this when at 56 years old, what is keeping me back\" Suren",

I would probably forget about the mission until he sends me a reminder. I won't be able to keep it a secret as WhatsApp doesn't have a self destruct feature and if I would break the phone after reading the message, I would be destroying company property.I will quickly dress up, except it won't be quick as I won't find half of my things, such as matching shoes (happened to me very recently). After much kerfuffle, I would come down, hunt for my car keys and just as I will be stepping out of the door, my dog will insist that I give him a ride first. On my way, I will get late as someone will drive way below the speed limit in the fast lane and none of the drivers will give way or yield as my exit approaches. Finally when I reach, I won't be able to get in, as the reservation clerk would have screwed up the spelling of my name, and won't be able to find me on the guest list.When finally inside, I would very quickly get distracted by the single malts, down a few and chat to random people, totally forgetting about my assignment, until my super efficient secretary would call me and ask, \"Boss, did you get the password to prevent global annihilation as per the instructions?\" I will quickly, (okay drunkenly), swing (okay lumber) into action, locate the villain's girlfriend (or boyfriend), start seducing her (or him) and just as she (or he) would be about to give me the password under the influence of my irresistible charm, Monica would FaceTime me and ask, \"Where are you? When will you be back? Should I leave dinner on the table or would you eat out\"?And then bomb will detonate and the world would end.Luckily, the real Ethan Hunt has no such constraints. So he rides, drives, flies, kicks, punches and shoots his way through US, London, Paris and Kashmir, to give us what is the probably the best Mission Impossible movie to date. The plot is complicated enough to keep you interested for the slightly longish 2.5 hours and Tom Cruise, Simon Pegg and Ving Rhames are brilliant as usual. Sean Harris, even in a straightjacket, is menacing, and leather has never looked as good as it does on Rebecca Ferguson. The chase sequences are brilliantly shot, and since they don't have a background score, the roar of the motorcycle and the growl of the car gets the adrenaline pumping. The much talked about helicopter sequence lives up to the hype and Paris and London have never looked so exciting before this.I have only two gripes. One, the main villain is not threatening enough, He comes across the guy who will not only help you undress before, but also help you dress after the act (wink).The other, more serious one, is that I saw the movie in what is probably the most horrible location in Singapore. The wine was off, the chips were soggy, the beer was warm and it took me an hour to come out from the car park after the movie was over.So Mr Hunt, your mission, should you choose to accept it, is to drive out of the Vivocity car park in less than 24 hours, on a Sat night.This review will self destruct in...errrrr.....ummmmm....2 years?",

Its gonna be hard watching Fast & Furious and 007 movies now. I hope they can still entertain cause this one set the bar really high. At the same time it doesn't sacrifice its story, the plot twists are predictable but more like homages to previous movies.

And even then, there is no iconic setpiece (e.g. the Dubai tower, the Kremlin, the water cooling station in #5, etc.). It's a bit chatty (McQuarrie loves his dialogue) and plot heavy and doesn't have the gadgets or elaborate heist sequence we've come to expect at some point in every MI film.

It's easy to hate the bad guy, and for me it was a surprise to see, who the bad guy was. \nI loved how Tom Cruise managed it, to get Henry Cavill into the team and of course, Simon Pegg was the hero of the hearts - just as always.\nThere's only one thing I was sad about: William Brandt wasn't there. I know, it has something to do with Jeremy Renner and the fact, that he had to play in the Avengers instead.

Simon Pegg (Benji) Ving Rhames (Luther) and Rebecca Ferguson (Ilsa) are outstanding support actors to make up Ethan's team with Sean Harris (Solomon Lane) and Henry Cavill (Walker) terrific in their roles as the bad guys. Plus, adding Julia created that little edge to the mission for Ethan. I really admired the attitude of Ethan as he never gives up regardless of what happens, which makes quite an impression. I thought that the plot was really gripping, putting nuclear bombs in always raises the stakes and excitement. I thought the stunts and camera work were amazing too, especially with Cruise doing the stunts himself. I loved the camera shots during the Paris chase, the rooftop sprint through London and the final battle between Ethan and Walker, which I thought was a masterpiece. This film went to some lengths to get it right, McQuarrie amazing director. I would totally recommend this film if you haven't watched it already.",

            "content": "Found the first three films ones that had a lot to like (namely the action, the visuals, good casting on the whole and Philip Seymour Hoffmann's superb villain in the third) but also their faults (plot convolution in the first and third and the characters could have been written better in the second and third).\n\n'Ghost Protocool' to me was a great film and the best of the series since the original, and actually better than it, mainly because the story even though somewhat familiar seemed more focused and far less convoluted. 'Rogue Nation' was on 'Ghost Protocool's' very high level. Sure, there was a little bit of familiarity and the basic structure was somewhat formulaic, but 'Rogue Nation' had enough freshness and so much fast and furious excitement and thrills it doesn't feel like an issue.\n\nContrary to the critical consensus that 'Mission Impossible-Fallout' is the best 'Mission Impossible' film, personally don't quite agree. It is definitely one of the best ones, and perhaps third place behind 'Ghost Protocool' and 'Rogue Nation' (my personal favourite).\n\nIt does have a little too much going on in places and things get too complicated in spots. Ving Rhames is underused and doesn't seem to be enjoying himself in a basically nothing role.\n\nSome of the dialogue is also somewhat forced.\n\nVisually, 'Mission Impossible-Fallout' is even slicker and even more stylish than 'Ghost Protocool' and 'Rogue Nation', surpassing the latter as perhaps the most audacious of all six films put together. The locations, from sinister drabness to stunningly colourful, are a feast for the eye and the effect dazzle. The music doesn't overbear the action and such at all while making a pulsating impact thanks to the thrillingly authentic sound.\n\nThe action is bigger, bolder and more dynamic than any other action scenes seen before in the previous four instalments. Many are breath-taking in their excitement and also nuances, hard to pick a favourite with such spectacular stunts and action scenes between the lightning storm, the motorcycle chase, the helicopter battle, the car chase, the London sprints and the toilet martial arts fight. Christopher McQuarrie's directing is again some of the best he's ever done, with a great sense of visual style and a real grasp of the storytelling.\n\n'Mission Impossible-Fallout' script is generally sharp, knowingly sophisticated with the humour (not cheesy or out of place) and intrigue superbly balanced. The story, the series' heaviest, darkest and most ambitious, is told at a breakneck pace without being rushed and grips one right in and never lets go, with the backstories providing some depth. There is, like with 'Rogue Nation' an appealing light-heartedness, tongue-in-cheek and suspense of superior tension and elegance (as far as the 'Mission Impossible' films go).\n\nTom Cruise is very impressive, handling the stunts with effortless and enviable ease and acting with steely charisma. Rebecca Ferguson shows an even better and more confident knack for scene-stealing, with her in ersatz breath-of-fresh-air form. Sean Harris and Henry Cavill intimidate effectively, while Simon Pegg's comic relief in no way jars and is actually very funny and Jeremy Renner's presence is more than welcome. Vanessa Kirby, Alec Baldwin and Michelle Monaghan are also strong. It is a shame however that Ving Rhames is underused and lacking the charisma that he showed in 'Rogue Nation' despite being under-utilised in that too.\n\nOn the whole, very good, just not amazing. One of the better 'Mission Impossible' films though and among the better films of the year, if not among the very best. 8/10 Bethany Cox",

The music and sound effects were classic, appropriate and added to the scene without being overwhelmingly loud or distracting - no small feat! Also, I love the strong, powerful, badass women in this movie!",

Mission Impossible is the one of few movies I can think of that gets better and better with each part. It's almost unbelievable that the sixth sequel to any franchise looks this good and fresh. Interestingly, the director changed for each film in the series and this film is the first where the director team remained the same. The last three are very good, and this one is probably the best in terms of quality. An interesting story that requires attention, tense action scenes that are at the highest level. I must also mention Tom Cruise who is a masterful actor as well as an action star who participates in various stunts. Shooting, driving, racing, jumping, parkour, flying, the character did absolutely everything in a very tense film through his 140 minutes, which is not a small amount for an action film. one of the most appreciated things about Cruise is that what he does onscreen is real. He really does those leaps between buildings. (He broke his ankle on one of those leaps and shut down production for seven weeks.) He really does drive a motorcycle at high speeds against traffic. He really does fly a helicopter. Who knows what motivates this guy, but the results are incredible. The music, the stunts, the actors, the cities, and the landscapes. Everything was put together amazingly well. And an ending scene that you will never forget. And, some people may find the plot quite complicated, and it is. You really need to pay attention. I recommend watching MI5, and, if you have time, all the others. There is a reference to all of them along with the movie.",

Take this plot a man and his friends must stop a nuclear bomb and it comes down to him fighting for the denotator ! From 1980 until today there is at least 40 movies with this exact same plot absolutely no originality at all. Listen i like the cast but there was one person missing from the cast that every movie like this or a Bond movie has and that's the super hot spy either she is good or evil but in this film the ladies are pretty but none are a Bond girl. If you are going to take a lame plot like this you need the hot girl, you need weapons that we have never seen before, The mask thing is great but was under used in the one scene they used it and tricked the guy that was good. The audience should not know what's going to happen before it does and they did in this movie except for that. You want more of that you want them going i did not see that coming. The car chase and to long and lost the audience they got bored you need a wow factor for a chase to work today. I am not talking about crazy jumps etc.. for comic relief have a pet grooming truck open in the back and he drives in or pull into a strip joint and the strippers open a secret basement. They all would be better than these guys going 120 crashing the car and getting out and fighting a half a dozen guys. You want the audience to believe this could happen no one believes in these chases. Two helicopters go down and both guys in separate helicopters live come on. You new the moment they said the word detonator there was going to be a fight and he would stop it at the last minute. There was no suspense like i said you have seen this plot dozens of times before. Even with the technology we have today they could have made this exact movie in 1980 and it would have looked the same. To recap if you have no life like the guys who said this was the best then this movie is for you. If you want action, suspense, hot women, new gadgets and a brand new plot then this is not the movie for you. Honestly why do all these movies have to be a bomb or a chemical weapon ? Has anyone had a new idea in the last half a century ? You have a blank page you could have anything going on and they always fall back to these tired plots. Listen i love the cast they are great actors but no matter how good you are you can't take a plot that has been done a hundred times and make it seem new. If your being honest you saw everything coming before it even happened yes even the guy betraying him that was their wow factor for this movie. I could have paused it and said what was going to happen from the beginning to the end every 10 to 15 minute and i would have been exactly right every time. I know a lot of you new what the plot was and new half way thru what was going to happen. You new when they said they need the detonators he would have to fight him and with a second left turn it off i dare you to tell me you didn't. You know what i would have done i would have let it blown up and then had Ethan's twin brother come back in the next movie for revenge. You could have had some of the original cast not in the bomb radius but yes you would have to kill off a couple characters you know why ? No one would see it coming... Yes i am not saying do that exactly i am saying make a movie that is original or if you are going to take one of these over used plots totally change it put your spin on it make it so the audience has not got a clue what's going on. Let me rephrase that you want them to follow the story but every time they think this is going to happen something else happens keeping them on the edge of their seat. The only good thing about this movie if you had to go to the bathroom you didn't have any problem catching up to the plot. I meant no offense to the actors or the people who liked it i liked this movie 40 years ago i just wanted something new.",

No realistic plot and chase scenes lets be honest about chase scenes i don't care if its a car, a motor cycle, a boat, a helicopter etc.. They are all to long.... instead of building of the action they end up boring the majority of the audience. Just once i would like to see a realistic crash all of them are so out there no one believes they would survive let alone walk out and 9 times out of ten get in a fist fight ! The whole point is to make the audience believe this is real when a guy crashes two helicopters and both survive never going to happen in real life. A guy crashes a car going 120 miles and hour he is not getting out with a few scratches and fighting a half a dozen people. Anytime i see this type of stuff i know they are trying to make up for bad writing. My bottom line is if your bored this movie is a bleah something to watch. Oh the other thing that has been done to many times it's time to come up with something new. The timer is going off there is under 5 minutes left on the timer and of course there is a fist fight and the actual time for the fight is longer than the time that was on the timer and of course they always get the timer and turn it off. Honestly you could take the plot of this movie punch it into google and dozens of films will come up with the exact same plot and outcome there is no originality. To recap don't expect a Bond movie no original plot, no super hot women, no exciting and crazy hand guns and other weapons nope this movie could have been made in 1980 and they would have to change nothing.",

This one seemed kind of bland by comparison. A lot of the action scenes seemed like repeats of things that have been done many times before and the ending scenes especially seemed a bit forced to create extra drama. Some of the characters that seemed quirky or engaging in the previous movie were a bit more bland in this one. In this story, the team is supposed to get some rogue plutonium. When it is stolen from under their noses, they spend the rest of the movie trying to get it back. The plot is a bit confusing and implausible at times to the point that you don't end up getting very invested in everything that is going on. Towards the end, there is an odd addition of a storyline about a love interest from Ethan's past that seems a bit tacked on. Overall, this edition of Mission Impossible is not as engaging as some of the others have been. It is enough to be entertaining for a couple hours of viewing, but it probably will not be considered a classic.",

            "content": "I recently watched the 2 latest offerings in the Mission Impossible franchise and for me at least, I think Rogue Nation is the superior movie. It's not by much, but Fallout feels a little predictable, even by the low standards of popcorn fare like this.\nFrom the opening HALO jump there are certain scenes which feel heavily edited as they seem to have parts of dialogue missing: characters suddenly become adversarial with zero build up, wooden expressions on actor's faces appear as if they're reacting to something we haven't seen/heard, and so on (I hadn't realised how bad an actor Tom Cruise can be until I watched these movies. He's very charming and charismatic and does action well enough, but he can't sell drama or emotion to save his frequently in peril life). There are also new characters introduced who simply dilute things and add nothing. The story would work better without them and it feels like a clumsy attempt to interject characters simply so they could be used in future movies.\nAs for the storyline, it's convoluted yet somehow predictably simple. Fallout is best viewed with Rogue Nation fresh in your mind as they do try to connect a lot of story threads  and it feels like a continuation of RN's story, not simply a standalone movie (so people who haven't seen RN won't appreciate a good portion of character motivations and where the big threat has come from). The villain of the movie is very under-served and comes off as more bland than threatening, though that may be more to do with how much screen time he's given, which is surprisingly little considering how big of a villain he's supposed to be. By the end we're seemingly left to assume the good guys have won, but you get the impression that the big threat, The Syndicate, would surely carry on as any time they're mentioned we see a screen full of at least 50 rogue agents, yet by this movie's end we've met less of them than you can count on one hand... And as for the twist of who the traitor might be? Well, it's as telegraphed as it could possibly be. There's really only one choice of who it could be right from the start, so as soon as you make your guess, you're almost guaranteed to be right (because nobody believes it's ever actually going to be ultimate good guy, Ethan, do they?).\nThe stunt work is as impressive as ever, but it gets a little tired. The helicopter chase at the end outstayed it's welcome for me and I thought it would have been better-served to be shorter than it was. With so many tense set pieces it's easy to overplay that hand, which this movie does. Perhaps some clever gadgets used in some situations would be an entertaining diversion from the bull in a China shop approach of trying to one-up themselves with every big set piece?\n\nI'm definitely on board for the next movie as these feel like golden era James Bond movies, made today. They wisely don't move too far into the gritty realism that The Bourne Identity injected into these spy action/thrillers, and rely more on bouncy interactions, big action set pieces and banter. Suspension of disbelief is paramount when watching these movies, but rated for what they are they're entertaining distractions. And isn't that their purpose? Don't expect much and they probably won't disappoint you.",

There's a wonderful mix of both practical and special effects which flow so seamlessly even the most eagle-eyed cinephile will struggle to spot a green screen.

It has a spectacular cast, everyone plays a good role, a soundtrack that makes your hair stand on end and a tension during the incredible film, I had to sigh many times during the film, because I was nervous, I insist, a spectacular direction,  An incredible role of Tom Cruise, is that it is not the same role as we always see an Ethan Hunt with feelings, who is not a typical hero, but an authentic hero who would die for his companions and for saving the world.  An incredible Henry Cavill, as you can see he knows how to fight.  A very good story, with very good twists.  Some very good visual effects, CGI is never abused and a spectacular bad one too.",

Tom Cruise did a great job, and most of the acting was ok, but it is so cliche, so generic, so recycled, so predictable and boring in the worst way, it reminds me of a bad TV show that wants to be the \"cool-hip dude\" at the party. It is Badly paced, and everything but the kitchen sink was thrown into this film. If this is the first film you've ever seen, you might like it, but never love it. \nThe Worst thing about this movie is that everybody walks around in this action-hero Daze and it is Ridiculous. running around without masks, having no backup, going in with 3 guys and a fancy briefcase do Not justify great story and action. It also tried to \"copy\" the terrible scene in Batman when All the cops got stuck in the sewers and didn't even try to get out. Awful.\nthis movie was a decade late and a dollar too much.

Which is to say, it is every bit as excellent, it is the quintessential action blockbuster of these few years. It is the pinnacle of the franchise; gripping, brisk, accessible and clever. Everything in my previous review stands verbatim. This is an excellently entertaining flick with everything firing in all cylinders against all odds. \nIt is a better film in every way than its predecessor. It carries its own unique voice despite being the same director as the last film. An action blockbuster is inherently flawed and so it must mask its flaws and perform greater, smarter feats to obfuscate and override its flaws and, like The Dark Knight before it, Fallout manages to do so.\nIt's running in clean, renewable creativity. \nImpossible Mission: You want me to say the Halo jump but while I find its addition into the picture to be pleasingly and shockingly sudden, the use of a CGI backdrop (storm) downplays the reality of it for me. Fallout may be the first in the franchise to have such forward momentum, thrust and its own blistering finale to catch up to, that it forgoes the trope of the big central mission. At a push I'd say the finale is exercised like a team mission, with everybody doing their part, a welcome addition of Monaghan's Julia, and IMAX footage of Cavill shooting a LMG at Tom Cruise flying a helicopter for real. It saved the best till last. \nRoll on Mission: Impossible 7 and \u221e\nAn additional shoutout is needed for Lorne Balfe who managed to create an evocative and memorable score using the bongos from the first film, with a brilliant epic update to the theme, and like David Arnold's work in Casino Royale, also creates a new exciting theme, hopefully for all the rest of Mission. \nAnd in regards to the editing of the IMAX ratio shifts into the movie, I only noticed twice towards the end of the movie and couldn't believe how seamless and effective it was when compared to the eyesplitting nausea of something like the latest Transformers.",

Tom Cruise, what can I say about the man, he is unbeatable in the stunt department and he gives a really dedicated performance as well, I loved seeing him reunite with Julia and moving on from what happened to her, I can really feel the struggle inside of him and thought that this outing as Ethan Hunt, was perhaps the best of the series. Ving Rhames is funny, and still has that great fatherlike relationship with Ethan that is so heartwarming to experience. Simon Pegg gives a great performance as always, he is really committed to being Benji and clearly wants to stay on the team, I love Pegg so much and think that he is very underrated as an actor, and I definitely prefer him in this then in Star Trek, not that he was bad in it, he is just so incredibly good in this. Rebecca Ferguson was great once again, but I felt that she was a bit better in Rogue Nation, she doesn't get quite as much to do this time around, but it was nice to see her return. Michelle Monaghan had a most welcome return that felt necessary to Ethan's progression as a character, she is probably done with the series so it was nice to see her character arc, that was started excellently in M:i-III, finished in a satisfying way. Alec Baldwin was also great to see return, though his role was significantly reduced and ultimately, terminated, I thought that his sacrifice felt earned and it contributed to the plot pretty well, I couldn't ask for anything more from Baldwin's character, he was about as good as he could have possibly been, I'm just sad to see him leave so soon. Sean Harris returns as the main villain of this movie and he is super good, I liked him in Rogue Nation, but he was so much more present and developed in this film, I definitely didn't mind seeing him return and enjoyed seeing him in a couple great action sequences as well. Henry Cavill is underrated in my opinion and he gives a great performance here; for the first half of the film, he basically fills in the gap that was left with Jeremy Renner's absence, but then in the second half he becomes Sean Harris's right-hand man, I really bought into him as a villain and thought that he was really very physically imposing, he did a great job with what he had to work with. Vanessa Kirby was the disposable character of this movie, I really didn't see the point of her character when her brother basically did everything for her. Angela Bassett was basically Laurence Fishburne from M:i-III, she is in this movie for maybe 10 minutes, but she wasn't bad. The plot of this movie is great, but the in-between parts get very confusing, don't get me wrong, Christopher Mcquarrie wrote an excellent script, but it got confusing when multiple people all betray someone differently, I legitimately got confused for a couple of minutes, but it worked itself out by the end. It is still the best script in the series and I love how emotional it ties in with the characters, it was just complex and thought-provoking like the first film, but in an amazing way that challenges the audience. The helicopter chase sequence is the staple of the entire franchise, I was so invested and excited by literally every second it was happening, the camera angles were all perfect, the music added to the intensity of the situation and the minigun that Henry Cavill uses is so epic, I wanted it to never end. This is one of those super rare gems that tops what you thought could never be topped in terms of action sequences, stunts, and a great sense of teamwork. This probably my favorite team out of all of the movies, they whittled it down to only the very best and I hope to see them in the next two movies as well. The subplots could use a little more polishing and Vanessa Kirby's character could've been scrapped, but other than that, I was blown away by what this movie has achieved. This movie moved fast and slow and it achieved that balance of perfect pace that is so rare to see nowadays and it is accompanied by a super compelling script and mind-blowing action sequences, both helmed masterfully by Christopher Mcquarrie. This also has the best third act in any action movie ever, it is genuinely intense and also immensely entertaining, it leaves an amazing taste in your mouth for a while after it ends. This will be hard to ever top but I have been proven wrong in that department before, even just within this series, I only hope that I will be proven wrong again.",

Ever since Mission Impossible 3 these films just keep getting better and better. They've even done the impossible by turning me into a Tom Cruise fan. I never liked the guy (even in his 80s prime), but seeing how far he pushes himself with the stunts in these movies is part of what makes them work so well. In a time when the action genre is filled with nothing but CGI and green screen, seeing Cruise go full Jackie Chan for these films deserves some admiration. The icing on the cake is that we're once again treated to a smart script, great supporting cast, plenty of surprises, and an infectious sense of fun. Although if you haven't seen the previous Mission Impossible, Rogue Nation, you might be a little lost, as this is the first entry in the series that isn't a standalone film. I never thought I'd see the day when I'd be enjoying this franchise more than Bond or Bourne, but here we are.

The intense action was cranked up to 100%, making sure to leave nothing unscathed by the chaos that is left in the trail. While the movie was overall immensely predictable, the plot was still solid and the storyline was still immensely entertaining. The acting was as awesome as usual, both from returning cast members and new ones, adding in great emotion to all of the characters, which would've otherwise been rendered as two-dimensional within a dumb action movie. The characters themselves were well written, allowing for a great variety of different personalities to intermingle and add a greater depth within the film, making it feel sophisticated and emotionally realistic. The tone of the film was great, allowing for the film to be mainly intense with leg-room for some comedic moments. What also made this film really great was that it is the first sequel in the franchise to have more of a direct continuation from a previous storyline, instead of just sticking with the James Bond pattern of independent adventures with recurring characters in each film. Overall, this film was really well done. It was the most action-packed and explosive installment by far while managing to remain emotionally complex and well-acted, even if the plot line was predictable.",

An irritatingly predictable plot with a cast that constantly seemed to be on the brink of boring themselves to death on set.\n\nTo summarize the acting and really the movie altogether - I offer the following formula for your consideration:\n1) *literally any predictable event/revelation that the writers/producers think they invented to completely obliterate the audience's preconceived notions of modern cinema*\n2) *every single character the audience is expected to root for not breaking a single sweat in their 'acting' arsenal during the build up to this 'mind-altering' revelation*\n3) *the most agonizingly obviously outcome to previously mentioned event/revelation*\n4) (every single character the audience is expected to root for) \"Oh, are you, the audience, surprised by *insert event/revelation*? I, on the other hand, remain unfazed by this *insert event/revelation* because I had known all along that this would ultimately be the outcome. In fact - all of those actions you saw leading up to this *insert event/revelation* that were somehow both incredibly predictable yet statistically improbable to foresee were all part of my/our premeditated plan that resulted in this exact outcome.\"\n5) (every single character the audience is expected to root against) *also audibly unvexed and bored* \"I will now try my absolute best to act surprised while simultaneously launching my extremely specific counter-attack that I had obviously devised in advance for this exact scenario.\"",

This is what you come for, not a deep story or in-depth character development. You want to see Tom Cruise run really fast and jump off of tall things. While the action falls just short of the quality from the third film, it still packs a hard punch.\n\nGenre: 9\nIt is surprising to me that, after six films and the following of a somewhat similar formula along the way, this franchise still continues to stand at the pinnacle of espionage action films. Director Christopher McQuarrie not only manages to keep the action fresh in Fallout, but he makes you think they could easily pull off another three. Not the best M:I movie, but it takes you on a wild ride nonetheless.\n\nMemorability: 9\n\nPace: 9\n\nPlot: 9\n\nResolution: 9\nWasn't perfect, but solid enough to wrap the film up nicely. I was hoping for a little more for Ethan, but something tells me that things are going to work out for him just fine in the end. You will definitely leave the movie excited from the seventh installment.\n\nOverall: 91\nMission: Impossible\u2014Fallout is clever enough to make you use your brain, but not too over-the-top where you're left thinking, \"Wait, what?\" I have mad respect for McQuarrie as it's hard as all get out to keep a franchise fresh. After a terrible second try, the franchise has been balling ever since. Long live the running of Tom Cruise!",

Knowing that Tom Cruise (Ethan Hunt) does his own stunts adds a level of danger while you're watching it. Whether he's scaling a rope hanging from a helicopter or legitimately flying that same helicopter, he's great and it's tense. Bringing back Sean Harris (Solomon Lane) was brilliant. It really makes this feel like a sequel to the last one and he is a great villain. His voice is menacing and he's smart enough to be a true threat. Adding Henry Cavill (August Walker) was also genius. He brought an imposing physical rival. Combine him with Lane and you've got a formidable antagonist team. The work done by the IMF team is again fun and their interplay continues to be a highlight of the series. I loved Rebecca Ferguson (Ilsa Faust) almost as much in this one as the previous installment. There are some thrilling moments and great twists peppered in throughout this, as well as some fights that will leave you breathless. Also, love needs to be shown to the score. They make the best use of the iconic Mission Impossible theme during one particular scene.\n\nWeaknesses: Though I liked Cavill's performance and the idea behind his character, there were issues. He gets some awful lines of dialogue and the movie kind of spoiled his villainous side through the trailer. That took a lot away from the moment. I do feel this is a bit too long and it drags at a few points.\n\nOverall: The best installment of the franchise. Huge action, good acting, a solid score, and edge of your seat thrills.",

His support team is back with Ving Rhames, Simon Pegg, and Rebecca Ferguson. Christopher McQuarrie teams up with Cruise for another adrenaline pumping entry into the expanding Mission Impossible franchise.\n\nEthan is soon reminded of his past when he is shown a picture of his deceased wife which is poignant if you have been familiar with her presence in past movies. He is an unstoppable force attempting to keep the world safe completing one mission at a time. However, he has his limits and it still haunts him how it turned out with his wife. The theme of trying to let go of the past but not being able to will repeat itself throughout the picture.\n \nHis trust is only placed in his circle of associates and understandably so given how he has been betrayed in the past. The story starts to really take off when Ethan and his associates have to deal with the repercussions of a failed mission. Henry Cavill makes his presence as another agent who disagrees with Ethan's methods scrutinizing most of his moves. This film tries to show Ethan as more flawed starting to struggle with his age and not an unbreakable machine. There is some success and the picture of his wife clearly affects him piercing a seemingly impenetrable emotional armor.\n\nThe movie fails when it shows his wife later in the film as the scene is poorly constructed and we do not get a real satisfying payoff for what the characters went through. This felt rushed so we can get back to the world saving events and the tension of a short amount of time to accomplish the mission. Stakes are incredibly high but it never feels possible Ethan will fail despite the enormous odds. It would be difficult for the movie to go into another direction and Cruise is the driving force behind these films. But they could have played more with Ethan's character and made it feel he was in real danger. The confines of continuing the franchise prevents the film from taking any real risks with advancing a more interesting narrative.\n \nThe motivations of characters are not explored very well with them changing their allegiance or showing their true colors so readily. Cavill and other characters present in the film could have been more intriguing with more development. Development suffers at the hands of spectacle and unfolding, spectacular action set pieces. Action sequences are enthralling and help to keep the frenetic pace. We are also treated to Cruise performing extraordinary stunts and over the top choreography.\n\nThe best action movies have healthy doses of incredible choreography but they also have characters worth caring about under the stress they are placed under. This picture suffers under the weight of continuing a highly successful franchise. Maybe, it is the reminder of the world needing saving again but this has been done too often with smaller stakes being more welcome. The tension build up just needed to have different methods rather than regurgitated methods such as a countdown on bombs.\n \nEthan is still an unstoppable force and this makes it difficult to relate to him. A problem lies with the movie feeling like just another entry in the franchise when it could use a different take where maybe Ethan is not the protagonist. Still, the movie is a lot of fun and the action is something to behold even if the story feels more of the same. I will always watch each entry with an eye for the action but hoping the franchise decides to take a risk or two with subsequent movies.",

            "content": "Spoiler alerts\nMission: Impossible \u00e2\" Fallout is a 2018 action spy film movie written, directed and produced by Christopher McQuarrie. It is the sixth film in the Mission: Impossible series. The movie is a direct sequel to Mission: Impossible \u00e2\" Rogue Nation (2015). The movie stars Tom Cruise, Simon Pegg, Rebecca Ferguson, Sean Harris, Alec Baldwin, Vanessa Kirby & Henry Cavill. \nThis time around the CIA is forced to work with the Impossible Mission Force (IMF), still led by Ethan Hunt (Cruise), to recapture arch villain Solomon Lane played by Sean Harris, to stop a disaster of epic proportions. CIA worker August Walker is played by Henry Cavill, who is new to the series.\nI really liked this film because the action is jaw dropping. It's got a great cast and a runtime of 147 minutes which was just right. We see Cruise doing new stunts we have never seen before. In one amazing scene we see Walker and Hunt parachute out of aeroplane into a thunderstorm. Cruise was so dedicated to doing a good job that he injured himself filming an action scene that went wrong. In jumping from one building to another he broke his ankle and the movie had to be put on hold for 3-4 months.  Henry Cavill makes an excellent good guy/bad guy character which is a change from him playing Superman.\nAt times this film was a bit confusing. For instance, the scene where you see Benji Dunn (Simon Pegg) wearing Solomon Lane's mask. Annoyingly, the trailer shows a thrilling scene of a helicopter spinning out of control and nearly hitting a truck however, that scene didn't make the final cut of the film!  I think this movie is good action flick, but the director left out interesting scenes.",

This film allows Tom Cruise to show his acting chops more better than any of these since the first MI film. Rogue Nation was already a fantastic movie that made me pay attention toChristopher McQuarrie, but this one shows he may be one of the best action directors out there. The only flaw I can think of is that Henry Cavill's line delivery is very slightly cheesy at times, but that is really nitpicking. Everyone else gives basically flawless performances. Even though Jeremy Renner was great in Rogue Nation, you forget about the fact he is missing from this one, interestingly. I do hope he returns in the future, though.",

            "content": "Two years after Solomon Lane's (Sean Harris) capture, the remnants of his organization, The Syndicate, have reorganized as a rogue terrorist group called the Apostles. IMF agent Ethan Hunt (Tom Cruise) is assigned to buy three stolen plutonium cores in Berlin from Eastern European gangsters before the Apostles can. He is joined by Benji Dunn (Simon Pegg) and Luther Stickell (Ving Rhames) for the mission, but the team fails when Stickell is taken hostage and Hunt's attempt to save him allows the Apostles to make off with the plutonium. The team later captures nuclear weapons expert Nils Delbruuk, who designed nuclear devices for an extremist named John Lark. They confirm that Lark hired the Apostles in order to find Lane. Furious at the IMF's failure to secure the plutonium, CIA Director Erica Sloane (Angela Bassett) instructs Special Activities Division operative August Walker (Henry Cavill) to shadow Hunt as he attempts to retrieve the plutonium...\n\nRotten Tomatoes critical consensus reads, \"Fast, sleek, and fun, Mission: Impossible\" Fallout lives up to the \"impossible\" part of its name by setting yet another high mark for insane set pieces in a franchise full of them.\" Variety's Peter Debruge called the film the series's most exciting installment to date, saying, \"McQuarrie clearly believes in creating coherent set pieces: His combat scenes are tense, muscular, and clean, shot and edited in such a way that the spatial geography makes sense.\" Entertainment Weekly's Chris Nashawaty gave the film an \"A\" grade, commenting on Cruise that \"He's still Hollywood's hungriest movie star\", with the series getting \"better, twistier and more deliriously fun with each installment\". George Simpson of The Express complimented \"the action is brutal and gut-punching, the pacing heart-pumping and the stakes so high it's gasp-inducing at times,\" adding, \"Fallout is an improvement on all the previous films' failings, drawing together all the best aspects of them; simultaneously giving off that classic vibe of the original while never being afraid to continually evolve;\" he gave the film five out of five stars. The Telegraph's Tim Robey summed up the film as \"spectacular and eye-popping,\" deeming it \"the blockbuster of the summer\" with \"a pleasingly sinuous plot,\" and calling the film and its series a \"Bond-like franchise\"; he also rated the film five out of five stars. \n\nWith the \"Mission: Impossible\" franchise Tom Cruise has created a Bond like legacy that keeps on going and you keep on wishing for more. Since the first one all the way back to 1996, these six films have been of different standards, but yet really entertaining from several point of views. Personally I really liked \"Mission: Impossible\", \"Mission: Impossible - Ghost Protocol\" and \"Mission: Impossible - Rogue Nation\". With \"Mission: Impossible - Fallout\" Cruise takes us further on to fantastic near-exhausting action/stunt sequences that is just out of this world, but I think that this is not the best film storywise in the series. Director Christopher McQuarrie who wrote the script as well did not manage to keep it fully together in my opinion, but his direction does. Tom Cruise is in true action mode for sure, so much that he broke his ankle during the shoot and I do think that Henry Cavills Special Activities Division operative August Walker is a good bad guy with a moustache and the driving force of a terminator. I loved MI6 agent Ilsa Faust (our Swedish pride Rebecca Ferguson) in Mission: Impossible - Rogue Nation, so I was happy to re-see her in this film. She just rocks! \"Mission: Impossible - Fallout\" is not bad, but not as good as I hoped when I saw the first trailers. \n\nTrivia: In August 2017, Tom Cruise suffered an injury while filming a stunt jumping from one building to another. He was able to grab onto the other buildingthanks to a harness strapped onto him and his history of performing his own stunts for action films, but his ankle fractured upon the impact of the jump. Cruise then got up and attempted to run it off, which was what the scene called for, before he and the crew decided to stop filming. Shooting was delayed for eight weeks following the injury, but the footage of the stunt used in the film and its trailers just so happened to be the actual injury.\n\nIt was announced by Cruise on January 14, 2019 that the seventh and eighth Mission: Impossible films will be shot back-to-back with McQuarrie writing and directing both films for July 23, 2021 and August 5, 2022 release. In February 2019, Ferguson confirmed her return for the seventh installment.",

Mission Impossible, Fallout. I thought that the story line was very good. It kept me interested throughout the whole film , even though I have never seen any of the previous films the story line in the film was easy to get a hold of and allowed me to get to grips with what is happening . The use of sound effects made the film seem very intense and realistic to what you was watching. The use of different camera angles and clever editing made the film much very gripping on its own. There is not a boring moment throughout the whole film. \n\nThe mise en scene in the film has a wide range of differences. For example, some parts of the movie are set in major capitals of the world such as London and Paris but towards the end of the film, in the helicopter fight scene , it is set within the outskirts of China, within the snowy mountains. The costume worn within the film make it easy to know who is who , for example Ethan Hunt ,played by Tom Cruise, is shown wearing a suit at the start of the film so we know he is an important character to the story. Also the suit hints that he may be James Bond style character, which we soon find out he is.",

It really feels like we are living in a solid era for action franchises with the Raid, John Wick, MI and even the Fast and Furious for our b-movie action goodness. We live in exploding times!\n\nHonestly, I don't think I have seen an action movie/spy game thriller that was this much fun in a while. Everything they did in this film was top notch. From the stunts to the chase sequence, to the amazing Helicopter chase...I mean damn. Also, if Cavill not being Superman anymore means we can see him as the beast he was in this movie, with an equally as beast mode a mustache, then I am all good with that. There are a few nitpicks, I thought that the movie dragged a bit between the middle and the end, I also had a few moments when I wasn't exactly convinced with Cruises acting, but nothing that really took me out of the film. Also while there was a spy story as always with this franchise, it still relies on the stunts and action to do the heavy lifting. Which isn't bad, when the action you have is this good. \n\nMI: Fallout is very good. One of the better action films of the last while. Easily deserving of the praise it has gotten and making me wish I had seen it a lot sooner.",

Cruise once again brings us insane stunt work and some of these will have you looking away. You have to give it to him, he can really entertain. This sequel is a great follow-up to Rogue Nation, a direct sequel and it delivers on the action, but not a good ending. I was hoping they might return to a more espionage style film for the sequels, but that won't be the case with McQuarrie.

Tom Cruise doing his own stunts adds a lot to the intensity of the movie. It's not a bad movie. It's not quite as good as people are making it out to be though. This is a slightly toned-down version of previous MI movies that were just way too over-the-top. This movie has more heart, and they actually pause the action every once in a while to have real, meaningful dialogue. I still feel like the characters involved were underdeveloped, but they're at least going in the right direction. It still feels like there's a little too much going on. Ilsa seems like she's just thrown in there to be the \"powerful\" female character who can do no wrong and who never loses. Oh wait, she does a couple times, but she's just fine after that (from being hit by a car to just killing everyone). It's kind of ridiculous and borderline... wait for it... MARY SUE-ish... There's a strange moment in the movie where Ilsa suddenly joins up with them, and it's never really explained because the scene before she's hiding in the shadows and randomly shooting guys, and then in the next scene she hops into a truck with them without anyone saying anything. Kinda strange. They toned down the feminist bull crap, but it's still there. For that reason it doesn't feel quite as real or intense. But it's a movie. *sigh* We're so starved for good films that it seems we'll freak out over anything even remotely good these days. It's an improvement, but this is no classic. It's just good. Not great. Don't get your hopes too high.",

            "content": "Mission Impossible: Fallout\n(2018)\n\nPlot:\nSame missions are not a choice. On a dangerous assignment to recover stolen plutonium, Ethan Hunt (Tom Cruise) chooses to save his team over completing the mission, allowing nuclear weapons to fall into the hands of a deadly network of highly-skilled operatives intent on destroying civilisation. Now, with the world at risk, Ethan and his IMF team (Simon Pegg, Ving Rhames, Rebecca Ferguson) are forced to become reluctant partners with a hard-hitting CIA agent (Henry Cavill) as they race against time to stop the nuclear fallout.\n\nReview:\nAlthough the action scenes are top class, and the stunts are amazing, this movie just seemed like another Tom Cruise action film to me. The storyline was half decent, even though the director overcomplicated it with technical jargon, and it was good to see the original cast back. After watching the bonus material, I don't think you can appreciate the work that goes into making one of these movies, especially with Cruise doing most of the stunts, and the director could have easily used a green screen for a lot of the locations, which he decided against. My problem with the film is the fact that it's not that different from the rest of the Mision Possible movies. It's just Cruise pushing the bar when it comes to the various stunts, including learning to fly a helicopter for this film. Don't get me wrong, it's still worth a watch if you're into your epic action films but I'm personally getting a bit fed up with Cruise running, jumping, and driving every vehicle made. After his amazing performance in Tropic Thunder, which a lot of people rated him for, I think it's about time Cruise stopped saving the day, against all odds. Anyway, two years after Solomon Lane's (Sean Harris) capture, the remnants of his organisation, The Syndicate, have reorganised as a rogue terrorist group called the Apostles. IMF agent Ethan Hunt (Tom Cruise) is assigned to buy three stolen plutonium cores in Berlin before the Apostles can. He is joined by Benji Dunn (Simon Pegg) and Luther Stickell (Ving Rhames) for the mission, but the team fails when Luther is taken hostage and Ethan's attempt to save him allows the Apostles to make off with the plutonium. Furious at IMF's failure to secure the plutonium, CIA Director Erica Sloane (Angela Bassett) instructs Special Activities Division operative August Walker (Henry Cavill) to shadow Ethan, as he attempts to retrieve the plutonium. I think you can guess where the movie goes from here! Basically, Ethan and his team go through hell to try and retrieve the plutonium, which they lost at the beginning of the film. With the help of MI6 agent IIsa Faust (Rebecca Ferguson), who saves Ethan's life a few times during the movie, their information finally leads them to a medical camp in Kashmir, were Ethan's estranged wife Julia (Michelle Monaghan) is working. The team deduces that Solomon and August are actually working together and that they plan to detonate the nuclear weapons over the Siachen Glacier, contaminating the water supply of Pakistan, India and China, with a third of its population affected, the world will descend into anarchy from which Solomon and August hope a new world order will emerge. Now you know why I said that the director overcomplicated the plot! Basically, some nutter wants to blow up half the world, so Ethan and his team have to stop him. Personally, I thought that there were way too many characters in the film, and the action went on forever. You can see where every penny of the budget went, especially as they shot in real locations but I would have liked more character building, and some wit to lighten the mood. It is non-stop from the beginning to the end which, in some ways, becomes a bit claustrophobic after a while. We all know that Ethan is going to save the day, once again, and after many years of saving the world, the stupid CIA Director still thought that he went rogue, which I thought was ridiculous. Anyway, I think that Tom Cruise has done every stunt known to man by now, so I think it's time for him to hang up his \"adrenaline junkie\" shoes, and try something new to entertain audiences. Watchable!\n\nRound-Up:\nThis movie was written and directed by Christopher McQuarrie, who also brought you The Way of the Gun, which I really enjoyed, Jack Reacher and Mission Impossible: Rogue Nation. He also produced Valkyrie and Jack Reacher: Never Go Back, and he wrote the Usual Suspects, The Way of the Gun, Valkyrie, The Tourist, Jack Reacher, Jack The Giant Slayer, Edge Of Tomorrow, Mission Impossible: Rogue Nation and The Mummy which also starred Tom Cruise. McQuarrie and Cruise have built a healthy relationship over the years, which is why they produce some of the most extravagant stunts seen in film. It might also explain why most of Tom Cruise's films are similar to each other, and we always have the famous running scene, which gets on my nerves. With another Top Gun in the pipeline, which is also being directed by McQuarrie, Tom Cruise is definitely a true Hollywood star, and he is still got the audiences flocking to the cinema, judging by the profit that this movie made. After the terrible, The Mummy, I did think that people had enough of Cruise's action blockbusters but this movie has proved that one bad movie won't tarnish his name. As this is the 7th highest-grossing film of 2018, which is Cruise's highest-grossing film to date, and the highest-grossing film in the franchise, I'm sure the MI franchise isn't over, even though Cruise is 56 years old. \n\nBudget: $178million\nWorldwide Gross: $791million\n\nGenre: Action, Adventure, Thriller\nCast: Tom Cruise, Henry Cavill, Ving Rhames, Simon Pegg, Rebecca Ferguson, Sean Harris, Angela Bassett, Michelle Monaghan, Wes Bentley, Alec Baldwin, Vanessa Kirby and Frederick Schmidt. 5/10\n\nPlease check out my Movie Review blog at leonblackwood.wordpress.com",

Maybe he took a slight hit getting beaten up in the rest room, but then he comes out swinging in a cavalcade of action sequences strung in to a movie.\nYou might vaguely recall the Point Break remake from a couple of years back.  That movie rivaled this one for stunts and scenery, but while PB was all stunts and nothing else, MI has settled in to a relationship film of sorts - with the girlfriend, ex-wife, and his team (Pegg and Rhames).  And of course this amps up the stakes for Cruise as he has to run from friend to friend to save them.  Much of this is predictable of course, and the world is at stake AGAIN; but Fallout again does a great job of retreading what is a very familiar story.  There are even scenes that point out how Cruise is a hamster on a wheel and trapped.\nSupporting cast is so-so.  Lane is nice and creepy.  Superman plays the ass pretty well.  Alec Baldwin is killed - so that is always a plus in a movie.\nI am starting to feel bad for Cruise's character - every movie he saves the world, and then he gets second and third guessed by suits in Washington - there goes the guy that saved the world the wrong way!",

No political bullshit, betrayal of the team and such like nonsense.\n\nHowever, in pretty much every movie Ethan or the entire IMF team was betrayed or set up and he had to, not only complete his mission but, clear IMF from whatever shenanigans the story writers had dreamed up. The movies have been Mission Impossible in name only. I wonder if the moron script writers has ever watched the show.\n\nIn this movie too there is indeed a bunch of political nonsense and betrayal. Shit that I could be without. But at least IMF and Ethan's team are on his side throughout the movie. There are also a few clever parts where they trick the bad guys in a good old fashioned Mission Impossible style.\n\nOtherwise the movie is mostly a classical Hollywood action adventure/thriller movie. Plenty of, more or less, non stop action. There are a few of the usual WTF story holes and defiance of physics when it comes to the stunts of course. The dumbass CIA director was a completely unnecessary element though.\n\nStill, overall I found this installment in the franchise to be one of the better ones. Maybe even the best one yet.",

I thought the performance from the actors was great with some amazing stunt scenes. I did find the storyline to have too many plot twists but was very predictable and the film did drag on more than it needed to. The good this about this film is that it doesn't really matter if you've watched any of the other mission impossible films and is very easy to pick up and understand whats going on. Action isn't my favorite genre which is probably why I didn't enjoy this film to much as I found it very long and quite boring.

There is literally nothing I can pick apart in this film, as act by act, the pacing, story line and action pieces flow so perfectly , that they are nothing short of perfection. Meticulously crafted, choreographed and shot, they are a visual adrenaline rush AND NEED TO BE SEEN IN IMAX.\n\nFor his 6th go around as IMF Agent Ethan Hunt, Cruise SOMEHOW ups the ante and seems hell bent on creating a cinematic experience that won't be forgotten. I had the privilege of watching this with a GREAT crowd in a packed theatre and after several action pieces, people were clapping and cheering. That's how good he is.\nHis \u00ef\u00bf 1/2I\u00ef\u00bf 1/2(TM)ll thrill you or die trying\u00ef\u00bf 1/2? attitude makes this one of the most perfectly conceived blockbusters in recent memory.\n\nCast members from M:I old come in throughout for support and give this a great deja vu feeling, but the real stand out is easily Henry Cavill. Cold blooded, heavy handed and without remorse , he is F**King awesome in this movie as a CIA Agent sent to chaperone Hunt. I won't spoil anything but a particular bathroom scene highlights why Cavill is a pure badass and how he can be a big action star outside of his Superman role.\n\nI could go on and on about a million things I enjoyed , as Director Christopher McQuarrie's directing, Cinematographer Rob Hardy' s INCREDIBLE WAY OF CAPTURING action and Lorne Balfe's methodical and tense score make this for the BEST movie of the summer.\nGO SEE THIS\n\nGrade : A +",

            "content": "The older Tom Cruise gets, the less time there is between his Mission: Impossible sequels. There was a mere four years between the first and second installments and it seemed that might be the end of things, but six years later when Tom Cruise needed a public face lift it was Ethan Hunt who was called on to come to the rescue. Five years passed and the series reinvigorated itself with Brad Bird's franchise-best, Ghost Protocol, and then four years passed before writer/director Christopher McQuarrie took over and teamed with Cruise to produce the worthy follow-up that was Rogue Nation. Now, only three years have passed between the last and what is now the sixth installment in this ever-expanding action franchise. I can only imagine that we'll have another Mission: Impossible movie by 2020 at which point Mr. Cruise will be fifty-eight years-old. It is not only Cruise's age that splinters the race against time these movies will become though, but also the fact the one-time biggest movie star on the planet is hard-pressed to find success elsewhere outside the franchise. This creates questions of what might Cruise do once he's no longer able to jump out of airplanes, scale mountains, or fly helicopters, but these are questions more curious than they are concerning. For now, audiences should simply revel in the fact Cruise can still accomplish what he has in order to bring FALLOUT to the biggest screen ever-which is where you should see it. Mission: Impossible - FALLOUT is the pinnacle of what it seems this entire series, knowing or unknowingly, has been leading to. It is McQuarrie's The Dark Knight, it is Cruise's commitment to celluloid that will define the middle act of his career, and it is by far one of the best action movies ever made. Yes, FALLOUT is everything a fan of the previous films could want in that it revolves around a convoluted plot of double crossings and inconspicuous baddies throwing obstacles at our beloved team of core heroes, but what elevates this latest entry above many of the others is the way in which it caps off this trilogy of sorts that began with Ghost Protocol where these movies weren't just using Cruise's Hunt as a conduit for action or trying to humanize him, but more discover the person Hunt actually is while detailing his journey to figure out who he truly wants to be. FALLOUT is as much a coming to terms and peace with who the character is for Ethan Hunt as it is a clarification on the haze that still tinged who Hunt was over the last few films. How this will affect future installments will remain to be seen, but as the core of FALLOUT it only adds substantial weight to a movie that excels in every other facet of the genre it is excited to exist within.\n\nread the whole review at www.reviewsfromabed.com",

(The film interestingly stars Trump adversary Alec Baldwin).\nThe film has great stunt work some of which are noticeably performed by star Tom Cruise himself. One particularly painful stunt landed Cruise with an injury that halted filming for a while. The stunt makes the final cut. The pain is there to see!\nHowever the action sequences have been seen before in other films, most noticeably the James Bond franchise.\nI lost count of the number of times I said to my wife who was also watching. I've seen this before in such and such or wait for the scuba divers to rescue the guy locked in a security vehicle which has been rammed into a river!\nI am trying not to make my liking of the Bond films effect my review but it is difficult at times!\nThe story is a little complicated but the action keeps your attention span and director Christopher McQuarrie paces the film well. The film has a two and a half hour run time which passes very quickly.\nSpy film aficionados will also take note of the casting of Henry Cavill as CIA agent August Walker. Cavill was cast in spy film The Man From U.N.C.L.E. in 2015.\nDirector Christopher McQuarrie directed the last Mission: Impossible entry 'Rogue Nation' back in 2015 so comes with experience.\nTalking of experience the crew are veterans or the next generation of Bond film veterans (here he goes again!).\nI thoroughly enjoyed the film despite my picky protestations above.",

Fast paced, stylish and vastly entertaining, this is not only a reminder of how insane Tom Cruise\u2019s dedication to delivering big screen thrills is but also a prime example of how movies are originally meant to be watched on the big screen. Christopher McQuarrie makes Fallout feels a lot like the first Mission: Impossiblemovie than any other film in the franchise, but also cleverly takes everything good about the franchise and marinates it all into one movie. The stunts, staged with vigor and a sharp eye for spatial balance by writer-director Christopher McQuarrie, grow wilder as Fallout goes on. And, admittedly, they\u2019re a hoot. Cruise brings a work ethic as solid as the movie\u2019s narrative ethic is hectic, generously and subtly conducting an outstanding supporting cast that includes M:I veterans Ving Rhames, Simon Pegg, Rebecca Ferguson and Alec Baldwin. Some of Fallout\u2019s most delicious scenes, though, feature Cruise and Vanessa Kirby, leaving behind her Princess Margaret persona from \u201cThe Crown\u201d to play a fascinatingly saucy minx of indistinct motivation. McQuarrie finally asks what sort of man keeps accepting those missions; what drives someone to put their life on the line again and again? For Hunt, the answer is simple. He can save people, and therefore he has a responsibility to act. For Cruise \u2014 and McQuarrie \u2014 it\u2019s an eternal quest to outdo the last effort. They\u2019re only making the next one difficult by succeeding this hard.",

It's spectacular action pieces, that seem rooted in realism. I remember nowt about the previous five, and it just doesn't matter. The plot's wafer thin, but it doesn't matter. You get the gist.\n\nHenry Cavill is a great love-hate bromance, then evil foe. Indeed it's one of those films in which heroes and villains are continually blurred. We are never sure who is trying to kill Ethan, who is trying to help him and who is simply there for the money.\n\nSo chill and enjoy the set pieces, there are too many to mention. The stand-off in a car park, brutal fight sequence in the gents, a riveting motorbike chase through the streets of Paris, a  rooftop chase from St Paul's Cathedral to the Tate Modern, helicopter battle; and a clifftop climax.\n\nInvigorating viewing, just wish we'd had more of the theme tune.",

Don't expect anything revolutionary or new. That's not what this is about. What you will get is another up-tempo, dazzling rollercoaster full of beautiful people doing incredible things. You might poke holes in the plot or roll your eyes at some of the more predictable twists, but you'll still enjoy every minute of it.

There is a scene around the start of the movie, where Ethan and Walker skydive down, Walker was struck by a lightning bolt and the scene looked amazing, the sound was spectacular and incredibly realistic, the special effects were also on point. The lighting varied due to different day times in the movie, majority of the scenes were shot during the day time with the sun shining, other parts were shot at nightime. The final scene in the movie was incredible as the scene was gruesome and exiting.\n\nThere were a lot of plot twists throughout the movie and a lot of unexpected scenes, out of 5 stars I would give this wonderful movie a 4.5 out of 5.

The several cities they visit in the film e.g. London, Paris and Kashmir make the movie more attractive as these places have good  landscapes and landmarks. I think the sound in movie was superb as it was used at the right time to build up suspense especially in fight scenes. I also really enjoyed the Mission Impossible theme that was going on through the movie as it sounded really nice. I think the performances in the movie were great. Tom Cruise's performance  as Ethan Hunt in the action thriller stands out as earlier in the movie when he saves Luther. This told me that he really cares about the people that are close to him and he wouldn't trade the life of someone he really cares about with the lives of  millions of strangers. The supporting cast also have great performances, Rebecca Ferguson as Ilsa Faust an agent who has similar motives with Ethan but their past relationship  gets both of them tangled up in their missions. Henry Cavill has a stellar performance as August Walker/ John Lark is a CIA  Assassin whos mission is to keep an eye on Hunt and his team. There's a great plot twist as if Walker is really cooperating with Hunt or trying to take him down as a double agent. Ving Rhames as Luther Stickell is more of the heart of the team who cares a lot for Ethan and also has some comedic moments. Simon Pegg  as Benji Dunn is more of the tech wizz in the team who also Ethan cares a lot about. He has several comedic moments throughout  the film and is one of the core members of the team.",

The use of sound effects made the film seem very intense and realistic to what you was watching.  The use of different camera angles and clever editing made the film much very gripping on its own. There is not a boring moment throughout the whole film. \n\nThe mise en scene in the film has a wide range of differences. For example, some parts of the movie are set in major capitals of the world such as London and Paris but towards the end of the film, in the helicopter fight scene , it is set within the outskirts of China, within the snowy mountains.\n\nThe costume worn within the film make it easy to know who is who , for example Ethan Hunt ,played by Tom Cruise, is shown wearing a suit at the start of the film so we know he is an important character to the story. Also the suit hints that he may be James Bond style character, which we soon find out he is.",

Because i was just watching what was happening and i was trying to work out the plot in my head of who's done this and who hasn't. But i do remember they used a lot of mid shots where it would either pan side to side or it would follow the actors/ actress along. They do this because they want your eyes to focus on certain things for example when Solomon Lane is in the helicopter they want you to focus on him because he is going to be a main part of the story. Something else the directors do a lot is a tracking shot where they follow certain characters around to make it look like your with them so you feel like your apart of the story which entices the audience more. Another shot the directors used a lot is a long shot on bits of the film that are suspenseful because they can create a tense atmosphere if it was used right and it was definitely used the right way in this film.",

I believe during this film they have not to appeared to be many green screen shots from watching all the stunts that Tom Cruise has done. As well as it being very suspenseful from the cuts from scenes, which have been moved quickly from one to another. So there is no dull moments in the film. \n\nThe mise-en-scene of the film is that there is a range of interesting settings of all major city, for example London and Paris. There is also a lot of typical secret agent outfits for example suits. The lighting plays a huge part in this film because it changes with the mood of the scene creating an atmosphere, as well as the colour of the surroundings. The camera angles have also created an interesting effect on the film because every scene it has work well will, because of how many camera angles there have to make you feel happy, tension or afraid. For example watching Tom Cruise\u00ef\u00bf 1/2(TM)s character Ethan Hunt jump from the plane you see him from below, then above and constantly changing.   \n\nAll round I think the movie was made well and is a great watch for people who enjoy action movies.",

When Ethan Hunt and his team fail to recover a case of nuclear material they're forced to use an old adversary to get it back.  The first direct sequel of the series, the film does a good job at continuing and building on the characters and themes from Rogue Nation.  And the fight scenes and chases are exciting and full of energy.  However, the plot's a bit convoluted as times and some of the performances are a little lackluster.  Yet while it has a few rough spots, Mission: Impossible - Fallout is a high-adrenaline spy thriller that's incredibly entertaining.",

            "content": "Incredible movie! It was one of those few that I wound up chasing all over the state of California, as it left one theater but remained at another, because I wanted to catch every movie showing of it that I could. I had watched the Rogue Nation one, in theaters, over and over again, and this time, my sister joined me for Fallout, trying to catch multiple screenings, on the big screen. As exciting and thrilling as every action sequence was, as mysterious and surprising as every plot twist or double-crossing was, what I appreciated the most about this movie was how much was subtly communicated by a mere raising of an eyebrow, or barely a wink. Slight changes in facial expressions told so much. Perhaps it's just me, but when Sloane describes Walker as \"a hammer\", I wondered if he got his high position, within the CIA, through some kind of sexual act. But that's probably just my dirty mind, there. It took me a few viewings to catch every subtle non-spoken gesture, but when I finally did, the movie became even more entertaining; when the IMF are detaining both Walker and Solomon Lane in cuffs, and then Walker nods, just slightly, towards Solomon Lane, Walker is reassuring Lane that he has completely infiltrated the CIA, so nothing Sloane has ordered will be carried through successfully. When Benji and Luther are glaring; angry at Walker, while cramped into the backseat of the tiny car, it is because it is dawning on them that Walker only secured a car big enough for 4 men, not 5, because he expected Ethan Hunt would've been captured and arrested by that time; framed as John Lark. Then my favorite: Ethan asks Julia if her husband, Eric, knows who he is, and Julia quickly shakes her head \"no\", but as Ethan and Eric talk to each-other, it becomes clear that Eric DOES know who Ethan is, that Eric HAS heard of Ethan. Julia only denied that because she is trying to protect Eric from the same danger that she and Ethan have constantly found themselves in, because of who Ethan is. At the end, when Ethan is in a hospital tent, and Eric advises Ethan not to move, and he tells him that Sloane had arrived \"right in front of half the Indian army\", he adds: \"See you later, Doc,\" and he winks at Ethan. It's so quick, don't blink or you'll miss it. Eric is making it clear: by that time, he has figured out who Ethan is. In a few of the earlier scenes, Eric seems a little bit uncomfortable or he has a very concerned expression on his face, but his concern is that Ethan's presence signals danger to himself and his wife. He knows that enemies of Ethan have tried to harm Julia before. No matter what draws you to this movie, whether it's the very dangerous action scenes, the death-defying stunts, the love story, the mystery and suspense, it totally satisfies on all levels. I also truly appreciate the messages regarding morality and empathy. As always, Ethan Hunt is a fearless, boundless gentleman; a total class act.",

As a pure action film, it's one of the finest I've seen this year. Writer/Director Christopher McQuarrie clearly understands that, for action to be exciting, it must first be comprehensible. The chase sequences are beautifully shot and assembled, and I could often feel my fists tightening when the heroes we're close to danger, they're that tense. It does frequently suffer from Fast & Furious Syndrome, the term I've devised to describe characters who are so immune from damage and death that's there's never any reason to worry about them, and the films plot is a bad combination of old hat and swerve-obsessed. Admittedly some of the twists are pretty funny, but the film is constantly trying to make it seem like everyone is a bad guy at some point and it quickly becomes tiresome. But aside from that, and its assortment of often frustratingly ambiguous spy movie dialogue, it's a tonne of fun, and more than worth watching for the action sequences alone.",

His fearless stubbornness/devotion by the explosive AAA blockbuster seemed to respond to an obsessive self-assigned responsibility for raising the torch pathetically abandoned by old legends like Stallone, Gibson or Schwarzenegger. That is greatly appreciated.\n\nFallout has plane-sequences in HALO Jumps, violent fights choreographies a-lo-Iko-Uwais and ambitious pursuits in the league of Mad Max: Fury Road, combined with the saga's recurring tropes as the bomb saved in the last second and the betrayals revealed by multiple unmasks. And it's a blast.\n\nBTW, fuck Superman. I'm glad mustachioed Henry Cavill stood tall. He has a devastating presence, and his predictable alliance actually helps build that.\n\nIn terms of action, this is the best one in the series, and of all time.",

Fallout is a thrilling, well thought out movie by Christopher McQuarrie. \n\nTom Cruise returns as Ethan Hunt again with a great performance. He is not only impressive (with the major set pieces Fallout presents) but he is also plays believable character. As far as the characterization of Ethan Hunt, Fallout proves to be the best version of him yet. Ethan has to make tough choices to save what matters to him and it often comes at a cost. He has regrets, fears, and he makes mistakes despite his experience in the field and unique set of skills. Hunt's depth adds much more to this film than any previous entry before it. \n\nIn a sense, this is more a of a spy movie than a typical Mission Impossible movie. Instead of the story being built around the set pieces, the set pieces fit more organically into the film. The antagonist has more of a reason to exist in Fallout than just as a big bad to kill. His reasoning is flawed, but he has complex reasons for doing what he does. Our villain is a genuinely terrifying and serves as an equal to the godlike skills of someone such Ethan Hunt. \n\nThe returning team members are a welcome sight. The Mission Impossible Franchise has had a difficult time with continuity. Aside from Cruise,  the cast is constantly being shaken up in each movie. Rebecca Ferguson, Simon Pegg, Ving Rhames, and Michelle Monaghan are highlights as returning members of the supporting cast. All them play central roles in the plot and to Ethan's character. This movie also goes out of its way to make connections to the rest of the franchise, which is a nice shoutout the earlier movies. \n\nHenry Cavill gets to spread his wings with August Walker, the CIA agent forced to work with Ethan. Cavill is powerful in his stature and performance. He demonstrates another level to his acting skills that I never saw until Fallout. He plays Walker perfectly. \n\nMission Impossible Fallout is by far the best film in a franchise that continues to improve with each entry. Between the stellar cast and excellent script, this movie serves as an example for what action movies should aspire to be: gripping, deep, and unforgettable.",

Predictable plot twists, not much originality, and in the desire to pack in as much as possible, excessively long at two and a half hours.  The improbable (dare I say impossible?) sequence with the fifteen minute countdown seemed to last a half hour at least.  I liked how Cruise (ageless at 56) sometimes gets knocked down or fails in this one, and the stunning shots in Kashmir.  It's a summer blockbuster that filmgoers lapped up like ice cream, and it's entertaining enough as it trots out all the usual tropes.  I do wish the mentality was 'less is more' instead of 'more is better', and that there was as much creativity in the story as there was in the stunts.  I'm clearly in the minority though.",

HAHA. In 15 minutes Cruise stole a helicopter, fell from it in midair hanging from it, climbed back up, disarmed two soldiers, took over the helicopter, chased the other dude through mountains getting shot at for what seemed like forever, then crashed the mountains, meanwhile the other crew spent time looking for the bomb, got captured, tied up, got loose, fought the bad guy for what seemed like 20 minutes. We have to pretend a woman was able to beat the hell out of a trained soldiers. \n\nAfter all of that there was still 5 minutes left on the clock..

Lots of bad guys (hard to keep track of all of them), and so many twists and turns, that it makes following the plot, quite challenging.

I was constantly at the edge of my seat, I got the jokes and the action sequenses were amazing. The thing with this movie and all the movies in the series is that when you see Tom Cruise hanging under a helicopter, he is actually doing it, so the adrenaline is at its highest. The car chases and movements were very realistic. The casting was perfect and the storyline fantastic. The 3rd act could be the best 3rd act I have seen in a movie for a very long time. I have nothing bad to say about this movie. 5/5 stars",

            "content": "I've always had kind of a love/hate relationship with the Mission Impossible series to be honest.  On one hand, the original Mission Impossible was easily one of the best blockbusters of the 90's and it was an interesting slow-burn thriller in addition to having memorable set pieces.  (And they were memorable.  Name one quote or location from the sequels that stood out without looking it up.  Brian De Palma knew his craft.)  And one must admire the practical effects the series has become known for.  Tom Cruise does seem to court death when making these, insisting to do almost every stunt himself.  But I honestly do not particularly care for the sequels.  An issue, it seems, on which I am probably alone.  Many have noted how the sequels are outlandish fun and embrace the inherent wackiness of the spy genre.  At the same time Bond got more serious and in touch with his Ian Fleming roots, Mission Impossible went NUTS and audiences rewarded the franchise for it.  Impossible seems to have a similar trajectory and fanbase to the Fast and the Furious series, with each movie getting progressively more over-the-top.  Both are self-aware of how ridiculous the whole thing has gotten.  But that's okay.  YOU are in on the joke.  \n\nThe most recent iteration, Mission Impossible: Fallout surprisingly has no power armor, Vault-Tec, super mutants, or Pip-Boys.  (Bad joke.  Sorry.)  No, you already know the gist of these movies.  The plot is essentially meaningless.  Blah, blah, blah, infiltrate bad guys.  Blah, blah, blah, doublecross.  Blah, Blah, Blah, nukes.  Blah, blah, blah, we've got to get the detonator before everyone dies.  You are here for the set pieces and to watch the Space Pope run from explosions and hang out of planes and helicopters in peril.  This movie is a direct sequel to Fallout: Rogue Nation, so it may have helped to have seen that movie and remembered something about it.  (Good luck with that.)  That being said, the series does have some great recurring characters at this point (such as Ving Rhames, Simon Pegg, and Rebecca Ferguson) whose supporting performances do add quite a bit of humor and occasional drama.  There is a bit of a return to old world spy craft and a retreat from the sci-fi tech of the previous two movies, which is a welcome change.  Tom Cruise commits totally, as mentioned before, and he is allowed several good scenes with different actors, including an enthusiastic Henry Cavill.  Many have called this \"the best action movie of the year.\"  To me, this wouldn't sound accurate even if there wasn't plenty of 2018 to go.  But it may be the best rental movie of 2018.  So yes, while it may not be my cup of tea, Mission Impossible: Fallout would make a perfectly adequate rental or streaming option, should you choose to accept it.",

Tom Cruise is great as this character and because he does his own stunts and they are insane, it makes this franchise better for it. Henry Cavill is great in this movie, being this tough brawler CIA agent. This movie takes everything you would want from a Mission Impossible movie. It has great action, an interesting story, cool twists and turns that I did not see coming except for one of them. and it also has comedy.

In terms of story, it is mostly your standard spy thriller stuff, which honestly I'm not always the biggest fan of.  I like spy movies fine, I especially like watching the spies work and use all their gadgets and just do their job, but when it comes to their convoluted plots it's a little hard for me to get invested.  Again, this was a drawback for me in Fallout.  The core of the story works fine, but some of the little detours to get their felt unnecessary, and there was a twist that I saw coming since the first trailer.  Also without going too deep into spoilers, how many times is Mission Impossible going to deal with a double crossing agent?  These issues aside, the story still works for the most part because the characters work.  The villain's motivations do seem straight up psychotic, but when you hears his explanation you do kind of see where he's coming from.  I mean it's still psychotic and you know he needs to be stopped, but you understand how he got to that point.  It addresses the toll of Ethan Hunt's career on his personal life (which almost seems meta to Tom Cruise now that I think about it), and while I miss Jeremy Renner it's nice to see Ving Rhames and Simon Pegg returning and their team chemistry is just as good as ever.\nEnough about all that though, how's the action?  It's Mission Impossible, it's great.  These movies have become known for having some of the best action ever for use of practical effects, no stunt doubles, and the very real possibility Tom Cruise might die.  There were a few scenes where I found myself looking for the wires or looking for the edges for the green screen or CGI, and I couldn't find it; so either it was all real or they did a damn good job of making it look real.  In either case, kudos.  It's also the type of action that is godamn relentless almost to the point of parody.  It pushes things right up to the edge; literally, if there's a scene by a cliff where something has a chance of falling you bet your ass it will tumble right to the godamn corner of that that Cliffside.  The movie pushes you and pushes and pushes and then pulls back just a little bit only to push one final time.  It's godamn artistry in tension.  It's that perfect sort of tension where, hey, we know this type of movie, we have a pretty good idea that the good guys are going to win, but we're still tense every step of the way.  There's scenes where I'm thinking \"I know Tom Cruise can't die because he's in more way scenes in the trailer, we're only halfway through the movie, and he's godamn Tom Cruise, so why am I so worried about him right now?\".  It's an impressive level of tension that reminded me of Spielberg at his best moments.  Mind you it's not quite up to that same level, but that I'm even considering that comparison is godamn impressive.\nBottom line, Mission Impossible: Fallout is just a near perfect spy movie.  My biggest complaints come from the fact that it's a bit too long, and while I enjoyed it all it did start to wear on me, and the fact that spy stories just don't always draw me in personally.  If spy stories are your thing though, there's not much better.  I still loved the movie mind you, it's about as good a spy movie as I could ever hope to see.  I love the team, I love seeing these people work, and it's some of the best practical action I've ever seen.",

There were a few scenes where I found myself looking for the wires or looking for the edges for the green screen or CGI, and I couldn't find it; so either it was all real or they did a damn good job of making it look real.  In either case, kudos.  It's also the type of action that is godamn relentless almost to the point of parody.  It pushes things right up to the edge; literally, if there's a scene by a cliff where something has a chance of falling you bet your ass it will tumble right to the godamn corner of that that Cliffside.  The movie pushes you and pushes and pushes and then pulls back just a little bit only to push one final time.  It's godamn artistry in tension.  It's that perfect sort of tension where, hey, we know this type of movie, we have a pretty good idea that the good guys are going to win, but we're still tense every step of the way.  There's scenes where I'm thinking \"I know Tom Cruise can't die because he's in more way scenes in the trailer, we're only halfway through the movie, and he's godamn Tom Cruise, so why am I so worried about him right now?\".  It's an impressive level of tension that reminded me of Spielberg at his best moments.  Mind you it's not quite up to that same level, but that I'm even considering that comparison is godamn impressive.\nBottom line, Mission Impossible: Fallout is just a near perfect spy movie.  My biggest complaints come from the fact that it's a bit too long, and while I enjoyed it all it did start to wear on me, and the fact that spy stories just don't always draw me in personally.  If spy stories are your thing though, there's not much better.  I still loved the movie mind you, it's about as good a spy movie as I could ever hope to see.  I love the team, I love seeing these people work, and it's some of the best practical action I've ever seen.",

            "content": "I think this got pretty over hyped for me. After all the critical praise I was expecting the best action movie of the year, and I definitely didn't get that. The action is really great, it's pulse pounding and well choreographed. But the plot is just so generic and predictable. Every time someone's face is revealed it feels like it was telegraphed a mile away, and the story is about them trying to stop an ex-spy with a personal vendetta who is going to set off some nukes. I'm pretty sure there are like five James Bond movies with that exact plot. \n\nI think a big part of the hype was the whole thing about Tom Cruise actually flying the helicopter, but it didn't really add anything. The way they captured the action with stationary cameras actually made it feel less real to me. Like if they had shot it on a green screen it wouldn't have made a difference. They never got one great shot that made it all worth it. It reminds me of Boyhood; a mediocre film praised for it's production rather than it's actual content. Not that Fallout is as bad as Boyhood. It is good. Far too long, but good. I loved the washroom fight, Simon Pegg is always a joy to watch. It had a really good balance of humour and action and I'm probably being way to harsh on it.  Just wish it had a smarter screenplay.",

This is greatest stunt performance ever by an actor. It took him years to learn to do the HALO jump for this film, and in doing so is the first actor ever to record on camera. It is absolutely breathting. Not even a broken ankle stops Cruise at the age of 56. It is unreal.\nDirector Christopher McQuarie returns for his second Mission: Impossible film after 2015's \"Rogue Nation\" and \"Fallout\" is easily better. Not to take anything away from \"Rogue Nation\". \"Fallout\" is McQuarie's best film to date and is leaving me curious if another Mission: Impossible film will grace the screen and if McQuarie and Cruise will return if there is.\nThe script is simply downright badass and awesome. Cruise and company deliver every line with power and confidence. Written solo\nby McQaurie the script also holds many details and callbacks to the previous films which are interesting and cool to\nsee. Henry Cavill and Sean Harris are ideal villains as members of the Syndicate. They both seem fearless, determined, and incredibly difficult to stop. \nIn the end, \"Fallout\" takes your breath away time and time again. Giving you faith in all summer blockbusters, it was totally worth the wait. Your mission should you choose to accept is to read this review and see \"Mission: Impossible-Fallout\" now!",

Unrealistic premises aside, this is actually a really good action movie. For me, it's still not up to par with 2011's Ghost Protocol, but you can't deny the pure unadulterated entertainment of this movie. The film is a fantastic mix of intrigue and action, and you have to pay attention to keep everything straight, there is a lot going on and the plot points get pretty muddled. Just trying to keep up with who is on whose side was enough to make my head spin. The nearly constant action sequences serve nicely to distract you from the less than seamless story. The movie is packed with car chases (sponsored by BMW!), foot chases, fights, and incredible stunts (sponsored by Tom Cruise!). As with Rogue Nation, the players have changed a bit, but as long as Benji (Simon Pegg) is still part of the team, I'm in - he is the heart of these movies, and they wouldn't work without him. Jeremy Renner's Brandt has been unceremoniously deleted without explanation this go-round (in the same way Paula Patton was omitted without fanfare after Ghost Protocol), but Henry Cavill is a worthy replacement as good/bad guy Walker. This dude has swag that he has never shown as Superman, and most of the time, I was rooting for him. Now I understand why Cavill refused to shave his mustache for the Justice League reshoots... this is a meatier role in a worthier movie. The film's weak point is its length - it's too long, and by the time the climactic action sequence rolls around, you're kind of numb to it all. But with every installment, this franchise has been more and more successful at blending the spy thriller with the action movie, which makes these movies rise above the standard \"shoot 'em up\" popcorn flick to become a truly satisfying movie-going experience.",

While a Popular Film category might be a sorry excuse to exclude movies like this from the Best Picture category, it's a start. Nearly every action scene in this movie was perfectly executed. The biggest problem I have with many action movies such as this is that they have a hard time immersing people, at least the people I know, into the action. I have a hard time grasping the stakes and how tense each moment is. However, this film not only immerses me into the action, it makes my heart race and forms goosebumps on my skin. During the skydiving scene, I legitimately felt as if I were tens of thousands of feet in the air. I believe the gem of this film is the bathroom scene as each movement feels important. Each punch, kick, etc. knocks back characters and harms them, it's also just precisely choreographed and feels very well-paced, which I think is something most action scenes lack. Overall, this movie is a masterpiece and everyone should see this film now!",

In regards to the Mission Impossible movies I like almost all of them except 2 but this has to be the best in the series. The plot maybe an issue for some people as its a bit hard to follow if you don't pay attention but I like the fact that the movie is not just a collection of mindless action sequences but it requires you to invest in the plot. The issue with the mission impossible movies has often been the villain but here we got the second best antagonist in the series after Phillip Seymour Hoffman's character in MI 3. All in all, if you love good action set-pieces go watch this movie, if you like good spy thrillers go watch this movie, if you love film in general go watch this movie guys.",

I had to watch this movie 2 times and I can't wait till it comes out on DVD or digital download.  The movie 147 minutes, but it really doesn't feel like a long movie.  The only one thing I can honestly point out and say \"I did not like it\".  Was the extended Tom Cruise running.  I think that is the only thing that they could have cut some time on.

All of the Star Wars movies .. WTF!!) when the first movie only managed 64%. What the utter F*#^k. Does anyone else think it's a co incidence that the ratings for mission impossible franchise have rapidly increased over the years ..\nThe acting is shit, the plot makes 0 sense and even the action sequences are poor- except the one where Tom cruise actually broke his leg in real life- maybe he was actually trying to jump off that building before this hit the cinemas ..\nIf you want to watch an action spoof go and watch Macruber- which is intentionally trying to make fun at action movies.

            "content": "The sixth entry in the long-running series, Mission: Impossible-Fallout continues the films' running streak of escalating quality in action, direction, and presentation. Every aspect of Fallout feels like it's been polished up since the last film, resulting in an unrelenting, adrenaline-soaked thrill ride that never fails to impress with every new scenario and set piece. \nA nice touch to Fallout is that it uniquely brandishes itself as a true sequel to many of the past films in the franchise. Apart from some recurring characters such as Simon Pegg's Benji and Ving Rhames' Luther,  the films have mostly played themselves out as a series of standalone episodes in relation to each other. Fallout makes some notable connections to Ethan's previous missions, especially the last entry, Rogue Nation. The Apostles are a natural extension of Rogue Nation's Syndicate, and Rebecca Ferguson, Alec Baldwin, and Sean Harris' reprised roles, as well as the first returning director in the series, Christopher McQuarrie, give the film a pleasantly weighty boost in continuity. The film also works perfectly well as a stand-alone, to boot. \nAlso returning is Tom Cruise's unmatched vigor for the action hero role-it's clear how much Cruise relishes the part as he yells, runs, jumps, and shoots across the screen with all his might. His genuine, all-in attitude continues to play a large part in selling the character and the franchise as a whole.\nFurthermore, Cruise's fearless stunt work is elevated to the nth degree through McQuarrie's direction and Rob Hardy's breathtaking cinematography. McQuarrie's mature style carries over from Rogue Nation with engaging, beautifully crafted visuals that few action films ever allow themselves to present. The stiller moments always have something going for them, and when bullets start flying, the film has some of the best action in the series, bar none. \nFeaturing a mesmerizing HALO jump shot in long takes, a brutal, close-quarters bathroom fight, one of the best car chases put to film, and topped with a high-tension helicopter brawl, everything looks real because it is real; there's no trace of computer-generated embellishment to the ridiculous stunt work done in camera. Fallout is a true achievement in pure, practical filmmaking, and alongside 2015's equally ambitious Mad Max: Fury Road, it goes to show how much better movies can turn out when done with this very real level of effort.\nOn another, gripier note, Fallout lacks any trace of depth of substance apart from its mind-blowing action. It's not like it needs it; the film delivers exactly what it promises with masterful execution. It's also the longest entry in the series at nearly two-and-a-half hours, but that's also not as much a complaint as it is another observation. \nMission: Impossible-Fallout is another fantastic addition to the series that takes the already high bar set by its predecessors and sets it another two pegs higher.",

All stunts are real and you definitely worry for the hero because you know he had to do all of that for real. Interesting point is that there were 2 big actions scenes which didn't have any music and it definitely felt different and I noticed that. This movie definitely feels different and it was amazing to watch it, I had a lot of great emotions. Tom Cruise is as always amazing, the amount of work and risk he put into this movie is more than most actors do in their entire career. He's definitely an example for other actors and hopefully more actors will start making movies with a similar dedication. I watched this movie in 4DX format and it made it even more realistic, I definitely recommend it. After that I watched it twice more in 2D.\n\nThis movie has really a lot of stunts. Amazing halo jump scene, fighting scene, shooting scene, motorbike chase scene, car chase scene, amazing intense TC running scene, helicopter chase scene... It's absolutely amazing stunts and all done with no CGI and 100% Tom Cruise!",

There are parts that make you jump but you are constantly wondering what will happen next and it made me feel a mixture of emotions and that's when you know you have got a good film . Story line was really good and the acting was excellent. A must watch !!!!",

Fast paced, plenty of action and twists, fun dynamics between characters. The chase scenes in Paris well done. The martial artist in the restroom was good. Helicopter battle and final dukeout quite dramatic. Of course, you know how it ends.\n\nI like that Ethan Hunt and Julia finally get  some closure that he really needed. At long last he has peace about her.\n\nQuestions for next time: did August Walker survive? Now that he has closure with Julia will Ethan find love?\n\nLastly, I watched cast interviews about the making of this. They said Tom Cruise did a dangerous stunt without safety  measures in the making of this, putting his life on the line. Did that make the movie better? Well.....maybe. it was a good scene BUT fairly short compared to the overall length of movie.Was it worth it? I think not. Keep your star alive to make another movie. Yeah he lived this time but  what about next time? \n\nWhy? Who knows. I'm guessing adrenaline junkie. I'm guessing there may be good therapy for that. Dunno. Before doing it again, there is a good question to ask: who needs you?",

            "content": "There isn't much left to say about \"Mission Impossible: Fallout.\" While overall it's not quite as great of a film as you've heard, it rates an A+ when it comes to rousing action. The practical stunts are hair-raising, and it's far and away the best film in the franchise. You likely do not need any convincing to go see this blockbuster, but I will encourage you to head to the theaters immediately to watch this on the biggest screen possible.\n\nIt's frantic and fun, setting the bar high for mainstream action films. Featuring what are arguably some of the best action sequences in modern cinema history, the movie is also dazzling to look at with its grand scale cinematography. When the clock starts ticking, there's a thrilling sense of real danger - especially when Tom Cruise himself is dangling from a helicopter. It's a visual stunner that isn't burdened with flashy CGI effects, which in itself is refreshing.\n\nCruise, who famously does most of his own stunts, shows that he's never too old to be a credible action hero. His Ethan Hunt is flawed, but that only serves to make him more relatable to the rest of us. He's one of America's last true movie stars, and he outdoes himself here. The likable supporting players (Simon Pegg, Rebecca Ferguson, Ving Rhames) are sadly still playing second fiddle, with the exception of Henry Cavill as a tagalong CIA suit.\n\nA perfect film it's not, but it's awfully easy to overlook the problems (a textbook story, the draggy length, some nonsensical plot holes, Alec Baldwin's distracting and shouty non-performance) because this movie is all about one thing: the thrilling action scenes. There are so many that are so well done it becomes impossible to choose a favorite, although I could watch the motorcycle chase through the streets of Paris and the bloody bathroom fistfight scenes once a week and never tire of the artistry in the stunt work.\n\nAnd that's what audiences will flock to see. The plot doesn't really play a significant factor in the creative (if mostly unbelievable) story, and its twists grow from \"wow, that's cool\" to ridiculous eye-rolling whoppers. No true lover of action films will care, because my review of this movie could easily be nothing more than two words: \"buckle up.\"\n\nA SCREEN ZEALOTS REVIEW",

At this stage, this is truly a pleasant surprise, and despite feeling a tad heavy on the plot exposition, it is full of so much practical stunt work and chase sequences echoing classics from 'The French Connection' to Nolan's 'Batman' series, some on-point charm and humour, and stunning location shooting, it's still a joy. In time, the extended sequence of Tom Cruise running around London's rooftops and bridges will be a staple-point in cinema. It may not carry the same ground-breaking weight as Gene Hackman driving after a train at full speed, but it is very similar to that scene in spirit, and carries in its DNA the same sense of gritted determination (As with Hackman's Doyle, you really are rooting for Ethan all the way!), as well as showing off a post-millennium London in beautiful, proud glory, so as to make for a classic moment in film history - Guaranteed!",

Furthermore, Sean Harris' Solomon Lane has improved over last time and feels like a match for the IMF. Ving Rhames is given a lot more to do in this movie and he is an absolute delight. As per usual, Simon Pegg's Bengi Dunn is delivering hilarious lines but also has a new layer of depth to him. Christopher McQuarrie proves yet again that he is the master of action filmmaking.

With Hardy capturing some spectacular wide-shots and Hamilton/McQuarrie cutting sequences together in such a way that they don't become exhausting but remain exhilarating all the way through.\n\nAs for Cruise, he is great and believable as always, but if you're looking for a deep character study, this isn't the film for you.\n\nTo sum it up: I can see some people getting turned off by the story but other than that there is no excuse not to see this film.",

The characters are one-dimensional caricatures, and the plot is driven by a series of arbitrary situations, predictably explained and then solved by our hero.  The situations, twists, and solutions are equally out of the blue and ridiculous.  The reveals in the larger plot are sadly circular and self-referential - it turns out that office politics, petty revenge, and incompetence are the main motivators.  I had some hopes for this movie because the trailer seemed to be playing up a lot of stumbles by Ethan Hunt, but that feeling didn't make it into the movie; instead he is a demi-god that can literally do any physical, mental, or skill-based task better than anyone...and that's pretty boring.

I really appreciate actors that live their characters between their bones. \n\nHowever, the story has the same plot and actually, also, the same resolution as the previous Mission Impossible movies. But, on the same side, we can say that this series of movies distinguish themselves because of the sequenced plot and resolution, in which the \"good one's\" always win the fight, or in this case, the misison. \n\nAlso I was amazed by the special effects and training of the actors, which made feel like I was on the movie. It has great image's resolution, and also it has this soundeffects that really creates an intense feeling.\n\nIn conclusion, I give 5 stars to this movie, because of the enjoyable moment it made me experience.

There is one scene where you can automatically predict how it'll turn out. However, everything was so well edited I was tricked into feeling tense anyway.\n\nDirector Christopher McQuarrie has an excellently deliberate sense of shots and pacing with both the suspense and fight scenes. The action scenes equally don't disappoint.\n\nFor a nice change of pace, the movie focuses a little more on Ethan Hunt's mindset. He finds himself going undercover with dangerous people. There's a fair amount of tension and pathos to be mined from his facing the difficulty of trying to be a good man and completing his mission in a flawed, murky world.\n\nNow I wouldn't consider these deal-breakers, but there are a couple nitpicks. The film is a bit long. Some of the action scenes do go on and on. Also, it wouldn't have hurt if the plot was a bit more streamlined. The middle does feel a little sidequestey.",

But what we did not expect was that from the get-go (opening scene) the story initiates itself like one of those big backyard fireworks you save to light till the end -- the one you spent too much for but just had to, and (slight spoiler here) all the work to reestablish the precision and virtuoso-ness of the team has king leader just walk 100ft away from the entire movies target to save the world as if it was a discarded In'N-Out Burger wrapper left on the ground. My wife and I groaned outloud, and as Kirk used to say, we then knew we were \"boldy going where no man/woman has gone before\" into a land of sheer stupidity determined by stunts and not story, and scene after scene with a total lack of storytelling (just like Infinity Wars - suppose this is what people think is good movie making today?), just a compiled cuts of mismosh predictable dialogue written by a thirteen year old, and fifteen or so actors portending that their steely fake looks into camera counts as acting? We think Tom Cruise's awesome stunts and all the planning involved distracted everyone from having a true and real story, and somehow no one noticed - not even the director apparently? - that the great question of 'why do we care' appears rarely asked in modern day action cinema; if it was, this had the visual chops and misused cast in order to make a story that keeps you in your seat no matter what! Instead I opted for a bathroom break, and another trip for ice cream and a beer, and missed nothing but sleepy and obvious dialogue by talented people sing like a sweet lullaby  . . yeah in the end and last few minutes (wife laughed \"what a climatic ending' *sarcasm) I actually fell asleep. Please save your money and miss this one in theaters; the action on a big screen does not make up for this movies 'fullout' stupity. Rent in November for $3 and be done with this trashwork. Double yawn.\nNote: I think extreme moto rider Travis Pastrana and the Nitro Circus could write better stories leading up to even better stunts",

            "content": "Not since the 1988 revival of the TV series has Mission Impossible shown its age.  The MI movies have been going at it for 22 years now-so long, in fact, that Metallica's infamous Napster lawsuit, which is forever tied to this franchise, is nearing its 20th anniversary.  Today, Tom Cruise & Ving Rhames are getting old.  Like, Roger Moore in A View to a Kill old.  It seems like the franchise might need to be revamped with a younger face once again sooner or later.  But if that were the case, then Fallout would be a pretty high note to go out on.\n\nMission Impossible 6 is one of the grittiest movies in the franchise, comparable to JJ Abrams' MI-3.  For a film series noted for its fast-paced action sequences, this one is one of the slowest as well-it puts more emphasis on the espionage and the trickery rather than the wall-to-wall action, like in other installments.  Nevertheless, there is enough intrigue going about to keep the audience gripped the whole time, plus some very interesting and unexpected twists and turns in the plot.  Not to mention that there is a \"quality over quantity\" approach to its action sequences, which make for the action sequences that do happen being true jaw-droppers to behold.\n\nRemember Ilsa Faust and the villainous Lane from the last movie?  They're back in this one, and arguably, their arcs in this one are even better than last time.  For once, we get a greater depth into Lane's character, and Ilsa has arguably the most fascinating character arc in this picture.  And then there's the other real scene-stealer: Henry Cavill as the mysterious August Walker.  Even though you can see where is arc is going at hindsight, HC executes it in a way that makes you want to see him do it.  I can't spoil much about his character, but it does take a fascinating turn.\n\nHowever, I can say this: Henry Cavill is rocking one of the sickest beards to ever grace the movie screen.  Seriously!  The next time you go to a showing of this movie, wait for the moment Henry Cavill graces the screen for the first time, and listen closely.  You could hear at least one fangirl shrieking in the theater at the mere sight of Cavill's manly mustache, combined with that neat suit that he's wearing.  He's a chick magnet of the Draco in Leather Pants variety (see TV Tropes for what that means), the kind of bad boy that'll make fangirls in the audience lose their minds when they gaze their eyes upon him.  His beard is so cool, in fact, that DC Entertainment could only shave his face with CGI for Justice League.  That's how fucking manly he looks!\n\nThen there's the climax-one of the tensest and most breathtaking climaxes in this whole series.  Never have stakes so grave been set in such a unique locale for the finale on a scale that seems so small yet actually so great.  Only one facet of this climax features grand spectacle, but the other half is literally a grungy gut-punch.  For a PG-13 flick, half of the final fight got quite dark at times, which only made the tension even higher.  It is the kind of rewarding finale that punctuates Mission Impossible 6's continuation of the franchise's hot streak after all this time.\n\nFinal verdict:\nIs Mission Impossible 6 great?  FUCK YEAH!",

Layer on top some nuanced performances, such as Vanessa Kirby as the devilishly naughty White Widow. For me, another element that cranked the tension was knowing that Tom Cruise, love or hate him as a person, does his own stunts. This cranked up the tension and added extra spice to otherwise \"impossible\" scenes. Strap yourself in to the largest, brightest 4K screen you can find and let the beautifully shot pixels work their voodoo on your cerebellum! I promise there will be no Fallout.",

Taken on its own, this movie is an incredibly entry in the world of action. Christopher McQuarrie is now adept at framing his shots and using the camera movement to add motion and kinetic energy to chase and fight scenes. Cruise, as usual, is impressive as a man constantly on the move. Henry Cavill (and his mustache) is a memorable antagonist in this entry. \n\nBut over the years, we have had to raise the bar on our expectations, not just from an action movie, but from a Mission: Impossible movie. Rogue Nation was spectacular, with smart writing and wonderful addition in Rebecca Ferguson's Ilsa. Here, the actions of John Lark don't seem to stand up to scrutiny when put alongside his goals. Throughout the movie, I was asking myself over and over \"if he wanted this to happen, then why did he do this...?\" I was hoping for a payoff, but that never came, meaning that the villain is more incompetent than he should have been. That disappointment is enough to bring my rating down a few notches. Here's hoping that the next installment is better.",

It is these moments of sudden shock and realisation, combined with stellar action and cinematography that propel the film forward. The cast, while not the life and soul of the franchise, are likeable, with Simon Pegg and Rebecca Ferguson being the standouts. As usual, Tom Cruise pulls-off another stunning real-life stunt. Also to its benefit, Fallout, unlike the other MI instalments, is more connected to the rest of the franchise, bringing back old characters and sharing plot lines with Rogue Nation. If continued, we can further invest in these characters. While Fallout doesn't bring much new to the table, it successfully delivers a gritty, fast-paced sequel with some genuinely surprising moments and an increasingly likeable cast, overcoming its now familiar formula.",

Everything you'd want from an action movie is here and then some.\nWhy don't more movies lean into themselves the way Mission Impossible does? I can't call myself a diehard action fan, a Tom Cruise enthusiast, or even someone that's seen every MI film-yet I loved every second of Mission Impossible: Fallout. There isn't a dull moment in the movie, and it doesn't seem to run out of steam at any point. At several points when you think Ethan Hunt (Cruise) has \"The Apostles\" cornered, the action ramps back up again, and the team reconvenes. When a movie is the 6th installment, like MI6, it's important the film doesn't take itself too seriously, and director Brian De Palma tiptoes that line very effectively. The cold-open was one of the best, and most fun I've ever seen in an action movie, as Cruise conspires with Wolf Blitzer to trick a terrorist into surrendering his phone using a fake newscast. When the walls to the fake hospital room raised at the end of the hijinx, there was a involuntary smile on the face of everyone in the theatre-we were in.\n\nThere a really poignant, and politically appropriate moment near the end of Mission Impossible where Ethan Hunt (Cruise) is asked if they should involve the CIA in their plan to save the world. Ethan replies bluntly \"the only people I trust are the the 4 people in this room\". There's certainly a comedic undertone to this scene-but it encapsulated how a lot of people are feeling right now on both sides of the isle in Trump's america: like they're just not sure who to trust. As with any action movie worth it's weight, MI6 features four separate twists where characters double-cross each other, and you're completely unsure who is on what side. The difference for MI: Fallout versus it's lesser counterparts is that the situations and gadgetry used are just believable enough that you could image this happening in thirty years, but not so hyper realistic that the audience gets caught in the bureaucratic weeds.\n\nThe stunts in this film are genuinely inventive, and the gut-wrenching helicopter scene is something seldom attempted in action movies. Apparently Cruise spent 2,000 hours learning to fly helicopters, and had cameras specifically designed to show he was truly the one flying the copter - and that the stunts were real during the chase. Say what you want about Tom's ego (which undoubtedly factored into that decision) but the dedication and end result were legitimately impressive.\n\nThe Good: It's really fun to spend an hour and a half with Tom Cruise for Mission Impossible: Fallout, and that's something I never imagined myself writing. The stunts are inventive, the jokes are timely and well delivered, and the plot moved quickly and deliberately though two and a half hours. Say what you want about Cruise's involvement with scientology - but the man is very good at making action flicks, transgressions aside. Rebecca Ferguson and Vanessa Kirby were also excellent is supporting roles, and probably deserved even more screen time than they got.\n\nThe Bad: As much fun as MI6 was, there's a strange and unnecessary ten minutes that seems to get added to every Cruise film, and it was again included here. These ten minutes feature a slough of beautiful women approaching Cruise while biting down on their lips with lust, and read lines borrowed from a lifetime achievement award introduction speech. In regards to MI6: it just made no sense why such a sequence was necessary-the audience had just watched a heroic helicopter chase where cruise narrowly beats a 15 second bomb clock and saves the world. We already have a deep understanding of the sexual tension between Ferguson and Cruise because of several other sequences in the movie that alluded to their past.",

But Tom Cruise has provided us with a sequence of impossible missions ever better than the other.\n\nIn fact, there is no mystery to creating the films of the serie. It's a killer cake recipe that mixes absurd scenes, twists in the script, betrayals, a simple story explained right away (almost always the good guy has to stop the villain in his attempt to dominate or destroy the world), some surprises and Tom Cruise defying death.\n\nAnd every movie your Ethan Hunt seems to be over the edge. This is how we want it. This is how we like it.\n\nThe great mystery even of \"Mission Impossible\" is like the 56 year old actor has the breath and willingness to do so much exercise! In \"Fallout Effect\", Tom Cruise runs UNBELIEFLY for London with rooftop jumps, stars in an impressive chase scene in the streets of Paris, pilots a helicopter and suffers an accident that would kill anyone in Kashmir. And still fight with Superman! All this having to climb a mountain at the end to save a third of the planet. China, India and Pakistan are grateful for their dedication.\n\nNo wonder Luther (Ving Rhames) says, \"This is my man!\" \n\n\"Fallout Effect\" is that classic spy story Hunt style. There is a traitor in the agency, you have to find a terrorist, you have to prevent plutonium bombs from killing humanity. In the midst of all this, there is the Syndicate, a group of terrorists who have been demobilized since the arrest of Solomon Lane (Sean Harris).\n\nThe situation in Washington is also not very good. The IMF is questioned after Ethan lets out the plutonium warheads to save his friends Luther and Benji (Simon Pegg). Because of this, the CIA decides to put the stick on the table and say \"now it's my way\". Thus, they recruit the mustachioed agent August Walker (Henry Cavill) to be Hunt's shadow and act more assertively on the mission.\n\nFrom there the plot develops in that climate everyone distrusts everyone. Even more so after Ilsa Faust (Rebecca Ferguson) comes full of mysteries saying she can not say anything, she can not say anything. \"But trust me.\" Ilsa, this is a world of spies. You do not even trust the shade.\n\n\"Mission Impossible: Fallout Effect\" is guaranteed fun and keeps the Ethan Hunt franchise alive. It remains to be seen how Tom Cruise will be able to take risks in ever more surreal scenes. Especially since each film seems to have to set new limits. Or keep the previous ones.",

They also did that in Rogue Nation. The editor should be fired from his job for that. No more of that in the next one. Tom Cruise still does his usual stunts and stuff but compared to Ghost Protocol and Rogue Nation, they are downplayed. Nothing tops the Dubai scene in Ghost or the Underwater scene in Rogue. The plot takes you on lots of betrayal and not knowing who to trust. They did the same thing like in Xmen Origins where they rescue some guy and then ends up not worth it at all because he goes rogue. The ending is very predictable and you know exactly what is going to happen. And the 1 on 1 battle at the end just used mostly CG and was crap compared to the finale from Mission Impossible 2. MI6 is just not that good and nothing sticks out to watch it again. The next one better be better than this.",

After all, few movie franchises succeed beyond their first three films and its main star, Tom Cruise, is now 56, a time when most people start dreaming of retirement. Yet MI: Fallout feels original, fresh and youthful, arguably the best MI movie yet.\nThe premise of the film is not too complicated - bad guys steal nuclear weapon fuel, good guys try to get it back. It's an old chestnut that has been the basis for plenty of action films, including the rival Bond series. Thankfully, MI: Fallout takes an original route, cleverly sculpting characters and elements from the preceding film (Rouge Nation) into a new storyline that explores the fallout from the actions of the Impossible Missions Force. It is sometimes hard to know who is a good guy and who is a bad guy, but there are plenty of clues hidden in the film to help you work it out.\nDirector Chris McQuarrie brings a touch of James Bond glamour to many of the scenes and Lorne Balfe has crafted a rousing music score that perfectly supports the various scenes.\nThe non-stop incredible action sequences are the heart of this movie and they will have you clutching your seat in angst. Cruise's decision to perform many of the action sequences as his own stunt double (just like he did in previous films) definitely pays off, giving plenty of realism to the film. You are left wondering if he was born without a sense of heights. The filmmakers have left the footage taken when Cruise jumped between two buildings, actually breaking his ankle on set, in the final movie. The cutaway shot of him limping away immediately afterwards is painful to watch (though not as painful as it would have been for Mr Cruise), but it just sums up how much Tom Cruise was willing to give to make this film as good as it can be.\nMission Impossible: Fallout is a great ride from start to finish. If MI: Fallout is anything to go by, it is clear there is plenty of life left in this franchise (they are up to the 26th Bond film, which is still going strong). Five stars.",

            "content": "Extremely satisfying in terms of fast-paced action and character depictions, but still an average film in terms of plot and villains - as its predecessors. Although a big fan of Tom Cruise, I did not expect at all such high Rotten Tomatoes score for this latest installment of the \"Mission Impossible\" series as I believe that it is indeed an impossible mission to renovate such a formulaic approach to the action genre and deeply traditional action hero like Ethan Hunt. It turned out that I am totally right, as the film has a hilariously confusing script full of plot-holes and over-complicated twist-and-turns that contribute nothing to character development, especially of the villains, which remain the weakest link in any \"Mission Impossible\" film. For example, Henry Cavill's character was hyped up as a worthy villain of Ethan Hunt, but his capabilities and behaviors just fluctuated throughout the film to the point that the audience could not decide whether he really is a villain of superior intellectual and physical mights or just a henchman with a mediocre skill set. Also, it is necessary to differentiate this film from an action film with intentionally simple plot (in order to solely focus on the actions) like \"Mad Max: Fury Road\", since Christopher McQuarrie did try to make this film more substantial, plot-wise, with a lengthy sub-plot about Ethan Hunt's private life, which turned out to be too cheesy to be effective, several under-developed sub-plots (about \"The Apostles\") and characters (like the \"White Widow\"), and one half-hearted utilization of the \"nuclear fallout\" motif that is only slightly correct, technology-wise, and mostly useless and illogical, also technology-wise. Of course, at the end of the day, one goes to the watch a \"Mission Impossible\" film not for its plot but for its actions and for the appearance of an ever running, ever heroic Ethan Hunt. In that aspect, this film is just a perfect choice with non-stop action sequences throughout the film until the very end in exotic and beautiful locations. To sum it up, this is indeed an excellent action film for this Summer, but could not be a new benchmark for the action genre as someone might hope after knowing its ridiculously high Rotten Tomatoes score.",

Experienced actors like Sean Harris, Ving Rhames, Angela Bassett and Alec Baldwin show even more diversity in these roles here, with Harris being a favorite of mine playing the intimidating, endlessly evil Solomon Lane, but every other actor is also very good, adding more humanizing qualities to their characters (Tom Cruise and Ferguson do an especially good job here). Although Lane is as wicked as ever, the other villain \"Lark\", whose real identity you probably won't be shocked to see, manages to be a surprisingly sympathetic villain when you truly understand his motives, you might even agree with him somewhat. Excellent, never has an action film had such interesting characters or in general been this good since 2015's Mad Max: Fury Road. Go watch this film NOW.",

It had several really good action scenes - overall the action was really good.  But the plot and story of this one - it was too complicated, it was not compelling.  I knew from the (spoiler) start, when there wasn't a good opening sequence, that something was off.  The opening sequence was slow and was just setting up the story.  Also, the cast felt a little tired because the story was lacking.  Rebecca Ferguson was used to great effect in the last MI installment.  This story tried to use her in the same way but it was not as interesting, repetitive.  Simon Pegg is excellent in everything he does, but he and Ving Rhames are becoming sort of flat characters in the franchise. I think new supporting characters would be more interesting.  Henry Cavill was a great casting choice and he was decent character but the story wasn't up to par for his character.  And in general, the motivations of the antagonists were really hard to relate to.  I hope they make more MI's but maybe do a bit of a reboot, or find a really dynamic and new story.",

            "content": "The vast majority of movie franchises suffer from diminishing returns. This Tom Cruise-led action series has avoided that common downturn by turning in ridiculously ambitious, consistently fresh and eminently exhilarating thrill rides. The sixth M:I entry, Fallout also boasts some firsts: first time a director has returned, first time the story has been directly influenced by the previous instalment, and first time a femme fatale has come back to seduce/endanger our protagonist. A big part of the franchise's success has been the revolving door of directors at the helm, each bringing their own visual style and filmmaking priorities, so it's interesting to see how Christopher McQuarrie attacks his second impossible mission behind the camera. Not surprisingly, seeing as McQuarrie has always been a more blunt-force kind of action filmmaker, this sequel is arguably the most bruising and intense. Which is no small feat for a series that has prided itself on its physical demanding set pieces. There are no less than four sequences that are genuinely jaw-dropping in their execution, featuring crunching hand-to-hand combat, an invigorating car/motorbike pursuit, an adrenaline-pumping roof-top chase on foot, and a ballsy helicopters-playing-chicken sequence beginning with an unbelievable stunt. Love him or hate him offscreen, it's getting harder to argue that Cruise isn't one of the finest showmen working in Hollywood today. His dedication to performing some of the craziest stunts committed to celluloid is admirable and, quite simply, amazing considering his age. But it wouldn't be the hugely entertaining film it is if everyone wasn't firing on all cylinders; from the pitch-perfect supporting cast (Simon Pegg's comedic sidekick, Rebecca Ferguson's MI6 agent, Henry Cavill's undiplomatic CIA henchman) to the behind the scenes crew. In fact composer Lorne Balfe deserves special mention for his left-of-field score, the use of low, haunting orchestral tunes (including a fantastic rendition of the classic M:I theme) during select sequences is a masterstroke in imbuing the movie with a certain gravitas. With everyone at the top of their game, headlined by another fervent Cruise performance, Fallout is extremely high-calibre action cinema that will feature predominantly on end-of-year 'best' lists.",

MISSION: IMPOSSIBLE - FALLOUT finds Ethan Hunt (Tom Cruise) and his IMF team (Alec Baldwin, Simon Pegg, Ving Rhames) along with some familiar allies (Rebecca Ferguson, Michelle Monaghan) in a race against time after a mission gone wrong. Henry Cavill, Angela Bassett, and Vanessa Kirby also join the dynamic cast with filmmaker Christopher McQuarrie returning to the helm.\n\nI really loved Mission: Impossible - Fallout, I missed these breathtaking action scenes this year, but finally, I found what I've been looking for for very so long, and thanks goes to Mission: Impossible - Fallout.\n\nEverything in this movie was completely amazing, except for a small leak.. and it is the script... As I said it's not big, it's just a bothering sentence is repeating every plan..\n\nLet's get started with the only thing I didn't like about this movie, and as I said it's the script. Okay, why every thing they are about to do, or planned to do, or anything to do, they just have to say \"I'll figure it out\" or \"I'm working on it\"? What? Didn't you plan for anything for this movie or something?\nThese two sentences bothered the hell out of me, actually! But it's nothing compared to everything that I loved in this movie.\n\nFirst of all, the action sequence, it's one of the best action movie of all the time! Every action scene I was like \"OMG, thank you for giving me a masterpiece in action, thank you!\". I think it's the best action movie in 2018 so far.\n\nQuickly quickly.. let's move to the performances... I loved them all! What an act-convincing?! I have no other comment about the acting, cause it was quite perfect!\n\nOh, we're not done yet, we still have the fascinating storytelling! I don't want to spoil anything, but I need to say that don't believe what you're watching, cause they will surprise you like hell!!!!\nThe story was good in every way that it could be, maybe at the beginning it didn't get my attention, but then it got my whole attention!\n\nBelieve me, no one is overreacting when he says that this movie is a masterpiece, and if you don't believe us, go and see it yourself. It will not let you down, never ever!\n\nI actually wasn't excited to watch this movie, the trailer didn't get me at all, but it did actually give me what I want, it was way better than I expected it's gonna be!\n\nOh, one more sadly thing I just remembered that I didn't like, the OST wasn't that good as it was so usual. But it wasn't so bad!\n\nI'm gonna give Mission: Impossible - Fallout an A, I think it's a magnificent movie, and definitely a worth-watching movie, I highly recommend watching this movie, guys.\n\nOkay, guys, thank you as always for reading my review, hope you like, and if you have any comment, please, say it to get improved.",

A lot of twists and turns as you would come to expect for IM films. \nMI: Fallout feels like Christopher Nolan film. Christopher Macquarie does an amazing job at replicating Nolan's style, there are points in this movie where you would be surprised that you aren't watching a Chris Nolan film.\n\nMI feels pretty old-fashioned. Lots of practical effects and sparing usage of CGI. The score also feels old-fashioned and gives us probably the best use of the mission impossible theme ever. \nMission Impossible: Fallout utilizes many locations around the world. It makes great use of its locations, all of which have a unique job in the story and unique set pieces.\n\nAnd these locations are astoundingly shown in IMAX cinematography. This is a MUST SEE in IMAX. This movie is made to be seen in IMAX. If you can't make it to an IMAX get to the biggest screen you can. The best experience for this film is in IMAX.\n\nTom Cruise' dedication to realism set this movie (and all the mission impossible movies) miles apart from other action films. Tom Cruise learnt to fly a helicopter in six weeks for this film, and not only did he had to fly the helicopter, but he also had to act and even operate the cameras as nobody else could be seen in the helicopter. Tom Cruise looked oddly older than any of his films. But this allowed for a more mature performance from Cruise. \nHenry Cavill is amazing. I believe that this is the best role to date. Though the film, unfortunately, doesn't utilize him to his fullest. \nSimon Pegg feels more like a real Hollywood actor than he had before. He was more in control of his character and in the other films he had an \"OMG I can believe I'm this movie\" feel to his performance which he seemed to have lost in this film. Which is great.\n\nYou may want to watch the previous film is you haven't already as there are lots of links to rogue nation, other than that you don't really need to have seen the other films.",

First of all, they have done a good job of hiring a different director for every single film, which means they each have their own unique feel. This movie was carrying over Christopher McQuarrie to take a second consecutive shot at directing. I didn\u2019t have any issues with his direction of Rogue Nation, but I liked the variety they attained before. Secondly, all the films up to this point have been almost complete stand-alone stories. There were a few minor references to the past, but nothing that made it necessary to know the history to enjoy the next movie. Fallout is the first that directly ties into the previous films and references them a number of times. In fact, you could almost find direct connections to all 5 previous installments in this one. I\u2019m not sure if any of this made it hard for those who aren\u2019t fans of the franchise to follow this plot, but I found myself lapping it up. It felt stand-alone, but also connected, which is hard to pull off. At this point it seems like they need to reference the history anyways, because Tom Cruise is starting to get older, despite how it may appear on screen. This is the first time I felt they played into Cruise\u2019s age just a little bit. He actually looks worn, weary, and fallible at certain times. This doesn\u2019t mean he isn\u2019t kicking butt and performing some of the most insane death-defying stunts you can imagine, because there\u2019s still plenty of that. The stunt coordinators on these films continue to astound me, as they make the action feel authentic instead of something manufactured in a machine. The bar is continually set by practical stunts, and computer animation still hasn\u2019t caught up. That\u2019s what makes Mission Impossible the gold standard when it comes to action. The story here is a little convoluted, but considering the amount of double-crossing and mistaken identity that happens in these films it is par for the course. I did find myself predicting some of the twists and turns only because I\u2019ve trained myself to expect some level of deception at any moment. The way they build tension into the story is perfect, and even when I mentally know the hero can\u2019t possibly die in an early scene, I still feel some level of concern that the movie might surprise me. The cast is all great in Fallout, including the newcomer Henry Cavill. I\u2019m such an avid fan of this franchise that I wish they would start grooming the next generation star who has an insane taste for risking his/her life to replace Tom Cruise. We\u2019ll see if it ever gets to that point, but for now, I\u2019m still enjoying the adventures, and I\u2019m astounded that at this point it seems Mission Impossible has found a way to completely steal the spy film spotlight from James Bond.",

            "content": "Mission: Impossible - Fallout (the 6th movie of the ongoing movie series) is a great example of what an action movie should be. Tom Cruise once again impresses fans across the globe, by doing every stunt by himself without the help of a 'stunt double'. Other cast members such as Simon Pegg, Rebecca Ferguson, Ving Rhames, Sean Harris and Alec Baldwin are very good at playing their roles aswell. For me personally, I find this film the absolute best of the famous M:I collection. The action never slows down, and speaking of action - that bathroom fight scene was epic in so many ways. Props to the director/whoever helped to make Fallout, because I have now declared it to be my favourite movie of 2018 (so far) with Avengers: Infinity War being second. Can't wait to see what's planned for the future!",

Being a fan of action films such as the Bourne series, the Bond series, and especially the mission series, this film holds up as one of the best. Tom Cruise is simply on another level with work ethic that you do not see anymore. He learned to fly a freaking helicopter for a chase sequence, he jumped out of a plane at 25000 feet, and also broke his ankle performing a jump. He is nuts! The film if you follow the series picks up as a continuation of the 5th film as most of the characters return with the exception of Renner. The plot was deep felt no matter how silly some of the sequences got. We really see some tight relationships on the screen that does had some heart to the film. The film never ever let up, and had sequences that rank up there with the dubai scene. I also want to say Henry Cavill exceeded expectations here. He was fantastic and very believable. He also kicked major tail. This movie is the ULTIMATE popcorn fun with an edge to it. Its what Michael Bay wishes he could be. At the end of the day Cruise is what ties the film together. His bold presence, his stunt work and dedication to the role puts the bow on the box. A near perfect action film that could be one of the genres best in some time.",

            "content": "'Mission Impossible: Fallout' is directed by Christopher McQuarrie who previously directed 'Rogue Nation.' This is the first instalment of the franchise in which a director has returned, and it has proved to be an excellent decision.  McQuarrie has taken everything that has worked within the series, as he did in 'Rogue Nation,' and escalated it. The stunning action set pieces the series has become known for are combined with refined emotional stakes in 'Fallout.' McQuarrie is clearly aware that intense action is not intense without the audience being emotionally invested in the characters. \n\nThe stakes in 'Fallout' are ridiculously high involving a nuclear threat, which we as audience members have become accustomed to, yet McQuarrie keeps the story rooted within character, bringing the film above other generic action films with 'end of the world' scenarios. Sean Harris's brilliantly menacing 'Solomon Lane' makes the threat personal to Tom Cruise's 'Ethan Hunt.' This personal element is escalated with the return of Michelle Monaghan reprising her role from J.J. Abrams's 'Mission Impossible: 3' who is at the heart of the story from the very opening shot. McQuarrie has created the most emotionally intense film of the series by developing its characters before placing them within the action. Rebecca Ferguson, returning as 'Isla Faust' from 'Rogue Nation' is given a rivetingly unpredictable role. Simon Pegg and Ving Rhames also reprise their roles. Although underused, Rhames has a surprisingly emotional dialogue scene, increasing the tension in proceeding action scenes involving his character. The film is set up unpredictably in a way which means you actually feel the characters are at real risk. And of course, Tom Cruise gives a fittingly vulnerable, strong performance as Ethan Hunt especially in scenes involving Monaghan's character and in interactions with Sean Harris as 'Lane' and of course within the thrilling action sequences he is at the centre of.\n\nThe jaw-dropping action sequences are made jaw-dropping due to their practicality. Cruise has shockingly topped the C-17 stunt in 'Rogue Nation' with a terrifyingly brilliant helicopter sequence filmed using IMAX cameras, performed for real in typical Tom Cruise fashion. The Paris motorcycle sequence is so intense it is difficult to watch, yet you won't be able to take your eyes of the screen. What makes these action scenes is that the stunts are combined with perfect camerawork. McQuarrie is not attempting to imitate the fitting shakiness of 'Bourne' as J.J. Abrams tried unsuccessfully in 'Mission Impossible: 3.' He is doing the opposite. The camera is placed within the action and showcases the stunts in all their glory, following objects/characters or even being attached to them. There is a stand-out action sequence in a bathroom which is far more grounded than larger scaled stunts within the film, yet it is made just as intense, maybe more so, through stunning choreography and the casting of 'Liang Yang.' His menacing facial expressions alone elevate the intensity of the sequence. Unusual for hand-to-hand combat film sequences, you feel the impacts of every punch. This feeling of impact is obviously brought out through the choreography, but is also heightened with sound design. Every punch is brutally heard. Every gunshot is joltingly loud. In contrast, McQuarrie has also used silence in moments of action, most notably as a result of a lightning strike during the nail-biting H.A.L.O jump sequence, and in a brilliant one-take shootout sequence in order to give it the surreal feeling it required. \n\nFurthermore, there are quieter scenes of tension throughout created by performances and writing. The writing is often predictable, and is no 'Usual Suspects,' also written by Christopher McQuarrie, yet it is often very good in terms of creating tension. A scene which stood out for me was one involving a French policewoman for its tension. Humour is also cleverly balanced with tension and darkness, especially evident in this scene - a scene of initial humour which unfolds into extreme tension and weightiness. \n\nIn conclusion, 'Fallout' is the best entry in the series yet with its culmination of incredible stunt work, performances and a personal story to the characters which serves to heighten the intensity.",

As the release date looms the anticipation builds up to the point where it's too high to ever be met, and you can't help but be a tiny bit disappointed when finally viewing it. It takes some time pondering and a good step back to see it's full beauty. For me in the last few years only two highly anticipated films have not fallen victim to this phenomenon, impressing from the opening credits to the end credits pulverising expectations and snatching breath away before one can gasp. The first was Blade Runner 2049 and the second is Mission: Impossible Fallout. \n\nNever has a modern action film (let alone a sequel in an inconsistent franchise) confounded my expectations and defied the limits of what an action film can achieve. It's incredible, thrilling, chilling and gorgeous to look at. From the shadowy and clandestine opening that recalls the cold-war shadowplay of the original. The slick extended shots of action sequences and dialogue and stunning action beats to quieter moments where we get to pause for a half breath and soak in the beauty of the many locations they shot in to the final much lauded helicopter sequence. This is a movie that just keeps on giving. From Halo jumps to bruising fist fights to bike chases, car chases, foot chases shoot outs and finally dangling below a helicopter before climbing up inside it (for real too) to chase a second helicopter through snow capped mountain ranges (New Zealand doubling as Kashmir) and that's just the action! \n\nIt also contains some of the most layered characterisation of any M:I film a coherent plot and chilling villian(s). Not to mention the female representation. M:I has Ironically managed to do over the last 4 films what Bond has not been able to do over 24 films. Create strong, independent woman with their own motivations and convictions capable and self reliant for the most part while still managing to knock 'em dead in a evening gown when required. They threaten to steal the show as does Henry Cavill in his hulking intimidating and unstoppable yet still charming form. It manages to pay homage to the best parts of the previous entires even better than Rogue Nation did and land the 3rd act better than Rogue Nation did too while loosing the \"cutesy\" tone of the previous two for a grittier more grounded approach with real stakes this time. Reverting to 35mm as a shooting format is also a welcome return, rendering a beautifully filmic image that appears natural yet embellishing in all the right places. \n\nI struggled to like Rogue Nation as much as I wanted to. The tone was something I couldn't reconcile and the action wasn't as Polished and well staged as I'd hoped and the film lost its motivation somewhere after the final bike chase. Fallout rectifies this and then some. It's not only the best M:I to date it's potentially the best action blockbuster ever -and that's saying something. The real Impossible Mission (should they choose to accept -(sorry)) will be topping this with the next entry. Good luck though. Highest recommendation.",

            "content": "Coming down from the surging adrenaline rush, I was trying to determine when was the last time an action movie made me feel the immersive, delirious highs that Mission: Impossible - Fallout offers in spades, and what I came up with 2015's Mad Max: Fury Road. Simply put, this is the best straightforward action movie in three years. It's the best Mission: Impossible movie in the series, which, if it hadn't already, has assumed the peak position of the most consistent, most entertaining, and best action franchise in Hollywood. Allow me to explain how returning writer/director Christopher McQuarrie (Jack Reacher) makes an action movie that demolishes the competition.\n\nEthan Hunt (Tom Cruise) has been pulled back into spy action thanks to the lingering fallout (eh, eh?) of the capture of Solomon Lane (Sean Harris), whose followers, nicknamed The Apostles, have stolen three plutonium cores. It's Ethan Hunt's fault the nuclear cores got loose, and so he and his team, Luther (Ving Rhames) and Benji (Simon Pegg), must clean up after their mess. The CIA sends its own asset, the burly August Walker (Henry Cavill), to help oversee the mission and specifically Ethan Hunt, who must pose as a shadowy terrorist broker to maintain appearances with important figures in the criminal underworld. In order to get the nuclear parts, Ethan Hunt has to retrieve Solomon Lane and release him back into the open. Complicating matters further is Ilsa Faust (Rebecca Ferguson) who needs Solomon dead to clear her own spy debts.\n\nEvery action movie lives or dies depending upon its unique set pieces, often the first thing constructed by a studio and then the plot mechanics are ladled on merely as the barest of connecting tissue. They need to have stakes, they need to have purpose, they need to be memorable, and they need to be understood and develop organically. Mission: Impossible - Fallout could be taught in filmmaking schools about how to properly build action set pieces. They are brilliant. McQuarrie finds interesting ways to set them up, complicate them, and just keep the escalation going in a manner that still maintains the believability of the moment. Take for instance a foot chase where Ethan Hunt is trying to nab a bad guy through downtown London. Where McQuarrie pushes into the extraordinary is by having that foot chase on a multi-level terrain. Ethan Hunt has to chase after his target but multiple stories above the ground, and so he's leaping out windows, jumping over rooftops simply to keep up. It's a simple twist that takes what we're familiar with and, literally, elevates it to new heights. Or take for instance the mission in Paris to capture Solomon Lane. At first it's capture, then it's flee police, then it's flee another assassin. There are multiple stages to this sequence, each with a new goal, each with new complications, and each with new eye-popping stunts and escapes. The action finds natural points to progress, making smart use of the geography, and keeping different elements at play to come in and out to add more problems. This is how you do action right. As soon as the half-hour mark settles in with the arrival of Walker, the movie is practically nonstop in its set pieces until the very end. At a steep 147 minutes, this is the longest Mission: Impossible movie yet but it's breathless in its execution.\n\nAmazing set pieces that are cleverly designed is one aspect of a great action movie, but if you can't tell what's going on, what's the point of all that cleverness? Fortunately, McQuarrie understands this and adheres to a visceral depiction of the action that creates gloriously immersive and pulse-pounding sequences. The set pieces are terrific, so it stands to reason the stuntwork should be terrific, and to make sure you appreciate the stuntwork, McQuarrie makes sure the photography highlights the verisimilitude. It's a symbiotic (or as the Venom trailer tells me, \"sym-BI-oat-ic\") relationship but when done correctly, as evidenced in this film, it's the key to truly kinetic action sequences. Take for instance a parachute jump that marks the start of the second act. McQuarrie films it as a sustained long take, and as the camera plummets to the ground chasing after the two men, our brains can tell us that there is some special effects trickery to mitigate the dangers, but our senses are overwhelmed with the sustained illusion of tension. The fight choreography is equally up to the challenge. A bathroom brawl with Ethan Hunt and Walker and another man becomes a lesson in how many things can be smashed and what can be used as a weapon. A high-speed motorcycle chase through Parisian streets gets even more frantic when Ethan Hunt drives against traffic, and the scene becomes even more exciting when McQuarrie's lens allows us to see the danger in all its glory.\n\nThe Mission: Impossible franchise has been notable for its insane stuntwork but also, chiefly after the second installment, its edict to practical effects and maintaining the believability of its reality. It's still movie spy shenanigans and globetrotting adventures, yes, but the moment-to-moment thrills feel like they're really happening. The Fast and Furious franchise has gained great acclaim for the bombast of its physics-defying spectacle, and the Mission: Impossible franchise seems to have gone purposely in the opposite direction. It's real Tom Cruise jumping off that building, it's real Tom Cruise riding through traffic on a motorcycle, and it's real Tom Cruise falling and climbing up a speeding helicopter during the thrilling finale. Cruise has had a death wish when it comes to throwing himself into the high-wire stunts of his franchise, but even at 56 years old he's still at it, essentially trying to commit suicide on film for all of our amusement. Cruise is one of the few remaining movie stars and his commitment is without question.\n\nThis is also the first Mission: Impossible film that feels like the characters matter. It's a direct continuation from the previous film, 2015's Rogue Nation, bringing back the (somewhat lackluster) villain, the newest spy counterpart/potential love interest, the CIA and IMF brass, and the essential supporting team members from prior engagements. Because of this it feels more like what happened previously was establishment for a new story building upon that foundation. Rather than starting all over, the characters find ways to deepen their relationships, and the film opens up Ethan Hunt as a character and the toll his duty takes on those closest to him. There are some nice quiet moments that examine these characters as actual people. Several complications are as a direct result of personal character decisions, some good and some bad. I was joking with my pal Ben Bailey beforehand about wondering whether they'd find a way for Ving Rhames to matter, since he hasn't been much more than \"a guy in the van\" for four movies, and by God they make him matter. They make each team member matter, finding moments to give them, mini-goals they're entrusted with. During the dizzying helicopter chase in the finale, supporting players are left with their own task. Luther has to defuse a bomb but doesn't have enough hands. Benji has to find something valuable in a very needle-haystack situation designed to torment and waste precious time. Ilsa is at cross-purposes for most of the film, not wanting to harm her fellow allies but also being given her own orders to prove her loyalty and protect her future. All of this comes to a head and it makes the parts feel as important as the whole. That's great storytelling.\n\nLet's talk about that million-dollar mustache of Cavill's. It was a year ago that Justice League re-shoots required Cavill and the Mission: Impossible team refused to allow their actor to shave his mustache, thus leading to that unsettling fake baby lip Superman was sporting in a majority of his scenes in the haphazard Justice League film. I just read an AV Club interview with McQuarrie where he for the first time discusses the whole mustache brouhaha and apparently Paramount estimated that it would have cost them three million for the effects to uphold Cavill's upper lip continuity. Warner Brothers refused to pay up and so went down that ill-fated CGI mustache-removing route. It was shortly afterwards that Cruise shattered his ankle in a roof-leaping stunt (that is in the finished film and advertisements) and the production had to shut down for a month. If only Warner Brothers had waited, perhaps we all could have avoided this mustache mess.\n\nMission: Impossible - Fallout is a new highpoint for the best action franchise going in movies today (I'm still waiting for a third Raid film, Gareth Evans). The set pieces are memorable and unique, leading from one into the next with exquisite precision and thought. The action sequences are stunning and shot with stunning photography, highlighting the stunning stuntwork by the best death-defying professionals. It's the first Mission: Impossible movie that doesn't climax at its middle; in fact there's a pretty obvious reveal that feels like it was going to be a late Act Three twist, but McQuarrie recognizes the audience thinking ahead, and there's like a whole other exciting 45 minutes after. The stakes are better felt because the characters matter and are integrated in meaningful ways. This is the most I've enjoyed Henry Cavill in a movie (with possible exception of another spy movie, Man From U.N.C.L.E.), and you know what, his mustache works too. While the vertigo-inducing Burj Khalifa sequence is the best set piece in the franchise, Fallout has everything else beat at every level. Mission: Impossible - Fallout is a reminder that there are few things in the world of cinema better than a properly orchestrated, properly filmed, and properly developed action movie operating at full throttle. This is one of the reasons why we go to the movies, folks. See it in IMAX if possible. Soak it up.\n\nNate's Grade: A",

I was pumped for the most part of the film which had really memorable and outstanding action sequences that blew me away. I can see alot of the film really tried hard with the stuntwork and it was amazingly well brought. the story is alright but it doesn't deliver anything new to the franchise and is something we've seen for a while. The cast however is really great like Simon Pegg who plays Benji, Vin Rhames as Luther and everyone does a pretty outstanding job in their acting especially Henry Cavill who plays August Walker without that CGI moustache lol and I though he was great though he kind of l from his character a little but was great as the villain as seen in the trailers. From Start to finish, Mission Impossible: Fallout does whatever it can to be perfect and it is, really top notch stuntwork, performances were great, loved the cast, action sequences were breathtaking, and I totally would recommend especially in the IMAX format though sadly only 2 scenes were shot with it but still, definitely a thrill ride.",

It was too long and incredibly slow in parts, to the point where I lost interest on a number of occasions. The acting from some of the support characters was weak and wooden, and the screenplay could have been much stronger. Many of the action scenes (chases, running, etc) were repetitive, and I felt like there was very little new material here. Compared to previous films, there wasn't the same level of complexity and plot twists that we are used to. Yes the cinematography is good the film finally found some dramatic tension towards the end, but that was too little too late. For me, this is the weakest of the MI films to date. MC",

On the surface, this sixth entry in its high-octane, fast-paced, yet patiently-conceived, thrill-fest of a franchise is a rocket launcher with enough firepower to skyrocket any action junkie into divine explosive sensations of adrenalized intoxication. However, this astronomical energy is further complimented by a rich dosage of both character value and transparency. This movie manages, in an admirable fashion, to project the weight of the struggles, emotions, decisions, and consequences of its characters in a manner that feels genuinely substantial and even palpable to the audience -- a very rare feat to such extent in an action blockbuster. Here, the filmmakers want these characters to be understood as people instead of just being applauded for looking cool, and the distinct effectiveness of these efforts is solidified through three main aspects: 1) the ultimate threat against humanity in the film, the sheer scope of destruction and terror infused in it, is heavily based in reality to where the uprising of a similar danger in our modern society is entirely believable; 2) the characters are individually and cohesively motivated to save people simply for the sakes of humanity and their loved ones rather than be coerced by a stereotypical call-to-arms scenario (revenge, rescuing the damsel in distress, etc.); and 3) the movie quickly and clearly establishes that failure is a definite possibility, presenting a whole new, fully-loaded tension tablet for the audience to swallow. In short, the movie honorably convinces its audience that there are deeper reasons to care for these characters and the outcomes of their missions......which is more than can be said for most movies of a similar caliber. Movies like this are noteworthy and prove that action blockbusters can be much more than fluffy, explosive, popcorn, summer money-makers.",

The stunts he performs are astounding, he continues to do ridiculous things for our entertainment. Cruise knows his character like the back of his hand, he plays the IMF agent so effortlessly; there simply isn't anyone else better to be the star of your movie in this blockbuster-driven world. The rest of the cast is also awesome with many returning names such as Simon Pegg, Ving Rhames, Alec Baldwin, Rebecca Ferguson, and Sean Harris as the infamous Solomon Lane. Meanwhile new names Henry Cavill and Angela Bassett slide in perfectly to the franchise. \nThere are so many positive things to say about this movie. The plot kept me on the edge of my seat the entire time, I could never predict what would happen next, I never knew who to trust; there were always twists and turns around the corner. The set-pieces are as crazy and thrilling as ever, this movie is action at its finest. Want a great fight scene? Or what about a shootout? Or a car chase? Or even better, a helicopter chase? In every aspect this movie delivers. The villains are strong and can hold their own; Solomon Lane, while in a more reserved role, is still as menacing as ever. While the \"stop the nuclear weapons from going off\" plot isn't wholly original, the movie is able to keep it fresh through adding its own sophistication and nuance to it. I really liked Ghost Protocol, so I have trouble saying this is the best of the franchise, but regardless, this is a great action movie. \nYour mission, if you choose to accept it, is to make sure you see this movie in theaters because I know I may have to see this one a second time it was so awesome.",

The usual.\"\n\nThis isn't just the second to last dialogue exchange in \"Mission: Impossible: Fallout\"; it's also a summary of the preceding two and a half hours. If ever there was a typical \"Mission: Impossible\" movie-the template of which was forged nearly a quarter century ago-this is it. \"Fallout,\" much like \"Rogue Nation\" before it, seems determined to stay completely inside the lines set and maintained by its fellow \"Mission\" brethren, as well as other spy-action movies. In fact, of \"Rogue Nation,\" I had written: \"...the movie left me feeling cautious and uncertain about future 'M:I' installments...Cruise and the filmmakers seem willing to water down and re-use the plots on which the action and stunts hang. I'm not sure how long this approach can go on.\" Unfortunately, \"Fallout\" confirms to me it cannot go on any longer, or at least it shouldn't (I'm sure the movie will still be a huge financial success), and it's the first \"Mission\" movie I can't justifiably recommend.\n\nIt tears me up inside to write such words, because as a series of technical exercises and highly elaborate stunt sequences, \"Fallout\" is stupendous and exceptional, and often the best of its kind. On paper, its ambitions as a spy thriller, at least as far as spectacle, should have yielded quite the mesmerizing movie-going experience. But oddly enough, as a movie doesn't feel experiential. It plays as more of a model that future second unit directors, stunt coordinators, and editors might study in order learn how to seamlessly execute action sequences of the highest caliber and complexity. From an academic point of view, I would recommend it hands down, but from a narrative one, I needed more than just the standard \"Mission\" plot to engage me.\n\nSpeaking of the plot, if the film's closing dialogue summed it up as \"the usual,\" then the opening scene, in not so explicit of words, essentially promises the same thing. During the trademark, \"This is your mission, should you choose to accept it\" encrypted recording, spy/agent Ethan Hunt (Tom Cruise) receives word that members of the terrorist organization known as the Syndicate, led by the now-captured but still very dangerous Solomon Lane (Sean Harris) and which Hunt sought to prove the existence of in \"Rogue Nation,\" have recently resurfaced and formed a new faction called The Apostles. They are partnering with a faceless zealot named John Lark, who has written a manifesto that outlines a fanatical plan to wipe the Earth clean of corruption and sin in order to begin it anew. It's your typical megalomaniacal scheme, which will begin with Lark contaminating enough of the world's water supply to eliminate one-third of the planet's population.\n\nTo carry out this annihilation, Lark has tasked the Apostles with acquiring three plutonium cores, which he'll use to make a nuclear bomb that will detonate atop the mountains surrounding Pakistan, India and China. That is, unless Hunt and his trusted Impossible Mission Force (IMF) team-Luther Stickell (Ving Rhames) and Benji Dunn (Simon Pegg)-can intercept the cores first. And indeed they have the chance, but during a tense exchange at the beginning of the film, Hunt must choose between obtaining the cores and saving a member of his own team's life, and in the end, his teammate wins out, leaving the cores, as they say, \"in the wind.\"\n\nSo what was once a seemingly straightforward mission becomes, yet again, a most complicated operation that takes Hunt and his cohorts all over the world, from Belfast to Paris to London, and eventually Kashmir, as they attempt to retrieve the plutonium and prevent three nuclear bombs from going off. And if you think things won't boil down to the last possible millisecond, complete with a red digital readout, then you're obviously not familiar with \"the usual\" \"Mission\" devices.\n\nUsual or not, one of the elements that has always kept the \"Mission\" movies grounded is the humanity and likability of the characters, and both of those are in full swing here, despite the absurdity of the plot. In fact, it's Hunt's decision to spare one human life at the potential cost of millions that IMF Secretary Alan Hunley (Alec Baldwin, now so hard to imagine not as Donald Trump) finds so admirable about him. The same cannot be said of CIA Director Erica Sloane (Angela Bassett), who doesn't trust the IMF and insists her own agent, Augustus Walker (Henry Cavill), accompany Hunt when he must parachute from high above Paris to meet the mysterious White Widow (Vanessa Kirby) at the Grand Palais. She's supposedly the broker between John Lark and the Apostles, but one of the running themes throughout the \"M:I\" movies is that, aside from the good guys, nobody really is who they say are. The reveal of each character's actual identity and loyalty is so common a ploy in this series that it's fairly easy to guess who will come out either as a savior or as a double-crosser, and the fact that it is so easy now dilutes some of the fun.\n\nStill, the movie does have a consistent momentum, and to writer-director Christopher McQuarrie's credit (he's the only filmmaker to helm two \"Mission\" movies following \"Rogue Nation\"), he doesn't dumb things down, and the standard labyrinthine plot set by the original \"Mission\" continues here. But again, because such a quality has become so routine, it simply doesn't render the same effect it once did. Because we anticipate the narrative being overstuffed and convoluted, \"Fallout\" merely meets our expectations instead of going beyond them. \n\nThe same goes for the otherwise incredible stunts and action sequences, which range from the aforementioned skydive; an intense martial arts fight in a night club men's room; a motorcycle/car chase on the narrow streets of Paris; a full-throttle run across the rooftops of London; and a superior dual helicopter battle over snow-capped mountains. Each of these is executed with great vigor, detail, and conviction, and had they been the first of their kind, \"Mission: Impossible: Fallout\" might have been one of the most memorable action movies in recent memory. However, as extreme, sensational and uncompromising as these sequences are, the fact remains they are not original, but simply performed to a greater degree than what we've seen before. The movie essentially takes what other action movies (including previous \"M:I\" movies) have done and pumped them full of steroids, and I needed it do more than just beef things up.\n\nTo give you an idea, the bathroom fight, right down to the lighting design, feels like it was yanked right out of \"True Lies,\" while the Paris chase mirrors a similar sequence in \"The Bourne Identity.\" Meanwhile, as Hunt sprints across a series of roofs in London, I couldn't help but recall him sprinting at the end of \"M:I:III\" in much the same way.\n\nSo unfortunately, the film's \"usualness\" (both with regard to its plot and its action), ends up costing it too much excitement value. Don't get me wrong-I fully recognize the filmmakers' technical prowess, as well as Cruise and company's ceaseless and enthusiastic dedication, but the hackneyed material ultimately undermines them and I left the theater feeling mostly underwhelmed.\n\nStill, even though \"Fallout\" didn't marvel me like I hoped, it did leave me hopeful, because I'm confident this same team of filmmakers and actors can apply their energy and resources to fresher, more worthy material. This should be their mission going forward, so let's hope they choose to accept it.",

            "content": "As most people out there already know, I love my movies and am always champing at the bit to check out the latest blockbuster.\n\nTonight was no exception, as we cruised in to the ACE Cinemas to view the latest instalment in the Mission Impossible franchise.\n\nThis version was like a multi-faceted diamond where each facet shined boldly beyond belief.\n\nThe first aspect that was worthy of mention was the return the very cool cast, in Tom Cruise, Ving Rhames and Simon Pegg playing the parts of legendary Ethan Hunt, Luther Stickell and Benji Dunn.\n\nAlso returning was the potential love interest for Ethan in Rebecca Ferguson as Lisa.\n\nThe producers also enlisted the services of the latest screen Superman, Henry Cavill. He did a great job in adding some machismo manliness so as to try and rival Ethan's alpha dominance.\n\nAlec Baldwin is always a welcomed addition to any cast and was convincing as Ethan's boss, albeit in somewhat of a cameo appearance.\n\nThe second facet that shone was the plot. Which this time around involved a terrorist by the name of Solomon Lane, who with a bunch of his so-called 'Apostles', was trying to acquire enough Plutonium to create a nuclear catastrophe that would bring civilisation to its knees. His philosophy was that \"peace on Earth cannot truly be achieved without great suffering first\"! There were the usual twists and turns we've come to expect in MI flicks as well as the par for the course backstabbing, double-crossing and even triple-crossing that spy stories seem to thrive on. The only problem with this is that in the past the MI stories have been somewhat confusing and with that a tad frustrating. The confusion on this occasion was there, but thankfully nowhere near as bad.\n\nThe third facet of these movies that never fails to disappoint is the intense action that has you on the edge of your seat from go to woe. And with that, I take my hat off to fifty-something year old Sir Thomas Cruise, for defying father-time with more of his amazing stunts and cleverly coordinated fight scenes. Whatever his Endocrinologist has prescribed for him, I want me some of that!!!\n\nThe frantic facet of this film which was fantastic were the superb chase scenes that involved motorbikes, cars, trucks, helicopters and of course that inimitable running technique of Tom's, where you swear he's going to do himself an injury with the way those pointed fingers go perilously close to his eye sockets as his arms go up and down like human pistons!!\n\nAs a fan of BMW automobiles, it was also nice to see them clearly sponsoring Mission Impossible with some of their magnificent M-Series vehicles, R nine T Scrambler motorcycles and my favourite, the classic 750iL Saloon!!\n\nThe fifth facet that for me was the most fascinating was the way the cinematographers masterfully used the art of filming iconic buildings, cultural structures, unique camera angles and majestic landscapes from around the world to enhance the whole viewing experience. This artistry was not something you would normally expect in an action blockbuster, but it was so craftily embedded that it kind of snuck up on you as the film progressed. By the end you realised that, not only were you fatigued from the all the suspense and action, but you were simultaneously super-impressed by the sheer visual splendour!\n\nThe final facet that cannot be understated is the marvellous music that we've all loved since the iconic TV series started back in the late 1960's. The musical directors have obviously tweaked it slightly with some clever remixes, but it was nice to hear some of the original theme music too.\n\nIn closing, all I can say is...\n\n\"Your mission, if you choose to accept it, is to get your ass into the cinemas to watch this spectacle, before it self-destructs and heads off to DVD!!!\"\n\nCW's rating this time around...4 and 1/2 stars ??????????",

You thought scaling the Burj Al Khalifa, Infiltrating the Kremlin and CIA, and generally kicking arse on every continent in the previous MI`s wasn't enough? You`d be right, wouldn't you? Sure, when you step into the cinema to see the latest MI you`re not expecting Tarantino`s intricate dialogue, nor Nolan`s cinematic artistry. You come expecting Tom Cruise doing what he does best: explosions, double crosses, car chases, iconic villains and a myriad of exotic locations, not forgetting those bloody masks!. And it delivers on all of these, especially the masks! So ver many masks.. And yet, and yet I feel they really dropped the ball on this one. The sheer preposterousness of it all. Case in point: Ethan and Henry Cavill have to get to Paris to stop a meeting between two people (don't ask who the people are I still don't have a clue!). Instead of buying them a couple of Easyjet tickets from London and a taxi from De Gaulle, the CIA or IMF or is it MI6? Decide to parachute them in from 25000 feet, if that wasn't bad enough they neglected to check the weather forecast as there was a lighting storm going on to add to the `drama`.\nThis ridiculous formula continues throughout the film, as Hunt constantly neglects to do the obvious logical things in order to achieve his `objectives`. This comes to its apex at the climax of the film as Hunt squares off against the baddies number one henchman, its mano e mano, Hunt needs to get the special device the henchman has! And Hunt makes such a task infinitely more difficult because he forgot to bring his gun along with him, really? Bond and Bourne surely wouldn't make such a rookie mistake. Verdict: a total lack of originality, an absence of humour and clarity all combine to bring you the weakest instalment of the franchise. Next time Ethan please remember to bring your gun.",

Maybe if Tom jumped the fountain at Caesar's Palace on a motorcycle you might be impressed, probably not though, you would find a way. Mi6 stands up well regardless of the stupid one star ratings that the disenfranchised gave. I believe it was 2015 me and my teenage son went to see Mad Max Fury Road, we were like wow that was insane and it had crazy stunts too down in the outback, a raw and entertaining action movie. Walking out of the theater from this Mad Max movie people were talking and a black lady by herself middle-aged or so and she commented to herself that was terrible. I looked at my son and I said if the movie was so terrible, and it was raw, why didn't she leave the movie theater much sooner ? She could have left well before the halfway point instead of watching the whole thing. MI6 is definitely a good action movie and it stands up well with the characters and dialogue. If this genre of movie does not excite you then go watch something else. No MI6 will not displace Gone With the Wind on the all-time movie list but it was never intended to. if you enjoy a great action movie watch MI6 in IMAX or an upscale home theater system ",

The action and thrills here best even the exhilarating \"Ghost Protocol\", and the beautiful camerawork packs as much punch as possible into every ounce of it. The film is relentlessly suspenseful, and the characters on both sides of this fight are executed amazingly by their respective actors; the story makes great use of this, too, providing some of the most emotionally intense writing since the third entry. The story does harken back to the initial film's complexity and tone, but in a way that respects the franchise while the other elements innovate it. The final product here cannot be overstated; it's the best action film since Mad Max: Fury Road, and without a doubt the definitive blockbuster of the year.",

And with Fallout, McQuarrie and Cruise have delivered easily their most impossible (and best) mission yet. A globe trekking, twisting-and-turning, intensely exciting sequel that continues and expands the reigning power of this unlikely blockbuster franchise.\nOnce again, Hunt and his crew find themselves amid a potential global disaster, on the outs with their own government and the criminal underground. What sets this one apart is its story and plot connections with the previous films. Where the others are essentially stand-alone outings, letting you jump in where you please, this one requires you to have a modicum of knowledge on Hunt and his exploits, allowing for growth in characters and stronger stakes in the villain's mysterious plots. \nAs expected, there are an endless number of great reveals that beautifully unravel information only when necessary. Thanks to some stellar editing, it's predictable when it isn't important, and unpredictable when it is, making the mysteries and the marquee action scenes that much more impacting.\nHonestly, God bless Tom Cruise and his lack of self-preservation. At 52, he is one of the last true action stars who sells a movie purely by putting his name on it, thanks largely to his renown for doing his own action. And with bathroom fist fights, helicopter chases, and skydiving malfunctions, what action it is. I always think this should be the last Mission with Cruise before seeing the most recent outing; by the end I just want more.",

Full blast action, excellent car chases, etc from the beginning to the very end. Naturally there are scenes which defy the laws of physics, but for action's sake we'll accept them. Tom is, once again, at his very best. It's really incredible that he doesn't use stuntmen for any of the action scenes.

            "content": "There\u2019s obviously a working relationship between Tom Cruise and director Christopher McQuarrie, this being their third project together after the previous M:I - Rogue Nation and the first Jack Reacher. Both films I was very impressed with overall, especially the action sequences and I certainly wasn\u2019t disappointed here, which makes me hope this relationship continues should the saga expand, which I\u2019m sure it will. Ethan Hunt is back on the trail of trying to eliminate the shadowy, terrorist organisation, The Syndicate following on from Rogue Nation. There\u2019s the obvious threat to humanity and no one\u2019s seems to be able to stop it, or even want to stop it, apart from Ethan Hunt and the remaining IMF team. All sounds pretty standard for espionage spy actioners but there\u2019s a couple of little clever twists and conflict of interest, even if quite predictable. The team is much of the same characters we should all be familiar with, the story again overlooks the absence of past members like Jeremy Renner\u2019s Brandt, repeating what Rogue Nation did with Paula Patton\u2019s Jane. However the addition of Henry Cavill\u2019s Walker is a welcome change, but does he do fill the boots of being Hunt\u2019s opposite and likely looming threat. He sure is the hammer to Hunt\u2019s scalpel but I found him a little underwhelming and not menacing enough with this being the only weakness of the story. Personally, I wished they developed his character a lot more but maybe I\u2019m asking too much. I was pleased to see Vanessa Kirby after watching her in the low budget Kill Command. Her character of the double-sided, trickster fence was more intriguing than Cavill\u2019s Walker. The action is sharp and often brutal with some of the best, slickest sequences of the entire series. Especially with Cruise\u2019s impressive stunt work which seems to be the foundation of this film\u2019s hype. Believe me, the hype is real and it\u2019s action-packed from start to finish with some little moments of heart; there is one scene where I thought Cruise was going to break into Jerry Maguire\u2019s \u201chelp me, help you!\u201d It doesn\u2019t let up hitting the audience hard and fast with fights, car chases, van chases, motorbikes, parachute jumps and helicopters. It ticks all the boxes for what makes a great action film great. This is a fest in itself for being the longest in the franchise. But, it\u2019s downgraded it\u2019s outrageous scenarios, excluding the grand finale. And this was actually very refreshing. There\u2019s no scaling of the Burj Khalifa, no free diving down a giant urinal or sliding down a glass building and dodging missiles. It\u2019s as if they wanted a more real action movie pushing aside the elaborate CGI effects and gave us a raw, high-octane and grounded action piece. Instead of a CGI budget, the money must have been spent of the editing and production units as the sequences and shoots are astonishing shot and equally spliced together. And then there\u2019s those moments of heart which are mostly reserved for Ferguson\u2019s story arc adding to that conflict of interest. There is a moment that had me echoing the same emotional connection I had with Raimi\u2019s Spider-Man 2, though I\u2019m probably on my own with that one. And these are both small and too far in between all the action that goes on barely giving the audience enough time to catch a breathe, let alone digest what\u2019s going on. Though this is a negative observation and is a likely result of the film being a caffeine-dosed version of the saga. And then there\u2019s Lorne Balde\u2019s impressive score. Balfe is now one of my favourite composers however the Zimmerish influence is impossible to deny. You only have to listen to tracks \u201cChange of Plan\u201d to pick up Zimmer\u2019s Batman Trilogy or \u201cFree Fall\u201d to hear the looming threat of Dunkirk. But it perfectly incorporates Lalo Schifrin\u2019s iconic theme throughout the score to hair-raising effect. Balfe does this with such craftsmanship and respect to the original theme, it becomes very much part of the score as oppose to just being a remixed or reworked version. Just listen to tracks \u201cThe Exchange\u201d and \u201cEscape Through Paris\u201d to hear what I\u2019m talking about. It has to said because it\u2019s something that normally niggles me when films get it wrong, but whilst the timing might be a little off, it\u2019s geographically accurate, in particular London. All the scenes were spot on and it\u2019s a refreshing change. It might not be so obviously to most viewers but to me, the London locations, even the unimportant scenes are all in sync meaning you could draw a logical and chronological map of action in the city. However, I can only speak of London, as Paris I\u2019m not too familiar with. It\u2019s the best of the series, possibly because it\u2019s actually more grounded yet upping the action content. It\u2019s going to be a hard movie to top. I definitely want to go watch this again.

This movie however, exceeds expectations in every way possible, and shows heart and soul throughout what could very well just another payday for Mr. Cruise and Paramount Pictures.\n\nWe have come to expect mediocre action from action movies in recent years, thanks to movies like Fast & Furious, but here the fights, the chases, the near-death situations are all very well shot and edited - not for one second will the viewer doubt that Tom Cruise is indeed capable of pulling off all these amazing stunts by himself. This, paired with a brilliant cast (Henry Cavill once again shines, this time as the villain, great performances by Vanessa Kirby and the quirky duo of Ving Rhames and Simon Pegg), delivers a phenomenal 2 and a half hours of cinema. \nStill, at times, it all feels a little rough around the edges, thanks to a sometimes confusing storyline (that will make a good bunch of casual viewers tune out after a while), even if at the end, it all kind of  makes sense. \nThe cinematography is tremendous, with some seriously gorgeous shots of Paris throughout the movie, the soundtrack is good but nothing special. \n\nOverall, \"Mission: Impossible - Fallout\" delivers what it promises: a thrilling action-movie, with a fantastic cast, great action sequences and a competent plot. It's a well-structured movie with relatable good-guys and detestable bad-guys, and sometimes... that's all its needed to make a good movie.",

            "content": "When it comes to action movies, Tom Cruise has no equal. Tom's commitment to creating action films that give the audience their money's has reached almost ridiculous levels with Fallout. To fall back on the old cliches, this is a true white-knuckle, breath-holding, heart-pounding action adventure that is excellently paced and perfectly executed. The only thing more pleasing than the incredible action is the fact that this is probably the best story of the franchise, leveraging not just Ethan's history, but that of the team that he's assembled and evolved through the previous 5 films, into a far more multi-faceted character, facing challenges which are personal, global, complex yet still straight-forward.. or at least as complex as you can really get in an action film. \nMost people know by now just how seriously Cruise takes his action; spending months honing new skills so he can do as many of his own stunts as possible, and doing as many stunts as possible in camera. He clearly expects, demands, and inspires the same level of excellence from everyone who works on his films, and Fallout may be the most extreme example of this nexus of passion, talent, expectation and execution.\nNow as far as stories go, Fallout doesn't really do anything you haven't seen in an MI film before. The film is full of exhilarating chase sequences with cars, motorcycles, boats, helicopters and of course, Tome Cruise Running.  The story follows the familiar territory of the world in peril and the only thing standing in the way of its destruction is Ethan Hunt and his team, who of course must at some point go it alone as again, his agency turns its back on him. You'd think that this basic plot structure would get old and stale, but in fact, each film seems to refine and improve on this basic structure in a way that not only remains fresh and entertaining, but when you're in the midst of it and you know that certain basic things are going to happen/have to happen,  you (for the most part) have typically have very little idea where they're going to come form specifically, Equally as impressive is that even though you can never see more than one step ahead, the story while complex, is never incomprehensible,.you are always given enough to understand what is happening, what's at stake at any given moment, and then it once all the strands are in place for the final showdown, they still the conclusion remains tense and with enough risk to keep you deeply engaged throughout. I was truly impressed at how after six films, they've managed to make each film better than the last (with the exception of MI2, sorry, that is the dog of this franchise) and MI6 seems almost impossible to top in my opinion.\nFallout is the definition of a big-budget action film.",

            "content": "They say lightning never strikes twice, much less three times. Yet for the third time in a row the Mission Impossible franchise has absolutely nailed it, delivering heart pounding, supremely satisfying summer entertainment.\n\nThose who have seen the trailers will have a basic idea of the story. Ethan Hunt and his team lost a trio of plutonium cores, and now he has to get them back by whatever methods necessary. Now despite what the trailers suggest, this movie is not about Ethan snapping and going rogue. The movie never even suggests it. But it is very much about whether he'll reach his limits and break his own most deeply held rules to complete the mission. Because with the stakes this high and with so many different players and agendas, there may not be any way to save the world and keep his hands clean.\n\nThis movie is also very much about Ethan's past. In many ways this installment is a continuation of the last film, featuring old friends and enemies and tying up loose plots threads you never noticed before. So much of what happens here is the direct result of the missions Ethan has completed and the choices he made before, all of them weighing heavily on the choices he has to make now. \n\nAfter six installments in the series the filmmakers have fully perfected the Mission Impossible formula. The pacing ranges from quick to breakneck. The chases and shoot-outs are excellent as always, and some of the fight scenes are worthy of Hong Kong. Henry Cavil is a powerhouse. The pure power of his fighting style is a perfect match for Hunt's kinetic improvisation. Fighting together they make a hell of a duo. When they come to blows with each other it's even better.\n\nAnd then there are the aerial sequences and other death-defying stunts that no Mission Impossible movie would be complete without. They may not top the data core scene from the last installment, but they are still absolutely breathtaking. I don't know how Cruise is able to keep doing these kinds of stunts at his age, but I can't argue with the results.\n\nAnd refreshingly, the plot is more than just an excuse to string together the action scenes. There are enough twists and stunning revelations to fill the best spy novel. Just when you think you know where it's going it manages to surprise and raise the stakes even higher. At times Fallout is a bit darker and grimmer than previous installments. Occasionally it even brings a touch of pathos. But the trademark wry humor is still there, if a little more subdued.\n\nUltimately this movie has everything that a summer blockbuster should. It's tense, exciting, action packed, and everything in it just works. On the heels of Ghost Protocol and Rogue Nation it's safe to say that the Mission Impossible franchise is delivering more consistently than than James Bond. I don't how long they can keep this up, but I look forward to finding out.",

Admittedly I was underwhelmed by M:I-2 (too many doves) and straight-up hated Rogue Nation (too many reasons to address), but I really enjoyed Ghost Protocol, and fucking loved M:I-3 (my former second favorite). M:I-6 is hands down the best action movie of the summer and probably one of the best action films ever. Twists, turns, humor, excitement, and old school special effects are utilized to ensure you don't lose interest for a second. This action extravaganza is two and a half hours (the longest M:I to date) and I didn't breathe for 99% of it. The film as a whole is unforgettable, but the stunts in particular, most of which were performed by Cruise himself, are impossibly good (pun intended, bitches!). This M:I is a solid A.",

Watch him convincingly fight men a fraction of his age some of whom, notably Henry Cavill, are a lot taller than he is. Cruise deserves credit for bringing humanity to a role that is really just glue for a bunch of X Games events with a spy theme. The set pieces are outstanding, the supporting cast is good, the \"plot\" recycles themes from other spy movies but we're never given time to think about it before the film manically rushes to the next set piece. That's o.k. We watch as bodies, cars and trucks fly through the air with the greatest of ease while our heroes sustain only bruises and cuts. Mission Impossible: Fallout is breathless entertainment. Tom Cruise and his cronies are all in. Spending a summer's afternoon watching the X Games hosted by The Human Fountain of Youth isn't a bad way to spend a few hours.

            "content": "Mission Impossible returns this year with another mission that may be impossible for anyone else, but not for Tom Cruise because that man can run like he's sponsored by Nike. After the success that was Mission Impossible: Rogue Nation (2015) having Christopher McQuarrie return for Fallout\u00a0was the right way to go and he shows that he has his finger on the pulse of this franchise. Just when you thought the action couldn't get any crazier McQuarrie uses his ability to gradually build suspense over time keep you locked in. This story takes place following a mission that goes wrong which leaves the IMF to race against the clock and put a stop to the threat. Once it kicks into gear it's fun, fast paced, and brings everything you expect from a Mission Impossible film to the table. You get the charismatic and ever so likeable ensemble, big action set-pieces, plot-turning twists, and Ethan Hunt running harder than he's ever run before.\n\n\n\nThe cast this time around is a great one packed with big names both new to the game and returning. Tom Cruise as far as I'm concerned IS Ethan Hunt, he can be in any number of action franchises but this the one character I feel like he nails every time. He really is a true movie star as his on-screen charisma sells you completely on all of these stunts which in reality wouldn't be nearly as successful. His tight-knit crew returns in the form of Simon Pegg and Ving Rhames who share a number of great on-screen moments with Cruise and have their fair share of light comedic moments here and there. Rebecca Ferguson also returns in an interesting role with an intriguing arc which keeps her around and very much in the thick of the action. On the villains side of things Sean Harris is back as Solomon Lane, he's such an absolute joy to watch as a villain and plays the role very well. The major newcomer is Henry Cavill who is sporting his Justice League-killing moustache whilst getting in on a number of action sequences. It can be hard at times to see him as someone other than Superman but he plays the role well here and keeps your mind off that.\u00a0\n\n\n\nAs for the progression of the story I will say it isn't quite as fast paced and right into the action in the beginning as I thought it'd be. But it doesn't take its time either, McQuarrie cleverly builds suspense with each successive sequence to where I found myself enjoying this movie more and more as it went on. In some aspects you could see where things were heading but for the majority of the story I had fun trying to figure out what tricks Hunt is going to pull off to get out of his many tough situations. It oddly felt like a wholly original experience within the shell of a story that I'm sure you've seen a number of times. There are these elements within the Mission Impossible franchise from the music, to the Ethan Hunt character, and the way it approaches spy-thriller action that make each one feel unique even though it's just a race against the clock story with some twists and turns here and there. As I mentioned it does take its time to ease you into the story and give people a bit of a refresher on what has happened in the franchise so far so you really don't need to have seen any of the previous entries to follow this story. I was a little lukewarm on the film in the first act but seeing how it all builds towards a strong finale it's worth the journey.\u00a0\n\n\n\nThe action takes centre-stage once again and seeing how it's going to one-up itself every time is part of the fun. Cruise was strapped to a plane in Rogue Nation but somehow he manages to up the stakes again this time around.\u00a0 Not only are the stunts and action sequences bigger but there are much more of them to fill the runtime. With each consecutive one it upped the stakes significantly and kept the story moving at a quick pace, not letting it meander around on some slower moments. The fight sequences, chase scenes, car scenes, helicopter scenes, they're all immensely fun to watch and capture what it is to be a Mission Impossible movie. When the iconic theme kicks in at some key moments it never fails to get you pumped and ready for the action. McQuarrie has created another gem in this spy-thriller franchise and I honestly just want him to keep going, maybe hire a stunt-double for Cruise next time so he doesn't kill himself though.\u00a0\n\n\n\nSo, with that we say goodbye to another Mission Impossible film and a great one at that. It's one of those rare franchises that seems to have found its tone, its niche, and just finds ways to keep pumping out great thrill rides. The non-stop action will keep you invested and going along with a crew of great characters and actors makes the whole thing that much more enjoyable. There's rarely a dull moment as it builds in intensity as it progresses towards a finale that caps it all off to a tee. Fans of the franchise know what they're getting into and newcomers can also enjoy this entry without any prior knowledge of the 5 films that came before it.\u00a0\n\n8.1/10",

            "content": "The Last Movie Star.\n\nIf one were to write a biography of Tom Cruise, that would have to be the title. Over the past several decades, Hollywood has come to rely less and less on the draw of large personalities. Most blockbusters are now marketed with spectacle and imagery, not names above the title. Yet Cruise remains. Like a dogged survivor in one of his films, he's living history stalking the tall grass of change, continually proving his own industry wrong.\n\nAnd, if Mission: Impossible - Fallout is any indication, he has no intention of slowing down. Not only is the movie the most action-packed of the series, it may also be the best. Mind, this doesn't mean it's a masterpiece; the bar hasn't been set especially high when it comes to depth and intelligence. But if you enjoy the franchise, particularly the last two entries, it would be a true chore to dislike this one.\n\nThe plot-always secondary in these films, always a bit too complicated for its own good-begins in Belfast. There, IMF* agent Ethan Hunt (Cruise) learns of a splinter group of assassins who call themselves the 'Apostles' and have essentially become terrorists-for-hire. They're trying to get their hands on a trio of recently-stolen plutonium cores (you can guess the reason). Also involved are an anarchist named John Lark and the previous film's villain, Solomon Lane (Sean Harris).\n\nAfter a botched exchange in Berlin, in which the plutonium is lost, Hunt and his team (Simon Pegg, Ving Rhames) are tasked by IMF Secretary Alan Hunley (Alec Baldwin) with recovering the cores through a meeting in Paris between Lark and a black-market broker known as the White Widow (Vanessa Kirby). Still with me? Suffice to say aborted directives, double-crosses and general chaos follow the key players from Europe all the way to the edge of the Himalayas, where Hunt's past finally catches up with him.\n\nOne thing I greatly admire in movies is ambition. As evidenced by the story, Fallout holds nothing back. Whether or not it covers the most geographic ground in the franchise, it plays like the biggest entry. Whereas past missions were stop-gaps, this is a culmination. Stakes rise, secrets are revealed; lives change.\n\nAt least, on screen. Oh that such emotions extended to the audience. But, for the most part, that effect has been absent from M:I's M.O. for quite some time. Not since the third movie did the narrative forsake its glossy, stunt-riddled surface to mine genuine feeling. And M:I-3 made the least amount of money in the franchise, so it's understandable that such a personal direction would be rerouted. \n\nBut without it, Mission: Impossible-and Fallout specifically-is destined to be the prettiest belle at a second-rate ball. For all its globe-trotting, it's only a partial experience. We see all-and are amazed-but feel little, and remember less. Each character is more caricature than human being, trading the details of life for the whims of a streamlined script. Like Marvel or The Fast and the Furious, Fallout doesn't present reality; it paraphrases it.\n\nSome may call this nitpicking, and they wouldn't be far off. But the bar must be raised when it comes to depth, because it's already been surpassed in nearly every other aspect. Visually, Fallout is a ball of frenetic joy, a feast for the eyes. The scenery is always changing; we can imagine the cameras struggling to keep up with such a rapidly unfolding plot. \n\nThat plot, though, can be its own worst enemy. There are only so many twists a story can stand before each one starts to mean a little less.\n\nThankfully, other factors maintain our attention. Lorne Balfe's score adds some taught variation to Lalo Schifrin's classic theme. And while each member of the cast does fine, Henry Caville stands out as a mysterious CIA officer. The role fits him better than Superman's tights.\n\nBut in the end, it all comes back to Cruise. He's the reason we watch, and his relentless energy fuels the entire franchise. Fallout runs Hunt through the requisite gauntlet of stunts: hanging from a helicopter above mountainous terrain; speeding through the packed streets of Paris on a motorcycle; skydiving from thirty-thousand feet. \n\nBut more than death-defying acrobatics is the quality they signify: devotion. When an actor who has nothing left to prove consistently gives everything he's got, admiration is easy.\n\n* In case you were curious, 'IMF' stands for Impossible Missions Force.",

            "content": "The Mission franchise is an interesting one.  It's spanned over 20 years, has only had two actors appear in every film, has never fully embraced continuity, and has undoubtedly gone through many production issues.  Alas, it's also one of the greatest franchises because it has defied what it means to impress audience with action and it keeps getting better and better with every film.  Although admittedly, I'm not exactly sure how it can get any better from here.  I saw this movie early, and instantly felt it was one of the best action movies of all time, but I also knew I needed to see it at least one more time before I really did give it that title.  Well, I've seen the film 4 times now and each time further cemented my feelings. Everything from the Halo jump, to the middle act (which is essentially one long chase sequence), to the callbacks, to the Helicopter scene, to Henry Cavill's unnecessary but totally bada** facial hair.  Mission: Impossible Fallout is an unbelievable ride that simply never lets up.  Even in its quiet moments, it has touching dialogue that makes the action more weighted.  Even in my 4 viewings, I've never been bored, and I can't wait to see it again.  It also surprisingly had a great amount of emotional stakes, something the serious didn't really have since Mission 3.  There are a few moments with Ving Rhames, Rebecca Ferguson, and Michelle Monaghan that really hit me emotionally, and I never would have expected that from this series.  It has the best antagonist(s) since Phillip Seymour Hoffman, and maybe even better, the action is easily the most impressive in years (probably since Fury Road), and the actors have never been better.   If there's going to be another one, then take your time and do it right, because this could very well be the best conclusion possible for the series.  Thank you to Tom Cruise and Christopher McQuarrie for making this an instant classic. \n\n10/10",

Rebecca Ferguson is now my forever ultimate femme hero and her chemistry with Cruise was hot hot hot. Henry Cavill proved to be a worthy adversary to Cruise and Vanessa Kirby made her stand as an up and coming actress as well. I'm hoping Angela Basset, who is such a bad a**,  be given the role as the new IMF boss. Simon Pegg had me worried there for a minute, but thankfully it all worked out.

Which is kinda crazy cause I have always been a huge fan of the spy drama since I was a little kid.So much that it is very strange when I find a spy franchise like this that has been around for so long, but hey....its fun not going to lie there. \n\nThe biggest positive I can see on this movie was the action is freaking amazing. Every scene feels truly brutal and powerful. I love movies with this very brutal action scenes that feel very much like John Wick or Winter Solder. Every punch given feels harder and it makes the stakes feel higher than they are. And Tom Cruise only adds to that with his action also not being perfect. He isn't the perfect fighter in the film. There are scenes where he falls and gets hurt and you feel that. Moments of just real intensity that just blow you away.\n\nHenry Cavil also plays a great yang to Tom Cruise as his really ramps up every scene he is in and heck even steals the show at certain points and I absolutely love that.He pulls off every scene he is in with great flare and a mustache to boot to go along with it. Was the mustache needed? I don;t really think so, but it was a great add on anyway. \n\nThe movie's greatest weakness is its execution of its twist. The twist really feel forced and unneeded at times for me. More to give a big gasp over anything else. Im not going to give away the twist here, but there is a scene or rather a collection of scenes back to back when we get one twist after the other and it feels really dragging. \n\nOverall though Mission Impossible is a fun time at the theater and one I'd highly recommend.",

            "content": "I CHOOSE TO ACCEPT IT - My Review of MISSION IMPOSSIBLE: FALLOUT (4 Stars)\n\nWow!  (Wait 5 seconds)  Wow!  (Wait another 5 seconds) Wow!  Yep, that about sums up the experience of watching MISSION IMPOSSIBLE: FALLOUT, the incredibly entertaining, endlessly thrilling new entry in the beloved movie franchise which started with the bar pretty high when Brian De Palma directed the first and has continued along with quite good results.  Christopher McQuarrie, who directed the last installment, continues here and while not exactly making a film for the ages, he has produced a whopping feat in action cinema.  This is one start-to-finish set piece extravaganza and a shining example of studio blockbuster entertainment made right.\nTom Cruise returns as IMF Agent Ethan Hunt and this time, he and his cohorts need to thwart the sale of plutonium before it gets in the wrong hands and destroys the planet.  Yep, it's that simple and the streamlined plot, expertly laid out, makes it easier to ride along from one crazy sequence after another.  It's a terrific setup. I love that McQuarrie has chosen not to update the old school reel-to-reel tape spelling out Hunt's mission.  There's a fizzy feeling when the tape self-destructs, leaving a trail of smoke as it always has and as it always should be!\nAs Ethan and his teammates (Simon Pegg and Ving Rhames) avoid mortal danger in the opening scenes, a wonderfully pulpy, clever twists sends us off to a blazing title sequence, all of which caused the audience I was in to applaud a couple of times...but this movie is just getting started.\nEnter CIA honcho played by Angela Bassett, who doesn't trust Ethan et al to get the goods, so she assigns her own strongman, August Walker, to shadow them. He's played by Henry Cavill, and if he weren't a star already, this film would turn him into one.  He may not deliver his expository lines with a master's touch.  In fact, he's pretty wooden at times, but overall, this is a fantastic, iconic performance.  Whether he's skydiving with Cruise, or taking part in one of the most thrilling bathroom fight sequences I've seen (on a par with EASTERN PROMISES), or...well there are so many, just go and see for yourself.  Cavill is all moustache, tight suits, and hulking action moves as he towers over Cruise and makes a true mark in the film.  Cavill brings out a great competitive spirit in Cruise, giving their scenes a spark...some may categorize that spark as the most homoerotic/ men fighting type since Ken Russell's WOMEN IN LOVE...or they just punch and growl at each other a lot.  You figure it out.  \nAlso on hand to make things pop is Rebecca Ferguson as Hunt's Ally/Enemy, Ilsa Faust.  She's so good, and it's such a relief to see her shine again after the dismal SNOWMAN from earlier this year.  MVP honors, however, go to Vanessa Kirby as White Widow, a spooky negotiator who floats in and out of the film with an alien air of mystery.  She's weird in a Tilda Swinton meets Lady Gaga way, and the film benefits from all that is her.  \nBut, of course, these films live or die because of Tom Cruise.  As he gets older, he has eschewed so much of his All American Boy spirit, replacing it with a tired, world-weariness which works wonders when you're faced with certain nuclear destruction.  Knowing that he likes to do as many of his own stunts as possible seems to work wonders when enjoying these scenes. In this film, he skydives, rides a motorcycle through Paris, runs thrillingly across rooftops, flies a helicopter and dangles from a lot of ropes, whether they're hanging from said copter or from the side of a steep cliff, and we as an audience applaud his...I don't know...insane willingness to die for us?  I guess that's what it is.  Tom Cruise wants to die for our sins!  Whatever the case, this is a performance to be treasured for its laser-focused commitment to action.\nSure, it's not perfect.  There's one scene I'm calling EXPOSITION FOR DUMMIES, because the characters tell us what's happening, and just in case we missed it, they say it all over again.  It's an odd moment reeking of studio notes to make sure everything is crystal clear.  Also, Michele Monaghan once again gets straddled with a nothing role, and folks, she's a great, great actor.  Can somebody please use her well asap?  \nBut, pretty much everything else about this film works phenomenally.  McQuarrie knows just where to put the camera, turning even a simple early moment of a car pulling up into a swooping, swirling thrill.  McQuarrie also truly understands suspense and the joy of well-earned reveals and clever callbacks.  It's still a thrill when people tear away rubber masks in these movies.  I walked away from MISSION IMPOSSIBLE: FALLOUT (really clever title btw) simultaneously exhausted and satisfied, which is clearly McQuarrie, Cruise and company's mission.",

            "content": "The hype is real.  So resuming where the last movie left off, Ethan Hunt (Tom Cruise) and his team are still picking up the pieces of a mission gone wrong.  Seems like the criminal organization known as The Syndicate has now become The Apostles, and they are bent on obtaining plutonium so as to construct bombs for nefarious purposes.  Will IMF be able to save the day?  Now I wasn't actually sold by the trailers of this.  It's not that they looked bad, it just didn't look like anything that wasn't already covered in Rogue Nation, which was simply a decent film.  I was going to skip it or at the very least wait until home release... that is, until the rave reviews started to pour in.  A 97% fresh rating on rottentomatoes is enough for me to take any film seriously, and let me go ahead and cut the tension: this does not disappoint.  Now if this ended up being as good as Ghost Protocol, I was going to walk out of the theater a happy camper.  While I personally prefer the fourth film, Fallout is not a movie to be trifled with.  This is a story that doesn't really ever let up as far as the action goes.  As soon as the opening credits stop, it keeps moving from rewarding set piece to rewarding set piece.  Every action sequence in this has payoff, and I will go out on a limb and say that you are not going to see better choreographed action all summer.  It is refreshing because there is a lack of CGI in this.  When given the choice, director Christopher McQuarrie chooses actually doing the stunt instead of covering it up in post production at least 95% of the time if not more.  This especially puts you in the moment when there is gigantic spectacle happening all around, and to be frank, that's exactly what I watch blockbusters for.  I caught myself holding my breath at a number of different points in this, and the action is shot about as well as it can be filmed.  The locations are exotic and terrific, and Tom Cruise shows no sign of slowing down despite being over five and a half decades old.  Everything is tied together by an amazing score, and while it wasn't composed by Hans Zimmer, it gave me Dark Knight vibes like whoa.  I prefer Ghost Protocol because it is more of a fun wow, and this is more of a serious wow.  It really boils down to what your personal preference is, but this is something you should still see on as big of a screen as possible.",

(Giggles)\n\nBenji: Yeah but not in a situation like this.\n\nEthan: Benji..,Relax, I won't let them harm you. (Smiles)\n\nYeah the dialogues by Ethan Hunt (Tom Cruise) says it all. The reason why he's always rouge is to protect his friends and loved ones and not to mention the entire life force. The same charisma applies to the latest franchise, unlike any other Mission Impossible movies in Fallout Ethen Hunt shows his compassion to other beings, how he respects an innocent sole, just like the Dragon Ball character Goku,Hunt show's his naive part by sparing the life's of... yeah even his enemies' like Solomon Lane.\n\nNaive part of Goku and Ethan Hunt\nOk, Now to the main part about the movie, well the movie begins from where Rouge nation ends, after the Syndicate got neutralized a lot of people linked to it where caught or killed, where as there were still some(The Apostles,a terrorist group) who's real identities were unknown and they plans to have some massive destruction and terror by using an element called Plutonium, Ethan's Mission is to get that Plutonium in safe hands of the C.I.A, well that's about it, I ain't gonna reveal the whole story to give some spoilers so that I could destroy the whole mood of yours, Jeez I am not that evil. So let's get to the part where I say about the technical, directional and other stuffs about the movie, shall we???\n\nThe Positives's\n\nThe Stunt's: What about the stunt's? What about it, for God's sake we're talking about Tom Cruise here. That's right the stunt's are undoubtedly the best not just in the whole career of Tom Cruise but may be one of the greatest stunt's ever in the history of cinema, the stunt's alone will make you happy for the money you've spent on that ticket you've brought.\n\nTom Cruise helicopter stunt in Fallout\nThe Plot: The plot of the movie is well written and well directed thanks to the Director/Script Writer Christopher McQuarrie who did his once Academy Award winning magic(McQuarrie won the Academy Award for Best Original Screenplay for The Usual Suspects).\n\nTechnologically the movie's on top level, you will find the camera angles and the VFX mind blowing. Before you go just checkout some shots at Nolan movies like The Dark Knight, you're gonna love Mission Impossible-Fallout's Visual's, well of course Christopher Nolan's on anoter level but so do Christopher McQuarrie.\n\nThe Cast: Well the cast, ha no word, Tom Cruise,Henry Cavill,Ving Rhames,Simon Pegg,Rebecca Ferguson, Michelle Monaghan,Angela Bassett,Alec Baldwin,etc.. are perfectly aligned, It was a good call casting The Superman against Ethan Hunt so that the Superman realizes it's not just batman who can stop him if he goes berserk(lol), and oops can't help it another tiny spoiler, It was a good call casting Both Michelle Monaghan and Wes Bentley(You'll know what I mean when you see the movie) got some good sense of humor flowing through the veins between some hardcore actions without effecting the plot.\n\nMission Impossible Fallout Cast Poster\nThe list goes on and on\n\nThe Negative's\n\nSean Harris's go less screen presence.\n\nSean Harris's less screen presence is a negative in Mission Impossible Fallout\nWhy is Jeremy Renner's William Brandt not in the movie??? Well we know it's because of his Hawkeye character he's been playing for the Infinity War Sequel, but hey Jeremy you're been missed in the movie.\n\nHawkeye over William Brandt\nCan't think of any other negatives.\n\nThe movie won't make you regret for your money and time, go for it without fear, Go get it Tiger.......\n\nJohn Wick and Eathan Hunt Actions\nFinal Verdict: One of The best Action movies of recent times especially when you consider the plot, Mission: Impossible - Fallout falls under the best category of Action with Good plot just like John Wick: Chapter 2 or may be even better since it got some humor too. I will give it a 4.5/5\n\nVisit http://oakshow.in/Profiles/CriticProfiles/JithinJPrasad/mission-impossible-fallout-review-by-jithin-j-prasad.html to read my review properly.",

However, the real Mission: Impossible is how Cruise and returning writer-director Christopher McQuarrie manages to avoid staleness and repetition in an ageing franchise and not only manage to mount a series of spectacular and expectations-defying action sequences but also makes the normally contrived, if not implausible, action narrative that link it all together feels relevant and believable. Smaller scenes in between the explosive and daring sequences and expositions actually delivers humour, sophistication and class, even, unexpectedly. With a half decent script and excellent pacing, I was totally gripped and exhausted by the end of the tension-filled 2hrs+ experience which left me gasping on the edge of my seat, and quite happy to forgive minor sins such as Henry Cavill's obviously written character (with that infamous moustache) and the almost superpowers some characters possess to be exactly at the right place at the right time either by coincidence or design. Meticulously and brilliantly executed, this is already front-runner for Action Movie of 2018, and contender for best of the series and could, in time, surpass my fondness for M:I3 one day.",

The effort Mr Cruise and Co put into MISSION: IMPOSSIBLE FALLOUT will payout tenfold. It is already on track to be the highest rating and highest grossing MISSION: IMPOSSIBLE movie and the good news from this is that they will be making more. Action movies of recent years have become fatiguing, we have seen it all, been impressed as much as we could, but MISSION: IMPOSSIBLE FALLOUT laughs in the face of common place and done-before, it just throws its star out of anything moving and hopes he survives.

Fallout continues the successful run of the rebooted series and delights in escalating stakes and stunts that get more implausible but more exhilarating as it progresses. The film climaxes in a stunning set piece that will have mouths agape and people cheering. What is also special about this kind of film is the lack of a cliffhanger, ending  in a definite curtain close that suggests this is exactly how this series needed to end. It may not be a masterpiece, but its gorgeous cinematography, clever action sequences and terrific performances, mostly from the female cast, ensure this series will end on a high note. Rating: 83",

This may, to a very large extent, seem like a carbon copy of any James Bond movie except for one major factor. Tom Cruise. With age catching up on the Hollywood heartthrob, it is his sheer perseverance, grit, determination and hard work that makes the movie a successful venture. An actor well past his prime, volunteers to perform his stunts himself even after repeated injuries all this when you are 56 years old, deserves not just a pat on the back but all the adulation that he can.\n              Commercial movies are an expensive product. Add in Tom Cruise, the expenses just doubled. However, when there is a sure shot formula for a successful movie, the budget to make one would just be a secondary concern as you have the best technicians at your service. In such an environment, the technical aspects of the movie will far excel the expected output and redraw boundaries and set new standards for all future movies. Mission Impossible : Fallout is the standard template on how to make a successful commercial movie while elevating itself as a wholesome movie.\nFor the complete and detailed review, check out the link : https://akhileshchetty.wordpress.com/2018/07/31/mission-impossible-fallout-movie-review/",

It seems like the last three or four have been really good and the first one or two were only so-so.  Now we have Mission Impossible Fallout.  First the  good stuff, as visually the stunts and action here rival any movie.  The reason being is CGI is used only when necessary, and it doesn't replace real live stunts.  Everyone falls back into their roles quite nicely, and the story is interesting enough to hold our attention.  The downside to me is that there are too many \"no way\" sequences.  Tom Cruise can't run in an all out sprint for over five minutes.  I mean come on?  The helicopter chase while visually really cool is also a little too far fetched for me.  Also, a fifteen minute countdown in the movie actually took 25 minutes (I looked at my watch out of curiosity).  All that being said, the twists and turns are pretty cool.  You see some from a mile away, and others are a good surprise.  It's a solid sequel, but I'd like to see some more weight and depth to it if they continue.",

Entire cast including Tom Cruise gave a very blend & forceful performance in terms of acting which i wasn't too disappointed over. Well, expecting an all out A-class performance in every mainstream crash & bang action flick is being too disective. However the close-up vivid shots & wide angle shots for all the action portions were sharp & without a doubt showed off the excellence of VFX. But the cinematography, I'll say it was just above average. All in all, the films quick & intelligible screenplay didn't bore one bit but in overall Fallout wasn't memorable.\n\nRating:  6.8/10",

None of that awful shakey cam fighting here, just concise editing that clearly communicates the action and geography of each sequence. the fight choreography team bring a bruising physicality to the combat, and it's a big improvement over the invunerable ethan hunt from the earlier outings. this is tom cruises best film for ages. Well worth your time.",

            "content": "It has taken on average 3.5 years for Tom Cruise to release Mission Impossible movies since the first came out back in 1999.  For my money over the last 20 years, this is the best action franchise in Hollywood still making movies.  I stated it after I saw Ghost Protocol and again after Rogue Nation; Tom Cruise - love him or hate him - is Hollywood's best action hero.  Much like those other two film I just mentioned, Fallout earns its 5-star rating and cements the franchise as one of the best.\n\nCruise is an anomaly.  Both revered for his acting chops but seared for his off-camera beliefs and actions in his private life, I think he has mostly leveled out as a pretty genuine guy since he left the day-to-day spotlight a handful of years ago.  He is the best action star Hollywood has for this generation.  He's a self-proclaimed perfectionist.  Every stunt (all done himself), every thread, and every interaction in the movie is tailored to his vision.  The movie is a mirror to Cruise as an actor: exhilarating, cool, humorous, and a bit dangerous.  His stunts are breathtaking.  From the HALO jump in the opening third to the car chases, foot chases, and motorcycle chases in the middle to the unbelievable helicopter fight scene in the final third, Cruise leaves it all out on the table.  There's a point where he says to his team on the ground he won't let them down.  I have full confidence he meant for that to be a nod to the audience as well.\n\nAlso back for the first time is repeat director and famed Oscar-winning Hollywood screenwriter Christopher McQuarrie.  He filmed Rogue Nation, so it was only right he return to wrap up a story over the two films we saw begin in the former.  \n\nWhile I won't harp on the plot too much, we get a brief recap of what the team has been up to in the two years from the end of Rogue Nation to the start of Fallout. After that, it's off and running with twists, turns, dips, and dives of a classic spy thriller to keep track of where everyone stands.\n\nRebecca Ferguson, Ving Rames, Simon Pegg, and Alec Baldwin are all back.  The only conspicuous actor missing was Jeremy Renner due to a scheduling conflict, but I found it a tad off putting he wasn't even mentioned because he did survive Rogue Nation.  Also back is the villain, Sean Harris, as the vile Solomon Lane.  We get introduced to three new players as well: Angela Bassett as a CIA big wig, Henry Cavil as her CIA operative, and Vanessa Kirby as a new broker for bad guys (pay close attention to her story for those easter eggs).  All of them are tremendous in their roles.  \n\nOverall, if you are looking for the summer blockbuster that was promises but hadn't delivered because of a slow and tired Hollywood output, look no further.  MI6 continues to bring the pain and will almost certainly lend itself to a seventh film down the line.  It's just a shame we have to wait another 3.5 years to get the next.",

Who would've thought they'd save their best stuff for the sixth film? Here is my review of 'Mission: Impossible - Fallout.'\n\nIn the sixth film in the series we are reunited with Tom Cruise and his infamous 'Ethan Hunt' character as well as the rest of the gang, Simon Pegg and Ving Rhames. This film is directed and written by Christopher McQuarrie. This is the second 'Mission Impossible' he has directed, the first being 'Mission: Impossible - Rogue Nation' (2015). Following all the hype mustered up by this film I found myself surprisingly excited to see it. I got to see the opening day viewing and I was not disappointed. Christopher McQuarrie is the perfect director for these films as proven by two back-to-back successful films as well as this being, in my opinion, the best film in the franchise to date. 'Fallout' is a sheer epic. It has everything you want in an action film and it does it all perfectly. While giving the audience some intense and top-notch barrages of action, writer/director Christopher McQuarrie balanced in a very strong and clear pointed plot. This perfect balance made for a perfect action film. \n\nTom Cruise yet again delivers a strong performance and his stunts continue to be jaw-dropping. McQuarrie's direction with these action sequences are perfect and some stunning and edge-of-the-seat scenes do happen rather frequently in this film. Henry Cavill is also in this movie and it was great to finally see the now infamous-stache on the big screen. I had my slight doubts in him at times during the movie but continuously with each and every passing scene Cavill seemed to just get better and better. He brought a lot to the film and definitely served a strong purpose. Simon Pegg is entertaining as always, as is Ving Rhames. Sean Harris is also in the film and he brings a good strong presence as the films mysterious villainous character. Harris owns the role and brings genuine darkness to the film. \n\nWhat puts this film head and shoulders above other action flicks is the insane and pristine camera work. Some of the shots that were taken during this film are absolutely stunning and I found myself turning to the person beside me admiring these shots on several occasions. This all made for rather grand and certainly epic scenes. The moment I left the theatre I was ready to turn back around and head back in for more. \n\nWhile the story isn't necessarily fresh, Christopher McQuarrie does a good job at telling this story and unfolding a very picture-perfect spy film. There are some characters I definitely would have liked to have seen developed more. As previously stated, the brilliance in balance within the film is truly unmatched and story is not compromised at the hands of over usage of CGI or cheap jokes. This is the quintessential action movie of 2018 and the summer blockbuster we needed oh so badly.",

This film has surpassed its predecessors just as each installment has seemed to do.

Conflicting situations that seem to have no possible solution fill the runtime, along with brilliant camera work that\u2019ll slow down the epic sequences into moments that\u2019ll be remembered forever. McQuarrie proves he has the masterful talent to carry out this franchise into the masterpiece each new installment has become. His filmmaking will leave you feeling for each character, whether good or bad, and feeling every punch they take, as well. Proven with just one viewing, this film is a masterpiece. It\u2019s one for the shelf and one that\u2019ll entertain for decades and decades to come. Calling it close, as the IMF team famously does, is exactly what this film doesn\u2019t do. It calls it as soon as it starts its first scene because this one has taken the top of its series and of the summer.

            "content": "Now THIS is how you do a Summer Blockbuster Film! The mustache problems from Justice League was worth it in order for Henry Cavill's role to be more effective. This movie had everything you could ask for. All the crazy stunts were all done by Tom Cruise's stunt double, Tom Cruise! But seriously, it makes the action sequences that much more exciting knowing that Tom did all of his stunts. The supporting cast also did a wonderful job. The comedic relief couldn't be pulled off any more perfectly, without being out of place, by Simon Pegg as Benji. Ving Rhames, is the down to earth, tech specialist, Luther, who brings a calming presence to such frantic scenes. Rebecca Ferguson is essentially the badass MI6 agent, Ilsa, who brings a balance with her action scenes and love interest to Ethan Hunt. The story starts out with Ethan Hunt essentially trying to track 3 plutonium cores that he let get into the wrong hands, because he focused on saving one of his team members instead of sacrificing them to save the millions. Alex Baldwin is awesome as the head of the CIA. We are also graced by the ageless, Angela Bassett, who not only has short scenes, but brings a presence of authority that no other person could pull off. The only thing that may not be as powerful as the previous Mission Impossible entries is the musical score. Nothing really stood out to, specially since I've heard the likes of Hans Zimmer put their touch on the series. It was all mainly orchestral scores and it enhanced a lot of the scenes because there's so much going on. The cinematography is well done. The beautifully placed shots of the Kashmir regions and the way the scenes are composed fit perfectly to the movie. It didn't try to take something from a Paul Greengrass Bourne movie with its shaky cam styles, or a more muted color scheme like the latest Bond films. I recommend everybody to watch this film, specially while it's in the theater, to fully get that summer blockbuster feeling. The action scenes are so much better and you will have a great time, ooh-ing, aah-ing and gasping, much like my fellow moviegoers in the theater with me.",

MI6 has a great story. The story is actually incredible. It knows what was done in the past, it knows that people are going to figure our twists by now, so what was done? They twist the twist. It's just incredible.\n\nMusic in this film is also the best one yet in this franchise. When I saw Lorne Balfe's name at the start of the film, I was like 'It's such an obvious choice to have him on board'. He's made some incredible work in Ubisoft's Assassin's Creed series and having him here, bring that orchestral glory that the film needed so much. The usual theme track was completely transformed, it gave 'Fallout' the true sound and weight.\n\nOverall, I must say I don't think this franchise can get any better. I think It should be the last film, such a grand ending! If there's going to be more films coming, well I'm waiting, but It probably won't be superior to this, it's actually - mission impossible.",

            "content": "\"Your mission, should you *choose* to accept it.\" I wonder, did you ever choose not to? The end you've always feared is coming.\"\n\nWOAH!\n\nYou know, I normally stay cool and collective when movies with this amount of hype blows up, but f**k it. This freaking lived up to the hype. I mean, wow. Probably one of the best action movies of the year. From start till finish, you're captivated by the practicality of these action sequences. Never feeling repetitive or boring. Foot chase, car chase, or helicopter chase - It's going to be awhile for any action movie to top what they did.\n\nThis franchise has age like fine wine.\n\nFirst Things First, the action scenes - where do I begin? Or which scene to talk about. Oh yeah, THE BATHROOM SCENE! Holy sh*t, talk about a white-knuckled hand to hand fight. No dialogue, no music, and no shaky cam whatsoever. Rough and brutal with nothing pretty about it. Also Henry Cavill reloading his arms was the cherry on top. We will come back to Cavill later.\n\nThe halo sky dive scene was amazing and nuts, but what's even more nuts when you find out Tom Cruise did the stunt over 100 times. Along with poor Craig O'Brien, who captured the stunt from the massive IMAX camera. This explains why it was so intense to watch. Of course the helicopter sequence, which could have been 2 hours and 27 minutes long and I wouldn't be bored.\n\nThe sound design is really fantastic and really detailed with everything that's going on. You can hear the whoosh when someone throws a punch. Gunshots hitting brick walls or whizz by, brought up the intensity.\n\nChristopher McQuarrie returns as director for the sixth installment and I think he outdid himself. This guy knows how to set up 'the domino' effect with certain scenes to surprise and make your jaw drop. Masterpiece in film making and shot composition - beautifully done by cinematographer Rob Hardy. While it's unknown (right now) who will take over directing for the seven movie, but oh boy they got some shoes to fill. I don't think McQuarrie can top himself. Then again, I said something similar about 'Rogue Nation'. I will never learn.\n\nAnd hey, the villains were pretty menacing this time around. A rare thing sometimes in these movies.\n\nTom Cruise is nearly 60 years old and yet, continues to prove age is just a number. You can hate or criticize Cruise all you want, but you gotta respect someone who puts this much dedication in life threatening situations for the right take. An action star who puts in the hard work. He's basically killing himself for two hours.\n\nHenry Cavill makes a welcome addition to the franchise as a mustache twirling agent. Cavill is best known for playing superman and made a big name for himself, however the movies themselves failed to meet his success. In this movie, he plays a big bully who isn't afraid to kill on instinct. There's something deeply unpleasant about him. Every time he walks in frame with this stone cold look adds to the uneasiness. Especially during the fight scenes where Cavill shows off his physicality and fast brutal punches. This is the best I've seen from him. Justice League? Never heard of it.\n\nThe team dynamic was excellent and gives plenty of room for character development among the anarchy. Ving Rhames, Simon Pegg, and Rebecca Ferguson are all terrific.\n\nHow is the actual story of the film? Well, nothing original just like the previous ones. Elevating on presentation and ties in with events on the other movies - Involving plenty of twist and turns. Some people may have an issue with that which I can understand. The film demands your attention throughout, as references are dropped left and right. The movie builds a lot off the previous film which you have to see or remember about, because if not, then you're lost.\n\nIf I have to pick any issue, it will have to be some of the score. Now don't get me wrong, I thought the score was good and blends perfectly along with the action scenes, but it did sound familiar. Yeah, 'The Dark Knight Rises' score. People have already brought this up, so I become more aware when listening. Bit distracting as I had the Every Frame a Printing video on 'Hollywood Scores & Soundtracks', in my mind. That's it really.\n\nOverall rating: Please do yourself a favor and see this on the biggest screen you can. The action, sound work, characters, and acting were all superb. Believe the hype!",

But, at some point, you just have to shake your head and stop reveling in just how much Tom Cruise's 58 year-old can really take and just how much luck or conincidence Ethan Hunt can count on. At a certain point, you just have to say \"come, on.\"\n\nAdd a plot that's always twisting and turning, outside of the obvious callbacks to previous M:I movies (you're who now?), the twist that almost every M:I movie has already made (really, who didn't see that coming?), music that goes from amazing to annoying - often in the same scene and runtime that just seemed to go on too long.\n\nIt can be - and is a fun movie, there are many gasp inducing moments. But, it almost seems to be \"look at what we can do\" action rather than move the plot along action. The awes are awesome and it makes for a thrilling ride... but outside of that, it's goes on too long and relies too much plot twists to be any sort of convincing spy caper.",

Mission Impossible: Fallout is a roller coaster ride. Once again, the MI franchise is feeling the JJ Abrams touch as part the Bad Robot production family. There are plots within plots, double crosses and triple crosses. The core of this mission has Tom Cruise and the IMF team shadowed by CIA operative Walker played by Henry Cavill (Superman). A lot of the humor comes from this virtual male appendage measuring contest. Cavill is great at this.  Along with regulars Ving Rhames, Alec Baldwin, and Simon Pegg, Fallout is an MI:Rogue Nation reunion of sorts with the return of Sean Harris as villain Simon Lane and Rebecca Ferguson as MI6 agent Ilsa Faust. This one has a great feel of the 1960-1970s TV series. MI:F is also a movie post card of one of the most beautiful cities in the world, Paris France. The valley in the Kashmir doesn't look too shaby either. Director/co-writer Christopher McQuarrie has made a tight fast paced movie. The action set pieces are some of the best in the espionage action genre EVER.  Your mission if you choose to accept it is to go see this movie.",

Then have Simon Pegg put on a Scooby Doo mask and completely con the bad guys!  Make sure the bad guys, you know, the elite syndicate of global assassins, stoop to every movie cliche in the moment of truth and sabotage their own plans.  There should definitely be a scene where one of the good guys has a noose thrown around his neck and is hung up, only to have his partner kick a box to him so he can stand on tiptoes while the fight continues on.  And by all means, set a 15 minute timer on the bomb and let us watch our beloved bomb defusing squad clip wires for 20 minutes.  Way too many played out aspects to this movie to stay invested.

Heck it might actually be one of the best action movies ever.\n\nStory: It's very simple but honestly that is fine. Mission goes bad and could now lead to an even worse event involving nuclear bombs. It's very generic but the journey itself is full of twist and turns that manages to surprise you and keep you hooked\n\nCharacters: Everyone from rogue nation is back (except Jeremy Renner) and it also includes Angela Bassett as the new CIA leader and Henry Cavill as Walker a CIA assassin/agent. All of the returning cast do a great job but props to Ving Rhames as Luther for giving a much different side to him in this film. Henry Cavill is amazing as an counterpart to Tom Cruise Ethan Hunt which makes me feel like the moustache was worth it. Angela Bassett on the other hand was very underutilised in this film which is a shame since she did good with the limited appearance she had. In the film we get to see much more inside the mind of Ethan Hunt and we finally know a lot more about his personality which makes this film feel much more like a personal story which the other Mission Impossible films lack.\n\nMusic: It's by Lorne Balfe so of course it's amazing\n\nAction: Some of the best action scenes in the franchise and of course Tom Cruise does it for real which leads to some great camera shots. The bathroom fight scene with Tom and Henry was amazing with terrific choreography. The HALO dive was shot phenomenally , the motorcycle chase sequence was much more tense compared to the previous one and the helicopter scene in general was amazing. While none of the stunts top that of the Dubai scene in \"Ghost Protocol\" it was still almost as good and there are 3-4 of them in this film.\n\nOverall: This is no doubt one of my favourite movies of this year and is something no one should miss",

Once it starts it rarely slows down as we see Tom Cruise jump out of a plane, fight in a bathroom, jump off a building, crash a helicopter and many more crazy stunts. And that is where he movie overwhelmingly succeeds. Henry Cavill does a decent job as does the rest of the cast. The score is fun and the plot is fine.

The commitment this guy has to bringing his audience the most spectacular stunts is second to none.  This film is no exception with bone crunching fight scenes and 2 knuckle gnawing chase sequences, one on a motorbike and one in a helicoptor. \nI only took note of this franchise from number 3 onwards when JJ Abrams company Bad Robot took over proceedings.  The first 2 films no longer seem like they are part of the same franchise, the style of both are very different. Number 3 has always been my favourite, Ghost Protocol and Rogue Nation were both decent but paled in comparison to 3 which was mostly down to Phillip Seymour Hoffman's excellent bad guy.   Fallout is now probably my second favourite and in some ways the story is linked to number 3 which is maybe why i enjoyed it so much.  The usual supporting cast were good but the one new addition who stood out was Henry Cavill, playing a brutal enforcer for the CIA and Superman really does pack a punch in this one.  Very impressed with this latest addition to the franchise.",

            "content": "My review on Mission Impossible: fallout\n\nStory : Customary action packed plot. Race against time. Finding the missing plutonium explosives. Nothing complicated or head scratching moments, except for few twists and turns that demands attention to the plot.\n\nDirectorial and acting department :\n\nChristopher McQuarrie started off his career as a screen writer , one of his most popular works \"Usual suspects\" which won him an Oscar for best original screenplay. This movie kicked off as a basic 33 pages of seeded script, McQuarrie developed the script along side the production process and he is that capable. There are many characters.But, Would only like to discuss on Ethan hunt aka Tom cruise, Ilsa aka Rebecca Ferguson, Henry Cavill aka August Walker and Julia aka Michelle Monaghan. Ethan's char in this movie has layers, he is dissolved into this game of IMF Vs CIA Vs Rebellious groups, to an extent that he suffers from ambiguity against his own morale, what's right, where's the limit that has to be drawn and the anxiety attacks that he suffers worrying about the one he loves and them being in danger because of the kind of work he's involved in. In short the movie revolves around Ethan's character which is him fighting against the physical world by fighting against his own conscience(here goes redundancy). The love between Ethan and Julia's characters is one of the most matured and well understood relationship I've seen in the recent times of Cinema. Ilsa is nothing but a female Ethan hunt apart from catalysing the plot she serves as a full circle in Ethan's personal life. Henry Cavill? he's just okay a decent foe.\n\nTechnical Aspects :\n\nThe color grading is more saturated in MI series gives that muddy feel.Action scenes are spectacular\nHalo jump(A fuzzy ride), washroom fist fight(uninterrupted Long take and well choreographed ), Bike Chase in Paris here I would like to heed the sound design, especially in this Chase scene Tom cruise rides bike against the traffic you clearly hear the Doppler effect you literally can hear blue shift (compact sound molecules) and red shift (distant sound molecules). And the same effect amplified, when Ilsa cruises through the closed pillared road on bike. Just spectacular and visually satisfying.Even during the Halo jump scene when the lighting strikes the BGM goes mute.\n\nBox Office: \nIt's been 22 years since the first MI movie released (1996), None of the 5 movies grossed $700+ million, The maximum was made by MI:4 $690+ million. Right now the franchise is worth $2.5+ billion. I am guessing this movie will end up making $750-$800 million total in it's whole run at the B.O",

The story itself at first seems to be taking the viewer through a maze and we anxiously await gasping twists and turns... but the story seems to come up a bit short as if it couldn't decide where to turn & so just keeps sprinting straight through relying mostly on adrenaline vs. the \"smart, forward thinking, gotcha, control every outcome\" surprises. Those \"gotcha\" moments still exist in the film, but not in satisfying crescendo that we have come to love from MI franchise. Leaving the film to feel more like \"Bourne\" movie than a Miision movie. But maybe MI felt like such \"foolery\" has been thoroughly played out, and the film just wanted to show us Ethan's determination and personal drive is what saves the day. Bottom line: excellent action movie, extremely satisfying and exhilarating, very impressive and admirable fight scenes and stunts. Opting for action adrenaline more than clever suspense & surprise",

Tom Cruise continues his intense run as Ethan Hunt, and allowed to give him some extra shades this time as he starts to question how far he is willing to go to win.  He gets great support from the rest of the cast, with new addition bringing nice physicality and menace as CIA operative, Walker (in a nice twist, Cruise let's Cavill even physically tower over him).  Behind the camera, Christopher McQuarrie crafts a slick, fast-paced thriller with some of the best action sequences of the series, from bathroom fights to the helicopter chase, made all the more brilliant by being done with practical effects, often with Tom Cruise front and center (seriously, this is proof the man is really crazy).  Unfortunately, McQuarrie's attempts to add more levels to the story, from Hunt's guilt over his past actions to how far someone should be willing to go to save the world, never pan out.  It doesn't help most of the twists are predictable (you see the villain a mile away) and when the bad guys are revealed, they aren't that compelling (Sean Harris returns as Solomon Lane, but while still creepy, isn't given much to do).  Overall, still a fun and exciting action movie and one definitely worth seeing in IMAX (spend the extra few bucks if one is available) but still hasn't surpassed \"MI 3\".",

Speaking of the music, it was definitely minimal but effective. The acting was pretty great as well and kept the movie going in the in-between action scenes.

One moment where the hero makes a decision. It wasn't the decision I had a problem with but what happened immediately after that. Hunt makes his decision and then walks away from the car, NO ONE WOULD HAVE DONE THAT!  Secure the package and then make sure that what you knew was the right decision  was actually that. The whole freakin' movie is based on that one second. Not only that but WTF was up with the plot, the scene where Hunt meets up in private with the CIA director felt like a, \"uh, we gotta put this in\" moment after the movie had been screened. And speaking of CIA, I know Angela Bassett can act, but what the hell was that. I didn't feel a word of what she said. It was like I expected her to say, \"just kidding, nah man, i'm just playing.\" after every line. And don't tell me that plot wasn't sort of confusing, the decoy in the bathroom almost killed the guy he was supposedly decoying for. What would have happened if he really did? The whole back end of the movie would have been meaningless. The 15 mins, and if you saw the movie you know what I'm talking about, literally went on for 45 mins real time. The ending was so unlikely it really literally was Mission Impossible. There are so many confusing questions in this movie to me, I am obviously the idiot here because 224 of the 230 experts loved the movie Its certified fresh! What did I like? The White Widow. Venessa Kirby (You've seen her in the Crown as Princess Margaret in The Crown) is a stud up and comer. She plays a perfect villain-love interest. She could actually be a bond girl that knows how to act. Also loved Sean Harris as crazy guy. Overall the movie is fun, its a eye candy see it in the theater movie. But 97%? Nah.",

            "content": "So far, this summer's action and adventure films have been very boring. However, Mission: Impossible - Fallout is far from boring. It's full of adrenaline-pumping action! I believe that this is the best summer action / adventure film of the year and the best Mission Impossible film to date.\n\nIn this film, we see Ethan Hunt (Tom Cruise) as he receives a mission he chooses to accept, but fails to complete, because of an ambush. As a result, Ethan and his IMF team must work together with the CIA and other familiar allies to stop Solomon Lane (Sean Harris), John Lark (Henry ) and his group, known as the Apostles, from trying to execute a nuclear threat to the world.\n\nWhat I really enjoyed about this film are the sound designs, stunts, plot, cast and all the mind-blowing illusions IMF uses to trick the bad guys. I must say, the sound design is fantastic. The audio for explosions and gunshots sound authentic. It sounds so real that I felt as if I was in the scene. The stunts are intense because, if you don't already know, Tom Cruise does all of his stunts. When he performs them, it is hard to watch since he jumps off of many things such as planes and buildings. I felt so nervous that these stunt are real. The stunts are so nerve racking because most of the movie isn't made with CGI's, so most of the stunts are done exactly how the movie shows it. The story is very interesting. I like that you really don't need to see the other films to understand what goes on in this one.\n\nThe cast overall is superb. Simon Pegg and Ving Rhames are excellent as the IMF, since every delivery is spot on. I like that Benji is the most nervous character and you feel what he feels when a dangerous event happens. Also I enjoyed the performance of Sean Harris, who really brings in the mystery of this character, since he doesn't speak a lot until the end of the film. Rebecca Ferguson, as Ilsa Faust, makes a great curious assassin, since she always goes the opposite way of the IMF and always finds something different and important, which helps the IMF. Also, Angela Bassett and Alec Baldwin's performances as Erica and Alan are fantastic. I like how their relationship is shown as contradictors, because they both argue their own points. It is a shame we don't get to see more of this in the film. Henry Cavill, as August Walker, is also fantastic. I like how Ethan and August have different ideas about what they should do in the missions and they both try to incorporate their ideas, but those ideas come at a cost.\n\nI really like how each scene feels more intense than the last scene. At one point, I thought that the movie was going to end a certain way and I was so nervous about what was going to happen that I almost fell out of my seat. Finally, what I extremely like about this movie is the tricks the IMF use to trick the bad guys. In certain scenes I was surprised that it was an illusion. My favorite illusion is the masked one where Benji wears a mask that allows him to look like anyone.\n\nThis movie had a lot of great things going for it. The only thing I did not like about it is that it shows way too much in its trailer. However, it is fantastic. I give it 5 out of 5 stars and recommend it to people who like action / adventure and thriller movies. I recommend it gor ages 13 to 18, as well as adults.\n\nReviewed by Ryan R., KIDS FIRST!

            "content": "Mission Impossible Six. A lot of things are \"falling\" upon us this summer. From Jurassic Park's Fallen Kingdom to Mission Impossible's Fallout.  Good news in this case: The latter is way better than former. You can read my review of the Fallen Kingdom down below. Mission Impossible is one of those series that has somehow managed to not fall apart at the seams despite the many sequels--in much the same manner 007 James Bond films do. Aren't we grateful? Mission Impossible films never seem to disappoint and neither does Fallout. The action, suspense and even some emotional elements are amped up here in Fallout. It is as if the series took a 5-hour energy binge (and you might feel like the movie was 5 hours long, but you won't mind--you'll be glad). My favorite Mission Impossible films are MI:1, MI:3, and Ghost Protocol. It is too early for me tell where this one fits in the running, but it still doesn't beat those three for me. The first film of course is your first love, you cannot deny its charm and its first kiss. You had such great characters played by the likes of John Voigt, Vanessa Redgrave as Max and others. It was superb spy adventure bliss. Mission Impossible 3 was great because of the new additions and great use of the following elements; Simon Peg and Jeremy Renner, the face rendering technology and the amping of action. The humor, high tech and ramping up of action made those two films.\n\n \n\nFallout does not disappoint either. Far from it. There is an uptick with the action, suspense, and twist and turns that keep you wanting you more. I'm not exaggerating. Somehow they managed to do it even if at times they sacrafice believability.  It is on a level that is greater than other films in the series in this regard. When you think you have seen it all, you will find yourself admitting you were wrong. There are some real gasping, nail-biting and jaw dropping scenes too. Fallout director Christopher McQuarrie who directed Rogue Nation is back, and he brings in some elements we aren't used to (references and characters from prior films, and even more encounters with Hunt's estranged wife). These are very pleasant, if not heartwarming surprises that none of the other films have. There are scenes with helicopters and mountain ranges that are memorable in their own right. Who knew you could do all that with a helicopter but you will be wincing more than once.  Nevertheless, there is one small drawback here. All these elements with the increase in action and twists did not leave the film with much room for humor. The humor comes in the second half of the film and fell a bit flat for me. I will admit some others in the theater did laugh out loud but I didn't. Our two adorable modern day Laurel and Hardy agents played by Simon Pegg and Ving Rhames are largely absent in the early portion of the film until about the middle. When they are back, their humor is mediocre. Jeremy Renner isn't present at all (he was on the Avenger's Infinity War set). The absence of the three of them in the film is noticeable. We are used to them being there since the start of MI: 3 and as intense as the scenes are, we need their humor and partnership. There is too much high stakes running for the humor to have time to land and when Peg and Rhames do re-arrive, the humor dribbles in here and there. Another small drag on the film is some believability. We all get that this is fiction but the amount of physical running we are supposed to believe Hunt does in this film, with leaping over buildings like Spiderman all the way across town goes way beyond what any of the other films do. When there's a lot of action, we are all too distracted to think about believability. It's easier to suspend belief because we are being \"wow\"'ed. When all we are doing is watching Tom Cruise run through gorgeously filmed landscapes, as cool as the backdrop is, there comes a point where we aren't distracted enough to ignore that no one but a superhero could run that fast, that many miles at full speed and then leap over and through buildings. It edges itself a little over the believability radar when there is not much else happening to distract us.  Excuse the pun, but it appears and feels \"impossible\". However, these two elements are a small nuance.  It doesn't ruin the film nor make it 'impossible' to enjoy, but it doesn't make it the best either. Still, another great installment in a rather lack luster summer season. With dinos for sale at auction and mutant shark named Meg swimming about theater waters, this film is a much-needed thrill and delight. \nThe story starts us on a Mission that ultimately fails to retrieve the intended item because Hunt decides to save one of his crew instead, Luther play by the incomparable Ving Rhames. He is as much a staple to the film as Tom Cruise himself. When things amp up about the failure of Hunt at retrieving three plutonium orbs, Hunt takes things into his own hands once again while the CIA questions his loyalty and motives. Thus, soon Hunt is being hunted and watched by the CIA through Agent August Walker, played by the mouth watering Henry Cavill.  Despite saving his life, August clearly has other motives that aren't seen readily.  Meanwhile, Hunt is on a chase for an old enemy from Rogue Nation, Solomon Lane. August Walker and the CIA have their own interest in Lane as well. Lane is an ex-operative who became an anarchist, imprisoned and tossed around from government to government. Since the last film, Lane is somehow hoping and manipulating things to happen so that Hunt is forced to get his hands on him. Hunt hopes by capturing Lane that he can stop a new league of terrorists called The Apostles who Lane has spearheaded. However, Lane is blinded by an apocalyptic ending for himself and Hunt. The Apostles just merely want to end the world system through nuclear explosions. Pick your poison? Hunt has to deal with them both if he wants to save the world. It's a triad of dangers when you throw in the CIA which intersects Ethan Hunt everywhere he goes. Hunt and his team are on a race against time to prevent a global catastrophe, but they get far more than bargained for in this one. This mission once again tests them all to the limit. Yes, even further than we have seen before in the series so far.\n\nSee a further breakdown at my website GotWords.org",

        {
            "content": "There's an old joke, first said about the original Mission: Impossible TV series which asks how we can continue to describe the tasks undertaken by these heroes as 'impossible' if they manage to successfully complete them week after week. This question is even more applicable to the barely connected film series of the same name where the stakes keep getting raised, the odds ever more unlikely, and the risks taken even more ludicrous with every release. With each film, the 'Mission: Impossible' part of each instalment's title seems to refer less to the adventure that the characters go on than it does to the challenge of finding a danger great enough to trouble our protagonist, Ethan Hunt. There's a famously impossible philosophical question which asks what would happen if an unstoppable force was to run straight into an immovable object. At times the Mission: Impossible movie series feels like an endless futile search for an obstacle big enough to finally stop, or even slow down, the unstoppable force that is Tom Cruise.\n\nCruise is something of a contradiction. Since he first appeared on screen as a young man, his good looks, natural charm and intense charisma made him in instantly recognisable on-screen presence. By the time of the first Mission: Impossible movie, back in 1996, it felt almost as if he was perfectly designed in a factory somewhere for the sole purpose of being the flawless example of a modern day 'movie star.' However, in the years which followed, that metaphor felt a little too accurate as Cruise's onscreen 'perfection' started to feel somewhat artificial. As Cruise aged, his incandescent confidence ceased to be merely the cocksure attitude of youth and increasingly started to feel more like the vainglorious assuredness of religious fervour. (It's no coincidence that this perception began to take hold around the same time as Cruise's involvement in the Church of Scientology started to become a subject of public discourse.) He is still, obviously, a major star and commands the screen powerfully, but his attempts to continue playing loveable, everyman heroes increasingly fall flat while many of his best roles have been morally questionable supporting parts, if not outright villains (think Interview With The Vampire, Magnolia, Collateral, hell even Tropic Thunder). Directors of major action blockbusters aren't always sure exactly what to do with Cruise (the Mission: Impossible series alone has changed director, along with tone and style, no less than five times across six movies so far). However, the Mission: Impossible films have started to become increasingly beloved by critics and audiences. Despite varying wildly in their casts, plotting and the way in which they are executed, the Mission: Impossible films are all united in their fascination with the legend of Ethan Hunt. Often mistaken for a characterless cypher, Hunt is (as Alec Baldwin calls him in 2015 'Rogue Nation') the living manifestation of destiny. Hunt is a force of nature. Hunt is a fucking madman. But he's our madman. The trailers shouldn't say 'Tom Cruise is Ethan Hunt' because that would be redundant. Ethan Hunt is Tom Cruise.\n\nAnd Cruise, as expected, gives everything to the role. The stunts in Mission: Impossible - Fallout are simply unbelievable. Cruise famously broke his ankle during production while jumping between rooftops (and completed filming the scene before getting medical help) but by the time that death defying stunt actually appears on screen it feels like a fairly regular, everyday occurrence compared to the utterly insane risks already taken in earlier (and later) scenes. It's not just surprising that Cruise managed to avoid injuring himself worse, it's simply staggering that he is still walking around, and breathing, after production on all this mayhem wrapped. The most jaw-dropping of these involves Hunt partaking in a HALO (High Altitude Low Opening) parachute jump to arrive covertly at a heavily guarded event. All credit must be given to (Camera Operator) Craig O'Brien, who had to to not only follow Cruise all the way to the ground, but keep him in perfect focus the whole time while careening towards the Earth at 180mph from the cruising height of a 747. The audience should be given oxygen canisters too just to keep them breathing while watching it.\n\nDespite being the longest, and probably the most convoluted, in the franchise, it would be an understatement to say that Mission: Impossible - Fallout moves fast. Having already established most of it's main cast and their relationships in the previous movies, it barrels straight into action, stacking set pieces on top of each other and constantly moving forward at breakneck speed. There's also a certain confidence to the directing on show which no doubt comes from Christopher McQuarrie becoming the first director to helm a second movie in this series. Everything about this film is trying to be bigger, bolder and braver than it's predecessors. (Case in point, Fallout is not just the only film in the series to feature dream sequences but has Hunt vaporised by a nuclear blast, Terminator 2 style, in one of them.) Much like the fun, if more lowbrow, Fast and The Furious series, the Mission: Impossible films took until their fourth chapter to really feel like they'd found a voice they were comfortable with. McQuarrie clearly understands how to deliver it exactly as audiences expect. If there is a flaw to this it's that the lack of a new hand at the wheel has prevented the film from having anything resembling a unique style or character of it's own. Mission: Impossible - Fallout feels much more like a direct sequel to Mission: Impossible - Rogue Nation than a mere installment in a larger series. Almost all of the main cast of that film return and this one resembles it in plot, character, theme and style. Apart from featuring a final sequence that combines explosive spectacle with ticking clock tension better than any of the previous climaxes, the biggest difference between Mission: Impossible - Fallout and it's immediate predecessor is that it doesn't have as many moments of lighthearted humour to balance the constant gloomy shadow of shady espionage and doom-laden terrorism.\n\nDespite the twisty narrative: full of betrayals, warring agencies and double crosses; there are no real surprises here and most of the major reveals are more likely to inspire shrugs than gasps. There are nods to each of the previous films in the series though, and there is a sense in both of McQuarrie's releases that he is using these films to try and reconcile the first four movies (which often feel like they could come from parallel dimensions to each other) into one coherent timeline.\n\nSo what is new? Vanessa Kirby appears as a secretive arms dealer known as the White Widow, a kind of younger, sexier update to Vanessa Redgrave's 'Max' from the first movie. Angela Bassett plays Erica Sloane, the head of the CIA, becoming the latest great actor to bring extra gravitas to the series by playing a disapproving authority figure. But the new cast member who has gained the most press is Henry Cavill. He plays August Walker, a CIA assassin tasked with keeping tabs on Ethan and his team to prevent them from yet again going rogue in the line of duty. Cavill is yet to convincingly display the kind of onscreen personality required for roles like Superman (which he plays for the DC Extended Universe) but here he is mostly tasked with appearing like a massive human brick wall with a moustache. At that, he is perfect. He towers over most of the cast and he somehow appears to reload his arms before charging at opponents like a solid iron battering ram. Also, it is a luxurious moustache.\n\nThe violence in the film is one of it's strong points. The fight scenes are the best of the series so far and each punch or kick has solid weight behind it and lands with a visceral crunch. However, up until the film's (frankly brilliant) final chase/fight/bomb diffusion sequence, there isn't that much sense of real human peril. Sure, the action sequences are excellent, shot with clarity and vision and keep you on the edge of your seat with ingenious reversals of fortune. However, although you are often left wondering how the characters could possibly get out of their predicament, you never really feel that, this time, they simply might not. And that, ultimately, is the film's biggest weakness. There's a running joke throughout the film where character's are asked what their plan is and they can only reply \"We're working on it\" suggesting that they are simply winging things half the time and hoping that luck will carry them to safety. (By this point Ethan Hunt resembles the bumbling, overconfident, parody spy Sterling Archer as much as he resembles the suave James Bond type.) Unfortunately their confidence is contagious, leaving you with a certainty that things will somehow work out in the end.\n\nLike it's lead characters, Mission: Impossible - Fallout is running at full tilt, creating startlingly smart and confident solutions as it goes. It's a ballsy, efficient and powerful piece of action filmmaking that understands how to build character and forward plot while on the move. It supplies truly outstanding white-knuckle thrills and just enough spy intrigue to keep things interesting in the downtime. However, it still can't quite complete the impossible mission of making you truly emotionally connect with these characters enough to fear deeply for their safety.\n\nFrom MOGULAMANIA:\nhttps://mogulamania.blogspot.com/2018/07/new-release-review-mission-impossible.html",

I understand the writer main point, he experimented to  give more time for every action develop in order to create a situation of suspense. But it make the movie too slow for me and too many talking. At least everybody have a lot of time. The trailer spoil the character of Henry Cavill, nothing importante, and I still dont understand why he cannot just shave his mustache. But anyway, good movie, good sound. Maybe the best Ving Rhames dramatic performance. Paris was beautiful one time but its looks bad. A happy ending.

I was right as this movie takes what's great about Rogue Nation, and amplifies it by 100. The action scenes and stunts are breath taking and stunning, such as the helicopter chase in the finale and the HALO jump at the beginning. Tom Cruise gives the a more emotional performance as we see that he is not perfect and how throughout the movie he is making mistakes, to show he is flawed. We also get to see that he won't be willing to let a man die. Henry Cavill was amazing as a CIA/Apostle and he really fought great. The movie bounces all over the place and while that can be a good thing, sometimes it feels too bloated. But this film is an amazing piece of cinema and this the best Mission Impossible movie, one of Cruise's best movies and performances, and one of the best action films of all time.",

The action scenes are so tense and ridiculously insane and the finale is absolutely mind-blowingly awesome. The one problem I have with this movie is that one of my favorite characters from the last two movies William Brandt (Jeremy Renner) is not in this movie and would have fit perfectly here as Ethan's ally yet foil, but this movie does not suffer too much from his absence. 9.95/10",

            "content": "Mission Impossible: Fallout (5 out of 5 stars). Mission Impossible: Fallout is an awesome, exciting action packed sequel that shows Tom Cruise is up for more crazy stunts. From jumping out of an HALO plane, being chased on a motorcycle in Paris, running and jumping on rooftops in London, and flying an helicopter and being caught in a dogfight. These movies get better through sequels and I am not complaining that they should stop. Each movie gets better and tops the one before. Fallout is probably the best one out of six movies now. Sure, I find Tom Cruise climbing the burj khalifa to be the most intense stunt and the motorcycle chase scene in Rogue Nation to be well done and the best action sequence. Fallout in general has a lot going for it. From a plot that has a lot of pieces moving with characters betraying another. Double and triple crosses with each other. But it all makes sense in the end when everything is pieced together. The plot follows Ethan Hunt (Tom Cruise) and his team Benji (Simon Pegg) and Luthor (Ving Rhames) are on a mission trying to retrieve stolen nuclear devices. When the mission goes awry and Ethan has to face the consequences of saving ones life over millions. They are forced to have a shadow from the CIA with August Walker (Henry Cavill) tagging along with them on there missions. While a terrorist group called The Apostles are after the nuclear devices. A lot more goes on with the plot which makes it better. But the less you know before going to see it, the better. There are a few twists that will surprise you. Characters wearing masks and fooling the audience that will leave you surprised. And a few triple crosses. Yes, Ilsa Faust (Rebecca Ferguson) returns with her own agenda that may interfere with Hunt's mission. The movie is loaded with action packed set pieces throughout. I will consider this to be the best action movie of the year so far. Definitely, a summer blockbuster type of movie while it is keeping you thinking and focused on its heavy-handed plot. Writer/Director Christopher McQuarrie does well with topping each action scene over the one before that. From a HALO jump scene that is dizzying and crazy. To a brutal fight scene in the bathroom at a club. To a convoy breakout that leads Ethan being chased by the police with more bad guys after him while Faust is hot on his trail as well. To an overlong rooftop running scene that shows Tom Cruise can jump and sprint for long distances. Then, the climatic finale with Tom Cruise being in an aerial combat dogfight while flying a helicopter which is dizzying and thrilling but the best aerial combat scene shot on film. Tom Cruise is at his best again. Henry Cavill is a great addition as well playing a character that is hard to trust. Ving Rhames and Simon Pegg are still good. Pegg having more hands on action this time. Rebecca Ferguson is great playing a character that is difficult on trusting but has feelings for Ethan while they have different agendas on their mission. Sean Harris returns with that monotone voice but is still menacing. Alec Baldwin was great too with having more confidence in Ethan's actions and choices even though he does not show it. The music score Lorne Balfe was also good and helped create the tone of the movie which is a bit darker. His score almost sounds similar to Hans Zimmer. Overall, Mission Impossible Fallout is a great film. If you are into the series or not. This film will definitely win newcomers. The action sequences are top notch exciting and thrilling. There is a lot of action from beginning to end. The cast is great. The plot is all over the place but works well with the twist and turns. Tom Cruise is not holding back with stunts. This 2 and half hour film does feel short when the pace flies so fast with its busy plot and non stop action. You may finally catch a breath when it is over.",

            "content": "Mission: Impossible is a franchise that, much like its protagonist Ethan Hunt, just doesn't quit. While the first three entries in the film series ranged from \"alright\" to \"pretty meh,\" the most recent three films have set new high bars for action films and have exhibited some of the most impressive stunts ever done for a movie. Ghost Protocol and Rogue Nation are two of my favorite films and have showcased Tom Cruise at his best and most daring. Fallout continues this trend. You would think that a franchise that is six films in would have started to slow down, but Mission: Impossible has impossibly kept the momentum and excitement with its most recent entry.\n\nMission: Impossible - Fallout features the same actors and characters that have become familiar to fans of the series. Tom Cruise is of course back as Ethan Hunt, the skilled and seasoned agent of IMF (Impossible Mission Force) who has prevented world-changing disasters more times than he probably ever wanted to. Cruise is somehow still at the top of his game in Fallout, and it's hard not to respect the man for the dedication he gives to his craft. As per usual, the insane stunts that you see Hunt perform in the film are done by Cruise himself, and this is something that continues to bolster the film's already-incredible action. Shots of Cruise piloting a helicopter through mountains, jumping from a C17, or leaping across buildings look completely real because they ARE completely real. Even though he's getting old (56 years old as of July 2018), I hope he continues to do what he does for just a few more years.\n\nCruise is joined by many of the franchise's recurring favorite characters. Ving Rhames returns as Luther Stickell, who is finally given more to do in the film and serves as a permanent member of the IMF team of agents rather than as a brief cameo or supporting role. Simon Pegg is back as Benji Dunn, another IMF agent, and Pegg does an excellent job again even though the writing dials back the character's humor this time around. Rebecca Ferguson continues her role as Ilsa Faust, an MI6 agent and love interest (?) of Hunt's, and she delivers another convincing performance. Henry Cavill joins the cast of Fallout as well, portraying a tough and burly CIA assassin who is tasked by the CIA's director (Angela Bassett) to supervise the IMF team. Every performance in Mission: Impossible - Fallout is superb, and no one (except for Cruise) really outshines the others. This is especially important when considering the team dynamic in the film, something that Ghost Protocol in particular nailed on the head. Everyone on the IMF team feels as capable as the rest, and each contributes their own unique skills and personality that make them compelling and worthy additions to the team.\n\nNow let's get into the meat of the film: the action. The Mission: Impossible franchise has always been about the high-stakes, edge-of-your-seat, nail-biting action. This is something that Fallout doubles down on, and I can confidently say that it features the best action of the franchise. I'll even venture to say that it features some of the best action of all time. Its hand-to-hand combat sequences are brutal: the edits and camera angles bring out the force of every punch, kick, jab, and block, and the fight choreography is directed beautifully. Vehicular chase scenes are filmed in a way that you never lose track of where characters are in relation to each other and the landscape feels familiar and easy to follow. Gunfights are intense and made powerful by the sound editing and cuts. The action is simply marvelous to behold and assembled masterfully by a director, Christopher McQuarrie, who proves that he has harnessed his craft. These scenes, which are memorable to say the least, have been replaying in my head over and over since I walked out of the theater, giving me the urge to watch the film again.\n\nAside from the film's stellar action, the other aspects of Mission: Impossible - Fallout are great as well. The writing is superb. It fills the plot with twists and turns that keep you on the edge of your seat (and probably confuse you a bit). It adds development to characters in ways that you wouldn't expect from an action film. It also makes the most ridiculous things seem plausible and believable in the film's context, something I cannot elaborate on without spoiling things. The acting, as I already mentioned, is top-notch, and the entire cast contributes greatly to the movie. The cinematography is excellent as well: beautiful wide shots of cities, mountains, and landscapes are present throughout, and the camerawork during the film's most gut-wrenching moments enhances the intensity and emotion.\n\nCan I name any flaws with Mission: Impossible - Fallout? I have one, single flaw that comprises a single second of the film. There is a single shot of computer-generated rocks tumbling over the edge of a cliff, and this shot looked really bad, like something out of a 1980s video game.\n\nThat's it. The only real flaw with Mission: Impossible - Fallout is a second-long, unfinished CGI shot. You could argue that the film's twists and turns that I mentioned could be too much or be too confusing, but that is purely a preferential issue with the film and one that did not affect me. One could also point out the clich\u00e9d last-second resolutions that happen a few times and the deus ex machina that is scattered throughout, but I honestly thought these were handled so well in the script that they were not a problem at all.\n\nMission: Impossible - Fallout is the rare action film that is smartly written, beautifully directed, well-acted, memorable, and an absolute joy to watch. This is the first film I have seen all summer that I've loved and had no significant issues with. Without a doubt it is the best film in the franchise and one of the best action films I have ever seen, and I have every intention of seeing it again, buying it on Blu-Ray, and convincing as many people as possible to see it. This is a franchise that I hope continues to pump out excellent films as long as Tom Cruise is willing to work on them. Rest assured that you will find me in line to see it on its opening night whenever it is released. Mission: Impossible - Fallout gets 5 out of 5 stars.",

Though I think Christopher McQuarrie has seem the 1993 Sylvester Stallone movie \"Cliffhanger\" because I saw some similarities in this movie's climax that reminded me of Stallone's action thriller.  I was never bored despite the two hour plus running time.  However there was one liability here:  Henry Cavill.  He just did not work for me in his role as CIA operative August Walker.  Also plottwists that were supposed to surprise the audience can be seen from a mile away.  Still I liked this movie enough to recommend it.

Seriously, this film's story is so smart - I love that about this franchise. Being a large summer blockbuster, it doesn't just throw action at you for the sake of action. You have to pay attention to the story, every spoken line, in order to follow along with the plot points. There are so many surprises, excellent twists and turns, but wow the action in this, the sixth film in this franchise, is out of this world.\n\nPerfect interactions between each character, everyone is amazing here. Tom Cruise as Ethan Hunt, this man is still a monster. What can't this guy do? All of the insane stunts he does, at such a fast pace, top notch physical performance here. Of course Ving Rhames and Simon Pegg are incredible as usual, but Henry Cavill I have a strange connection with.

Now when it comes to the Mission Impossible series the odd numbered movies have always been great, the even numbered ones not so much (Still wish I could erase MI2 out of existence). I'm happy to say that Fallout has broken the streak of bad even numbered MI movies.\nNow thats not to say its one of the best. The movie DID NOT have to be TWO AND A HALF HOURS LONG. I really wish they had trimmed it down and made it tighter. Fallout is basically a follow up to the last MI movie (which is by far my favorite). Sadly even though it had the same director, given its heavy run time, the movie frequently stalls between action set pieces. Some action sequences go on to long, especially the one at the end which from a story perspective is just damn silly.\nStill its a fun movie, worth the $15 (not $20 in IMAX). It is not just a mindless popcorn flick. What lets me down is that everything was there to make it one of the better Mission Impossibles, its just so bloated that the good stuff gets lost in unnecessary excessiveness. They REALLY needed an editor with more of a backbone.\nMy MI movies from best to worst:\nMI: Rogue Nation\nMI:3\nMission Impossible\nMI: Fallout\nMI: Ghost Protocol\n(MI: 2 would be at the bottom but I still choose to believe it doesn't exist.)",

        {
            "content": "Whether you personally believe in this notion or not, the Mission: Impossible franchise has been on an upward trajectory for years. With the release of the first film entertaining action fans and Tom Cruise fans alike, it was inevitable that a sequel would be made. Personally, I think the second film easily could have sunk this franchise easily. Mission: Impossible 3 revitalized the franchise in terms of character and story and the rest is history. In terms of critical reception and fan appeal, this franchise is better than it has ever been. Mission: Impossible - Fallout has just hit the big screen and I would be lying to myself if I didn't give in and say this may be my favourite of the entire franchise. I know that's a bold statement, due to the fact that the previous two films were fantastic, but let's dive in.\n\nPicking up a couple of years after the events of Mission: Impossible - Rogue Nation, this is the first film in the franchise to directly continue a storyline from movie to movie. I was slightly wary of this notion, but I believe it worked very well. Following Ethan Hunt and his team after a failed mission, this team seeks out three orbs of plutonium, to prevent further, global catastrophe. While it seems like these are the MacGuffins of the story, Solomon Lane (the previous villain) also becomes a MacGuffin for the team, as he stirs up more trouble for them along the way. This is a very complex movie at times, which leads me to my only real complaint.\n\nAlthough this isn't technically a negative, because they pay everything off in a very nice way throughout the third act, it does feel like there is a little too much going on at times. The reason I don't find any of these movies absolutely perfect is due to the fact that they choose to be overly complex in their execution of certain storylines. From world-ending possibilities, to double-crosses, to bringing back previous storylines from past movies, and even to relying on an emotional core to the film that some viewers may not latch onto if they haven't seen the other movie, it can be quite the task of a movie to sit through. That being said, I'm a huge fan of this franchise and I was able to follow everything quite easily, so I think the execution of my possible, aforementioned complaints are only an issue if you haven't seen its predecessors.\n\nMission: Impossible - Fallout almost seems like a culmination of everything since the third movie and the action is just the icing on the cake. Although slightly ridiculous at times (which of these films isn't though), the action throughout this film is some of the best that this franchise has ever seen (in my opinion). From the hand-to-hand combat to the aerial chases, to the terrifically daring stunts, this is a sequel that doesn't pull any punches and satisfies in both storytelling and pure, adrenaline-fuelled excitement. At a pretty lengthy 147 minutes, I never once felt bored. That's probably due to the fact that I loved a lot more than just what was on its surface.\n\nChristopher McQuarrie returns from the previous film to direct and although each film has a history of switching directors, I believe he did a job worthy of continuing from the previous instalment. He, along with superb cinematography by Rob Hardy and a surprisingly fresh sounding score by Lorne Balfe, everything about my experience of this film was nothing short being utterly impressed. It's not very often that I find myself praising a movie for being near perfect on a technical level, as well as story and action, but Mission: Impossible - Fallout did it for me.\n\nIn the end, Mission: Impossible - Fallout at least deserves to be in the discussion for best of the franchise, even if you personally don't agree. If you can allow yourself to be completely immersed in a movie for nearly two and half hours, then I believe this may be one of the better moviegoing experience you'll have at the theatre this year. Aside from feeling a little too complex at times, there are many arcs that come full circle and I felt incredibly satisfied. Mission: Impossible - Fallout may not be an Oscar-contender, but I had an absolute blast with it and it's surely going to be included with some of my favourites of 2018.",

            "content": "I just want to put this out there:\n\nCRUISE + McQUARRIE = Match made in Action packed Heaven \n\nThe Mission Impossible movie series feels a lot like the Fast and furious (and I know its a strange connection) but with each movie it seems to find its footing and place and when it does it gets better and better and crazier with each movie and with this Latest Mission: Impossible Fallout this once again solitifies Tom Cruise as a beast when it comes to stunts and top notch action.....don't forget the running cause there's a lot of that too. The story provides just enough twist and turns to keep you occupied as well as putting you at the edge of your seat....only two mission: Impossible movies have done that in years and it wasn't M:I 2 (that crappy ass movie)!\n\nThe Story comes after the events of \"Rouge Nation\" where what's left of 'The Syndicate' is trying to find peace though chaos by stealing three nuclear cores and once again Ethan hunt (Tom Cruise) and the rest of his IMF team must go on a globe trotting adventure to stop a newly formed rouge nation from causing devastation on a massive scale; The story is something we have heard of before in any other typical spy thriller. But without spoiling anything the fun and the twists that come from this feels close and pays some homage to the series as well as the first movie without going overboard. In fact, It feels like throughout this movie that they take alot of elements from every Mission:Impossible movie here and there just to add on to the fun and the way the director and writers add these features its a beautiful mix worth watching.  \n\nI love how each character gets their time to shine more in this movie than any other M:I films well 1, 3, somewhat 4 and 5. I'm a big fan for Luther (Vhig Rhames) and I felt his character is under-utilized in at least 2 of these said movies and I was glad that he get's a much bigger role in this movie and in fact he feels moreso like the heart of the group the one that knows Ethan more than anyone being that he's been around him for years and both trust each other with their lives and i felt it showed much more in this more than a film like M:I 2, the Dynamic of the team is every bit as great than in any other film previous and you see how loyal they are to Ethan as Ethan is every bit as loyal to them and that's the human aspect which works so well in this movie cause at the end of the day its not always about Tom Cruise its about him and his team that works with him. Henry Cavill's Character of Walker was that 'Hammer\" the person who would do whatever it takes to stop the weapon and the fight scenes OMG the action sequences; I saw this in IMAX so the punches felt/Sounded Brutal and the action sequences like i said before proves that Tom is rising up there next to Jackie Chan in providing the best by doing his own stunt work; for a man pushing 50 he got what it takes to get a movie done right....now I can argue that Henry should have kept that beard for 'Justice League\" but that's neither here nor there! \n\nSo where's the flaw.....well 1) This movie should have been longer...lmao I wanted more I wanted more intensity that this movie put out. you had moments to take a breath and then the action kicked it...gives you a brief moment rest again and then ACTION OVERDRIVE and it was so good...it worked for every scene and it puts a sense of humanity Ethan's character cause you know he's not superhuman but he cares about the lives that he's willing to do what he can to save them. 2nd flaw....the final climax did feel a bit wash, rinse, repeat of itself....it felt like something you've already seen before and while this movie did a good job with the climax i couldn't help but to say to myself in the theater, \"you know how this will end\" and of course it ended that way so that was pretty much it. \n\nOverall, i will go as far and say this is the best in the series hands down!! \nwhile I do love the first movie and M:I 3 was mediocre but fun to say the least and the Ghost protocol and Rouge nation were the most fun; 'Fallout' pretty much says, \"hold my beer\" to its own franchise, Its fun, smart, intense, and while it falls into predictable territory towards the last act it still kept me wanting more from this movie. And with that I'm going to go see it again cause its damn worth it!!\n\n5/5 Stars\nI will add one more star for Tom Cruise doing his own DAMN STUNTS its amazing!! \nAnd another star for actually using the footage from that infamous rooftop scene of him limping that was really ballsy.......I LOVED it!!  \n\nBlack Guy that reviews movies...",

Yes, Cruise is back as spymaster Ethan Hunt in this sixth installment in the Mission Impossible franchise, this time leading his IMF team on a joint mission with a CIA assassin (Henry Cavill) to stop a terrorist group from launching a nuclear attack aimed at destroying a third of the world's population. This sequel has all the clich\u00e9d dialogue, contrived spy vs. spy cloak and dagger melodrama, and ridiculously over the top action sequences we've come to expect from the franchise over the years. And then there are the car chases. And foot chases. And helicopter chases. And probably other chases that we can't recall due to the pulse-pounding, mind-numbing sensory overload of action, that while entertaining, fails to mask a laughably silly, convoluted storyline that takes itself way too seriously. Cavill, however, is a nice, fresh addition to the film, as is the super charismatic Vanessa Kirby (Princess Margaret in Netflix's The Crown) as the sarcastic, knife-wielding White Widow. In all, a fun, albeit mindless, film that will likely self-destruct from your memory five seconds after leaving the theater. B- \u2014\u2014\u2014- TheReelness.com",

            "content": "As we all know, this is the sixth instalment of the franchise. Supposedly by this time, the series already started long to drag their wear and tear tires here and about, so within so without, sucking every preposterous and ridiculous ideas they can think of. However, Mission Impossible franchise has been one of the few to deny that statement, as the impossible becomes possible, as it suggests that statement is merely a myth, as the ideas never entirely run out, as the stunts are afresh and eye-catching but can this new instalment keep up with the others (putting aside the second one as if it never happens because the majority of us can agree it's the worst) or will it have a serious fallout?\n\nOne thing to talk about is the plot. It is superficially heavy this time, in fact the heaviest out of all the series. Plus, it is intertwined and ultra-complicated for a summer Hollywood movie that you will be exhausted after the 147 mins ride. What makes this successful is that it has that Oscar-worthy vibe and it solves the puzzles very neatly towards the end despite some revelations might come off as predictable. And before I forget to mention, this movie has a lot of deep connections with Rogue Nation (the 5th instalment). Watch the previous instalment before stepping into this new mission or you will hardly relate with the characters. And if you've had the time, revise the 3rd one too.\n\nNow, you must promptly be wondering, how about the stunts? Let me get to this part. THE... STUNTS... ARE... REAL! Every time you go in watching this best ongoing franchise in the world, you should bear in mind that CGI is a non-existent element. And the stunts are performed by Tom Cruise himself. The daring set pieces are well choreographed and acted in a way that looks real and genuine that puts most of this year's other action blockbuster movies to shame. The BATHROOM scene... will leave you in total shock. The PARIS scene... will make you gasp due to many unexpected moments... The ROOFTOP scene... will make you wonder which one that got Tom Cruise injured... The KASHMIR scene... will make your heart jitters and probably, pees in your pants because... THE STUNTS ARE ALL REAL!\n\nActing is well done, of course. Henry Cavill savors his swashbuckler swagness, Simon Pegg brings less comedy to the table but executes a more matured lad, Rebecca Ferguson has improved a lot since her debut in Rogue Nation, and she has lost a lot of weight that perfectly suits her role, Michelle Monaghan makes us miss her character so much and eventually, fall in love with her and Tom Cruise is anything good you can possible talk about. He is a legend!\n\nWhat I like is it plays a bit different this time in which there is less over-the-top artificial techs and more to realistic stunts that put the gadgets to rest this time. This is a classified mission where nothing is impossible in reality but it is impossible to commit because of how dangerous and menacing there are. \n\nThey opt on breathtaking locations as they fill with richness and intensity making the movie charges with a load of energy that transmits to the audience who becomes alive and fully realizes that this is the exact location without any usage of CGI.\n\nWhen the action scenes come in especially the Paris scene, the sound effect is top-notch; you can hear those tiny details of engineered sound system waving in the cinema hall, sucking the audience as if we are in the action movie ourselves.\n\nWhat I dislike is the repetitive dialogues by Tom Cruise, it is semi-cool and semi-irritating because he keeps saying the same phrases at every different location. It comes off as irritating but why is it cool is because sometimes, it uses the third-act solution technique in creating a storyline... and humor apparently.\n\nAnother thing I dislike is the scene when the theme song emerges on the big screen. Don't get me wrong... I love and salute the theme song. However, I hate it when it shows glimpses of scenes and stunts that about to happen afterwards followed by its chronological order. In my opinion, that is a big spoiler!\n\nAnd I dislike that they fail to tell Jeremy Renner's character whereabouts after Rogue Nation (as far as I can remember).\n\nTruth to be told, I wasn't a huge fan of the Mission Impossible series until... three months before this movie came out. I felt a whole energy down my spine and knew this is going to be a good one. Bloody hell! How wrong was I! It isn't just good, it is state-of-the-art masterpiece action blockbuster film.\n\nSo if I'm going to rank all the six impossible-made films, it would be: (From Best to Worst)\n\n6, 4, 3, 5, 1 and 2.\n\nIs there any hope for this franchise to survive in Hollywood? VERY POSSIBLE! Is there any story left that this franchise can get hold onto for the next instalment? POSSIBLE! Is there any chance you might doze off during the movie at any condition? IMPOSSIBLE! Is there any chance left that the stunts can get any better than Fallout? VERY IMPOSSIBLE!\n\nYour mission... should you choose to accept it is to see Mission Impossible: Fallout in theaters!\n\nOverall: 90/100\n\nThis message will self-destruct in 5 seconds...",

            "content": "*Spoiler Alert* Tom Cruise does run A LOT in the latest impossible mission. Not only is this mission possible, it is downright probable despite what any sort of contrived plot parameter demands it not be. Like any of the previous installments in this beloved action espionage franchise offer, we are treated to two and a half hours of nonstop setup and payoff. Double agents defy orders, single agents defy borders, hot triple agent action occurs in a bathroom stall for the Frenchmen to earnestly catcall, and the badman tries to nuke civilization for the Nth time. Despite how silly all of the dialogue is and despite how undercut the spy film tropes are for the sake of staying fresh, this is an awesome return to form for modern American action cinema.\n\nYou could sit there in your big boy chair tearing apart the screenplay like you rend your fried chicken tender flesh from its amalgamate finger form, but you would be doing yourself a disservice. Henry Cavill sacrificed his mustache credibility for this role, and damn you if you cant appreciate what he did it for. From the cold and deceptively prolonged opening sequence, to the first plot point where Ethan Hunt has to decide if he will defy utilitarianism, to the second plot point where Ethan Hunt has to decide that he WILL defy utilitarianism, we are ensured all sorts of daunting nuclear moral conundrums. But don't worry, he's such a stand up guy that not only will he choose his friends over his accepted mission or responsibility to ensuring the safety of millions but he'll sacrifice a crap ton of efficient use of screen time for a really awesome extended set piece. And let's face it, that's what we came here for.\n\nAnything you have heard about the action in this film is not overstated. I'll admit, there's a bit too much teal/amber for my taste in the cinematography, but the movie is damned beautiful (bar the editing of the scene in the club with White Widow - that kind of cut contrast is just gross looking). The action sequences are what justify this mainstream approach. After all, how else could you unify sky jumping through a thunderstorm, traffic chases through Paris, fist fights in a rave bathroom, and helicopteraphying the peaks of Kashmir? Doesn't matter, action man punched and shot his way out of authoritarian disillusionment and saved all of the plebs to spite them. Thank Xenu for Sweet Baby Action Christ: Tom Cruise.",

And while the the story is beautifully designed, something in the fun and heart of the series has been lost since \"Ghost Protocol.\"  Brad Bird's presence injected the franchise with a much needed dose of imagination--we saw cool gadgets, great gags, and very imaginative set pieces that raised the bar for Cruise and company.  But since Christopher McQuarrie has taken the helm, we have been treated to beautiful imagery and stunts that don't fully cohere.  There are pacing issues in both \"Rogue Nation\" and \"Fallout,\" action sequences that seem to end on a flat note and, yet, want you to interpret flatness as nothing less than cleverness.  There are moments where the sequences in \"Fallout\" seem to reach a state of transcendence for action cinema, until you realize that the scenes are not in fact transcending anything you haven't seen before; instead, they are allowing those moments to play longer than normal.   For me, the central flaw of this fiilm was returning to a villain we have seen before--in that, \"Fallout\" plays like the typical \"sequel\" that would have played in the 80s: Same characters, same general moments, slightly different plot.  In fact, one can almost replace \"Rogue Nation\" with \"Fallout\" and the franchise would be much better off for it.   As an ardent fan of \"The Mission Impossible\" film and television series, I always look forward to another movie installment.  There is so much satisfaction in character of Ethan Hunt to keep me coming back for more, even when the emotional engagement is contrived and artificial.  I hope the series returns to the type of balance of plot , gadgetry, and imagination that we saw in \"Ghost Protocol.\"   Otherwise, I'm not interested in seeing another mission crafted by McQuarrie.",

With each action sequence you believe Cruise more and more, it is safe to say now that Tom Cruise has truly become Ethan Hunt. The film is sensory euphoria with a core rooted in what we all want realism to be. McQuarries screenplay is filled with plot twists and deception to the viewer that could be perceived as cheesy but it is hard not to get caught up in this film.

I've only seen was Mission Impossible: Rogue Nation, and that's it. Along with this one, so it's my second movie for me. I need to see all of them in order to know what's really going on with the other plots to them. Rogue Nation is what got me interested in these series and I absolutely love them. Tom Cruise is a beast and he is such a great stuntman. I love the fact how the action sequences looked so practical, and there was hardly any use of CGI most of the time. like maybe 85-90% was real, while 10-15% was very little CGI. Even though they used a little bit of CGI, it wasn't that noticeable in any way since it already looked realistic. I enjoyed the heck out of this awesome movie. Tom Cruise still has it and wow, it's a miracle that he didn't fail the stunts, except with the one part on the rooftop where he was running and jumped off the edge of the ledge on a platform and bruised his ankle. That was insane how they kept that shot in the movie. That's why it does makes this movie look better and realistic because he actually did hurt himself while he was filming, and it proves that he's the man to do it and doesn't hesitate to do so. He doesn't mind taking any risks in his life. A very brave man I'm telling you. This was so amazing, and thrilling, and maybe is a better improvement from the others. It will have you off the edge of your seat and hell that was an awesome experience especially seeing it in 3D. Everything about it was great!!! Loved it!!",

The acting was great with a few powerful moments, but nothing that raises it to a +++ on its own. The innovation in Tom Cruise's stunt work is why the acting rating is rightfully brought up. The writing wasn't perfect but had good dialogue with an easy to follow story and minimal plot holes. There were some issues with pacing toward the beginning and maybe a few missteps in the middle, but in the end, managed to flow very well, which definitely serves its purpose in maintaining its suspense. Sound design and soundtrack are as great as ever, except for some music being a little too noticeable at times, making parts seem cheesy when they're taking the serious route.\nAll in all, Mission: Impossible - Fallout is beautiful, well acted and an intense and immensely enjoyable ride.

But this is where, McQuarrie; the writer-director, comes in and smartly makes it all glorifying for the audience to chew in the character's perspective easily. \n\nIt is rich on technical aspects like breathtaking camera work, stunning production design and alluring visuals. Addition to that, the choreography of all the chase or action sequences is so finely detailed and lethally performed that leaves the audience in an awe of it. \n\nWith all the buzz of the cast performing their own stunts; especially by Cruise, after a certain point, seems essential to get the audience enchanted into it and calculate the magnitude of the stakes projected in here and connect instantly. \n\nThe only two reason why the feature fails to enter the major league would be its lack of creativity on the concept and the poetic theme that seems to be the missing puzzle in here. Cruise is confident, mature and has evolved a lot on portraying the character where he may be vulnerable but not weak. \n\nPegg, Cavill, Ferguson and Rhames gets their own stand out moments which they hold on to it decently. Live Locations, exhilarating stunts, throat-slicing politics and Cruise at the heart of it are the high points of this feature that unflinchingly delivers. \n\nMission Impossible : Fallout is an exuberant extravaganza that plays with its audience like a mere 4 year old kid and the wise thing would be to nod along.",

Ving Rhames's talent and screen magnetism is especially wasted in service to this. Alec Baldwin isn't given anything special to do here, also wasted potential. But, boy, the skydive into Paris... the action scene in the bathroom... the rooftop chase scene... the scene where Ethan Hunt is posing as a terrorist and has to pretend to lead an organized and weaponized extraction of the world's top-fugitive from law-enforcement hands while simultaneously thwarting said extraction without blowing his cover... thrilling sequence.

Up until that point I was enjoying it immensely but thinking about it I would probably consider it to be the best in the franchise. Cruise performs some of the most dangerous stunts ever put to screen and for the most part they are pretty much grounded and thrilling. It was sad to see a \u201cFast and the Furious\u201d style ending which let it down. It didn\u2019t need it. The film pretty much collectively sums up all of Ethan\u2019s previous exploits and again puts the people he cares about in jeopardy. It\u2019s not very original but it\u2019s is slickly made and reminded me more of a Bond film. The chase sequences on motorbikes and on foot are nothing short of spectacular and Cruise\u2019s very publicized broken ankle sequence is still as shocking when you see it again on screen. Henry Cavill and his mustache put in fine performances as menacing CIA agents tasked with keeping an eye on Ethan. The action sequences on display here are sublime, it\u2019s just a shame that there\u2019s not a better plot to back them up. ",

The characters have really found their feet (hats off to Pegg and Rhames for their warmth), the story is complex enough without becoming alienating, and there's just enough twists without it becoming annoying (as in some MI's of the past). Great fun, and at times... jaw-dropping.",

Henry Cavil Is a good newcomer he's nothing special but he adds some fun back and forth. The way the plot unfolds in this movie is much more similar to the first MI film than any of the others. The best action scene in this film however is definitely the bathroom scene, it's a great scene with incredible choreography. If you haven't watched any of the Mission Impossible movies you probably shouldn't start with this one because this is really the first time an MI movie has connected back to its previous films. But you should definitely watch this film.",

For a man in his mid-50's to do stunts that most 20-30 year old actors wouldn't do themselves, speaks volumes to his dedication as an actor. Henry Cavill killed his role as August Wilson; Rebecca Ferguson and Simon Pegg were great supporting cast members but the most shocking to me was Ving Rhames. He had somewhat of an emotional arc that I wouldn't have seen coming from a mile away, but I was pleasantly surprised. My biggest take away from this film is that Chris McQuarrie, the Oscar winning writer, who wrote one of my favorite movies (The Usual Suspects), now has the potential to become one of the biggest action directors in Hollywood. I'm excited to see what his next project is. This film gets 4.5/5 for me.",

Director Christopher McQuarrie directs some of the most intense scenes I\u2019ve seen in a while. The film is also a masterclass in storytelling. All of the twists work yet you still don\u2019t know how the film will end. You are on the edge of your seat the entire time. Overall, this is my favorite film in the series. I can\u2019t wait to see how Cruise will try to top himself in the next film. ",

Despite that, It has flaws and I feel like I can be sure that it isn't the best film I have ever seen. I still loved this movie. This review is spoiler free. \n\n11/15 points go to the STORY category. This film has a good story where a load of confusion can be stirred up at any moment. There are loads of plot twists that aren't shocking due to a terrible marketing campaign. There are also unclear plans made at certain moments. The basic premise is nothing like I've ever seen though. \n\n10/10 points go to the ACTING category. Tom Cruise, who learned how to fly a helicopter for this movie, is stellar. He is a great actor who definitely does very well in this movie. Henry Cavill, Alec Baldwin, Simon Pegg, ect. also give amazing performances. They all seem very into character. \n\n10/10 points go to the VISUAL EFFECTS category. The film is visually stunning. I enjoy watching the visuals throughout and my eyes weren't hurt. \n\n10/10 points go to the CHARACTERS category. The characters are great. They have their purpose and they serve their purpose. If they need it, they get development. If they don't, they don't get it. It's simple as that. I think that the character who shines out most is Luther. Luther has an emotional moment and it really makes us see the character as more than a sidekick.\n\n4/ 5 points go to the DEVELOPMENT category. The film sees a problem, some twists, some mishaps, and a solution. There is one problem though. There are many characters who don't grow at all and don't get the ability to be seen in a whole new light. The characters do get into a different place than we saw them at first though.\n\n3/ 5 points go to the ORIGINAL SCORE category. The music is really good. Mission Impossible has some of the best music from what I've heard. The problem with this score is that there are parts that go with the movie only. You can't listen to them without the visuals of the film. This is a bit disappointing. \n\n5/5 points go to the DESIGN category. The film has a great costume design which makes the characters come to life. There is also good makeup. The design has nothing super special, but what it has is amazing. I especially love the technology designs.\n\n10/10 points go to the DIRECTION category. The film is directed well by whoever directed it. The fight scenes are well choreographed and everyone is well directed throughout. I think the direction in this movie is probably the most well directed of the year for live-action films.\n\n8/10 points go to the AUDIO AND VISUAL QUALITY category. The film sounds pretty good. There are many points where the movie sounds like just explosions and gunshots. The 3D effects are pretty meh, though what is decent is the fact that it doesn't look too dark in 3D. I'd recommend that you see this film in IMAX, where there are scenes where there is extra image. The music is also well done, and plays at the right moments.\n\n17/20 points go to the OVERALL CONSENSUS category. I thought this film was pretty good. It is at times slow, and the story is at times pretty horribly written. I think that the movie is pretty well made, choreographed, and directed. The thing about this film that stands out is the cinematography and fight scenes.\n\nScore: 88%\nGrade: B+",

From start to finish, Mission: Impossible - Fallout was action packed and had me on the edge of my seat. The cinematography was downright stunning. The skydiving scene, bathroom fight, car chase scene, etc are all AMAZING. In fact, everything about this film is amazing. There are dozens of moments that I was wrestling with myself over whether some shots were special effects or practical effects. The sound design is the best I\u2019ve heard since Blade Runner 2049. Every punch, gunshot, breaking of wall/shelves/tables/chairs, they all sounded so real. It helped emerse me into the movie even more. I only have one problem. I never really understood the motives of the villains. Some people just wanted anarchy, but others just did it... for an unexplained reason. I would have liked to hear a bit more from one character in particular on why he made the decisions he did, but either way he was still a great villain. So to some this review up, this was one of the most badass and crazy action films of this decade. It\u2019s up there with John Wick and Fury Road for sure. Additionally, it\u2019s the best of the Mission: Impossible series and every new installment just keeps getting better. 9.5/10",

            "content": "In \u201cFallout\u201d we see McQuarrie and Cruise team up for a second time in the franchise, and this time they go bigger than any \u201cMission\u201d has yet. Where most blockbusters seek to set the tone of their film by smashing together high-end VFX to get their audience engaged, \u201cFallout\u201d chooses a more brisk, easy-going, and familiar path to calm the audience before the storm. That storm being a heart-pounding thrill ride for 120 continuous minutes with countless twists, turns, and stomach lurches that keeps the audience on the edge of their seat. That may sound unappetizing for those seeking substance underneath the style, but rest assured, McQuarrie takes care of the characters and the story with ease. Many action films today become bogged down in lofty, weightless ambitions that never give action scenes true value in their design. Here, there are moments where you can breathe easy, albeit brief, but those moments only enhance the spectacle. It\u2019s something that few action films have achieved throughout the course of cinema history, but it\u2019s something that McQuarrie has excelled in both times. What\u2019s most rewarding about \u201cFallout\u201d besides the outstanding setpieces and world class technical work, is the character work. Being the sixth film in the franchise, it\u2019s hard to wrap your head around the idea that McQuarrie has found a way to continuously make the characters interesting. Many of the relationships we see have already been founded, established, and built, but there are always complications that blocks Ethan\u2019s path to success. Thus giving the audience newer dimensions to explore with the face of the franchise. That face of the franchise being the \u201cmethod\u201d in \u201cthe method behind the madness\u201d, because \u201cFallout\u2019s\u201d action scenes are monumental. Many films try their hand at a Halo Jump sequence, but none even come close to what is accomplished here. Then, you think you\u2019ve seen it all, and McQuarrie, Cruise, and the rest of the crew go one step and one punch further by channeling their inner Bond to deliver a brutal bathroom brawl. Only to then be one-upped by a sequence in Paris that is choreographed with unparalleled precision that it makes any chase scene you\u2019ve seen prior look like a walk in the park. There\u2019s a slight hyperbole to that statement, but it\u2019s that damn good, and I haven\u2019t even mentioned the helicopter sequence. There is so much happening within \u201cFallout\u201d, but it\u2019s all focused, directed, and choreographed in the most rewarding way imaginable. The action is superb, but without the finely tuned character work they simply do not excel at the degree in which they do. As you\u2019ve read, \u201cMission: Impossible - Fallout\u201d is everything you anticipated it to be, and then some. It was hard to envision a reality in which a film could rival George Miller\u2019s \u201cMad Max: Fury Road\u201d in terms of scale, artistry, precision, and stunt work back when it released in 2015, but \u201cFallout\u201d fights for the top spot. In many ways, you can see that McQuarrie was inspired by \u201cFury Road\u201d in how that film uses diegetic or non-diegetic music to amplify tension. Many boisterous and bombastic tunes are composed by Lorne Balfe, but he always reigns it back in with soft, calming tracks to keep the tension and heart hand in hand. Alongside that we see cinematographers Rob Hardy and Hugues Espinasse tighten their focus on each roar of a motorcycle or whipping of helicopter blades. The camerawork is constantly playing your heart like a drum, and Christopher McQuarrie guides it into the holy land of action films. Throughout the film you can see the utmost respect McQuarrie has to previous staples of the genre by sprinkling in homages to old Jackie Chan films, James Bond films, and works as recent as \u201cThe Raid\u201d. Recognizing that \u201cMission: Impossible\u201d would not be where it is without the grandfathers of the genre. Films like \u201cMission: Impossible - Fallout\u201d are a once in a franchise type of achievement and it, like Cruise, are showing no signs of slowing down. It\u2019s a harmonious action symphony for the record books that is filled to the brim with death-defying stunts, layered character work, and a mountainous celebration of the \u201cMission: Impossible\u201d franchise. Mission accomplished. \u201cMission: Impossible - Fallout\u201d gets a 98/100",

The incredible set pieces are enhanced by the practical effects and Tom Cruise's dedication to doing his own stunts. The action, while being some of the best ever put to film, isn't the only great thing about the film. Fallout also boasts complex and likable characters. Cruise's character, Ethan Hunt, displays cynicism and weariness from his multiple exploits, yet is still always willing to do what he feels is right. He is joined on his mission by his lovable teammates Luther and Benji, played by Ving Rhames and Simon Pegg. Rebecca Ferguson remains the badass we met in Rogue Nation. Henry Cavill has never been better than he is here as Cruise's rival who challenges him on a physical level, while also serving as a foil to the character of Ethan Hunt. The film's story takes all the best aspects of previous installments to create a tension filled experience that keeps the audience holding their breaths until the very exciting end. Christopher McQuarrie's Fallout succeeds in everything it set out to do, it has incredible action, strong acting, sleek direction, and an exciting story. If you want to check out one of the best films of the year, as well as one of the best action films of all time, then go check it out.",

            "content": "Good morning/afternoon/evening, fellow film spectator/movie viewer. Your optional mission, should you choose to accept it, is more of a recommendation that involves riding on the added set pieces of tracks that furthers the ride of a franchise known under \"Mission: Impossible\". If you have ridden through the first five missions, particularly the fifth and essentially the first and third - basically the odd-numbered missions - you should feel that the sixth mission under operation \"Fallout\" had heightened the adrenaline and complexity under the constant push over the last.\n\nHere's the lowdown of what's happening: After a mission gone wrong because of good intentions, the choices comes back to haunt and tests agent Ethan Hunt and the remaining available members of his IMF team. Conflicted with familiar allies while being monitored by the accompanied CIA agent, it becomes a race against time of overcoming obstacles that questions those usual motives to resolve the human error that would really put the world at risk.\n\nDirector Christopher McQuarrie has been steering the franchise's wheel for two missions since the fifth, which is more than those who previously helmed the past missions as mostly one-shots. McQuarrie's constant direction between the two missions has gotten a little heavier when still further pushing, testing and questioning what the filmic missions and tactics stands for, while also involving more personal stuff into the characters. The said push resulted in the aforementioned heightened complexity through thoroughly thought-out intelligence still pulling out twists and turns, as well planning out the action sequences to generate thrills as adrenaline's the main component to the push. The stylistic and subtly dramatic approach also went onto new testing grounds for the action genre.\n\nSingle-handedly grasping the adrenaline, Tom Cruise continues his usual risky take as an action movie star that's astonishingly gripping with tighter and larger space, delivered by taut cinematography in expressing the aura of the individual situation. But when he's not straining his muscles in stunts, he still performs almost at a same level in strength with his known casual charm.\n\nIn addition to Cruise's energy as part of the operation direction's furthering things particularly the emphasis on the inner and outer importance of the characters, the rest of the cast, most of them returned from few previous missions, followed well along that line of minimum expectation that Cruise set. Henry Cavill joins the team by literally punching into the game in attempt to credit the well-choreographed action with equivalent rivalry formation and reflective suspicion as part of a partially predictable twist till the confirmation around the surprising turning point. Returning from the previous mission, Rebecca Ferguson continues the favorable aspect surrounding her character while fulfilling another's half and breaking more of a barrier that improves the franchise's taste in casting.\n\nShould you or any of your party not find the time to experience what's being agreeably hailed as the best mission yet in the practical action franchise that seems to glorified the genre, knowledge of your decided actions will not be disavowed but to your own under the shrunken effect that tightens \"Mission: Impossible - Fallout\" to the acceptable minimum that will still deliver the thrills and intelligence. This review will self-destruct if something occurs in your present device that would make this unavailable. Have fun experiencing the thrill. (A+)",

The locations in this film stood out more than some other locations. I think this film had so many twist. I feel like this film got much better with Alec Baldwin. We got to see Alec Baldwin do different things than we saw him do in Rogue Nation. This was great to see on the big screen. There was so much to see in those wide shots. I don't think that this film was as good as Rogue Nation or Ghost Protocol as far as story. I really enjoy this film and will purchase it and recommend others to see it. I did not like the music as much in this film as in Rogue Nation, Ghost Protocol, Mission Impossible III, or Mission Impossible. I thought this film was interesting how they had so many different sides going after a single goal like the CIA, British Intelligence aka MI6, Mission Impossible Force, Plus the villains. I really liked the the stunts like the helicopter chase or the bathroom. The bathroom stunts were crazy intense. What was unique was how the guy they were fighting was shown as a better fighter than Tom Cruise as Ethan Hunt or Henry Cavil's character . This film did a great job on Henry Cavil as Superman without questioning him as Superman. I think that the mustache and the way the character was written worked in this film. I also liked that this film had a group that was an in between group that was working for the White Widow. That was an interesting twist seeing a group not working for a country but working for an inbetween group. I like how this film dealt with getting the bad guy out. This film was missing the comedy like in Rogue Nation or Ghost Protocol. There was not as much comedy in this film either from dialog lines or physical comedy. So in that sense this film missed it as far as the fun aspect. I thought this film was interesting in how they went about introducing Emma Faust to the story. I liked her entrance in the film. I like how the masks were used in this film. I also enjoyed how the Mission Impossible recording was done in a Iliad and the Odyssey book. I feel like having the girl from the 3rd Mission Impossible film was not done well enough in Fallout as it could have been just because her screen time was so minimal. I will say I enjoyed this film a lot but not as much as Mission Impossible films 3-5. ",

            "content": "An intense action epic brimming with thrills!\n\nChristopher McQuarrie directs an action film that is massive in scope, ambitious in realism, and stunning in execution. Fallout goes to multiple exotic locales, shot beautifully, and with memorable cinematography. The stunt work is immaculate with real stunts executed by Tom Cruise. The HALO jump is breathtaking, the bathroom fight is cool, and the gun-play is visceral. The fight choreography is brutal and feels like the punches have weight.\n\nTom Cruise is the main draw as always. His dedication to performing the stunts for real is admirable, but his dramatic acting as Ethan Hunt is still my favorite part. Cruise is the ultimate action star, but also an accomplished dramatic actor. He runs all over the world, jumps from roof to roof, actually flies a helicopter, jumps from a plane, fights men in hand to hand combat, and shoots firearms constantly in the most exhilarating Mission: Impossible film yet. I may prefer Ghost Protocol more still, but Fallout is a close second for the best Mission: Impossible movie for sure.\n\nThe supporting cast is particularly notable this time around with excellent performances all around. Cruise's Ethan Hunt is offset well by the always  hilarious Simon Pegg as Benji, who finally gets more to do in the franchise. Newcomer, Henry Cavill is intimidating and formidable as August Walker. Cavill holds his own both in combat and drama alike. \n\nSurprisingly, Ving Rhames is not only back, but he also gets to deliver more weighted dramatic dialogue. I really liked his performance here. He carries himself with an earnest concern for Ethan as well as a likable presence as Luther Stickell. Likewise, Alec Baldwin has a brief, but incredibly memorable role reprising his part as Alan Hunley. You'll like him in Fallout. \n\nSimilarly, Rebecca Ferguson kills it again as Ilsa Faust. She is cool, smart, and interesting as Ethan Hunt's foil and love interest. I wish there were even more of Ferguson! She could easily play the lead in the next movie. Next, Michelle Monaghan makes a neat cameo with some serious lines and a touching delivery. I was disappointed that her character goes in the direction they went with, but I understand. Lastly for the ladies, Angela Bassett gets a small, but integral role as the head of the CIA Erica Sloane. I hope she appears in more Mission: Impossible movies!\n\nIn regards to the villains, Sean Harris is frightening and monstrous as Solomon Lane. Harris is even scarier than he was in Rogue Nation. Also, Vanessa Kirby is sultry and intriguing as White Widow. I wonder if they'll bring her back as she has potential for more on screen crime. She is pleasantly good in Fallout. Overall, the entire ensemble is excellently well cast and aptly utilized. \n\nAll in all, you will be entertained by Fallout. I think there is plenty here for any audience. Fast paced action, character progression, enjoyable dialogue, intriguing story, clever fake outs, and funny jokes. Fallout is phenomenal!",

I truly believe this franchise is currently Tom Cruise's best work in his career. His dedication to the stuntwork in these movies is just extraordinary.\u00a0 I liked seeing the characters I've seen in previous entries again and Henry Cavill was a fun addition. The movie is among the best of the summer and even of the year. It's a ton of fun and only left me wanting even more from this franchise and these characters. This movie is a love letter to action movie junkies because every action scene is essentially flawless.\u00a0",

Tom Cruise SHINES again in 20 years of a nonstop action-packed spy franchise as Ethan Hunt! The man does his own stunts, people! He even broke his ankle and kept running. This movie is bloated with action, dialogue, emotions, suspense, amazing performances, stunts, and ACTION! It\u2019s not just the stunts, the acting, McQ\u2019s direction - the action is also choreographed with Rob Hardy\u2019s Cinematography. The Halo jump, the vehicular/motorcycle chase in Paris, the foot chase, and HELICOPTER chase. It\u2019s EVERYWHERE! This movie is very emotional. It\u2019s emotional that it tears you apart just like how it tore me apart in the theater. It\u2019s full of twist and turns (OBVIOUSLY) and \u201cHalloween masks\u201d. It\u2019s been only three years since Mad Max: Fury Road and Fallout OUTDID it! Best Movie of 2018! 9.4/10.",

What pushed me over the edge of giving it 5 stars were definitely the action sequences, so let's talk about those. This movie has one of the most exhilarating and intense action sequences of the past decades. What you should know going into this movie is that Tom Cruise practically did all of his own stunts. The helicopter chase, the jumping over buildings, escaping on a motorcycle on a busy street, everything was Tom Cruise. The story too is phenomenal, Solomon Lane (Sean Harris) returning was a really good part of the continuity between these movies. The situations these characters are brought in and how they react to those situations is truly in there own character and all of it is executed very well. Some of the dialogue was a bit choppy and didn't feel right, talking about Angela Bassett here. But still, this is the perfect action movie and definitely one of the best action movies of the past decade. The soundtrack by Lorne Balfe is also excellent and feels so epic with so much tension for an action movie. The fight scenes and the choreography in them was also amazing, especially the bathroom fight, those punches look and feel real. The cinematography is also very good, Rob Hardy is really making a name for himself. Overall I just really loved this movie, please go see it.",

            "content": "If action is what you want this summer, well congratulations - you're in luck. Since the original TV show and De Palma's first movie, 'Mission: Impossible' has undergone a vast evolution. Whereas the series was more of a thriller before, it has now become an all-out action extravaganza; far more focused on car chases, fist-fights and death-defying stunts than it is on story. This has its ups and downs, with the plot in particular - for the most part a typical twisty-turney, nuclear weapon, end of the world type deal - easy to criticise. Nonetheless, although it's clearly just glue between set-pieces, McQuarrie is a talented enough writer to make it interesting. And as far as action goes, 'Fallout' is leaps and bounds above pretty much every other action franchise around. Even though I don't think it has any sequences on par with the Burj Khalifa scene in 'Ghost Protocol' nor the opera scene in 'Rogue Nation', a white-knuckled bathroom fight, an amazing motorcycle chase and a bevy of other vehicular madness ensures you are left gripping your seat for a good proportion of the runtime.\n\n'Fallout' is undoubtedly a technical masterpiece, and another great addition to the franchise in keeping with the previous two instalments. As far as summer blockbusters go, this is pretty much perfect. I do, however, think the series is coming to a point where - if it wishes to continue - it needs to be reinvented once again. For the first time in quite a while I felt like the formula was starting to show, just a little. They changed it up in 'Ghost Protocol', let's hope they can do it again.",

This is by far the best Mission Impossible film by a long shot. It really is amazing that the sixth film in the franchise is better than its predecessors combined and if this standard maintains then it\u2019s a franchise that certainly isn\u2019t going away any time soon. Mission: Impossible \u2013 Fallout is not only as good as you\u2019ve heard, it\u2019s better.Everyone\u2019s back, director Christopher McQuarrie, Tom Cruise, Ving Rhames, Simon Pegg and Rebecca Ferguson. Also featuring some new additions, Angela Bassett, Henry Cavill and the infamous moustache that ruined Justice League. The story is simple enough, stop terrorists getting nuclear weapons at all costs. But the story isn\u2019t where it\u2019s at, it\u2019s not about the gadgets or even the ridiculous masks that I can\u2019t seem to get over. No it\u2019s all about the action and the stunts and wow does it deliver. Once the action starts it just keeps on coming, an intense thrill from start to finish. The action sequences are spectacular. If there\u2019s one thing you can count on is the stunts get better every time. Not only are they well coordinated they\u2019re clear to watch. You\u2019re never sitting there wondering who\u2019s hitting who, the nausea inducing shaky cam sending you over the edge (Yeah I\u2019m looking at you Bourne 5) or watching a car chase in a comical stream of quickly edited shots leaving you not knowing what the hell is going on (hang your head in shame Quantum of Solace). Mission: Impossible \u2013 Fallout is action filmmaking done to perfection with an electrifying film score by Lorne Balfe that compliments every scene, I loved it.Some of you may know I\u2019m not exactly the biggest Tom Cruise fan and that\u2019s putting it mildly but damn he\u2019s one hell of a stunt man. It\u2019s not just the running, and the running. He\u2019s doing everything from hanging on to the side of a helicopter to shattering his ankle while jumping from one building to another. The stunts and the film itself have exceeded expectations so believe me when I say under no circumstance should you miss this movie. Highly recommended and you know if I\u2019m recommending a Tom Cruise movie then it has to be worth it.",

The failed stunt resulted in fractured ankles and 8 weeks of delayed production. The buildup, publicity and the motivation behind this stunt is a perfect analogy for Mission Impossible: Fallout. The minds behind this film set out to create a eye-catching, edge of your seat spectacle and succeed despite several near misses.The premise here is that Cruise\u2019s Ethan Hunt and his Impossible Mission Force team of spies botch a nuclear arms deal and are tasked with retrieving the goods by any means necessary while under the watchful eye of the CIA with a thuggish Henry Cavill acting as babysitter long for the ride on the IMFs exploits. Along the way, the audience is treated to a series of amazing action set pieces including a death-defying skydiving sequence, shootouts, chase-sequences, and the aforementioned leap of faith. Along the way, Simon Pegg does an excellent job of providing the levity and the excellently relentless Rebecca Ferguson acts as foil to Cruise\u2019s Hunt. If the casting sounds familiar, it should since many characters and plot points carry over from McQuarrie and Cruise\u2019s previous collaboration (Rogue Nation), and it is ultimately to the film\u2019s benefit as the casts dynamics work well and helps to flesh out this universe that the filmmaker seems to be building. There are laughs; there are thrills; but most importantly, there is motivation for all of these people to be on screen together which doesn\u2019t feel forced or unnatural. However, despite everything this movie does well, there are a few hiccups along the way.To be fair, at a runtime of 2 hours 28 minutes, the movie does not drag or punish you for sitting through it.  The filmmaker at work here does a good job of pacing the action to allow the audience time to breathe and soak in the splendor before jumping into another intense scene.  In addition, the exposition (and there is a lot of it) feels natural as spies need to be briefed and debriefed on missions and does not give the audience many reasons to doze off during scenes that don\u2019t contain running or shooting.  What does happen though is a case of over extension.  Fallout contains what seems like a natural, traditional first, second and third act; yet it decides to cram in a fourth act for the heck of it at the 2 hour mark.  It\u2019s almost as if McQuarrie and Cruise wanted to begin the sequel to the film before the credits rolled.  And this is what\u2019s unfair to viewers: subjecting them to the overindulgence of the filmmaker rather than giving them a movie going experience they are not soon to forget for the RIGHT reasons.  Besides this, the movie also seems to waste great actors at the expense of Cruise\u2019s screen time. Simon Pegg, Angela Bassett and Alec Baldwin all essentially provide cameos when their characters seem to warrant more.  And most egregiously, Henry Cavill\u2019s brash, roguish super spy (a role he seems born to play) is unfairly pushed aside on several occasions.Despite a few missteps, and a challenging runtime, Fallout provides a spectacle that few other movies are able to accomplish these days. It awes, provides laughs, and constantly reminds its audience why some movies just have to be seen on the big screen. Similar to the aforementioned stunt mishap, Fallout has every intention of impressing its audience with the sheer size, danger and gall it takes to constantly raise the stakes in a genre that relies on tropes and familiar plots. But as the real-life story showed us, no matter how meticulous the planning that goes into such a risk, it does not guarantee a perfect shot. 3 out of 5 Stars",

Ethan Hunt (Tom Cruise) heads to Berlin to intercept three plutonium cores before the Apostles get there and sell them to John Lark. However, things turn around for the worst as Luther (Ving Rhames) is taken hostage, and Hunt chooses to save Luther's life leading the plutonium to be taken. Ethan is then sent to Paris, where he is joined alongside agent August Walker (Henry Cavill), where they try to take back the plutonium. When things still don't go according to plan, as they cannot find the right enemy, they're given more tasks to try and track down the culprit.

The action fills the movie with a sense of gravitas and you can feel every sense of danger, not just for the characters, but for the actors too.

While it is commendable that the action scenes are done largely practical, what trulySix movies in and the Mission: Impossible train continues to hit big with yet another high octane thrill ride that is entertaining and highly re-watchable. While it is commendable that the action scenes are done largely practical, what truly does make them work is the understanding the directors have with knowing how to make great action scenes. The set pieces are fun, the choreography is great, and you are not questioning how any of this could happen in real life. They just do! It's a secret rhythm of tension and escapism that truly make this franchise one of the greats! However the thing that truly sets this movie back from being as amazing as the hype makes it out to be, at least for me, is the script. Now I am well aware that in terms of storytelling, the Mission: Impossible films are not all that great, and I am okay with that because I never felt like the previous films tried to be something that it's not, nor do the scripts detract from the overall enjoyment (the exception to that rule being the second film, obviously). However, the writing for this movie really does hamper a lot of the fun. For one, the dialogue can be really bad at times and often comes off as cheesy without any self-awareness for how cornball they truly are. Not to mention how many times the movie tries to be clever with it's multiple plot twists that just gets more obnoxious as the film goes on. Especially when it comes with the big reveal of who this mole agent is, which is so painfully obvious the movie never tried to hide it. There is even a scene which blatantly shows its cards to the audience. I won't spoil it but if you have seen it, you know what I am talking about. The acting is a bit hit or miss as well. While there are not truly amazing performances in this movie, for the most part the actors do a good job and are totally invested, with Tom Cruse, Simon Pegg, Ving Rhames, Rebecca Ferguson, and Sean Harris doing solid work. However, the weakest link of the main cast is Henry Cavil. I do not mind him as an actor as so many people do that I know of, however here he is quite terrible. So much of his delivery is wooden and stiff, he does not look like he is having any fun at all with his role, and his accent is phony at best, as he sounds like he is doing an impression of Spottswoode from Team America. His mustache is pretty good, I must say. Angela Bassett and, surprisingly, Alec Baldwin are also pretty bad here too.Fallout is certainly overrated in parts, but it is still another great film in the franchise. Should they stop making them while they are ahead? Yeah probably. But regardless, I am still looking forward to where the series comes to next!",

When Fallout released I had only seen up to III, so I watched Ghost Protocol and Rogue Nation in the days up to going to see Fallout. Ghost Protocol in particular is an excellent film, and Fallout is easily the best in the series to date. It's intense, well-paced, has a few quiet but very powerful moments, and has a well-rounded cast. The addition of Henry Cavill is an interesting one, especially considering what they do with his character. It benefits greatly from involving many returning characters, especially the villain and new female lead from Rogue Nation. The action scenes do not disappoint: brutal fistfights, car and motorcycle chases, and a climactic helicopter duel that had my moviegoing companion literally on the edge of their seat. I don't get to go out to many movies aside from Marvel ones and the occasional Disney movie. Fallout was a great summer blockbuster and well worth seeing in theaters.",

This Review will mostly consist of bias towards how IMAX is the best place to watch movies. BIAS! Because when you're at stakes,he has your back.And that will already tell you how Mission Impossible Fallout,the sixth (yes. SIXTH) entry of a franchise consistent of movies upgraded after the previous one,takes all the other Summer Movies (except Incredibles 2) and throws them at the Garbage Bin like nothing ever happened.Oh,and also it's the closest thing to the best of the franchise and,whatever\u2026But going down to the point,yes. Of course it rocks. Maybe more than I expected.And hey,for a movie that made me jump off my seat,scream two times (I was at the IMAX showing,so the loudness made it for everything) and having the best use 3D since Avatar,it really did its job.Here we have a movie that may enter into the Staples of action movies that has an ingenious use of plot twists (with one that made me laugh,being in my mind \u201cso that is what Jurassic World 2 tried to do!\u201d), exhilarating and tension-filled action sequences (full of great usage of IMAX Cameras more than their previous effort) and a screenplay that feels like a school lesson that you need to listen carefully because it's gonna make it for the exams the next day.The story manages to give away a few nods and connections to previous MI Movies (especially Rogue Nation) which was really enjoyable to see as a fan of this franchise.Speaking of the story,it also manages to get intense sometimes,with one death sequence that was so creepy,it reminded me of how TJ Miller\u2019s character died in Transformers 4. (Ugh). Not only that,but the way it starts to build up the tension in several scenes only to find out that \u201cWait! It was all a set-up for something\u201d.And trust me when I say Vanessa Kirby\u2019s presence as a secondary character was better than the 5 minutes of Jeff Goldblum in Jurassic Stink 2. Oh,and thank God they gave Solomon Lane more stuff to do as a villain. He was threatening in Rogue Nation,believe me,but I kind of forgot his motivation in that movie\u2026The Action Sequences are Adrenaline Fuel. The intense kind of Adrenaline Fuel,and that's where my IMAX Bias starts,so get ready. *Sings like the Animaniacs showing every nation*: Jumping the seats during every gunshot,looking away during the HALO Jump - covering my eyes while Tom Cruise hits a damn Helicopter! - The Paris motorcycle sequence almost peed my pants - And during the helicopter Sequences I screamed at the theater two times! *Stops singing*Seriously,though. When did you scream at an Action Movie (on an IMAX Theater) that has a thrilling Helicopter scene last time? Oh,and SEE IT IN IMAX 3D,DAMMIT!As much as everyone calls it a \u201cGimmick\u201d these days,it helped out for a lot of Action going on,like during the HALO Jump,where Cruise almost jumped out of the screen,or the Helicopter Sequence.To continue the gold nuggets,Lorne Balfe (Composer of Pacific Rim Uprising and LEGO Batman) has finally made his signature score,with a reliance on 'The Plot Thickens\u2019,yeah (just like Joe Kraemer last time),but he somehow manages to put new life into the theme,while accompanying it with a slew of exciting cues (and a Zimmer-esque theme that hearing on an IMAX felt like me being treated with infinite plates of 24-Carat Gold...Mmmm...Gold\u2026).And\u2026.Wait. No CG? All Practical? Are you sure? That death sequence felt CG\u2026 Well what's the point nontheless,it was all great,so\u2026And of course,aside the acting doing a great job,I could see a Tom Cruise in there determined and motivated to do all of this shenanigans that could've killed him in no time (*coff coff* The Ankle *coff coff*).Oh,wow\u2026You know? For a movie like Mission Impossible Fallout,I didn't think of coming out of the theater like this,realized with multiple emotions at once. Usually,when I see a movie,I stay there like a normal person,but...WOW,this movie unlocked my emotions in no time,so I commend it for that too.A year ago,when Dunkirk had come out,I saw it in IMAX (of course) I felt the tension,and I grabbed myself for a couple of minutes, but I never thought a dumb fun Action Movie like Mission freaking Impossible would make me emotionally alive. Hell,Infinity War didn't do nothing for me on first viewing,aside the full \u201cImmersion\u201d.So yeah,Mission Impossible Fallout is the best movie of the bunch that with Christopher McQuarrie's intelligent direction,a coherent story and action sequences that make you feel like an idiot if you didn't see them on IMAX,manages to also be the best movie of the Summer,if not of 2018 so far.Oh,and SEE IT IN IMAX 3D.End of the IMAX Bias.

The MI franchise has a remarkable talent for improving itself. There is one scene where you can automatically predict how it'll turn out. However, everything was so well edited I was tricked into feeling tense anyway.Director Christopher McQuarrie has an excellently deliberate sense of shots and pacing with both the suspense and fight scenes. The action scenes equally don't disappoint.For a nice change of pace, the movie focuses a little more on Ethan Hunt's mindset. He finds himself going undercover with dangerous people. There's a fair amount of tension and pathos to be mined from his facing the difficulty of trying to be a good man and completing his mission in a flawed, murky world.Now I wouldn't consider these deal-breakers, but there are a couple nitpicks. The film is a bit long. Some of the action scenes do go on and on. Also, it wouldn't have hurt if the plot was a bit more streamlined. The middle does feel a little sidequestey.",

MISSION: IMPOSSIBLE - FALLOUT finds Ethan Hunt (Tom Cruise) and his IMF team (Alec Baldwin, Simon Pegg, Ving Rhames) along with some familiar allies (Rebecca Ferguson, Michelle Monaghan) in a race against time after a mission gone wrong. Henry Cavill, Angela Bassett, and Vanessa Kirby also join the dynamic cast with filmmaker Christopher McQuarrie returning to the helm.I really loved Mission: Impossible - Fallout, I missed these breathtaking action scenes this year, but finally, I found what I've been looking for for very so long, and thanks goes to Mission: Impossible - Fallout.Everything in this movie was completely amazing, except for a small leak.. and it is the script... As I said it's not big, it's just a bothering sentence is repeating every plan..Let's get started with the only thing I didn't like about this movie, and as I said it's the script. Okay, why every thing they are about to do, or planned to do, or anything to do, they just have to say \"I'll figure it out\" or \"I'm working on it\"? What? Didn't you plan for anything for this movie or something?These two sentences bothered the hell out of me, actually! But it's nothing compared to everything that I loved in this movie.First of all, the action sequence, it's one of the best action movie of all the time! Every action scene I was like \"OMG, thank you for giving me a masterpiece in action, thank you!\". I think it's the best action movie in 2018 so far.Quickly quickly.. let's move to the performances... I loved them all! What an act-convincing?! I have no other comment about the acting, cause it was quite perfect!Oh, we're not done yet, we still have the fascinating storytelling! I don't want to spoil anything, but I need to say that don't believe what you're watching, cause they will surprise you like hell!!!!The story was good in every way that it could be, maybe at the beginning it didn't get my attention, but then it got my whole attention!Believe me, no one is overreacting when he says that this movie is a masterpiece, and if you don't believe us, go and see it yourself. It will not let you down, never ever!I actually wasn't excited to watch this movie, the trailer didn't get me at all, but it did actually give me what I want, it was way better than I expected it's gonna be!Oh, one more sadly thing I just remembered that I didn't like, the OST wasn't that good as it was so usual. But it wasn't so bad!I'm gonna give Mission: Impossible - Fallout an A, I think it's a magnificent movie, and definitely a worth-watching movie, I highly recommend watching this movie, guys.Okay, guys, thank you as always for reading my review, hope you like, and if you have any comment, please, say it to get improved.",

Easily the best action film of the summer and possibly the best since \"The Matrix\"As I have said before, Tom Cruise films are generally well-oiled machines. But this machine is a high-end sports car: thrilling and the handling is precise. Easily the best action film of the summer and possibly the best since \"The Matrix\" upped the action genre back in 1999.The action is relentless to the point where you say: \"this all seems a little unneccessary\". The trailers leading up to the July release have betrayed a fair amount of plot IMHO. But like a great omelette, it's not the individual ingredients but how they are ultimately cooked together that make it delicious.Not sure how much of this iteration of Ethan Hunt is Cruise or McQuarrie. The audience who have loyally followed this character over SIX editions of this franchise have likely seen the actor in his various other roles and films over that span. As youthful as he looks, Cruise seems to be letting the audience in on the fact that he is 56, heading for 60. The terrific bathroom fight scene with Cavill and Yang actually shows a man who has done probably thousands of takes of fight scenes, and frankly looks winded and flagging. There is a preceptible pattern of vulnerability emerging over the last few films, and it's actually pretty satisfying. It enriches his characters and doesn't lessen them.McQuarrie has emerged as a profoundly good action director. \"Rogue Nation\" was solid but it was really \"Jack Reacher\" where we got to see a director take somewhat thin material and elevate it to a much higher level.Finally, there is a curious retrospective quality to \"Fallout\" that seems to play on many of Cruise's earlier films. The end of the bathroom scene reminded me of \"Jerry Maguire\", busting into the funeral service with spinning disorientation echoed \"Eyes Wide Shut\", and the bare hand rock climb in the climactic confrontation reminded me of the opening sequence of \"MI:2\". Enigmatic in real life, there is no mistaking that this dude is an anomaly in the corporate Disneyland that is modern Hollywood: a classic movie star.",

By their own efforts, force-sensitive scavenging Jedis; vengeful ladies with psychokinetic skills and enhanced mental abilities or lethal combat prowess from ancient Chinese martial arts; drivers with good values ready for any racing madness involving high speed; young people experiencing memory or hearing problems thirsty for the adrenaline of a car, a motorbike, a yacht or a punch; supermen, superwomen, villains and anti-heroes who fight for stability defending their beliefs about peace, hope, justice, \"law\" and chaos staunchly; top-secret agents/spies wearing elegant attire that, most of the time, emerge victorious from their missions;  retired assassins who forcibly return to 'the Continental Hotel' by a puppy incident and characters and/or animated heroes who save continents, countries, cities, friends and families deserve their due respect and recognition both in the industry and in the history of film. However, suddenly, the sassy boldness and unstoppable charm of the IMF agent who leads, legally or illegally, impossible agency missions have helped to shape one of the best action/adventure films of the 21st century and, sans nul doute, the best actioner since George Miller's 2015 multi-Oscar-winning post-apocalyptic masterpiece. Hence, critics, cinephiles and moviegoers alike are greeting it with raves, comparing the latest and most barbaric adventure of Hunt and his team \u2014 save William Brandt played by Jeremy Renner, who was committed heart and soul to Marvel Studios \u2014 to modern-classic \"Mad Max: Fury Road\" for its mastery assembling and disassembling heart-stopping sequences and to the Christopher Nolan DC trilogy, especially with Warner's 2008 classic \"The Dark Knight,\" for its courage to deal with sore, meaningful purposes with a firm hand and mind-blowing ideas, piling layer after layer on the characters and the plot.An A-1 mainstream film must represent each feature of the script to the screen in the best way possible, however, an A-1 mainstream actioner must articulate smoothly the above with, of course, emblematic sequences. Every new movie in the 22-year franchise provides substantial added value coming in the form of legendary Tom Cruise, a true super-man who categorically rejects the use of stunt performers for his high-risk scenes. Modesty apart, Cruise is an actor who, literally and figuratively, gets under Ethan Hunt's skin, he's Hunt, thus becoming one of the few stars who perform their own action scenes today in Hollywood. This time, forget scratches and bruises, an on-set ankle injury has called him, an accident that halted the movie's shooting until his health improved. Drawing upon some landscapes and townscapes of India, UK, France and New Zealand, Rob Hardy, a modern cinematography maestro who has built artistic sci-fi gems such as \"Annihilation\" and \"Ex Machina,\" places his exquisite style in a setting far from fantasy, getting artfully neat visuals on its objectives with high levels of elegance, sobriety and magnetism on costume and production design, in the old-fashioned Parisian streets or the crushing European dreamscapes. Commitment by each and every one of the members of the huge technical and artistic team is awe-inspiring, they esteem a big budget, and, moreover, prioritize film's artistic purpose over the ever-lurking avidity for extravagant grosses.There are few cases where a commercial advertisement transcends beyond its purpose, here one of the best examples. The creators of the trailer released during Super Bowl LII must not only headline the year-end best trailers lists by critics and movie reviewers, but receive a true award for their exceptional, exceptional work. Although few talk about this kind of stuff in their reviews, the perfectly matched 2-minute stunner made by highly skilled trailer makers deserves it; one of the best trailers of this decade.\"Mission: Impossible-Fallout\" by Christopher McQuarrie smashes, on several occasions and ways, big-budget action movie tropes much like contemporary classics do, moving away from the artificiality of danger to get fully into building a true-blue adrenaline rush. In these times, making high-quality action films in Hollywood has become an impossible feat, putting the blame on plotting emptiness and tech breakthroughs that bury a good narrative. However, with an overlong period of time in between, mainstream gems serendipitily flourishes trying to propose through risks. That is what makes this \"MI\" entry to take part in the select, coveted must-see top of the last eighteen years. Film doesn't falsify reality, imitates it, for this reason, those breathtaking set-pieces are an out-of-this-world experience, where suspense and enjoyment are involuntary reactions to a cinematic cocktail everyone should see. A spectacular, unforgettable roller-coaster ride that vitalizes a billion-dolar spy franchise, a triumph that must be experienced in the largest IMAX screen.",

But i\u2019m here to tell you this movie does not. I\u2019m amazed how after 6 movies, this franchise still manages to make unique movies like this.Going to start talking about the action scenes. Completely amazing, purposefully, well thought out and well choreographed action sequences. This is what Fallout gives us, there was a scene, where Ethan Hunt (Tom Cruise) and Walker (Henri Cavill) are fighting someone in a bathroom. The punches feel so real, the sequences was awesome, and brutal. The cinematography was amazing, more than what i was expecting from a Mission: Impossible movie. And that is because they use practical effects instead of CGI or green screen. That makes the experience as real as possible.Performances, were great from everyone. Not only Tom Cruise, with amazing acting and stunts, but the supporting cast did a great job. Simon Pegg and Ving Rhames were incredible as always, Rabecca Ferguson also did a great job. And this has to be Henry Cavill\u2019s best performance. He was great in the action scenes and his character felt intimidating like it should be.Talking about the story is where i have my first minor issue with this movie. It seems a bit recycled, and to make it completely original after 6 movies, is a bit of a stretch. The big twist is a bit obvious, you can really see it coming. But this doesn\u2019t make the story less mesmerizing, the script was great and the director did a great work into moving the story along in such a way that every scene, every shot and every line of dialogue is extremely important, because it really is.The characters are great too. Ethan Hunt is incredibly charming, and the length he goes to not kill innocent people just makes him more of a compelling character. The villains where great, although i did want to see more from the main villain, as a character.This movie is gonna be in a lot of peoples top lists for 2018, i\u2019m 100% sure it\u2019s gonna be on my top movie list for 2018, and you don\u2019t really want to miss, what i can safely say, is one of the best action movies i\u2019ve ever watched.",

After a mission goes wrong, Ethan and his team needs to work against the clock and fight their way to the objective. Directed by Christopher McQuarrie.Mission: Impossible-Fallout is the longer movie in the franchise, i didn't felt that the story was that good, it still seems to be just an excuse for the action scenes to happen, but i gotta say that the story was at least very functional, it did had some nice twists. There is some coincidences and some motivations that aren't very clear, somethings really didn't make much sense. But generally, the narrative was very entertaining. The movie have different moments, it does have some emotional moments, and some solutions from old stories.Tom Cruise in this movie is one more time awesome, the big thing in his work is that he trully likes what he is doing, it challenges him, and that is totally noticiable and makes a completely difference for the audience, for me, personally, it makes way more easier to board in that journey with him, and his acting was on point as well. Rebecca Ferguson in this one had a little less time than in the last one, but still she is great, she indeed killed in this one, she is mysterious and badass, in this one she also had a little more sentimental part, and for me she sold it very well, so as the action scenes one more time that she was perfect. Henry Cavill do a good job, his physicality helped him a lot for this role, the action moments that he use his strenght worked out very well, in the acting he was also very functional, his character is kind of a not very expressive one, but he had a nice tone. Vanessa Kirby is also in this movie and she convinced me in what she did, she doesn't had much screen, but she was that obstinate and confident character, i bought it. Sean Harris does the same thing that he did in the last one, not very developed, but still, he did very well. Michelle Monaghan is back at the franchise, and she was affectionate, and i believed that she was the same character, was very good. Simon Pegg and Ving Rhames are both good, they are a comic relief and also very importants for the plot to go on. Alec Baldwin don't have much time, but he was good, mainly in the twist moment, he had a nice tone.The action scenes are once again outstanding, sincerely i can't think in much other movies that have better action moments than this one. This movie do some stuff that are really glorifying, so as the last ones also did, wich is mainly not use stunt doubles, not use cgi, no green scree, with everything being real it makes a completely diference, it let us feel better the environment, help us to be in the place. The directing in the action are great, the camera work very well, always following the actors during the scenes, the movie have a lot of giant moments, i have seen behind the scenes of all of them, becaus at first i wasn't believing that he really did all of that, and i was shocked, because some parts that i was sure that wasn't real, it was. Since the moment that they are in the plane in Paris it was great, the mise-en-sc\u00e8ne let me be really comfortable there, and when they jumped, damn, that was fabulous, not just the filming that was genius, but the job that the actors did in the air was great, it was convincing and the sequence had some tension and sense of urgency because of the time. The previous movie had one of, if not, the best motorcycle sequences in movies history, in this one they pretty much reached the same level if not overcame that, the sequence in London here are insane, not just breathtaking but beautiful to watch as well, here the cameras also had a great job, following the characters in a way that is different, isn't like just walking side by side, but when the character fall, the camera have a dash, it was fantastic, the pursuing around the cars, that was just so great. The third insane action sequence, was in the helicopter, that Tom Cruise actually learned to fly a helicopter just for it to look more real here and also did all of the part around the helicopter he really did it, when i say that the actor is so badass as the character, i mean it, and the whole sequence there have a great footage, it is really well filmed, and also breathtaking, can make you sweat during it, the action here is just outstanding.The cinematography is very good, not just for the camera moviment and positioning that i already mentioned, but the colors are very pretty and alive, the movie takes place in different places and environments and it allows they to do a diversity that are so great as the second one, in this one have a snow parts that were really beautiful, not just that, but they use the place very well.",

Along the way, Ethan's true identity is brought into doubt and trust between the government factions involved fractures. The story of this film is by far the weakest part to me. And I don't say this because I think the story was bad, but because this story isn't anything we haven't seen in a Mission Impossible film before. Nuclear devices in play? U.S. Government treating Ethan as a potential hostile? This franchise has never done that before! It moves along in a way that doesn't make it seem repetitive to the point where it took me out of the film, but I just find it funny how the Mission Impossible franchise is able to recycle its storylines without really any backlash. I assume that is primarily because of the action, which I will get into in a second. Anyway, the story is serviceable and despite it getting a little trigger happy with the whole \"No, I betrayed you! No, I betrayed you before you betrayed me!\" concept I enjoyed it. Action: This is what I believe has helped this film rise above previous entries in the franchise and action films in general. The action sequences in this film are superb. The bathroom fight teased in the trailer? It lived up to the hype, as did pretty much every other fight in the film. There are also a few chase sequences that are better than the Bourne films, and that's saying something. In terms of a pure action film, this is one of the best I've seen in a long time. Acting/Characters: Everyone brings their A Game here. There is no weak link here. Tom Cruise once again proves that he apparently doesn't age and will probably play Ethan Hunt until he's 70, and Henry Cavill plays the CIA Agent who doesn't really trust Ethan very well. Screenplay: I don't think that there's any surprise here that Christopher McQuarrie (The Usual Suspects, Edge of Tomorrow, Rogue Nation) wrote a terrific script for this film. One weakness that often stands out with action films is weak dialogue, but not here. It's quite good all around. Cinematography: Camera work in this film was spot on, especially in the fast-moving action scenes. It didn't feel choppy and flowed like water down a stream. Overall: Given a deeper story, Fallout may have ended up one of my favorite if not my favorite film of the year so far.",

That being said, Tom Cruise looked fit as ever in the sixth installment, and proves once again that age is just a number. Sean Harris again plays the best villain the series has seen since Philip Seymour Hoffman, and to top it all of the willingness of Henry Cavill to play a roll in the shadow of one of action-movies-all-time-greats makes the film to what it is. For me personally, the presence of Alec Baldwin (delivering probably the best motivational speech in MI history) was a cherry on top, but that might just be personal. All in all an amazing cast, where Vanessa Kirby steals the show everytime she enters the frame. The film keeps you engaged every step of the way, and makes sure you go home with a rush that only cools down after a couple of hours.

YES. Is it because of its story? No. Yes, Fallout has the one of the weaker stories in the franchise with predictable moments and similar story elements recycled from previous entries. But who goes to see a Mission: Impossible movie for its story? So besides the weaker story, let's dive head-first into what makes this movie exceptional. The action is the best it's ever been, with most of it being practical and on camera. The stunts of this movie will leave you exhausted and gasping for air. The last twenty minutes in particular are the most nail-biting out of the entire movie and franchise. EVERYONE gives a strong performance; with Henry Cavill being the biggest standout of the entire movie. He proves that he is more than just Superman or a pretty face; he's a great actor and proves that mustache-gate will only be a tiny blip in his career. Ving is great, Pegg is great, Ferguson is great, Bassett is great, Baldwin is great, Sean Harris is great, and Tom Cruise is... well, Tom Cruise. The Directing and writing from Christopher McQuarrie is tight and exceptional, same with the cinematography by Rob Hardy. In all, Fallout is the best one in the series simply by its strong cast, tight writing, perfect action, and direction by McQuarrie. If this is where the franchise ends, then it has ended on the highest of high notes and I am grateful for seeing it. I shall watch it, then watch it again, if not for the entertainment, then to learn from the people here, as they clearly know what they're doing.",
