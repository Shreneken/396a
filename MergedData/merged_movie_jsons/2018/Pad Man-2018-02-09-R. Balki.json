            "review_title": "Long Review: Padman",
            "content": "There's a montage sometime in the first hour where the central character approaches women from different walks of life but finds it difficult to convince even one of them to try out his indigenous product. Reason? The touchy subject. Padman aspires to break this stigma associated with the subject of menstrual hygiene. From a delivery point of view, it is roaring succes.Akshay Kumar plays Lakshmi, a simple, uneducated man living with his mother, two sisters, and newly-wedded wife, Gayatri. A bit of an oddball in his thought processes, he makes it his life goal to produce low-cost sanitary napkins when he learns about the hard-up conditions that Gayatri and the women around him including his sisters, who have recently hit puberty live in, when it comes to menstruation. The religious aspect of the issue - where menstruating women are supposed to isolate themselves and live outside the house during the cycle (mostly in rural India) because they are considered impure - also bothers him, which is why Padman looks like it has been written with a complete contemplation of the issue. And, for a person, who has been exposed to high-octane, mindless Bollywood potboilers, this can come as a surprise.Padman, therefore, is a critique of our times when a technically developed country like India that aspires to be digital-ready struggles with something as crucial and necessary as menstrual sanitation. Lakshmi's attempts to educate the people around him and fight the stigma that is stuck like the plague is much more important than to invent a low-cost napkin that is both efficient and cheap. Despite being a little bit successful in the latter department, Lakshmi continuously struggles to remove the preconceptions about menstruation that people have and which they are not ready to talk about. This hesitance to converse about an issue that is tied to a woman's innate health is alarming, and Padman tries to preach about that. Of course, it's a preach, but a social film cannot do without it if it intends to send the point across. Considering that director R Balki is targeting rural India with this film, I am personally content and confident that it will tick.It is because of not just the construction of the sanitary pad but also the construction of the screenplay that this works. Padman excels in all departments, also giving intermediate knowledge about napkins if people don't know about it already. A well-written plot that reminds us of Shree Narayan Singh's 2017 hit drama on a similar social issue, 'Toilet - Ek Prem Katha', also starring Kumar, it moves ahead without hitting a bump. Of course, there are sequences that are sometimes cringe-worthy and sometimes impossible, but director Balki has evidently taken a lot of cinematic liberty, which is mandatory for a film that captures the entire essence of a social predicament such as this. The fact that Padman is based on the real-life story of the Indian inventor, Arunachalam Muruganantham, would make the viewer more confident and supportive of the structure. It's well-written, has good amounts of humour and drama, if not melodrama, and hits the right notes with its messages. With a score that supports the inspirational message, Padman must be viewed on the big screen and be marketed through word of mouth as it demands greater viewership.Akshay Kumar is phenomenal and looks like he came directly out of the aforementioned film's sets. He carries the whole film on his shoulders and never once shows an inkling of restfulness. If there is a character that I feel an actor has done complete justice to in any film in the past few months, it'd be that of Lakshmi. Equally enchanting is the supremely talented Radhika Apte's performance who seems to be made just for the role of the village wife, something that we previously saw her do in Kabali (2016), and Parched (2015) and Manjhi: The Mountain Man (2015) before that. There's not a single dull moment in Padman, thanks to the performances of the lad and the supporting cast. Sonam Kapoor and Amitabh Bachchan grace the screen for some time and do a decent job, but it is the supporting actors that make the whole broth tastier. Similar to how we last saw in R S Prasanna's Shubh Mangal Savdhan (2017), another highlight of Padman is in its dialogues and general writing. Talking about a touchy subject like menstruation is already an exercise, but to make an entire feature film about it, without hitting the awkward and/or obscene point even once, is something of a marvel. Director-writer Balki and co-writer Swanand Kirkire need to be appreciated for the sensitivity that is visible throughout the film, which could have been turned into a vulgar mess had it been executed by some of the more energetic yesteryear Bollywood filmmakers. Padman excels for a lot of reasons, but tailoring it for a conservative audience is one of the major ones.Padman is refreshing because it serves several things on a single plate and yet manages to not overload it. Lakshmi's relentless attitude towards innovation makes this film much more than something about a social cause. Although India is known as the innovators' world, we hardly see such immaculate representation of the same on the silver screen. I don't care much more for the promotional angle of this film, courtesy the current ruling government in India, but as something that is important to mankind, Padman does deserve applause for its pure concoction and filmmaking brilliance. There couldn't be a better time to release this film that even has shades of chivalry (which, spare me the rolling eye, is no longer dead), feminism, and women empowerment. Lakshmi's dream must have taken him to a lot of places, but his underlying thought to not commercialize his invention and instead work for the greater good is something that makes Padman much more effective and deserving of attention.There's a good chance that if one can relate to the subject, tears are going to make a guest appearance at least once in the 140-minute running time. But, even if that does not happen, it will touch your heart through its warm characterization, entrepreneurship, and the sheer ability to pump your beat up. Padman is perhaps R Balki's best film so far, something that I would even go as far as to list in Kumar's filmography as well. TN.",

            "content": "Even before I start analysing 'PadMan' as a movie, I assume films like these have to be lauded simply because they're being made. That actors and filmmakers are using cinema as a tool to strike conversations, tickle thoughts and lift debates, itself is a alleviation; especially in a country of over one hundred crores with numerous problems, most of them neither spoken nor understood.PadMan' is purely a sworn statement of a man's adventure from not anything to contentment; totally banking upon on his very own desires of bringing about fantastic modifications and supporting them sustain. if you ignore a few exaggerations (and i worry I don't have takers for pronouncing this), it is an inspiring film and will create advantageous affects. Decently shot by p.c. Sreeram and rightly complemented with soundtracks composed by Amit Trivedi, it features great performances from each Radhika Apte and Akshay Kumar; and not to forget about, a fluent Sonam Kapoor in a brief yet pivotal role.Watch 'PadMan' to encourage greater movies that communicate about actual troubles; more real than fairytale love stories. Even the real love stories are examined with terrible times, remember? Like that of Lakshmikant and Gayatri.",

            "content": "PADMAN, the movie full of motivation, is about India's one of the real Superhero. Necessity is the mother of innovation is said somewhere, here it is implemented. Padman is a movie which has romance, comedy, serious as well as heart touching moments distributed equally. This is a brave topic to come up with so hats off to Twinkle Khanna, R Balki and the entire team. Special hats off to Mr. Arunachalam Murugnatham for his extraordinary contribution to the society.The film has many moments which make us laugh naturally and its not forced humor. Chemistry between Akshay Kumar and Radhika Apte is also good. The problem of unhygienic sanitation habit is shown in a bold way and its seriousness can be felt while watching the film. The film has some emotional moments when Padman fails as well as when Padman comes to know that his first Pad which was tested was successful. Best part of the movie includes the scene before interval which reminds of Toilet Ek Prem Katha scene. Mr. Arunachalam is given perfect tribute also in the starting credits as well as in the end which is a good part. The machine making is shown which is a very good part. BGM is very nice. Music of the film is fairly well and justified. Flaws in the film, I found 2 flaws. This film is spanned over some 8-10 years they could have shown some age difference in the looks of the characters it felt as if everything is happening in the span of 1-2 years only. 2nd flaw is the romantic angle in the later part of the film could have been avoided nevertheless it was also justified but it was looking like extra part in the film.Talking about the performances, Akshay Kumar as Lakshmikant Chauhan is fantabulous, one of the best performance of his career. Its another feather to his collection and it should not be a surprise if this act is considered for a national award. He has nailed it in every scene may it be demonstration of his machine or monologue in the end or testing pad on himself or making of the machine. Radhika Apte, has given amazing performance, she is having some amazing emotional scenes and she has performed beautifully. She perfectly suits in a village woman role with a narrow minded thinking. Sonam Kapoor as Pari has her moments in the film. She is the hero along with Lakshmikant. She has some amazing dialogues in her account. Other performances of Lakshmi's mother and sisters as well as 2 friends and Pari's father are also remarkable.\nAnd then there is the one and only Amitabh Bachchan, R Balki's favourite in the special appearance. Its just 2-3 minutes role but he stole the show in his own style. Amazing dialogues by him in just those 2-3 minutes. There are some clap worthy and whistle-able scenes too. R Balki's direction is classic. This is his personal best along with Paa. The camerawork is awesome. Locations in the film are not much important according to film but still Maheshwar is beautiful and it captures true village environment. Editing could have been a bit better but its good there is no unnecessary nuisance in the film.Overall the film is enjoyable, entertaining yet giving a very strong message and motivation. There is no logical error in the film as a normal audience and there is no scene which makes family audience feel awkward. There is no boring moment in the film which makes us feel that when is it ending. Its a motivating film after Dangal. Please don't miss it as we don't have many good movies coming every year.",

The costumes, the art-work, and editing are definitely added assets to the film. Amit Trivedi's score is lively and suits Balki's taste perfectly.

            "content": "Menstrual hygiene wasn't introduced in India until later in the 21st century, a social activist from South India introduces a tool to prevent from menstrual bleeding. So basically this film focuses on the aspect of menstrual hygiene in India.So a welder named Lakshmikant Chauhan based in a village in the rural of East India gets married and lives a blissful life until he notices the women in his village are suffering periods even in his family. Due to the lack of affordability for those sanitary pads, Lakshmi decides to change that by producing napkin pads but his idea leaves the villagers in doubt and gives them the feeling of embarrassment and shame. How Lakshmi changes that is basically what this film is about?Superman, Batman, Spiderman, and now Padman. R. Balki introudces a very straight on point script with deals with subjective matters of menstrual hygiene. This kind of hygiene is very essential for women across India which does have a very high poverty rate. Balki successfully shows the empowering factors of sanitary pads in such a way that managed to keep the audience engaged throughout those 140 minutes of the film.As far as performances go, Akshay Kumar literally nails it as Lakshmi. Luckily since Airlift, he has been upping his game especially in this film. His motives on menstrual hygiene was simply outstanding and that village mentality of a dropout as surprisngly something only Kumar can pull. Radhika Apte plays Gayatri, Lakshmi's wife who is against her husband's decision. She was great and simple but some dialgoues implemented by her were a bit off and it didn't comply too much to her character even as a villager.Sonam Kapoor was outstanding in Neerja but this film, it gave the audience the feeling especially me that she went on set just to earn a big quick big. Big B's appearance was quite a surprise.Direction was quite weak and this is something very common in R.Balki's films. He is very known for adding too mnay close up shots in 80% of the scenes and zooming too much will just cover up the background.Also there was a minor issue, it is okay to put comedy and drama which were both there but the script itself was a bit too factual. it is understandable that menstrual hygiene is a concept but putting too many of those elements will probably escalate the boredom in some scenes.Amit Trivedi's album is surely a winner and Mika Singh's take on the title song is simply a treat to devour for the next 4 minutes and Aaj Se Teri sung by Arijit Singh will put you in a romantic mood.Overall, 2018 is improving quite well at the start and this film will be counted in my top 10 best films of 2018. Nicely written backed up by a narrative concept also backed by powerful performances. But the direction of the film does dissappoint quite alot with the close ups but this is a perfect film.3.75/5 - R. Balki's most perfect film after Paa",

His character is very likable has he only has the purest intentions to something good for society. The story was inspirational and pretty well put together. I do feel that the first half of the movie dragged mostly because it became pretty repetitive and it probably could have been cut a bit shorter.

Your first inclination on viewing this story is another boring Indian family going through issues. Wrong! When you begin to discover it's about males dealing w/the female menstrual period which is culturally an extreme no-no; it starts to get interesting, eventually really interesting. Background: At the time this story begins, the 1990s, only about 12% of Indian women used a \"sanitary\" pad, the rest you ask? Newspapers, leaves, and a continually reused rag washed most likely in unsanitary H2O. So, a husband buys pads for 55 Rupees which the wife refuses to use in part because their high cost is beyond their low income level. The husband as a low education, hands-on laborer, decides to make some for his wife. That's when the fireworks begins. The subject is a culturally stigmatized superstitious taboo - mildly put. He's shamed, ostracized beyond belief as he asks questions, and researches. His goal is to build a machine to make them for 2 Rupees all \"for the safety of women\". Read only after seeing: It took him six years. Introduced his low cost pad maker to thousands of villages. Hired abused, cast out, unemployed women (many beggars, prostitutes) to make & distribute the pads. Has exported his machine to 29 poor countries. Named Time magazine's \"100 Most Influential People\" in the world. Guest speaker at the UN & TED.",

Its a story of a husband's compassion for his wife, for her safety and to break all stereotypes for it.

India is a huge country with diverse culture, religion and faith with its own issue and circumstances. But does all the belief and faith hold the right message ? Padman explores that ..Padman, based on one of the short story \"The Sanitary Man of Sacred Land\" written by Twinkle Khanna, tells the extraordinary story of an ordinary man , Lakshmi Prasad (Akshay Kumar), who changed the life of rural women in India by devising low-cost machine to build sanitary pads. Directed by R.Balki, who gave us some critically acclaimed films like Cheeni Kum and Paa, Padman is a bold step to explore the subject of menstruation and sanitary pads which is considered taboo in India. The film starts of very well with few scenes bringing smile on your face - Lakshmi Prasad buying the pads for his wife first time from a local medical shop, Lakshmi saving the life of his fellow-worker at the factory and even when he is trying to build the pads by using the cotton and leaves. The passion and determination of Lakshmi to know how the pad works and trying to make his wife and sisters use it will keep you glued to the screen. While the first half boast of some great scenes, the second half is a roller-coaster ride which stumbles down but picks up later in the climax. There are various reasons - the romance between Sonam Kapoor and Akshay Kumar is half-baked and out of place, the weird of Sonam Kapoor is itself does not make much impact, the lengthy pace and few unwanted scenes. Even the songs by Amit Trivedi is disappointing as none of it has chartburster touch (coming as a surprise from such a talented musician). Despite these hiccups, the impact of movie overall is a good as it helps to understand the pain what women goes through during those five days of period, especially a learning lesson for men. Though, it is okay to talk about it in Urban India, the subject is extremely sensitive in the rural India even though we are living in 21st Century. The screenplay is decent while editing is good, though trimming of few scenes and songs could have helped. Art direction is splendid while Cinematography is outstanding capturing the beautiful locations in Madhya Pradesh. Padman belongs to one and the only Akshay Kumar. The actor is just challenging himself to do good films on social cause and entertaining us with his superb performance. Though, he went overboard during one of the scene when he introduces his invention at the National Innovation Foundation conference, he will win your heart with a staggering speech at the United Nation ceremony, New York. Radhika Apte gives adequate support to her role. Sonam Kapoor, as usual, over-acted and does not justice to her character at all. I wish, the makers could have taken someone better.Padman is a refreshing journey of Arunachalam Muruganantham which should be lauded for its boldness and message for a cause. Good 3/5",

How on earth would Bollywood show that in the movies ? Hollywood might have made such a biopic, but Indian Film Industry...no chance.So, in 2016 when it was announced that a film based on Arunachalam Muruganantham's life is being made, i was quite surprised, what was even more surprising was that Akshay Kumar was going to play the lead. Akshay Kumar is known to play over the top characters, or do patriotic films, he had never done a movie like this. Finally when the time came for the movie to reveal itself to the audience, i was quite certain the creators would just talk about the issue on surface level and not go too deep into it, and there was no way they were going to show the things that Arunachalam actually did. But when the movie came out, i could not believe my eyes, they had done the impossible. R. Balki (Director) showed almost everything that Arunachalam did in order to achieve his bizarre goal.'Pad Man' is a fantastic film, very well made, completely different from what you would expect from an Akshay Kumar film. This is easily the most important film of Akshay Kumar's career. Movies like these are normally made with unknown actors and on a very small budget, most people don't even get to know about it's existence. With a superstar like Akshay Kumar, this story managed to reach millions of people, making it somewhat easier for people to talk about sanitary napkins. This movie is not a documentary, it has all the entertainment that a movie needs, there is an abundance of humour throughout the film and of course it has some outstanding music by Amit Trivedi.Pad Man entertains as well as educates. People living in urban areas use sanitary napkins but don't talk about it, women in villages don't use it and most people, specially men don't even know what 'Periods' are. The easiest way of removing the tag of taboo from a topic, is to talk about it and this film does exactly that. This movie deserves to be seen by everyone.",

            "content": "It is certainly appreciable that Indian films are choosing topics of social taboo and Pad Man is the latest one which talks about women's menstrual hygiene and their need to use sanitary pads. In our country, menstruating women are treated as outcast on these days and barred from entering temples and kitchens, it is a matter of debate, since it deals with belief system of many. So, it is a welcome change, when efforts are being made to talk about such topics of societal taboo and what best media other than a film to deal with such paradigm shift needed. Pad Man is a film which is inspired from the life of Arunachalam Muruganantham, a social entrepreneur from Coimbatore (Tamil Nadu). He is the inventor of low-cost sanitary pad-making machine. His innovative grassroot mechanisms for generating awareness about traditional unhygienic practices around menstruation has done wonders for women in rural India. He has not commercialized his mini machines which can manufacture sanitary pads for less than a third of the cost of commercial pads, rather he has chosen to sell it to self-help groups run by women. As per Wikipedia, these mini machines have been installed in 23 of 29 states of India, and he is planning to expand the production of these machines to 106 nations. (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arunachalam_Muruganantham) \nAlong with many awards conferred on him, he was included in Time Magazine's list of 100 Most Influential People in the World in 2014 and also Padma Shri in 2016 by Government of India. One thing which is to be noted is that Pad Man, as it is claimed by the makers, is not the first film on Arunachalam. Amit Virmani has made a documentary 'Menstrual Man', Abhishek Saxena made Phullu (2017) and there is another unreleased film \"I-Pad\" made in 2015 by Amit Rai. Twinkle Khanna had come out with 'The Legend of Lakshmi Prasad\" - a collection of four stories in 2016, out of which one story is \"The Sanitary Man of Sacred Land\" on which Pad Man is supposed to be based on. Of course, more the films on these subjects, it is good so as to create more and more awareness amongst people and get rid of taboo. So, Pad Man by R. Balki with Akshay Kumar and Radhika Apte in the lead is successful in creating the right buzz. R Balki has chosen to give fictional names to his protagonists Akshay Kumar and Radhika Apte and also he has picked up the backdrop of Bhopal rather than Coimbatore. R Balki and Swanand Kirkire as writers does mention the statistics as well in the film that only 12% of women in India use sanitary pads. They have kept the tone of the film very light without making it preachy. Sensibilities of the audience is taken into consideration. The emotions of the females, the belief system of considering oneself unsacred during menstruating days, not entering Kitchen / temples, the celebration (almost like mini-wedding) when a girl matures and the confusion of male fraternity are very well captured in the screenplay. Even the medical shop person selling the sanitary pad as if he is selling something illegal is very much relatable. What could have been avoided in the film is the love dynamics explored between Sonam Kapoor and Akshay Kumar, it appeared very clich\u00e9 and displaced. Lakshmikant Chauhan (Akshay) works in a welding factory. His sharp eye for details and fixing up things is evident from the very beginning of the film. He finds it very disturbing when he sees his wife Gayathri (Radhika Apte) using dirty clothes during her periods. In spite of Gayathri asking Lakshmi to stay out of ladies' problems, he does try his hand in making sanitary pads. His initial attempts fail miserably. What he finds it even more challenging is to get the pad tested. He makes desperate attempts to get the client, family, acquaintances etc. for his product but in vain. He is branded as eccentric, pervert and he ends up risking everything he has - his wife, family, home, village, social status etc. But nothing deters him from going ahead with his experimentation. It was a loner's journey for Lakshmi, but his go-getter attitude gives him slow yet steady success and that is how he invents low-cost sanitary pad-making machine. Another major challenge in front of Lakshmi was to get the buy-in for the pads from the women and that is when Pari (Sonam Kapoor), a young talented Tabla Player and MBA student, enters the scene. She not only becomes his first client but later on also becomes instrumental in creating user-base and roping in self-help groups run by women. The film has many high points be it Lakshmi's undying spirit to not accept defeat and continue with his experimentation, his genuine concern for wife and female hygiene, Lakshmi and Gayathri's chemistry, Lakshmi's efforts in managing to get the things one -by-one to invent the low-cost sanitary pad manufacturing machine, his 'Linglish speech' in United Nations, Amitabh Bachchan's cameo etc. The cast of the film perfectly fit into their respective characters very well. Akshay Kumar is effortless while playing Lakshmikant, he downplays himself wherever required. Radhika Apte is gorgeous as Gayathri and she has projected the shame associated with even discussing menstruation very well. Sonam Kapoor as Pari is good and gregarious. The best thing is writers R Bali and Swanand Kirkire has justified the presence of every character, even if it is a small role. Rakesh Chaturvedi as Professor is one such character, though has a small role, he becomes a reason for Lakshmi's shift in focus from making low-cost sanitary pads to inventing low-cost sanitary pad making machine. R. Balki's Pad Man inspired from Arunachalam Muruganantham's life showcases realistic performances from Akshay and Radhika and the film succeeds in dealing with a topic of societal taboo like menstrual hygiene with very much ease and finesse. It hits the bulls eye as far as enhancing social consciousness is concerned and it is bound to leave the ripples of cultural transformation for a very long time. Yes, we can announce confidently - India ke paas apna Superhero Pad Man hai.",

            "content": "I wish more such movies are made in Bollywood. Akshay Kumar astounds me with his knack of finding good stories and bringing them in the limelight. India needs to hear more stories like Arunachalam Muruganantham's. The man sacrificed his pride, his reputation, and his family even, to protect his wife and sisters from diseases. In turn, he created a revolution, protecting many other women's health and financial security.The story begins as an introduction to the family life of Lakshmikant Chauhan (based on Muruganantham) and the audience gets to know how he finds ways to help his family with their daily chores. Soon he realizes the problems his wife and sisters have to go through during their periods. To ensure their safety, he tries to make affordable pads that would help them live their lives better, but he runs into many hurdles over time.His first proper backing comes from Pari Walia, who steers him through these hurdles and pushes him to greater heights, ultimately helping him realize his dreams.I liked all three main actors. Akshay Kumar was fantastic and his performance as Lakshmikant Chauhan was very heart-warming. His Linglish (Lakshmi-English) was adorable and his speech at the UN was beautiful. Radhika Apte, as usual, breathes life into her character though I would have wanted to see more of her in the movie. Sonam Kapoor surprised me with her turn here. I used to have a bias against her but now I can see she has gotten much better in her craft and she was convincing as Pari Walia, the angel in Chauhan's life.I didn't quite like the feelings bit between Pari and Chauhan and would have liked that relationship to have remained pure and unlaced with any other feeling, but I guess this is a necessary evil with films. I enjoyed the rest of the story and honestly, the real life story of Muruganantham fascinated me. Many thanks to R. Balki and Akshay Kumar for bringing a story like this to the forefront.",

And Yes Padman is an EYE OPENER CLASSIC, A Sensitive but natural topic handle in a Sensible way by R Balki makes this one a MUST WATCH and also i expect some change in our Society regarding that Awkwardness about Pads.Acting- Akshay Kumar has given his Best Performance of this Decade. He's Sober, Kind Hearted yet down to earth. Radhika has done a Good Job being a typical Small town Housewife. Sonam appears after Interval but still makes her Presence feel strong with Sophisticated, educated, Bindass girl Accent.Writing- It's Strong as expected because you know it's a True Story and it's Inspiring so there shouldn't be any problem in writing a Great Script. But still few fictional material is irritating.Screenplay- When you get a Strong basic Script then you have to be very careful about screenplay and here it has hit the Right Chords. No Boring Moments, nothing to Dislike, expected Turn Arounds plus Emotional sequences. Everything is PERFECT.Music- Underwhelming. But this script actually don't need those typical Hit songs and useless chartbusters. All songs are Situational and fits properly in the film still that 'Ladki Sayani Ho Gayi' could have been removed.Direction- Balki does it again. He's always unique stories teller. But after Paa he was lost somewhere and has came back again to his Standard and delivers a Classic here. He has put enough commercial elements in the film, not making it too much overdose, doesn't lose basic Content, keeps reminding you that this is what happening in our Society and it's natural, there's nothing to be ashamed of.Final Words- Overall Padman is a Classic and will bring some change in our society regarding women's natural problem. I won't be surprised if Akshay and Balki will be called Superheroes by some Indian Women. Just go for this one, enjoy and come back home with a Grin smile on face, few tears in eyes and A Message in Mind. Padman deserves every single penny of your ticket purchase.

Very little little things or instances were taken care. e.g. \"Sayaani\" song by Yashita Sharma picture-zed on unique ritual for a young girl who has attained puberty.Music:After Secret Superstar, Amit Trivedi come up with another great music.

            "content": "There's a scene in Akshay Kumar's latest release, 'Padman', where he runs towards water with bloody pants. He's trying to make sanitary pads for his wife and decides to try one himself with animal blood. It's an incredibly brave scene in an equally brave film. In a country where talking about 'women's issues' is considered taboo one of its so-called 'masculine' superstars taking on the role of a man obsessed with making pads for his wife is nothing short of applaud worthy. He's the same star who was known for his khiladi attitude and rowdy films...and now we see him telling stories about toilets and pads. What a change! There's a lesson in there for all of us.Padman is inspired by the real life story of Arunachalam Muruganantham who spent 2 years developing a low-cost machine to make pads. Lakshmi's (Arunachalam's) tale in the movie is inspiring to say the least. His subject is shunned, his family disheartened, his wallet empty, yet this dropout from a rural town in India finds a way to succeed against all odds. And it's all done in a fearless manner. I can safely say you haven't seen anything like this at the movies.R. Balki, credited for directing and co-writing the movie, champions several social causes and entertains the audience with his most unlikely hero. There's gentle humor throughout the story that keeps the tone light albeit slightly preachy. Of course, you can't expect to reform society without some speeches and dialogues about morals and ethics. The first half of the film deals with Lakshmi's home life and you get to see just how unusual this man is even within his own family. For me, the second half is where the narrative scores. We see Lakshmi's innovative mind and his undying spirit which wins him awards, accolades, and even more detractors. The journey is thoughtfully conceived, written, and portrayed.Akshay takes to the character remarkably well. He infuses Lakshmi with a deep sincerity making you root for him even when the whole world thinks he's mad. Watch him deliver that 7 minute long speech at the UN in his broken english. You'll have a smile on your face the whole time. Radhika Apte plays his wife, Gayatri, who would rather die of a disease than shame. It's a painfully dull and typical character, if you ask me, but Radhika is a fine actress who brings honesty to the role. I wanted more from Gayatri which I didn't get but such is society. Sonam Kapoor's Pari springs a pleasant surprise in the 2nd half. She brings much needed color and hope to Lakshmi's life and infuses liveliness in the film.

            "content": "I really enjoyed this movie. Coming from an Indian woman raised in America, the subject of periods is perhaps less taboo than in other countries, but still not something people like to talk about. In the film we see how this natural function of the body is viewed in rural India, with the women being forced to sleep outside as if there is something to be ashamed of, and access to sanitary napkins not only unafforable but frowned upon.When Lakshmi (Askhay Kumar) marries Gayatri (Radhika Apte) and learns how the period is dealt with, out of his deep love for her as well as his sisters, he makes it his mission to create an affordable pad for all Indian women to access. This leads to pushback from not only Gayatri, but also his community, who do not think a man should be so obsessed with this subject matter.The story is a very moving one that I feel is important for not only men, but also women to watch. The acting is superb, perhaps the best I have seen in my limited experience with Indian films. There is a nice surge of energy when Sonam Kapoor's character joins the cast. The movie has everything you could want in a feel-good movie: comedy, drama, education, and even appropriate musical numbers.",

There are parts in the end where Akshay speech in UN and Sonam emotional extension looked bit dragging but otherwise I felt the movie was nicely put together. Even those aforementioned scenes are good when you look at the movie holistically. Akshay acting, Radhika and even sonam looked perfect but everyone else also played there part quite good and it is said when the movie is good, the whole things look good. I highly recommend to watch this movie and feel the pain a man goes through in showering his love and protection to his woman. It is also a romantic movie and the need of the time where people think beyond the box of bringing just two strangers to show love between them. Establishing love between a couple is what we need now so that love last long and not just until the day of marriage.",

He is the one who is responsible for selling sanitary pads at affordable price in rural India. He is also thus responsible to provide women employment, till certain extent. He has since been honored by national and international firms. The story addresses a man where he understands a problem gets onto something to eliminate it and keep trying deterministically till it's eliminated. Drama overdoes itself in first half. It should have been cut by ten minutes, to let efforts by main character fall into place at single trial after conclusion from his wife. Another instance is how miraculously he gets a member to use his newly built pads. Further she even becomes his best companion in work.Direction, Screenplay, Cinematography: Direction was good; screenplay was good and cinematography (that included still water, temple, village scenery, statue of liberty and UN stage) was good too.Music: Music is average.\n \nActing: I have been recently impressed by Akshay's work. Sonam and Radhika's work was also good.Final Verdict: Every other woman is aware of how costly these sanitary napkins are. If I am not wrong, they too would want access to these affordable pads. Let these have accessibility to every women. Arunachalam Muruganantham despite being poor achieves something. This is a story of achiever.",

Balki's 'Pad Man' is a heartfelt film, that is based on the true-story on Arunachalam Muruganantham, a social activist from Coimbatore, Tamil Nadu, who introduced low-cost sanitary pads for the betterment of woman. A noble true-story of a real-life hero, 'Pad Man' never soars as its Hero, but at least it has its heart at the right place & the performances are undeniably impressive.'Pad Man' Synopsis: Upon realizing the extent to which women are affected by their menses, Lakshmikant (Akshay Kumar, in good form) sets out to create a sanitary pad machine and to provide inexpensive sanitary pads to the women of rural India.'Pad Man' has a slow first-hour, where Lakshmikant faces objection, rebellion & humiliation, despite his noble idea of helping woman during their 5-day monthly periods. Considering this true-story is set in a rural town, the backlashes to the sensible & concerned Hero aren't very surprising. Even he makes perfect sense, nobody, including his wife (Radhika Apte, terrific), take his side. Its this hour of 'Pad Man' that wobbles, offering some moments that stand-out, but overall come across as repettive & slow-moving. The second-hour is engaging & offers wonderful moments in good portions. The arrival of the film's second leading-lady (Sonam Kapoor, warm & nice) & her understanding of Lakshmikant's obsession of making the pads & making sure they reach to as many as possible, brings the film the much needed pace. And when Lakshmikant does triumph, its hard not to be moved. And there's no denying that 'Pad man' is a sincere story, made with honesty.R. Balki & Swanand Kirkire's Screenplay, which is based on Twinkle Khanna's book The Legend of Lakshmi Prasad, offers heart. Its never solid enough to hold your attention all through, but its honesty is on-point. R. Balki's Direction is uncomplicated. He's made a simple film. Cinematography & Editing are decent. Amit Trivedi's Score has a few winning tracks.Performance-Wise: Akshay Kumar scores as Lakshmikant. As the Pad Man, Akshay portrays the simpleton with pure emotion. The actor particularly excels in the emotional scenes, where he genuinely touches your heart. Also, his speech at the United Nations, is sweet. Radhika Apte, as his long-suffering & innocent wife, is superb. The actress is in top-form, delivering an entirely realized performance from start to end. Sonam Kapoor is very likable. Amitabh Bachchan's cameo is alright.On the whole, 'Pad Man' isn't perfect, but it isn't without its share of merits either.",

It is a touchy subject and makes one uncomfortable to talk about even among the educated and urban class society. The social stigma attached to it is very deep and rooted and in a country like India, there are 100's of other superstitious omens besides being treated as filth.Visions to make a film on social subject and especially on such a touchy subject need not only guts but also solid content. This visionary director had a solid content in his silver platter in form of a Real life Padman and his inspirational journey, all he needed was the team to make it happen and I will applaud every crew member participated in this movie especially the lead Akshay Kumar.First of all it's a brave attempt and to succeed in it is exemplary. The 10 Min speech by Akshay Kumar addressing UN is the Best Inspirational/Motivational speeches I have ever heard so far in any film. I had tears in my eyes in the end & they were not only Because of the speech, they rolled down because I was totally engaged in what was happening as I was made aware of our situations and conditions in Indian Villages, I was made aware that the people can reach such great heights if their will and passion is put together towards their goals and because I was listening to a PADMAN (An uneducated guy explaining the business model) not the actor Akshay Kumar.Apart from the inspiring journey of Padman, I loved the subtle chemistry between Sonam and Akshay, The irritation and awkwardness Akshay created within his family and among the neighbors, the simplicity of the character he maintained throughout the movie and the detailed version of the success of his business model. I loved the movie and would recommend each and every person to watch.It is Akshay who has ruled over every other star in terms of Quality films this decade. This decade Akshay has given variety of movies on different topics but according to me Airlift and PADMAN stands out as the two Masterpieces of this decade. Highly Recommended!!!",

Balki, deals with the issue of menstrual hygiene. Before telling more, first the plot.\nThe film tells the story of Lakshmikanth Chauhan ( Akshay Kumar ), who after his marriage, realises to what extent his wife and all the other women are affected by their menses, and sets out to invent a low cost sanitary pad machine.\nAs you all know, the movie is based on the real life of Arunachalam Muruganantham, a social activist from Tamil Nadu. But the film is made suiting to the Northern sensibilities. Even though it's a biopic, never does it get serious or preachy. The director has balanced the movie with content and entertainment. There are many scenes in the movie which will leave a lasting effect on the viewer. One being the scene before interval, when Akshay decides to test the Pad he made by himself. And the other, Akshay's speech at the United NationsThe music of the movies was good. The songs 'Aaj se teri' and the Title track was really memorable. Cinematography too was done well.Now to the performances. It requires guts for an actor to act in a film dealing with a subject on menstrual hygiene. Akshay Kumar acts his part with perfection. It's his second film recently, after TEPK, which deals with a taboo subject. Raadhika Apte too impresses. Her moments with Akshay was really good. Sonam Kapoor plays her role good even though the love angle just before the climax was not required. Amitabh Bachchan appears in a cameo. Rest of the supporting actors have done their parts well. All I all PADMAN is a film to be watched. Highly recommended.My rating- 4/5",

Akshay Kumar, as the lead, is an bright, admirable lunk, able to switch from serious to romantic to clown and remain the same character.",

I am unable to understand that, this film is based on a real person Arunachal Muruganatham, based in Coimbtore then what was need to shift it in Madhay Pradesh, perhaps for subsidy! But it indirectly subsides the contribution of the genius and caring man behind this innovation. Film clearly lack it entertainment quotient which makes it slow. Most of time just information has been passed but in few scenes it has its hidden cute moments like when protagonist is looking for prospect to trail and attempts to convince different religion girls for it. First turning point comes with over drama when male lead tries it on himself but fails then he jumps into river which leads a social boycott. Similarly, when he designed its proper version then suddenly girls come to him asking for medical shop sounds too surreal. Pre climax speech is too preachy. After all this film should have been watched, talked to help in accepting the pad issue as essential part of life. Performance wise Akshay Kumar is first rate.

            "content": "In dry state Gujarat, film theaters were also facing dryness at the box office. Since, Padmaavat is not being released in this state, every cinelover or even normal people were waiting for a film to watch in theater. So, in the second month of the year, a film is out starring the most popular actor- Akshay Kumar in the titular role of Padman.Film is based on true story. Padman is a madman- This is what the villagers think. Because, He cares and thinks for the safety of his wife while she is having a period. He then understands the basic needs for women. How does he invent pads and after that what problems he faces to aware people for using those pads are the questions which will be covered during the film. And this film is the most entertaining film, I repeat, Most entertaining film!I found Toilet very slow and boring. But, this is super intriguing and paced based film. R. Balki is known for his unusual subjects. He is master in that. So, no doubt in that. Though I feel this film does not show his directorial efforts. But, kudos to him for his brave choices and also for, as of now, his biggest hit till date. Radhika Apte suits in her character of a village bride. She plays comfortably. Sonam Kapoor has one more hit in her career. Again she shines out, like she was in Bhag Milkha Bhag. She delivers her one of the best performances. Others are good. Balki's film is incomplete without Amitabh Bachchan, so brace yourself before watching his cameo! Akshay Kumar is the only actor who works for his audience. Now, he is bringing stories which have to be told worldwide. Also, I feel that he is becoming mature towards his acting and choosing subjects. No other actor can pull off this role as beautifully as him. This time I am feeling the vibes of him enjoying this role so much, as he always tries to help someone, especially women, and this character does the same! Amit Trivedi is known for his western music with cultural touch. You will feel this in Sayaani Song. Title song is good, too. Sweet, simple and suitable music. If you want shayari with simple words or even English words, Kausar Munir is the best lyricist. She can give you Tu Hi Hai from Dear Zindagi, as well as, Aaj Se Tera Ho Gaya in this one. With claps worthy dialogues, entertaining screenplay, Narmada, New York, IIT Delhi and Akshay Kumar all in one packet, this Padman will satisfy you for sure. The speech at UN by Padman was terrific. His monologue will be remembered for life long! With mixture of emotions, innocence and determination, anyone can come up with an innovation. Try to think besides yourself. The world is waiting for your invaluable ideas. JanSankhya (Number of people) is more in our country, so does ZahanSankhya (Number of Minds)! Think in the direction of betterment of people. Like Padmashree winner- The Original Padman did.",

            "content": "I had watched the trailer of PadMan, found it hilarious and was eagerly waiting to watch this movie. The wait was lengthened by a delayed release in a show of solidarity by Akshay Kumar to make way for Padmaavat. The movie is based on the book written by Twinkle Khanna titled \"The Legend of Lakshmi Prasad\" which in turn was inspired by the life of Arunachalam Muruganantham who invented sanitary napkin machines that manufactured cost-efficient pads making it affordable to rural Indian women. \n I generally look forward to Akshay Kumar starrers and I went to the theatre with high expectations. Moreover, I went with my crazy bunch of friends who, like me, do not believe in muffled laughter! \nThe movie begins with a song that shows Lakshmikant Chauhan (Akshay Kumar) making minor inventions to save his wife Gayatri (Radhika Apte) from the inconvenience of stinging eyes while chopping onions and bumpy rides, sitting on the cycle's cross bar (A reminder that the film showcases life in the 1990s when people didn't have the convenience of viewing easy life-hacks on YouTube) The film was shot in a village near Indore and records the journey of Lakshmi who initially starts off with wanting his wife to have better menstrual hygiene by using sanitary napkins rather than continue using the cloth. When she refuses to use the pad on account of the steep price, he takes it upon himself to make affordable pads not only for her but also for other women in his village. However, all attempts at getting his wife and other women to use the pads he made, fail. Lakhsmi is now labelled a pervert in his village who despite many a warning continues to meddle in \"ladies' affairs\" and speak openly about \"that, which should not be named\". Gayatri returns to her brother's house claiming that she'd rather die of unhygienic conditions than of shame that has befallen her. Lakshmi leaves his village and sets out on a quest that leads him to invent the sanitary napkin manufacturing machine and this is where Pari (Sonam Kapoor) makes her entry. Pari encourages Lakshmi on his journey of manufacturing affordable pads and distribute it amongst the rural women and also ends up with the pad being named after her. Though the length of time is not divulged, Lakshmi makes the headlines by winning an award at IIT and later on, the Padma Shri and is now looked up to by the people in his village.\nI had a sense of d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu whilst sitting through the whole film. It reminded me of 'Toilet', another Akshay Kumar starrer that had a similar storyline. The Husband in an attempt to improve the wife's state of living, brings to light a much larger albeit a taboo issue, the whole process which has him shunned by not only the society but also proved tumultuous to his marriage. \nThe movie, although has its funny bits, is a bit slow. The second half had us yawning and constantly checking our phones with the word \"pad, pad, pad\" ringing in the background. The actors have portrayed their characters well, the dialogues (especially the speech given by Lakshmi at the end of the movie) are entertaining, the movie succeeds in delivering the social message and yet the movie lacked the wow-factor. I suppose I was expecting too much from the Balki-Akshay duo. \nAlso, in an attempt to conform to the Bollywood-scene, the introduction of the love triangle and the superfluous \"kissing scene\" had us all shake our heads in disappointment. \nHad the movie not borne a stark similarity to Toilet-Ek Prem Katha, we would have probably enjoyed it a bit more.\nPeriod.\nP.S: the tagline in the title of this post is from one of the posters shown in the film welcoming Lakshmi back into his village.",

            "content": "The movie is a biopic on Arunachalam Muruganantham and covers the trials and tribulations that he faced during his journey to become one of the most important and respected Social entrepreneur world-over. A movie being made on such a taboo subject in a conservative society like India is big achievement and bigger is the achievement of Arunachalam Muruganantham, who in reality faced all this and maybe much more than this, but stood his ground and come up with such an innovation to make accessible, cheap sanitary pads for menstrual hygiene even to to the lowermost strata of society. Lakshmikanth Chauhan in movie is real life -Arunachalam Muruganantham.The movie comes to the point pretty early by opening with a song showing the marriage and love and care that Lakshmikanth Chauhan(Akshay kumar) has for his wife Gayatri(Radhika Apte) and out of that care arises Lakshmi's obsession to make cheap Sanitary pads for his wife as branded ones were too expensive to afford for him for his wife and sisters. But this obsession of his makes him try too much and the subsequent failures bring embarrassment to him and his family. All this reach such a point that he was seen as pervert who is possessed or has some contagious sexual disease in village and his sisters , wife , mother all move away from him , so he decides to leave the village. Though all this humiliation separates him from his family but fails to separate him from his obsession to get a 100 % working sanitary pad for his wife at lowest cost and from here on starts his journey to gain knowledge and make a sanitary pad as good as branded one at dirt cheap cost. Testing the pads for their efficacy was one hurdle he had failed to cross from start but there arrives a fairy for this padman- Pari(Sonam Kapoor) who helps him pass not that testing hurdle but also stands by him during tough times and takes his mission from village to village so much so that he names the pads - pari. Whether he settles with pari or his wife returns is revealed subsequently in the movie.Radhika Apte plays an innocent village girl who has traditional mindset,got her look and mannerism perfect .Radhika is known to be a bold women in real life so playing a contrasting character with so much conviction deserves applause. Sonam looks cute and plays suave urbane girl who gets bowled over by simplicity of Lakshikanth and decides to give his dreams a wings to fly. Sonam also plays her role with elan. Rest of the character actors looked in place with their act. Akshay kumar shed his street smart hero image once again and is very good as a simpleton with an innocence and unwavering dedication and conviction to achieve what he has set out for. The extent to which Akshay has got hold of the character can be easily understood by seeing real Arunachalam Muruganantham. videos.Background music is excellent so are the songs Aaj se teri and Padman. Cinematography is top notch for such a low budget movie. The Movie slows down a bit after interval as what Lakshmi sets out to be has been achieved by that time and focus has shifted to how far has his innovation benefited people but then picks up with his UN speech,20-25 minutes before the end. So the pacing of the movie is nice. Director has done commendable job by bringing some amount of entertainment and yet not losing the essence of the film - i.e. to tell the complete story within 140 minutes as close to reality as possible.Some of the High points or scenes i liked \nLakshmiKanth(will use Lakshmi for him) UN speech\nAllegory where Lakshmikanth uses sanitary pad on a bleeding arm cut\nScenes exposing how 50 rs is too much for menstrual hygenie but nothing when shelled out in name of religion showing various tricks to befool people\nLakshmikanth - Pari 1st meeting\nAffectionate scenes between Lakshmi and pari\nLakshmikanth trying sanitary pads himself .This move is an example of how one can keep the movie realistic and bold and yet add some entertainment value . I would have rated this movie a 9/10 because a big section is devoid of much entertainment value, But then added an extra 1 for making this BOLD movie in a realistic manner and that too at commercial level with one of the biggest Indian superstar. So its 10/10. Anyone who complains of Bollywood not moving out of comfort zone would really love and relish this one .",

            "content": "The film revolves around life of Lakshmikant Chauhan (Akshay Kumar) based out of a village in Madhya Pradesh and his inspiring journey of spreading awareness about menstruation and smashing taboos associated with it in the conservative society. Now, first of all let us all agree that it was indeed brave of Akshay to touch upon this subject, given his massy appeal. There is a probability that aam junta might shy away from watching the film because of its unconventional content. But the makers have made sure that there is enough publicity going around which will make people shun their ignorance and embrace this cause wholeheartedly. So, a newly married Lakshmi is a welder but extremely curious about female menstruation and is disturbed by the lack of sanitation or awareness around it. It all starts when he finds out that his wife Gayatri (Radhika Apte) uses dirty cotton cloth for the lack of sanitary pads during her periods. He then fashions a cotton pad and persuades his wife to use the same. Despite repeated attempts, he fails to make a sustainable napkin. His relentless pursuit to make the perfect sanitary napkin leads his entire family to disown him until he manages to convince the society that menstrual hygiene is a burning topic which needs to be addressed.Akshay Kumar is at his natural best in the garb of a village bumpkin Lakshmi. The supporting cast of Radhika Apte, Mrunmayee Gokhale and Jyoti Subhash are brilliant, complementing his performance. The first half is filled with a lot of bittersweet moments between Akshay and Radhika but one scene that stood out for us was just before the interval. Lakshmi, in an attempt to make a full proof napkin, attaches an animal blood pouch to his waist making the blood drip steadily into his handmade pad. Thinking that his job is done, he happily strides away only to realise to his dismay that the pad is leaking. The mere sight of Akshay taking a plunge into the nearby river with soiled pants is moving, impactful and breaks stereotypes in every way possible. It is indeed brave for a mainstream Hindi film hero to attempt something like this. The dialogues written by Swanand Kirkire and R. Balki are funny, emotional, bringing out a very earthy side of the lead hero. Though we felt that Lakshmi's UN speech could have been shorter.In the second half, director R. Balki slips a little bit as the film gets too technical showing Lakshmi building a pad manufacturing machine from scratch. The editing treatment given to these bits by Chandan Arora could have been tighter. Also, Sonam Kapoor's entry is a little too convenient and the way she begins her association with the PAD MAN Akshay is a tad bit filmy. Sonam tries to deliver an honest performance as a confidante and marketing guru to Akshay's character but there is little focus on her in the movie. She however tries to make the best of what she has, engaging us for most part. Despite saying this, a love angle created by the makers between her and Akshay seemed forced and unnecessary.The screenplay (R. Balki) is quite engaging and entertaining. It sure drops at a few places but eventually manages to pick and keep you glued to the story.Since this film, which is inspired by the life of Tamil Nadu's social entrepreneur Arunachalam Muruganantham, is adapted to suit North Indian sensibilities for greater viewership, PAD MAN is shot across scenic locales of Maheshwar, Indore and Mahu in Madhya Pradesh. PC Sreeram has done an excellent job with the cinematography. The camera work is beautiful and expansive capturing the simplicity of the lifestyle of the people living there. One finds a massy connect in the way characters are treated as far as their costumes, dialogues and overall appeal is considered.Amit Trivedi's music is good but not spectacular, to be honest. Only two tracks 'Aaj Se Teri' and Pad Man title track stand out but then there is little scope for the music when the film is so heavy on content.It is worth mentioning here that Akshay Kumar manages to maintain perfect gravitas as a feminist icon who is emotional and passionate about his cause. It is indeed applause worthy for him to take a taboo topic (after TOILET: EK PREM KATHA) and make a commercial film out of it, without letting it get too preachy for its own good. Also, it is interesting to note that Balki's gallery has always been the urbane multiplex going audience and yet he pleasantly surprises us by making a rooted film which has the potential to cut across class/caste barriers.On the whole, PAD MAN is a brave and an inspirational attempt at creating a commercial cinema out of a taboo topic. The movie scores high on content as well as emotions. At the box office, Akshay Kumar's mass appeal will surely help to pull in the audiences. It has the potential to grow steadily at the box-office with the positive word-of-mouth. Period.",

The film also stars Radhika Apte as Akshay's wife and Sonam Kapoor as tabla player. The film 'Pad Man' is a real life story of Arunachalam Muruganantham, the man who wore a sanitary pad to break a taboo. It is a reality that Muruganantham tried his best to find a way to make cheap, affordable sanitary napkins for women in his village. It is his devotion to dedication towards a noble cause. Pad Man is a film based upon his life. While making the film scriptwriter has made many changes but kept the real life synthesis as it is. When I watched this film, I liked the way it is been scripted. I liked the dialogues. There are many characters who come speak very ordinary and camera is kept at a distance as a third person point of view but the impact what we get is beyond words. When I say beyond words, I mean it. There are times, when situations gives us hint, clue or twist in the story all this takes place through not so important characters. Film compel us to think, sympathize with character and support them. All things takes place through action and not through words. I find this style of script and dialogue is a new in Bollywood. R.

For an average movie goer it's not going to be for the movie making, rather the story of this real life superhero.The movie starts with a few funny lines that'll get audience to chuckle, has one good title song, a few heart touching moments.The movie could do better in terms of blending in to the early 2000 indian village setting, even akshay himself. It doesn't take you in, you'll always be very aware of your cinema seats.Radhika has done a fantastic job.Sonam delivers great acting but the character itself feels forced in to create a love triangle and modern pretty women charm. Audience will have varied opinions on that.The second half gets too technical and preachy. This is where the movie goes of track a little.Plenty of life lessons to be learnt, if you're on for that kind of thing. Salute to the team for taking a taboo subject and making it into a good movie that can be enjoyed by everyone. Everyone in your family will enjoy this movie. It's not all just menstruation talks but a good blend of comedy, family, live lessons, culture, dogmas, and more.Enjoy the movie.",

            "content": "\"Only twelve percent women in India are able to afford sanitary pads\", the reason why these women retort towards using dirty clothes, newspapers, leaves and in some cases even ashes during their menstrual cycle. 'Padman' is the story of Padma Shri Mr. Arunachalam Muruganantham who was able to provide the solution to this adverse problem.Lakshmikant Chauhan(Akshay Kumar), a newly-wed machine tool operator resides in a small village of Madhya Pradesh with his wife, mother and his sisters. Lakshmi has a knack of understanding the mechanism of machines. This helps him in creating daily-use tools using any object. One day when he learns about the menstrual problem of his wife Gayatri(Radhika Apte), he suggests her to use sanitary pads instead of a dirty cloth. Women in early days were not allowed to live inside the house during their five-day cycle. But like most women she is not able to afford them and hence asks him to return those.After learning about the dangerous health problems of such negligence, he takes it upon himself to make sanitary pads. In his attempt to understanding the quality of these pads he takes the help of his wife, sisters and medical college students. But when they refuse to cooperate he himself tries this process after which his mother disowns him and his wife leaves him.But this doesn't deter Lakshmikant who leaves his village thus starting his journey to find the correct formula. When he finally discovers how the pad-creating machine operates, Lakshmi decides to make his own low-cost machine using his sharp skills. Aiding him in this effort is Pari(Sonam Kapoor), daughter of an IIT Professor who not only tries the pad herself but also helps in distributing the affordable pads village-to-village.Kudos to R Balki and Twinkle Khanna(who has previously written a book, 'The Legend on Lakshmikant Prasad' on the same man) on bringing this hard-hitting story to the silver-screen. 'Padman' is an inspiration, a story of a man who broke the social taboos in our country just by staying true to his vision. Some moments in the movie could have been exploited better and there is also a forced love story in between but nothing takes the spotlight from this praiseworthy effort. The first half of the movie takes a bit more time in building the story which makes the second half feel rushed.The movie has been carried on his shoulders by Akshay Kumar who portrays the struggles and failures of the character in such demeanour that you relish every small success he achieves. He has been well supported by a graceful Sonam Kapoor and and abject Radhika Apte. Radhika gives another performance to cherish after 'Parched' about a woman brought-up in an environment where women are ashamed of talking about a natural activity even with her own husband.There are movies which are able to do justice with the true visionaries of our world and 'Padman' is one such tale. We wish Mr. Muruganantham achieves his dream going forward and wish luck for his future adventures.",

The religious aspect of the issue - where menstruating women are supposed to isolate themselves and live outside the house during the cycle (mostly in rural India) because they are considered impure - also bothers him, which is why Padman looks like it has been written with a complete contemplation of the issue.

The narrative is not at all consistent and the first half drags so much without making any point. But the subject and its reality are so powerful that when the film works it hits them hard. How the society reacts at each point just makes me ashamed of my country and even though I haven't directly seen such situations or people I can't deny the probability of such occurrences. Even though the subject is kind of approached superficially the importance and social effect of the film that can be felt through some of the moments in the film make it worth it.",

This is the reality. This issue is turned to a film. So the storytelling should have been more suggestive. But it is more raw in is representation and goes a little inclined towards portraying dark vulgarity. On the other hand if it were a biography then reality should been genuinely portrayed, instead it felt like fantasia among reality. Some of them are -----\n1. Lakshmi doing phone with no other enterprise information, orders his things to his village. Is it a joke?2. Lakshmi struggle in making the pad device felt like the easiest job ever.3. His talks in UN felt like a joke.Sonam is pure feminist keep on insulting Lakshmi whenever she gets chance. There are many dialogues regarding this. I rate 4 out of 10 only to the song Aaj teri.

It's able to cover a sensitive subject with grace, Kudos to the film crew on picking up a topic, which while natural is still considered a taboo in our society. The movie is about a mans obsession in making a cheap sanitary pad.\n\nThe first half of the movie is on the trial and error of the first try at making a pad, the embarrassment and social ostracism our protagonist goes through.\n\nThe second half is about him reaching his goal and going a leap forward in taking it to the world. The joy of making a perfect product, popularizing it across villages and getting reorganized for it makes it's a cheerful watch. The addition of some great dialogues and humor only add to the watching experience. \n \nThe performances across the board were perfect, Akshay Kumar shines in his portrayal of goal obsessed manic, Radhika Apte is the perfect image of a rural housewife still stuck with its traditional beliefs & Sonam Kapoor is a breath of fresh air with her urban sensibility. \n\nPS: The movie is based on the short story The Sanitary Man of Sacred Land in Twinkle Khanna's book The Legend of Lakshmi Prasad, which is inspired by the life of Arunachalam Muruganantham, a social activist from Tamil Nadu.",
