            "content": "Saw 'Vice' for quite a few reasons. The subject was fascinating as is Dick Cheney himself. That it was positively reviewed, well mostly, and got the awards attention it did (yes, have always taken the big awards more seriously than others because while there have been questionable wins and even nominations in every category every year there are just as many that are richly deserved), showed a lot of promise.Also really liked 2015's 'The Big Short', another positively reviewed Adam McKay film, and what was especially good in that film also came over to me as particularly good here in 'Vice'. My main reason though, and this seems to be true of a lot of films seen recently (both those released this year and first time viewings for all years), was the cast. Hard to go wrong with Christian Bale, Amy Adams, Sam Rockwell and Steve Carrell (who is good and more with good material).While full potential is not fully achieved and it is a bit uneven and messy, a larger part of me really enjoyed 'Vice', which did impress me with its ambition and invention. It is a film that will hugely entertain a good number while challenging others, and will be and is even a polarising experience more than understandably. As said it is a long way from perfect and between this and 'The Big Short' the latter is the better film. Am going to agree with those that criticised the editing, which does go too over the top on the intended quirkiness and like it was trying too hard to be inventive and it comes over as choppy instead.The story execution, while mostly compelling, does suffer zig zagging to and fro too much, which gave it an unfocused feel that didn't always make the film feel cohesive. So it did come over as a bit rushed and muddled at times, and it definitely could have benefitted from trying to do less and not go over the top on the details. Was a little mixed on the narration, it has a lot of clever moments (and was not expecting the twist regarding it) but there were times where it wasn't necessary and intruded a bit.'Vice' however has a lot that is good. Although there were reservations with the editing, there was some quite audacious photography that succeeds better at being inventive and the production/locations and costuming show great care in making the time and place clear. The best thing though visually was the makeup for Cheney, which was a masterstroke and rendered Bale unrecognisable. The film is tightly directed by McKay and the music is a beautiful mix of melancholic and uplifting. While the story is not flawless by any stretch, it is still very compelling even when more deliberate than 'The Big Short' and told with great gusto. It is a tough and very relevant subject, handled in a way that hits hard. Two things are especially good in 'Vice' though.One is the script, which is often darkly hilarious, unsettling in its frank truth, very informative even though the amount told to us is vast and bleakly tragic. The other is the cast, with all the actors on point and make their characters well rounded (the negative portrayal of Cheney though is polarising, his family objected to it, and some may find it on the biased side, but to me he avoids caricature). Bale is magnificent, one of his best performances this decade and it shocked me seeing him this cold and menacing. Adams is just as powerful a presence and their chemistry is eerily twisted. Rockwell is always great and Carrell is fun to watch while never resorting to silliness. Tyler Perry shows too that his performance in 'Gone Girl', a brilliant film and he was surprisingly good in it, wasn't a fluke in an another relatively against type role.In a nutshell, good but not great. 7/10",

            "content": "In 2008, Italian director Paolo Sorrentino made a film about a, then, still living sinister political figure Giuliano Andreotti. The ferociousness of the portrait was acceptable to the public at large because it was presented as a stylish, slightly surreal comedy. Adam McKay sets VICE in a more realistic universe but the results are just as pungent, disturbing and funny. Christian Bale is spookily perfect. And Amy Adams is a modern day Lady Macbeth of major proportions. The most unsettling part of the whole experience, because Vice is an experience, is the knowledge that this are the people chosen by the people. The fact that countries have the governments they deserve gives me a chill in 2018. A remarkable film with remarkable performances. Bravo.",

            "content": "It puts \"Hereditary\" to shame. However, I disagree with critics' assertions that director McKay set out to make Cheney seem like a complete monster. He often humanized him, and there were a couple of moments when a few of the members of my audience got somewhat emotional. If you had asked them before the movie if they were going to shed a tear while they watched it, they probably would have replied, \"HELL NO.\" Also, whereas I would state firmly that there was ZERO link to anything that involved 9/11 and Iraq, McKay provides a very tenuous, dubious possible link to him-- which later completely boomerangs into Cheney's face.\nTo put it bluntly, it was the worst administration of all time, and as the film states early, I think that many Americans have either forgotten it or never really paid attention to it completely. When Democrats describe their worst fears of possible Trump disasters, I don't think that they know that they are describing things that *actually occurred* during the first decade of this century. When Bale as Cheney looks directly into the camera and delivers a monologue-- or postmortem-- about his tenure as vice president, it might remind you of Emperor Palpatine's rationalizations in the Star Wars prequels. As the film shows, at the time there were justifications for unitary executive privilege that were written by a single moron and apparently regarded as gospel-- and can be used as precedent by future presidents. And I probably don't need to remind you about the most unjustified, wasteful, moronic and disastrous war in American history, which he strongly advocated and for which the entire world is continuing to pay a heavy toll. This film is actually important.Finally, Bale is my choice for best lead actor of 2018. It was a tour de force performance.If this film has any slight problems for me, I didn't like some of its artistic license. Sometimes I wanted it to be more straightforward. But it's a must watch.",

            "content": "As Adam McKay's follow-up to The Big Short (one of my favorite films of 2015) he is back with another dark satirical comedy.Just like in The Big Short, the amount of information McKay throws at you is a little overwhelming, especially if you don't fully understand it. It is a little slower paced of a movie, but the way he frames every scene has such gusto that you can't take your eyes off the screen.Other than the brilliant script the main thing to note in this movie is the perfect casting. Christian Bale and Amy Adams teaming up again, this time as Dick and Lynne Cheney further prove they should team up in every movie together. Christian Bale is so believable as Dick Cheney that you suddenly forget that you are even watching Bale at all. Then you have Steve Carell as Donald Rumsfeld, Sam Rockwell as George W. Bush, Tyler Perry as Colin Powell, Naomi Watts, Lily Rabe, Jesse Plemons (in a role that I did NOT see coming), and plenty more.There is a fantastic scene between Lynne and Dick where Plemons' character narrating notes - that we wouldn't know what they actually would have said in this certain moment, but he images it would be something quite Shakespearian. Then Lynne and Dick start talking like they are in Macbeth. Their chemistry is just fantastic and you get to see how much Lynne stepped up, and her ambitions and reservations with going into this political world.As much as this movie paints Cheney as a villain, McKay still gave him depth and compassionate moments, and showing all of his health troubles. You really see how this man became the most powerful VP that we have ever had in the history of the U.S. Presidency and how scary that is because it is all true. We have lived it.This movie is definitely not for everyone but I really enjoyed it. There is a funny after credits scene that shows how divided our country is, and the quote above is exactly what you should be asking yourself at the end of the movie. So, what do we believe?",

A pseudo-documentary/dramedy biopic that tells the story of Cheney's political career while skewering the Republican Party & Washington DC politics in general, from the Nixon administration to today. It brings to light how politicians will sell-out everything in the pursuit for power, just how much sway one person can hold in politics, how media was forever changed under the Bush administration, & how all of this is still effecting us today. It's a film that has as many laughs as it does moments of bitter truth, many of them bleeding into each other. Again putting his body through a drastic change for a role, Christian Bale is absolutely incredible as Dick Cheney with his mannerism & glare down perfectly. I'm just as impressed with Amy Adams, Steve Carell, & Sam Rockwell. The editing is fantastic & the narrator was an interesting touch, especially once it's revealed who he is in relation to Cheney. And the mid-credits scene perfectly expresses what the reactions to this film will be.",

            "review_title": "Adam McKay and His Stellar Cast Deliver a Funny and Thought Provoking Movie",
            "content": "I was able to see this at an advanced screening. What got me excited to go see Vice, along with the stellar trailer, was Adam McKay's involvement as the writer/director. His work on the Big Short was amazing and he's shown a lot of growth as a filmmaker. This was a big subject and with his ability to explain complicated issues, I was sure I was in for something memorable. I left the theatre impressed with the fact that he was able to replicate his style in Vice. He has the unique explanations and jokes down pat and while I wanted even more, the movie kept me entertained throughout with lots of laughs and some gripping drama.With McKay being a famous democrat supporter, do you think he was a big fan of Dick Cheney (played here by Christian Bale)? The movie is definitely of the mind that he's a manipulative force that cares little for humanitarian solutions to terrible problems throughout the world as opposed to a patriotic visionary. But despite that, I was shocked that the movie tried to give Cheney some humanity through his interactions with his daughter Mary (Alison Pill). He also has a couple of tender moments with his wife Lynne (Amy Adams). I read interviews that McKay did where the question was if his movie about Cheney would be poorly received by both sides of the American political aisle. Is it too harsh for conservatives but too light for liberals? I think this is accurate, Cheney is sculpted throughout the movie he starts out as a dolt but slowly grows into his role and develops fangs of his own. It may be too middle ground for some, but I thought they played it almost right. Cheney's ending monologue shows how he really feels about his legacy (its right out of the House of Cards playbook and it was the best moment of the movie for me) but I'll credit McKay for holding back a little bit as opposed to going for the jugular.If the subject matter doesn't immediately catch your eye, maybe the star-studded cast will. Christian Bale stars as our protagonist Dick Cheney, he's a total chameleon and I honestly forgot I was watching someone performing as Dick Cheney. The awards and accolades he's going to get for this are well deserved. The supporting cast are equally up to the task, Amy Adams does a wonderful job as Lynne. She's a veteran and she is owed just as much credit as her male co-stars for taking what could be a forgettable part and doing a lot with it. I thought Sam Rockwell did a more understated job as George W. Bush than I expected. He plays up Bush's confusion and ignorance, but his portrayal isn't as malicious, and I think he was great. Steve Carell has turned into an elite dramatic actor, he gets the job done here, I think he has the least amount of meat to his part but he's solid. There were lots of recognizable faces in cameo and brief supporting parts, some of my favourites were Jesse Plemons, Alfred Molina, Tyler Perry, Alison Pill, Naomi Watts and Don McManus.I'm happy to keep showering this movie with praise but I also didn't completely fall in love with it. The first third to half of the movie can drag, it contains a lot of pertinent information about Dick and Lynne Cheney and while there are moments, there were stretches where I was waiting for it to pick up the pace. Vice has the wild sense of style that I wanted from it, with the cutaways for jokes and visual representations and they brought the laughs. I just wanted more of that in Vice. The trailer for this movie portrays Vice as a straight comedy, this movie also packs a lot of drama (its more dramatic than McKay's previous work the Big Short) and its deeply affecting. But while there are some small concessions to the Cheney family (more than I expected them to) the direction of the slant on Cheney's story is decidedly one way. I went to this advance screening with a conservative friend and it wasn't his cup of tea.I love the direction that McKay's work is going, I still prefer the Big Short to Vice because it was more comedy than drama and it was such a fresh take on a complicated subject. While he also does a decent job of explaining the intricacies of Cheney's backroom dealings, he never loses sight of the point he's trying to make. Cheney's reign as VP led not only the USA but the free world in the direction we now find ourselves currently sitting in. This is another movie that knows who their audience is and disregards the rest, if you're conservative or a republican voter, don't expect different than what you see in the trailer. This isn't a heroic tale of Cheney, his family or his colleagues and while I was surprised that they gave Cheney some humanity, he's the villain of the piece for sure. I really enjoyed this but I'm firmly at an 8.5/10 and I must round up to a 9/10. If you're in the target demographic for the movie, are interested in seeing a funny but informative look about the George W. Bush administration or want to see what should be a big contender come awards season, Vice is definitely worth showing up to the theatre to see.",

            "content": "Christian Bale delivers a remarkable performance worthy of the hype and the Oscar (sadly, he did not win). The acting is great across the board. Rockwell might be the second best in film, while Steve Carell and Amy Adams were similarly excellent.Director Adam McKay holds this movie back from being great. He lays on the metaphors with the thickness of grandma's lasagna. And much like when eating the lasagna, a little goes a long way. Unfortunately, McKay feeds us an unneeded second helping. And a third.That's not to say Mckay did a terrible job directing this movie. He didn't. Most of the film has a strong, resonant message wrapped in an entertaining and hilarious packaging. Much like in \"The Big Short,\" McKay cleverly communicates complicated material in a way that's easy for any viewer to understand. And this is all accomplished without being condescending, except for when it is.McKay doesn't put enough trust in viewers to comprehend what he's saying. The cutaways to literal representations of hunting and fishing feel a bit insulting and clunky. They're unnecessary. Christian Bale is masterful chef. Just keep the camera on him and let him cook.For the most part, the movie is thoroughly enjoyable, largely because of the way it sheds light on the ridiculousness of the events unfolding. It's a funny movie at times because it's so appalling. Other times it's too appalling to be funny.Critics may point out that the story is not a bi-partisan take. To be clear: it's not and it's not trying to be. McKay is disgusted by what Dick Cheney and other political figures did, and he makes his feelings painfully clear. This approach leads to some of the movie's most fascinating moments but also led to its partial undoing. If McKay had just been willing to trust that moviegoers would understand his message if presented it with a touch more subtlety (they would have) this would be a smarter and more ultimately more widely praised film.",

Who else who only made it to the office of Vice\nPresident managed to have a movie made about them. The only other one was\nAaron Burr.There's not much about Dick Cheney that I had not already known. The story of\na hell raising kid from Wyoming who rose to be among the movers and shakers\nof our country might be considered an American success story. If he had only\nused his talents for the creation of a little good in the world I might be more\nfavorably disposed.As a Vice President Cheney is also unique in truly becoming an assistant President and actually making policy. In our history the only other one like that who comes to mind is Martin Van Buren who Andrew Jackson's Vice\nPresident in Jackson's second term.The real surprise in this was Amy Adams who played Lynne Chaney. I never knew that much about her and she has a really great scene where kickstarts\nher drunken boyfriend Cheney basically saying shape up and make something\nof yourself in this world that men run. Fascinating the response here. Lynne\nChaney says work the system, someone like Ruth Bader Ginsburg in the same\nsituation makes up her mind to change things. Amy Adams got a Best Supporting Actor nomination as did Sam Rockwell for Best Supporting Actor.Still Vice is driven by the Best Actor nominee Christian Bale and his portrayal\nof Richard Cheney. It's a many sided portrayal and Cheney does not come out\nall bad. For instance he's shown as being supportive of his lesbian daughter\nMary Cheney. Qualify that by saying he also realizes among the crowd he seeks to court for votes having an out lesbian daughter isn't going make him\nfriends. Lynne Chaney realizes that even more.Bale got an Oscar nomination for Best Actor and the film was up for Best Picture and several other awards. It only won in the Makeup category.Most interesting role was that of Jesse Plemons, an every man sort of character who narrates the film and has a unique relationship with Richard\nCheney.

This shines a very interesting light on a figure who had way more influence than many people knew at the time and maybe still are not aware of.And take Bale now - you might already be aware that he takes his acting seriously. Now with added makeup this goes even further. No wonder this won an Oscar (I don't think anyone bet against that) in that department. Sam Rockwell almost gets drowned/forgotten about in all this. And his George H.W. Bush Jr. is as good as Bale Cheney is. So while we can and probably will be stunned by the performances and how close they are to the real thing, the movie itself is gripping too. So it's not just a gimmick...this really is good",

And hand Bale a best actor golden globe and Oscar!) It begins so unlikely that this under performing and common Wyoming cowboy guy who loves the bottle and beer will make it anywhere. As after flunking out of an Ivy league college Dick appears down in the dumps. Yet his rock and stone wife Lynne(in a blunt and elegant turn from Amy Adams) advises him to shape up or ship out and change his ways.It's upon a congressional internship that Dick's meeting and making a connection with Donald Rumsfeld(Steve Carell) changes his life forever. Soon and later Dick's connections in Washington get him somewhere as he becomes a chief of staff to the president, runs and gets elected to congress, then serves as secretary of defense, then he's the CEO of a large corporate business company. Now talk about a lucky man!However old Dick has his problems and is from time to time behind the 8 ball as he's overweight with a pot belly and his ticker is not the greatest as heart problems almost derail his life and career. Plus his youngest daughter is gay. Yet by being an insider with connections Cheney stays the course as his biggest gift and surprise awaits. Now what!? Yes Dick is named vice president a running mate on the ticket of George W. Bush(in a life like performance from Sam Rockwell). And in a close razor thin 2000 presidential election Bush-Cheney win! Now he's the VP!Now with unlimited access and connections of corporate and business dealings it's back room and under the table deals that let Dick's power grow to unseen levels. As it's clear that Cheney though second in charge pushed all of the major buttons in the Bush administration. As his advice and inner workings played a key role in the Iraq war which seem to be driven by money and greed and oil along with ego and a power trip.Overall super film for any who enjoy bio type movies about politics and history no matter what your political side, and no matter if you where a fan of Cheney or not like him or hate him, see this film as it shows how one man gained unlimited power thru access of connections. As it's clear Dick Cheney was clearly the most powerful Vice president of our time who was tough as stone and ruthless.",

I'll reduce my complaint to one glaring omission which brings into focus how tendentious this movie is:We are shown the NYTimes editorial by Joseph Wilson that angered the White House into retaliating: someone (the movie blames Cheney, which is plausible) leaks the fact that Wilson's wife, Valerie Plame, is a CIA agent, blowing her cover.The Times may have been innocent in \"Plamegate,\" but it, and nearly all of mainstream media, has blood on its hands for having supported the Administration's blatantly false claims that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction. Cheney alone isn't responsible for the invasion of Iraq-- far from it-- yet that is what McKay very clearly implies, leaving the media off the hook.We shouldn't forgive the media, or McKay for giving the Times a pass.On the upside, Christian Bale's performance is as close to a perfect imitation as I can imagine, and Sam Rockwell brings expert comic subtlety to his portrayal of Bush II.",

So how did he, with Dick Cheney biopic Vice, make a movie about a mysterious and ruthless American tyrant so dull and unenlightening? Flaunting many of the bursts of randomness we've come to expect in his satirical outings, at one point he has his characters speak in Shakespeare-like prose, unintentionally recalling the Bard's old adage, \"...full of sound and fury, Signifying nothing.\" That is Vice, one of the most pretentious and obnoxious films in years.\nA \"comedic\" expose on the life and career of Bush Jr.'s VP Dick Cheney, it's not so much a story as a chaotic collection of random moments. It doesn't work as either an empathetic vision of a complex man (i.e. Oliver Stone's W.), or as a take down of an evil tyrant (i.e. Martin Scorsese's The Wolf of Wall Street), though it tries for both at different points. It doesn't work as a revelation, as most anything it has to say is well-known or easily researched with a quick Google trip. It doesn't work cinematically, parading around busyness as style. It doesn't work comedically, unless it's ripping off Big Short. And it doesn't work as a display of acting feats, everyone doing SNL-esque impressions in lieu of character work.\nMcKay seems to be turning into a narrative-focused version of Michael Moore, only without the conviction. Vice is the worst form of political choir-preaching: an infuriating amount of false equivalencies and self-righteous propaganda that only serves to rile up both sides of aisle, offering little except, \"Conservatism bad; liberal good.\" Regardless of your politics, you deserve better than that.",

            "review_title": "Shockingly Bad Dick Cheney Biopic/Mockumentary",
            "content": "I was really looking forward to this movie for a long time and for a variety of reasons, despite my aversion to Dick Cheney and his policies. I love the cast as well as satire/dark humor, and loved \"The Big Short\" (which I saw in theaters in 2015 and rated a 9 out of 10.) A dark satire about an unpopular and infamous vice president was always going to be a difficult task to pull off, but I was not expecting anything near the startling failure that this film turned out to be. I genuinely can't believe that this film turned out to be such a mess.First and foremost, the editing in the film is simply horrendous. I understand that McKay wanted to do this film in an unconventional style, which I normally would support given that the conventional tropes of the biopic genre have grown stale and old. However, the film's juxtaposition of quick cuts is too jarring for even the most seasoned viewers to keep straight. Sometimes the use of quick cuts is necessary (i.e. war footage,) but other times it is questionable (repeated analogous or symbolic references) or completely ridiculous. The film's perceived self-awareness is all over the place, trying to make itself seem more comedic and dumbed down at times, as if the viewer needed to be punished, and its often-bizarre narration is just silly. The acting tends to weirdly alternate between being overdone and undercooked--which is truly puzzling given the film's outstanding cast.Also, McKay failed to understand this time how to deliver stark political commentary without seeming schlocky or over-the-top (a la Michael Moore and Oliver Stone.) Speaking of Moore and Stone, the film is essentially a love child of both of their filmographies--and that's not always a good thing. The reason is because the film seems to not always be concerned with proper presentation of facts. I'm a lifelong Democrat and no fan of Cheney myself, and while much of the film is likely accurate, some of it probably is not (which the film seems to inadvertently acknowledge as it commences) or presented misleadingly. The bizarre editing also causes grave damage to the possibility that more viewers will see the film as credible. And while the film will certainly infuriate liberals, it not only offers no commentary on solutions on how to best move on from Cheney's (and now Trump's) worldview--it explicitly feels solely like preaching to the choir from beginning to end. While McKay rightly criticizes Fox News in the film for its use of schlocky, highly biased and opinionated information, he fails to understand that sometimes his film feels like a liberal version of a Fox News broadcast rather than a more thorough and potent critique of Cheney. After the outstanding \"The Big Short,\" I'm truly puzzled that this film turned out this bad. 3/10",

            "review_title": "Director's informative portrait of former Vice President could have been more objective and less contemptuous",
            "content": "Vice is Adam McKay's part-satirical, part-dramatic meditation on our former Vice President, Dick Cheney. Vice turns out to be more like a docudrama, touching on all the main points of Cheney's life in a series of vignettes that often move back and forth in chronological time. Little of a three act structure, typical of most screenplays, can be discerned here.\nEarly on McKay cannot disguise his contempt for his subject. After Cheney's second DUI, McKay's narrator (Cheney's subsequent heart donor voiced by Jesse Plemons) intones that in \"modern day parlance,\" our eventual Vice President would be labeled as a \"dirt bag.\"\nNonetheless McKay performs an excellent service in outlining Cheney's life before becoming Vice President. To confess, all I knew about Cheney besides his being Vice President, was that he was formerly the CEO of the Haliburton Corporation. I had no idea that he was Donald Rumsfeld's assistant in the Nixon White House, Chief of Staff to President Ford, a member of the House of Representatives for ten years in the 80s, and Secretary of Defense under President George H.W. Bush.\nMuch of Vice rises and falls on the actors McKay has chosen to play real-life personages. Christian Bale is a dead ringer for Cheney, not only in his appearance but voice as well. Some critics have complained that Bale's Cheney is simply an \"impression\"-but let's be real: Cheney was not the most charismatic politician in American history so one should not expect a great deal of eye-popping histrionics from Mr. Bale.\nAmy Adams captures Lynne Cheney's unbridled ambition nicely as the devoted wife who really is the bedrock to a man whose heart problems periodically stifle his upward trajectory. Lynne's steeliness is first on display when she demands that Dick clean up his act following his arrest for DWI. Later when their daughter Mary reveals she's gay, she's more concerned with how this will impact her husband's career than displaying sympathy and affection for her daughter. And finally, she proves to be much more socially engaging than her husband when she campaigns for him while he's laid up in the hospital after another one of his heart attacks.\nLess compelling is Steve Carell as Donald Rumsfeld. Carell plays Rumsfeld more as an aggressive and crude boor than the man Henry Kissinger termed the most \"ruthless\" man he ever met. Bill Camp doesn't look at all like President Ford but LisaGay Hamilton does as Condoleezza Rice-unfortunately she has nothing to do. Tyler Perry looks slightly like Colin Powell but is unable to capture his essence. The same goes for John Hillner, who bears a passing resemblance to George Bush Sr., but is unable to convey the charm.\nMuch more successful is Sam Rockwell as President George W. Bush. Perhaps the best scene in the film is when Bush meets with Cheney and offers him the Vice Presidential spot. Rockwell portrays Bush as quite likable, content to delegate power to others who are far more capable than he in performing governmental duties.\nIt's McKay's thesis that once Cheney became Vice President he virtually ran the show in the Bush II White House. In fact the opening scene in the film focuses on Cheney's famous order on 9/11 authorizing the military to shoot any plane down without direct authorization from the president. There is a great deal of time spent discussing the \"Unitary Executive Theory,\" a theory of American constitutional law holding that the President possesses the power to control the entire executive branch. These academic sequences tend to slow the narrative down considerably.\nIf a Second Act crisis can be discerned at all, that would be the imbroglio over the US decision to invade Iraq. McKay holds Cheney primarily responsible for the invasion as well as the subsequent outcome: the deaths of many American soldiers and the chaos that followed, including the rise of ISIS.\nWhile clips of President Carter and Reagan are utilized, we never see Bush Sr. during the years he was actually in office. Hence a positive period in Cheney's career is passed over-he's given no credit as Secretary of Defense, when there was a successful outcome to the first Iraqi War.\nWorse yet is McKay's failure to highlight Hillary Clinton's decision to support the second Iraq War. The fact is that many Democrats joined the Republicans in authorizing the war not only because Saddam was dangerous having used poison gas against his own people but because they truly believed Saddam was in a position to obtain weapons of mass destruction. It was actually Saddam who promulgated the false notion that he had nuclear bombs. Call it a failure of intelligence to actually figure out whether Saddam was telling the truth or not, but in reality obtaining hard core information from closed, authoritarian societies has always proved problematic.\nSo arguing that Cheney was primarily responsible for the second Iraq War, without acknowledging there would have been no war without Democrat approval, proves to be a bit of a specious argument. The flippant way in which McKay mocks Cheney for his coronary difficulties is another example of his holier than thou attitude. On the other hand, McKay does have a measure of sympathy for the man on occasion-especially in his acceptance of his daughter's sexuality.\nI liked how McKay sums it all up when he has Cheney directly address the audience at film's end. The man is unapologetic-and that's exactly the way he is. McKay sees a Machiavellian character here but it appears both options-to invade or not to invade Iraq-at the time, were no-win propositions.",

            "content": "By an strange coincidence, the morning after seeing this film, I heard on BBC Radio 4 a snippet of the farewell speech of President Dwight D. Eisenhower in 1961. I thought there was no sound-bite summed up the film better than this: \"In the councils of government, we must guard against the acquisition of unwarranted influence, whether sought or unsought, by the military-industrial complex. The potential for the disastrous rise of misplaced power exists and will persist\".\"Vice\" tells the 'true story' - well... they 'tried their ****ing best' (LOL) - of the quiet man behind the throne, Dick Cheney (Christian Bale). Featuring flash-backs and flash-forwards at random, we trace the career of the Wyoming Yale drop-out from the early 60's through to his rise to power and then his graceful retirement, where he went on to run 'Iron Man' races and breed award-winning Golden Retrievers. (Important note: If you are a character that bolts for the door at the first sight of an end-title.... resist!).It's a film about infuriating Republicans (n) and a film that's no doubt infuriating (v) many Republicans. Other than an infamous hunting incident I knew nothing about Cheney.... and, to be honest, I'm still not sure I'm much the wiser. For this is a film by Adam McKay, who made \"The Big Short\" and the 'facts' presented to you by the narrative - in the same manner as the 'facts' presented in Michael Moore's documentaries - perhaps need to be taken with more than a little pinch of salt. (I did see an interview though where McKay said that all his \"facts\" had been \"fact-checked\". But this might be fake news!)It begs the question with me as to whether the film has been funded as a pro-Democratic piece of mischief. By the way, there is a nice 'mid-credit' scene mocking the \"liberal-bias\" in the film that is worth staying for.If you remember \"The Big Short\" then you will no doubt remember McKay's anarchic film-making style. This is very like that film, but without all of the celebrity pieces to camera (and I personally missed Margot Robbie in that bubble bath). This mockumentary style is, in the main, wildly entertaining but occasionally crosses over the line into 'rather annoying' territory. In trying hard to make an entertaining biopic about someone who, in many ways, was a pretty dull and grey politician, McKay occasionally goes over-the-top and the script become pretentious. (A Shakespearean sonnet was one such moment for me).There are some absolutely jaw-dropping assertions made by the film that - if I was an American - would make this a squirm-inducing movie to watch. The picture paints a dark and disturbing picture. If I had a parent or spouse that lost their life to the Iraq war in pursuit of those imaginary 'Weapons of Mass Destruction\", I would be distraught by the movie's assertions. Is this historical fact? It seems truly unbelievable and downright criminal if so.Christian Bale justly deserves award-nominations for his portrayal of Cheney. The man is an acting-machine and the physical transformation from the young stocky 60's lineman to the stooped and overweight elderly gent is staggering.\nSupporting Bale is a strong supporting cast, led by Amy Adams as Dick's assertive, opinionated and clever wife Lynne. Adams also ages extremely well in the film, and it's another standout performance from her. The sense is always there, from glances and moods rather than overtly in the script, that this is very much a partnership towards a goal (an \"axis of evil\" if you will!).Carell gets better and better in every film. His Rumsfeld feels like an intelligent impersonation of the leader, and interactions with others in the cast (such as Tyler Perry as Colin Powell) feel genuine and passionate.And is there a bad film that Rockwell has been in? His portrayal of the 'Bush boy' least-likely-to-lead is also uncanny. He's painted, probably accurately, as a puppet in the hands of Cheney, the great manipulator.The film is narrated by the excellent Jesse Plemons as an every-man who ends up with a close relationship with Cheney, as we find out later in the film (something I didn't for a minute see coming).Eddie Marsan - one of my favourite actors - also pops up, as does an uncredited Alfred Molina in a funny, but disturbing cameo role.If you liked McKay's \"The Big Short\" then I think you will enjoy this one. Conversely, if you were irritated by the quirky directorial style of that film then this one will also drive you to distraction. A few people I saw walk out of the showing: it just wasn't for them. As a UK15-rated film, there are also \"disturbing scenes\" (as the BBFC describes them), mostly in the form of inter-cut news footage of 9/11 and other terrorist incidents, and infamous US torture tactics that still remain shocking to this day. (One of the worst of these for me featured the close-to-home Piccadilly tube bombings in 2005.) The editing also deliberately cuts from very quiet scenes to EXTREMELY LOUD military explosions that made me often jump out of my skin: so perhaps not for the overly nervous cinema-goer!But this is one of the most thought-provoking films that I am likely to see this year, and I was fascinated from beginning to (final) end.(For the full graphical review, please check out One Mann's Movies on the web or Facebook.

            "content": "Engaging Look at a Controversial Politician\nDick Cheney is such a controversial politician and he has been linked to some of the most controversial political events of at least the last twenty years, it is probably impossible to make a movie that will satisfy every political persuasion. For this reason the movie should be judged on its own movie-making techniques. In this respect Vice deserves a \"Five-Star\" rating. This is movie watching at its best.McKay has employed some inventive movie-making to produce a fine film. There are certainly a lot of flash-backs and flash-forwards employed to explain the events in Cheney's life. But he has made effective use in breaking the Fourth Wall between the audience and the movie characters. There are several on-going dialogues happening in this film, most of which are from Cheney himself. He allows the inner-most thoughts of these characters determine the depiction of the action in the film, so sometimes you, the viewer, are not immediately sure what is really doing on in the scene. Highly inventive directing and a smart script.The main actors have most of all captured the essence of the character they are playing. Sam Rockwell as President George W. Bush, Amy Adams as Liz Cheney, Steve Carell as Donald Rumsfeld, and of course, Christian Bale as Dick Cheney, have all morphed into their characters, so much so it is ungodly.The movie is described as a mock-documentary. While it certainly has elements of a documentary or mock-documentary, it is mostly a character study of Cheney and the people around him. McKay's movie will do this: It will move back and forth between documentary, mock-documentary character study and straight narrative and back again to try to unlock the mind, as much as humanly possible, the mind of Dick Cheney.The movie dramatically illustrates there will never be any political agreement on the legacy of Dick Cheney. The subtext of this movie is that in Dick Cheney's political world there is no Liberal or Conservative, but simply the Exercise of Power. If anything, the skilled movie making of McKay has added to the ambiguity of that legacy, and to the oblique, elusive, and ill-defined nature of Dick Cheney's character.",

It wears its heart on its sleeve.\nIf I described this film as a work of art and said that beauty is in the eye of the beholder then I think the film speaks fairly of Cheney. Cheney is provided a monologue directly into the camera toward the end that justifies what he did in his own mind. There would surely be those in the audience that, like Cheney - without making a big fuss, saw no issue with a man dealing harshly with a harsh world. These folk would appreciate that Cheney saw himself as a man carrying out his duty. MINOR SPOILER: The chap who fell from the electrical pole and busted his leg badly gets no less sympathy from Cheney than any other member of the work crew. That didn't paint Cheney out to be particularly mean-spirited but instead a realist. END SPOILER.\nThe comedic elements in the movie was a director's choice based on the saying, \"If you didn't laugh you'd cry.\" It was a choice to make either a terribly serious movie or to make a film that reflects how ridiculous reality is at times. I mean, Trump, love him or hate him, has made the presentation of the role of POTUS something you could only dream up in a film, yet it is 100% real. The ridiculous things that happened under Cheney and Bush as per the film are no less incredulous than the downfall of Bill Clinton. What made life exceptionally bizarre during the Bush Jr era were the nightmarish attacks on the World Trade Center (and Pentagon). That event itself was so unthinkable yet it did occur in reality. How does one deal with that? I mean, really??\nIf an entire nation could suffer from PTSD from a single event, that would be it.\nI'm endeavouring to not be Liberal or Conservative in my reviewing this movie but I'm certain everyone reading this review will think I'm leaning too much one way.\nTo summarise, I believe Adam McKay was trying to create a piece of art that would let the audience decide right from wrong should they feel such a compulsion.\nThe fact that the movie has dark humour and surreal elements is only a reflection of the director's way of processing the fantastical events in the narrative. The saying 'You wouldn't believe it if it weren't true' comes to mind.\nIf Cheney were to make a movie about himself would it be different? Hell, yeah. It would more clearly spell out in his own mind why he did such things. From my perspective, Cheney's motivations were clear and they were hardly original.\nTop performances all round although Bale was bordering on 'mannered' and Carrell needed a more fully written character.\nWorth seeing on the big screen.",

The symbolism, metaphors, whatever, were so blatant and cheap, it seemed like amateur film making. Not a single thing bad is ever said or implied about any of the Democrats in the movie. Every Republican is portrayed as dumb or sinister. I love this director, but this was not his finest hour. He needs to be reined in for his next film and get back to business. I mean, so much of this movie really needed a second opinion because of all the randomly inserted clips that seemed to be nothing more than cheap shots. Worse yet, having grown up around the nineties and early 2000s, there's so much that the director/writer missed out on that ran up to the Iraq War and War on Terror. If you watched CNN and The History Channel, most of the programming during the day was devoted to Saddam and Osama Bin Laden. That's not a coincidence. This was in the planning for decades. Also, you could look at the map and see what the ultimate goal was in the War on Terror. Dick Cheney would have a good laugh at the Adam McKay for totally missing the forest from the trees. I mean, Hollywood did make a number of anti-Persian movies in the first decade or so of the 2000s including Troy, 300 and Argo. So much attention was paid to focus groups and how they supposedly manipulate public opinion but none towards the clear connection between the entertainment industry and the government's objectives? How do you overlook that?It would be one thing to make a movie like this about Republicans, but don't give the Democrats a total pass on everything. That completely ruins your credibility and objectivity. They are every bit as ruthless. Thankfully, I've seen both sides and will not let a movie like this influence me, but others didn't have that luxury like I did.",

            "review_title": "9/10 just for the mind blowing performances of Bale & Adams. Movie has its flaws & is very unusual, but it's a breath of fresh air in Hollywood.",
            "content": "Finally something else than boring, clich\u00e9 , uninspired & simply awful superhero movies full of people in masks punching each other & cheesy jokes (the only exception in the genre is of course Dark Knight Trilogy, simply a masterpiece, all 3 movies).''Vice'' is an artistic, very unconventional take on the times of Dick Cheney & Bush Junior and it will not be for everyone, but then again, whoever saw Big Short should expect unexpected. For me, this film is crossing the next boundaries in the cinema, a work that provokes deep reflection and I like it very much.That said, ''Vice'' has it's flaws. I would like to see a more linear narrative, because Bale gives a truly masterful performance here (Adams also) and I can only imagine what a masterpiece it could have been, if it was more classic perspective.But as for acting performances - my God, Bale is simply the most brilliant actor of his generation, period. Let me explain. Mannerism, occasional pauses when speaking, corners of his lips falling to one side, a completely different American accent than Bale usually uses and he nailed it and remember he is an Englishman! Also, Bale's natural voice is waaay deeper. Even the way he is holding his neck !! (producers talked in the interviews how they bought special machine for Bale, he used it to help him hold his neck just like Cheney). But this is not even the most important thing. The most important piece of this role, is mental structure and psychology, behind every gesture and gaze (McKay talks abt it in the interviews, go watch it) as it should be, this is not just an impersonation. Bale is powerful and terrifying figure, a man who once had rules, but starts to walk on corpses and on the other hand, he is still very human, he is a great father and an incredibly romantic husband. Bale showed it all with his acting and still watered it all with absurdity. If you still don't get it, go watch ''Actors on Actors'' series of interviews, with Tom Hanks and Viola Davis, this particular one. In this interview, Hanks and Davis - two brilliant actors with a lot of experience for sure - explain very well, that the real acting brilliance is when you could have better director or better script, yet still, by your acting alone, you make a role so good, and in this case, it's documentary-like, like you are watching real Cheney.They claim, that the most genius actors are those, who still shine & are the best thing even in a bad/not so great movies. And as a film school graduate, who already works a little in the industry, I can confirm, this is so true! Because filmmaking, even more than other fields, is a team effort and great director&screenwriter always helps an actor to achieve greatness in a given role, it is natural that good material in the screenplay / good director strengthens the actor's good sides and helps him to hide his weaknesses. McKay is on his way to be fascinating director, but he still struggles with storytelling, he is no Spielberg or Scorsese, yet Bale, even in movies with flaws, is simply wonderful, each time (he had few cases like this in his career, for example Harsh Times - its a flawed, not the best movie, yet Bale plays a veteran, street rudeboy/gangster type character ridiculously good).And this is exactly why, for me Bale is way above Di Caprio and always will be. Di Caprio has been hiding behind the genius of great directors, mainly Scorsese, since forever. From the beginning of his career, he took mainly projects of great directors (Cameron, Tarantino if he takes a break from Scorsese), he sits in a comfortable mainstream and doesn't challenge himself as an actor at all, doesn't go beyond a certain framework.Meanwhile, Bale, often chooses unobvious projects, \"dodgy\" as he himself put it, he said : '' I always like that. Whenever there's a project where everyone's going : Oooooh, it's a bit dodgy, I always like it. If you actually look at it, there tends not to be anything risky at all. Why did I start acting in the first place? I didn't do it to be mediocre or to please everybody all the time.'' - I find it one of the greatest quotes about acting. Bale challenges himself all the time, like when he made Flowers of War, again, most big A-list actors sit in their comfort zone - mainstream, big, Oscar - productions, where everything is given to them on a silver platter. Christian did the Flowers of War movie, even if he didn't speak any Chinese and the whole crew on the set didn't speak any English, there was only 1 translator - this is real challenge for an actor. Another example is American Psycho - when Leo was afraid of public lynching if he played someone as disgusting as Bateman, and that's why, apparently, he gave up this role. Besides, the original director (Mary) and the writer of the book (Ellis) always wanted Bale not Leo, only the studio wanted Leo, because he was so popular at that time (well, the director&the writer were right). Bale turned out to be insanely good in this twisted, dark comedy, he was not only creepy, but funny as hell, I have yet to see Di Caprio playing a true dark comedy and being great at it (because Wolf is not it, not real satire/dark comedy, and anyone who knows writing/filmmaking knows comedy is the most difficult genre, especially dark comedy).Again, I work in the movie business & I have been saying for a long time that Bale's acting is so subtle and at the same time so unusual in various films, depending on the role - sometimes very physical, sometimes more mental, but always, I would always call it ''intellectual acting'', because everything in his roles is brilliantly thought out. And that's why this is not acting for most average viewers, but for true connoisseurs of cinema art, a rare group. For example a well-known film critic Mark Harris, New York film critic, brilliantly described what Bale actually was doing in ''Vice'', he wrote : ''My VICE take for today: Christian Bale knows more than almost any actor about how to use elaborate makeup, padding, etc as a tool for acting rather than as a crutch that replaces it. IMHO it's a great performance with a deep and unusual interest in how Cheney lives in his body.''. Spot-on !! But to know that, you have to be a very good observer.So overall, ''Vice'' is worth it just because of Bale's performance and I hope he will win an Oscar, becuase Cooper's overrated, bland and very much in the background role ain't anything special.The second reason to see ''Vice'' is of course Amy Adams, she is also simply amazing. Lady Macbeth - like, infernal intelligence and fierceness, and at the same time a great love for a man, for whom, she sacrificed entirely her ambitions. I also hope this is not the last time we see Bale&Adams together, coz they have great chemistry and understanding on screen. It is already their thrid cooperation (after The Fighter, American Hustle) and they both simply outstanding.In conclusion, I'm a little bit mad at Adam Mackay, because he as director and screenwriter could have done better job, but I give the movie a 9, because of a brilliance of Bale & Adams. Go watch it yourself !",

It is getting straight 6 star reviews on IMDB and RT and Metacritic. It will get awards because the acting is good. The writer and director did OTHER GUYS and BIG SHORT -- also not funny. It blames Dick for all evils with such ridiculous lies as FOX news started as a government funded idea and the first 24 hour news station (CNN was in 1980 while FOX didn't come until 1996).

            "content": "Adam McKay's follow up to his Academy Award winning, The Big Short is just as good, or maybe even better in my opinion that it's predecessor and again in sharp and attacking form with a good dose of comedy as well as material that will make you think and even unsettle you, it definitely is a film that is bound to be debated, discussed and the topic of water cooler conversations for anyone living in America, or who has even the tiniest bit of interest in political activities. Last time, McKay tackled the crash of the stock market along with the housing bubble and decline that is just over ten years ago that these events happened and with The Big Short, McKay took a subject matter that to many people would work better than a warm glass of milk at bedtime to put you asleep and instead totally energized the topic by making it understandable as well as also funny and entertaining in what was a marvellously edited and written film that made for good comedy as well as giving insight to one of the most polarizing news items of the last couple of decades. Here again, McKay takes on another topic and figure in American news that is at times funny, full of great editing, but also to anyone not normally engaged into the poltical world, he takes the persona of Vice President Dick Cheney and gives what is anything, but typical biography as well as doing it's own finger wagging at some of the morals and ethics behind some of his biggest decisions while in power. It could very well be argued as the film satirizes during it's closing credits that this is a film because of it's look into the subject as well as often scrutininizing and shaming some of the events of Cheney's life, that this is merely a liberal's point of view on the subject matter and therefore that this film is biased in it's approach. If you look on a conservative news site such as Breitbart News, the reviewer for this film (who's name at the moment, unfortunately escapes me) alluded to as much and more or less said that the number of Golden Globe nominations this film received, which was more than any other nominee this year, was because of the liberal Hollywood bias and because the film is shaming and calling out the Bush presidency as well as particularly Cheney himself in a not so flattering light, that Hollwood liberals would eat the film up and nominate it for whatever they could. It raises a valid argument because as much as I personally loved the film, there were many critics both liberal and not who were mostly lukewarm with the overall reception of the film. Review aggregate websites mostly had this film in the mid to high 60 percent range which is perhaps not good enough to warrant a nominee let alone be the sole recipient of the most nominees of said year. However the same case could be made for the other recent film, Bohemian Rhapsody, which had lukewarm to mediocre reviews from critics and yet audiences say it is one of the best films of the year and it even garnered some Golden Globe nominations too. Having seen my fair share of liberal and conservative news, I would say that this film does fall into the former category which will tend to perhaps turn off conservative viewers, or fans of Cheney, but I think going into this film I was prepared to take what they gave me not only with just a dose of salt, but also the whole shaker full of it. It is so common these days to have views done in a liberal, or politically correct way that perhaps sadly I have just become more accustomed to it even if I don't always necessarily agree with it. Still, I would consider this among the year's best for not just the brilliant acting, writing and editing (which in my opinion is all awards worthy), but also because no matter how you feel about this subject, or person, there is a lot that is brought up here that should offend people with the sense of morals and decency and the basic principle of right and wrong. Probably a lot of what Cheney did was ruthless and going behind the rules and laws that would have prevented such things. This is a film that as I mentioned earlier does give one a lot of food for thought and it can be a very aggressive film at times and can really hammer home it's message till it's litterally beating you over the head with it, but this is an opinion and a journey I was pleased to take to hear another side of the story, to think about it and be swept in at the great talent that was unfolding before me. This may not be for all tastes, but for those who want to think and savour what they have just watched you could do far worse than what proves to be one of this year's best films.",

            "content": "Cavils have been raised against this film. There may be some factual errors (e.g. Richard Armitage, not Libby, leaked Valerie Plame Wilson's secret agency). Inadequate attention is paid to what most dramatically distinguishes Dick Cheney from Donald Trump: Cheney's insistence on expanding American influence abroad, not abandoning it.\nBut this is a movie. It's not a biographic essay or a character analysis. It's a story that uses the historic particulars of Cheney to reveal a truth beyond his specifics.\nSo the title is not Vice-President Cheney. Its focus narrows to Vice. That can be read at least three ways. One, it abbreviates the title only to enlarge the character's role. It excludes \"president,\" as Cheney elbowed George Bush out of key presidential authority (military, energy, foreign policy) as a condition of becoming his running mate.\nThe title also refers to the vice-like grip that Cheney thus put on American government, especially by promoting the argument that the president stands above the law. As Nixon argued wistfully and Trump insists urgently, If the president does something, whatever it is, however illegal, it can't be considered illegal because the president did it.\nThird - and here the film shows its political point - that argument is a vice, a crime, a sin or weakness, because it flies in the face of the US constitution which the Founding Fathers developed to escape regal tyranny not to create one. That is the film's key thrust and clarion call to current concern about the American government.\nAt several points writer/director Adam McKay dramatically reminds us that he is not passively recording a reality but purposefully telling us a story.\nHe reminds us the film is a film. Thus he runs end-credits in the middle, as if Cheney's story/life (and the film) stops at his retreat from politics into Haliburton.\nEven more dramatic, his Dick and Lynne perform a Shakespearean, indeed Macbethean, dialogue on a married couple's lust for power. This right after the film's narrator has said he/we have no way of knowing what the Cheneys were thinking and saying between themselves at the time. This openly privileges story over history. It reminds us we're watching a constructed story not real life.\nThat's also the point of the later interruption of the real end-credits. A focus group breaks into a fight over the political bias of this film. These are the facts, one man insists, only to be rejected as a libtard by the Trumpist. By definition, both are right. The key point is that here McKay states that he is telling the Cheney story to express his own current political perspective.\nThat also explains Kurt, the narrative voice the film uses and occasionally shows. He's a veteran of the Afghanistan war, now living a working class life in Cheney's America. He's the victim of the Haliburton government. Not till the end is he identified -the man whose heart is transplanted to save Cheney's life.\nSpeaking from the grave - as the Founding Fathers do if we respect the Constitution - Kurt is hurt that Cheney refers to Kurt's heart as his own. Cheney doesn't respect this donor any more than he respects the workers and soldiers, always preferring the Haliburton class. Denying the heart of the American constitution - as Cheney here and Trump outside do - betrays an absolute lack of heart in considering the rights and liberties America's founding vision promised.",

There are plenty out there that he could use to deride Trump, but it's easier to forward some facile, childish message instead.I agree in sentiment with everything my father posts, but I'm considering blocking him because I'm sick and tired of post after post after post about how awful Trump is. I KNOW how awful Trump is, and I don't need a daily reminder (I have Trump himself as my daily reminder), especially when nothing new is being said.\"Vice\" is like the movie equivalent of my father's Facebook feed. I pretty much loathed Dick Cheney and Bush's entire administration when they were in office, so you'd think I would be the perfect audience for this movie, which is pretty much a two-hour smear campaign of Cheney and his associates. But instead, I found myself annoyed beyond measure by Adam McKay's obnoxious movie, which recreates the feeling of being trapped in a room with someone the day after the person he voted for didn't win the presidential election.Christian Bale, Amy Adams, Sam Rockwell and the rest of the cast try valiantly to do something with the material they are given, but they get buried in a mound of McKay petulance. This is a film without nuance, without subtlety, and without any real interest in exploring the dynamics of Cheney the man or of the Bush White House. This is a film where a character we're supposed to hate says something evil, and the camera cuts to a group of his cronies literally cackling like a cabal of witches. At the end, an alarmist montage seems to be implying that Cheney is single-handedly responsible for every bad thing happening today on Earth. Terrorism? Cheney's fault. Tsunamis? Cheney's fault. Indigestion? Cheney's fault. Let's not give the man too much credit, ok?And one of McKay's worst decisions is to have the film narrated by the man who served as Cheney's heart donor. This man, who speaks directly to the camera in one of McKay's most annoying directorial tics, apologizes to us for keeping Cheney alive. I hope that man's family doesn't see this movie, because that tacky and insensitive sentiment is a slap in the face to them and the loved one they're probably grieving for.Mostly, \"Vice\" is hopelessly irrelevant, despite McKay's determination to make us believe that Cheney is a demon from Hell hovering over all of us and planning our painful deaths. Why do we get a movie about this now? I lived through this, and guess what?.....I've moved on to being outraged by a whole new administration, one that's much worse. I never thought I'd be saying this but I'd welcome back Bush and his cronies as a substitute for what we've got now.I'm flabbergasted that this movie keeps getting so much serious awards attention. I have to believe it's only because its tone of liberal outrage resonates with Hollywood.Grade: D",

            "content": "Vice is a biopic based on the life of former US Vice President Dick Cheney directed by Adam McKay (Anchorman, The Big Short). Starring Christian Bale in the lead role, it is an unconventional look into the behind the scenes role of a man considered to be one of the most powerful politicians in recent history.After joining the Republican Party in 1969, Dick Cheney (Christian Bale) quickly gains a reputation for his crafty political tactics and steadily climbs his way up the ranks to become a respected figure among his fellow politicians. Despite several health issues involving his heart, Cheney is eventually elected to Congress in 1978 thanks in part to his supportive wife Lynne (Amy Adams) running on his behalf. At the beginning of the new millennium, the Republican Presidential candidate George W. Bush (Sam Rockwell) selects Cheney as his running mate, due to his decades of political experience and two end up winning the 2000 election. One year later, in the aftermath of the 9/11 attacks, Cheney, along with Secretary of Defence Donald Rumsfeld (Steve Carell), oversee plans for the US to invade Afghanistan and Iraq.While its unorthodox approach to the source material may prove off-putting to some viewers, Vice still has plenty of memorable and clever moments to hold one's attention, thanks mainly to Christian Bale's mesmerising performance as the titular Vice President. The way in which Bale chooses to play Cheney almost echoes his portrayal of Patrick Bateman in American Psycho, in that he is shown to be a cold and calculating psychopath manipulating others to get what he wants. Unfortunately, the rest of the film does not always juggle its comedic and dramatic tone that well, often becoming hit-and-miss with its comic relief. This can get distracting at times and does end up weighing the movie down and prevent it from being classically satirical. At the same time though, Vice remains an interesting look into the pursuit of not necessarily \"absolute power\", but instead as an assistant to \"absolute power\", which is still power nonetheless.I rate it 7/10",

In the highly-entertaining and informative docudrama Vice, Dick Cheney (Christian Bale) becomes the most powerful vice president in the history of the US presidency. As writer/director Adam McKay plays it, some humor applies because Bush's childlike persona evokes smiles even in dire circumstances such as the invasion of Iraq.In its documentary element, Vice is an accurate history of the surprising rise of both Cheney and Bush, but the story is Cheney's. From his drunken early days to his sobering by wife Lynne, Cheney is nothing if not an adaptor with a highly-developed big-picture ambition, a politician who can see the gift that 9/11 gave to those like himself with global ambitions. Bale's impersonation of Cheney is stunning in both physical transformation and personality heft, an imitation that carries the personal stamp of an outsize personality.In the personal element, Amy Adams's Lynne is just as smart and adaptable as I remember, a force behind her husband in a time when women could gain power mostly through their husbands. Lynne would publish books on American history and weigh in at pillow-talk time with sage reactions to Dick's challenges.Crisply photographed and edited, McKay's story is immensely aided by an occasional tongue in cheek. Like our current time, if some governmental actions seem absurd, they are. When Vice runs credits midway, our confusion is alleviated when the story shows Cheney accepting an offer to visit the White House to discuss the vice presidency. In other words, his political life is by no means over.Admittedly, at times the film moves too fast over history, lacking depth other docudramas embrace. The audience might have been better with more interaction between Cheney and Bush. Such good acting, when the chemistry is there, should be expanded:Dick Cheney: \"I believe... we can make this work.\"\nGeorge W. Bush: \"Hehehe!\"To teach and delight is a worthwhile motto for any filmmaker. Adam McKay fulfills that promise.",

It's at this point when we can reevaluate the actions and results of those involved. One might call this the benefit of hindsight, but philosopher George Santayana is credited with saying \"Those who cannot remember the past are condemned to repeat it.\" Filmmaker Adam McKay has moved on from his sophomoric comedies (STEP BROTHERS, ANCHORMAN: THE LEGEND OF RON BURGANDY) to full bore political satire, first with his \"Funny or Die\" videos (co-produced with Will Ferrell), then to his searing look at the financial crisis of the mortgage market with THE BIG SHORT (for which he won an Oscar for adapted screenplay), and now to the power dynamics within the Bush-Cheney administration ... and how a quiet, unassuming insider became the most powerful man in America.In one of the biggest casting head-scratchers of all-time, Christian Bale takes on the role of Dick Cheney. We are barely one scene in before all doubts are assuaged, and we are reminded yet again why Mr. Bale is one of the most talented and fascinating actors in cinematic history. With the weight gain, the hair, the growling voice (not unlike Bale's Batman), the asymmetrical smirk - Bale becomes Cheney on screen and that allows us to focus on the manner in which filmmaker McKay unfolds the events - many of which we remember, even if we were blissfully unaware of the backstory.Cheney is first seen in 1963 Wyoming as a drunk and somewhat rowdy youngster. The film then bounces the timeline to key events such as Cheney's time as Donald Rumsfeld's (Steve Carell) intern/lackey and the 1970's (Bethesda, his being named youngest White House Chief of Staff, Ford's loss to Carter, and the campaign for Wyoming Congressman). Cheney's wife Lynne (played by Amy Adams) is portrayed as more ambitious than her husband (at least early on), and in one searing scene, yanks a young Cheney out of his funk and onto the upwardly mobile track. Were the timing 15 years forward, it's not difficult to imagine Lynne as the rising political star.The story really gets interesting once George HW Bush is elected and Cheney is brought back to D.C. as Secretary of Defense. From this point on, his near subversive quest for power is in overdrive. There are many quotes cautioning to 'beware the quiet man', and most fit the Cheney on display here. You've likely seen in the trailer where a finger-lickin' George W Bush (Sam Rockwell) chows on barbeque as he offers the VP job to Cheney. Surprisingly, this is one of only two scenes where McKay makes Bush look like a buffoon. If you haven't figured it out by now, it should be clear that McKay is not one to give the benefit of the doubt here ... his mission is to highlight all ludicrous actions of our nation's leaders during this time.Supporting work is provided by a deep cast including Lilly Rabe and Allison Pill as the Cheney daughters (Liz and Mary), Justin Kirk as Scooter Libby, Bill Camp as Gerald Ford, LisaGay Hamilton as Condoleezza Rice, Tyler Perry as Colin Powell, Eddie Marsan as Paul Wolfowitz, and Don McManus as David Addington. There is also Bob Stephenson as Rush Limbaugh, cameos from Naomi Watts and Alfred Molina, and Jesse Plemons as the narrator whose true role is held at bay until near the film's end.September 11, 2001 brings on a very interesting segment when there is an emergency White House evacuation, and Cheney is whisked into a secure room and appears to overstep his authority ... at least that's how it appears to everyone other than Cheney. He is described as having power \"like a ghost\", and it's this scene and the follow-up discussions about Afghanistan, that McKay believes best exemplifies Cheney's lust for power, and how 'right and wrong' are secondary to him.Actual clips of Nixon, Reagan, bin Laden, Carter, and Obama are dropped into segments providing a quasi-documentary feel at times. Cheney's heart issues, the political quandary resulting from his daughter coming out as gay, and the involvement of Americans for Tax Reform (ATR) and the Koch brothers all play a role here, as does the Unitary Executive Theory and the legal specifics that cause much debate. Also on display is some of the least complementary eyeglass fashion across 3 decades.Even though his approach leans pretty far left, filmmaker McKay is to be applauded for a most entertaining look at how our government officials can manipulate policy and public statements, and may even stoop to focus groups in better understanding the views of the American people. Editor Hank Corwin (Oscar nominated for THE BIG SHORT) is a big part of maintaining the quick pace of the film, and the use of fishing as a metaphor somehow works. \"America\" from West Side Story is a fitting song to end the clever, funny and thought-provoking film and our look at the rare politician who amassed power while mostly avoiding the publicity that other politicians seek. Watch at your own risk - depending on your politics.",

            "content": "Ostensibly a biopic of former Vice President Dick Cheney, Adam McKay's Vice argues that he was actually the de facto President, with George W. Bush taking a back seat, particularly in the globally crucial years from 2001-2003. Very much a political satire in the vein of Juvenal and Jonathan Swift, or films such as Wag the Dog (1997) and The Second Civil War (1997), Vice eschews conventional narrative structure, breaks the fourth wall regularly, intercuts shots of fly-fishing and animals hunting into the middle of tense plot-heavy dialogue scenes, features several self-reflexive references to itself, has a false ending, and has a scene in which characters speak in iambic pentameter. Much as was the case with recent \"based on a true story\" films such as BlacKkKlansman (2018) and The Front Runner (2018), Vice has one eye on the here and now, using Cheney's story as a vehicle to examine the current political situation in the US, positing that without the power-mad Dick Cheney and the Unitary Executive Theory, there would never have been a Donald Trump. However, although there are many individual moments of brilliance, the film is unsure if it's a straightforward biopic or an excoriating satire, ultimately finding a kind of ideological middle ground that mixes comedy with pathos, not always successfully.Narrated by Kurt (Jesse Plemons), a fictitious veteran of the Afghanistan and Iraq Wars, who claims to have a unique connection to Cheney, the film begins in Wyoming in 1963 as a young Dick Cheney (Christian Bale) is arrested for drunk driving for the second time. It then cuts to the Presidential Emergency Operations Center in the immediate aftermath of 9/11, as Cheney orders the shooting down of any suspicious commercial airliners, despite Bush (who was en route to Washington from Florida) not signing off on such an order. How Cheney got from being a drunk in 1963 to taking control of the government in 2001 is the film's primary focus. Much as in BlacKkKlansman, Vice concludes with a haunting montage that brings the story up to date, showing some of the long-term effects of the Bush-Cheney years (instability in the Middle East, irreparable damage to the environment, the rise of IS).Vice presents Cheney as devoid of ideology, with a Zelig-esque ability to alter his manner so as to best deal with whomever it is in whose company he finds himself. In this sense, his political ambition is portrayed as cynical and mercenary; McKay's Cheney has no interest in attaining power so as to influence policy or stimulate ideological change, he is obsessed only with power-for-power's sake. One of the most telling scenes in the film happens quite early when he learns that Nixon and Kissinger are planning to bomb Cambodia without going through Congress. Asking Chief of Staff Donald Rumsfeld (Steve Carell), \"what do we believe?\", he is met by Rumsfeld laughing hysterically at being asked such a ridiculous question.Nowhere is his character shown as more ruthless and power-hungry than in a scene towards the end of the film. With his daughter, Liz (Lily Rabe), running for the Senate, a TV advert accuses her of \"aggressively promoting gay marriage\". Cheney's other daughter, Mary (Alison Pill), had been married to a woman for over a year at the time. The day after the advert aired, Liz appeared on Fox News Sunday and said she did not support gay marriage, causing a rift between the family and Mary which remains to this day. The film features a scene the night before Liz goes on TV, in which she asks permission to defend herself. In a chilling moment lifted right out of The Godfather Part II (1974), Cheney indicates his approval with a single silent nod of his head.As with The Big Short (2015), Vice is aesthetically audacious. For example, the film is edited in such a way as to remind me of Oliver Stone's \"horizontal editing\" in films such as JFK (1991), Nixon (1995), U Turn (1997), and, especially, Natural Born Killers (1994). It's no coincidence that Vice was cut by Hank Corwin, who cut several of Stone's 90s films. For example, as Chaney attempts to manipulate Bush (Sam Rockwell) into agreeing to give him more power, there are intercepts of fly-fishing. It's not subtle, but it is effective. Elsewhere, much as Stone uses Coke commercials and footage from old films in Natural Born Killers, Vice features excerpts from the Budweiser \"Whassup?\" commercial and Survivor (2000). In another scene, when Cheney first learns of the Unitary Executive Theory, the film cuts to a lion bringing down a gazelle. For me though, some of the most effective editing in the film is more conventional. One particularly strong example is as Bush declares war on Iraq, the camera tilts down to show his leg is shaking. The film then cuts to a shot of an Iraqi civilian's leg shaking as the bombs begin to drop.Also similar to The Big Short is the film's sense of humour, with a tone of irreverence established from the very beginning, as the opening legend states, \"the following is a true story. Or as true as it can be given that Dick Cheney is known as one of the most secretive leaders in recent history. But we did our f---king best.\" A particularly sardonic scene comes about an hour in, as the film shows Cheney turning down Bush when he asks him to be his running mate in 2000. At this point, the legend explains that Cheney had chosen family over politics, and that he happily lived out his days in Wyoming. As the Cheneys gather around a family barbeque, triumphant music swells, and the closing credits start to roll, only for the movie to interrupt itself, pointing out that that's not what happened. It's a very meta technique, and one which both mocks feel-good biopics, whilst also suggesting had Cheney not returned in 2000, the world could have had this happy ending.Another very funny sequence sees Cheney and his wife, Lynne (Amy Adams) in bed discussing whether or not he should accept Bush's offer, with the narrator explaining, \"Sadly there is no real way to know exactly what was going on with the Cheneys at this history-changing moment. We can't just snap into a Shakespearean soliloquy that dramatises every feeling and emotion. That's just not the way the world works.\" This is immediately followed by Cheney and Lynne speaking in faux-Shakespearean blank verse as they work themselves up into a sexual frenzy (although technically, this is a duologue, not a soliloquy). In another scene, a waiter (Alfred Molina), reads from a menu that features various forms of Cheney-endorsed torture. After listening to their options, Cheney gleefully declares, \"we'll take it all\". There is also a hilarious mid-credit scene, which sees a focus group descend into chaos when a conservative calls a liberal a \"libtard\", prompting a mass brawl, whilst two young girls ignore it so as to speculate about the new Fast & the Furious film.For all that, however, Vice isn't a patch on The Big Short, for a number of reasons. For example, whereas in The Big Short, the self-reflexive Tristram Shandy-style narrative structure worked to the film's advantage, providing a way into the complex story, here it has the exact opposite effect, oftentimes distracting from McKay's thematic concerns, preventing the film from focusing on telling us how (and why) Cheney exploited loopholes in executive power to restructure US foreign policy.The most egregious problem is that the film fails to give any kind of psychological verisimilitude or interiority to Cheney. Presenting him in an almost robotic manner, there is very little on what drives him, depicting his various deeds without offering anything cogent in terms of his motivations. Is he simply an ideologically-weak opportunist? Is he an evil megalomaniac fuelled by a deeper purpose, and if so, what purpose, and how? Could it all really have been about power, viewing the global geopolitical sphere as his own personal playground and nothing more? And if the film is arguing this, suggesting that this man, responsible for so much pain and suffering, did it all simply because he liked power, isn't that to downplay his agency, to allow one to argue that he didn't really know how much damage he was causing? Depriving him of psychology weakens any attempt to censure his actions. The film's Cheney is ultimately unknowable, and that makes his acts more easily forgivable. The argument that it was all because of power and greed really does next-to-nothing to help explain the man. It could, I suppose, be cited as an example of the banality of evil. Except that the film's Cheney is anything but banal. In fact, he's terrifying.Cheney pressured the CIA to find non-existent links between Al-Qaeda and Saddam Hussein so as to justify an illegal invasion of Iraq. He oversaw the public relations campaign to build popular support for the war. He encouraged the torture of terror suspects all the while denying it was torture. He was responsible for the worst strategic blunder in US history, the growth of a domestic surveillance state, the dictatorialisation of the office of the President, and the deaths of 4,000 American troops and at least 100,000 Iraqi civilians. Positing him as a man who was power-mad and little else, Vice remains always on the outside, trying to listen through the wall, never managing to open the door and expose his actual inner workings. The comedy and structural experimentation make it entertaining as a film, but it tells us very little about Cheney that we didn't already know. Strip away the artifice, and you'll find it doesn't have a huge amount to say. Never attaining the scale of tragedy to which it clearly aspires, the film functions instead to remind critics of Bush's cabinet why they became critics of Bush's cabinet. In the end, rather than exposing Cheney's dark soul, the film argues that he doesn't have one. And that is a far less interesting thesis.",

It will no doubt be compared to writer/director Adam McKay's film adaptation of The Big Short. But while that story covered just a couple years, Vice spans nearly 4 decades, significantly more difficult to fit into a 2 hour film.McKay's use of a narrating character is sometimes helpful in providing context and continuity, though I think it worked better in The Big Short.As a bio-pic, Vice does a good job of capturing Cheney's drive for power and his devotion to his family. Complicated people are generally difficult to depict in film, but McKay and the team he assembled gave it an effort worthy of some awards.I found some of the editing a bit quirky to the point of distraction, but I definitely recommend seeing it.

            "content": "This is a biopic of former American Vice President Dick Cheney (Christian Bale). Starting in 1963, he's a drunken punk. He gets kick out of Yale and his girlfriend Lynne (Amy Adams) gives him an ultimatum. He sets off for Washington and interns for congressman Donald Rumsfeld (Steve Carell). He gets elevated into the Nixon administration and with Ford. He wins the House seat for Wyoming. When his youngest daughter Mary comes out of the closet, his political career seems to be over. Then George W. Bush (Sam Rockwell) comes calling for him to be his VP pick.Writer/director Adam McKay is a Hollywood liberal and this movie has a deliberate liberal bend. If one dissects this movie from its style, there actually isn't anything too controversial other than Lynne's mother's death. Like the opening text says, this is the truth or as close to the truth considering how private the Cheneys are. It's the McKay style that is unnecessary. It pushes the material unnecessarily. The basic material is already politically slanted. The flash edits is akin to McKay yelling at the audience. It doesn't add comedy. It doesn't add spice to the story. It's just annoying. Dick is also not the most physically dynamic of characters although Christian Bale really disappears into the role. I am surprised that more isn't made of his Halliburton days. The one thing I did learn about is the Unitary executive theory. I knew about the concept and the execution. I just didn't know that it has a name.Finally, there is Jesse Plemons playing the mysterious Kurt as the narrator. The reveal is underwhelming. The big shocking emotional turn is how the Cheneys dealt with Mary. It is the most human of family drama in this political life. On the one hand, I'm giving McKay credit for not playing up Mary's turmoil since he has no inside information on that part of the story. On the other hand, Cheney's heart seems like trying too hard and failing at something poetic, and Mary's turmoil would be a more compelling button to his story. Overall, this McKay movie would work much better without the McKay style.",

            "content": "Adam McKay is in the midst of a career reinvigoration. Will Ferrell couldn't be further from the deadly serious satire of his newest effort Vice, a biopic charting the rise of Dick Cheney, attempting to account for the stupendous amount of power he managed to secure through shrewd. cloak and dagger bureaucratic tactics.\nTo play the portly and grunting Cheney, McKay has enlisted Christian Bale, who once again proves his deftness at changing his body for a role, here sporting a formidable gut. Bale is occasionally arresting as Cheney, his reserved head sways and deep throaty voice exuding a subtle magnetism that spearheads the tale, especially in a memorable fourth wall breaking scene towards the close of the film wherein he assures the audience of his moral integrity. The other main players are competent, as you'd expect from Oscar bait fare of this nature, but barely approach the degree of nuance Bale commands- Amy Adams as Lynne Cheney though proficient in her portrayal can feel slightly one note (which is more a reflection of a script which doesn't afford her very complex characterisation. Steve Carell and Sam Rockwell as Donald Rumsfeld and George W Bush, while entertaining and occasionally amusing, see the potential of great character actors somewhat squandered in favour of caricature.\nThis brings us to the main issue with Vice - a clumsy sense of brio with regards to tone and structure. McKay's feature is almost never boring, but no one would accuse it of subtlety or discipline, especially in comparison to McKay's far superior preceding effort The Big Short. Vice shares that film's kinetic, non-sequitur laden editing style, but is far less complimentary with the narrative at the film's core in Vice's case. The Big Short boasted an immediacy that Vice's decade spanning story can't hope to recreate, and by consequence, the insertion of absurdist humour and archival footage can compromise the actual narrative and render the film more than a little indulgent. It also seems slightly hypocritical; McKay's enthusiastic and hyperactive style is at odds with Vice's \"cradle to grave\" seemingly conventional biopic structure. While McKay swinging for the fences is occasionally chuckle inducing (the use of narrator in the film is inspired even if it feels laboured at times, and a scene in which the Cheneys recite Shakespearean soliloquys is deserving of recognition) it ultimately leaves Vice feeling far more scattershot and less nourishing as a narrative.\nEven so, Bale's entertaining performance and McKay's sardonic and gleefully nihilistic energy behind the camera ensures Vice is at the very least constantly diverting and unpredictable.",

Yeah, it's my latest review.Covering about forty years in the life and times of ex-vice president Dick Cheney, Vice vies with the Bush administration's take in 2008's W. and gives it a little more pizzazz (ironic seeing that a certain controversial helmer directed W.). In veracity, I had been readily waiting to see Vice on a traditional Christmas Day. Safe to say I wasn't disappointed.Released at 132 minutes with its narrator as veritable heart transplant donor and its end credits coming in rather prematurely (ha-ha we get it, slick Dick wasn't quite done with his anti-terrorize-r career yet), Vice gives Dick Cheney impressionist Christian Bale another chance to be his chameleon self. His method acting is in the stylings of Robert De Niro while his weight has fluctuated over the years like Oprah. With Vice, Christian becomes so unrecognizable and goes so far down the rabbit hole, you forget he's even in the darn flick. Put Bale's movie posters of 2004's The Machinist and The Fighter next to his yellowed poster for Vice. Come on, I dare you.Anyway, Vice has out of the box film-making, an uber-skimmed narrative, and a need to sometimes feel like a political, bullet point presentation (don't worry, it's still all good). The pic also announces director Adam McKay as the hottest thing going in Hollywood. Heck, if you let him grab you by the lapels and sweep you into his radical vision (without conventional judgement), Adam's Vice might just \"entice\" you.McKay as the brainy lovechild of early David O. Russell and 90's Oliver Stone, breaks a lot of cinematic rules here. He knows it. You know it. But hey, he doesn't really care. McKay infuses Vice with freeze frames, archive footage, reverie elements, bucked humor, and splashy editing. Granted, he sometimes wanes focus and skips the information superhighway (unlike in The Big Short) by showing more of the Chief of Staff positions Cheney held as opposed to what he actually did (this is only in the first hour or so). Still, Vice is commendable, outre oeuvre from Adam McKay. And it doesn't hurt that he gets great supporting work from Amy Adams, Tyler Perry, and Steve Carell (they play Lynne Cheney, Colin Powell, and Donald Rumsfeld respectively). Not as hate-filled or dour as some critics have rendered it to be, Vice might yield as one of this year's best. It gets a strong 3 star rating.",

I was excited to see this movie because they gave it a comedic route and also all of the actors and actresses in it. When the reviews came out they were very mixed, even getting a bad score by audiences on Rotten Tomatoes. Don't listen to those reviews, this is a pretty good movie. I thought it brought some great insight and new information to the story that was very interesting. Christian Bale was amazing as Dick Cheney. Bale won the Golden Globe this past Sunday for this role in the Best Actor Comedy/Musical category. He captured him perfectly and with the makeup he looked exactly like him. Amy Adams as Lynne Cheney was also really good. She was nominated for Best Supporting Actress and is a lock for the nominations for the Oscars. Though she probably won't win, she's my second choice. Adam McKay did very well writing and directing. His last movie, The Big Short, was also a big contender for the 2016 academy awards. He had an interesting approach to the movie giving it narration, which I'll get back to in a second, and making it very comedic with the editing style. The editing for his movies, done by Hank Corwin, is always so strange and unique. At the very beginning there were a few sentences on the screen saying how it was a true story but \"Dick Cheney is a secretive man\" and those sentences were the best opening lines of a movie I've seen in a while. There was an editing choice done halfway through the movie that I thought was hilarious. Usually a film has three acts to it, but it was more split into two big acts with three small ones within the two. That sounds confusing but it makes sense to me. The narration in the movie, done by Jesse Plemons, was good and had an interesting turn towards the end. I loved it and I think most will. The score for the film was good, as it made the shortlist for the Oscars. I loved the makeup and hairstyling, which probably will win the award. For problems I felt the split between acts was a little weird but that's because of the story since it didn't focus on him being Vice President till later. I thought it kind of slowed down more on the second half too. This isn't a big problem but the title sequence felt too late for me but not many will care about it. The movie was also a little bit long but there was a lot to get in. Overall I thought Vice was a much better film than what people said. A lot of negative reviews came from Republicans so if you fit that criteria I guess be warned if you get offended by these kinds of things. Since this was the film that scored the most Golden Globe nominations this year and you're into award winning movies, I would check this out.My Grade: A-",

Bale's portrayal of Cheney is excellent. Rockwell is excellent as Bush Jr. History should not be kind to either of these individuals.However, the movie bogs itself down in going well beyond a documentary and into pushing its own politics and revising history. As i've just watched a documentary of interviews with common people from 1929, I watch Adams' portrayal \"all women were oppressed\", it gnashes strongly against McKay's goal to be taken seriously as a documentary maker. McKay also takes liberties to only criticise some media outlets as Republican propaganda machines, when most of the media is Democrat propaganda (but McKay ignores the second scenario). Taking a shot at only Republican politicians, ignoring everything awful that was done by Democrats (eg. Bill Clinton's war mongering). Pretending that the only party who wants tax-cuts for the rich are the Republicans (but the Democrats forget to roll back these tax cuts when they're in power).What lets this documentary down is not the criticism of the WMD disaster, it's the absence of anything negative about Democrat destructiveness. It's the Amy Adams revisionist history for her own brand of politics.Thankfully, McKay already took care of that right at the end. Anyone that criticises a Democrat is a redneck. McKay must not be challenged.McKay is not a realist. He was superb at criticising the republicans. He was superb in casting Bale and Rockwell to paint some ugliness in a highly credible way. That's where the buck stops in this film. Too much of this movie borders on propaganda. You toe the party line or else. If it weren't for Bale and Rockwell, this movie would score 1 to 2.",

Adam McKay's Academy Award-winning \"Vice\" shows why we shouldn't. It focuses not on Bush, but on Cheney, showing how he went from loser to vice president, essentially reshaping the US government.A particularly effective scene is early on. Rumsfeld (Steve Carell) tells Cheney (Christian Bale) about Nixon's plans to start bombing Cambodia without congressional approval. He says it casually, revealing his lack of qualms. Almost immediately afterwards, Rumsfeld laughs when Cheney asks what the two of them believe; after all, their only belief is in power. No surprise that within three decades, they would be reshaping the globe in their image.Excellent movie, with support from Amy Adams (Lynne), Sam Rockwell (Dubya), Lily Rabe (Liz) and Alison Pill (Mary)",

Extremely uninteresting. Full of gimmicks like pretending to end the picture in the middle and running some final credits at that point. Or showing repeated closeups of a beating human heart that looks like a pile of raw liver. to underline the fact that the hero is undergoing a heart transplant. Pseudo documentary style with dates and description of events written on screen every ten minutes. But these inter-titles are more confusing than enlightening because the entire sequencing of the film is so jumbled and messy.The whole film with ragged time toggling back and forth is very confused, even when you are familiar with the events and the order in which they actually occurred. In Sum: I would have walked out halfway through if I hadn't been with friends. The private bedroom and bathroom life of the central couple, Amy Adams and Christian Bale, is more sickening than revealing of their private intimacy. Both are shown in badly lit full screen facial closeups over and over which emphasizes only their dullness. Almost the only memorable scene is when Bale does a full throat gargle with mouthwash in the bathroom while chatting with his wife. Arguably his most lively scene in the entire flick. This is supposed to be about a Vice president, Dick Cheney, who was so powerful that he relegated the president, George W. Bush, to the background in the wake of 9/11 when we are to believe that he took charge and plunged us into a series of dead-end wars. None of this potential power comes across from Bale's limp performance. He emanates weakness, not strength. The characters mulling around in the white house and other government offices got to be so dull that after a while it was a gigantic relief to see Richard Nixon in two brief closeups. His withdrawal from office speech on TV following Watergate actually brought the picture to life for a few seconds, which isn't saying much. One plus. Every scene that Sam Rockwell was in playing president George Bush was more or less watchable. The facial similarity was there and Rockwell played rings around Bale every time he was on. All in all an overweaning pretentious muddled mess that made me heave a sigh of relief when it finally did end after several phoney half baked endings. Much is made of Cheney's life long hobby of angle fishing and at the end we see a rather pretty sequence of colorful angling hooks and flies as if this were the secret key to Cheney's entire personality, like the Rosebud sled at the end of Citizen Kane. But Citizen Cheney is at least a light year away from Kane.\nimage1.jpegimage2.jpeg",

This film jumps at you throughout with explosions being amplified for the wars started to jolts here and there. It was well put together and kept the viewer engaged.Christian Bale does a great job in portraying Cheyney and living the role. He is very deserving of his golden globe. This is in many ways a very Liberal film as it takes quite a few hits at conservatives & portrays them as blunt objects. The end credit scene perfectly illustrated that while yes it was shown in a funny manner it was indeed factual. Yes not an opinion but cold hard facts. You cannot rewrite deaths or the cause of ISIL, enough said. The truthful parody of Cheyney and Bush shows how those with power escaped any accountability. A person copying a Harry Potter CD might go to jail but not these guys. This is also a polarizing film and about to trigger people so this film and this review could receive mixed ratings.8/10",

My advice to viewers is to watch and enjoy this movie and the performances of the actors, and not to get entangled in any type of political war - please note, the world works better for everyone when there is peace.First of all, Christian Bale as Dick Cheney is excellent - he is almost flawless in his performance. Amy Adams as Cheney's wife is also equally excellent in her performance.

I have to speak for myself, and it got to be less... Just less the longer it went on.Bale is magnetic, so is Adams who is channeling the same scary energy she had in The Master, Carrell is also a lot of fun, and there's some parts that are funny and startling and it manages to give us about 90% monster and 10% decent human being, which is kind of incredible. But by the end, like Oliver Stone's W (and McKay is channeling Stone far more than Stone did in that film), I wonder what is this person? What does he actually want? Is being a mediocre white man all that its about? Is it only power? Greed doesn't even see to be a big deal here for Cheney, who got rich as all get out from the Halliburton, nevermind the so-called war. So... What is it? The very end when Bale faces the audience may hold a clue(?) I don't know if smug is the word Id use for all of this, but glib is definitely it. And the style of The Big Short, even if it isn't pushed so far, doesn't work for it. It either needed to be full Strangelove (or better yet, the wild and erratic politics of The Favourite which is also out now), or maybe more traditional or focused.

            "review_title": "Snide Like Its Subject",
            "content": "The flaws of \"Vice,\" a satirical biographical picture of Vice President Dick Cheney, remind me somewhat of the problems with \"W.,\" the 2008 biopic of President George W. Bush. On the surface, both are left-wing critiques of their neo-conservative subjects; yet, they both end up identifying with the personalities of their characters in disquieting ways. In the case of Oliver Stone's earlier effort, the movie itself was as vacuous, if affable, as its portrayal of the 43rd President of the United States. Now, \"Vice\" depicts Cheney as snide and ruthless in his striving for power and profit, while he displays contempt for others. The movie itself shares a similar disdain for the intelligence of its audience as it snidely attacks the former Vice President and, at the same time, antagonizes the electorate that put him in office--i.e., many of the same people who comprise the audience paying to see \"Vice.\" Having left office with an approval rating of about 13%, one may assume that most people already disliked the man, especially if we acknowledge the role his uncharismatic personality, as well as the politics, plays in that disapproval. Likewise, I can't fully approve of \"Vice\" when it's similarly snide towards its viewers--treating them as so stupid that they must have their hands held as they are slowly and repeatedly walked through simple political concepts and recent history.A barrage of narrative techniques pound these points into our skulls: various narrators, either seen as characters or only as text, repetitive fourth-wall-breaking direct addresses to the spectator, a fake news personality mixed with real TV news footage, repetition of scenes and moments where we're literally asked whether we remembered something the movie said earlier (e.g. the unitary executive theory bit). Perhaps, the worst sequence--completing a running gag being made of his heart attacks--is of Cheney's heart replacement. It's as if the movie's heart stopped right along with him, with little other than a replaying of clips from prior scenes playing out ad nauseam during the procedure. It's as though we're supposed to be digesting the supposedly-challenging political lesson thus far presented. I could buy this sort of gimmickry in writer-director Adam McKay's prior \"The Big Short\" (2015), which dealt with the obscurity of credit default swaps, but there's nothing so difficult to understand in \"Vice.\" I'm sure most people, for instance, know exactly what FoxNews is and how it came to be.And if the heart replacement part isn't the worst offender here, it may, instead, be the after-credits scene, which obnoxiously tries to both compare its subject one last time with the current political situation of Trump's presidency and adds one last snipe at movie audiences with its reference to \"The Fast and the Furious\" franchise. It does this with no apparent sense of irony that after-credits scenes themselves owe their recent popularity to another mega movie franchise in the MCU. And any attempts here to link Cheney to Trump fall flat. Sure, we get it: there's the lying and disregard for democratic institutions, but even putting politics aside, including that Trump, like Obama, ran against the Iraq War and the Bush administration only to thus far partially continue much of the legacy of the War on Terror, the personalities of the two political characters are vastly different. Whereas Cheney may disregard the public's opinion, Trump is all about his brand. At least, Spike Lee understood that in his comparison of Trump to David Duke in \"BlacKKKlansman\" (2018), including by featuring Trump impersonator Alec Baldwin beginning the film by constructing Klan propaganda. \"Vice,\" on the other hand, devolves into a tit-for-tat in a focus group between a left and a right winger. One might just as well watch FoxNews if they want to see that.On the other hand, the acting is good, especially from Amy Adams and Christian Bale. I'm even amused by the irony that Bale is best known for playing Batman in a trilogy that some critics consider a not-so-thinly-veiled endorsement for neo-conservative policies in the War on Terror--what with a billionaire vigilante resorting to torturing criminals and spying on everyone's cell phones to combat the terrorism of the likes of Bane's Occupy Wall Street movement. Memorably, Bale even inflects his voice for both roles. Additionally, some of \"Vice\" is funny, and I like some of the style and the plot maneuvering between time periods. Most of all, it's something of an accomplishment just to have produced a biopic of such a detested public figure of recent events that's at least somewhat entertaining and refreshing in its synthesis of the subject.",

I never usually fall asleep at movies, yet I found myself struggling to stay awake with this one. Re-watching a \"Saturday Night Live\" sketch with Will Ferell and Darrel Hammond as Cheney and Bush would be more compelling than this film.The filmmaker obviously hates Cheney, and does not even try to humanize the man, unlike Oliver Stone did with \"W\" a few years back. I knew very little about Cheney's life before the vice presidency, and after seeing this film I don't know much more than before, nor do I have a greater understanding of what made this man take the actions he did. We only saw Cheney from the time he was in his late 20s, and never got a sense of his childhood or what may have set the foundation for his later life. It's not so much a biographical film as it is a chaotic film juxtaposed with some other random elements, including the film's irritating narration.Christian Bale is a talented actor, and unrecognizable through most of the film, so props to the makeup department there. However, he offers little depth to the man and you're left wondering why you should really even care about Cheney, or his legacy, especially if he really is just a total jerk as this film portrays him to be. Sam Rockwell does a good job with his portrayal of George W., but Amy Adams (who I've loved in other movies) is given very little to do as Lynne Cheney, who in reality is a very educated and interesting person in her own right.Regardless of how you vote, as a film goer, you deserve better than a film with such an obvious agenda against its subject.",

The events are interesting and help establish who he is but too much feels like padding. McKay's comedy doesn't quite land, the most prominent examples being the fake end credits and the Shakespeare style speeches.Then they get to him becoming vice president and the film takes off. The issues of the first half are quickly forgotten as the excellent acting finally has a worthy story. It's complex, fascinating and well written. The narration is more fitting, and the style that McKay has is used to better effect. Most importantly, this half has a story to tell.Overall, this film has some glaring issues but almost all of them are in the first half.

Adam McKay is a solid bringer of comedy films and then he brought something unique with The Big Short in 2015. I actually did not like that film and felt like the style and cuts in the conventional story telling was annoying for an already complicated subject matter. The similar type of story telling works with Vice. I actually am surprised at how much I liked this film.The film is a biopic of Dick Cheney. It shows the story of the former White House Chief of Staff and his eventual turn as the Vice President of the United States. Cheney was an extremely controversial figure and undoubtedly had a great amount of power for a Vice. The film portrays his launch of the war on Iraq after the events of September 11th. The film stars a fairly unrecognizable Christian Bale, Amy Adams, Steve Carell, and Sam Rockwell as W.First and foremost, Christian Bale is excellent in this. Almost unrecognizable and disappearing into the role of the soft speaking but demanding Cheney, he is as usual committed to the role. The makeup is great in this as Rockwell started to look more and more like George W. Bush as the film went on. It may not be completely accurate but I found it to be an entertaining look at Cheney. The narrative breaks and comedic elements work in this film because it adds brevity to a serious story.It will outrage you and you will draw parallels to the presidency of today, undoubtedly. I know a lot of people won't like this effort, but I truly feel like this is the strongest and most convincing thing I've seen from Adam McKay who is showing a real shine as a filmmaker who can come out of his element.

Bale perfectly captures look, nuance and voice while McKay fills in the dark shadows and provides us with visions of US war crimes against the timid souls of the earth by the likes of this American Darth Vader. Slicker and less sloppy than an Ollie Stone Presidential, anti-American slander it's comic and satiric possibilities collapses almost immediately from the blind hatred McKay holds for his \"protagonist,\" the smug unctuous suits and a drunken, dumb as a post George Bush the Second.\nUtilizing a heart donor as his omnipotent narrator McKay opens with Cheney as a surly \"deplorable\" lineman, with an ambitious wife (Amy Adams) who slaps the weakling into shape. Then from pole to pol McKay drags Cheney through the mud from one reel to next with Lady Macbeth in tow pulling him upstream while dark figures with familiar names insinuate evil actions.\nThe character assassination does not end with just Cheney and his wife. Bush (Sam Rockwell) is treated as a dim witted drug store cowboy shaking in his boots under the spell of Svengali Cheney while special attention is reserved for Donald Rumsfeld (Steve Carell) as a foul mouthed, cynical climber, career in tatters cowering in a file closet at film's end. It is a far cry from the far more corroborated story of Rumsfeld courageously assisting during the Pentagon attack (covered in the film) than this fiction and more or less sums up the gross dishonesty of McKay which to be honest is never in doubt. His Jimmy Carter shout out, albeit brief and unintentional might be the film's funniest moment but also how out of touch our earnest auteur is with his subject matter.Vice is a cautionary big bad wolf telling for those in the throes of Trump Dysfunction Syndrome with the usual boogeymen out to get them. They can relieve their paranoia and justify their resistance for a moment through this manipulation by McKay who conveniently makes his case with a bogus narrator and a claim that Bin Laden did not hook up with another terrorist because he did not like his mom.

Both of them were fantastic and deserve to be nominated for awards. Steve Carell and Sam Rockwell who I am both big fans of played their characters like they were cartoons and felt very unrealisitc and took me out of the movie.This movie tried too hard to be like The Big Short and failed miserably at it. It had no idea what kind of movie it wanted to be and was an odd mix of biopic drama, documentary, dark-comedy, and political thriller and never came together. Although Bale is great as Cheney, we never gain any true insight into him as a person or what drove him other than he is power hungry. There isn't even much of a story here and instead the movie just hops from scene-to-scene showing big moments in Cheney's life. The narration was awful which in the first 5 minutes tells us that most of America is stupid and doesn't want to know the truth about how evil Cheney is and adds nothing to the movie but to spoonfeed us information that isn't all that hard to understand. This movie advertises itself as an \"Untold True Story\", but there is nothing new here to learn about Cheney or the Bush Administration you can't learn by skimming a Wikipedia article. While a good amount of the film is historical accurate, it exagerrates Cheney's involvement in a lot of areas and only skims or completely glosses over his in others. There is a montage towards the end of the film that implies Cheney is responsible for almost all the major problems in the world that goes on for nearly 10 minutes and is laughably bad.I despise Dick Cheney and am no conservative, but this film is the exact kind of liberal smugness that so many people in America are tired of. It feels like Adam McKay was less interested in making a compelling biopic and more interested in just making a 2 hour movies on how much he hates Dick Cheney. It honestly felt like it was put together by an leftwing type Infowars organization. Aside from the performances, I'm honestly shocked this got nominated for any Golden Globe awards. I think this could have been a great movie with a different director. Even Oliver Stone's mediocore Bush movie is miles ahead of this.",

Yes, it works with many dictators that way but also in the common political regime. The film was similarly shot like Adam McKay's previous effort \"The Big Short\" - giving it a semi decumentary style with the right amount of wit but without ignoring the seriousness of the story. I think in the case of the \"Vice\" McKay brought that style to near perfection. I am also glad he did not ignore to show us more positive sides of Dick Cheney sides and his personal life. Like the fact that one of the reasons to run for President was to keep his daughter's private life safe. The other reason this movie works so well is the perfect choice of actors. Christian Bale is terrific as Cheney and not only owned his mannerisms but added a lot to it. The line deliveries were perfectly and so well that it really stick with the audience. Bale's transformation aside it was also a very deep and thoughtful performance. The work of a masterclass actor. Another performance that stood out was definitely Sam Rockwell's George W. Bush. You could blame him for being too cartoonish and being a caricature.. but wasn't that what Bush was anyway? Sorry.. politics aside... yes Rockwell imitated Bush but he imitated him perfectly to the point. Amy Adams also shines most of the times. Her opening scenes was a bit too over the top for my tastes and really not a good example for a caricature but she saved her performance throughout the film and give a very commanding and charismatic performance. Steve Carell is very underrated here. Especially in the first half of the film he was a real scene stealer and played the role with a mix of great self confidence and self irony. The rest of the ensemble is also simply good there is hardly any weak spot to find. Like Alison Pill has one tremendous scene in the middle of the scene, very short but memorable. And Jesse Plemons is always a pleasure to see. His connection to the story offers a great and very though provoking twist and really nails what the film is all about. A great political piece... with a lot of wit, seriousness and involving many of the years finest performances.",

Christian Bale fashions an infectious bully in Cheney whose heart is his Achilles heel. He is presented as a man whose ambition is fueled by Lady Macbeth (oops, his wife). He is presented as a bumpkin early on and then makes the crossover to the thing he becomes without a lot of thought for the bodies left lying around. Of course, like many who have never faced warfare first hand, he is proud of sending American forces to fight for the aggrandizement of his supposed boss (and die facing an enemy that did not have weapons of mass destruction). I did like Carrel's portrayal of Rumsfeld. The cutting with stock footage of war and politics has been done so many times already and the dead guy narrating seemed really odd. It's an OK movie, but without Bale it is quite pedestrian.",

It was so well acted, and they set up a lot of potentially interesting plot threads that never panned out or went anywhere, so there was no real depth or emotion to any of the events depicted. The whole movie was directionless and I felt like I was watching a clip show rather than a story where there were stakes and consequences for the characters involved.

The closing montages blithely suggest that his political actions can be linked to such events as school shootings and California wildfires. Surely there are more people to burden with blame, despite a unitary executive theory, as warmongering is ultimately a group effort.The movie admits, through its own opening titles, that history is not likely to offer enough details to satisfactorily depict the inner workings of the Cheney mind, nor what makes him tick, except for a troubled heart. Director and writer Adam McKay leaves us with a similarly unsatisfying movie that tries to fill in some of history's lacunae through forced dialogue, voice overs, and a partially omniscient narrator. We also persist with The Big Short's gimmicky breaking of the fourth wall, cutaways to stills, and visual metaphors to board games.Yes, the make-up artists did a great job and the acting is so good you can almost hear sympathetic vibrations of Batman whenever Christian Bale half-barks, half-grunts out his self-absorption.

When the Cheney in the movie asks the Rumsfeld in the movie, \"But, what do we believe?\" and the Rumsfeld in the movie laughs (something I saw mentioned in a review, so I should've known), it doesn't make any sense. People don't *talk* that way. And understanding how these key figures think and act is crucial.It's as unrewatchable as Oliver Stone's \"JFK\" (and makes Spike Lee's flawed \"Malcolm X\" still seem like a *movie*). You simply can't wind characters up, cast them, shoot the whole thing, and then edit it together like it's a documentary going \"See?\" the whole time or you end up with a mess like this, where every choice seems (and *becomes*) arbitrary because there's no other dramatic choice being made but to cajole you. For someone who's overwhelmingly on the side of the filmmakers' project, all I felt was resentment. This is what you call a polemic -- a charge often levelled at Michael Moore as a filmmaker (like in the case of his recent if not-quite-excellent then still-pretty-good \"Fahrenheit 11/9\"), but his movies still *move*.PLUS: If you don't know what \"Operation Scorpion\" is, Google it. (It makes all the dialogue in the movie about the debate over going to Iraq appear fallacious.) It's the Cheney/Rumsfeld/Wolfowitz plan to go after Saddam from before *they even took office*, going back to what might call their late '90s, \"think tank\" days. (If you wanna know why, it's because Saddam took Iraqi oil off the dollar, and put it on the Euro. That simple.)You'd learn more from the Jonah Hill movie \"War Dogs\" (by the director of \"The Hangover,\" no less) about why we went to Iraq than this movie, because that one just focuses on an evocative and telling slice of life, rather than this overboard overview. Ditto \"The Devil's Playground\" (about Uday Hussein's double, who had at *least* one, like did his dad, and his brother Qu'say, and Hitler, and Stalin -- you could say it's page one of \"The Dictator's Handbook,\" to protect against assassination attempts!).Needless to say, I had really liked \"The Big Short,\" so I had higher expectations for this one.

For some reason he persists in wheezing all the way, making the character even more revolting, and already as Batman you could never understand why he had to wheeze all the time. Is there anything wrong with his voice? You certainly begin to suspect something like that. But the character is awesome and actually reminds you sometimes of Orson Welles' character of Citizen Kane - the same total obsession with a delusional sense of power.In the beginning he is just a good for nothing, a line worker in Wyoming, kicked out of Yale for getting drunk all the time, but his life turned in an interesting direction when he met Donald Rumsfeld, the best actor of the film (Steve Carell). They then worked together all the way into the White House, until Cheney had to kick Rumsfeld out when everything was lost, Bush Junior with the biggest king size caca on his hands in the history of America, the Orient devastated with 600,000 civil victims, the rise of Isis and islamic radicalism and so on. Bush Junior won the presidency with only +500 votes with a recount of the votes of Florida, (where Bush Junior's brother was governor with some influence,) forbidden by the Supreme Court, dominated by Republicans. Bush Junior as a former alcoholic was next to totally incompetent as president, wherefore he left it all to Dick Cheney, who made the best of it, seeing his life's chance to do something for the American oil oligarchy, and 9/11 became the springboard. The oil fields of Iraq make out the only reasonable motive for what happened. A majority of investigations indicate constantly more clearly and undeniably the probability that 9/11 was triggered by the Bush Junior administration to enable the American oil oligarchs to get rich from the Iraqi oil fields. In the film the most enduring scene is also the shortest, but will nevertheless stick forever in your mind, when the oligarchs mete out the Iraqi oil fields between themselves, just before 9/11. There couldn't be a more obvious motive. What you can't understand is how Tony Blair, PM of Britain, could allow himself to be duped by so obvious a deception by such a pathetic character as Bush Junior.The music (Nicholas Britell) of the film is also very good, and most fascinating is the other story of the soldier Kurt, who is allowed to tell his story, which eventually meets Dick Cheney's. It's not only Bush Junior's vice president who is on trial here but the entire Republican establishment of oil oligarchs, their villainy exposed in an eye-opener of considerable dimensions. A film like this deserves a whole world of praise.",

            "content": "GRADE: B+THIS FILM IS HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.IN BRIEF: A dark satirical film that refuses to shy away from all of the political corruption during the Bush years, with a virtuoso performance by Christian Bale as evil personified.JIM'S REVIEW: Andrew McKay's Vice has moments of brilliance along with its heavy-handed political message. It mixes sardonic wit with fascinating propaganda as it depicts a damning portrayal of one of the most amoral politicians in American history, former vice president Dick Cheney.This compelling biography uses satire as a basis in its storytelling of political intrigue that happened behind White House doors. We are shown Cheney's early years of alcoholic stupor and aimlessness and watch his eventual rise to Washington's top elite. Multiple images, due to Hank Corwin's expert kinetic editing, continually bombard the screen with pop references and vintage archival footage (or detailed reenactments) to cover decades of unrest in our country for the past fifty or so years. Mr. McKay's literate and admittedly biased screenplay takes on massive amounts of history (Watergate, Vietnam War, 9/11, Guantanamo Bay, etc.) in its tale of one man's insatiable thirst for power and mostly succeed in its epic filmmaking.Vice is certainly not a glowing tribute to its subject. Quite the opposite. It is a condemnation of a ruthless man hell bent on furthering his own wealth and fame. Its dense narrative doesn't spare any victims and aims the blame directly at its famous rogues gallery of political icons who systemically polarized our nation.Mr. McKay is a fearless director and he creates a stunning film. He takes risks to intellectualize and promote his personal vision. Yes, there are some minor creative missteps in his outrageous and deliberate filmmaking approach that are gimmicky and pretentious, while other touches are spot-on genius.The ensemble is first-rate. Everyone looks the part. (Kudos to the artisans in the hair / make-up department who bring such authenticity to their craft with even the smaller supporting parts. The make-up design seamlessly disguises the actors and its resemblance to these politician is uncanny.) There's Sam Rockwell as President George W. Bush and Steve Carell as Donald Rumsfeld. Lisa Gay Hamilton plays Condoleezza Rice, Justin Kirk is Scooter Libby, and Tyler Perry as Colin Powell. Jesse Plemons plays Kurt, the film's mysterious narrator whose voiceovers tell this tale with a decidedly clever twist. All are terrific in their roles.But (literally) the heart and dark soul of the film is Christian Bale's portrayal as the devil personified and he is perfection in this role. This is a great performance, one that will be remembered for years to come and very Oscar worthy. The actor is unrecognizable in his physical transformation. He captures that gravelly voice, his cocky smirks, and bitter arrogance with ease. Mr. Bale is also given solid support by Amy Adams as Cheney's devoted wife, Lynne. The actress plays the woman behind the man just as savvy and ambitiously corrupt, a modern-day Lady MacBeth. In fact, the film is truly a Shakespearian comedy/ tragedy, complete with its own satirical scene using Iambic pentameter dialog that is hysterical...Just one of its unexpected brilliant moments.Vice is a flawed but earnest expos\u00e9 about a politician who overused his authority without any remorse or punishment. One proven fact is that Cheney was above the law as vice president and his behavior went on without any checks or balances. As one of the film's powerful images, lensed by cinematographer Greig Fraser, states, \"When laws end, tyranny will begin.\" Parallels to today's uncertain times seem sadly obvious. Films like Vice are important reminders...wake-up calls that we are destined to repeat our mistakes. Thanks to Mr. McKay and his crew's passion and talents, Vice earns our attention and our outrage.",

So enigmatic that I couldn't even despise him because I almost admired the way he fooled everyone from within and from outside, and pulled the strings of America's policy during the controversial years of Bush administration.Now everyone would agree that the War on Iraq wasn't worth it, that it sowed the seeds that made local terrorism grow into monstrosities like ISIS, but the film doesn't try to preach a choir, it just tells us the story of a man who wanted to be important and powerful in order to please his wife who believed in him at the lowest point of his life. He could get to that highest point precisely when he knew he was at the right time (September 11), the right place (VP Office)... with the right president (W.).For Godfather fans, Dick Cheney is exactly as if Michael Corleone's archenemy Hyman Roth became the consiglieri of Fredo , he spent all his life getting all the connections and networks with business corporations, lobbies and think-thank organizations, consolidating his power and his wealth and then, it was like the whole purpose of his life was served on a silver platter with four hi-jacked planes for starters. Whether served to fulfill his selfish desires, you've got to admire the opportunistic genius of the man and his mastery of Machiavellian arithmetics.His method to get what he wants is fool-proof, if he wants it, it must be right, if it serves his power, it's legit, if USA does \"x\", then \"x\" is good, if he needs to bomb Iraq, then anything that harms or attacks USA comes from Iraq. The only justification is the end. And Adam McKay chronicles the slow but patient ascension of a man who knew how to wait for his turn, who thought when other acted and made the craziest and deadliest move sound reasonable thanks to an extraordinary capability to manipulate words and distort facts. Still, for what it's worth, he was a good and loving husband, and a good father to his daughters. The man had a brain, and a heart, albeit a fragile one.And you've got to hand it to Adam McKay to make such a spellbinding character study of a man who strikes first as a boring and sinister bureaucratic. Some men carry auras with them, when they enter a room, you can't help but look at them with respect and admiration. Cheney is overweight, bald, not too good looking and his average looks work like the perfect cloak of invisibility, he doesn't have the wisecracking flamboyance of Rummy (Steve Carrell steals the show as Donald Rumsfeld) or the federative amiability of W. (sorry Carrell but Rockwell got the nomination) but since he was born to be that man in the shadows, he knew too well how to use it.If anything, the film is a school-case for all of us Tom Hagen wannabe who despise their statuses as advisers because you never feel the real thrill of power, while the reality is that the power doesn't belong to the hand but to whatever orders the move. Cheney not only guides the hand but also knows how to manipulate the law and prevent the legislative or judiciary power to interfere, believing there can be a way to exercice power unilaterally. There's something almost satirical in his rise to power but no matter the artistic licenses taken by McKay, the numbers and facts never lie, and let's see what the other \"Don\" is holding for us in his pocket.I liked the film, I love that every once in a while, there's a POTUS whose reign is so rich and controversial that it works as inspiration for great movies, seems like good old W. Is the new Nixon and many films set during his administration prove to be valuable. But there's just something about McKay, I don't know if he's the best director, but he's the best storyteller out there, and from the very first minutes, I was literally glued to the screen with a wide grin on my face. I enjoyed every minute of the film, and I reacted to some outburst of directing genius with such loud laughs I was surprised the film wasn't tagged as a comedy.Christian Bale totally disappears behind his character so it's almost an insult to talk about performance, he's not the favorite but it takes a lot of talent to play a character so used to act in the shadow that he almost seems inhabited by a shadow, always talking in secrecy, choosing every single word with calculated carefulness. Amy Adams is good that goes without saying but offers an interesting \"mise en abime\" dimension to the film as the woman behind the man behind the great man, the VP's VP so to speak. She's the kind of woman every man would love to have, we wouldn't change for ourselves but we'd do the impossible for someone we love. In its own right, \"Vice\" is a great love story.Of course, one can't ignore the documentary value of the film, it's a companion piece to Michael Moore's \"Fahrenheit 9/11\" but it's far more entertaining thanks to McKay's unique tone and surrealistic intrusions, not as flashy as \"The Big Short\" but you just have to appreciate the way McKay loosens up a little without affecting the seriousness of his movie. These McKay-isms tend to disappear during the last act and the film becomes so solemn in tone that I was going to rate it a 9 instead of 10 unless McKay blew my mind one last time. And he did!Speaking for myself, this is the best film of 2018. Clearly, Adam McKay had nothing to envy from Oliver Stone or Spike Lee, he makes political movies, intelligent movies and he makes you laugh, what more could you ask for?",

            "content": "The rise to political power of Dick Cheney (Christian Bale) is highlighted beginning in 1963 when his future looked bleak and peaking during his term as US Vice-President from 2000 to 2008.There are some ways this film is a paradox. At over two hours, it seems that too much is covered. On the other hand, there are times it seems that too little is covered.Like other political biopics \"Nixon\" (1995) and \"The Iron Lady\" (2011), \"Vice\" is about a well-known polarizing figure whose impact on many people was strong. The two earlier films delved into the insecurities of their lead characters while \"Vice\" covers too little in this area. But in fairness, like the other two films, \"Vice\" does show the human side of the focused political figure, thus rightly avoiding one-dimensional villain stereotyping while pulling no punches on the villainous acts that did take place. Cheney is clearly dedicated to his family including a daughter whose life situation is far from what is traditionally accepted in his Republican party.While some of the players of Bush Jr. administration are acknowledged during pivotal times like 9-11 and the Iraq War, the important role of Condoleezza Rice is reduced to a few minor moments in meetings. But despite flaws, \"Vice\" has notable strengths. Bale is quite solid in the lead role. He ages well (with great make-up experts) in a period of over forty years. Also, his final monologue is mesmerizing. And as Dick's wife Lynne, Amy Adams does a very good job as a woman of great talent stunned in a time period when such women had very few opportunities to meet their own potential.While much negative attention is aimed at the current US presidency, \"Vice\" reminds us that one of the most monstrous presidential administrations took place not long ago. Many innocent people are still paying the price for it. - dbamateurcritic",

            "content": "There was genuine surprise in 2015 when filmmaker Adam McKay delivered multi-Oscar nominated dramedy The Big Short, with people shocked that the man responsible for Talladega Nights and Step Brothers was more than just a slacker comedy kingpin.Examining the very un-funny true story of America's housing market collapse and the greed that led to the occurrence, The Big Short was a sharply written, solidly acted and energetically put together piece of film-making, that led to McKay duly being praised for his efforts.For any fans of The Big Short, McKay's newest event picture Vice will feel instantly familiar, as the director and writer takes the same approach that worked for The Big Short as he examines the life and times of famous American political figure and one time Vice President Dick Cheney.Cut very much from the same cloth, Vice sadly doesn't feel as naturalistic or free flowing as it's predecessor, as it looks to instill a rather depressing tale with the same smarts and energy as McKay's early venture, but instead finds itself feeling forced and more manufactured in the process.Vice is still far from a bad film in the typical sense of the word and it's at times confronting and eye-opening in it's bleakly realized view on America's political landscape and its examination of dangerous power trips but there's a lot of Vice that feels like it lands with a thud, while the black humor employed by McKay and his team only works half of the time.Led by a star-studded cast that's anchored by yet another physically committed Christian Bale turn (one that will get an Oscar nomination but likely to fall short against Bradley Cooper's A Star is Born turn) that's ably supported by typically strong performances by Amy Adams, Steve Carell and Sam Rockwell, Vice is an assured Hollywood production but it's one that runs before it walks, as it rushes along its way without ever creating a heart and soul to build upon.McKay himself has claimed that Vice is to be seen as a pure comedy but upon viewing it's hard to take this statement on face value, as the film deals with a number of heavy and complicated issue's, a number of which are explained in entertaining and easy to understand fashion, and when all mixed in together, it creates a sometimes rocky affair that drags just as much as it flies.Most glaringly, despite Bale's and the other cast members solid acting turns, by the time Vice's two hours plus are up you don't actually feel like you know Cheney that much better from when you started, with McKay frequently consumed with other agenda items, it seems to be that the man behind the headlines was an illusive one to pin down, meaning those seeking a genuinely well-rounded account of the man will be left sorely disappointed.Final Say -Finding entertainment in a far from entertaining subject or subject matters, Vice is eminently watchable but undeniably underwhelming all things considered. After the roaring success of The Big Short, Vice sees McKay regress slightly but surely, with the talented filmmaker needing to make sure his next mix of political commentary and comedy finds it's heart before it heads on it's merry way3 mid-film credits out of 5",

But not all the scenes are so well constructed, and often they make their point with a bludgeon instead of a ballpoint. Right wing Republicans will find no joy here and there is a clear liberal slant, but the facts are what they are (e.g., no WMD in Iraq).

Unfortunately it fell short.Positively, the acting, particularly Christian Bale's portrayal of Dick and Amy Adams of Lynne, was superb.However, Vice is trite and overblown. As The Atlantic review captures it: \"The (invented) dialogue between the principal characters less resembles how conservatives actually talk than how liberals sometimes like to imagine they do, full of malice and disdain.\"To be sure, Cheney is an enigmatic character who took strange turns and also did damage internationally. But there were many alleged conversations that made things look bad which have no genuine historic confirmation.And particularly McKay's take on the 80's and the Reagan era, especially the rationale he gives regarding taxation, is nonsense. It fits Trump but not Reagan. It's almost as if he were labeling Reagan another Trump. Reagan has his issues but he's far removed both personally and ideologically from Trump. McKay's lack of nuanced understanding of the conservative movement in the past makes this film fall big(time) short and crash.Finally, in a world in which Donald Trump constantly cries \"Fake News,\" creating an epistemological quagmire in the public and political arena, this film with its shallow and blatantly false takes at times only plays into the hands of Trumpian Propaganda and does little more than add another brick in the wall of the great divide between liberal and conservative in America.Perhaps McKay would have done better had he stuck either to humor alone or to enlist a quality historian as he did in The Big Short. He did not.So unfortunate.",

This is going to be an extremely divisive film due to the inherent nature that its subject matter is about a controversial figure. For me personally it was an interesting and uncomfortable watch that was definitely worth it.Adam McKay has done it again, first with \"The Big Short\" and now with this film. He has managed to take such a huge and complex story/historic event and make it manageable for all audiences to understand and follow easily. In this film its mainly achieved with narration from the brilliant Jesse Plemons, which is not only informative but adds great levity to the film which works really well. There is some really complex stuff going on in this film but McKay has found a way that makes the boring seem interesting and palatable. I don't know how he does it but his directing and writing style is so unique that it just works, I cant really describe it he has a great balance to his films. Heavy, complex subject material made into something entertaining, manageable and informative.Now obviously there was much attention payed to Christian Bale's transformation into playing the role of Dick Cheney and my word does he not disappoint. Bale is simply fantastic in the role and does one really important thing........thats make Dick Cheney as grounded and human as possible. For all the horrible things the man has said to/ or has done, the film and Bale have opened up the story of the man from the beginning which paints a slightly different image in your head of him. Dick Cheney is still not a nice man but for me there is more to him that makes you know why he got into politics, his life and his health.All the other cast members Amy Adams, Steve Carell and Sam Rockwell are all really good in the film and definitely deserve some acclaim because without their performances as well, the film wouldn't work as well.One part of the film that I like the most is the fact that from the get go, tells you that it was very difficult in uncovering information on Dick Cheney, but they tried there best. They are scenes in the film where the narration says they have no idea what happened, I really appreciate the honesty on McKay's part here letting the audience know that it was really difficult in finding information on the events that took place in this film.Overall 80% out of 100 or 8 out of 10 its a very good film, even though for me personally I found it a little uncomfortable at times but I guess thats the point. Its definitely gonna be controversial in America right now erm...........yikes........there are obviously parallels to their \"situation\" now!!!! However I firmly believe its still a film for everyone, so just go a see it and make your own mind up!PS: The film even gives you the reaction to the film after the credits its a genius move but sad as well at the same time.",

Christian Bale shines as Vice President Dick Cheney, giving life to this unknowingly important real life character. The portrayal of Cheney provides the film with its own sense of style fit to the life and mind of its own character, and though it struggles to find its footing with this at times, there is no doubt it feels like the right choice. The film shines most when it allows the characters to truly act and show themselves, rather than dedicate itself to the task of just telling a story. The film knows it isn't common, it knows its insane, and it doesn't hold back on showing any of that. Adam McKay continues to shine as a director, proving himself not only to be a great comedic director, but a great director period.

            "content": "From Adam McKay, comes Vice (2018), an often funny and occasionally clever biopic of the former Vice President Dick Cheney. Although I left the movie theater with an overall feeling of enjoyment, Vice still didn't impress me nearly as much as The Big Short (2015) did, nor did it make me laugh as much as McKay's earlier works such as Anchorman (2004). I think Vice has a lot working in its favor, primarily an excellent screenplay and immensely talented actors, but it struggles to find its feet for the first third of the film. To me it seems that McKay might have gotten in his own way a bit in terms of the direction. He had all the pieces he needed to create a brilliant film, but not enough restraint to assemble them coherently. Somewhere amidst all of the cutting across time periods, excessive narration, and frenzied editing lies a great movie, which is why I was more satisfied than dissatisfied with the overall film. The first act of the movie, which chronicles Cheney's rise to power, from college dropout, to White House chief of staff, to the CEO of Halliburton, is where I took the greatest issue with Vice. This entire section of the film suffers from a variety of problems, most notably pacing and tone. The first 45 minutes came off as rushed, like McKay was trying to jam in as much backstory as he could before getting to Cheney's appointment as Vice President, which was clearly the story McKay wanted to tell. This exposition-heavy first act wouldn't seem quite as out of place had it matched in tone to the rest of the movie. The last two acts of the film deliver some stellar comedy in McKay's signature style, whereas the beginning of the film only has one or two moments of the absurd brilliance we love from the director. The beginning of the second act is where the movie truly began for me, as it was clear McKay had finally gotten to the part of Cheney's life that he found the most interesting and appalling. From there, it was mostly smooth sailing with lots of laughs and terrific performances along the way. After seeing the trailer a few months ago, Vice became my most anticipated movie of the holiday season, so perhaps my expectations going in played a hand in why I felt underwhelmed by the film. However, I still maintain that McKay's sophomore effort in his award-winning turn is not his best. It isn't the home-run I was hoping it would be, but it certainly wasn't a strike out either. If you can reign in your expectations and judge this movie separately from The Big Short, Vice is a perfectly enjoyable satire, and therefore worth seeing.",

Way too long, and way too heavy-handed in making every scene an indictment of Dick Cheney as villain extraordinaire who singlehandedly and intentionally connived with his cohort to start the Iraq war. Anyone with a brain who lived through 9/11 and the aftermath knows it was much more complex than that. If this film attempted to show the multi-faceted situation, including poor intelligence by government agencies, majority of Congress voting \"yes\" to get rid of Sadam Hussein and start a war, and unbridled emotional response to an unexpected and devastating attack, this would have been a more factual film that the audience could get involved in. It could have been a great movie, rather than a biased, politically motivated exercise that used a hammer to blame rather than to learn and understand. Slides were used toward the end to put the nail in the coffin in case the audience missed the point, and became more propaganda than involving cinema. That said, actors were very good, especially Amy Adams as Lynne Cheney, who was a far more interesting person than I ever knew...would have been great to focus more on her family background and achievements...Steve Carrell as Donald Rumsfeld...and Christian Bale as Dick Cheney, who was good, but sometimes seemed to be involved with creating the character than being the character.",

            "content": "The world today is a politically charged place and with it comes a war of opinions, views, and media mayhem that many thrive on. So of course we have Hollywood raring to go, bringing a production of its own to toss into the game and hopefully wow. So Robbie K is here to give his opinions on that movie as he reviews the latest film:Movie: Vice (2018)Director:\nAdam McKay\nWriter:\nAdam McKay\nStars:\nChristian Bale, Amy Adams, Steve Carell\nLIKES:The Makeup\nThe Editing\nThe Presentation, somewhat\nThe Pace\nThe Acting\nThe ExplanationsSummary: Hands down my appreciation of this movie starts in the art of making the characters come to life in their looks. Hollywood's resources of time traveling makeup artists continue to be abundant as Vice brings their talents to new levels. Creating Chaney in all his ages alongside his family is spectacularly done, transforming Bale and his colleagues into the various political players of the game. It's sleek, it's beautiful and worthy of an Oscar award in my opinion.\nPast that though, the rest of the movie is very well presented at parts to grant you a political biography that is certainly comedic at times. The editing work of integrating their characters into real life footage is certainly impressive, keeping you immersed into the film without losing too much screen time for the actors. Speaking of which, the acting is super well done, with Bale obviously getting top billing for how well he matched Chaney's mannerisms and presentation quite well from the footage I've seen. The rest of the cast supports them well in this semi-political farce working to bring the turmoil of the political warfare into the screen.\nYet the thing this reviewer appreciates in regards to the presentation, outside of the impressive recreation of events and use of footage, is the sort of semi-narrative taking place to explain what is going on. The history of acts, scandals, and who was involved in what escapes me since leaving high school, but this movie is there to fill in the gaps. As the narrator takes you through the times in a semi-quick pace, one begins to learn the various acts and ratifications Chaney went through in his supposed goals and plans. As such, one should have a small compass to guide them through all the red tape and get to the end, even if you are not up to date on the latest history of our politicians. Thus, it's not too hard or boring to follow.DISLIKES:The Presentation At Times\nEpisodic At Times\nMore Integration Of Other Characters\nThe Jaded EnergySummary: When it comes to artistic style, you give them points for originality and creativity, but that indirect manner sometimes was a little convoluted. The back and forth between time periods, the representation of Chaney fishing, and the nonlinear presentation muddied up the water for an already heavy story. In addition, all of Chaney's historical \"triumphs\" felt very chopped up, the episodic principles sort of thrown up in the air and landing in bite sized pieces that had just enough sustenance to whet your appetite, but not provide the most power it had for the drama component that I think the trailers painted.\nInstead the film focused more on the comedy aspects, sort of looking to point out Chaney's involvement in politics from a certain point of view. For one thing, the characters were very extreme, grandiose displays of political characters that while impressively acted, was a little lacking in terms of the characters the trailer painted. The comical approach is certainly unique, but I guess I was expecting a little more of the biography component than the farce they chose to approach. Certainly, the biggest limitation for audience members might be the jaded energy this movie has to offer. Like the new stations of cable television, this film presented Chaney's reign from a certain angle, some of which is based on truth and some of which could be Hollywood magic. If you are a particular side of the political spectrum, you might just find yourself angry with the movie, rather than entertained or engaged by the political venue displayed.The VERDICT:The Critics certainly have got the right idea about praising Vice as the work of art in terms of editing, acting, and make up get mad praise for the investment made in these areas. Yet in terms of the story and drama the trailers painted for me, the film doesn't quite agree with the atmosphere in the trailer for me. If you agree with the views of this team, the film will be right up your alley, but depending on your political alignment and your views on Chaney, the jaded presentation may not be the style you want. So is this movie worth the trip to the theater. The answer is kind of, but only if you are ready for a dryer comedy version of the Fox or CNN News presentation. Otherwise, wait for this one to come to home viewing.My Scores are:Biography/Comedy/Drama: 6.0-6.5\nMovie Overall: 5.0",

He brings such a vibrancy, energy, unique style of comedy, and an inventive storytelling style into his films, and Vice really excels in these areas.For anyone not aware, Vice tells the story of the rise of Dick Cheney in the inner workings of the US government. The story of Cheney and his Machiavellian manoeuvrings and questionable morals is astounding really. An interesting man, perhaps for all the wrong reasons, giving lots of material to draw from for the film. There are also lots of great supporting characters along the way too, who are just as fascinating as Cheney.As mentioned already, Adam McKay tells his stories in such a creative and inventive way. I love the way he presented this film, and his direction was so slick, injecting humour and light hearted brevity in the most unusual of places. The voiceover by Jesse Plemons and the way that this was weaved into the story and presented was genius. The movie mixes together biopic, comedy, drama, political thriller so seamlessly, resulting in a masterpiece of a screenplay with such brilliant dialogue.With a cast of Christian Bale, Sam Rockwell, Amy Adams et al, the performances were never going to anything but sublime. Bale was flawless in my opinion, playing Cheney to perfection. Steve Carrell was a great support, and a real scene stealer whenever he appeared. The entire ensemble were fantastic.I was a bit worried going in that a political biopic may get a bit heavy and dry, but couldn't have been more wrong. Vice felt fresh, purposeful and engaging from start to finish.Fantastic film. I can't imagine anyone being disappointed after watching this.",

Totally disjointed editing and uninspired narration has produced a sophomoric production that disappoints on multiple levels. The timeline jumps all over the place and is punctuated by inane commentary and black and white captions that try to \"teach\" the audience - just in case the message didn't hit you in the face. I'm middle-of-the-road politically, but even I was embarrassed by the blatant attempt that the movie made to express its political opinion. Yes, he loves his wife and children, and otherwise is portrayed as having no other redeeming qualities, but certainly a biopic can go a little further than that in portraying what is clearly a complex and conflicted character. High school productions have more depth and sophistication than this shallow rendition of a biographical portrayal. SAD!!!",

            "content": "When I saw the first trailer for \"Vice\", I was both intrigued and a little scared by the odd tone. Was this going to be a serious movie, or somewhat of a farce? The answer, it seems, after seeing it, is \"both\".For a basic plot summary, \"Vice\" tells the story of Dick Cheney's (Christian Bale) improbable rise to a power position within American politics. Focusing heavily on the support from wife Lynne (Amy Adams) and the friendship with Donald Rumsfeld (Steve Carrell), this film sees Cheney rise from Nixon's administration to easily the most power Vice President of all-time under George W. Bush (Sam Rockwell).Before I take a bit more of a negative tone, let me be very clear on one thing: this is a solid film that is both entertaining and a bit sobering at the same time. Cheney's story is an important one in the landscape of U.S. politics, and director/writer Adam McKay captures all the key moments and provides the necessary context. Dick Cheney consolidated more political power than any non-President (and perhaps even some Commanders-in-Chief) in history, and that is worthy of the focus here. Based strictly on material alone, this is perhaps a 10/10 star effort for me.But there's also the matter of the film's odd presentation to deal with, as I take two exceptions with the oddball style:1. I feel like the material was strong enough to \"play it straight\" without the gimmicks. The only reason I can think of for such an odd presentational style is that the filmmakers were scared that a more serious style would scare some viewers away. Simply put, all the bells and whistles weren't needed (from my perspective).2. I had no trouble becoming invested in this film because I believe its overall message to be true. However, for those not of a more left-leaning or progressive slant, \"Vice\" cares not one iota for filtering its stances a bit or taking the edge off of them. Basically, what I am saying here is that conservatives or right-leaners will be extremely uncomfortable from the get-go, as the film often does take a rather farcical tone. Strictly the filmmakers' choice, of course, but again I would argue that a straight-down-the-middle film could have been more successful at engaging viewers of multiple political persuasions.From either perspective, however, the acting is truly incredible and manages to wipe away most of the odd tonal shifts. Bale once again transforms (physically and mannerism-wise) into his character, while Adams steals the show for a time as the supportive wife figure. The entire auxiliary cast of political power-players are spot-on as well. If awards are given to \"Best Ensemble Cast\", \"Vice\" has to already be near the top of that list for 2019.Overall, I enjoyed \"Vice\" and was able to invest in its characters and message. The comic/farcical tone isn't my favorite choice for a few different reasons, but that still isn't enough to drop it below a solid 8/10 stars.",

None of this would have been possible without his wife Lynne (Amy Adams) truly a Lady MacBeth (they even recite Shakespeare to each other in bed), she gets Dick to drop anyone who gets in his way, eventually even his daughter.McKay uses various devices (eg a lion taking down an impala) to illustrate Cheney's greed and determination, sometimes what works in a Michael Moore documentary just falls flat in a drama though.

After The Big Short was released a few years ago, it seemed as though Adam McKay's career could go in any which direction. He clearly had a talent for making legitimately funny films, whilst showing perhaps his true fashion with The Big Short and his new film, Vice. Focusing on 50 years of former Vice President Dick Cheney's life, Vice is a borderline 'mess of a film'. Constantly jumping around from different eras and never truly giving enough time in any one place for us to catch our breath, but I also think this was McKay's intentions. He's admittedly coming at it from a liberal point of view and never misses his chance to throw shade at some of the vile things Cheney was allegedly or confirmed to be involved with. Christian Bale's portrayal of the ruthless leader was unsettling and something only few actors can capture with such charisma. And that's where the film succeeds the most, with its incredibly witty humor and performances. McKay's direction is a little bit too messy and 'clever' for my liking. Even so, Vice is worth checking out.7.2/10",

            "content": "The life of Dick Cheney, from his wild youth in Wyoming, to his climb through the Republican Party ranks in Washington DC, to his term as Vice President of the United States.I had low expectations for this movie. While it is written and directed by Adam McKay, writer-director of the superb The Big Short, and features an impressive cast, I figured this was going to be a one-dimensional hatchet job on Cheney. I am certainly not a fan of the former VP, but a movie that relies on caricatures, stereotypes and basically just belittling someone you don't agree with makes for dull, monotone viewing.To my surprise, the movie comes off as feeling reasonably balanced. McKay is also not a fan of Cheney, but he presents the subject in a measured, documentary-like fashion, and doesn't stoop to portraying Cheney as a buffoon. If anything, he is shown as being incredibly good at politics and doing what he does (nefarious or not).Script and direction are top-notch, making for a slick, entertaining production. The course of events, as presented, is highly plausible, making for edifying, interesting viewing. The introductory notes explain that not much is known about Cheney's life, personal or political, especially during the GW Bush era, so much of the content McKay had to create by filling in the gaps. Thus the 'facts' are open to McKay's creativity and biases. Even so, what emerges on the screen is highly believable and makes for riveting viewing.McKay is aided by a superb cast that delivers in spades. Christian Bale is excellent as Cheney, getting his mannerisms down perfectly. Amy Adams, Sam Rockwell and Steve Carell are great as Lynne Cheney, George W Bush and Donald Rumsfeld, respectively. Bale, Adams and Rockwell received Oscar nominations for their performances. Even the supporting cast includes some biggish names: Alison Pill (as Mary Cheney), Eddie Marsan (as Paul Wolfowitz), Bill Camp (as Gerald Ford), Tyler Perry (as Colin Powell).One thing: continue watching after the end credits. McKay pre-empts the partisan backlash the movie is likely to cause, and it's hilarious.",

            "content": "Adam McKay used to make painfully unfunny comedies. Some of the most childish and silly stuff out there. Then as his budgets increased 10-fold he started to hire A listers and make giant movies criticizing the right-wing and Republicans. Don't Look Up (2021) shows you his current style. A gigantic blockbuster with star actors. A mix of comedy and anti right-wing politics. Unfortunately the comedy in that movie was largely ad-libbed so you basically had a bunch of people just ... talk. It wasn't funny whatsoever and the fictional portrayal of a Trump-like president was lowbrow and pointless. The movie didn't say anything new or smart about global warming or Trump. It was just lazy mockery directed at Trump and Republicans. This movie, Vice, on the other hand is more serious. They break the 4th wall a few times, but largely the acted out scenes are serious and historically accurate which is nice. McKay's hate of all things Republican ruined Don't Look Up and many other movies, but this one is fairly okay 90% of the time. There are maybe 10 scenes that are so extremely obnoxious on the nose and progressive that you have to question the whole project. McKay inserted his own opinions into the movie in inconvenient places. Cut them out and you get a decent movie for sure. With them in it's a movie that's between fine and bad. I'd say it's just about average, but quite dry.This is a line Dick's wife says to him while he is still young and unsuccessful: \"I can't go to a big Ivy League school, and I can't run a company or be mayor. That's just the way the world is for a girl. I need you. And right now you are a big, fat, piss-soaked zero.\"Just for the on the nose stuff these sort of lines in movies are unacceptable. They are extremely unnatural. Then we have the whole weird reasoning inserted into the character. In the movie she is shown to be very conservative, but this is the sort of stuff only very progressive feminists would say. None of it makes sense. She can't go to a big Ivy League school? Why? She did go to college in real life. If her point that Ivy League schools only accepted men and that's why she went to a less significant college? That's untrue. Maybe she just didn't have the grades or right ethnicity to get into those schools? She also claims she can't run a company or be a mayor even though the first female mayor in USA was elected in 1887 - before her parents were born. I guess McKay tries to answer that in the last scene where an interviewee from the movie who was interviewed during Bush in the movie now suddenly is living in the present, 2018. He's a Trump voter now and calls the movie liberal as he breaks the 4th wall. A progressive in the room calls the movie fact-based and accuses the Trump voter of attacking facts and the Trump voter attacks him. So that's the answer we get here. A better answer would be to fix the damn dialogue in the movie. Attack Dick Cheney all you like. No one likes him. Not Republicans or Democrats. He's creepy and greedy. Just don't spew weird ideological personal opinions in the movie and then claim it's 100% factual as facts are on your side. Misconstruing facts is not really the same as facts being on your side. There are no fake scenes, but some still feel fake because you can see how they tried to make it about Trump or modern progressive movements.The movie often tries to make Dick look like the guy in charge of everything. In one scene his daughter Liz Cheney proclaims that she's against gay marriage. Dick has always supported gay marriage as his other dauther is gay. And he himself is not really political, he just likes money and power. So in the movie the gay daughter calls her parents and blames them for that Liz said. Weird scene, why are they to blame? Liz Cheney likely said it to win an election. She's actually very progressive. Today Democrats adore her for being one of the most progressive GOPs in the country. She's also the most anti-Trump Republican too and basically a Republican only because she was elected as a Republican before she turned against the party line. Basically, from the 4 people in the family we have the housewife outside politics, a non-political CEO, and 2 very progressive daughters. Since political opinions are highly heritable you can assume Dick is not naturally conservative.W. (2008) is another similar left-wing movie attacking the Bush White House. That one goes overboard with the hate and humor. Vice tries to largely be historical; it's just some scenes that let it down. But it's clearly the better movie. I just don't know why one would recommend it. It's largely a biography and not an exciting one. I actually think a documentary that avoided all these personal inputs and went harder on Dick would be way better. You get more info in less time. But it's not a movie I actively dislike. It's just... fine. I was kinda bored some of the time after all those weird scenes. But McKay usually makes way, way worse movies. This is probably the best he can do. And even his best is unimpressive.",

            "content": "This is \"Vice\", a fairly short title for a really long movie as this one makes it comfortably beyond the 2-hour-mark. The writer and director is Adam McKay from SNL and after I already disliked his take on the banking crisis from a few years ago that was vastly overrated in my opinion, I can say I did not only dislike this film here, but truly hated it. This has to do with Christian Bale too, but it's not just him. His Oscar nominations for these two films (and Golden Globe win here) feel very false, but yeah I am not surprised liberal Hollywood appreciates this kind of material. Now lets focus on this one here. I witnessed the Bush presidency first hand as I was already old enough to understand politics when he was elected (yep elected!) President back in 2000. That's why I thought this film could get more interesting than The Big Short. Boy was I wrong. You can clearly see the ambition here, but the talent is absolutely not there. This starts with all the scenes involving Breaking Bad's Jesse Plemons. Who'd have guessed he manages such a solid big screen career. Anyway, here he is pointless filler. His involvement is a bad joke and how he acts like a character overseeing Cheney's life and the attempt to make him at least a bit significant eventually through killing him off to be a donor for Cheney went all kinds of wrong too. Besides and that he cannot be blamed for, what he adds exactly in terms of his dialogues rings very false too. Most of it, especially early on, are stupid exaggerations and obscene insults even on one point. Next problem is Sam Rockwell. I really like him as an actor and I cannot say he deserved his Oscar nomination one bit this time. But it happens not too seldom that an actor gets nominated right afterwards again after his win. Jeff Bridges is another examle and there's more from recent years. As for Rockwell, it s all about the make-up. I cannot deny he really looked the part and the makeup Oscar is not undeserving by any means. But he had neither the material nor the character to make a huge difference here. But again liberal Hollywood loves filmmakers making fun of W I am not surprised. As for Bale, he was probably as good as he could have been with what he was given. Again, a whole lot here is makeup again too for sure. The Oscar nomination is okay, the Globe win is way too much.But I especially want to say a few words about the film itself. It looked really clumsy and with that I am talking about the jumps in time as well as several moments that may seem creative to the untrained eye, but actually are not. One would be the fake credits rolling in early. The next would be the conflict between a Republican and a Democrat at the very end from this study group. They say on one occasion that everything you see and hear in this picture is based on facts. Okay, lets go. Is it a fact that Cheney's new heart comes from a soldier who died in a car accident? Is it a fact that Lynne Cheney did not say on the phone she loves him back which clearly bothered him. Is it a fact that Dick reacted caringly for his daughter when she confessed to him she was a lesbian while Lynne acted cold and distant? I could go on like that. For a long time. The reality is nothing apart from the very very basic plot points here is depicted the way it happened. It is a very fictionalized movie. Did Cheney become more ruthless the older he got? Was it really him who threw his mentor Rumsfeldt and his daughter under the bus? Debatable. Here it is presented to be 100% the case and that is of course not true. Completely away from the main character, I think the film also looked very clumsy from the editing and story-telling perspective. Those jumps in time hurt more than they helped and felt very incongruent. And what was it with all these little very brief sequences in-between that felt like taken from a bad episode of Family Guy (in live action) and mediocre children's education television. You will recognize them when you see them, there are really a lot. It may be McKay's style, but it really isn't anything to be proud of. One example would be the beating heart sequences towards the end, but also during another Cheney heart attack early on, which were handled in a way where they clearly make fun of a man suffering from a heart attack. So this film is not just extremely incorrect and far away from reality and how things actually happened, it is also extremely disrespectful in an already childish manner. There is almost nothing positive I can say here, perhaps that it elaborated in a way on said lesbian daughter early on that would not make Cheney look like a monster. In addition, there were large parts of the film when it seemed as if McKay could not decide really if he wanted to make a documentary or a live action movie. Maybe he needed the former aspect to make it look slightly realistic at least. But obviously badly-written and spoken (German dub I watched) narration plus a most random witch hunt against Fox News (lets not mention the liberal-biased left-wing CNN shall we) cannot make up for the endless amount of flaws included in this movie. Huge thumbs-down and the Oscars should be ashamed for giving this one such a great deal of attention. Highly not recommended. Perhaps the worst Oscar nominee 2019. Watch something else instead.",

Americans had Bush and Cheney, we in The UK had Blair, what a time.. My skin crawled when I saw Blair, I imagine many feel the same the other side of the pond.A very good film, interesting to see it from the point of view of Cheney, as opposed to Bush, his rise to power and prominence, and all that he did.I did find the film a little overlong, and drawn out in parts, but it's a complex story, one that needed time to develop. The September 11 sequences are harrowing, and bring back to life those abhorrent events on that horrific day.The highlight, Welshman Christian Bale, who once again proves beyond doubt, that he is one of the best, he's an awesome actor. Adams is great as Lynne, and seems to be the driving force.If The U.S does it, it can't be torture, I'm not sure as to the accuracy of events here, pretty shocking. This doesn't put Cheney in a particularly good light at all I would suggest.I found some of the cutaways a little jarring at times, I'm not too sure if they actually helped the flow of the film, or got in the way.What about the intelligence .... What indeed.Very interesting, 7/10. I feel like I've learnt something.",

            "content": "While McKay tries for the same success he had with The Big Short, he doesn't quite balance the drama and humor here. It is unambiguous that the performances across the board in Vice are top notch - Bale is wonderful and deserves to win best actor for it, and the supporting cast of Adams, Rockwell, and Carell are all excellent and realistic depictions. So many scenes are funny or enjoyable just because the actors engage us. There are definitely some great scenes here - the 20 minutes or so from when Cheney takes the job to him assembling his team and plotting ahead was a pleasure to watch and felt the most like a real character that Cheney felt all movie, and the ending scene with Cheney justifying and reaffirming his actions reinforced his image. For all of those scenes, there were far more head scratching choices or jokes that didn't land. The narration was an utter failure for me, as it was never funny, not necessary for exposition, and the heart scene felt forced and out of place. Many of those meta jokes fell flat - the bedroom scene with the soliloquy also added nothing, wasn't funny, and wasn't realistic. The dramatic scenes were often effective, but many of the comic scenes didn't flow naturally, and some scenes were jarring in their contrast. The heart scene certainly is an example, and the war scene was also a strange choice. I didn't find the comedy and drama to be effectively balanced, which it absolutely was in The Big Short.My biggest problem with the film was Cheney's inconsistency and unclear character arc. Early in the movie, he is portrayed as aimless and spurred on solely by fear of losing Lynne. The sudden, single moment complete 180 seems unrealistic, but what's worse is that you would never guess that's his backstory if you came in 20 minutes into the film. His rise to political power is completely unexplained and glossed over, which is strange both because it's a sharp change from his early character so should be essential to the plot, and also because his roles as Chief of Staff and Secretary of Defense are significant, yet we don't get any sense of what his actions or role were. Once he comes to the vice presidency, it's a clear narrative of him purely craving power and never concerning himself with morals or other's feelings. We never really get a sense of what goes on in his mind aside from a couple good scenes mentioned earlier, and this combined with the seemingly contradictory and poorly explained character arc we're given, makes for a wholly dissatisfying character study.Vice is a movie I at most points enjoyed, but as I looked back on it found more frustrations and flaws than satisfying conclusions. I love the performances and there's no doubt in my mind that there is an exceptional movie somewhere in that screenplay, but this simply was not it. I did have a positive experience watching it, and while I've focused mostly on its flaws, I like the issues it tackles and most of the devices it uses. Some that were ineffective and a couple overarching plot frustrations cloud the experience, and it by no means is a great movie or comparable to The Big Short, but it's one worth watching.",

            "content": "Writer/Director Adam McKay was known for years as the writing partner/director of Will Ferrell, having written and directed such comedy gems as ANCHORMAN, TALLADEGA NIGHTS and STEP BROTHERS and then, in 2015, he stepped out of Ferrell's shadow - and the comedy world - and delivered the multi-Oscar nominated film THE BIG SHORT, a fascinating, terrifying and (at times) funny look at the financial crisis of the mid-2000's.His follow-up to this film is another fascinating, terrifying and (at times) funny look at a serious subject - the life and career of former Vice President Dick Cheney, an unassuming bureaucrat that wields much power in the George W. Bush White House. I thought THE BIG SHORT worked on every level so was looking forward to this follow-up and this one works on MOST levels.So..what does work? Let's start with the acting of the top-notch cast. Steve Carrell, Sam Rockwell, Lily Rabe, Justin Kirk and Tyler Perry all are terrific in smaller, supporting roles that depict real people (like Donald Rumsfeld, George W. Bush, Liz Cheney, Scooter LIbbey and Colin Powell, respectively). They all bring the necessary level of gravitas and ironic humor to their parts.But...make no mistake...this film stars and IS ABOUT Lynne and Dick Cheney (Amy Adams and Christian Bale) and both of these two stars SHINE BRIGHTLY in their portrayal of a a Washington DC power couple who are always calculating the political angle of any issue and how they can benefit from it. I expect both of these two actors to get Oscar nominations.What also works is the pseduo-documentary style that McKay brings to the screen (similar to THE BIG SHORT), the characters, at times, speak directly to the camera to explain something or (at one time) breaks into a Shakespearean scene to emphasize what's going on.So...what doesn't work? I'm going to start with the Narrator of this piece, Jesse Plemons. He is a solid actor who can bring a wry sense of humor - or gravitas - to the proceedings. But, to be plain about it, Plemons narrator character (who we come to find out has a VERY big role in Cheney's life) is just not interesting enough to follow or listen to. In THE BIG SHORT, this role was filled by the charm and charisma of Ryan Gosling and, I'm afraid, Plemons just doesn't have that same level of charm and charisma.Secondly, what didn't work for me was the people/events that were unfolding in front of me. There was NOT ONE character to root for on the screen. Every politician seen upon the screen was just out for themselves and were willing to screw (or stab in the back) anyone that is no longer any use for them. These are not very likable characters and I longed for someone to root for, which made this film fall short of \"GREAT\" status for me. It is a very good film - strongly acted - but not a GREAT film.If you haven't seen it, I would recommend VICE to all if, for nothing else, the performances of Adams and Bale, they are mesmerizing, just don't expect to root for anyone.Letter Grade B+7 1/2 (out of 10) stars and you can take that to the Bank(ofMarquis)",

Having lived as adults through the times depicted here, it was interesting to see how the \"behind the scenes\" accounts were handled. Christian Bale was nominated for Best Actor and now, having seen all nominated performances, to me he deserved the Oscar. He really becomes Dick Cheney.From Wyoming, Dick Cheney was by any accounts an underachiever, spurred on by his wife under threat of divorce to make something of himself. His path was long and winding but the focus for this movie is his stint as VP under Bush the Younger. Cheney is arguably the force behind the infamous attack on Iraq, justified by false claims of WMDs in Iraq. Which destabilized the Middle East and allowed the rise of Al Qaeda. If Bush and Cheney had not been in office, and only there for a technicality in Florida voting, the world would be a different and safer place today.Democratic societies work, in theory, because voters will gravitate towards those most qualified to be leaders. Unfortunately as history shows this isn't always the case because unsophisticated voters can't tell when a candidate is deceiving them. And bad leaders are elected, all over the world.Good, entertaining movie. Bale is great.",

What engrosses the film are the performances, by actors who seem to never falter even in so-so material.'Vice' Synopsis: The story of Dick Cheney, an unassuming bureaucratic Washington insider, who quietly wielded immense power as Vice President to George W. Bush, reshaping the country and the globe in ways that we still feel today.'Vice' explores Cheney's highly controversial life with less sharpness that it hopes. While McKay has a blast in parts by making the most bleak situations comical for relief, he isn't entirely on feet while exploring the story beyond the surface. I, at no point, knew if I am suppose to watch Cheney do what he's going to, or am I suppose to question it? This is a plain biopic, that despite some arresting moments, remains an ordinary watch.Mckay's Screenplay has moments of pleasure, but it never comes up as a whole. Its, at best, arresting in parts. McKay's Direction is more superior, as the filmmaker shows command in many sequences. Greig Fraser's Cinematography is top-notch. Hank Corwin's Editing is crisp. Art & Costume Design are super. A special mention for the superbly done Make-Up and Nicholas Britell's Score.Known for emboding every character he plays, real or reel, Christian Bale once again delves deep into portraying his part to perfection. Bale becomes Dick Cheney in an urgent, fierce performance, that proves his repertoire for the zillionth time. Bale's physical transformation is something to behold. Amy Adams aces as Lynne Cheney, in a performance that comes across as strongly (or even more) as Bale's. Sam Rockwell as George W. Bush, is decidedly caricature-ish, while Steve Carell as Donald Rumsfeld, has a blast. Alison Pill as Mary Cheney, is outstanding in a brief role. Jesse Plemons as Kurt, the narrator, is first-rate.On the whole, 'Vice' isn't a knockout, but the performances undoubtedly are. Watch it for the fine acting.",

If you liked The Big Short because you found it fascinating most individuals and institutions misread and misunderstood just a couple of pieces of accepted wisdom that snowballed to a depression - Vice is likely not for you.\nI'm firmly in the latter group. Many of Vice's 'poignant' moments felt contrived.

Amy Adams' performance casts a shadow over the whole movie. I remember a lot of the Weapons of Mass Destruction fiasco and it was well portrayed.

McKay should stick to flat out comedy...here he simply throws onto the screen anything that occurs to him, resulting in a hodge-podge that stupefies the audience. The acting is superb (although the wonderful Sam Rockwell is reduced to doing an impersonation), but the most outstanding aspect of the film is the casting and makeup that turns sometimes familiar faces into the biggest villains of the 21st Century. This is a failed Roger Moore mockumentary/documentary. And that's too bad because this awful crew of amoral, power-seekers bequeathed to us the world we live in now with two endless wars as their legacy. McKay fooled me once, shame on him, etc. etc. I won't see a third one of his films for sure.",

The only true hint of that however was in the epilogue before the credits. But not just that Halliburton's stock price rose 500%, no but how about the 1 trillion dollars spent chasing a ghost that we help create?This film makes a lot of accusations about Dick Cheney zeal for power, Most I believe to be true, but the \"Mad Magazine\" portrayals of Dick Cheney, George W. Bush, and the terrible casting of Steve Carell as Donald Rumsfeld make \"VICE\" look like the last sketch on S. N. L. That's always the worst segment of the show. I mostly love Christian Bale's acting ability, but not in this movie. He spent too much time impersonating Dick Cheney mannerisms which made Cheney look like one of Jeff Dunham's dummies. I fact \"Walter\" might have pulled off the part of Cheney better!I rated if 5 out of 10 for the subject matter that should have been presented in more of a crime/political thriller like \"ALL THE PRESIDENTS MEN\". But unfortunately, it came off as a dark satire comedy that unfortunately no one can take seriously. This subject matter really happened and it should not have been presented as a comedy. It's one of the most tragic episodes in the history of the world with 100,000's lives lost as a result of these political practices.I hope some brave film maker will try tell this story correctly some day soon.",

Whilst many of the actions done by Dick Cheney throughout his career are quite dark, the film doesn't just paint him as an out and out bad guy...it takes the time to humanise him, and show his unapologetic viewpoint on the world.This film tows the line very well in terms of being a dark comedy, but also an informative film that acts as a warning as to what can happen in the corridors of power if people are unchecked.

            "review_title": "Like its Protagonist, Vice Takes No Prisoners",
            "content": "Vice President Dick Cheney's life is creatively recounted in this bullish political biopic. Written and directed by Adam McKay, Vice (2018) is bolstered by incredible performances by its lead cast, but hindered by strange and often jarring film techniques that pull your attention away from the drama. Both Christian Bale and Amy Adams show once again why they are among the best actors of our time by saving what could have otherwise been another mediocre polemic against the Bush Administration.As the film opens, Dick Cheney (Christian Bale) is a young man struggling to find his place in the world and teetering on the brink of alcoholism. His wife, Lynn (Amy Adams), gives him an ultimatum to clean up his act. Cheney gets a job as an intern in Washington, DC and is fatefully taken under the wing of Congressman Donald Rumsfeld (Steve Carell), who becomes the youngest Secretary of Defense in U.S. history under President Gerald Ford. For a time, the two men's fortunes seem to go hand in hand.After seemingly retiring from politics, Cheney is approached by presidential candidate George W. Bush (Sam Rockwell), to be his running mate. Cheney manipulates the gullible Bush into handing him unprecedented control in the executive branch. He uses his influence to fill various White House positions with loyalists, and virtually runs the administration from behind the scenes, when he's not recovering from numerous heart attacks. There he pushes \"unitary executive theory,\" which seeks to hand greater control to the President, and by extension, himself.Vice interweaves these political machinations with Cheney's personal struggles. At home, he tries to juggle his deep love for his two daughters, Mary (Alison Pill) and Liz (Lily Rabe), while shielding them from the public eye. When Liz decides to enter politics, Cheney must decide between supporting her (and her position against same-sex marriage) and his longtime support for Mary, who is a lesbian. This more intimate look at Dick Cheney's life almost translates into a sympathetic portrayal. At least, his motivations are more relatable.Born Richard Bruce Cheney, the historical 'Dick' was raised in Nebraska and Wyoming. He failed out of Yale but graduated with a Master's in Political Science from the University of Wyoming. He was White House Chief of Staff for President Gerald Ford, a U.S. Representative from Wyoming for ten years, Secretary of Defense under President George H.W. Bush, and then Vice President under Bush's son, President George W. Bush. He was also CEO of an oil company called Halliburton from 1995 to 2000. Though he's been called the most powerful Vice President in U.S. history, his cantankerous personality and uncompromising support for unpopular policies tarnished his legacy.Filmmaker Adam McKay cherry-picked scenes from Cheney's life to construct his narrative, and he imagined personal moments not even Cheney himself has spoken about, but McKay acknowledged these limitations. In one scene, Cheney and his wife speak Shakespearean dialogue in bed, because there's no way to really know what they talked about in those moments. It's hard to condemn him for that. However, I've written about McKay's bizarre implication that Lynn Cheney's dad had something to do with her mother's death, and that kind of creative license is a lot less justifiable. Watch Vice with a grain of salt.It would be difficult not to compare this film with Oliver Stone's W. (2008) a similar biopic, albeit of President George W. Bush. In W., Vice President Dick Cheney is portrayed less convincingly by Richard Dreyfuss. As a supporting role, Chaney fades into the background and in one particular scene is put in his place by President Bush,who tells him not to be so vocal at meetings. Cheney's history and close relationship with Donald Rumsfeld is barely mentioned.In his defining moment, however, Oliver Stone's Cheney becomes a cartoonish supervillain as he lays out his vision for an American empire in the Middle East. Cheney's motivations in Vice are much more visceral. You feel his compulsion to defeat America's enemies by any means necessary, even if the threats loom larger in his mind than in reality. Vice's Cheney would have W.'s for lunch.Vice currently holds a 64% positive rating from critics and 57% audience favorability on RottenTomatoes. Despite generally positive reviews, it grossed $9.9 million in its opening weekend on a $60 million budget. Ouch. Maybe Vice isn't the masterpiece it pretends to be but Brian Tallerico was too harsh when he wrote: \"For people even remotely engaged in the national political landscape for the last two decades, 'Vice' offers nothing new to consider.\" This film offers a rare glimpse behind the curtain at a vice president who wielded tremendous influence almost completely out of the public eye. It's worth the price of admission.",

            "content": "Adam McKay's THE BIG SHORT surprised many because it was made by the guy who had done ANCHORMAN and TALLADEGA NIGHTS. McKay threw every trick in the moviemaking book to make a movie about a dry subject like the financial crisis entertaining, including having Margot Robbie sitting in a bathtub and explain directly to the camera complex economic terms. It succeeded well enough, even if, by the end, it felt as the film was shouting at the viewer.\nMcKay tries the same tact here with his arch bio-pic about former Vice President Dick Cheney (Christian Bale). Cheney is very much depicted as the Darth Vadar character he's been portrayed as in much of the media. Lynne Cheney (Amy Adams) is shown as his Lady MacBeth, quietly controlling and manipulating her man's ascent to the levers of power. Again, McKay tosses everything at the screen and hopes that enough of it sticks to keep it moving along and entertaining enough to his choir for its distended 132 minute running time.\nUnfortunately, the high wire act doesn't work a second time. One of the main reasons is that THE BIG SHORT was based on an exhaustively researched book by Michael Lewis. Here, at the outset, McKay admits that Dick Cheney is such a secretive man that his screenplay had to extrapolate and make assumptions to fill in the details. And, extrapolate it does! One doesn't have to be a Cheney supporter (and I certainly am not) to recognize an inordinate number of cheap shots and invented scenes along the way. Some of the gags work (the first scene involving an out of control focus group), but the percentage is much lower here than in SHORT.\nWhat's most unfortunate is that you have fine actors in Bale and Adams doing good work despite the buffoonery. The scenes where the family struggle with their daughter Mary's (Alison Pill) sexuality are genuinely gripping, but they are but a tiny island of quiet sanity in McKay's sea of impudence. The large cast does well enough including Sam Rockwell doing a broad version of George Bush Jr. And Lily Rabe as Liz Cheney. Steve Carrell tries, but never quite captures the right tone in the critical role of Donald Rumsfeld. Shooting on various gauges of film, Greig Fraiser gives the movie interesting looks, but, Nicholas Britell's score misses the mark more often than it hits.\nVICE shows the limits of McKay's 'serious' filmmaking side. He seems to be aiming for an Oliver Stone like career in that regard. But, by the time of his magnificent piece of propaganda* JFK, Stone had already become an accomplished filmmaker. McKay's scattershot approach will please those who come to root against Cheney (Bale has even referred to him as \"Satan\"), but, those looking for coherence -- or even the most rudimentary form of verisimilitude -- will find it wanting (not to mention those looking for an actual biography). By the end, McKay is literally begging the viewers to accept his pleas that he really did his research on Cheney. He doth protest too much. The viewer can spot a phony when it sees one. McKay inadvertently does something truly 'remarkable' here: He makes Dick Cheney into a sympathetic victim.* And, I mean that as a compliment!",

            "review_title": "Fascinating Premise Undone by Inconsistent Script and Direction",
            "content": "Adam McKay's \"Vice is one of those films that, at times, left me in thrall to many of its artistic elements, while nonetheless leaving me frustrated -- and, frankly, bored -- at the whole. Certain of these artistic elements -- Patrice Vermette's production design, Susan Matheson's costuming, and the makeup design (done by numerous talented hands) -- are superb throughout the film, setting the framework for what could be a compelling chronicle of the rise to power of former Vice President Dick Cheney. Unfortunately, many of the remaining elements are wildly inconsistent, transforming what should have been a powerful examination of a Machiavellian rise to power into a scattershot and confusing polemic that badly misses its target.The film's structure is episodic, but linear, with the first half tracking Cheney's life from 1963 (as a directionless young man steered by his driven wife), through his days as an acolyte to then-Congressman Donald Rumsfeld (Steve Carell), up through the ladders of power in the Nixon and Ford White Houses, on to a decade as a Wyoming congressman, and culminating in his tenure as Secretary of Defense in the first Bush Administration, overseeing the First Gulf War. The second half tracks his rise to the Vice Presidency and eventual domination of the second Bush Administration, through 9/11, the war on terror, and the Iraq and Afghanistan wars.While the journey through the first half of the film contains some interesting elements, nothing really grabs hold of the viewer because of the herky-jerky nature of the episodic story telling, and McKay's annoying habit of interrupting what story flow there is with would-be clever asides. These types of asides and episodic storytelling were used to good effect in McKay's \"The Big Short\", where they were essential to understanding the scope and details of the mortgage and financial crises of the prior decade -- in \"The Big Short\", they acted a lot like footnotes or comment balloons in explaining matters unfamiliar to those who don't read the Wall Street Journal or Forbes; in \"Vice\", these techniques fall flat, largely for two reasons. First, because the concepts underlying \"Vice\" are much easier for a layman to grasp, weaving them more directly into the story would be far less problematic than disrupting the flow with asides -- indeed, this same logic explains why the inclusion of Jesse Plemons as a third-party narrator is a seriously misguided and confusing directorial choice. Second, many of the underlying episodes are dealt with in such a perfunctory, check-the-boxes fashion, that they don't really provide us with anything more than a reference point for later in the film; in \"The Big Short\", the asides helped to deepen the viewer's understanding of what came next, while in \"Vice\", they simply provide us with a point of repetition, without any real understanding of the events or impacts on the characters that follow. This jokey approach to the material culminates in a phony credits sequence halfway through the film that is both unfunny and unnecessary.Although the second half of the film is equally episodic, it works somewhat better than the first half, as it covers Cheney's tenure as Vice President and devotes more time and thought to the various episodes. Some of these sequences are particularly interesting, including the set of episodes leading to Colin Powell's decisive speech before the U.N. justifying the invasion of Iraq (with fine supporting work from Tyler Perry as Powell and LisaGay Hamilton as Condoleezza Rice). Even in these later sequences, however, McKay's weakness for cheap jokes and overstatement gets the better of him. For example, the \"restaurant sequence,\" in which Alfred Molina does a cameo of a waiter serving Cheney, Rumsfeld and other neocons recites the \"specials\" (i.e., various types of torture and euphemisms for it) is clearly intended as biting satire on the callousness of the architects of the war on terror, but plays instead like an ill-conceived Monty Python skit. Likewise, McKay's lack of subtlety betrays itself with the film's representation of George W. Bush's (Sam Rockwell) speech to the nation announcing the commencement of the Iraq War: rather than subtly emphasize Bush's nervousness/fear by keeping him in full frame from the side (showing both the resolute upper half of his body and his shaking leg), McKay chooses to zoom in on the leg for what seems like forever, and then cuts to an identical mannerism from the father of a terrified Iraqi family undergoing bombardment. This plays more like a bad comic nudging us in the ribs to emphasize a punchline, rather than an experienced director confident in his message.This lack of subtlety and character depth in McKay's script also undermines what is clearly some very hard work by some of the most talented actors working today. Christian Bale's method acting in this role has been well-publicized, and it's clear he's pulling from some pretty deep reservoirs in playing this role, but that's the problem -- because McKay's script doesn't give the character much dimension, I was never quite able to pull back from the idea that I was watching an actor \"acting\", rather than seeing a character unfold on screen. Likewise, Amy Adams' Lynne Cheney is laser-focused, but McKay doesn't give her anything else to do, having written her as a one-note Lady Macbeth (without any of the subconscious self-awareness). Their relationship together is equally one-dimensional -- fueled by a lust for power and little else -- and gives us nothing resembling any growth or change in the characters over the course of the film. Likewise, the relationship between the Cheney parents and their daughters (particularly as it relates to Mary Cheney's (Allison Pill) sexuality) feels like little more than another box to be checked off for later reference. Pill and Lily Rabe are fine given the what they are given to do, which is unfortunately not a lot. Nor is Sam Rockwell -- last year's Best Supporting Actor for his superb work in \"Three Billboards...\" -- given much to work with; he doesn't play George W. as a complete imbecile, but he's drawn so passively as to make the character instantly forgettable. Indeed, one has to wonder how much more interesting it might have been to continue the story so as to play up the tensions of the later Bush administration, when W. began to free himself from Cheney's grip, as it would have added a new dimension to both characters. The best performance in the film comes from Carell, doing Rumsfeld justice as a man who thinks he is building Cheney up in his own cynical image, only to find himself betrayed, eclipsed, and disgraced by Cheney in the end: while Bale and Adams do a weird Shakespearean (or pseudo-Shakespearean) reading in one scene, Carell's Rumsfeld actually gets to play the tragic Shakespearean role.As noted earlier, \"Vice\" has a good deal going for it in some of its artistic elements and some of its performances to recommend, but the ambitious take that McKay takes on the material is fatally undermined by his own wildly inconsistent screenplay and direction, and in turn takes down some very talented actors with him.",

We also learn of all his struggles as a young man with alcoholism. His wife, Lynne, gave him an ultimatum of cleaning up his life or leaving the marriage. Of course, Dick went into politics and the movie does a wonderful job of telling his story....the way he rose to power and gained the respect of the American people and later had a very low approval rating after multiple scandals, Halliburton, & CIA leaks. And yes, the shooting \"accident\" is detailed as well! \ud83d\ude02 He became the most unpopular Vice President in American History based on polls. The movie also reveals a lot about his family life..his daughter's never ending quest for acceptance for same-sex rights/equality and the turmoil it caused among the Cheney's, Dick's health issues, and his daughter's Liz's run for the Senate. The narrator, Kurt is a significant character and is very clever. Even though he's fictional, his presence really adds a dramatic affect to the entire movie. Christian Bale, Amy Adams, & Sam Rockwell all did an amazing job! I was shocked to see Tyler Perry play Colin Powell! Great Movie all around! A MUST SEE!",

In my opinion, this take is much more similar to propaganda than it is to satyre or a serious and healthy condemnation.Then there's that moment with Liz Cheney, and I ask you to answer this: should a congress member support gay marriage just because her sister is gay?Lastly, when they talked about the \"liberal movie\", the measure was full. \"Is it a liberal movie just because we report facts?\". No. As I said, it's a \"liberal movie\" because you make fun of your adversary. Simple as that.",

Instead it offers a series of vignettes and sketches, played for laughs, but unfortunately neither as short nor as funny as SNL skits. Although Christian Bale does a good job of physically impersonating Cheney, the character is so poorly written that he comes across as a cardboard cut-out. Amy Adams is sorely underutilized in the role of Mrs. Cheney.\nSymptomatic of the low regard the writers have for their audience, the \"unitary executive theory\" (a key feature of the Kavanaugh confirmation before it got swamped by beer and the Devil's Triangle) is inaccurately and simplistically described.",

            "content": "I looked at other reviews of this movie before I went to see it. I expected a Political Farce and in a way it is one. When I saw Adam Scott who created The Anchorman, Ricky Bobby (Taladega Nights), and a lot of other Will Farrell films wrote the script, I expected Comedy. With Brad Pitt and Farrell producing it, I expected a lot of laughs. While there are some laughs here, the film is really a political lightening rod and more.Cheney's friends, insiders all, helped George W Bush win the Florida recount according to this movies account.Vice President Dick's power is more of an insider power than even these film makers imagined. Of course now there are some issues today these events shaped which are not addressed here, but at times the film overpowers the viewer with it's musings. It illustrates very well why this country not only has not changed but why we can not make progress.For those who wanted Hillary Clinton to be President, it goes over the highlights of her speech supporting the Iraq war (archive footage). In other words, if the Republicans and this Vice President are responsible for the Iraq war, the Clinton Republican in sheeps clothing ( Hillary is a former Walmart Board member) along with other Democrats at the time were together in this power elite alliance. That is the problem with the Democrats still in power, while they pointed the finger at Dick, they actually supported him insupporting the Iraq invasion effort. This explains the problems created in foreign relations during Obamas term when ignorant power elite put Clinton into a responsible role (Bengazi) she could not and did not handle resulting in some tragic deaths.In a major spoiler, at the end is the best punch line of all time. \"Liberals always require facts.\" I had to laugh at that. Liberals rarely require facts. Liberal Science states that \"Increasing taxes and throwing money at the Climate Change Problems will fix the problems.\" Throwing money at problems only hides them, and it never fixes anything. Money is used to reshape facts and make it look like the problems are getting fixed.This film paints the fact that the power elite always get what they want and Vice President Dick got even more than that as part of that elite. Facts do not stop the elite. Not only does this film make them up, but this film shows the line between the elite and the rest of us starkly, and is produced by those very same elite, The film almost makes Cheney look like a hero when Mary tells him she is gay and he says \"We love you no matter what.\"The film does make nice use of archive footage to paint Dick Cheney's life.\nIt starts with his DWI drive as a youth, to his near failure as a man until his wife scolds him and knocks him out of it. Cheney's power under Nixon and Ford is explored some, and in ways I have never seen on screen before. In a way it illustrates the way Nixon and the elite put Ford into power so he would pardon Nixon. That pardon is a real disaster of American History, and Cheney helped.The recount of 911 with Cheney's role in the response is shown, as well as his support of the response. Since the facts focus on Cheney, 911 gets a little short changed. Barack Obama gets sworn in (archive footage) and then the film focus shifts to Cheney's health and continuous focus is put on the abuse of power created by the powers assumed by the President (at the request of Cheney according to the film) that destroyed Americans privacy. The film goes on to Cheney's heart transplant and to 2016 and 2017.An important point skipped is that with Barack Obama as President and one party rule, invasion of privacy's powers given W Bush after 911 for the President were extended when they were supposed to expire by that party. The film dwells on these invasion of privacy powers at the end of the film and the fact it is still there, despite the Democrats chance to let those powers expire when Obama took office.Cheney is a part of the ignorant power elite, not the entire problem which is much bigger than him. When your knowledgeable enough to realize this, you can appreciate this movie more than anyone can imagine. (And this explains current issues very well) Did Cheney run W Bushs Admin?This movie does not solve any problems. It does show why power and corruption by an ignorant power elite class beyond Dick Cheney have created a more dangerous world today.An ignorant Corrupt Power Elite will kill us long before Climate Change will, and much quicker. That is the strange depressing message this movie delivers, totally by accident.Rather than condemning Cheney alone, it condemns an entirely disfunctional system.I thought that Cheney's shot gun was supposed to be the blast accident I got from this film, when I saw the trailer.\"Surprise, Surprise, Surprise!\"",

These \"horrible\" Republicans are repeatedly voted into office by \"normal\" people. And \"cuddly\" Democrats aren't averse to a bit of overseas military action themselves. Focus on making a better pitch during election season rather than making snide films after it.2. Indulgent meanders into fantasy/comedy. I don't want to see a false credits scene after 30 minutes, or a Shakespearean soliloquy, or even characters breaking through the fourth wall.3. Using the future heart donor as a narrator is just a lazy way of papering over the gaps in the storytelling.4. I'll give it one star for Steve Carell and one for Amy Adams. Their characters were much more interesting and I would have liked to see more of them. Yes, Bale does transform himself remarkably well, but he transforms into a lumbering, monotonous presence. There is no change in his tone. Cheney is the axis of the film, but Bale makes him a bore.5. I'd seen this described as a comedy but honestly there are no laughs.This was a missed opportunity to make a serious film about the Bush administration. \"All the President's Men\" had a much greater impact.

It did mean slash public spending. So now more people than ever are homeless, slash welfare benefits, go for years without pay rises. The fat cats have done alright though.McKay's satirical expose of Dick Cheney in Vice has the same attitude. When 9/11 happened, Cheney (Christian Bale) saw this as an opportunity to take power for himself and take rights away from Americans and others.It was done all in the name of National Security.The initial scenes of Cheney is a young, drunk, fat nobody. With the support of his wife Lynne (Amy Adams) Cheney lands in Washington and becomes a rising insider courtesy of smarmy, oily Donald Rumsfeld (Steve Carell.)When Cheney agreed to run for Vice President with George W Bush (Sam Rockwell) he had an eye on a power grab. When he became Vice President he made sure all the important people in the White House were under his control.Cheney used the concept of Executive Authority to widen the powers of the President and Vice President and override the checks and balances.Vice despite a remarkable performance from Bale does not wholly succeed. It's approach is not as fresh as The Big Short. The free wheeling attitude of The Big Short does not cut it here. I am not sure McKay managed to get a handle on his subject. He is just too darn elusive.Cheney is a monosyllabic bore. A cruel vindictive bully. Maybe he is not interesting enough for a biopic. Vice is just a little too messy and unfocused to be a cynical satire.",

            "content": "2018's dramatic Dark-Comedy/Satire \"Vice\" is the second film in director Adam McKay's recent losing streak (starting with \"The Big Short\"). I've enjoyed much of his past work in Comedies, from \"Step Brothers\" to \"The Other Guys\". He had a knack for making his movies incite laughter from beginning to end. At times I was entertained and even amused during \"Vice\"; but instead of being insightful or even nuetral, this film incited more \"Huh?\" and groans from me (after seeing the movie). This is due to it playing more like glorified propaganda with a smug sense of red-pilling granduer.\nThere is good to be found here; from the whip-smart editing to some emotionally effective scenes (some involving Dick Cheney's family, and one involving 9/11). I was impressed by the transformative cast, including it's leads and supporting actors (Christian Bale, Amy Adams and Sam Rockwell are all mesmerizing). Vice contains some hilarious moments and interesting ideas.\nI also appreciate the humanized portrayal of Dick Cheney and his family. He is not just a republican monster (in contrast to a lot of the story that tries to make him look like one) but a family man and caring politician with questionable but noble intentions.\nWith that in mind, the overall narrative style of \"Vice\" fails to deliver an impactful message due to it playing with facts while being condescending. Films like \"Braveheart\" and \"The Revenant\" took liberties with historical events to tell compelling stories with meaning, while not claiming to be gospel (and they certainly didn't tell the audience that most of them are just dumb sheeple, which is what \"Vice\" and \"The Big Short\" did with pride).\nThe biggest offense in the entire movie is the mid-credits scene- A fourth wall breaking scene in which a focus group argues over whether or not the movie \"Vice\" itself has a liberal bias or not. The scene ends with a conservative stereotype arguing with a liberal member of the group, then proceeding to beat him up as a female member tells her friend how she's excited to see the next \"Fast and the Furious\" movie. Congratulations, the sheeple have now been informed and they will hopefully wake up.\nI'd like to conclude this review by saying that I try my best to check my personal politics at the door when watching movies. Cinema has shown great ways of portraying American politics and hot-button issues before, but \"Vice\" is certainly not one of them.Grade- C",

            "content": "I hated this movie. I loathed this movie. This movie tried my patience in ways I haven't experienced in 15 years. This movie would need to be improved by several magnitudes before it being called schlock is justified. There isn't a redeeming feature to it. I would rather spend an evening with the real Cheney before I would volunteer to watch this crap again. It is was an insufferable experience from frame one to after the the credits.First, virtually none of the jokes land. As satire it is scattetshot and formless. A lot of the problem is derived from Bale's performance in relation to everyone else. No one besides him seems to be trying to channel their real life counterpart; Rockwell especially seems to be playing Will Farrell as Bush not Bush himself. Bale does give a very convincing, if slightly too much growl, Cheney. But alas it disrupts the comedic timing, tone of scenes and the gags don't work as a result. Worse several major gags just don't work on the conceptual level. I am suppose to be amused by Cheney doing Shakespeare why? And at least some of the gags seems to be present only to excuse some hackneyed choices of the screenplay. A few barbs against generic biopics have the not so subtle odor of a hack tying to hide their hackery.This lack of laughs could be forgiven if the film's storyline was resonant and if the underlying satire was sharp. Unfortunately, neither is the case. The narrative is a meandering mess. It plays much more like a series of disconnected vignettes than a coherent story. What concepts that do carry through are obvious-Cheney's humanity is shown by his relationship to his daughters!-or cliche-Lynne is a Lady Macbeth! Several episodes, such as Cheney shooting the guy in the face or his choice words on the senate floor are inserted for no apparent narrative or satirical purpose. Compounding this some of the licenses taken utterly miss the mark. I was gobsmacked when McKay implied that nihilism is the best way to explain or mock Rumsfeld. Neocons didn't lack beliefs; they lacked the ability to change them.This lack of humor and cohesive story would have resulted in a bad film. But this thing becomes detestable due to three features. First there is a lazy plot device (or several as text over the screen is used extensively as well) to introduce details about various legal or political matters. A character who has no development beyond delivering exposition and being instrumentalist in Cheney's story drones on and on about various Democratic bugaboos-things like the Koch brothers, the unitary executive theory and the fairness doctrine. This stuff isn't funny and its function within the story is directly told to the viewer; the cardinal sin of cinema is committed with impunity. It gives the film a quasi-documentary feel (enhanced by the use of archival footage) which would be OK if the film was making an argument about those things. But it isn't as the film contains obvious and self-aware flights of fancy; further it is mostly interested in punching Cheney and his ilk. As it is it feels like a writer-director who doesn't trust his viewers to follow his train of thought. If the viewer is even moderately well versed in the Bush years (and general history prior) nothing is obscure or hard to grasp.This lack of trust in the viewer permeates much of the film. The film has the nerve to juxtapose Cheney's most heartless act with his literal heart being removed. Likewise, there is an extended fishing metaphor and a critical scene is figuratively \"baiting the hook.\" I know this because Cheney is literally shown baiting a hook just prior to it. One suspects McKay considers people idiots.No sorry the film confirms he does consider people idiots. There are repeated jabs at people for allowing Cheney to get away with his power grab due to them being distracted by frivolous things. This occurs visually and in text. And as if to make the point crystal clear the final line, in the post credit scene, is a punch down at people who like fluffier films. This would be obnoxious by anyone. But coming from McKay it is insufferable. He was making Anchorman during the build up to the Iraq War. Clean the plank from your own eye sir!Much has been made of the smug style of the American liberalism. I think such complaints are overblown. But dear god this film makes me reconsider that opinion of mine.",

            "content": "I only want to learn history from Adam McKay. As a filmmaker, he has also focused on some awesome comedy, but I find the unique style he applies to these historical dramatizations to be what I love most about his work. He's a teacher, and his methods are top-notch. He has an inspiring knack for putting complicated events into all sorts of contexts which make his subjects approachable and engaging. He uses humor and brilliant visual representations to make difficult concepts understandable. He engages the schema I already knew, he helps me identify the gaps in my knowledge, and he fills them in. His approach to teaching is what we can only dream a public school teacher could do for our next generation.The cast rocked, and I haven't seen everything yet, but people, in my opinion, deserve awards. I think this may have been my personal favorite performance by Christian Bale, which is tough to admit, since I found him so handsome and nuts in American Psycho. His last monologue was some incredible work, and I wished it was longer, which I guess is better than wishing it shorter. (But I still wish it was longer.) Amy Adams was ruthless and engaging, which is big of me to admit, as I've never really been much of a fan. I just want Steve Carell and Sam Rockwell to be in everything, and I also always enjoy up-and-comers Lily Rabe and Alison Pill in really anything, as well. Tyler Perry as Colin Powell was understated; I didn't even realize it was him until the credits, which I was a side of him I appreciated seeing -- he felt committed to the role and fell away from it -- I didn't really know he could do that, so bravo.As for the content, there's really so much to say. I was in college in New York City during Bush 2 and 9/11. Because I was young and I was there, I've always had a strong emotional response to those events, as I'm sure many of us do, I certainly don't mean to discount anyone's experience that day. I've often felt that time period unexplored. Today's culture is so focused on what's now and next, and I guess I can understand that - it can be painful to look back. But still, I've always had so many unanswered questions about that time period. I remember knowing, for sure, and maybe more than ever, that we were being lied to; and it didn't seem possible that the buffoon in charge could have been responsible (aside from his ignorance) - 'cause he didn't seem to have the brains to orchestrate it all. I'm satisfied to have some of those answers on Machiavelli. I'd like to know more about the responsible parties for all that media and marketing, as well.More than that though, and this is what really hit me about the last few minutes of the movie after the credits, is that most of us have no idea what the hell we're really looking back at, and I think we're all quite sick of discussing events that have been so obscured by neo-America. So it's like, someone pulls out 9/11 and someone else is like, please, put it back. 'Cause who really wants to go over what we still no nothing about? I appreciate the film's insistence and best-attempts at uncovering truth, which is why, ultimately, I have to give the movie 10 stars. I really don't know if it got everything right, but damn it did a good job of making some sense out of explanations that I never quite bought. I think it's a slice of truth, and all I want is more. I really can't think of a better purpose for art, whatever the medium, right now.In fact, those last few minutes of the film inspired me further. I refuse any label. (Ok, here it is, my personal soapbox -- feel free to skip this crap.) I am not a liberal. I am someone who wants the truth, plain and simple. I am someone who cares about no issues other than the uncovering of the truth about what our America has done, and is doing, and is. I care about squashing any institutions, politicians, groups, or individuals, on any side of the coin, who seeks to obscure the truth for their own gain. Until we know who we are, how can me ever really know what we stand for? How can conservatism or liberalism exist, how can we take sides, when no one really knows what the heck is actually going on? I refuse to fight, back-and-forth, on divisive issues that continue to obstruct us gaining any perspective on who and what we really are. It's no wonder our country is completely consumed by argument and pulp culture. I've often wondered how learning became so out of fashion, and maybe it's only because we're sick of learning what spin is put on what illusion. (Phew, that's over - hope it wasn't so bad.)At any rate, if anyone cares at all, thanks for the movie. I appreciate when those who have the means seek to help us understand.",

            "content": "The story of America's most infamous vice president, wager of the War on Terror Dick Cheney, is approached with bold satire here by writer-director Adam McKay. Vice acknowledges from the beginning the secretive nature of Dick Cheney and how conjecture is perhaps needed to colour in the edges. Nevertheless, this is a ferociously entertaining film, that lampoons its subject with flashy comedy and stylistic gags. Christian Bale leads as Cheney, caked in impressive makeup. Beneath the prosthetics, however, Bale delivers a stand-out performance, deadly in its quietness and oozing with callous bureaucracy (the actor thanking Satan for inspiration in his Golden Globe acceptance speech is not unfounded). We watch the events of Cheney's life unfold; his unexpected rise from delinquency to vice presidency is told in a biopic that is pleasingly unconventional. Vice is narrated almost like a staid Michael Moore documentary, but is also unfailingly nihilistic, combining the grounded political history within amusing gags. Similarities can be made with McKay's previous film, The Big Short, which also approaches its weighty subject with a cynical mockery that you can't help but grin at. The deeper impact of this film is certainly undermined by the comedy (which at points is almost too light hearted), but Vice still gives a telling nod to the state of politics today without losing its biting humour.\nVice breezes nicely through a sizeable run time, snapping from frame to frame with a manic energy. The structural choices are somewhat zany, but usually add to the film's eccentricity. McKay's writing is unfocused at points and the narrative is far from tight-knit, though this is never at the expense of entertainment. Fourth wall breaks and a memorable scene where the characters break into Shakespearean iambic pentameter are just examples from a film that is wonderfully weird, yet never to the point of ridiculousness. Stylistic ticks like these are less ubiquitous in a final act that relies just a little too much on narration.\nThough Vice is carried by Christian Bale, Amy Adams looms with stony determination as the Lady Macbeth-esque Lynne and Steve Carrell's Donald Rumsfeld is as slimy as he is energetic (Sam Rockwell's Oscar-nominated George W Bush, in contrast, feels a little bit Saturday Night Live). Nicholas' Britell's score is luscious and pacey and Greig Fraser's cinematography is as slick as it is shocking (shots of Cheney's comfortable White House meetings snap unsettlingly quickly to flashes of the brutal torture he authorises).\nVice is not perfect, its wackiness occasionally verging on messiness, but it remains a fervid and clever biopic, that uncovers the career of one of America's most reticent yet power hungry politicians with delightfully bruising derision.",

It certainly seems so, and this film makes a powerful, totally factual case for it. Despite being a registered a Republican -- or at least, someone who believes in the values the GOP professes to stand for -- it seems incontrovertible that this man Dick Cheney et al. destroyed whatever hope we had left for the conservative movement by being so repugnantly greedy (Cheney) and tragically stupid (George W.) with the invasion of Iraq, fiscal irresponsibility, and white shoe corruption that they oversaw.But did these two dunces cause the wildfires in California? Or the illegal immigration problems at the South of the border? Come on.. Whatever Trump is doing may be idiotic, but in order to make your point, particularly to a hostile audience, you must be extremely precise with facts. The last five minutes threw an otherwise excellent film into an ideological frenzy -- for a few seconds (in the rapid sequence of cutscenes) it stooped to the level of pettiness that it was trying to criticize in the first place.This made the final post-credits scene then quite ironic; yes, the film has a liberal bias, but that is irrelevant as long as it is all factual. And it was -- until the last five minutes, and other few moments throughout the film, in which Mr. McKay was unable to control the urge to blame EVERYTHING on a bad, bad man, just because he has evidence to show that he was indeed responsible for some things.For this, I docked a couple stars.But overall, this movie is bitingly funny, an instant satirical classic, with a (mostly) honest and important message.

Also the narrator character of Vice is a bit of a let down once the viewer understands his identity.Ultimately Vice has a narrative which leans against the GOP. But I didnt spot any lies or misleading content, and feel confident the message will still come off as authentic decades into the future. In the end I feel that presenting the truth of the horror story is important than avoiding some bias for the sake of fairness. Untimately everything presented will always have a bias against what isn't presented. It's unavoidable.The film does make connections to the current politicians in the executive branch which might date the movie a bit to being made during the Trump adminstration. Rather than a movie focused solely on documenting Cheney's time in Government.To me it feels like a way to demonstrate the how some escentric ideas among Republicans from of people like Rumsfelda and Scalia could within Cheney become mainstream Republican positions today.There were a lot of small steps which were needed for the Republican party to go from created the EPA or nominating reasonable Justices like Stephens and Souter in the past to now only nominating Justices like Alito and Kavanaugh who were approved first by groups like the heritage foundation and undermining the EPA at every turn.In the background of covering Cheney the film explores and explains how that kind of shift occurred, and why we should be concerned about what happened.",

It's very daring and does not give a flip about being nice or appealing to masses. It says what it feels is right to say, and I agree with it and wholly respect how unapologetic it all is. This is the movie we needed right now, at least that is how I feel about it.\nEveryone in the room was absolutely stunned by the end of it, me obviously included, completely taken and in deep thought. Not knowing if we should laugh or cry. Someone right behind my seat cried. From what I could understand, when she was whispering to her friend, she might have been American. So there is that. I get that this could be even a little more intense as an American. Because who knows, maybe something that happened, and is depicted in Vice, affected someone very directly in her family or something like that. Never know. Also without anything like that I fully get that reaction. Dick Cheney certainly made his mark on the world, and he was pretty much unstoppable, even though he should have actually been easy to spot as someone that is too careless and somewhat void of emotions for such a powerful job.\nNow back to the movie at large again;\nThe editing is absolutely brilliant and takes chances. It's something really fresh and is very effective.\nAll the actors deliver above great performances and the direction is just as great. So is the writing and cinematography. It all works together so well to create a complete result.\nAnd I even think there was enough of humanizing of its characters going on.\nSome people thought there was none of that in here, and that it is just completely on the left side of things, but I disagree. It is not quite that.\nIt surely is very direct and not at all squeamish, but I love that.\nAnd I don't get why so many are offended personally by it. I just don't. That actually seems selfish to me.To put it all into a few last sentences; this is a impressive example of great cinema, that is both relevant, and fresh, at the same time. It also is very thought-provoking and as relevant as it gets. It's almost perfectly executed, but not quite, because it has some scenes in the middle that I thought lacked something. But maybe I will feel differently about that on a second viewing. I can't wait to see it again, oddly enough. Yes, it is a tough watch, and the film so striking, I get that surely not everyone can handle that.\nThough, I'm not saying just becuase you might not like this film you are automatically a dick. Hah. Nope, really not. But Vice definitely works for me... the ideas behind it, the intent, how it was put together... really everything.\nI'm very impressed.",

I was hoping to see an honest depiction of Chaney and what happened during that administration.I expected it a bit brutal, considering the man, and how controversial he was, but this movie is slanted so far to one side, that it was hard to enjoy pretty good acting from most of the cast, but instead it being such an obviously, and blatantly made hack job, instead of a story (good and bad) of the peron it is portraying.If you want a movie that makes fun at pretty much everyone on the Bush administration, then you will love it, if you want a factual movie, that gives the actual facts, without the biased tampering of facts, then stay away from this movie.I which both sides would stop the making of movies attacking political figures at the expense of truthfulness.I also noticed something, though I am not normally very political, I noticed Clint Eastwood (who was always being nominated for golden globes) did not get a nomination, yet Chritian Bale did with a performance not a good as Eastwood...Since Clint attacked Obama, Hollywood has all of a sudden stopped treating him like royalty, While Bale who has not been nominated for anything of substance for a while, got one the moment he took on a part of movie making fun of the right.",

Then saying next to nothing about Carter, Clinton, and all the left doing just about exactly the same things. The acting was great. I'm just not sure why they went so far with things that were completely false, such as Cheney being the man in the room, over Bush. Literally everyone who shared the room with them says make no mistake, Bush was in charge. Just once I'd love a movie to have both points of view met, in the interest of honesty.

            "content": "Four years ago, Adam McKay made one of the most entertaining and educational films about the economy and the explosion of the great American real estate bubble with The big short. With agile and pop culture language, the director simply explained how some broke down and others profited greatly in the American mortgage crisis. In short, there was a bunch of hawks who caught a chance and went hunting. \"Vice\" follows the same model of language, narrative, and premise. The only difference is that it does not have the same humor. Perhaps there is a slight irony here, another there, but it was really impossible to portray the life of what must have been the most active vice president of American history with humor.\"Vice\" is the story of a man who was no one and who became the powerful vice president of George W. Bush's government (2001-2009). The film is pitiless with Dick Cheney (a Christian Bale in a state where there are no adjectives to praise him). In the first part, it portrays Cheney like a failure, alcoholic and mediocre student. In the remainder of the film, Cheney is an opportunist who knew how to ride the sealed horse of history and lead himself to the highest echelons of American government with an extremely conservative thought, without measuring any consequences and trampling whoever he wants to be on the ridge of power. And definitely this portrait could not being different.Cheney was for a long time almost a ghost, but the film compacts with and confirms the hypothesis that he was the iron arm of the Bush administration (Sam Rockwell). It was up to him, with a series of maneuvers and counting on the active participation of coreligionists in various instances of power, to stretch US legislation to the utmost to start groundless wars in Afghanistan and Iraq. All with the consent of a weak and almost servile president to Cheney's wishes and who did all the will to have him side on the plate when running for the presidency with Democrat Al Gore.Narrated by an American soldier, which was a good part of the film, \"Vice\" shows how a mediocre person who had everything to become an irrelevant human being, ended up grabbing an opportunity to do an internship in the US Congress and stuck to right people in power. The first was Donald Rumsfeld (Steve Carrell), Gerald Ford's former chief of staff who also held positions in the Nixon administration and became the Secretary of Defense for the Bush administration.The film gives the impression that Cheney was, in fact, an invisible leader to the public of a whole generation of Republicans and the voice of the American conservatives against the \"advances\" implemented by the Democrats who, by the way, occupied the White House. In the case, since Cheney emerged on the political scene, the only presidents from the democrat party were Jimmy Carter and Bil Clinton, who commanded the White House for 12 years. The Republican presidents were four - Gerald Ford, Ronald Reagan, George Bush and George W. Bush - commanding the White House for a total of 23 years. Barack Obama has come to represent the end of the Cheney generation, now 78 years old. But by then much damage was done.In fact, the peak of Cheney's power was when he held the vice presidency. Cargo that as the film shows, he only accepted after studying on how to turn it from something he considered insignificant to powerful and without any kind of surveillance. At the same time, it demanded then-candidate Bush the right to take care of a number of strategic areas for the American government, such as energy and the military.Cheney saw the opportunity, as the movie jokes, to become a Galactus, the devourer of worlds in Marvel's comic books. This is how he did it. With the conviction that he was doing the right thing, and the best of Bale's performance is the demonstration of this conviction so real and crystal clear, Cheney turned the world into a worse place by starting a war in Afghanistan against Al-Qaeda to hunt down Osama Bin Laden. But the Bush administration's so-called War on Terror was not enough to win the support of the American population. It took a palatable target for the people. A country with borders and a leader.It was in this way that Cheney united the useful to the pleasing, the desire to remove Saddam Hussein from power, and began a war in Iraq with false information and manipulation of news that convinced even the press and the world's leading leaders. In return, what Cheney gained was the direct responsibility for the creation of one of the largest terrorist organizations in the world: the Isis.\"Vice\" is relentless, didactic and has a cast of actors who only brighten the film further. Bale is a monster in the lead role, but Amy Adams is not far behind making Cheney's wife, Lynne. And there are Steve Carrell and Sam Rockwell very well, as well as actors in smaller roles who have successfully incorporated Mckay's idea of storytelling based on connections with pop culture and agile and light language, even though at various times the film get nauseous.In fact, Mckay would be a good history teacher if he did not make movies. And the auto-ironic scene in post-credit is the icing on the cake. In addition to showing how that period helped inaugurate a culture of fake news that prevails today and that helped to choose names like Donald Trump in the United States and Jair Bolsonaro in Brazil.",

This isn't another jaw-dropping, gut-wrenching under-the-carpet look that McKay nailed with the Big Short but rather a flat and 'knew that already' insight on Cheney. AND, despite being a huge fan of the cast - Bale, Carrel & Rockwell, it doesn't deserve to be an Oscar contender.

And even though this movie has been nominated for 8 Academy Awards, it still seems destined to fall short of the top prize, Best Picture.Nevertheless, \"Vice\" deserves a much higher IMDB rating and some definite Oscar love for lead actor (Christian Bale), supporting actress (Amy Adams), director (Adam McKay), original screenplay (Adam McKay) film editor (Hank Corwin) and the makeup and hair team.Dick Cheney (Christian Bale) was the overweight, heart-diseased vice president of the United States who served two terms under president George W. Bush and wielded immense power in his administration before leaving office as one of the most reviled politicians in US history.After bending the knee to his politically ambitious wife Lynne (Amy Adams), Cheney set off on a government career path that began as an unassuming Washington bureaucrat and ended with his being called the most powerful vice president in US history.Along with his film editor, director Adam McKay captures in detail how Cheney seized power during the 9/11 terrorist attacks then fabricated the lies that triggered the US-led coalition which invaded Iraq and allowed American petroleum companies to gain a foothold in the oil rich nation, making him a wealthy man in the process.This revelation of Cheney's ability to use his position as vice president, a political post most Washington insider's regard as a \"nothing job\" to quietly and legally extend his reach into every part of the government to achieve these ends has the same kind of impact movie goers experienced watching \"Spotlight\" (2015), the film that depicted the widespread child molestation in the Boston Catholic Archdiocese and the massive cover-up by the Catholic Church that concealed it from the American public.\"Spotlight\" was chosen Best Picture the following year and while \"Vice\" is unlikely to win the same award, it's social significance in cinematic history is equally undeniable.

Sunday, 03 March.\nAlex DeleonThis is not a review but merely some immediate reactions.\nIn short; over long, drawn out, discombobulated baloney.\nReally boring because the people described in it are all boring from the top down and what they have to say sounds like a college term paper being read aloud. Extremely uninteresting. Full of gimmicks like pretending to end the picture in the middle and running some final credits at that point. Or showing repeated closeups of a beating human heart that looks like a pile of raw liver to underline the fact that the hero is undergoing a heart transplant. Pseudo documentary style with dates and description of events written on screen every ten minutes. But these intertitles are more confusing than enlightening because the entire sequencing of the film is so jumbled and messy.The whole film with ragged time toggling back and forth is very confused, even when you are familiar with the events and the order in which they actually occurred. In Sum: I would have walked out halfway through if I hadn't been with friends. The private bedroom and bathroom life of the central couple, Amy Adams and Christian Bale, is more embarrassing than revealing of their private intimacy. Both are shown in badly lit full screen facial closeups over and over which emphasizes only their dullness. Almost the only memorable scene is when Bale in pajamas does a full throat gargle with mouthwash in the bathroom while vapidly discussing politics with his pajama clad wife. Arguably his most lively scene in the entire flick.\nThis is supposed to be about a Vice president, Dick Cheney, who was so powerful that he relegated the president, George W. Bush, to the background in the wake of 9/11 when we are to believe that he took charge and plunged us into a series of dead end wars. None of this potential power comes across from Bale's listless performance. He emanates weakness, not strength. The characters mulling around in the White House and other government offices got to be so dull that after a while it was a gigantic relief to see Richard Nixon in two brief closeups. His withdrawal from office speech on TV following Watergate actually brought the picture to life for a few seconds, which isn't saying much. One plus. Every scene that Sam Rockwell was in playing president George Bush Jr. was more or less watchable. The facial similarity was there and Rockwell played rings around Bale every time he was on.\nAll in all an overweaning pretentious muddled mess that made me heave a sigh of relief when it was finally over after several phoney half baked false alarm endings. Much is made of Cheney's life long hobby of angle fishing and at the end we see a rather pretty sequence of colorful angling hooks and flies as if this were the secret key to Cheney's colorless personality, like the Rosebud sled at the end of Citizen Kane. But Citizen Cheney is at least a light year away from Citizen Charles Foster Kane.",

With that though, one would be cautious to accept everything presented in the movie as factually accurate, as much of the dialog that occurs between characters and the situations they engage in cannot be dependably verified. It is an entertaining movie however, and one I enjoyed well enough if you can hold your ideological convictions in check. Cheney could have been presented entirely as a villain, so it was noteworthy to see those instances of love and compassion he displayed as a family man, particularly when daughter Mary (Alison Pill) came out as a lesbian. The supporting players were well cast as well; Steve Carrell as Donald Rumsfeld was almost as spot-on as Bale was, and LisaGay Hamilton bore an amazing likeness to Condoleeza Rice. I didn't get the impression overall that the movie was made as satire or as comedy, but I do have to say that Sam Rockwell's take on George W. Bush bore all the earmarks of a Saturday Night Live skit. So as for those scenes with him in it went, it didn't take much to realize that the film's intent was as agenda driven as they come. But no matter, for a political movie I was willing enough to take the politics out of it as much as I could to appreciate the performances, and in a nutshell, they were all pretty good.",

It is interesting to note the attention which the film devotes to Cheney's poor heart condition and his resolve to survive and rule the roost - in a heartless way, thinking nothing of the impact that his actions might have on Iraqis or even US citizens.Steve Carell is also impressive as Rumsfeld, initially Cheney's superior, but his not too accepting subordinate by movie's end.Great direction, competent photography, and a quite interesting script keep VICE ticking over and make it must-see stuff.",

This is not a VO, as you see him clearly but just wonder who the hell he is. SPOILER here: when it gets to the revelation at the end, those who have see \"21 grams\" (2003) will undoubtedly be reminded of that movie.Even before the title and opening credits are shown, there are montages aplenty: haunting images of 911, air strikes at Iran, a young Lynne Vincent (Amy Adams) goading Dick Cheney (Christian Bale) on with barbs like \"I picked the wrong man\", \"Prove it!\" etc. This pre-title sequence closed with, against a black screen, printed words from an anonymous quote \"Beware of a quiet man\" purportedly prophesising Chaney's life.The early part of the movie is something like a concise history of recent American presidency. Cheney's destiny starts with an internship program run by Donald Rumsfeld (an unreservedly charismatic Steve Carell) who losses no time in emphasizing the requirement of absolute \"loyalty\". The fun starts with the resignation of Nixon (from news footage, as a few later historic events). Serving as chief of staff to Ford looks promising for Cheney. But just as he is having fun with developing the \"Unitary Executive Theory\", his political prospects come to an abrupt end when Ford losses to Carter. Back home hatching more schemes, the couple works hard, as exemplified in Lynne intimating in one of her speeches that while women in New York are burning their bras, in Wyoming here, \"we wear them\".Opportunity knocks again when under the \"revolution of the rich\", Regan comes into power, vowing that \"we'll make American great again\" (sounds familiar? Copycats are a dime a dozen).Then comes the real stuff. \"Dubya\", showing that he does have shrewd moments, seeks out Cheney as running mate. The wooing scene in George Bush's office is classic. Sam Rockwell, fresh from his Oscar win last year, displays virtuosity in his own interpretation of Bush that is quite different from Josh Brolin's in \"W.\" (2008). Brolin went for melodrama and portrayed a Bubya that you could almost love. Rockwell goes for the pragmatic and gives us a Bush that has a lot of common sense. Neither succumb to the screen stereotype of an idiotic Bush. That is good. Apologies for getting carried away. This movie is about Cheney, not Bush. Incidentally, in \"W.\", Cheney is played by Richard Dreyfuss.Anyway, back to the remainder of \"Vice\", which I could easily and lazily take care of as \"and the rest is history\". And so it is. The most familiar part is of course how the 911 attack gave Cheney an opportunity to strengthen his power and control over everything. One particularly symbolic scene occurs in a heated discussion with a group of seven or eight people. Strategically, Cheney moves to stand before the seated Bush, virtually shielding him from the sight of everybody else in the room, and utters through his teeth \"You are the president\". Needless to say, Bush takes the cue.Not particularly a flash of genius but still very clever is using as background music for the ending credits \"America\" from \"West Side Story\".\nIt remains to be seen if Bale can repeat Gary Oldman's feat with \"The darkest hour\" last year. If he does, considerable of credit goes to the makeup artist.",

Having recently directed the acclaimed film The Big Short, his comedy met his drama and formed a mesh that a lot of viewers loved. Personally, I wasn't a huge fan of his previous film, so I was a little hesitant on Vice. With that said, Vice is surprisingly one of the best movies that 2018 had to offer. I love when biopics have the freedom of not taking itself too seriously. Yes, there are some very touchy subjects sprinkled throughout the course of this movie, but I had a blast watching it. Aside from awards shows, I don't hear many people talking about this movie, which is a shame, because it's fantastic.Maybe I just wasn't all that invested in politics enough to know this story, but I found myself very surprised throughout the course of this movie, mainly due to the core focus on Dick Cheney. Vice follows Cheney's rise to power in a very quiet fashion. Having never once been elected President of the United States, his impact on the government was huge. Being an insider who went from bringing people coffee to pretty much running the show for George W. Bush during his Presidency, this story was ripe for exploration. George W. Bush felt obligated to run for President, which in turn made him need a knowledgeable and ambitious person to help him along the way. There are many ways this story could've fallen apart as a feature film, but due to the talent involved, Vice is one of the best of the year.From Christian Bale delivering a stellar, dedicated performance as always, to Sam Rockwell delivering an offbeat and likable performance as George W. Bush, to the likes of Amy Adams and Steve Carell who've always been likable, Vice is littered with terrific performances. Those performances are expected by these people, but I do believe Adam McKay has something to do with that. Whether it's in his older comedies or his recent dramas, he knows where each of his performer's strengths are and showcases them first and foremost. Even in the slower moments of the film, I found myself incredibly engaged, due to the fact that these performances felt so real. Not only do these performances make this a better film, but this is a screenplay that impressed me quite a bit as well.Having also been written by Adam McKay, he clearly knew the story he wanted to tell from start to finish. He chose the most interesting period in Dick Cheney's life and went with it. From incredibly weird and interesting choices in terms of where the story starts and stops throughout the course of the movie, I was kind of amazed at how a few scenes didn't crash and burn. Some audiences may find certain choices very strange, but I thought they were experiments that paid off. I can't wait to see what he comes up with as his next project.In the end, Vice is the kind of film that would jump at the opportunity to be nominated for numerous awards, but it's also one that deserves the recognition it's receiving. Many of the critics seem to be mixed on this particular film, but that actually shocks me. From weird (in a good way) editing choices to bizarre songs choices, Vice is a movie that meshes a lot of elements together to form a film that feels more like an experiment than a finished product, but that experiment just worked for me in nearly every way. I loved watching Vice and I highly recommend it.",

The film highlights the pitfalls of the democratic process such that Cheney uses his guile and phenomenal power to interpret the law and the constitution to suit his own belief in what the country needed. It is acknowledged at the beginning of the film that he was extremely secretive and that much of what is shown is speculative. It makes however for a scary journey through what is possible within the US political system backed up by fine performances by Bale, Carrell as Donald Rumsfeld, but particular Amy Adams as his powerful and influential wife.It is though a sometimes strange rather cold experience, feeling like a PBS documentary with drama added in for effect supported by occasional rather bizarre imagery to push the message home.Wait for the hilarious post credit sequence.",

            "content": "Adam McKay has had quite the career; from his early days with Will Ferrell and co. in Anchorman to the Oscar-winning political biopic The Big Short, McKay's flare for both comedy and drama sets the standards high for his latest film, Vice.Christian Bale stars as the alarmingly ruthless bureaucratic Washington insider, Dick Cheney. His unassuming personality may otherwise never warrant a second glance, but behind the scenes Cheney schemes his way up the political ladder to wield enormous power, eventually as Vice-President to George W. Bush's administration, becoming what most assert to be the most influential 'vice' the world has ever seen. Yet, while this film never fails to provoke, the tone often makes it a rather tedious watch.Vice opens by stating that the quietest person in the room is often the smartest. McKay then continues to scream at the audience how intelligent this film is, and it just doesn't work. His directing style here, though successful in creating an incredibly unnerving atmosphere, doesn't fit securely with the overarching narrative. The consistent sub-story fourth wall breaking seems rather engaging at the start, but proceeds to only distract from the main plot, confusing the tone throughout the whole film until a last-minute twist ties it all together rather unsatisfyingly. The awkward style makes it extremely difficult for McKay to make an actual point besides the blatant emotional force against the actions of this ignominious administration, which is a true let-down for the stellar cast of this feature.Once again, Christian Bale provides a brilliant all-out performance as the film's lead. Convincingly characterising the cold bureaucrat, Bale is chillingly good in this position amongst some of Washington's most despicable schemers. McKay invests a lot of time trying to get close to Cheney, and Bale makes this, for the most part, possible.However, Vice attempts to make Cheney a much more complicated character than necessary in order to stretch its appeal to the masses. Bale attacks this head-on though, and makes up for over-dramatization with a persuasive display, making the character believable and at times, dare it be said, compelling.He is supported by superb performances by the ever-consistent Amy Adams, another hit outing from Steve Carrell, and a disturbingly concise portrayal of George W. Bush by Sam Rockwell. Regardless of the aforementioned issues with the tone, it is true that Vice always feels committed to telling this story with integrity.And it is indeed a very interesting story. Though it may be hard to connect with at times as a result of the film's clunky vibe, it can be very witty in its approach. Sharp with its humour yet bleak in its message, the collision between these two means it's never unclear what the film is trying to achieve; its unsettling, it's disturbing, much like the atmosphere of the time in the country's history.Yet, overall, Vice is as disturbing as it is confusing. McKay provides another provoking political biopic but fails to accomplish the benchmarks of filmmaking he has demonstrated he is capable of in the past.",

            "content": "I've come to the conclusion that me and Adam McKay just aren't ever going to get along. We're not, we are incompatible. His dramatic efforts consistently fall short, with 'The Big Short' being a tolerable piece of drama. Yet here we are with a biopic on Dick Cheney and how he rapidly became more and more powerful as he climbed up the governmental hierarchy. And much to my dismay (because I'll save you reading the rest of this review), I hated this.There was a \"comedic\" scene halfway through where the film playfully ends abruptly by rolling the credits, and I found my blood physically boil. I started to sweat and breathe extremely heavily through frustration. It was at the moment, I found myself irritated by Vice. McKay undoubtedly was the wrong director for this biopic. The visual distractions, fourth wall breaks, onscreen annotations and constant narration detracted from what could've been a superior drama. McKay having wrote the screenplay, who's background mostly consist of comedies, was unable to solidify the narrative's tone. For example, when Cheney persuades president Bush to invade Iraq, the proceeding scene is a montage of war-torn clips accompanied by a booming classical number. McKay believes this to be powerful, but actually it comes across as pretentious. This entire biopic is so large in scope, yet every aspect of Cheney's life was underdeveloped and unsurprisingly dull. It almost felt like a dramatisation of Cheney's Wikipedia page. The constant \"witty\" narration that explains every flippin' political term and individual as if we know absolutely nothing. A biopic should be informative enough to allow the people to be engrossing. Vice just spews jargon from every direction, to a point where I thought I needed to bring a notepad. Its ferocity just makes the film forgettable and far too clinical.Then we come to the treatment of Cheney and the viewpoint that McKay wanted to share. Throughout the entire film, it is heavily implied by Plemons' narration and McKay's introductory montage on how the world is now doomed, that Cheney is a bad individual. Every selfish action he took was just to improve his chances of becoming president. But, this is all diminished during the final scene when Cheney breaks the fourth wall and talks to us unintelligent viewers and spouts something like \"You may hate me. But I did everything for my country. I protected the people I love.\". Why? When you've spent over two hours depicting this individual to be a monster that you then decide to sit on the moral fence and leave the audience to decide if he was bad or good. That just sums up McKay in my opinion. Someone who needs to get off his high horse and stick to one tone, perspective and direction.It completely frustrates me that a film like this falls short, when the performances are so brilliant. Bale, in all his method acting glory, packs on the pounds and transforms himself to become Cheney. He was outstanding. His voice, mannerisms and physicality were the perfect imitations of Cheney. Adams yet again gives a solid performance to which she will not win any awards (one day though...). Carell and Rockwell were decent, although did not have enough screen time to make a big enough impact. I would even go as far as saying there were various scenes, particularly after the methodically dull first half, that nearly captivated me. The outside meeting where Bush is chomping on chicken and Cheney is using his power of persuasion was a glimpse of excellence. But McKay wastes his cast for annoying gimmicks, uninspired direction and unimaginative storytelling that nearly made me walk out of the cinema. Such a waste!",

Breaking the 4th wall. Using shakespeare to make comparisons. At one point a dialogue with Cheney and Bush was interlaced with a fly fishing scene to make the point that Cheney was only baiting Bush for giving the Vice President more power.This is an offensive film if you're a republican.

            "content": "The political thriller is a very delicate art, the line between civil scrutiny and populist antagonism, public accusation and personal insult, good intentions and variable outcomes being thin indeed. This dilemma is perhaps best exemplified by the work of Greek-French director Konstantinos Costa-Gravas, who all but defined the genre starting in the early 70s, mostly end up shot by both sides: the right accused him of bringing subversive ideas to good ole\u00b4 entertainment, the left of disparaging important issues with Hollywood formulas. A dilemma on which, reviewing Vice, The MacMahonian will now expand.Vice is the 8th feature film directed by Adam McKay, author of low comedies, viz the Anchorman series, who got serious in 2015 with his previous effort The Big Short, which sought to denounce the iniquities of bank and stock exchange regulation shenanigans leading up to the 2008 financial crisis.Vice tells the unvarnished, unflattering, and unverifiable story of the rise and rise of Dick Cheney (Christian Bale, inflated to greatness on what seems to be his quest to become the Lon Chaney of the 21st Century), reputedly the most powerful Vice-President in US history, according to the film by virtue of an understanding to that effect with President George W Bush, portrayed here (by Sam Rockwell, to the T) as a political lightweight pliable to the Machiavellian manipulations of Cheney and Donald Rumsfeld (Steve Carrell, ditto). The film flashes back and forth through the personal life and political career of Cheney, shown as an unscrupulous, intellectually mediocre deadpan schemer whose political ambition was fuelled by a mixture of alcoholism, spouse pressure and overcompensation for precarious vascular health, joining hands with like-hearted and minded Rumsfeld to make US foreign policy the instrument of big oil and big business interests, the rest being contemporary history.Vice falls squarely, if belatedly, in the Farenheit 9/11 (Michael Moore, 2004) tradition of well-meaning if unevenly engaging films denouncing the sub-prime crisis and/or the Second Iraq War and their fallout. 15 years on, whatever else you might say about it, one thing this school of film making did not accomplish was to prevent Donald Trump from entering the White House.If anybody sleeps easier if they think the world would be a better place if the likes Dick Cheney or Donald Rumsfeld weren't such scumbags, it's their privilege, but it's also our problem. Trying to address it is far beyond the direct purview of The MacMahonian, so let us concentrate on Vice's cinematic merits: lively and effective, if, or perhaps because, Manichean, the film left me thinking if Adam McKay, who also wrote the script, were to be tasked to do the same for House of Cards (full disclosure: I watched about 20 minutes of the first episode, found it lame and pretentiously silly, and fell asleep) it might have been a much better series.",

            "content": "There was great imagination in turning a tragic moment of American history into a mordant satire. The writer-director of \"Vice\" has a background in writing for \"Saturday Night Live,\" and he never lacked for comic ideas. But a curious point described in the bonus track of the DVD was that the actors seemed to be approaching their roles like method actors, internalizing their roles to capture the essence of real people. The result was a discordant style in which the serious historical events apppeared to be trivialized.The film was successful in compressing the lives of Dick and Lynne Cheney in an epic story. We follow their lives over the course of decades in American government. The goal was to depict Dick Cheney as a \"quiet man,\" who worms his way into the halls of power through the legalistic concept of \"unitary executive theory,\" which the film claims was the brainchild of Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia. Another way of looking at his rise to power was that he was a cunning, ambitious political operative.There was clearly some good research apparent in the film with details about such key figures as Donald Rumsfeld, Colin Powell, the two Bush presidents, and an array of other historical figures. But the focus is clearly on the two Cheneys and their ruthless tactics in acquiring and using power. At one point, the filmmakers created dialogue that resonated of Shakespeare with Lynne and Dick doing their best imitations of Mr. and Mrs. Macbeth. Like many of the scenes in this film, the Shakespearean sequence didn't work.The major shortcoming to this film was the over-the-top comedy. In places, the style was so excessive that the genuine tragedy of the response to the tragic events of September 11, 2001, was lost. The bonus track of the DVD includes a deleted scene that was a musical, filled with kick-dancing choreography and a dazzling diva, depicting Dick Cheney and Don Rumsfeld in the Congressional cafeteria.But the devastating effects of American policy decisions on the nation and the world from the George W. Bush administration were undercut by the comedy. Good satire should expose social ills. But, in \"Vice,\" the comedy never fully meshed with the realism. The actors and production personnel seemed to be having a jolly time in making film. But, for the audience, it all just seemed in bad taste, considering the film's subject matter. In other words, this film was a long, strung out SNL program.",

            "content": "The title really should have just been \"Dick\", as it would have done everything that McKay wanted to accomplish with the piece right upfront. In any case, this brazen biopic has no qualms with its overall opinion of Cheney - or, at least, his political actions. 'Vice (2018)' initially starts off as a messy and more traditional 'life story', masking its liberal use of exposition with its distinctly brash and otherwise distracting style. After the halfway point, however, the piece morphs into something slightly different, to the point that the affair feels as though it could be split into two relatively distinct halves: before and after our lead becomes Bush's vice president. This second half is much more interesting as it highlights all the shady stuff that Cheney did both with his power and to further solidify it. Here, the flick introduces the same sort of 'insider insight' that McKay's 'The Big Short (2015)' did, allowing for some shocking, frustrating and, even, harrowing moments. Yet, even at its most interesting, the picture still suffers from a sense that it doesn't quite know what it is. It straddles the line between straight-forward 'real life' retelling and satirical, 'take no prisoners'-style take-down. This even extends to the way in which Cheney himself isn't presented as a cartoon character, or even as a caricature. He's actually quite nuanced, if clearly flawed. Though the movie is obviously opposed to his methods, it also gives him a fairly fair shake, especially when it gives him a final monologue that allows him to share his perspective on things; even if this is exaggerated, it's not exactly unfair and slightly undermines the occasionally sardonic tone that it has built up in its crescendo. It's its sparring tone that perhaps causes the most problems, tied only with the overt exposition that sometimes makes it seem as though we, the audience, are being treated as less than intelligent - though, it's not like we're ever talked down to, just told instead of shown. The end result is an experience that's often entertaining, in its own way. It puts its own spin on things but still appears to remain truthful, trying to push its message while still keeping its integrity. In the process, though, one of those things might just get ever-so-slightly diluted. Still, while it often swings for the fences and misses just as many times as it hits, it's an above-average entry into this genre that's worth a watch if you're into American politics - especially if you're liberal. 6/10",

            "content": "So I saw Vice at the theater. I would be lying if I said I wasn't looking forward to this movie. Adam McKay took on Wall Street's corruption in the Big Short and Vice looked like a similar approach to a controversial figure like Dick Cheney. Plus how could I not be excited about Christian Bale? Overall I loved the movie! It was everything I expected and more. I will say I completely understand why this is a polarizing film. It is one of the most overtly political and message driven films I've seen in a long time.Of course the story follows the near Shakespearean tale of Dick Cheney's rise and fall in power. With the use of an omnipresent narrator the movie shows his early days before Washington and slowly works its way up as he rises in authority and power by any means necessary. Of course the culmination of the film being his role as arguably the most powerful vice president in history. The movie was completely dialogue and character-driven in every way. All the while the movie provided a wickedly smart and biting satire on politics that had me constantly laughing and entertained.I would hope everyone is familiar with Dick Cheney and most of the political figures and events depicted in the movie. If not please do yourself a favor as this movie is not a biographical take on Dick Cheney and politics. It is political satire that uses the truth while also embellishing for effect. Anyone looking for a straight political biographical film will most certainly be disappointed. With the same regard, being familiar with the events and real characters really helps the satirical depiction and humor come through. Those looking for a neutral stance political drama or a straight comedy should look elsewhere. The movie will certainly disappoint if you judge it for being something it never tried to be.I absolutely loved how smart the film was. The movie used Dick Cheney as a vehicle to look at the changes that occurred in our political and socio-economic system over time. The movie also acts as a backdrop to the rise in modern neoconservatism. The film directly criticizes the manufactured consent fostered by partisan ideology driven news outlets and just how they have negatively impacted society. It also looks at the corporate and wealthy takeover over of our political mechanisms and just how those changes occurred. It is an overtly political message that is certain to divide viewers along political boundaries.Like the best political satires the film also acts as a parallel to our current political problems. While the film discusses Dick Cheney and the Bush Administration it also firmly has its targets on the rise of Donald Trump and the partisan agenda observed in politics. Again, this movie clearly has a message and agenda. It It not pretending to be a subtle and nuanced depiction of political discourse. It is a chainsaw approach that points out how individuals like Dick Cheney can come to power.Directing wise I was thoroughly impressed by Adam McKay. The movie utilized a number of storytelling techniques that all worked quite well. There were 4th wall breaking moments reminiscent of House of Cards, flash forward and backward moments, and false endings that were handled quite nicely. I never felt the movie or plot progression was jarring in any way. The movie also utilized an omnipresent narrator who spoke directly towards the audience and pushed the plot forward. It's a technique utilized morso in theater, but it worked very well over the course of the film as well.Of course Christian Bale was phenomenal. Political message aside it is impossible not to recognize his ability in the film. He played Dick Cheney perfectly. He captured every mannerism and expression plus his physical transformation was astounding. He really threw himself into this performance and portrayed a flawed and unlikable character that a lesser actor would have bombed in. He certainly deserves praise for what may be the best male lead performance of 2018.Amy Adams was the other constant actor throughout the film and she was incredible. She has been impressive over the years and Vice was certainly no exception. She has such a great range and really emotes with her character's conflicts. Her performance as Lynne Cheney served to humanize Dick Cheney through most of the film, but she also Illustrated the pervasive and corrupting role power has on the human psyche. I could easily see her getting nominated for her role.I cannot say enough about the acting in this movie. It simply has one of the best ensemble performances of 2018. While the meat of the film is anchored firmly by the performances of Christian Bale and Amy Adams, there were also a number of incredibly entertaining and well acted secondary characters that deserve credit. Sam Rockwell playing George Bush was perfect. He absolutely nailed Bush's mannerisms and talking patterns. Steve Carell deserves some respect as Donald Rumsfeld and I'm always happy to see Jesse Plemons.Vice is one of my favorite movies of 2018. I absolutely loved the movie, but it certainly isn't perfect and is guaranteed to polarize. For starters the movie had some glaring pacing issues. There was at least 15 to 20 minutes that could have been cut out of the movie to speed up the narrative. Adam McKay's throw everything at the wall and see what sticks approach doesn't always pan out in the movie. The movie indulges a little bit too much in the experimental and unorthodox for its storytelling devices. Plus the last 20 minutes of the film really felt a bit unnecessary to the central narrative. It seems the film didn't know quite where to end its story. Editing certainly was lacking throughout the film, a problem very much found in Big Short as well.The movie at times also becomes too rabid in portraying its message at the expense of the audience. I agree with the movie, but the sledgehammer approach can be overwhelming at times. The movie certainly pushed some people away with its brutal and stark depictions of neoconservatism.The movie doesn't exactly have well-developed or rounded characters either. I thoroughly enjoyed the acting, but the characters feel more like caricatures being used to push Adam McKay's narrative. That of course being a component of the film being a satire so it was by design, but it becomes complicated considering the film is based on historical events and people. I mean they literally show Dick Cheney having a black heart.Vice is destined to be a polarizing film. It is a smart and well written satire that uses Dick Cheney to illustrate a number of problems our political system. The acting was incredible and if nothing else everyone should watch the movie for that reason. Of course this is by no means a fair or balanced depiction of historical figures, but it was never trying to be. Plus who exactly is defending Dick Cheney? I thought we all agreed he wasn't exactly a nice guy. A 8.75 out of 10.",

            "content": "It starts with the title. Of course all movies do. But Vice has a particularly clever one. You think it just means it's a biopic of a former Vice President. Well, I that's what I thought anyway. And it is. But even more so it is about vice - moral depravity and wickedness. It's a story of a lowlife gradually snaking his way up to the point of becoming the most powerful person in the country. But what makes Vice really powerful is the way it shows the seeds of our current nightmare being planted and cultivated starting back in the 70s. It's very scary, scarier than a horror flick. Because the monsters are real and the contagion has spread and everyone knows somebody who is infected. There are a few moments that felt false, like the one about Valerie Plame. Or the scene at the restaurant where the characters who were always presented in situations rooted firmly in reality suddenly found themselves in an openly symbolic one. But for the most part the film flows organically between scenes that involve actors, the archival footage, and the narration that intentionally breaks the fourth wall (super clever choice of the narrator too). The casting and acting is impeccable. Every character came across as real and while many are played by known actors, it doesn't distract from seeing them as the equally known political figures they portray. From Justin Kirk as Scooter Libby and Eddie Marsan as Paul Wolfowitz to Tyler Perry who is wonderful as Colin Powell and Sam Rockwell rocking it as a very human (and possibly too innocent) George W. Bush. The only one I had trouble with was Steve Carell - I kept seeing him rather than John Ashcroft. Amy Adams as Lynne Cheney is unlike I've ever seen her before. And of course there's Christian Bale. It's crazy how you can still see him in the young Cheney, but as he gets older, Bale disappears completely, becoming virtually identical to the man he is playing. My only problem was that it seems unclear how Cheney went from an embecile to someone so clever and so evil. And for the evil the question is also - why? Money? Power? I would have liked to see some kind of human motivation.",

            "content": "I saw the trailer and images of the leading actor playing the well-known American politician and businessman, he was almost completely unrecognisable and a spitting image of the real man, I became much more keen to see it when it became part of Awards Season, from Oscar, BAFTA and Golden Globe nominated writer and director Adam McKay (Anchorman: The Legend of Ron Burgundy, Talladega Nights: The Ballad of Ricky Bobby, The Big Short). Basically in 1963 Wyoming, Dick Cheney (Golden Globe winning, and Oscar and BAFTA nominated Christian Bale) was working as a lineman after his struggles with alcohol led him to drop out of Yale University. His wife Lynne (Oscar, BAFTA and Golden Globe nominated Amy Adams) convinces him to get himself clean, after he is arrested for driving while intoxicated, and in 1969 he finds work as a White House intern during the Nixon Administration. Working under Nixon's economic adviser, Donald Rumsfeld (Steve Carell), Cheney becomes a savvy political operative. He discovers the true power of the executive branch after overhearing a conversation between Henry Kissinger (Kirk Bovill) and President Richard Nixon discussing the secret bombing of Cambodia. Rumsfeld's abrasive attitude leads to him and Cheney being distanced from Nixon, which works in both men's favours following Nixon's resignation, Cheney becomes White House Chief of Staff for President Gerald Ford (Bill Camp) while Rumsfeld becomes Secretary of Defense. After Ford is voted out of office, Cheney gives an awkward and uncharismatic campaign speech as he runs to be representative for Wyoming, and he suffers his first heart attack. Lynne campaigns on her husband's behalf while he recovers, helping him to win a seat in the U.S. House of Representatives. During the Presidency of Ronald Reagan, Cheney supports a raft of conservative, pro-business policies favouring the fossil fuel industries. Cheney next serves as Secretary of Defense under President George H. W. Bush (John Hillner) during the Gulf War. Outside of politics, Cheney and Lynne accept their youngest daughter Mary (Alison Pill) coming out as a lesbian. Though Cheney develops ambitions to run for president, he decides to retire from public life to spare Mary from media scrutiny. During the presidency of Bill Clinton, Cheney becomes the CEO of Halliburton while his wife raises golden retrievers and writes books, a false epilogue claims that Cheney lived the rest of his life healthy and happy and credits begin rolling, only for the film to continue following Cheney receiving a phone call. Cheney is invited to become running mate to George W. Bush (Oscar, BAFTA and Golden Globe nominated Sam Rockwell) during the 2000 United States presidential election. Cheney recognises the younger Bush is more interested in pleasing his father than attaining power, he agrees under the condition that he given \"mundane\" executive responsibilities. Cheney becomes Vice President, working alongside Secretary of Defense Rumsfeld, legal counsel David Addington (Don McManus), and the Chief of Staff, Scooter Libby (Justin Kirk), to exercise control of key foreign policy and defense decisions throughout Washington. When the September 11 attacks occur in 2001, Cheney and Rumsfeld respond and maneuver to initiate U.S. invasions of Afghanistan and Iraq, resulting in many civilian deaths and the torture of prisoners. As the War on Terror mounts, Cheney continues to struggle with persistent heart attacks, other events covered include his endorsement of the Unitary executive theory, the Plame affair, the accidental shooting of Harry Whittington, and tensions between the Cheney sisters over same-sex marriage. Cheney's actions that lead to thousands of deaths and the rise of the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant result in him receiving record-low approval ratings by the end of the Bush administration. Cheney needs an emergency heart transplant operation, Kurt (Jesse Plemons), who is narrating the story, is a veteran of the Afghanistan and Iraq Wars, he is killed in a motor accident while jogging, his healthy heart is transplanted into Cheney in 2012. A few months later, Cheney's daughter Liz (Lily Rabe) runs for a Senate seat in Wyoming, but Mary is left angry and upset as she is opposed to same-sex marriage, she later wins the election and steps into hr father's former Congressional position. At the end of the film, an irate Cheney breaks the fourth wall and delivers a monologue to the audience, stating that he has no regrets about anything he has done in his career. Also starring Eddie Marsan as Paul Wolfowitz, LisaGay Hamilton as Condoleezza Rice, Shea Whigham as Wayne Vincent, Tyler Perry as Colin Powell, Alex Kingi as Osama Bin Laden, Alfred Molina as Waiter and Naomi Watts as News Anchor. Bale gives a superb performance as the real-life public figure who is charismatic but cold and silently menacing, and there is fantastic support from Carell being blunt and abrasive, Rockwell as the simplistic Bush, and Adams as the supportive wife. I'm not going to pretend I understood everything going on, I know little about politics, but I recognised key events, and it wasn't boring, with the many cinematic gimmicks to tell the story, and the humour does work, an interesting political comedy drama. It won the Oscar for Best Makeup and Hairstyling, and it was nominated for Best Motion Picture of the Year, Best Original Screenplay for Adam McKay and Best Film Editing, it won the BAFTA for Best Editing, and it was nominated for Best Original Screenplay and Best Make Up/Hair, and it was nominated the Golden Globes for Best Screenplay and Best Motion Picture - Musical or Comedy.

All of this was done in such a forced and ham-handed way - like superimposing children and mothers who would be killed in the Vietnam bombings he approved - as if Cheney's goal was to bomb women and children. Sorry, Cheney is no Hitler, he deserved a deeper character analysis. I could go on and on. If you hated Bush-Cheney, I'm sure you'll love this movie.

Adam Mckay continues a very intriguing story-telling style as seen in The Big Short (also featuring both Bale and Carell) that kept me engaged for the entire run time. His ability to take the little tendencies and mannerisms of each character and blow it out of proportion for humorous purposes was genius. For example, the Bedroom Scene between Lynne and Dick and the restaurant scene with a nice cameo from Alfred Molina. It was a fast paced story that covered a lot about the mans life. And then the third act hits... When showing the time of Cheney actually in office, the story seemed to be a bit cluttered. It did a poor job of showing how time had passed once he accepted the Vice Presidency from George W. Bush. Other than that I absolutely love Mckay's story telling style, I can see how it might be a bit much for some and that may be off putting but if you love the way The Big Short was filmed you'll like this. Even though once again The Big Short is the better movie and isn't as over-the-top as this movie.The acting. Oh, the acting. Bale proves once again that he is not only one of the best actors working today but one of the best actors of all-time. Personally, will be a close draw with Bradley Cooper for best actor in a leading role (Rami Malek right behind them). He escapes into the role as Cheney and delivers one of his best performances. Everyone was trying to figure out how Leo hadn't gotten an Oscar until he finally got one in the Revenant in 2016. I'm trying to figure out how Amy Adams hasn't gotten one (5 time Oscar Nominee). She has always been one of my favorites and from the other supporting actresses I've seen in other films this year, she has the Oscar on lock down this year. Her ability to both command a scene and add onto Bale's performance was nothing short of perfect. Steve Carrell was also a big stand out to me as Donald Rumsfeld. He continues to prove that he has the widest range of any actor working today.Now remember, this review is setting aside politics. For those of you truly wondering , it does paint Cheney as a \"heartless\" person (near the end of the movie it pretty much blames him for any bad thing that has ever happened in America after his service in office was over). The movie is worth a watch though due to the performances, story-telling style and witty humor that supports the characters. 8/10, B-.",

The Democrats then pulled out our troops which led to the murder of 2 million citizens.\nCarter was the most ineffective president possibly ever.

Theft is immoral.\nNo mention of Al Gore and his nonsense about how we would all be underwater by now if we didn't stop carbon emissions. No mention of how Clinton did nothing when Al Qaeda bombed the WTC the first time, and USS Cole bombing.\nNot one drop of oil was taken from Iraq by US oil companies. No mention of how Obama called in 100X the number of airstrikes as Bush/Cheney.\nThen they actually have the gall to splice in Stoneman Douglas, Trump supporters, and Illegal alien children being held in cages at the border.\nThen they try to pin ISIS deaths on Cheney....even though ISIS came to power because Obama pulled US troops out of Iraq, and then did nothing to stop the rise of ISIS for 8 years.

A lot of the events are really obvious to the average viewer so I don't think this film really \"exposed\" anything unless the viewer was too young when it happened.",

That is brilliantly shown in this movie that tells us about the former vice-presudent of USA Dick Cheney's career whose influence on American policy was very important and effective.

There were a number of cameos and the final focus group after the credits was an interesting addition .The film is definitely worth seeing it's not the best biopic you'll ever see , it's not best satire you'll ever see but it's worth seeing for Christian Bale's believable performance.Pad.A 8/10",

The Director did a superb job in manipulating these extraordinary actors that brought this film to fife.Further, the screenplay itself was faultless while the film was able to follow the elaborate directions from Director, Adam McKay. All of the actors were as good as their string of award nominations have proven.My overriding distaste for the actions of these political monsters that were so well orchestrated by the people that made this marvellous film in no way detracts from the merits of this.

His life was very secretive, but this movie tells the story from his rise to power in the government to his role as vice president from as much as the filmmakers could gather.This movie was pretty surprising actually. It takes itself the right amount of seriously and is self-aware. It pokes fun at itself sometimes and I had some laughs when it was doing so. For the most part I think it does do a good job at looking at Cheney's history considering how limited our information on him is. What's especially nice about this movie however is that it feels completely neutral in terms of political standpoints. This movie both paints Cheney as a tyrannical jerk, which gives off a feeling of this being left-wing and paints him with a heart as well, which gives off a right-wing feel. I'm really impressed with the fact that the movie feels completely neutral in this regard. If it went in either direction, it probably wouldn't be as enjoyable.Christian Bale did a great job as Cheney as well. It's clear that he had to study Cheney's attitude, and the make-up job was also really well-done. It's so good that I had a hard time determining whether or not that was actually Christian Bale or not. It makes him physically look like a different person and I have to give major props to them.I do think this movie has a very noteworthy flaw however. For one, it uses footage from other sources rather frequently, which somewhat paints the movie in a documentary style. I don't think this was a good choice because it can be seen as alienating to those who don't want to watch a documentary. To improve this issue, I think it would be best to get people to act out said scenes.Either way, if anyone's interested in a biopic about famous politicians, this is one I recommend. It's unbiased, self-aware and showcases great performances from its lead actors despite my major flaw with it.7/10",

            "content": "\"Vice\" (2018 release; 135 min.) is a political bio-pic about Dick Cheney. As the movie opens, we are in \"Caspar, Wyoming, 1963\", and Cheney is pulled over by a cop for drunk driving. We then flash forward to \"The White House, September 9, 2001\", as Cheney and other officials are responding to the 9/11 attacks, and Cheney is in apparent control (remember that W. was visiting a school in Florida at the time). We then go back to 1963, when Cheney is kicked out by Yale University, then arrested in Wyoming for another DUI, and his girlfriend/wife-to-be Lynne reads him the riot act to get his life together, and quickly. At this point we're 10 min. into the movie but to tell you more of the plot would spoil your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.Couple of comments: this is the latest movie from long-time comedy writer and director Adam McKay, who made his directing debut with \"Anchorman\" and just recently gave us the brilliant \"The Big Short\". Here he decides to go the political tour, and gives us a portrait of Dick Cheney. I wonder whether the movie's title refers to Cheney's many vices (yes, many indeed), or whether it refers to his 8 year Vice Presidency under George W. Bush. If you've seen the movie's trailer, the clear impression is that the movie is mostly about that 8 year Vice Presidency (when in reality it is only half of the movie), and furthermore that W. was just a bumbling idiot and Cheney was really in charge all along. Was this so? Who knows. Is this a comedy? Or a drama? or both? Christian Bale is unrecognizable (and utterly brilliant) as Dick Cheney. Amy Adams is equally great as Dick's equally conniving wife Lynne. Steve Carell also is spot-on as Donald Rumsfeld. The movie's pacing is snappy, and lively. But the movie is also too long (by a good 20-25 min.) for its own good, And in the end, one keeps wondering what the point of the movie is: to show how clever Chaney was (with Lynne never far away)? or what an idiot W. was? or still something else altogether? I'm not quite sure...\"Vice\" opened wide on Christmas Day, to much critical acclaim but to so-so box office success. The Friday early evening screening where I saw this at was attended okay but just okay (about 20 people). I honestly can't see this playing in theaters very long. With all of the shenanigans going on in the current White House, do people really have an appetite for a dark political portrait like \"Vice\"? I seriously doubt it. But if you have an interest in politics, or simply are a fan of Christian Bale,Amy Adams or Adam McKay, I'd readily suggest you check this out, be it at the theater, on VOD, or eventually on DVD/Blu-ray, and draw your own conclusion.",

            "review_title": "(Inevitably?) messed-up presentation and message of consequently diluted power",
            "content": "Adam McKay's \"Vice\" has been widely sold as a kind of comedy, and I guess one can imagine why, as cabaret artists were long able to get away with saying things that serious presenters might not. Yet \"Vice\" is scarcely funny at all, though it is eccentric, eclectic and indeed \"mixed up\". The means of presentation will prove an annoyance to many (with real footage, stills, mixed real and acted footage, acted scenes pretending to look real, and pure acting; as well as filmed analogies and metaphors - often involving fishing; and jumps backwards and forwards in time). However, this at odd moments denotes some quite beautiful film-making. Likewise, Nicholas Britell's score occasionally swells up and produces moments of beauty - quite uncalled for as those may be, given the context.And then there is Christian Bale's portrayal - intense and proficient as it may be - but just how damning, really? Surely no one is going to finish this movie of 130 minutes thinking Dick Cheney is a nice guy or an all-American hero, but I think it's reasonable to suggest that no monster-like figure is actually on show here.Yet nor is it a particularly nuanced or subtle portrayal - and that would be the whole thing. The film actually begins with a (crude-languaged) ha-ha-ha kind of apology to the effect that Cheney is not especially knowable, and this is certainly what we get from our movie experience. Likewise the period just before and for some years after 9/11 is now losing whatever sharpness it might have had; and things that may indeed have been monstrous seem to be fading, and now look less and less likely to raise fury or rebellion in anyone - least of all the American people.Basically, \"they\" got away with it, and that sticks - or should rightly stick - in the craw.So the film is surprisingly understated in many respects, though it adds first insights of value in suggesting that George W. Bush (here that's a quite proficient if rarely-appearing Sam Rockwell) did not hold the reins much at all, while Rumsfeld - at least in this Steve Carell portrayal - may have been the one who mentored Cheney originally, and may have been a close ally, but is ultimately in the latter's shadow, and is made to look somewhat ineffectual and clownish. This certainly looks like it might be letting Rumsfeld off the hook more than it should.And beyond that, we have the suggestion that years of bloody war and huge war spending (much of it going to private contractors, not the armed forces), as well as consequent crackdowns on rights in a number of democratic countries and not merely the US) were basically the result of machinations and fabrications (including those heard at the UN by Colin Powell - here played by Tyler Perry); while the indirect role of the US in building the appeal of ISIS is made pretty clear (in a story that parallels the earlier US role in sowing the seeds of Al Qaeda). The whole picture even encompasses the oil-motivated playing down of global warming (\"let's call it climate change\", suggests Cheney), as well as aspects like the creation of Fox News.Ironically, then, Cheney in the White House bunker on 9/11 is boiled down to pretty much just one theme (the VP consulting with his lawyer about executive power), while no reference is made to the Bush-Cheney \"voluntary\" JOINT, transcription-only, non-sworn, laughter-filled, 3-hour testifying to the 9/11 Commission (though NOT before that Commission, merely in the White House). No mention is made either of Cheney's presence alongside Rumsfeld, Perle, Wolfowitz, Zoellick, Bolton and so on in the \"Project for the New American Century\".So although the film purports to go big on the grand-scale plotting, it leaves alone things that would seem to belong. Nevertheless, a person leaving the movie will begin to digest what is involved here and realise how utterly outrageous it might be; and yet that is an aftereffect of the moviemaking, not an effect; for \"Vice\" does not go for the jugular because it could not safely do so. It sticks with the pastiche and ends up giving us a rather strange cinematic experience that somewhat parallels the one we had with Leo Di Caprio as J. Edgar Hoover. We see things of potentially seismic shock value presented, yet we cannot actually feel (or be allowed to feel) that emotion...Indeed, we can't even fully digest...Ultimately, we do not know from this movie whether Cheney lived his life in the way he may actually have done for ideology's sake, for power, for his wife, for real America, for some dream-world version of America (to make his own \"myth\"), because he was ill or messed up, because of a chip on his shoulder, because somebody had something on him, because the system went into runaway mode and could not be stopped, or indeed just because he could.The answer would be worth knowing, but may never actually be known...",

Watching the rise of the \"Crazies\" (as George H.W. Bush called them), from the Nixon era to current times, is a quite infuriating to watch unfold, despite the fine acting. Christian Bale, today's number one method actor, gets into Cheney's skin, and his performance will get under your skin. The crooked facial expressions, the cricking of his neck, his voice, his quiet form of fascism - it's all there. Amy Adams is equally on-target as Lynne. Watch this performance after seeing her in Charlie Wilson's War, where she plays a character on the opposite side of the political spectrum. And be prepared to question if it's the same person playing those roles. Steve Carrell: All I can say is, this guy floors me with nearly every movie he's made since leaving The Office. He apparently can do it all, and he gets Rumsfeld down and his performance is as eerie and accurate as Bale's. I was just disappointed we didn't get to hear Carrell spout off about Known Unknowns and Unknown Unknowns. Finally, Sam Rockwell as George W.: It's a performance similar to Josh Brolin's in \"W,\" with the cowboy boots, eating barbecue, and the down home twang. Rockwell was nominated for an Oscar for his performance, but that nomination really should have gone to Carrell.But I went to bed after watching this seriously depressed because this is our country now. No Fairness Doctrine and right wing media, which this film touches on several times, has led us here. As one character says, Nixon didn't have the luxury of Fox News and right wing radio when he was in office. Absolutely correct - had Fox and right wing radio been around in 1973, Nixon would have never resigned, and in fact would have probably been elected for another term. The end credits has a segment involving a focus group that appears periodically during the film making comments about the events happening onscreen. What happens in this end credits section is precisely where we are in 2020, on the cusp of probably the most important Presidential election in our lifetimes. It is brilliant and sums it up in only 2 minutes. McKay's next film should take THAT on.",

With Christian Bale and Amy Adams's excellent performances, it is elevated to a good movie and an 8 out of 10.\"Vice\" also benefits from some solid supporting work courtesy of Sam Rockwell and Steve Carrell.As for whether or not the movie actually provides an insight into what makes Chenney tick and thus a better idea of who he is...the question arises, do you really want all that?To me that he was shown as mostly a blank and bland slate willing to take on any features and qualities suitable for the appropriate occasion and situation, is what makes him tick and who he is. It is also what has allowed him to operate mostly under the radar and \" in the shadows\" as he'd like to say.I for one am glad not to have gotten the obligatory \"origins\" story which seems to be a cinematic prerequisite these days.Dick Chenney remains one of the most enigmatic, problematic, troubling and I'll add, scary, power brokers and wielders in Washington's recent history. I get the feeling that as time passes his story will be an unfolding one with no clear end in sight.8 out of 10",

You see in the long run there is obviously an element of Truth in this movie. There is also a huge element of Make Believe. There are so many significant parts of human life that occur were the general public has no idea of what one's true feelings were. I'm sure this is happening currently with the Biden administration. Though it is most likely true that Joe Biden is the worst president in the last hundred years, it is just as true that no one knows President Biden's true feelings about things. The media tries to fill in the blanks for us much like this movie tries to fill in the blanks for the Bush administration. If you take it seriously and lock on to the ideas projected and decide this is something you wish to believe in, who am I to tell you you can't do that? Would it be absurd to do so?

A peculiar choice to make a film about given the secrecy that surrounds him (they even make mention of it during the opening titles). Before I talk about some aspects of the film I want to say: it seriously had potential to be an Oscar contender, but won't be.The film's strongest point is the acting - it is phenomenal! The quartet of leads which are: Christian Bale, Amy Adams, Steve Carell and Sam Rockwell really shine in this movie, and it wouldn't surprise me if they feature heavily during awards season. However, Bale is in a class of his own. Hands down one of the best performances I've seen in a long time, not just by him, by anyone. He brought so much depth to the character, and it was clear he completed a conscientious study of the figure. Give him the Oscar now! Rockwell could easily go back-to-back with his exceptional portrayal of George W. Bush - Rockwell was born to play this part. Adam McKay as director and writer also deserves credit for creating, and visualising an intriguing story.Despite these positives, the editing is atrocious. Hank Corwin and his team have completely destroyed the movie. It really feels, and looks like a giant mess. Dramatised moments from Cheney's life are placed in a non-chronological order which completely confuse the audience. It doesn't feel like a proper movie.This film is a great example of a strong film ruined by editing. It really is disappointing to see, and shows everyone of the importance of this post-production element. Could've been a 10/10, editing alone dropped the score down to 6/10. I felt really frustrated after viewing this.",

            "content": "Political satires are designed to polarise, so it is not surprising that reviews of Vice (2018) range from accolades to scathing denouncements. Whether you agree with its message will depend largely on your politics and your recollection of the George W. Bush presidency. While there is wide agreement that this is a superbly acted comic bio-pic, many will recoil over the way the film's all-star ensemble lampoons the decline of a once-great democracy.The film has a mischievous blend of genre styles that uses ridicule to ask: \"how could someone become so powerful while avoiding democratic conventions and public accountability?\". That someone was Dick Cheney (Christian Bale), originally a drunkard from humble origins. But Dick had two attributes that would come to serve him well: an intelligent and ambitious wife Lynne (Amy Adams), and his own capacity for ruthlessly getting whatever he wanted. When Lynne tells him to clean up his act or lose his marriage, he takes up an internship under Donald Rumsfeld (Steve Carell) in the Nixon Administration and soon discovers a talent for manipulating powerful people while skimming favour for himself.Vice uses a bravely inelegant narrative structure based on flashbacks, mixed media, archival footage, and on-screen text. Continuity rests on a fictional omniscient narrator who has no role in the story other than to donate a major organ to the most powerful Vice-President in American history. While the story unfolds as a comic bio-pic, the humour does not always serve the narrative. For example, the opening credits use an F-bomb to assure us \"this is a true story\", setting up doubt about how seriously the film is meant to be taken. There is no shortage of light comedy, but this film is all about the questionable exercise of power at the very top. Against the satirical portrait of a shrewd manipulator who became Vice President, the film presents a child-like cartoon of the largely absent or inconsequential President George W. Bush (Sam Rockwell).Aside from the entertaining insights into the Bush era and Christian Bale's commanding performance, what is the takeaway from this film? Much is made of legal opinion known as the 'unitary theory of executive power'. It is a controversial argument that the President has unfettered power over the institutions of government and Dick Cheney was quick to extend it to his office. Protected by this view, many presidential orders were driven by Cheney, like the Iraq War, the national response to 9/11, and the use of torture in Guantanamo Bay. So the message is both clear and relevant today: when the checks and balances of democracy are ignored, the world is a far more fragile place.",

Yes Christian Bale gives an amazing performance (he should've won Best Actor) but fans of Dick Cheney will absolutely not agree with the message of this film (even if most of it is based on fact). And that is why this film, as a political statement works perfectly making use of many popular film conventions to bring across McKay's argument. He uses excellent writing along with editing to present metaphors which symbolize Dick Cheney's (Christian Bale) personality and relationships with others, especially the one he has with George W. Bush (Sam Rockwell). There is one amazing scene involving the both of them where a seasoned Cheney is manipulating the inexperienced and clumsy Bush (a scene hinted at in the trailer). The film's biggest flaw is that the time jumps often happen to quick, at one point Cheney is a young man and all of the sudden he is old and conniving. However when this film is viewed as a statement and not a biopic that flaw bugs less. In fact it is hard to judge this film. Objectively this film has many flaws (such as the time jumps or perhaps lacking more humor) but in many ways the message of the film is executed so well that I can not flaw the film too much. The actors are all fabulous especially Bale who adds humanity to Cheney but also does not make audiences root for a maniac such as Dick Cheney. Amy Adams plays his wife Lynne, the two share a Frank & Claire Underwood type relationship in which both strive for power and influence. Both of these high caliber actors carry this film with no hesitation, they share such a great chemistry and clearly enjoy playing this diabolical duo. Steve Carell and Sam Rockwell pop in and out of the film as Donald Rumsfeld and President George W. Bush in minor supporting roles. However their performances are so charismatic that they leave a serious impression on the viewer. With the right expectation, Vice works extremely well. The film may not be as funny as some had hoped (especially for fans of Adam McKay's earlier work). But fans of The Big Short should feel right at home. A film that reminds us on how the strife of power can corrupt not just a man but destroy an entire country, this might not be a film for an occasional viewing. Audiences should be prepared when viewing this film and I can not recommend this enough for younger viewers who perhaps grew up with the Iraq war but didn't quite understand how horrible the decision to invade the country really was. Of course not everything the film says can be taken as granted (similar to Oliver Stone's JFK) but it will and should encourage discussions.",

It's written & directed by Adam McKay, who had a hand in the Daddy's Home movies, Tammy, and the Anchorman movies, just to name a few. Christian plays Dick, with Amy as his wife, Lynne. It covers how Christian rose to the position of Vice President under George W, Bush's Presidency. Good old confused George is played by Sam and Steve plays Donald Rumsfeld. It also covers Christian's heart attacks-he had quite a few-and his accidental shooting of a fellow hunter, of which he never did apologize for, but the victim did apologize on camera for being shot. There are several cameos, including Tyler Perry-as Colin Powell-Naomi Watts and Alfred Molina. I must say that Christian really sunk his teeth into the role. He gained weight, shaved his head and even got the mannerisms and vocal pattern down pretty good. I can see him being nominated at Oscar time.\nIt's rated \"R\" for language and some violent images and has a running time of 2 hours & 12 minutes.\nIt's not one that I would buy on DVD-it was a little slow in parts-but if you are interested in his life, it would be alright as a rental.",

It treats the story in a very light, almost comedy way, with a totally fluid narrative. In this way, quite tragic events and cold actions perfectly enter the viewer in a much more organic way. To this is added that the story is told by the narrator, very much in the style of Martin Scorsese, this makes the story even more bearable and interesting.\nWith 'The big short' McKay had proven his ability to tell complex stories in a fun and entertaining way, this is reinforced by 'Vice', which is further proof of the great ability of this director to generate a true connection between the viewer and story.",

In 1963, Cheney works at the Wyoming electrical company after being expelled from Yale University for drinking too much and studying too little. In the fateful September 11, 2001 is the almighty vice president of the USA, reshaping the country and the globe in ways that are still felt today.A sui-generis Cheney biography from his poor and simple origins as an ordinary worker in electrical installations, his subsequent marriage to a pretentious wife and his long, almost clandestine journey, through the drains of the dark political power , culminating with his Vice-Presidency in the George W. Bush administration from 2000 to 2008 . It is presented in ironical way , that political life largely supported by his equally ambitious wife , Lynne Cheney finely acted by Amy Adams . Showing his political ambitions were generally hindered by his less than charismatic demeanor which most politicians require to succeed. Cheney was former CEO of Halliburton, still on their payroll despite \"leaving\" the company to take on the office of Vice President of the United States. Continuing an overlong politician career : Served as President Gerald Ford's White House Chief of Staff (1975-1977). Served as U. S. Representative from Wyoming (1979-1989). Served as Secretary of Defense (1989-1993) under President George Bush. Became Vice President-elect to George W. Bush on 13 December 2000, after 36 days of post-election turmoil, and a concession by opponents Al Gore and Joe Lieberman. In fact when George W. Bush was looking for a Vice Presidential running mate, he gave Cheney -who was a power in the right-wing of the Republican party- a list of names of potential nominees and asked him to pick who he thought was the best man for the job. Several days later, Cheney came back and told Bush that, after going over the list, he decided that he, himself, and not any of the men on Bush's list, should be Vice President. Bush acquiesced.Christian Bale (who shares the same birthday) brings the American politician to life in this biographical drama with hints of comedy that dissects the sewers of political power in the US , recounting how this shadowy Washington bureaucrat ended up becoming vice president with George W. Bush. The great duo of protagonists, Christian Bale and Amy Adams giving awesome acting . They're well accompanied by a competent support cast , many of them playing notorious politicians , such as : Steve Carell as Donald Rumsfeld, Sam Rockwell as George W. Bush , LisaGay Hamilton as Condoleezza Rice , Eddie Marsan as Paul Wolfowitz , Tyler Perry as Colin Powell , Bill Camp as Gerald Ford , Lily Rabe as Liz Cheney, Shea Whigham, Alison Pill , Jesse Plemons, among others.The motion picture was compellingly directed by Adam McKay . The film won an Oscar 2019 for best makeup and hairdressing and was nominated for seven more Academy awards : film, direction, screenplay, actor, editing and actor and supporting actress. In addition, Christian Bale won the Golden Globe for Best Actor for his portrayal of Dick Cheney.",

This makes the movie feel irritatingly flashy sometimes, resembling an ad more than a film. However, this does make the movie feel much fresher than most oscar contenders this year, and it might be especially attractive for fans of Lord of War or Thank you for Smoking.While some 10 minutes could have easily been left on the cutting room floor, the movie never feels overlong and manages to keep the pace brisk, helped largely by a good script and some colorful performances.Great as an introduction to Dick Cheney, and for those who complain it's to liberally biased: it might be time to read up on the chain of horrible decisions that this gang of republicans made the world suffer through.",

I do not know how much is true and what is displayed in a dishonest way. Vice asks the question is the president really in charge? Or just a salesman for an agenda? There could be a movie made about Democrat presidents about this topic but Hollywood leans left. The strongest part of Vice is Bale actually sounded, mannerism, body language was just like Dick. Other strong points are the foul mouth Rumsfield, from the military, I could see that back in the day. Sound like real life stuff. Or Dick like to drink, get into bar fights and his wife gave the Vice much needed direction. Sounds like real life. Put it together or I am leaving that story actually happens often. The deep state running the president and hidden agendas, and power plays at the Whitehouse. I am positive Machiavelli is practiced at the Whitehouse. Many people wondered about the Iraq war, and zero down mortgages etc and many left the Republican party after the disasters and a fragmented party led to the creation of Trump. If you do not like this film I am sure one will be made about the other party too. The last three out of four presidents read everything form a teleprompter make one wonder who really runs the show. Lobbyist, personal power, and hidden agendas vs serving the publics interest will be a hot topic this story line hit and is relevant with 2022 politics. 7 stars.",

Bush is pictured as being a weak, drunken, slob with little \"smarts,\" and under the influence of Cheney, ignoring his leadership abilities. it also shows other republican leaders as being power-hungry jerks who often tell perverse jokes. The narrator claims the movie to be based on good research but obviously threw in a lot of made-up \"facts.\" At the end it even tries to tie republican leaders to global problems, like boat people, fires, and other natural disasters. It is all that the literal left wished was true about Cheney and the republicans, but isn't. At the same time, the movie is very entertaining and does have surprises in the way it covers situations, and does show Cheney as a good family man, a loving protector of his wife and two girls. However, the narrator claims to be a relative of the Cheneys, to be revealed later in the movie, but he never does tell us how he is related to them.",

Unfortunately it's not nearly as interesting. Much of the problem is he's not explaining anything tricky, so the tricky illustrations just feel gimmicky. Often they feel like a real stretch.I tend to agree with people who found the basic concept of Cheney flawed. The movie sees him as primarily focused on power; a cynical guy who just wants to be in charge. But Cheney was far more of an ideologue than that. He didn't just cause a damaging war that created ISIS because he enjoyed manipulating the levers of power, but because his world view was, frankly, evil.Christian Bale does an excellent job as Dick Cheney, and Amy Adams is even better as his wife. Steve Carell is entertaining as Donald Rumsfeld, but once again feels off the mark. Rumsfeld is, like Cheney, portrayed as a political operator whose only real interest is power. But two of the defining aspects of Rumsfeld were his blinding self-assurance - the man has never acknowledged making a single error - and his shocking incompetence. The real Rumsfeld, judging by what he said and did, was an arrogant fool, the classic example of that famous phrase, \"the confidence of a mediocre white man.\"For me, Vice is too gimmicky and precious to be successful as a film and too gentle on Cheney to be an effective portrayal of someone who, regardless of how nice he was about his daughter coming out, is basically a psychopath.It's interesting sometimes, and generally watchable, but I wouldn't recommend bothering.",

This lightly comic dramatisation of Cheney's life unfortunately fails to shed much light. While it insinuates Cheney's guilt in a whole string of misdeeds, it's limited in the evidence it produces: his ties to Haliburton, for example, are very poorly detailed. Not do we get any real insight into the man and his motivations at a personal level. I'm not asking for Cheney to be elevated to sainthood; one can contrast with the fictional 'Succession', for example, which shows us awful yet wholly three dimensional people.

            "content": "Bringing on silver screen the life story of the most powerful Vice President in United States history, Vice is a messy, fragmented & unnecessarily convoluted biopic that never gets its narrative structure right, suffers from a myriad of issues, and is redeemed to only an extent, thanks to Christian Bale's transformative performance.Vice tells the story of Dick Cheney, a bureaucratic Washington insider who silently makes his way through America's political hierarchy and ends up wielding more power than anyone in his position ever did during his tenure as Vice President to George W. Bush. The plot covers the life & career of the notorious figure responsible for many currently active global conflicts.Written & directed by Adam McKay (best known for The Big Short), the film aims for a stylish depiction of events yet executes it in such an incoherent fashion that the story becomes inconvenient after a while. The non-chronological arrangement has no valid reason to exist, the back-n-forth storytelling only gets more frustrating with time, and McKay's direction is terribly unfocused.While the film offers a critical stance on Dick Cheney, the darts it keeps throwing rarely hit the target and when they do, they lack the required firepower. Editing is an absolute mess, never really managing to smoothen the bumpy ride at any given point as the story simply hops from one event to another without any sense of direction. Some key events one expects the film to explore in detail are only glanced at while many trivial stuff are retained in the final print.The only saving grace is the cast and the performances they put in but their input isn't enough to make up for all the obvious shortcomings. Christian Bale is unrecognisable as Dick Cheney, adding yet another body transformation act to his r\u00e9sum\u00e9, and it's difficult to look away when he's on screen. Amy Adams also exhibits a strong presence in the role of Lynne Cheney while both Sam Rockwell & Steve Carell provide good support in their respective roles of George W. Bush & Donald Rumsfeld.On an overall scale, Vice is erratic, muddled & utterly disjointed, and is marred by several vices of its own makings. Desperately looking for laughs amidst the horror yet failing to slot them in the right place at the right time whenever an opportunity calls for it, Adam McKay's latest is an end product of awful writing & poor direction that attempts to run before learning to walk, and other than Christian Bale's physical commitment to his role - something the actor has done throughout his career - everything about Vice is forgettable.",

''Vice'' begins with the role of Cheney in the Nixon's presidency years, and his upgrade to White House chief of staff (1975-1977) after the Watergate scandal. The director, Adam McKay, focuses on Cheney's close relationship with Donald Rumsfeld who was a friend of his and kind of a political mentor, and the significant relationship between Cheney and his wife, Lynne (Amy Adams). Later, Cheney would become The second half of the movie focuses on the years of Cheney's vice-presidency, during G.W. Bush's administration (2001-2009) and especially on crucial events of the contemporary American history, such as the 9/11 terrorist attacks and the subsequent anti-terrorist hysteria as well as the invasion of Iraq, in 2003.\nThe movie is fast-edited and attempts to cover long time-spans (nearly four decades) in just a few screen shots, and even though that works well for the most part, it sometimes gives the viewer a rushed feeling that make him feel uncomfortable and prevents him from fully concentrating on the film's narrative flow. Cheney is outlined as a tough and cynic politician, with anti-democratic tendencies, who saw opportunities for the advancement of his political career even in the worst disasters. Nevertheless, ''Vice'' shows his vulnerable side as well, that revolves around his wife and daughters.\nChristian Bale does, once again, an amazing job as he totally transforms into Dick Cheney with the help of an Oscar-winning makeup and hairstyling team. Bale ''gained 45 pounds, shaved his head, bleached his eyebrows and exercised to thicken his neck for his role as Cheney'' (IMDB Trivia) and proved that he is one of the best method actors of his generation. He even studied heart-attack prevention as Cheney has a history of heart-related diseases. Sam Rockwell in the role of G.W. Bush is great too in portraying the indecisive and easily manipulated George W. Bush.\nIf you are interested in biographies or in modern American political history, this is definitely a must-see film. But apart from that, ''Vice'' is worth watching purely because of the incredible performance by C. Bale.",

His moral ambiguity and position at Halliburton make him the ideal running mate for George W. Bush (Sam Rockwell). However, Cheney wasn't there to play second fiddle, and after 9/11 he became the puppet-master.Although brimming with outstanding performances, this dramedy about the former Veep is terribly one-sided. Narrated by a fictitious soldier and framed as part documentary, director Adam McKay attempts to edify viewers with misplaced humour and cartoonish depictions of non-democrats.Incidentally, at the end of his term, Cheney was converted into a Florida voting machine.

Adam McKay's direction on handling this biographical film about Dick Cheney does feel quite uneven. Yes, he is trying to adapt the story onto the big screen while keeping fresh and have some comical moments of trying to light up the mood. Which it works, I did enjoy some parts of the film. It does leave the movie feeling a little odd in the end. The film is narrated by Kurt (Jesse Plemons) who is a normal American civilian which has an impact and connection when it comes to the climax of the film. The movie does break the fourth wall barrier to explain to the audience about the whole situation with Dick Cheney. If it is good or bad information being given, all comes down to how the individual audience would take it.Christian Bale did great as Dick Cheney. His physical performance of gaining weight for the role and changing his hair appearance. His acting was great. Amy Adams was also good playing Lynne Cheney. Steve Carrell was also good as Donald Rumsfield. Sam Rockwell playing George W. Bush was also good.Adam McKay does a great job in handling a film with a serious topic that can easily create a controversy. He tries to make it understandable for audience who are into politics or not. I still enjoyed his other drama film The Big Short more.Overall, Vice is a fair film. The performances are great. Adam McKay's direction did seem a little off balance with trying to be funny in a serious topic.",

            "content": "After spending most of his career larking around with Will Ferrell in the likes of Talladega Nights: The Ballad of Ricky Bobby, Step Brothers and The Other Guys, writer/director Adam McKay took a huge leap towards 'serious' film-making in 2015 when he released The Big Short, a funny, intelligent and unexpectedly engrossing account of the 2007-2008 financial crisis. The Big Short may not sound like much fun on paper, but McKay latched onto this idea, making the tedious subject of subprime loans and triple-A ratings interesting by entwining it with pop culture, employing the likes of Margot Robbie and Selena Gomez to dumb it down for the audience in a manner that was too wickedly clever to ever be patronising. With Academy recognition now under his belt, McKay strides into his next project - a biopic of one of the most fearsome yet enigmatic political figures in U.S. history - with confidence, and dare I say it, a touch of arrogance.McKay is eager to perform the same trick again with Vice, a sporadically inspired but frustratingly blunt quasi-biography that feels to penetrate the skin of its subject or answer the big question of just what was the driving force behind the man who turned the symbolic position of Vice President into one of great power and influence. Rather than dig deeper, McKay prefers to allow Dick Cheney's actions to speak for themselves, occasionally cutting away to a visual metaphor, such as, in the case of Cheney's key meeting with Sam Rockwell's George W. Bush, a cheetah bringing down its prey. Cheney is a man McKay clearly views as a highly functioning psychopath, tracking his journey from working under Steve Carell's Donald Rumsfeld in the Nixon Administration, to his opportunistic lunge for control in the immediate aftermath of the 9/11 attacks. He fought to grant more power to a President he easily manipulated, praying on his short attention span and lack of political know-how, and to legalise torture, finding a massive legal loophole in the shape of Guantanamo Bay.Vice is structured like a classic coming-of-age movie, with its 'hero' rising and falling, before dusting himself off and getting to his feet to rise again. After President Ford (Bill Camp) is voted out of office, seemingly closing all political doors for Cheney, McKay rolls the credits and pans away from the Cheney household, before an abrupt phone call reminds us that this story has barely begun. Like many of the jokes in Vice, the credit-roll-fake-out is funnier in theory than execution, and the film often takes the trickery so far that it threatens to undermine the seriousness of the subject matter. Satire must be funny, but it must also carry an emotional wallop that McKay struggles to find. At the centre of it all is Christian Bale's powerhouse performance, which explores a man whose obsessiveness could be compared to that of the actor's own extreme approach to his craft. Once again Bale takes his own body to the limit, piling on the pounds to resemble a man who suffered multiple heart attacks throughout his life (it becomes a running gag in the film), and adopting a deep growl capable of subtle intimidation. The performances of Bale, Carrel and Rockwell are all worth the entry fee alone, but Vice stutters to engage on a deeper level, failing to explain just how an oil company CEO can seize control of one of the most powerful countries in the world, and execute his plans with such cold indifference.",

            "content": "Adam McKay has such a unique brand of humour. I remember when I saw 'The Big Short' a few years back thinking how I had never seen a film like it before. 'Vice' is a quite a similar film in a lot ways. It's very self-aware and the humour is always edgy, cutting and dark. It's not a film you sit there and laugh out loud at like perhaps 'Anchorman' (also a McKay film believe it or not) but it is still unquestionably funny. For example the opening writing on the screen telling us that the film is 'Based on a true story' is possibly the funniest moment in the film and a prime example of what this film wants to be about. If you don't find that writing funny you should probably just leave the cinema at that point because you're not going to enjoy the film.Three actors from this film have been nominated for acting awards at the Academy Awards. Christina Bale for Actor in a lead role and Amy Adams and Sam Rockwell for Actress/Actor in a support role. Bale had an incredible transformation to prepare for the role and with a slightly stronger film and more scenes for him to impress us in he would have had a great chance of winning. As it stands I can't see him getting close however. It's the same story for the other two. Adams barely has anything to do in the film (Supporting Actress is a notoriously weak category) and Rockwell is actually fantastic (as always) but just isn't given enough to do.The problem with 'Vice' is that Dick Cheney just wasn't interesting enough to justify a movie about. The fact that this is as watchable as it is shows just how strong the writing and film making actually were. The second half of the film is the better of the two and it really picks up pace near the end. It even delivers a minor twist-ending of sorts. Sadly though I can't see this film being remembered. It just didn't have enough material to work with.",

            "content": "Review:\nI was really impressed with the acting in this movie, especially from Christian Bale who plays the US Vice President Dick Cheney, and I liked the way that the director shot the film, but the subject matter has been done to death. I really find US politics tedious and boring, so it didn't take long before I got bored with the plot. The chemistry between Dick Cheney and his wife, Lynne (Amy Adams) was great, and the fact the Christian Bale put on all that weight for the film, showed that he took the role seriously. Although this is a biopic about Dick Cheney, it felt like other movies about US politics, which is full of corruption and a hunger for power. Casting Sam Rockwell as George W. Bush was a touch of genius, along with Steve Carell as Donald Rumsfeld, and the wit in the script, gave it a unique edge but it was the \"All American\" subject matter that let it down. Anyway, the film is narrated by Kurt (Jesse Plemons), a fictitious veteran of the Afghanistan and Iraq wars. The film opens with Dick Cheney and other White House officials and staff responding to the September 11, 2001, attacks. The film then flashes back to Wyoming in 1963, where Cheney finds work as a lineman after his alcoholism led him to drop out of Yale University. After Cheney is stopped by a traffic cop for driving while intoxicated, his wife Lynne convinces him to clean up his life. The film flashes forward to 1969 when Cheney finds work as a White House intern during the Nixon Administration. Working under Nixon's economic adviser, Donald Rumsfeld, Cheney becomes a savvy political operative as he juggles commitments to his wife and their daughters, Liz and Mary. Cheney overhears Henry Kissinger discussing the secret bombing of Cambodia with President Richard Nixon, revealing the true power of the executive branch to Cheney. After Nixon's resignation, Cheney rises to the position of White House Chief of Staff for President Gerald Ford while Rumsfeld becomes Secretary of Defence. After Ford is voted out of office, Cheney runs to be representative for Wyoming. After giving an awkward and uncharismatic campaign speech, Cheney suffers his first heart attack. While he recovers, Lynne campaigns on her husband's behalf, helping him to win a seat in the U.S. House of Representatives. During the Reagan Administration, Cheney supported a raft of conservative, pro-business policies favouring the fossil fuel industries. He also supported the abolishment of the FCC fairness doctrine which led to the rise of Fox News, Conservative talk radio, and the rising level of party polarization in the United States. Cheney next serves as Secretary of Defence under President George H. W. Bush during the Gulf War. Outside of politics, Cheney and Lynne come to terms with their younger daughter, Mary, coming out as lesbian. Though Cheney develops ambitions to run for president, he decides to retire from public life to spare Mary from media scrutiny. During the presidency of Bill Clinton, Cheney becomes the CEO of Halliburton while his wife raises golden retrievers and writes books. Cheney is invited to become running mate to George W. Bush during the 2000 United States presidential election. Recognising that the younger Bush is more interested in pleasing his father that attaining power for himself, Cheney agrees on the condition that Bush delegates \"mundane\" executive responsibilities, such as energy, the military, and foreign policy, to him. As Vice President, Cheney works with Secretary of Defence Rumsfeld, legal counsel David Addington, Mary Matalin, and the Chief of Staff, Scooter Libby, to exercise control of key foreign policy and defence decisions throughout Washington. The film returns to the aftermath of the September 11 attacks, as Cheney and Rumsfeld manoeuvre to initiate and then preside over the U.S. invasions of Afghanistan and Iraq, resulting in the killing of hundreds of thousands of civilians and the torture of prisoners. As the War on Terror mounts, Cheney continues to struggle with persistent heart attacks. The film also covers various events from his vice presidency, including his endorsement of the unitary executive theory, the Plame affair, the accidental shooting of Harry Whittington, and tensions between the Cheney sisters over same-sex marriage. Cheney's actions are shown to lead to hundreds of thousands of deaths and the rise of the Islamic State of Iraq, resulting in him receiving record-low approval ratings by the end of the Bush administration. While narrating Cheney's tearful deathbed goodbye to his family after another hospitalisation, Kurt is killed in a motor accident while jogging, In March 2012, and his healthy heart is transplanted into Cheney. A few months later, Cheney acquiesces to his daughter Liz's saying she is opposed to same-sex marriage when she runs for a Senate seat in Wyoming, leaving Mary angry and upset. Liz later wins the election to her father's former Congressional position. At the end of the film, an irate Cheney breaks the fourth wall and delivers a monologue to the audience, stating that he has no regrets about anything he has done in his career. It's hard to explain this film in a few words, which is why this review is so long. I must admit, I did get a bit fed up with the whole \"back and forth\" in time theme because it spoilt the flow of the film. I also would have liked to have seen more scenes with Sam Rockwell, who deserved his nomination for an Oscar. Anyway, it's definitely worth a watch for the terrific performances but the political content makes it an average film, in my opinion! Watchable!Round-Up:\nThis movie was directed by Adam McKay, who also brought you Anchorman 1 & 2, Talladega Nights, Step Brothers, Green Team, The Other Guys and the Big Short. Judging by his previous projects, I'm surprised that he decided to make a biopic about such an influential US politician, who worked behind the scenes. Most of the cast in this film, was in the Big Short, which also didn't make that much money at the box office, but it was highly praised. Personally, I think that it's the subject matters that he chooses, which are not going down to well with the audiences. They're not the type of movies that you can watch time and time again, but the actors always seem to give there all. I just hope that his next movie is about something that we all can relate to!Budget: $60million\nWorldwide Gross: $76millionGenre: Biography, Comedy, Drama\nCast: Christian Bale, Amy Adams, Steve Carell, Sam Rockwell, Alison Pill, Tyler Perry, Eddie Marsan, Justin Kirk, LisaGay Hamilton, Jesse Plemons, Bill Camp, Don McManus, Lily Rabe and Shea Whigham. 6/10",

Bush. Director McKay (who's clearly trying to inject some irony into the proceedings with his off-the-wall storytelling methods) benefits from strong casting in key roles, and interested viewers are likely to be drawn to the more clandestine workings of the controversial Bush Administration, but the continual use of narration, flashbacks, and false climaxes does more of a disservice to the film, and despite all the behind-the-scenes manipulation and in-fighting it's never as engrossing as it should be. Bale gives yet another splendid, transformative performance as the irascible Cheney, with help from Adams as his driven, no-nonsense wife Lynne, Carell as a colorful Rumsfeld, and Rockwell who makes a vibrant Bush.

            "content": "Dick Cheney's apprenticeship during Nixon, Ford and Reagan, private sector exodus during Carter and Clinton and ascent to nearly unlimited power as Bush Jr's running mate / handler. It's hopeless to argue that this film doesn't have an agenda - the trailers alone should have made that abundantly clear - and it makes no effort to hide or balance that essential bias. Cheney is played as a man who values nothing beyond personal gain, even going so far as to ask \"what should I believe in\" during an informal chat early in his career. He's less transparent later on, as his understanding of political gamesmanship improves, and by the time he's asked to join the GOP ticket in 2000, he can ask for the moon.Basically, we're watching the birth of a hardened super-villain without the inconvenience of actually breaking any laws. Or, I suppose, of being caught for doing so. That's serious subject matter, but the tone varies unexpectedly from grim and straight to playful and silly. Often several times in one scene, which makes for a somewhat confusing viewing experience. It can't decide between hammering an important point and nailing a ripe punchline, valiantly tries to accomplish both and rarely succeeds at either. A gimmicky narrative style and ambitious use of jump cuts further muddy those waters.The acting follows suit. Some scenes are rich and effective, Christian Bale becoming the lead role in more than just a physical sense, while others just... don't work? Steve Carrell's casting as Donald Rumsfeld is a good example; a take that could have really come together, but plays instead like a weird mix of his better-known parts in The Office and Anchorman. It's an entertaining film and an important story, with a few hooks that almost sink in, but struggles with tonal inconsistency and an inner conflict that's never completely resolved.",

Ultimately, he failed at everything. It is hard to accurately portray the life of someone of Chenney's magnitude in a span of 2 hours. Instead of focusing on certain events by making them look dramatic and impactful, McCay ends up skimming though 40 years with jokes and flashes. Flow is absolutely non existent with some of the worst editing that I have ever seen. What's even worse, is that by trying to use the narrator and explanation cuts like in The Big Short, he just sinks it even deeper.Big props to the makeup department and the lead actors, specially Bale and Carell. Also a nod to the midway ending which was creative. McCay tried to make a crossover between House of Cards and Big Short but did not know where to lean. The entire film, he treats the audience as if we are idiots by explaining the obvious and not giving us anything new except the countless names of politicians, departments and laws that no one cares about.I have no idea how it got these nominations but if you decide to go and see it, watch Fahrenheit 9/11 first, it will make this movie easier to digest.",

Secondly when you have a crisis, the void of decision making will be filled by someone capable of making decisions.The movie was tedious, tiresome and just nothing happened. Mr Cheney was dry, humourless and ruthless, both unexceptional reasons to make a movie, and this movie dies on its feet.

            "content": "Christian Bale plays former Vice President Dick Cheney in this grandly ambitious biopic, a role in which he mostly excels. Amy Adams has rarely been better as his devoted wife, Lynne Cheney, who as it turns out is just as power hungry as he is. Sam Rockwell gives an uncanny performance as President George W. Bush. Finally, Steve Carell is a solid presence as Donald Rumsfeld.Given all these credible performances, this should have been a knockout. Such a shame the screenplay and the editing are so choppy and the pacing is so frenetic it sometimes becomes monotonous. The game cast does a dignified job with the often painfully cartoonish dreck that is the screenplay. That this film can veer between stately drama and high camp is a testament to the filmmaker's ability, albeit sprayed in every direction. It is all capped off with the most bizarrely ludicrous closing credits I have seen in a film this decade, bar none. This film puts on a clinic on how to waste solid acting.Adam McKay is at his best when his directorial craft is completely invisible- when his storytelling is so potent and eloquent that you get lost in his witty, propulsive style and for the moment forget the complexity of the issues he's hammering away at. Here, his work feels too heavy-handed and sloppy for it to work as well. There is a kernel of character development in how Cheney might have become a different man over time but it is completely buried in the narrative chaos that the film is inexorably committed to.This looked good on paper. There is considerable talent at work here. In the end, against considerable odds, it goes down as a misfire for its woeful writing, exhausting narrative and a tin ear for how to conclude. For those who are easily amused or who need a quick primer on recent U.S. history, this film might be worthwhile. Otherwise, I decline to recommend it.",

Sure, I can see how his comedy background could lead to the razor-sharp wit used to educate the movie-going public about the 2008 mortgage crisis and the former vice president, respectively. It's evident the Academy likes his new style as well, as both The Big Short and Vice were nominated for Best Picture. While I liked The Big Short a lot, Vice certainly had its moments.I'll give props to Christian Bale for his ability to mimic Dick Cheney's mannerisms in this role. Sam Rockwell was also pretty great as George W. Bush, but I couldn't get past Steve Carell as Donald Rumsfeld. I also appreciated the tongue-in-cheek \"false ending\" in Vice, as it was probably one of the funniest moments in the film. Just like how learning about the mortgage crisis was terrifying, it was equally terrifying learning how these career politicians were able to do whatever they want. Unfortunately, since this movie was played almost more like a straight biopic, it lost the ability for many of its humorous, educational asides and cameos that made The Big Short so enjoyable.Overall, I liked this movie's style, and I'm sure McKay has found a niche where he can be successful. After all, how much does the public know about some of these topics? Do we know how much our lives are affected by others focused on greed? These pseudo-documentaries are a great way to entertain and inform us, even if the political bias can occasionally peek it's head out from behind the veneer of comedy.Another entertaining expos\u00e9 from director Adam McKay, I give Vice 4.0 stars out of 5.",

I thought it was creative, informative and clever. I was never aware of much of Dick Cheney's story but Vice did a great job of providing facts and entertainment. I don't think this film has as much of a liberal bias as the dreadful mid-credits scene says it does (seriously, that mid-credit scene almost ruined the movie for me. It was that bad.) It definitely gets more biased as the film progresses but I think most of the film can be enjoyed by all points on the political spectrum. The biggest problems had to be the lack of a clear narrative. There is only so much that can be put into a 2 hour movie and when you have over 50 years worth of material to choose from, some stuff gets cut. It could have been done better but it wasn't done poorly. The inclusion of a narrator was a solid choice but the way it was done can be questioned. Christian Bale did a fantastic job. The complete lack of emotion shown by Cheney throughout the movie is what sticks with me most. I've seen plenty of actors try to play placid characters before and I can't think of any that have done a better job than Bale. It's not really a lack of emotion that he's portraying it's more of a dominating sense of indifference for everything that stands in the way of his goals. In addition to the top notch acting of not only Bale but the whole cast, McKay did well with such a sensitive topic. The 4th wall breaking was done in a manner that came off as clever rather than cringey which is something that few movies can do, the dialogue is mostly believable and the film respects the audience's intelligence. What I admired a lot about Vice is that it actually had something to say. Regardless of where you fall on the issues, I think the effort should be respected.",

I haven't seen his last movie The Big Short yet which was his first time working with Christian Bale and Steve Carell.Vice is a Dick Cheney biopic, he was George W. Bush's Vice President. I'm not a political guy, I watched Vice because I like the cast and I heard it's stylish. Vice was okay, it's ambitious but messy. I think everyone praised the acting, the cast was good mainly Christian Bale and Amy Adams. I don't think Bale disappeared into his role but Adams did because she wore wigs and she spoke in a different accent.The editing and story structure is messy, it shifts between time periods many times. It quickly begins in 1963, shifts to 9/11 and it shifts back to the past for awhile. It cuts to photos, objects and war footage but it's not always incoherent. Vice is two hours and twenty minutes long, you certainly feel the length. I feel it's ten, fifteen minutes overlong, Cheney's past should of been cut down and the tax stuff which was boring should of been cut down.McKay is a Democrat so he doesn't like Bush or Cheney. I guess he doesn't mind George H.W. Bush who recently died. Yes they're portrayed as villains mainly Cheney. He authorized or encouraged policies that are still used like torturing prisoners. He's humanised in his personal life, he's a loving husband and father. I think Cheney is a loving family man in real life but McKay could of portrayed him as a lousy family man which he probably considered.Vice was alright, I don't know if I'll see it again.

It is, after all, about Dick Cheney, a man who isn't portraited in a clear-cut fashion, but rather in several different shades of gray. Power-hungry, greedy and unscrupulous, but also very family-centered. Competent and incompetent, dumb and incredibly cunning, a mere lackey at first and one of the most powerful man in the world later on. Mostly amoral. The film doesn't exactly give Dick Cheney sympathy, but doesn't indulge in beating him to a pulp without trying to paint his character with at least a fair share of ambiguity.Some might argue against this film for being too satirical and breaking the fourth wall too often. Yet this was an absolutely necessary technique for us to be able to enjoy this movie. This story is just too dark to be able to do without some humour thrown in the mix.Praise should be given to Christian Bale, not only for his outstanding performance, but to be willing to gain so much weight just for a movie role, when other techniques could be employed.

What's absolutely beyond debate is that this film tells that story creatively and ingeniously. I wondered whether the little tricks of \"The Big Short\" would get old, but they just plain work here. Between those brilliant little satirical explanations and self aware jokes and some amazing performances (especially by Carrell and Bale), this movie is just...good.

The film is directed and partly produced by Adam McKay, the director of The Big Short and The Other Guys.\nThe film is about the biography of Dick Cheney an American politician from the Republican Party. He was the 46th Vice President of the United States from 2001 to 2009 under President George W. Bush. Dick Cheney is played in the film by Christian Bale.\nDick Cheney was a modest bureaucratic insider from Washington, who quietly used an immense power as the vice president of George W. Bush (Sam Rockwell). Thus he re-shaped America and the rest of the world in ways we still see today.\nThis film is not told in a chronological way and is filled with time jumps from the present to the past and the future. The cast provides further comments with voice overs or in separate scenes.\nAdam McKay also told the story in the movie The Big Short in such a way. Only this way of telling does not work as well as it did at The Big Short. At The Big Short he told the story about how smart investors benefited from their investment plans while the economy went the wrong way. With Vice he tries to show how with too much power and influence a politician can make corrupt decisions, without others being able to talk to him or stop his plans.Despite the fact that it is an interesting story, too many different things happen, which makes the story of the film somewhat messy. If Adam McKay had told the story in a chronological way and omitted the unnecessary extra scenes, the story would be a lot clearer.\nWhat does help with the realistic transfer of the film are the film sets and costumes of the cast. These are always adapted to the different times in which the story takes place.\nWhat the film really bears is the acting of the cast and then all the acting of Christian Bale. He comes across as realistic as Dick Cheney in the way he talks and the facial postures he has in conversations with different people. Christian Bale has also really arrived for this role. He has been nominated for this film for the Oscar for best Male lead. Other cast members such as: Amy Adams, Steve Carell and Sam Rockwell also perform well in the film.

There will be almost no middle ground, and the reason for that is extremely vivid. The movie does nothing to appeal to all persons, it simply plays out the way it wants to, weather one likes it or not.The story. A biography of Cheney's life and political career could be told in numerous ways. The sole focus on the 9/11 attack and the decisions made based on that attack could have been a center, but this movie decided to go a bit sideways. The audience is presented with Cheney from the very start of his political career to his very end. Since we are talking about a man whose political career spanned for more than 4 decades (give or take) a smart way to depict that was needed. McKay decided to go with a multitude of short scenes depicting the most influential and important segments of Cheney's life and political career. The overall result is a never dull and constantly moving piece of work that doesn't allow one to take his/her eyes of the screen (for you will surely miss an important segment). The focus does switch somewhere at the middle of the movie, when the Bush Jr. administration segment comes in. At that point the movie drastically slows down and depicts in more detail certain important aspects of the new millennia history. Of course that is the point when Bale's \"Satanic\" depiction of Cheney comes full frontal. The switch in the character and the story is almost shocking and the way McKay directed it and Bale played it, only emphasizes that shock. The most interesting segment of the story are also the metaphors and comparisons to the wildlife. The one segment at the very end of the movie depicting the beating heart in the background of Cheney's most controversial life decision really sticks with the viewer. However, certain segments could have been explored more, some elements could have been omitted, but it would, in that case, been a very different movie. I am still not sure if I have viewed a political satire or comedy or a drama with just a good sense of humor. But, whatever it was, I liked it.The acting. Most biographical movies do not linger much on the story because their real power lies in the depiction of characters. When you have Bale as your lead and Adams to support, you are surely on a winning streak. But, I do not believe anyone expected their performance to be this good. Bale is on the road to win his second Academy Award (however, due to the sincerely strange choices in the last few years, there is a chance he loses - and that will be one of the Academy's greatest mistakes). His method acting brought him so far into the mind and soul of Cheney that at a certain point one looses the idea that they are watching a movie instead of a documentary. The way he portrayed Cheney's decent into absolute darkness and malevolence throughout the movie is astounding (helped profoundly by the cinematography and lighting). However, his most powerful moments are the ones when he is making decisions and giving orders. His presence is violently disturbing and profoundly scary, especially in the \"Leek it.\" and other similar scenes. Adams on the other hand was just superb. Interestingly enough, the Adams Bale tandem works splendidly (as portrayed in American Hustle and the Fighter). However, even though Bale is the lead and the movie does deal with him mostly, her presence is noticeable at every turn. Every scene she is in, she constantly fights with Bale to take dominion over the scene (which could have been a disaster but worked out perfectly - just as the Lynne and Dick in real life). The viewer simply cannot help himself and not hate her. She is mean and vicious in all the wrong ways, unlike Cheney/Bale who is mean and vicious because of political reasons. Her performance should most definitely win her an Academy Award because she truly stood al pari with Bale in every scene (and that is no simple task). Rockwell was a laugh. He portrayed Bush almost exactly as the real one acted - lost and frightened, surrounded with the most powerful and vicious people in the world, making all the wrong decisions in the wrong time. A truly stellar performance. Finally, Rummy. The one that I thought was the greatest miscast in movie history tuned out to be one of the movies best performance. Steve Carell did Rumsfeld such an honor with this portrayal that it is a shame he didn't have more screen time. The candor, the energy, the rudeness and warmongering is portrayed with such ease that it was a joy to watch. The make up department also did a splendid job making him look almost exactly like the real Rumsfled. All the way up to the final scene and his eventual demise, Carell played Rumsfeld with spectacular ease and joy, which made him a joy to watch.The editing. Probably the most divisive aspect of the movie. In order to create such a fast paced and entertaining movie, short fast paced scenes are needed. It will not be everyone's cup of tea but, for a movie like this to work, you really need crazy and unorthodox editing.The music. Perfectly fitting. Simple but powerful, emotional but strong. The theme of the movie that plays during the finale and the infamous \"Nod\" scene stays with the viewer long after the credits roll.All in all, Vice will not be the most beloved movie of all times, but it will definitely be remembered as the best Bush administration biopic to date. If you are looking for a hard drama, avoid it. If you are looking for comedy, avoid it. It you are looking for a classic biopic, avoid it. But, if you are looking for a perfect blend of all three, this is the movie for you. Taking into consideration the other nominees, I do feel that Vice should win most of the important awards this year because it really is the only classic Oscar worthy movie we have seen in a long time. Near perfect.",

            "content": "Political thrillers are risky endeavours, as you're generally at the peril of alienating at least half the audience before you even begin writing the script. In Adam McKay's Dick Cheney biopic 'Vice,' we get a quasi-comedic travel back through the early 2000s (and earlier) to meet the man that so many have made out to be the equivalent of an American Darth Vader (or maybe Emperor Palpatine?).In typical McKay fashion, 'Vice' is filmed in a style that feels unserious and slick. Maybe it's in the cinematography, more likely it has to do with the editing. Either way, this is not an episode of 'The West Wing.' It does, however, feel like an episode of 'House of Cards' on LSD (I'm sorry, I have a hard time believing Lynne Cheney was the original Claire Underwood).Clearly, 'Vice' is not a documentary - and the filmmakers make this clear at the very start, attributing some gaps being filled due to the \"mystery\" of the former vice president. Still, there are a good deal of bright spots here, primarily in the acting. Christian Bale's Cheney is spot-on, and Amy Adams deserves praise for her performance as Lynne. But it's probably Steve Carell's \"Rummy\" who steals the show.It's highly likely you'll have strong feelings about 'Vice' depending on which side of the aisle your politics falls on. Strip away the bells and whistles and the film is really average at best, primarily because it never really figures out what it's trying to be.",

            "content": "\"You are the President. War is yours.\" - Vice President Richard \"Dick\" Cheney (Christian Bale) to President George W. Bush (Sam Rockwell)Potential spoilers belowThree years after The Big Short propelled writer-director Adam McKay from comedy auteur of the 2000s to Academy Award-winning fervent societal satirist, he and Christian Bale (Best Supporting Actor Oscar nominee for The Big Short) team up once again with Vice. Less than the sum of its parts, Vice showcases yet another transformative performance by Bale, fast burning turns by co-stars Amy Adams and Sam Rockwell, and excessive narration by Jesse Plemons. All these serve an imposing expos\u00e9 trajectory that pales next to The Big Short's brilliance and, despite the conviction of Nicholas Britell's patriotic yet macabre-sounding score, ineffectively insists on Cheney's political career as the great American horror story of the past half-century.In 132 minutes spanning just over a half-century, writer-director McKay tracks the life of Richard \"Dick\" Cheney (Christian Bale, pudgy and partially-bald) from his early days as an alcoholic \"ne'er-do-well\" with frustrated girlfriend and eventual wife Lynne (Amy Adams) by his side. Working his way to Washington, D.C., Cheney apprentices under future Secretary of Defense Donald \"Rummy\" Rumsfeld (Steve Carell, delightfully nasty) finding his life calling as a \"humble servant to power\". Finally, Dick Cheney rises to become, with George W. Bush (Sam Rockwell, relishing playing dim-witted) as President, one of the most powerful and secretive Vice Presidents in United States and arguably world history.I feel safe in saying that Vice is no Big Short. The Big Short woke audiences up; Vice pressures audiences to get terrified and incensed. The Big Short transitioned from comedy to tragedy like a rug swiftly pulled from underneath everyone's feet. Vice, somehow angrier than BlacKkKlansman by Spike Lee, locks into horror mode for its subject matter to the extent that only those politically inclined will fully view the horror presented as such.That said, McKay, Bale, and company certainly try their hardest. From time to time throughout Vice, McKay has film editor and Big Short alum Hank Corwin insert, among many other things, fish and fishing imagery. Whereas Christ once told Peter and Andrew that he will make them \"fishers of men\" (Matthew 4:19; Mark 1:17) and convert souls to God and truth, Vice's fish and fishing imagery suggest an entirely separate and sinister agenda of baiting. For big fish like VP Cheney, Sec. Def. Rumsfeld, their minions, and their puppets (including arguably Pres. George W. Bush), their bait was power - wartime power in particular. For the guppies of the American public, their bait was the promise of a robust and absolute executive branch in the United States government. Vice communicates these dynamics well enough and with endless kick throughout, though the latter dynamic truly hits home with Cheney's blistering final monologue to the camera.McKay's vision does not work without Christian Bale's chameleon-like performance as VP Cheney. One all but accepts that Bale is Cheney - hairline, heart issues, dulled vocal inflections, and all - that Vice's final cut does not even need the brief shot of a shirtless and beer-bellied Cheney seen in the middle of the electrifying trailer. Vice is Bale's show to the point that recognizing anyone else for acting awards feels excessive. Such marks the supporting performances of Amy Adams as wife Lynne Cheney and Sam Rockwell as Pres. George W. Bush. (Rockwell recently won the Best Supporting Actor Oscar for his performance in Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri.) As with Claire Foy in First Man and Laura Harrier in the aforementioned BlacKkKlansman, Adams' moments of channeling Lady Macbeth are few and far between. After the sudden and magical soliloquy between her and Bale as he decides whether or not to accept the VP role from Rockwell, Adams falls to the background for the rest of Vice's runtime. As for Rockwell, it surprises me to say that he factors little into the story outside of when he offers the VP job to Bale. Also, it is hard to resist viewing his performance as little more than an impression, what with all the past sketches and caricatures imaginable, not to mention Josh Brolin's more comprehensive take in W., the 2008 Oliver Stone film.In the end, Vice would have benefited from greater balance and, dare I say, minimized bias. Any depicted conservative figures need not fall into either spineless expendables or conniving power-seekers, especially when any shortcomings of liberal figures get the briefest of appearances (e.g., a pro-Iraq War speech snippet by then-Sen. Hillary Clinton, a clip of the flub in Pres. Barack Obama's first inaugural oath) or are overlooked entirely. Why portray a young Antonin Scalia (Sam Massaro) as a snickering goblin, even though he would go on to get unanimously confirmed by the Senate to become a Supreme Court Justice? Is it not a bit narrow-minded to visually prefer Pres. Jimmy Carter to Pres. Ronald Reagan based almost entirely by the former's installation of solar panels on the White House roof and the latter's dismantling of them? What if they were not efficient enough yet? Perhaps fourth wall-breaking commentary from the rest of the cast, instead of from Jesse Plemons (whose underwhelming link with Cheney comes right near the end), would have provided some of that needed balance.What a time to live in America.(Parental Note: Vice has been rated R by the MPAA \"for language and some violent images\". It has also been rated 15 by the BBFC for \"strong language, disturbing scenes,\" and \"infrequent bloody images\", and L (Limited adult audience) by the Catholic News Service for \"scenes of combat violence, gory and gruesome images, partial nudity, a lesbian theme, several uses of profanity, about a half-dozen milder oaths, and frequent rough and crude language.\")(P.S. Keep an eye out for a mid-credits scene.)R.N.B.",

With a base script that opens up a range of topics and discussions through his editing, the film directed and scripted by Adam Mackay, director accustomed to conventional comedies departs for his second most serious film dealing with some American woe but without losing his humorous vein , and already creating his indenity, his audiovisual signature.\nhis script is sour, telling the story of the clever and manipulative American vice president of the Bush son era, wrapped in social polemics, wars, tortures, occultations. The film is accurate in character development and its script-pleasing artifacts are very different, few habitual, but at one point end up weighing in the rhythm of the long, but end up containing a good part of a long republican political history in just two hours , its weight is normal and the assembly devices serve to relieve it, although in practice this does not work as well.\nTechnically, the feature uses a lot of montage and dictation, leaving everything more frenetic and appropriating several analogies that fit very well, in addition to an excellent sense of humor but not always visible, \"Vice\" can tire many viewers, but those who have already been hooked for their bait, will remain glazed until the end, it is worth highlighting also for the editing and sound mixing that is magnificent, another point that is splendid is their makeup, Bale is unrecognizable, Amy Adams is old, everything is very faithful to the original cartoons and work very well in the film, we already have a guaranteed Oscar here.\nThe film was very acclaimed for its performances, but in fact, Chtistian Bale is great, aggravating his voice and giving a unique weight the same, every time that Dick speaks, it is not in vain, everything has a very strong weight, we owe this to the Bale's vocal work that also gives us a change of physique that goes far beyond makeup, showing a commitment to acting, and finally, his mannerisms, his posture, even the way the protagonist moves his glasses has an air maleficent of wisdom, manipulation and intelligence, is a firm and robust performance, caricature but undoubtedly reliable and accurate. In addition, Amy Adams is well, makes a fundamental character, with much depth and dramatic charge, but its indication to the oscar was exaggerated.\n\"Vice\" finally fulfills his role, is a good movie, addictive, funny, dramatic with depth, script, direction and acting, with some problems is true, abuse of editing and confusing explanation of facts, assertion of events that do not are proven and bar forcing, but we can not fail to see that it is a fiction based on real events, nothing more, but certainly is one of the highlights of 2019.",

            "content": "Dick Cheney's (Christian Bale) rise from a boozy dropout to becoming the most powerful Vice President in American history, taking in his early days under Nixon and ultimately 9/11, the invasion of Iraq and the torture and surveillance programmes of the War On Terror. Imagine beaming back to 2004 and telling your younger, thinner self that the guy who made Anchorman would go on to become one of the most interesting political filmmakers America has produced in years. His follow-up to The Big Short, Adam McKay's Vice, with its sweep and cast of powerful people, is oddly reminiscent of Oliver Stone's Nixon, except the tone is far more amused than that film's operatic pomp - but in its own way just as angry. Vice does share some of Nixon's sprawl, though: it is focused on Dick Cheney, but also serves as a genealogy of the various mutations of the American right as it descended from cynical to genuinely ghoulish. Tellingly, at no point does any political character - and there are a lot to get your head around - talk about any issue in terms of ethics, morality, or benefitting people's lives, with Steve Carell's Donald Rumsfeld openly scoffing at the idea as he inducts Cheney into '70s Washington. Cheney's USP as a politician was an extreme form of cynical realpolitik and a willingness to go to, as he openly called it, the dark side. In one late-film monologue, he makes a case for this own Magnificent Bastard status, making that traditional villain's plea that he alone had the stones to make the decisions limp liberals couldn't. The film has the smarts to let him state his position, but also wisely chooses not to exonerate or soften a man with tens of thousands of bodies on him. But this is no dry piece of political analysis. Much like The Big Short, McKay plays formal games and deploys engaging performances to help the medicine go down. One mid-film gambit regarding a potential alt-timeline for Cheney is so bonkers it brings the house down, although repeated cutaways to reeling in fish as Cheney bends George W. Bush to his will do play a bit to the back row. It's no surprise at this point to say Christian Bale delivers a good performance, but he really is sensational here. Disappearing under make-up and a gut, and with an upper body he carefully trained to tally with the VP's hunched silhouette, he transforms into Cheney before your eyes. It's often too easy to hail performances like this for the perspiration more than the inspiration, but the feat Bale manages here is far more than just another body modification stunt. Nailing Cheney's distinctive growl, he creates a man where it's seldom clear if he has the dirty work foisted upon him, or if he seeks it out in a kind of moral martyrdom. Amy Adams, meanwhile, equals Bale as Lynne Cheney, who's a surprisingly compelling figure if you only know her from that namecheck in Eminem's 'Without Me'. In a performance very reminiscent of her turn in The Master, she easily hurdles any Republican Wife clich\u00e9s and, as her husband's career comes home in ways you might not expect, she increasingly becomes the film's conscience - or lack thereof. Despite Bale's incredible work as Cheney this isn't really a character study. Just as The Big Short was a lesson in finance disguised as a caper, Vice is a lesson in American civics disguised as a political biopic. Thanks to Donald Trump, Presidential power and its limits are big questions at the moment, and the current incumbent haunts this film like a ghost. With every venal move Cheney and his cohorts make, you can feel the whole American system lurch one step closer to the disaster it's now mired in - and McKay gleefully suggests it deserves its current humiliation.",

So whatever your views are on Cheney's beliefs, the creators of this film have made it so he doesn't have any. This is a political film about someone with no political beliefs. The 2D devil horned man on the films poster is exactly who this is about.2) \"Cheney had the ability to say crazy things but make them sound reasonable\" the film tells you. This is shown by Cheney suggesting \"they get their penises out on the lawn of the White House and use them as puppets\" in a very serious tone. It never actually shows you any time Cheney has done this in real life. It is just telling you Cheney is bad.And this second theme runs entirely through the film. George W Bush (played by Sam Rockwell in a manner very similar to his role as the crazy southern rapist in The Green Mile) asks Cheney to be his running mate for President as he lacks experience. Cheney agrees as long as he is given more power & responsiblity.... DO YOU SEE HOW EVIL THIS IS!?! DO YOU!?! If like me you failed to see how this simple deal is \"bad\" the film cuts to a fishing bait in the water, which is even stranger considering Bush went to Cheney and not the other way round.Simple occurrences are continually painted as evil or corrupt (when Bush wins the White House it shows how \"they quickly put their people into positions of power in Washington\" in an animation that includes every character in red and black in a dark storm with flashing lighting.... Doesnt every new administration put new people into power?)The film never really puts any accusations forwards and never does anything to support what it says. It's really just a poor roast of their own character.The 2D character that they've painted devil horns on is bad... cant you see the devil horns?",

Namely, a minimum tertiary education degree and proof they have absolutely no links to any Big Business before, during and even after their terms! If we had these requirements we'd not have to suffer the Pauline Hanson's and Dumb Trump's of this wicked world!

            "content": "11 February 2019\nSecond Film of Choice at The Plaza Dorchester Tonight - Vice. Films about history and especially political history are by very definition part fact, part fiction. Nobody can know what goes on in a person's head, and very few people reveal what is said behind closed doors. The public is told only the facts they want you to know and yet films of this ilk are regularly produced and we go and sit through them. As a film this offering was ok. It was compelling to watch and the cast, especially Christian Bale took on the persona of their characters extremely well. I took a look at a Dick Cheney interview and think he must have spent a lot of hours studying his mannerisms because to me they seemed spot on. This film is the story of Dick Cheney's rise to the position of Vice President of the United States of America and how he gathered a team around him to be the kind of man he was. A superb performance from Amy Adams as his wife Lynne, and Steve Carell playing Donald Rumsfeld, but my hat goes off to Sam Rockwell for his portrayal of George W Bush. He nailed it 100%. If you like films about the political history of the USA this is an interesting watch. I thoroughly recommend you give it a go.",

            "content": "Vice tries to tell the story of Dick Cheney, named ' the most influential vice-president in American history'. At the end of the film, we've seen all the major events that he was involved in, but at the same time we're no closer to understanding his character. There's little to no underlying motivation to his actions, and while this is preambled in the beginning title screens, indicating that Cheney is a secretive person so they don't know everything, I feel like the movie could have spend more time trying to understand his character. I do understand the minefield this is, since any motivations would be leaning towards a personal (and probably not very favorable) interpretation, most likely with a liberal bias. It therefore tried to stick to (a still politicized version of) the 'facts' , trying to educate the audience in that manner.In that sense, the movie succeeds. Above all, it's a very well-made movie. It's slick and stylish, just like McKay's previous movie The Big Short. The editing is smooth, the performances are obviously great, and the writing sheds a light on all the actions that make Dick Cheney (and his comerades) the war criminal that he factually is. This is a story that cannot be told often enough, lest we forgot just how despicable some of the actions undertaken by certain members of government truly are.However, by sticking to the 'facts' and not trying to understand the person behind the actions, the movie feels cold and the story better off in a documentary in the same style. The movie does try to sprinkle little bits of personality and emotion here and there, particularly relating to Cheney's gay daughter. These moments are however few and far inbetween, making you think 'oh yeah that's right, I almost forgot this was a thing they were dealing with' instead of it being a focal point of Cheney's personality and motivation.This is a problem you run into more often with such political stories, most recently in 'The Report' that also looked at the post 9-11 actions of the government, shedding a light on America's (il)legal torture practices instead. They're so focused on conveying all the information that the characterization gets undersnowed. This is particularly egregious if the movie spans a very large timespan, like Vice did. It probably would have helped the movie if it only focused on one aspect of his career/life, like his actual vice presidency, and give this more time to breathe rather than trying to tell everything all at once.Overall, Vice is a movie worth seeing just for being reminded of the disgraceful post 9-11 actions of the American government, and the great performances, particularly by an unrecognizable Christian Bale. Just don't expect a layered dramatic movie, but rather a series of stylishly edited and narrated highlight reels of Cheney and friends.",

And can we appreciate yet another fantastic weight change of Christian Bale himself?\nHe plays Dick Cheney in * different ages.Opening with an explanation continuing with Chaney's DUI arrest, film takes a very quick transition to 2001 and a clear proof of Cheney's authority.Same as the movie's pause, let's pause here and appreciate the \"narrator's presence\" in the narrative.Flashbacks and forwards are quick, clear and informative.\nAfter an anonymous, yet powerful quote that probably best describes Cheney's character, rolls the introduction and one will see a lot of familiar names. Oscar winners Sam Rockwell and Amy Adams, and oscar nominees Steve Carell, and Naomi Watts [won't actually show up here].Depicting here are the powerful elements of Chaney's life. A very good introduction to his life in a short time.\nSo far, movie has done a great job creating a back story/introduction for the later powerful vice president Cheney.Epic music accompanying the Cheetah chasing the Gazelle, with paused smile of Christian Bale, implying the victory and goal achieving spirit of Cheney is clearly another introduction.The heart problem scene, after clearly showing Dick's lack of abilities as a public speaker, proving once again what had already been shown many times; Dick was the power in the shadows. Now, it's time for Amy Adams' Lynne Cheney to shine.Dick, as the story tells us, was a family man, loved his wife and kids and, wasn't a sexist at all; in fact, he relied on his wife more than himself.\nReagan's \"making America great again\" is really familiar, isn't it?As a republican, known for their disapprove of homosexual marriage, Cheney's support of her daughter is adorable. His wife wisely points out that's going to make things harder for Cheney.I loved the early credit rolls, wishful thinking, and a simple what would have happened if he had stayed out of politics because of her daughter. very clever and unique.\nAlso, the switch to Shakespearian narrations with a literal switch.Later on, the double standard of republicans shows itself in Bush's words. \"The line is drawn in concrete\" as Bale put it, once again emphasizes the family loving spirit of Cheney. Then again, the epic music of victory.I can't talk enough about the \"restaurant\" scene and the menu metaphors. So, to say it one word: fantastic.From this scene forward I'm too shocked to write anything. So, just watch in silence and peace.\nEdit in the movie is fantastic, drastically mixing real footage with the new \"reenacted\" ones.Story telling is one of a kind. It's not shedding light on history, yet tells it with an exciting twist.\nMusic is not significantly good, but it's enough.All in all, it's worth watching. You're probably gonna enjoy the actings a lot!, they're quite perfect. And, we have already talked about the well-deserved Oscar winning makeup of the film.",

I thought George Bush was responsible for the Iraq war, not Chaney and Donald Rumsfeld as Vice suggests. The movie almost depicts Bush as a halfwit, as played by Sam Rockwell. In Britain our prime minister Tony Blair has been forever accused of taking our country into the Iraq war and acting as Bush's poodle, not Chaney's. Chaney played here by a usually compelling Christian Bale is like a cardboard cut out with one expression, grunting out of the side of his mouth. His ambitious but long suffering wife played by Amy Adams on the other hand is much more believable. I guess for American audiences, this makes some sense but unless you're a student of American politics, I imagine the average British viewer will be as baffled as I was. Although billed as a comedy, not understanding it meant that I found zero amusement in any of it and only kept watching as I normally like the leading actors. I've seen two really bad movies recently, this one and BlackkKlansman and I can't decide which was worse although Vice maybe takes the honour. Commentators say that it's just a piss take against Republicans, which I can accept, but it's probably best to leave the movie in America and not show it Britain as I don't think many Brits will understand it, particularly the fake ending about 45 minutes in. I thought someone has got the movie cut up wrong like in the old days at the cinema when the projectionist got his reels mixed up like when I went to see Superman 3 and couldn't make head or tail of it. I stopped Vice when this happened and ran the movie to the end and back again to try to figure out what the hell happened and by this time it was completely ruined anyway.",

Taking into consideration dramatization of course, McKay helms and pens a sublime dramedy / biopic. All the actors deliver superb performances. In particular Bale, Adams, Carell and Rockwell are superlative. Bale's portrayal and transformation as Cheney is mesmerizing. He is known for his method acting and he does not disappoint. I thought I was watching a live broadcast on Fox news. Rockwell's portrayal of former President Bush is formidable as he conveys some droll and daft idiosyncrasies to the role. Carell nails it as Rumsfeld whom Cheney fondly refers to as Rummy. I do want to mention the very talented Plemons for his narration and his role as Cheney's sort of savior, Kurt. The plot revolves around Cheney's rise to power being driven and inspired by his wife Lynne portrayed by Adams. The film starts by giving some backstory of Cheney as being a more or less everyday average Joe Lunchbucket. He has a penchant for alcohol and works labor intensive jobs for as long as he can stand it. Lynne has a heart to heart and more or less lays it on the line, ship up or ship out. Rummy takes Cheney under his wing and teaches him the ropes. We find he teaches Cheney all to well. Eventually Cheney becomes one of the most, behind the scenes, powerful leaders in American history. Like it or not his ability to manipulate everyone around him and this includes other powerful politicians is absolutely masterful. His tactics are symbolic of a master chess player or in Cheney's case a master fly fisherman. Whether the viewer approves of the moves or not, his political influence was brilliant and outright disturbing at the same time. The plot is witty, clever, insightful, revealing, intelligent, ingenious, exceptional and has a cathartic ending. There is plenty of symbolism and political examination in this film. My favorite scene hands down is when Cheney and Bush are enjoying a cookout at the ranch. Cheney subtly and easily has Bush hand him over the keys to the proverbial driver's seat like a puppet on a string. Better yet Bush falls for Cheney's pitch hook, line and sinker. And the rest is history as they say. I enjoyed this film as much, if not more than McKay's \"The Big Short\". If McKay's intention was to take a pop shots at certain political figures, it may just have backfired mostly due to the powerhouse performances. It really depends on how the viewer interprets the film, meaning is it accepted as a dramedy or taken personal. As a matter of fact Cheney uses a lot of loose interpretation to move his political agenda forward in the film. If you decide to indulge, try to set your political beliefs aside and enjoy the ride. Lastly, hang on through the credits. It's worth it.",

With Bale, Ms. Adams, Carell and Rockwell, the movie had awards potential written all over it from the start but the pacing, direction, post-production was just not in line with the story of the man they were talking about.

From the opening crawl, to the mid-credits scene, to the melodramatic moments when they truly feel they have something worth telling (Mary's wallowing over Liz's stance on same-sex marriage flip-flop stands out), the direction was overly reaching (read:desperate) trying to find something on a man who was as he is: boring. The man's hobby was fly-fishing... I mean c'mon...There were either two ways to go (or both) and the reality is Lynne was the much more engaging character (Ms. Adams could have had a better chance of winning more trophys than Bale, though they were all equally excellent). Focusing 80% on her would have resonated better, and then McKay should have given up the autobiographical accounts to a more satirical look of the White House (fiction, non-fiction, wouldn't matter) in his own style. It's never too late with this current administration, but thank God Christian Bale carried the character, from beginning to end, as it was very wise to add that closing monologue, to let Cheney tee off, if you will. A last look of a perspective that Cheney himself would begrudgingly shrug off, probably. But Bale did a great job, overall.",

            "content": "As Adam McKay's follow-up to The Big Short (one of my favorite films of 2015) he is back with another dark satirical comedy.Just like in The Big Short, the amount of information McKay throws at you is a little overwhelming, especially if you don't fully understand it. It is a little slower paced of a movie, but the way he frames every scene has such gusto that you can't take your eyes off the screen.Other than the brilliant script the main thing to note in this movie is the perfect casting. Christian Bale and Amy Adams teaming up again, this time as Dick and Lynne Cheney further prove they should team up in every movie together. Christian Bale is so believable as Dick Cheney that you suddenly forget that you are even watching Bale at all. Then you have Steve Carell as Donald Rumsfeld, Sam Rockwell as George W. Bush, Tyler Perry as Colin Powell, Naomi Watts, Lily Rabe, Jesse Plemons (in a role that I did NOT see coming), and plenty more.There is a fantastic scene between Lynne and Dick where Plemons' character narrating notes - that we wouldn't know what they actually would have said in this certain moment, but he images it would be something quite Shakespearian. Then Lynne and Dick start talking like they are in Macbeth. Their chemistry is just fantastic and you get to see how much Lynne stepped up, and her ambitions and reservations with going into this political world.As much as this movie paints Cheney as a villain, McKay still gave him depth and compassionate moments, and showing all of his health troubles. You really see how this man became the most powerful VP that we have ever had in the history of the U.S. Presidency and how scary that is because it is all true. We have lived it.This movie is definitely not for everyone but I really enjoyed it. There is a funny after credits scene that shows how divided our country is, and the quote above is exactly what you should be asking yourself at the end of the movie. So, what do we believe?",

            "content": "The first time I watched Vice (of which I had almost no interest in until I saw its inclusion in the 2019 edition of 1,001 Movies You Must See Before You Die), I expected a conventionally flat piece of Oscar bait (it was up for best picture). Sometimes, it's good to be wrong. And on second watch, it's still just as damn good. Despite knowing all the many, many historical inaccuracies and flat-out fabrications Adam McKay makes, It's a damn fine piece of entertainment (same reason why people watch Braveheart, it sure as hell ain't about period accuracy). An unconventional, almost parody take on the biopic, its constantly meta, fourth-wall breaking nature (cut-away gags (torture on the menu), fake-out happy ending halfway through, a Shakespearian scene in the bedroom, a funny twist with Jesse Plemons' voice-over narrator, Dick Cheney (Christian Bale) snarlingly addressing the audience at the end) makes a farce out of the Bush Whitehouse in perhaps much the same way that Armando Iannuci's Death of Stalin (2017) took the piss out of post-Stalinist Russia. Adam McKay's follow-up after his brilliant The Big Short (2015), this quasi-biopic on Dick Cheney follows him from inconspicuous redneck blue-collar roots in middle America to devious mastermind behind some of the Bush administration's most dubious policies (again, cartoonishly embellished and played up for drama). Someone had pointed out, and rightfully so, that some parts feel as though we're only seeing half the movie, what with the way we breeze through a lot of plot points (the cut scenes are worth checking out, especially the deleted war bunker scene) and things certainly feel fudged toward the end and it feels that we arrive at Cheney's closing bad-guy soliloquay rather abruptly. Fair enough, but when that's the worst of it, there's not terribly much to detract. Bale plays the snarky character with plenty of tongue-in-cheek sarcasm and McKay rounds out the cast with Amy Adams, Steve Carrel, Tyler Perry, Sam Rockwell and a plethora of other recognizable faces, all of whom bounce off each other more-or-less pretty well in this zany, flippant, and irreverantly self-aware political satire.",

These elements are stunning: Bale transformed his body for this role and he practiced a fleer that is so uncomfortable because it is a mix between a simle and an expression of deprise. The direction by Adam McVay was really good, using a lot of visual similes and metaphores and the editing put them all togheter with perfect timing, making some of them highly momorable.\nUnfortunately it's not all perfect. In fact the biggest problem was the missing sense of the movie, not because is something cerebral but because it raises a question: \"what was the point of doing this film?\". I'm not from the US so I'm not into the American politics and its propaganda, which I felt was the main aspect of the movie. Because otherwise is a film about the cruelty of human beings, in particular of Dick Cheney, but if the message wanted to be this one there could be other numerous better subjects to base a film on.\nIn conclusion I liked the film, and particular its direction that was unique but at the end of the day it gave me nothing, except for the fact that Dick Cheney was a very ruthless man.",

The editing is the biggest weak point of this film with the structure & narration being the 2nd & 3rd. Jesse Plemons, as good as he is was not needed in this movie and at during the 2nd hour of the film his scenes are a drag. The best thing about this film is that it showed Dick Cheney and his wife for the terrible people they are in an uncompromising way which will surely piss off a lot of conservatives. Donald Rumsfield was shown as some supposed person with a sense of humour which he definitely wasn't and Adam McKay should have avoided that at all costs. At the end of the day, Vice is a decent biography but still a disappointment and certainly not a \"Comedy\" in any way. It thoroughly lacked the liveliness and dialogue of Big Short.",

Unfortunately the filmmaking lets 'Vice' down.

It doesn't know if it wants to be played satirical, comedic, or serious and ultimately horrific, leading to a blend of tone and styles that makes for uneven picture. The other thing is that it is definitely a film of two-halves. For the first half, it takes the shape of a more basic biopic of Cheney's life and how he came to have so much power. This portion of the piece is very slow-moving and ultimately quite un-engaging, despite McKay's attempts to diversify the genre. Thankfully, though, once the second half arrives, things get a lot more interesting as it is here where McKay's voice is heard and the film's purpose comes into play. During this portion, it is considerably more interesting, engaging and ultimately memorable. It's never a bad film by any means, but it had the potential to be a lot better. 6/10",

            "content": "Christian Bale's very convincing performance can't save the train wreck that is \"Vice\", the movie about the rise and fall of American vice president Dick Cheney. The movie is all over the place, in more than one aspect. Lots of daring artistic choices were made, but they didn't add anything to it. They were more like an attempt to make the boring bland movie desperately stand out. Which it didn't.As mentioned before, Vice tries to give deeper meaning to itself by making very weird editing choices that don't add anything to the story, but are presented as if they are some great symbolism. A first example is in how they randomly pause the movie on very awkward moments to then narrate some information over the still. This is of course a very genius idea, if you don't know how to give the viewer information through a movie. Just narrate some text over a still and your problem is fixed. This doesn't work at all, and to make things worse, after having done this for almost the entire first half, the movie decides to barely use it anymore in their second half, as if they have learned. That's not everything though. We also get treated with some beautiful stock footage of bombings and other shocking things throughout the entire movie, because apparently the movie can't shoot scenes that are impactful on itself. This scene doesn't make people have intense emotional feelings? Let's show them some imagery of bombings in Iraq. That should work. In the prologue and the after credits scene (yes this movie has an after credits scene and it's worse than the whole movie combined) it gives some commentary on how people don't care about politics and the people who lead their country; after finding out their movie is exactly about that, they tried to fix the fact that people would be bored with all their weird, interesting, experimental editing choices. It didn't work. It made weird mess of a movie, and not in a good way.The film tries to fit in subtle comedy on various occasions; the problem with that is that it actually isn't subtle at all and makes the whole movie just very weird and confusing instead of funny. Which makes it ultimately funny too, but not in the way the creators wanted it I believe. The tone of the movie is very unclear, because it tackles serious subjects and just sometimes adds a very dumb gag straight out of a forgettable late night comedy. In one scene Cheney's heart attack is treated very seriously, then in another scene he is having a heart attack again but it is more used as a joke? I'm not sure what kind of film they were trying to make, and I'm sure the director still isn't sure of that either.One of the few redeeming qualities of the movie is in the first place the incredible performance of Christian Bale who totally transforms into Dick Cheney. He does an amazing job in immersing himself into the role and you really can't deny he does it with so much class. Steve Carell does a surprisingly great job as Donald Rumsfeld as well, and he deserves some extra credit for being the only person who can actually pull of some of the comedy in this movie. On the other hand, Amy Adam's performance as Cheney's wife is horrible. I cringed at almost every scene she was in. I'm sure this also has to do with bad writing, which brought a lot of the supporting actors and extra's down, but her role as a strong woman who basically made Cheney didn't have the power it should've behind it. It was as if a cute elderly lady tried to impersonate Margaret Thatcher. Very embarrassing. I feel really bad for her that this awful performance is captured on film forever. I can comfort her a bit by saying the theatre I was in was almost empty though.Also,this is very personal, but I really liked the score. I feel like it lifted up some of the scenes that desperately needed that epic music behind it to be able to be taken at least a bit serious. Also I can't deny that the hair and make-up in this film are phenomenal, especially Bale's transformation is done perfectly. That, together with some good acting feats is really everything I can give this movie unfortunately.It wasn't as boring as I was expecting this to be. I thought it would be a boring political biopic, and what I got was a disaster of a movie that's all over the place. It was not only a boring political biopic. It also tried to be an art movie. And a comedy. It tried to be everything. And I'm still not sure what it exactly is. I can say one thing for sure. It isn't good.",

I can't recommend this movie for any other reason though and it doesn't seem to have much truth in the movie. Perhaps the person who wrote this should stick to non-political movies.",

The real film starts in that same vein, but ends up being a slogging leftist dreamscape with pandering undertones of agenda-fueled propaganda. It begins like a film centered around Cheney's mystique, and ends as a film that wants to burn him alive and bury the ashes. The end-credits scene is especially distasteful, as it takes one last final jab at right-leaning America.

Yes, the movie is slanted a little left. But again you take that with a grain of salt. Looking back at the 2001 attacks on the World Trades Center, Vice-President Chaney really believed that he was doing the right thing by going after Saddam Hussein under the guise of Weapons of Mass Destruction. Later learning that another maniacal terrorist Osama bin Laden, was responsible for the attack. For eight years Chaney kept tight control of the events and people around him including his boss, George W. Bush. Little did anyone realize that the vacuum created in the Middle East by eliminating one tyrant made room for ISIS to fill-in.Whether or not the events depicted in the movie happened, is up for interpretation. If you are a liberal, you will love the film. A conservative will hate the film calling it a bunch of lies. For me it was entertaining. I recognized a couple of facts, which to me, was spot on. I also learned some things as well. I am hoping that our current president does not get wind of some of these things because then we will be in a lot of hurt.

The move he suggested his daughter make when she ran in Wyoming with her public opinion about gay marriage not being supported was harsh, especially backstabbing to his other daughter.

Other than the known public events, I have no way of judging the accuracy of the dramatisation in the movie, but the movie structure and pace left a crystal clear message, loud and clear, without actually making an attempt to explicitly state it. Could laws or parts of laws that infringe on unitary executive power just simply be ignored?The overall performances in the movie are very good indeed with the visual likening of the characters to the real individuals being quite remarkable.A movie that could stand the test of time as a potentially curious historical reminder of the significant events during the George W Bush era.",

This movie also villainizes all the republican administrations, going back to Gerald Ford. It is against the war in Iraq. It lifts the blame of terrorism off of the terrorists and places it on the Republicans. This movie is total garbage. Much of the acting is bad. The casting is bad.

            "content": "Even better than All The Presidents Men!Reportedly, the Cheney family, Lynne and Liz at least, were angry at the portrayal of husband & father Dick. The movie pulls no punches, but it IS objective enough - it could even be taken as a compliment, which someone of Dick's character and personality (Myers-Briggs INTJ) no doubt did. After all, he even referred to himself as Darth Vader, an appellation his detractors often used. On camera, he relished in controversy and hate, standing his ground even more firmly. And who wouldn't love a biopic? No other V-P in history has had one, unlike numerous Presidents. Cheney was, of course, the most powerful in history, serving a weak (minded) President.I love period pieces, and everything in this is accurately portrayed. The only reason that I deduct -1 star is that there are some segments of farce when the filmmakers apparently ran out of incisive scenes to link points in time. There are also great moments of deadpan hilarity which may be poetic license since no one other than the principals could possibly know what was said, and they have never done so - not even in rebuttal to this movie. I was also surprised that Colin Powell was slightly slandered given his usual affection from the Left (which the filmmakers obviously are).I must add that the sequences portraying 9/11 are some of the most revealing and exciting of any covering that day. Also, there is a parallel fictional story tying the truth to a perspective on Cheney's morality. I won't elaborate, but unless you keep an open mind and are knowledgeable enough, it can be deceptive. I think some might be fooled into believing it.That is perhaps one aspect of this movie though that works better than most: if you are well versed in US history post-Kennedy, then this is a wonderful trip down memory lane, either as a supporter of US politics in general, or are partisan and have a deep disdain for Republicans.",

The movie stars Christian Bale as Dick Chenny and god! This guy's a chameleon , I don't think I would've recognized him as the part if I'd watched the movie without knowing. Amy Addams plays his wife , Steve carrel plays Donald Rumsfeld and Sam Rockwell plays George bush and I thought all the performances were brilliant and had enough moments to shine despite the ensemble cast. The story is a biopic of Dick Cheney and the majority of it focuses on his time as the vice president and how he used George bush as a puppet. The problem I had with this movie were the flash forwards , like a time jump from an ongoing scene and a few jumpcuts , I felt that made the movie seem more like a docu drama than a regular movie . That being said , this movie was really interesting , it showed stuff like the rise of a secret society inside the oval office , Cheney's rise to power , manipulating public and lots of really smart stuff. And kudos to this movie for not whitewashing Cheney. In the end , Vice was what I thought it was gonna be , it has great performances , an insight into the war on Iraq , Cheney's ideals , inside stories and one really fat Christian bale. It's one of the best political movies I've seen since Ides of March.",

This film which posed in a documentary style was way too ambitious by its own admission - 22,000 white house emails and the entire lifetime of a man boiled down to 90mins.I would have implored the executive producers to tease it out properly and make a real documentary that could have been credible to their agenda. I have no problem with scriptwriters wanting to offer a perspective but this attempt was neither art or documentary narrative it was what we now class as infotainment which basically makes everyone slightly more ignorant.Some points to consider...* Awkward B roll that was simulated to be original and if you're not political may have passed to be the real thing.\n* A fictional voice-over to keep the story moving and be compelling.\n* Juxtaposed formats between film and doco\n* Taking out Saddam was not a new idea and the dictators body count of murdering his own people was purposely overlooked and vital to know.\n* Executive clearly exposed their own liberal bias that they call it out themselves in the outro didn't work.\n* Prolonged montage of heart surgery as a metaphor. Gruesome and not clever.\n* Having enormous personal wealth is a frailty of the system that rampantly allows it in America and anyone give the opportunity would do the same stepping in and out of the private sector.\n* Politicians are not moral arbitrators like Hollywood expects them to be, they legislate in the interests of the majority that voted for them and held accountable by an opposition Party.\n* The gay marriage issue was overplayed, as has become politically correct. The greater truth is every congressman and parliamentarian around the world tailors a message to win local elections in their constituency.\n* You shouldn't have outed yourselves in the very opening credits by telling us 'you did your best' lol",

            "content": "The trailer for Vice was amazing. Those are probably the best performances of the film all rolled into a neat little package. The released film, not so impressive. Some of the acting takes seem a bit improvised or unrehearsed with weird repetition from the actors. I found it a little difficult to sit through at times. I suspect a lot of the problem is the editing, though, as I assume they had enough takes that there was good stuff available and the right ingredients for something that would really work if you cut it all down differently or with more rhythm on the micro scale. I wasn't a fan of the use of narration here at all. It even felt like a film that had also been drastically re-edited in structure on the macro scale multiple times, possibly with additional shoots, and was somehow still not quite getting its final-cut-footing in either respect. I obviously could be wrong about that.There are two brilliant moments at about 49 minutes and 59 minutes-in that gave me a second wind for a little while after feeling that this was a sinking ship. I did like the presence of footage showing what the majority of Americans were preoccupied with at the time of key events. They tryed to be pretty accurate on most scenes where we have existing footage or accounts of. Many will disagree with me, but I don't think any mention of the gay daughter at all was appropriate or relevant to the larger concerns of the film.There was a little info I hadn't heard before and appreciated, like on ISIS and Bin Laden's mother, but also some juicy morsels absent. No mention of Cheney looking into expanding domestic NSA surveillance before 9/11, the combat air controllers having no intention of carrying out his order to shoot down airliners (it must come direct from POTUS and can't be delegated), or the organization of his illegal SAP hit team that was apparently never activated, for instance. There's very little about the mass expansion of the use of contractors. It's curious what they chose to include and leave out. Perhaps if you know very little about this era and him, it will have a bigger emotional impact when you hear the somewhat-limited revelations they've haphazardly and not-so-subtlety slapped together within a not-entirely-compelling and sloppily-executed narrative.",

It simply remains a way for the filmmakers to mostly show off. Other than that this is a fairly interesting and enjoyable bio pic of an interesting and controversial political figure. The performances are damn good. Bale completely becomes Cheny, disappearing in the role, gaining all the wight, nailing the mannerisms. He is one of our best method actors, and his efforts come off nicely here. Amy Adams is great as usual and Chenys wife. The story, I'm not sure how much of this is reality to how it readily went down, it being a Hollywood film I will have to go ahead and assume some liberties were taken. Nonetheless, it is interesting to see how this man played behind the scenes and how he rose to power and all he manipulated in the office. It does play out in a way that makes you gnereally curois about this man, and we see his home life to, but not much, it is all played in mystery.Another problem I had with the movie is it is a little manipulative itself, and mixed in its delivery. It does try to paint Cheny in a grey light for the most part, which is the best way to do it truthfully, but sometimes we do get a bit of a forced narrative that points to leftist political agenda. Also the tone is a little inconsistent. With it sometimes wanting to be a satire, even with some meta humor, yet also it has some serious dramatic moments, these were not evenly distributed enough for me in all honestly.Overall, this is a good. Movie, it made me curious about it's source and are me compliment most of the efforts that went into making it. A flawed one to be sure, but worth a watch id say.",

The film features great cinematography and many stylized moments throughout the movie. The pacing was well done and the established world grows with the characters in the film. The humor in it is very well placed and simultaneously serves as allegory. The film was well written. The dialogue is natural.

I found myself in awe early on as Bale nailed a lot of Cheney's speech and mannerisms; only later was I able to see Bale coming through from time to time. Amy Adams is a solid counterpart. Rockwelll and Carell do a stand-up job to boot.While I realize it is popular, I'm not sure how I feel about jumping back and forth in time and feel I do prefer a more linear approach - although the scene where Cheney arrives at the White House for the transition of the Bush administration and thinks back to where he came from was poignant. I also feel mixed in how so many serious historical events are doused with comedic relief; yes parts caught me having a laugh, but I also found myself taken aback as to why I was finding the subject funny.Ultimately I left the theater tonight with no regret... Though I do think they left out a crucial scene during the events on 9/11 where the Secretary of Transportation, Norman Mineta, testified before the 9/11 Commision that, as flight 77 approached the Pentagon, Cheney was asked by an aide, \"Do the orders still stand?\", to which Cheney confirmed - and the Pentagon was hit. This also never made it into the 9/11 Commission Report and the exchange was recreated and reinterpreted by two Washington Compost writers. In the end, did I learn anything new? No. But I thoroughly enjoyed seeing Bale take that role on.",

There have already been many cine biographies of politicians of the past and current time, but the originality of the VICE narrative has rarely or almost never been met.Starting with the storyteller's brilliant choice, how to tell it, alternating scenes from the past and the present, real scenes, supposed discoveries or absolutely fictional things, VICE completely innovated the genre, creating a difficult framework to overcome. Even Sheakspeare's dialogues are used by the script brilliantly.Christian Bale in the role of Vice President Dick Cheney is simply stunning, not only by physical transformation, but by the adoption of every gestural (even facial) of the real character.Amy Adams, Sam Rockwell, Steve Carell, Alison Pill, Lisa Gay Hamilton, Tyler Perry and spectacular special appearances by Naomi Watts and Alfred Molina make a first-rate cast to take the story of the film.A creative and modern film, VICE does not shy away from giving its opinion on the facts it portrays. But it also gives voice to those who think differently, at various times, notably in the extraordinary scene in which the protagonist addresses the viewer, justifying his actions. Superb moment of high level cinema.The post-credits scene is equally conceived and realized in a remarkable way, deserving a separate discussion.For all this, VICE is inscribed on the first level of modern political cinema.",

            "content": "I am not a fan of the great man/villain theory of history, but the writer/director of this movie, Adam Mckay (nominated for Academy Awards both Best Director and Best Original Screenplay) obviously is. He blames former Vice-President Dick Cheney (Christian Bale) above all others for the state of the world today. The movie starts in 1963 after Cheney has flunked out of Yale twice because of his drinking. After two arrests for drunk driving back home in Wyoming, his fianc\u00e9 Lynne Vincent (Amy Adams) gives him an ultimatum telling him to give up drinking or break off their engagement. Then the movie follows his life in mostly chronological order and is narrated by a man (Jesse Plemons) whose identity is not revealed until the end. After marrying Lynne and attending the Universities of Wyoming and Wisconsin, he becomes a congressional intern and the prot\u00e9g\u00e9 of then Illinois congressman Donald Rumsfeld (Steve Carrell), a White House staffer during the Nixon administration, chief of staff of the White House for Gerald Ford (Bill Camp), congressman for Wyoming during the Carter and Reagan, and Secretary of Defense for George H.W. Bush (John Hilner). During the Clinton administration, Cheney become the CEO of the Halliburton Corporation, a big oil field services company. When George W. Bush (Sam Rockwell) became the Republican nominee for President in 2000, he asked Cheney to run for Vice-President. Cheney agreed with an agreement that he would be given much more power than any other Vice-President in U.S. history. Since Bale and several of the other actors did not resemble the characters they portrayed (Tyler Perry's hair had to be whitened for him to play Colin Powell, for example), they underwent heavy make-up, and this film was the Oscar winner in that category.\nThe film does not shy away from Cheney's domestic life either. When she was in high school, his younger daughter Mary (Alison Pill) came out as gay. According to the movie, he was much more accepting of her sexual orientation than Lynne. Another part of his agreement with the younger Bush was that he would not only fail to support anti-gay legislation, such as outlawing gay marriages, but would say in public that he was in favor of gay marriage. Toward the very end, it does show a rift between the younger daughter and the older daughter Liz (Lily Rabe) when the latter ran for public office in Wyoming and opposed gay marriage. Liz is currently a member of the U.S. House of Representatives.\nWhile the general outline of the events were consistent with my memories, the filmmakers make such an issue that this is an accurate portrayal of the title character that I consulted the web site \"History vs. Hollywood\" and found that they got a lot of details wrong. There is no evidence that Lynne Cheney's father murdered her mother, which the film implies; Cheney had strong conservative beliefs before he ever arrived in Washington, D.C., although the film states that he only became a Republican after his arrival; Cheney's conversation with future Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia about presidential powers was pure fiction; the Fairness Doctrine for broadcast news never applied to Fox News, which is a cable channel; Cheney was hardly an unknown when he was running for Vice-President (I first read about him when he was Ford's chief of staff), especially since he had already been Secretary of Defense; Cheney was not the one who authorized the shooting down of hijacked planes on 9/11, that was President Bush; he did not receive a $26 million severance package when he resigned from Halliburton to become Vice-President, that money was from his exercise and sale of stock options; Libby Scooter did not leak the identity of C.I.A. agent Valerie Plame to the press under orders from Cheney, that was Richard Armitage under his own initiative; and blaming Cheney for the creation of ISIS was absurd. Overall this is a very entertaining movie, but unlikely to change any minds about Cheney's place in history.",

            "content": "VICE\nVICEAdam McKay's Vice is a 2 hour and 12 minute SNL sketch (McKay is an alum of that show) - with better make-up and actors.The movie follows former Vice-President (under Bush II) Dick Chaney from his wildwood days in Wyoming (two DUIs) to the White House. The journey is long, with stints as Chief of Staff (Ford), Congressman and Secretary of Defense (Reagan). The overall theme is that but for his wife, Lynn, Chaney would have been a drunken cowboy with a serious heart problem.The acting is superb. As Chaney, Christian Bale projects a man willing to do anything to get what he wants. Amy Adams as his wife, Lynn Chaney, keeps her husband's ambition on track as Lady Macbeth. Steve Carell as Dick Rumsfeld is as smarmy as the original. Sam Rockwell as Bush II brings the lights-on-but-nobody's-home quality to a President defined by his being the puppet for whatever special interests happen to see him last. Tyler Perry as Colin Powell is more a cameo than a role played by an actor whose name is above the title.What Chaney wants is power. One of the flicks themes is how Chaney & Company pushed a theory called 'The Unified Executive', a nebulous phrase that really is just old The Imperial Presidency dressed up to sound legal. The argument is simple and best expressed by Richard Nixon who famously said, \"If the President does it, then it's legal.\"McKay tells the story of the rise of Chaney with the tools used mostly in TV comedy sketches. For example, when discussing the run-up to the Iraqi War, we see Chaney and his minions at dinner when the waiter (Alfred Molina, uncredited) goes through a menu listing all of the crazy constitutional theories they put out to justify their illegal acts. The scene ends with Chaney saying that they will have all of them - of course.Vice tries to be a real biography when it shows Chaney supporting his gay daughter (Alison Pill in a role as small as her name) even though he and his supporters have been virulently anti-gay. I am not sure where this part of the story goes because when his other daughter , Liz (Lily Rabe) runs for Congress and says she is against gay marriage, we see his gay daughter call Chaney and cry that she has been betrayed. This incident shows us a lot that is wrong about Vice. Liz is a grown woman yet Vice wants you to believe that her father made this decision for her,Vice is about an 45 minutes too long. All the stuff before the Bush II years is just a set up to show us how Chaney & Company took the US to war in Iran (the movie claims it was for PR reasons - huh?) and destroyed the US constitution's check and balances form of government. While the movie has some interesting quirks - the menu bit and others that are based on the techniques used in sketch comedy - it is far from a scathing portrait of how the US ended up where it is, scorned by most of the world and a plutocracy. There are some laughs and surprises, like any good comedy sketch, but nothing that is worth 2 hours and 12 minutes of our time.FOR MORE GREAT REVIEWS GO TO:\nITSJUSTAMOVIE.COM",

While not having anything new to say to the American people, least of all the idiosyncrasies of Governmental Agents, it is able to reach out more by presenting Dick Cheney in a supporting and thoughtful way.\nIt distances itself from tragedy beautifully as it tries to portray the Pentagon's troublesome history in dealing with ultras and corrupt regimes. Whether or not this is derived from the script is not yet known but does work for the movie as a whole.Christian Bale stands up to the task and delivers his best though failing in some aspects.The film is a desperate attempt to share a home perspective and will go against the mediocre, even known knowns who claim to be very interested in the developing story of American foreign policy. As a film Vice is a good depiction and as a report it is controversial.",

Christian Bale is always exceptional... And don't get me wrong, he's great in this too, but it's all... contorted. Kind of funny to say that for a movie...For me growing up, there was nothing more sinister than Cheney... He would in turn become to be known as the real life Emperor to our real life Darth Vader... But not so fast... Unlike in Star Wars, Cheney is you know, like a real person... And unlike the Emperor in Star Wars, this movie has to answer... Who is Cheney... In Star Wars we just have to see the bad guy laugh maniacally... and say things like \"Good... Good.\" But in Vice... we have to answer the question, who is Cheeny, and I'm afraid that despite some effort, I didn't feel I knew him any better than before I saw the movie... In fact, despite the films biased efforts... I did actually end up liking him more. Not because the film does much to portray his duality, but because I was so irritated with the actors breaking the fifth wall and telling me how to feel.It had the opposite effect.Rockwell playing W. I'm sure there is some truth to it... But W wasn't a bumbling fool, always talking about baseball, always eating chicken wings. Rockwell is fine... He even looks like W and sounds like him. But there's not a lot going on inside that mask.The movie goes onto to become quite boring. Powell becomes the most interesting character... Rumsfield, too, I've seen Rumsfield in interviews... Correll really knocks it out of the park.The most interesting part of the movie is also the most complicated and seems out of place. When the United States goes into Iraq, based off of \"intelligence\" and ends up turning a two bit drug dealer into a martyr for the Middle East... the film gets more interesting for a moment. Now, I was thinking, that's the kind of movie I want to see.Sure, Vice has its moments... But, just give me an objective film based off of facts but not a costume comedy, which tells me how to feel.Cheney could have easily been great and just OK",

I mean, it's like an undeserved revenge to the acts done by Potus and VP at that time, which are past now.\nVice targets Cheney and hits him hard with a perfectly-written satire by McKay, but that said, everyone has its political view and it's hard to blame and target Cheney hard for what have been done between 2001-2008, and tell his bad manners in a film. I thought movies were made for everyone, and it shouldn't be Hollywood's purpose to change Republicans into Democrats. This movie even brings hatred and division to some people.\nAll that said: I think Bale's work is perfect, make up artists' works were perfect. The satire itself is well-written and provocative as I think, the director wanted it to be. \"Vice\" 's message was clear but not that fair I think. It's difficult to give it 10/10 as its message can divide people and disrepect someone still alive and still living in America.",

McKay tries some experimental approaches from The Big Short and some of the set pieces worked better than others but by the end I was fatigued of them. Ultimately, I was puzzled by the theory the director posits that Dick Cheney's main motivation in life was the approval of his wife? Really???

            "content": "This confirms it: Adam McKay has moved on from directing schtick movies like Anchorman and has joined the big leagues with Vice, not just because he tackled a difficult topic - political history told (mostly) factually - but because he did it in a very, very creative way.First, the makeup was amazing; it's no surprise it earned the artists an Academy Award. It was flawless. Most notably, of course was the makeup used to \"flesh out,\" pardon the joke, the character of Dick Cheney. I don't know how accurate it was, but the care taken to make the makeup look realistic suggests that it's also very true-to-life, with age spots and other facial features closely matching those of Cheney.The casting was incredible. The physical likenesses were top-notch, especially for Cheney and Donald Rumsfeld. The acting was great, especially of course with Christian Bale. This is the kind of role he was born to play, one that requires immersion into a real person's life in order to play the part. Bale could make a very, very successful career just from playing real people.Now for the core of the film itself - the stylistic choices.Just like the Bush/Cheney administration, Vice was half comedic and half deadly serious. (Comically the two are different - Vice was satirical at times, while the Bush/Cheney administration was farcical at times.)Director McKay made some bold and wonderful choices. There were times when the story veered from a linear narrative, and sometimes those diversions \"broke the fourth wall\" in a sense. It wasn't done by having characters speak directly to the audience, but rather by taking us out of the realm of realism. This was done at times by having a fictional character, sometimes on-screen, as a narrator; sometimes it was done by thrusting major characters into fanciful scenes (the restaurant scene in which the waiter read off the specials could have been a stand-alone short film - it was genius); and sometimes it was done in other unexpected ways.The attention to detail was amazing, with things most people probably wouldn't notice being made a part of the film - for instance, as Cheney was hatching one of his real-life schemes that cost thousands of lives he was holding a knife used as a letter opener. This level of details even extends into a good part of the end credits - make sure you pay attention to the fishing flies.One thing I noticed that I'm not sure was intentional was that early in the film, before Cheney had even given up his partying days, a few shots of him or his wife, Lynne, had a fly buzzing around, which once landed on Dick Cheney's face. I'm guessing it was intentional (digital of course) because it would be unlikely that a real fly would cooperate over the course of half a dozen takes from each of at least two camera angles.If you're a film fan, you MUST watch Vice.(Note: It was fun to see the stock footage of Bush's arrival on the USS Abraham Lincoln in an S-3 Viking jet to announce, erroneously, \"Mission Accomplished\" in Iraq. I flew in Vikings as an enlisted member of the crew about six or seven years earlier. And the digital effects people did a pretty good job of inserting Sam Rockwell's face into some of that video.)",

Overtly and admittedly largely made up of imaginative innuendo designed to sell a narrative. The political bias is THICK. Just watch the post-credit clip. They try hard to stop criticism before it even starts - by labelling the side most likely to give criticism as partisan bigots. This movie so political that it's hard to take the message seriously.Everything surrounding 9/11, Osama Bin Laden, the \"War on Terror\", the invasion of Iraq and search for WMDs is suspect. Anyone with half a brain acknowledges this. But this movie is simply a political hack-job. The best lies are made up of half-truths. The facts presented in the movie are note-worthy at the very least, but they don't paint a comprehensive picture of the larger context. Obviously, the movie is mostly, if not completely about Cheney. So it simply was not made to present a larger context that would create more clarity. The movie was made to demonize a specific person - someone who is easy to demonize because he is just as morally flawed and corrupt as anyone else on this planet.Pointing the finger in a judgmental fashion is easy - especially in politics - and both political sides love to be the accusers of the other. We're just not going to allow Hollywood to self-righteously be the priests and \"whistleblowers\" of a \"righteous cause\" - because Hollywood is it's own perverse and corrupt political establishment.When Hollywood makes an equally masterful movie exploiting all the illegal, immoral, unethical, and unconstitutional decisions that Barack Obama is responsible for, as well as the deaths he is responsible for in the Middle East and Persia, THEN we MIGHT CONSIDER giving Hollywood a second chance.

The movie begins by not so kindly introducing a young Cheney, and teeters between showing him and a positive light and his more infamous \"evil\" side. At times, Vice feels drawn out and excessive, but the performances by Bale and Adams in particular draw the audience back into interest. McKay also takes the artistic liberty of allowing Bale as Cheney to monologue to the audience at the end of the movie, breaking the fourth wall, which tied up his very moving and convincing performance portraying the politician. Vice can be very engaging if the viewer is interested in the plot of the film, but others may find it quite tedious. It takes a while for the film to actually reach the Cheney vice-presidency, and in that time the movie goes back and forth between riveting scenes and superfluous montages. Although, the cast performance as a whole (Bale, Rockwell, Adams, Carell) managed to work in the movie's favor, giving it a deserving 7/10 stars.",

There is a shallow tapping of publicly available facts presented in this movie and everything else is spun, made up, or doesn't jibe. I think the shallow tapping is deliberate and very much SNL in style. So I'd call this movie a collage of overly long SNL skits that didn't make the SNL cut.A rich history of real events is passed over for a fictional co-mangling of a handful of cherry-picked vignettes such as the hunting accident, Cheney negotiating with G.W. for special V.P. privileges, Halliburton having profits while functioning on \"time and materials contracts\" during the Iraq war (when no other businesses would go there), etc. So, we have a 2\u00bc hour movie that's a fictional skew they want us to believe was the way things were \"their truth\" and why. All that misinformation and make believe is wound tightly around what few facts are represented such as Cheney's daughter being a lesbian, Cheney's order for military jets to shoot down ANY unidentified aircraft (Flight 93* was the only suspect, and Flight 93 wasn't specifically mentioned in the movie so Cheney's line could say \"ANY\").*There were no armed jets on standby anywhere in the USA at the time. FYI: The DC air space has been protected since 9-11, but three F16's did try to intercept Flight 93 in what would have been kamikaze missions.This was more like something Joel and Ethan Coen would have made and they even began Fargo with \"This is Based on a True Story\" which they admit was the first gag in that film. Where \"Vice\" parted from something the Coen's would do is there is no connective tissue here front to back, no story telling, it was just a political hack without any balance in time or space. If the Coens had made it to their standards it would have been entertaining even if contrived. The best I can say of the Makay/Ferrell version is it's pure message encased in propaganda and some folks will probably believe it, certainly the current \"not my president crowd\" and of course the gullible snow flakes and their children. If these humorists by reputation tried for humor they missed on that account as well. This is not funny material, we shouldn't have taken shock and awe to Iraq, a big mistake, but then you weren't doing any real drama in this movie.The casting people and the makeup people were great in their choices. The actors were highly capable, but they and the audience suffer under the disconnect in the writing and directing. Where truth would have made a rich canvass, reveal, and entertained us the designs of the writer-director failed. People not born in 2001 will view this as history, just as the fictional Pearl Harbor released in 2001 will be mistaken for what really happened 12/7/41.This is sadly another one of those movies where the people that made choices for the trailer should have been the ones making the movie. The trailers feigned the promise of solid entertainment, but in the words of Winston Churchill those promotional people knew \"this was their finest two minutes.\" The skilled actors chosen even made AAMPAS think in terms of awards but clever resemblances, mannerisms, speech patterns, and makeup do not a good story make. Unknowns with a good story have a better chance. This is what you get when a Mutual Admiration Society gets some money and a green light.",

A text appearing at the starts says that Dick Cheney is a very secretive man and portraying events which happened behind closed doors is very difficult, even impossible. Then, as if pleading exemption of this difficult task the words at least we peep tried pops up. Albeit it did put a smile on my face, it still doesn't excuse for the fact that a great portion of the events of the first half of the film have already blended into a rather fuzzy mix in my memory.The beginning of the film attempts to tell what kind of a man Cheney is and how got involved in politics. It isn't a straightforward kind of narrative where the events of one scene fluently leads to another. Rather, it jumps from one moment in time to another, lingering in some moments for only a few seconds. There's a lot of name dropping during first half and a lot of events are dealt with in just one sentence. Such moments as Cheney becoming the CEO of Halliburton, he being the White House Chief of Staff or the Secretary of Defense rather only mentioned. The films true focus is on the time when Cheney ran as W. Bush's VP and how he steered power in his direction.The whole structure of the film is like an investigative article. The director Adam Mckay might have taken one or two pointers from Michael Lewis, the author of the Big Short, which Mckay adapted into a film. Vice also contains the same satiric tone. There's once again a narrator to emphasize how outrageous some of the things happening on the screen are. Fourth wall is broken often, which this time around isn't as sharp and witty as it was in The Big Short. There are however some funny deliberate satiric imaginations of the gaps where we don't exactly know what was said since there are no eye witness accounts, my favourites being the moments where Cheney and his wife recite Shakespeare in bed as they discuss him running as VP and where a waiter explains how Guantanamo Bay operates as if it's the evenings menu.But ultimately Vice is entirely Christian Bale's show. His the center of almost every scene and his transformation into Dick Cheney truly is Oscar worthy. Steve Carell and Sam Rockwell do fantastic job as well, but they're not given nearly as much as space as Bale is. The film as whole just doesn't feel as coherent narrative as The Big Short did. However, Mckay has the same sort of satiric touch as Michael Lewis has to dig up moments in history and present them in such outrageous way that it's almost hard to believe they actually happened, and perhaps make us wonder wonder why we didn't notice this back in the day.",

For example, Jesse Plemons babbles on about how Chaney told his family that he was ready to die, but somehow finds him at fault for accepting an unexpected heart transplant. Are we really supposed to fault a person and make him out to be evil for accepting an 11th hour heart transplant when he was expecting to die, just because he said he was ready to die?Or the statement that since that time Halliburton's stock has increased by 500% since then (17 years?). By itself, that might sound impressive, but I'm curious to know how that compares to the performance of the stock market in general. For example a comparison to the Dow or against peers within it's industry would have provided more meaning either clearly demonstrating a cause and effect, or just business as usual. I don't know what the answer is, but the way it was presented leaves me skeptical. Or what about the endless criticism of the creation of the right leaning Fox Network without any acknowledgement of the existence of left leaning news outlets? It's fine if you chose to dislike Fox, but to portray them as the only network with a bias, clearly shows a bias. And lastly, one of the few times they make Chaney out be be a decent human being by having him adamantly standing by his gay daughter, they undo it at the end by blaming him for his other daughter coming out publicly against gay marriage in order to win her election instead of blaming the daughter.Basically, by the films inability to attempt to portray a balanced presentation and choosing to take every opportunity to hit on the liberal hot button items as opposed to concentrating on the core issues of the mess that was created in the Middle East, it loses much credibility and so, we get another example of preaching to the choir rather than trying to connect with everyone in the audience.",

Bush made campaign promises to combat climate-change -through the regulation of carbon emissions- that Cheney not only ignored but flipped on it's head. It was highly disturbing to see Cheney and the fossil fuel interests he represented. We now understand that the Iraqi war had far more to do with American fossil fuel interests and their desired access to Iraqi oil fields than the presumed battle against terrorism used to motivate the Iraqi invasion ...Well said and examined by Michael Mann in his Vice article and book about this president/VP.",

And Christian didn't disappoint, his acting was great and the makeup team did a great work on him showing his aging. Other actors didn't get such a good makeup done, for example Steve Carell played Donald Rumsfeld who is older than Chaney, but by the end of the movie he looked much younger. Amy Adams was great as always.I still don't understand what was the point of this movie. Usually when a movie is not enjoyable I wait till the end to see what's the point. I guess I never learn, because there's usually no point, and this movie wasn't an exception. The worst part: you know how in some movies 15 minutes before the end they MUST play dramatic music while showing you 3 scenes at the same time, trying to trick you into thinking that this movie \"connected the dots\" for you and now you realize something you didn't know before? Well, here they did it with totally unrelated plot lines which the viewer already knew how they end, and they were all boring, so it was really weird watching. It was a total waste of time like 90% of this movie and the only thing I could think of, was why am I so bad at choosing movies.Even the election campaign part was full of short punchlines and totally devoid of anything that can help you understand how campaigns really look like, which is kind of important if you're making a political drama.But I don't even know what was this movie supposed to be. Is it a documentary? It wasn't very informative and very long. Is it a comedy? It had some funny parts but no. Is it an action thriller? There were actually quite a few stunts and jump scares, totally uncalled for. The movie felt like they took a recipe to a Hollywood blockbuster and tried to make a political satire with the same ingredients. If you try to make a healthy meal using only ingredients found in a cake, you'll fail miserably. Go read the Wikipedia page about Chaney and save yourself 2 hours.",

Bush. We see the events that occurred leading up to his vice presidency, and the intense motivation his wife, Lynne Cheney (played by Amy Adams), gave him.Christian Bale and Amy Adams are easily the two best things about this film. The way they transformed into their characters made the performances so believable. Bale being the quiet and intimidating politician, and Adams being his main supporter the entire time. It digs a little into their personal lives as well. Bale put on a ton of weight for this film and that shows his dedication to the role. There are some other notable performances from actors such as Steve Carell, Sam Rockwell, and Tyler Perry. The casting for this film couldn't have been better.Though the actors did excellent, it is not a flawless movie by any means. There are some questionable decisions as far as editing goes. The film tends to spell things out a bit too much, and I wish the director would have had a little more faith in the audience. This film is not in favor of Dick Cheney for obvious reasons. Him, and others in the White House, are depicted as immoral and downright evil; responsible for the deaths of hundreds of thousands of innocent people. The story is meant to be brutally honest, but can easily come off as biased. This isn't a movie for anyone who is a supporter of Cheney. It's so far left even leftists might cringe at some of the narrative. What else would you expect from Hollywood?Overall, I enjoyed the film. Fantastic acting, some really funny moments, some really surprising moments, and good direction. It's a well done depiction of how power can go to one man's head, and how he can then change the whole world. I would recommend it to anyone interested in how he gained such power.",

One regret, and this is no one's fault, but the medium, there is no way to demonstrate the true development of the character over time. What crucibles formed him? How deep and crushing were those? How did he deal? How did he react? How much time did it take to recover? To remake the man he became? Has become? It was implied in the film how quickly Cheney was able to throw under the bus, by turning on a dime, those he had a long relationship with. This is not always preventable, but the film did show perhaps Cheney had a talent for it. The film was a drama/comedy, which was a refreshing and entertaining experience to the well worn and too predictable \"this is how a movie goes\". George Bush character is good for a chuckle. Steve Carrell is an entertaining \"Rrrrrrrrrrumsfeld!!!!!\" I wish they has shown the \"snowflakes\", memos, Rrrrrrrrrrumsfeld is still infamous for today.

            "content": "Vice, this year's winner of the Best Makeup award in the Oscars is perhaps the movie that divided people the most among the Best Picture nominees. You can argue Bohemian Rhapsody also received mixed reviews but that movie was at least well received by audiences. However Vice's tomatometer currently sits at 66% and the audience score is 58%. This is a movie that can be defined either good or bad really depending on your political spectrum. All politics aside I was pretty sure I was going to like this movie since I am a big fan of the political genre of movies. Since this is a very political genre I was expecting this movie like any other political films to address a ugly truth of our government in a compelling way. So did I get what I expected from the genre? Let's talk about it.Unlike other reviews I will start off with the negatives. For me half of the movie was such a waste of time. From the intro to when Dick Cheney is sworn into vice presidency serves no purpose and is just a messily edited political lecture garbage. It does nothing to develop Dick Cheney's character or anything that comes later in the other 1/2 of the movie. All it does is mock Republican administrations and portray democratic presidents in a messianic manner. Throughout the movie Vice cannot quite being a American Leftist propaganda. Even in the other 1/2 of the movie this movie continues to bash Republican policies and keeps on lecturing us Democratic policies like how tax cuts are bad and how we should protect the environment. Also as I mentioned before this movie is very poorly edited throughout especially in the first half of the movie. It is told non linear in some parts for some reasons and has random flashbacks for no reasons whatsoever. The movie pauses when introducing characters in a very distracting manner. I was very surprised to see this was nominated for Best editing in the Oscars. Also the most unforgivable aspect of the film is it's portrayal of Saddam Hussein. Yes, I am against the Iraq invasion but the way they portray Hussein as a innocent sacrificial lamb is just plain unforgivable. He is a dictator who killed millions of his people, but all of that is ignored. This probably is the biggest negative I have on this movie.Fortunately this is a movie that gets better as it gets going. After the first half of the movie the movie gets gradually better and as soon as the plane hits the world trade center in 9/11 I thought it was very good. The movie becomes very focused and has less distracting editing and political lecturing. The movie ends in a excellent way leaving us with a compelling message on abuse of power and a pretty clever twist. It would be close to blasphemous if you don't mention Christian Bale when talking about Vice. He did a legitimately amazing job as Dick Cheney and the supporting cast from Steve Carrel, Amy Adams, Sam Rockwell, Tyler Perry deliver fantastic performances that make even the bad first half of the movie watchable. This personally to me is the best acted movie of this year. I think I liked Christian Bale's performance over Rami Malek, but he did a great job so why not.Overall this is a movie that is very messily edited and has very unnecessary moments. The first 1/2 you can really skip and through out the run time this film can't quite being a American leftist propaganda. But just the performances are worth watching and the ending is excellent. I still did get what I wanted from the genre in the compelling message in the end. All that ends well is good. This is a 6/10 and though I have very mixed feelings this still is a thumbs up and a positive review.",

It is my humble opinion that Christian Bale deserves the Oscar for this role. They might give it to Rami Malek for playing Freddie Mercury but I sincerely believe that Bale should get it this time. I mean just look at his body (no pun intended) of work and compare it to this role. Regardless of how similar he looks to the real Dick Cheney, just watch movies like American Psycho (2000), The Machinist (2004), The Prestige (2006), Nolan's Batman Trilogy (2005-2012), The Fighter (2010), American Hustle (2013) and Adam McKay's The Big Short (2015). He's never the same character. I've seen actors like Robert De Niro, Jared Leto, Marlon Brando, Charlize Theron, Jake Gyllenhaal, Matthew McConaughey and more gain and lose weights for roles but I've never seen anyone do it as much as Bale. It's literally insane and unhealthy but somehow he constantly pulls it off. Just give him the bloody statue already for God's sake!\nAmy Adams is terrific as usual and her chemistry with Christian Bale is always amazing. It's like they were born for each other on screen. I've never EVER seen Sam Rockwell deliver a bad performance. He's still incredibly underrated as an actor in my opinion and I will never understand why. He always delivers and this performance is certainly no exception. I also think that Steve Carell did a tremendous job with his role. Could have just as well received an Oscar nomination for his role like Bale, Adams and Rockwell.To state the obvious, YES the movie is a bit too politically charged, but what do you expect from a movie about the former Vice President of the United States?\nHowever I feel as if the audience should be able to set the political agenda aside and just simply enjoy the film for what it is. A critique on human behavior. I love how Adam McKay challenges the viewers and audience to think for themselves and use their brain and critical thinking. He constantly criticizes the group behavior and encourages individualism and that's what I love about him as a director. After all, it is the individual who suffers and not the group.\nUs humans are not as smart as we like to think we are and Adam McKay is truly great at reminding us of this simple yet easily forgettable fact and I salute him for it.\nOverall an entertaining, thought provoking and funny film with great performances from the cast and a witty, intelligent script.\n8/10.",

            "content": "\"Appear weak when you are strong. Appear strong when you are weak\" (Sun Tzu).Although Dick Cheney was born nearly 2500 after Sun Tzu, he brought new life to the art of war. In this movie, Adam MacKay's disembowelment of the unstoppable bowling ball's rise to power is a thrill and is laced with humour to make Cheney's climb to power even more absurd. Yes, of course Christian Bale is great. The little intricacies of Cheney's mannerisms and gravelly, scattergun voice are down to a tee. Cheney is not made to be the pantomime villain he might have been. He loves his family and that is made clear. To an extent. Amy Adams' Lynne Cheney grows beautifully from suffereing wife to a Claire Underwood. Sam Rockwell's George W. Bush is a hapless fool that resembles Bale's Cheney's steak on a plate that he slowly takes apart. Steve Carrell is excellent as the boisterous and incredulous Donald Rumsfeld. Just like how he was in \"The Big Short\". The plot trundles along like Cheney walking down a corridor and it contains many chaotic cut scenes. Just like The Big Short\". I could go on. Maybe this is just MacKay's style but I found it mirrored The Big Short\" a bit too much. That being said, there are moments that pull on the heart strings. Cheney's recognition of his mortality is poignant. The horrors of The War on Terror are examined and leave a bad taste in your mouth. The shared didcomfort of Dubya and an Iraqi father are compelling.In all, an excellent movie it nearly was. Leaving the brilliant performances to make this movie stand on its on two feet would have been the best medicine. The style of the movie seems transplanted from \"The Big Short\" which could do with plastic surgery.",

It was extra heartbreaking for me because I bought in to this after getting an impression of fun film from the trailer. I would say Adam McKay used exactly what he showed us, a fish hook. Would I have watched it if it was dark, probably not. Even when 1 hour in, the movie was still fun. Then it started pouring out visely about the Vice who was not at all vise.It is heartbreaking to see that people can't see through what they are choosing for.

Speaking of, the sets for the film were spectacular and filled with a 10 star method acting Christian Bale, fantastic performances from Steve Carell, Amy Adams and Sam Rockwell. I'm still not sure how to see the jarring style of the film, with the intro, pace and mid-ending. I did however, absolutely love the narration and the reasoning for the man narrating. Rather than it being showed to the audience directly, it was revealed in the most shocking part of the narrative which brought the ascending pace to a halt for just a moment. That scene was specifically effective in conveying a negative image of Cheney (I had no prior knowledge of his career - which overall made the message of the film more effective) but even once given such a negative opinion on him, the ending, address to camera still had an impact. The entire experience of the film- which I would consider a masterpiece in today's climate was thrilling.",

So many people are biased by their political views when watching this movie. The political discussion is served, but no one should make the mistake of taking this movie as a stream of sheer verified facts. On my side after watching it, I could only ask myself, is this the real Cheney? Was he so apathic? To what extent did he really hold the reins of power? If he was like this, why was he so? Would he be clinically diagnosed as a sociopath? a psycopath?To all of this, Dick Cheney might claim to be the first vicepresident to be featured in a Hollywood movie as the main character, and here lies the contradiction, by exposing some already known-facts of Cheney's dark upper hand in US politics during the Bush Administration, the movie sometimes inadvertently helps build the image of an obscure, albeit grand Cheney, that the real person in life might even find pleasing. We don't know whether Cheney sleeps with a sentiment of remorse at night but it's difficult to imagine him uneased when viewing this film. But everything can happen, who knows.

(really, the event of Cheney shooting a friend in the face is maybe one minute of screen time. Why? If you're not going to go in depth, cut it.).\nThe biggest concern I have with the movie is its celebration of blandness. Given that Cheney is a mediocrity that rose to power, and his circle is much the same. So there is no need for histrionics. Think \"Rain Man\" without Dustin Hoffman's overacting.\nChristian Bale does the job, but I still believe everyone's focus will be on the makeup. Same as Gary Oldman as Churchill in \"Darkest Hour.\"\nI'm a huge fan of Amy Adams, but not here. Empty character, rote acting.\nSam Rockwell as George W.

The Cheney story is an interesting one, and giving it full force would make a lasting work of art. This is something frivolous.Perhaps the most annoying example was a lengthy scene in which Dick and his wife speak in mock-Shakespearean language. Any competent editor would have cut this without a moment's hesitation. But then a competent editor would have cut many of what appear to be attempts at artistic flair. The director lacked the needed skills.So the rating on this film is inflated -- something between 5 and 6 would have been achieved if those leaning to the left were able to refrain from upgrading the film for being laudably anti-right.",

It is certainly not the issue of this discussion.The Vice is a biopic on Dick Cheney, one of the most powerful and influential politicians in the modern American history. Christian Bale is amazing in the leading role.The movie opens with a scene where Dick Cheney, as vice president in the government of George W. Bush, along with other officials manage the September 11 attacks. Then the film flashes back and follows Dick Cheney's route from failure to the White House.A narrator - we find out about who he is at the end of the movie with a rather repulsive way - quides us explaining and commenting on the events; not with great success, in my opinion.The film talks about too many events. By doing so it doesn't focus on any of them. It looks like a big list referring to events we can easily find about at the internet. There is no space to go in depth disclosing issues and views behind the facts. Neither it manages to reach the essence of who that man is. Saying way too much but saying nothing really.

Although marketed as a comedy for some reason, both of the leads play this movie straight faced with very little wit to persuade an audience this movie really is a comedy. Where most of the trouble seemed to be was editing as well. Unfortunately whoever edited this movie will probably receive accolades due to its \"non linear\" timeline, but seriously this movie is one of the most poorly edited movies of the year. Unlike \"The Big Short,\" \"Vice\" does not accomplish the fourth wall break edits which is what lifted the tone of the former film as well as its cinematography which is abysmal as this film trudges on. The only person who seems to have been told this movie is Steve Carrell who turns in another solid performance. Unfortunately the academy will recognize the two leads and possibly Rockwell who turns in a performance that is what the tone of the movie SHOULD have been. Nomination wise this movie really should have fallen off the face of the earth. There was a better political movie this year with a better lead performance (\"Chappaquiddick\" and Jason Clarke). If you're looking for a movie to go see I would avoid this one. Watch the trailer and read a summary of Dick Cheney and you'll get the same feeling that you would if you actually view this movie. There's a big reason I gave it a 4 and honestly it could go lower, but as of right now I'll leave it there. Very disappointed in this movie as I had been intrigued by its Oscar buzz. The Academy will recognize it due to their liberal ties, but I would suggest they look into some movies that were actually good this year and should be recognized more (Leave No Trace, Annihilation, Hereditary).",

'Vice' contains excellent performances (some of the best of the year) from Christian Bale, Amy Adams and Sam Rockwell, with exceptional hair and makeup to aid those performances. The movie is very enjoyable and fast-paced, due to a good script and interesting plot. Where the movie lacks is its structure and editing. The movie's timeline is very jumpy, occasionally skipping ten years of Cheney's life, with little to no description of what happened during those years. The movie also cannot decide whether it is a linear or non-linear movie, as it will jump back and forth to a couple plot points occasionally, but it does not do that with all plot points. The editing of the movie is also very strange, as it is too modern for its subject matter. The movie is edited so that it freezes on certain images containing people's faces, and then does an angled zoom on the face. The movie also slots in random bits of real-life footage to reflect what is happening in the movie. There are also a few surreal/dream-like sequences in the movie. These three choices do not suit the first two acts of the movie, as they are set from 1960-2000, and they also do not generally suit Cheney's story, as he is elderly for the majority of this movie, and this editing style is modern. 'Vice' is also lacking in the depth of an exploration of Cheney's political beliefs, as it appears that he joined the Republican Party as he liked Rumsfeld, but the movie does not actually go into depth about Cheney's deeper political beliefs (or his lack there of) for the rest of the movie.

I don't even get why Bale's performance keeps getting praised?

This is another fiction unsupported by facts.As political drama, it was nothing more than a cartoon. Delivered in a choppy format, the actors tell you what each is thinking.

Frenetic editing, odd narrator choice, and true lack of information on what Cheney actually did hurts the film tremendously. The movie just takes instances that were publicly known and makes a film of it. Also liberties were taken with the portrayal of both G W Bush & Rumsfeld, making characters of themselves that would be better suited for a satire and not the film presented.Overall Cheney was presented very one note...not very complex and no real methods were presented in why his decisions were made. The movie doesn't completely make him out to be the ultimate villain, as they did show his endearing love to his family, but not trying to dig more into his reasons or motivations, will leave you wishing more research was done.The editing of the film was truly the biggest disappointment, as it reminded me of Oliver Stone's Natural Born Killers or JFK, except where it worked in creating an atmosphere in both those films, here it distracts the viewer because it is pointless and has no bearing on the plot. It's truly a jumbled mess and amateurish at best.The recent nominations for Bale and Adams are deserved...Rockwell was good too, but his performance just didn't fit the tone of the film.In my opinion, it seems that the filmmaker originally wanted to present a satire mixed with drama, much like his earlier film The Big Short...However the execution did not live up to the expectation and the film falls flat because of it.",

Any film that inspires it's audience to think is a good thing. Christian Bale's performance was impressive, managing to display Cheney's mannerisms and undergoing the change of his physical appearance. Along with Amy Adams, Tyler Perry and Sam Rockwell who also gave solid acting performances. Vice does a good job of putting the darkest sides of politics on display and providing the audience with understandable analogies. It exposed at least a few events surrounding the attacks of 9/11 but obviously holds back on certain events. Facts that were either chosen not to be included in the film or were not allowed to be shared. Either way it paints a corrupt but honest picture on how politics in the real world work. The makeup artist department did exceptional well, especially with not only Bale's character but Rockwell's as well.The Bad: The forced comedic tone on the director's behalf strips this film of the opportunity to become a serious dramatic biopic. More so on the directory and screenplay flaws was the choppy scene structure. A continuing problem that starts in the very first shot of the movie. Jumping back and forth between different time periods in Cheney's life, often without purpose to the plot. (Spoiler ahead) Bringing me to Plemons's character who serves as narrator and turns out to be Cheney's heart donator. An idea that only serves the plot in a comedic way. (Spoiler over) Going down the path of a comedy which was a mistake to begin with. In a film that feels like it wants to taken serious, while in the next shot it's shooting jokes that just don't stick to the situations.Conclusion: What barely earns this film a 7/10 is the acting done by Bale, Adams and the subject matter that the filmmakers chose to tackle. Jumping through the hoops to acquire the information needed to conduct this film couldn't have been easy. Not a film I plan to rewatch but definitely a film I'm glad I've watched at least once.",

The screenplay is decent, the story is quite interesting, but some of the creative decisions are bad.

Steve Carrell terrific as Rumsfeld.  I loved looking at Washington DC politics, from Nixon to Bush 43 and beyond; albeit through a specific lens.   While this is clearly not pro-Cheney I do appreciate the view of him as a family man and his predominant protection of his daughter on LGBTQIA issues.   The Direction and Cinematography are great.

Trump did not fall out of the sky, he rose from the ashes of the Cheney administration. The ground work was well laid in the form of alternative facts, subversion of law and order and unilateral decision making. The concept of the all powerful, unassailable unitary executive is now the modus operandi of many an aspiring dictator all over the world, the age of democracy is ending. I lived through those precedent shattering days and well remember the internal fear. \nMore insidious is the results of the lies - a destabilized middle east and the resulting geopolitical aftershocks reverberating in Yemen and Ukraine; a collapsing climate with a brutal outlook for most of humanity; a demolished series of walls between executive, judiciary and legislative leading to utter injustice and chaos. \nThis ongoing century of American decline can be traced back to Vice and its depicted decisions, setting the course of the world for a new era.",

Vice does come off as a very one-sided argument though, which I can see many people posing it at a propaganda film, but the events are not portrayed in a manner unfair to Dick Cheney.

With \u2018Vice', McKay does the same thing tone-wise that he did with \u2018The Big Short': apply an unusually light tone to a period in history that was anything but; whilst that worked with the latter film, it doesn't always work here. \u2018Vice' seems to be more focused on entertaining than anything else and, as such, ends up being a rather superficial look at a period in US history that significantly changed the way the Western world works (for the worse) and the man who, arguably and according to this film, was behind it all. Sure, it's pretty entertaining with a few flashes of brilliance, but despite that, you can't help but feel that it's a bit too serious of a topic and the negative effects too lasting not to have dug a bit deeper.",

Christian bale deserves an Oscar for this role. I've never seen him so different before , maybe Batman but man he was phenomenal in this movie. Another stand out is Steve carrel.

Some of the parallels to the Trump administration are a bit too on-the-nose, but far from inaccurate. Bale's performance was solid and clearly was the result of considerable dedication, though it descends into overacting at points; despite the periodic criticism that he receives each time he dives into method acting to take his body to some physical extreme, the critical approval never seems to be far behind.

One would be wrong.  The writing is atrocious, the editing is clunky and, by the time the end credits begin to roll, it feels like a movie with an identity crisis.  Listed as a biography, a drama and a comedy, \"Vice\" never really seems to find any foothold in any one of those genres.  If anything, the movie feels like a liberally-slanted satirical biography that tries too hard to dramatic and funny.  The drama is underwhelming, and the comedy feels forced.\n\nThe lilies among the thorns, though, are the brilliant performances of Bale (Dick Cheney), Carell (Donald Rumsfeld) and Rockwell (George W. Bush).  Not unexpectedly, these three truly captured the spirits of the roles they portrayed, with Bale turning in an astounding performance that tops all his previous efforts.  Were it not for the awful editing of the film, Bale's performance could easily make you forget that he's NOT Dick Cheney.  The physical and vocal transformation into the much more public Cheney that we're used to seeing is spot-on, and reminds us, once again, of Bale's acting excellence.\n\nUltimately, though, the cast just can't save the film from itself, making it fall well short of my all-time \"Must See Again!\" movie list.",

            "content": "\"I will not apologize for keeping this country safe\" is a line the Dick Cheney character says near the end of Adam McKay's new movie Vice. According to the film this phrase is how Richard Bruce Cheney justified his actions throughout his career in Washington. Now I am not here to talk about his politics or how his actions affected America. I am just here to judge this as a stand alone piece of work.\n\nAs I said earlier Vice is Directed by one of my all time favorite directors in Adam McKay. If you are unfamiliar he is a former SNL writer has directed Anchorman, Talladega Nights, Step Brothers, The Other Guys and The Big Short before this. The Big Short is the one we are going to focus on though, because it seems McKay starting honing his new style during that film. His style is so different and interesting because it involves a ton of cutting back and forth between scenes; however it also involves him creating scenarios where narrators explain complex ideas in Layman's terms. The latter made the Big Short and Vice much easier to follow for people who may not follow the financial and political worlds in depth. He brings that style to Vice in very effective ways and it makes the movie very enjoyable to follow.\n\nEven though he is such a private guy (as the movie jokingly points out) we get to see a good mix of Cheney's early life in Wyoming and then his later political life in Washington DC. He is portrayed as a master maneuverer and someone who knew how to find power in any way possible. I will say there are times the movie drags and a couple cuts that just feel unnecessary.\n\nStarring in this is one of the All Timers in Christian Bale. He is probably the best actor in the world right now since Daniel Day Lewis says he's retired. Bale transforms into Cheney unlike anything I have seen since the aforementioned Day Lewis became Lincoln. He looks like him, talks like him, and just makes you believe everything he did on screen Cheney did in real life. Bale is so damn good in this movie he is absolutely in the Pantheon of greatest actors in History and is my front runner for this years Oscar.\n\nHis partner in crime (take this one of two ways) in the movie is Donald Rumsfeld played by Steve Carell (in a much different role than Welcome to Marwen). He gets to basically act like an ass all movie while portraying a man who surprisingly kept positions of power for a long time. There is an interesting dichotomy of apprentice and master with him and Cheney throughout the movie that is fun to watch. Of course Sam Rockwell is great playing an especially goofy George W. Bush, he gets to put on a southern accent and smile at Christian Bale's grimace.\n\nThe last performance to highlight is the always great Amy Adams. Every time she is in a something she just brings it, one of the more reliable actors out there. She has a good mix of understanding and intensity this movie that would be hard to match for any other actress (god damn I sound like an asshole).\n\n*A Couple other Tidbits:\n\n- Tyler Perry (A long way from Madea movies) give some stirring work in only a few scenes as Colin Powell.\n\n- Watching Cheney turn on his daughter was heart wrenching (not a spoiler it happened in real life).\n\n- A Condoleezza Rice character gets a line or two in this, thats fun.\n\nThere will of course be people upset with how the Republican party is portrayed throughout the movie. If people can separate themselves from that and just enjoy, they might find this is one of this years gems. I really hope McKay continues to make movies like this.\n\nJuice Rating:\n84/100",

A 130 minute film about the 2008 housing crisis should have been a snooze fest, but thanks to great performances, a ballsy, energetic script and a directorial style that seemed to make up the rules as it went along, it was electric. So I had high hopes for this, a 130 minute film about George W. Bush's monotone vice president. And I wonder whether it was those high hopes that scuppered my enjoyment a little. It's a good film, with good performances, anchored by a fantastic performance by Christian Bale (he's very often very good isn't he?). But the same energetic, scattershot approach as The Big Short somehow fails to elicit the same enjoyment. Maybe it's because it doesn't have the surprise factor? Maybe it's because it doesn't have the benefit of multiple story strands? Whatever the reason, there's only flashes of brilliance in an otherwise rote story. The narrator played too big a role for me, which took me away from the proceedings. Apparently there were other scenes (including a musical number) that Adam McKay took out of the film to give it a more serious tone. I don't really understand the thinking behind that. It's already a film that does some crazy things, so why not shoot for the moon, like your previous film did, and go all out? Use the absurdity of your approach to make serious points about serious things. There's plenty of straightforward films out there already.",

But overall it's just watchable. The movie just feels a little hollow, probably because there wasn't a central theme running throughout the movie. The best part about the movie is definitely the performances, Christian Bale, Amy Adams and Sam Rockwell give off really great performances along with Steve Carell doing an alright job. Overall, Vice passes the time and it has some memorable performances and plot elements, but it's not enough to be great.",

For any of those who only heard about this movie thanks to the Oscars, just know that everything that was said about this movie was a complete lie. For example, many times during the ceremony, announcers claimed that Vice shreaded the usual structure of biopics. This is true for the last half of the movie. The first half is hardly structured in a unique way. The second half of the movie, though, is. However, you'll have wished that it wasn't because it completely goes off the rails. First things first, the movie does this weird thing where rather than looking at big things during the Bush presidency and how Cheney was involved-- what was literally advertised in all the trailers and marketing--the movie instead decides to have Christian Bale make a dick joke and then montage through Enron, most of the Middle East, etc. There are only three things looked at: the concept of the Unitary Executive, 9/11, and the Invasion of Iraq. The movie then sloppily transitions to Cheney's life after the Bush Presidency. He ditches his lesbian daughter to help his other daughter win a local election and then does an interview where he oddly breaks the fourth wall and tells the audience that he did everything he did because he's the only one willing to do what's necessary. At this point of the movie, I realized that the movie's greatest problem was that it lacked any message. The last ten minutes convey the idea that Cheney was willing to do whatever it took to win and to keep Americans safe. However, those same ideas don't show up anywhere else in the movie. Christian Bale and Amy Adams give good performances, but it's just not enough to save this mess. Easily the most disappointing movie of 2018. \n\n3/10",

The direction by Adam McVay was really good, using a lot of visual similes and metaphores and the editing put them all togheter with perfect timing, making some of them highly momorable. Unfortunately it's not all perfect. In fact the biggest problem was the missing sense of the movie, not because is something cerebral but because it raises a question: \"what was the point of doing this film?\". I'm not from the US so I'm not into the American politics and its propaganda, which I felt was the main aspect of the movie. Because otherwise is a film about the cruelty of human beings, in particular of Dick Cheney, but if the message wanted to be this one there could be other numerous better subjects to base a film on. In conclusion I liked the film, and particular its direction that was unique but at the end of the day it gave me nothing, except for the fact that Dick Cheney was a very ruthless man.",

            "content": "This will surely go down as one of the strangest Best Picture nominees of all time as it didn't receive a positive critical reception, deservedly, but I suppose liberal politics mean more to Hollywood than the quality of the film itself. With talent like Jesse Plemons and Amy Adams on-screen I was hoping for some great acting and although I'm not a fan of this new phase of Adam McKay's career I was hoping for some interesting political commentary. It's approach is definitely better than most films about controversial politicians like The Iron Lady (2011) which chooses to neither praise nor criticize Margaret Thatcher for the political decisions she made. Vice is most definitely an attack on Dick Cheney and that point of view allows for a decent argument to be structured and clear characters to be molded and displayed to an audience who may or may not agree with the message of the film.\n\nMcKay employs the same winking at the camera style used in The Big Short (2015) with almost every character breaking the fourth wall, celebrity cameos, sardonic voiceover, a fake ending and an entire scene delivered in iambic pentameter. His subject is Dick Cheney, Christian Bale, who he views as an evil, power-hungry politician who is responsible for most of the political turmoil in the United States during the 21st Century. Along for the ride are hapless politician George W. Bush, Sam Rockwell, his Lady Macbeth-esque wife Lynne, Amy Adams and the mentor that he eventually succeeds Donald Rumsfeld, Steve Carell. Voiceover is heard throughout the film from Kurt, Jesse Plemons, who has his real identity revealed in a particularly irritating scene.\n\nI mentioned my only praise of the film in the opening paragraph because beyond it's clear political intentions there is nothing of merit in this film. It's utterly smug in the way it delivers it's various \u00e2~jokes' but unfortunately none of them are particularly funny. Even the breaking the fourth wall moments didn't feel playful or special it just seemed like McKay was far too impressed with his own abilities as a filmmaker. It was almost like watching a Jean-Luc Godard film where it's impossible to divorce what little substance the film has with the pretension of it's director. As previously mentioned I am usually really impressed by any performance that Adams gives from Enchanted (2007) to Nocturnal Animals (2016) but here she was just sort of meh. If I wanted a great Lady Macbeth I would watch Erszebet Kutvolgyi and don't get me started on the Shakespearean scene.\n\nThe film is very, very obvious in that the word \"Power\" is said in an extremely serious tone by nearly every character in the film in every scene and the film's uncomplicated thesis is summed up within the first ten minutes of the film. Dick Cheney wants power at all costs because\u00e2\u00a6.he wants power. Yes he was a drunk disappointment and we are lead to believe that he wanted power in any form but all of the reasonings are either clich\u00c3 (C) or nonsensical. A film like Secret Honor (1984) actually spends time pondering why Richard Nixon had such a voracious appetite for power and his backstory and outside influences on him are delved into fully. Vice avoids any nuance and all elements of Cheney's personal life are dealt with gracelessly as his difficult relationship with his homosexual daughter Mary, Alison Pill, is exploited.\n\nIf you are a liberal angry at your fellow Americans for having elected politicians like Dick Cheney and Donald Trump this film will be able to get you fired up and angry at what you may see as an unjust political situation. Personally, I felt isolated at times because I don't feel any burning rage at Cheney being a non-American and the fact that the film often got caught on what felt like personal grievance removed a certain shine from it. The waste of talent is staggering and I hope that Adams and Bale can team up again in a film as entertaining and funny as American Hustle (2013). Hopefully the Academy can let go of Adam McKay because if he produces another film this middling and unfortunately poorly made it would be ridiculous to nominate it for Best Picture.",

He nails all the little ticks and mannerisms of Cheney in each scene. The acting across the board is strong. Amy Adams (Lynne Vincent Cheney) might be at her best alongside Bale in her career (American Hustle, The Fighter) and that was the case again here. Sam Rockwell (George W. Bush) is a show stealer in a limited role as the former President. Steve Carell (Donald Rumsfeld) is also great. Obviously, the makeup effects in this are fantastic. There's a reason that department was Oscar nominated. The film is mostly well written, with interesting scenes and sharp dialogue among the characters. It gives a very interesting look in how one man rose through the ranks of the political world and how much influence Cheney had on a lot of things.\n\nWeaknesses: Adam McKay often beats us over the head with the message of the movie. There are times when he tries too hard to showcase something, as if he doesn't trust his audience's ability to understand it all. Often, there are parts of the story that feel kind of dull. That causes some pacing issues and the two hour runtime ends up feeling closer to 2.5 hours. \n\nOverall: I can see this being polarizing. While I'm not as invested in the political agenda, I found this to be an entertaining film that deserves a ton of praise for the work of its actors.",

Vice is a decent biographical comedy drama film which follows Vice President Dick Cheney (Christian Bale) from his earlier years in 1969 when he dropped out of Yale from alcoholism to interning during the Nixon Administration. Working his way up in the office from Secretary of Defense to being a Vice President in the 2000 Presidential election. This film may not be for everyone. I am not into politics. Adam McKay\u2019s direction on handling this biographical film about Dick Cheney does feel quite uneven. Yes, he is trying to adapt the story onto the big screen while keeping fresh and have some comical moments of trying to light up the mood. Which it works, I did enjoy some parts of the film. It does leave the movie feeling a little odd in the end. The film is narrated by Kurt (Jesse Plemons) who is a normal American civilian which has an impact and connection when it comes to the climax of the film. The movie does break the fourth wall barrier to explain to the audience about the whole situation with Dick Cheney. If it is good or bad information being given, all comes down to how the individual audience would take it. Christian Bale did great as Dick Cheney. His physical performance of gaining weight for the role and changing his hair appearance. His acting was great. Amy Adams was also good playing Lynne Cheney. Steve Carrell was also good as Donald Rumsfield. Sam Rockwell playing George W. Bush was also good. Adam McKay does a great job in handling a film with a serious topic that can easily create a controversy. He tries to make it understandable for audience who are into politics or not. I still enjoyed his other drama film The Big Short more. Overall, Vice is a fair film. The performances are great. Adam McKay\u2019s direction did seem a little off balance with trying to be funny in a serious topic. ",

Illegitimate-son-as-organ-donor would have been plausible, but the implication was never addressed again in the movie, nor was it substantiated.  A human heart donor for Cheney was explicitly shown, despite fact that Cheney received an artificial heart.\n\nThe scenes depicting 9/11 fail to address Norman Mineta's testimony to Congress concerning Cheney ordering an Airman not to deviate from orders not to intercept a missile heading toward the Pentagon.\n\nScenes depicting Cheney as a drunk are highly derivative and mostly untrue.  The creators of the movie, \"W.\" could not have done a better job of cloning their own movie.\n\nToward the end of the movie, there is some sort of absurd implication that everything bad that ever happened in the world, even after the end of the Bush administration, somehow stemmed from Cheney's Vice Presidency, from wildfires to the opioid crisis.\n\nThe transposition of news coverage and commercial advertising from the 9/11 era added a splendid dynamic, a dark sort of nostalgia.  This was perhaps the greatest... and only... triumph of Vice.  Charitably a 3/10 for effort, taken down to a 1.5/10 because of the jab at Trump supporters in the post-credit scene.\n\nIt begs the question: If Cheney is the ultimate evil in the world, what is the need to associate him with Trump?  And if vice versa, then why make a movie about Cheney when Cheney has already been covered in other movies such as, \"W?\"  Why not make a Trump movie instead?\n\nThose involved with the making of this movie seek to draw a neat line connecting Nixon, Cheney, and Trump, despite the fact that there is none.  To suggest otherwise is pure sophistry.  If the problems of the world were so easy to divine, they would have been solved once and for all long ago.\n\nVice is by its own admission partisan, and it is the height of arrogance to believe that 'hanging a lantern' on its partisanship (as it does in the final scene) negates that fact.\n\nP.S. 'ne'er-do-well' does not mean what the writer seems to think it means.  Really, what kind of script-writer seeks to \"translate\" a term STILL IN USAGE TO THIS DAY so that it can be understood by the lowest common denominator?

The first half though was just crap; McKay just kept shifting us back and forth, here and there, while skimping through history without adding anything much to it. I felt that the point where Rumsfeld shuts the door on Cheney after he asks \"What do we believe?\" epitomizes exactly how I felt about the first half: it was an essay film that didn't know what it was trying to say. The second half though, was surprisingly excellent. Maybe it was my disgust towards hearing such history for the first time, and I admit that may have influenced my rating, but damn is McKay a savage on some of those fantastic metaphors. I'm not a Shakespeare guy, so I didn't like that bit, but the mid-credits and then the freeze zooming into Bush as a fish ready to be baited by Cheney was spot on! And that scene at the restaurant! My goodness was that darn amazing. But it was the ending twist on the narrator and the pan on Cheney's old heart, only for his self-centered legacy to continued by his daughter, that smacked me in the face, finally convincing me to forgive McKay for the awful first half. Such a realization of the heavy personal consequences of Cheney's actions, juxtaposed with the way the government had treated it as a game, was to me a powerful and highly timeless message that was very well communicated. Credits as well to Bale, who was electrifying especially in that final scene, where he somehow humanizes Cheney while still portraying him as a bastard. Really liked Carell and Rockwell as well.",

            "content": "Dick Cheney\u00e2(TM)s apprenticeship during Nixon, Ford and Reagan, private sector exodus during Carter and Clinton and ascent to nearly unlimited power as Bush Jr\u00e2(TM)s running mate / handler. It\u00e2(TM)s hopeless to argue that this film doesn\u00e2(TM)t have an agenda - the trailers alone should have made that abundantly clear - and it makes no effort to hide or balance that essential bias. Cheney is played as a man who values nothing beyond personal gain, even going so far as to ask \u00e2what should I believe in\u00e2? during an informal chat early in his career. He\u00e2(TM)s less transparent later on, as his understanding of political gamesmanship improves, and by the time he\u00e2(TM)s asked to join the GOP ticket in 2000, he can ask for the moon.\n\nBasically, we\u00e2(TM)re watching the birth of a hardened super-villain without the inconvenience of actually breaking any laws. Or, I suppose, of being caught for doing so. That\u00e2(TM)s serious subject matter, but the tone varies unexpectedly from grim and straight to playful and silly. Often several times in one scene, which makes for a somewhat confusing viewing experience. It can\u00e2(TM)t decide between hammering an important point and nailing a ripe punchline, valiantly tries to accomplish both and rarely succeeds at either. A gimmicky narrative style and ambitious use of jump cuts further muddy those waters.\n\nThe acting follows suit. Some scenes are rich and effective, Christian Bale becoming the lead role in more than just a physical sense, while others just... don\u00e2(TM)t work? Steve Carrell\u00e2(TM)s casting as Donald Rumsfeld is a good example; a take that could have really come together, but plays instead like a weird mix of his better-known parts in The Office and Anchorman. It\u00e2(TM)s an entertaining film and an important story, with a few hooks that almost sink in, but struggles with tonal inconsistency and an inner conflict that\u00e2(TM)s never completely resolved.",

Yet, as with typical leftist tactics, the movie's writers flip the script and tell the exact opposite of what actually happens to make the liberals look like the good guys. What a straw man fallacy.

            "content": "\u00ef\u00bf 1/2I want you to be my Vice.\u00ef\u00bf 1/2?\n\nComedic writer-director Adam McKay tries, and fails, to bring the same energy and insight from his Oscar nominated examination of the 2008 financial crisis, The Big Short, to the most notorious vice president since Aaron Burr. Vice is the story of the rise to power of Dick Cheney and how he changed the executive branch\u00ef\u00bf 1/2(TM)s use of power forever and for the worse. The film opens with a title card informing the audience that this is an attempt to tell the story of the most secretive figure in recent American political history which is a difficult thing to try. It\u00ef\u00bf 1/2(TM)s not a good sign when before the movie even begins it apologizes for itself.\n\nChristian Bale plays Dick Cheney and we see him first as an aimless drunk in Wyoming in the 1960\u00ef\u00bf 1/2(TM)s that, spurred on by his wife Lynne (Amy Adams), cleans up his act and becomes the right-hand man of Donald Rumsfeld (Steve Carell) during the Nixon and Ford presidencies. Watching him enjoy his quiet accumulation of power and the satisfaction and status it brings during the 70\u00ef\u00bf 1/2(TM)s and 80\u00ef\u00bf 1/2(TM)s is the most interesting segment of the movie. Once the film hits the W. Bush years when Cheney acted behind the scenes to increase his own personal power and wealth Vice should hit its stride, but instead it goes on autopilot and plays like a tired collection of Cheney\u00ef\u00bf 1/2(TM)s greatest hits. Vice is very angry at Dick Cheney and condemns him plenty for his actions but that is like picking low hanging, blatantly obvious fruit.\n\nChristian Bale is great as Dick Cheney. The strength of his performance is, naturally, from his skills and talent as an actor, not just from the makeup he is under and the weight he gained for the role. He speaks with that low growl I remember so well from the W. Bush years and imitates perfectly the small laugh and smile Cheney would sometimes let slip. Cheney was not much of a public speaker or campaigner so his wife Lynne steps up and rallies people to her husband\u00ef\u00bf 1/2(TM)s cause. This is where Amy Adams gets to step out from the bland role of \u00ef\u00bf 1/2wife of a biopic subject\u00ef\u00bf 1/2? to be an active player and interesting character. Bale is nominated for Best Actor and that is no surprise. Amy Adams has earned a Best Supporting Actress nomination, but she played essentially the same character, and played her better, in The Master. Sam Rockwell, in full goofball mode, plays George W. Bush and though he's barely in the movie, Rockwell has picked up a Supporting Actor nomination. \n\nThe life of Cheney is narrated by Jesse Plemons playing an average American and Iraq War veteran who says he\u00ef\u00bf 1/2(TM)s related to Dick Cheney... in a way. When we find out how he\u00ef\u00bf 1/2(TM)s related to Cheney it causes cringes and eye rolls. In The Big Short McKay used a hyperactive and self-aware filmmaking style to excite and engage the audience about a pretty boring and convoluted subject: the stock market and investment banking. He used cameos from stars like Anthony Bourdain and Selena Gomez to explain complex financial ideas and practices using clever and easy to understand metaphors. There is nothing complicated about how Cheney grows and abuses power. He asks a lawyer if what he wants to do is okay. The lawyer says yes. There\u00ef\u00bf 1/2(TM)s nothing hard to follow there but McKay has the narrator hold our hands through it anyway.\n\nCheney\u00ef\u00bf 1/2(TM)s final actions in the movie are meant to play like a final heartless betrayal signifying that he is beyond all hope of redemption, but Vice never presented him as someone with anywhere to fall from. That would only happen with a movie that attempted insight into its subject\u00ef\u00bf 1/2(TM)s emotions and motivations and even dared us to sympathize with the unlikeable main character. In Nixon, Oliver Stone built up audience sympathies for Nixon and then let him squander and betray those sympathies making his fall all the more tragic even though you rooted for him to fail. With Nixon, Stone posed the question: What does it profit a man to gain the world if he loses his soul? (this Bible quote actually appears at the beginning of that film). In Vice, McKay forgot to ask any questions, attempt any insight, or speculate on motivations. This movie has only one message: this Dick Cheney is one bad dude. If you were born before the year 2000, you don\u00ef\u00bf 1/2(TM)t need a movie to tell you that.",

Just like The Big Short, Adam McKay once again blends real-life events with hilarious satire and it works extremely well. The film does a great job of showing us an important moment in history and the man responsible for it. I personally found Vice absolutely hilarious as it often breaks the fourth wall and directly addresses the audience allowing for the audience members to really be their own characters in the film. There was one moment in the middle of the film that I couldn't stop laughing at and I'm so surprised that they were able to do that. It is incredibly funny, super meta and absurd.\n\nChristian Bale absolutely nails the character of Dick Cheney, he is resilient, backstabbing, and ruthlessly ambitious. I almost forgot Bale was playing him until there was a flashback where you could tell that it was him. I was that absorbed in his performance. It is, by far, Bale's best performance. He completely transforms into Dick Cheney. Steve Carell and Amy Adams also give stand out performances. Jesse Plemons has a role in the film which is brilliant and extremely humorous.\n\nMcKay took so many risks making this film. So many things happen that you would never expect in a biopic just for the sake of comedy and I loved it. The editing is incredibly energetic - some of the most ambitious editing being utilized for an incredibly unique narrative structure. This definitely isn't your standard biopic. I love when filmmakers stray away from the standard and break conventions, McKay definitely did just that.\n\nVice definitely isn't a film for everyone (as shown by the mixed reception). The film\u00e2(TM)s highly ambitious narrative structure and editing will turn a lot of people off, and there is absolutely no subtlety, which I personally loved. I really enjoyed McKay\u00e2(TM)s unique approach to the story. Oh, and by the way, the last line of the film is literally \"I can't wait to see the new fast and furious movie that looks lit\" (No I'm not joking)...",

            "content": "Four years ago, Adam McKay made one of the most entertaining and educational films about the economy and the explosion of the great American real estate bubble with The big short. With agile and pop culture language, the director simply explained how some broke down and others profited greatly in the American mortgage crisis. In short, there was a bunch of hawks who caught a chance and went hunting. \"Vice\" follows the same model of language, narrative, and premise. The only difference is that it does not have the same humor. Perhaps there is a slight irony here, another there, but it was really impossible to portray the life of what must have been the most active vice president of American history with humor.\n\n\"Vice\" is the story of a man who was no one and who became the powerful vice president of George W. Bush's government (2001-2009). The film is pitiless with Dick Cheney (a Christian Bale in a state where there are no adjectives to praise him). In the first part, it portrays Cheney like a failure, alcoholic and mediocre student. In the remainder of the film, Cheney is an opportunist who knew how to ride the sealed horse of history and lead himself to the highest echelons of American government with an extremely conservative thought, without measuring any consequences and trampling whoever he wants to be on the ridge of power. And definitely this portrait could not being different.\n\nCheney was for a long time almost a ghost, but the film compacts with and confirms the hypothesis that he was the iron arm of the Bush administration (Sam Rockwell). It was up to him, with a series of maneuvers and counting on the active participation of coreligionists in various instances of power, to stretch US legislation to the utmost to start groundless wars in Afghanistan and Iraq. All with the consent of a weak and almost servile president to Cheney's wishes and who did all the will to have him side on the plate when running for the presidency with Democrat Al Gore.\n\nNarrated by an American soldier, which was a good part of the film, \"Vice\" shows how a mediocre person who had everything to become an irrelevant human being, ended up grabbing an opportunity to do an internship in the US Congress and stuck to right people in power. The first was Donald Rumsfeld (Steve Carrell), Gerald Ford's former chief of staff who also held positions in the Nixon administration and became the Secretary of Defense for the Bush administration.\n\nThe film gives the impression that Cheney was, in fact, an invisible leader to the public of a whole generation of Republicans and the voice of the American conservatives against the \"advances\" implemented by the Democrats who, by the way, occupied the White House. In the case, since Cheney emerged on the political scene, the only presidents from the democrat party were Jimmy Carter and Bil Clinton, who commanded the White House for 12 years. The Republican presidents were four - Gerald Ford, Ronald Reagan, George Bush and George W. Bush - commanding the White House for a total of 23 years. Barack Obama has come to represent the end of the Cheney generation, now 78 years old. But by then much damage was done.\n\nIn fact, the peak of Cheney's power was when he held the vice presidency. Cargo that as the film shows, he only accepted after studying on how to turn it from something he considered insignificant to powerful and without any kind of surveillance. At the same time, it demanded then-candidate Bush the right to take care of a number of strategic areas for the American government, such as energy and the military.\n\nCheney saw the opportunity, as the movie jokes, to become a Galactus, the devourer of worlds in Marvel's comic books. This is how he did it. With the conviction that he was doing the right thing, and the best of Bale's performance is the demonstration of this conviction so real and crystal clear, Cheney turned the world into a worse place by starting a war in Afghanistan against Al-Qaeda to hunt down Osama Bin Laden. But the Bush administration's so-called War on Terror was not enough to win the support of the American population. It took a palatable target for the people. A country with borders and a leader.\n\nIt was in this way that Cheney united the useful to the pleasing, the desire to remove Saddam Hussein from power, and began a war in Iraq with false information and manipulation of news that convinced even the press and the world's leading leaders. In return, what Cheney gained was the direct responsibility for the creation of one of the largest terrorist organizations in the world: the Isis.\n\n\"Vice\" is relentless, didactic and has a cast of actors who only brighten the film further. Bale is a monster in the lead role, but Amy Adams is not far behind making Cheney's wife, Lynne. And there are Steve Carrell and Sam Rockwell very well, as well as actors in smaller roles who have successfully incorporated Mckay's idea of storytelling based on connections with pop culture and agile and light language, even though at various times the film get nauseous.",

The movie is surprisingly lighthearted and gives a do-not-take-me-seriously feel. This is rather ironic given how impactful the decisions and actions of the political figures are. I have not watched a lot of Adam McKay's works, only the Anchorman films. But the way this movie progresses and how the different scenes are cut together actually really reminded me of the Anchorman films. Static images thrown in between moving scenes parallels the one-liners that the Anchorman films are known for. Overall, I highly recommend watching this movie.",

It was truly masterful, and I would barely believe it was him if I didn\u2019t know better. There were some other strong performances as well, but none that were quite as astounding as Bale. The movie takes a look at the history of Cheney\u2019s entire political career from his early days as an aide for Donald Rumsfeld to his years serving as Vice President, but presents it with the same kind of tongue-in-cheek style that Adam McKay used for The Big Short. While I\u2019m no expert, it certainly feels like they approached their research for this film from the standpoint of Dick Cheney being the devil incarnate and made sure they compiled as much evidence as they could find to support that fact. When you walk out of this film the lesson you are left with is that Dick Cheney and his cohorts are responsible for every awful thing in our country today, and we are at risk of future cataclysmic disaster because of him as well. While I\u2019m not a political person, and would never claim to know enough about the inner workings of the government to disagree with what is presented in Vice, it\u2019s the complete lack of subtlety in Adam McKay\u2019s film that bothers me the most. In one scene they give an example of the way Cheney had the ability to propose ridiculous ideas and make them seem reasonable. They present this with a fake conversation where he suggests that the president and his staff walk out on the White House lawn, drop their pants, and twirl their penises around for the media. That\u2019s what watching Vice felt like to me. It was Adam McKay flashing the nation with all the junk he could find about the Bush-Cheney administration, with as much brashness and boldness as he could muster. There were some funny moments and I definitely laughed a few times, particularly when he exaggerated reality or played with the traditions of film-making. Sadly, the film felt too mean-spirited to be convincing or informative. And just to drill that point home, there\u2019s a scene during the end credits that presents anyone who takes issue with what is presented in the film as a violent mad-man unwilling to listen to facts.",

The film is accurate in character development and its script-pleasing artifacts are very different, few habitual, but at one point end up weighing in the rhythm of the long, but end up containing a good part of a long republican political history in just two hours , its weight is normal and the assembly devices serve to relieve it, although in practice this does not work as well.\nTechnically, the feature uses a lot of montage and dictation, leaving everything more frenetic and appropriating several analogies that fit very well, in addition to an excellent sense of humor but not always visible, \"Vice\" can tire many viewers, but those who have already been hooked for their bait, will remain glazed until the end, it is worth highlighting also for the editing and sound mixing that is magnificent, another point that is splendid is their makeup, Bale is unrecognizable, Amy Adams is old, everything is very faithful to the original cartoons and work very well in the film, we already have a guaranteed Oscar here.\nThe film was very acclaimed for its performances, but in fact, Chtistian Bale is great, aggravating his voice and giving a unique weight the same, every time that Dick speaks, it is not in vain, everything has a very strong weight, we owe this to the Bale's vocal work that also gives us a change of physique that goes far beyond makeup, showing a commitment to acting, and finally, his mannerisms, his posture, even the way the protagonist moves his glasses has an air maleficent of wisdom, manipulation and intelligence, is a firm and robust performance, caricature but undoubtedly reliable and accurate. In addition, Amy Adams is well, makes a fundamental character, with much depth and dramatic charge, but its indication to the oscar was exaggerated.\n\"Vice\" finally fulfills his role, is a good movie, addictive, funny, dramatic with depth, script, direction and acting, with some problems is true, abuse of editing and confusing explanation of facts, assertion of events that do not are proven and bar forcing, but we can not fail to see that it is a fiction based on real events, nothing more, but certainly is one of the highlights of 2019.",

If McKay was succinct and accessible before, he seems more superficial and a little simplistic here. Structured like a conventional biopic, but with humourous, surreal even, interjections and tomfoolery to liven up the proceedings while casting aspersions on events and people, the film remains an effective and alarming portrayal of Cheney as a master manipulator, whether against Donald Rumsfeld (an impressive Steve Carrell) or running rings around George W. Bush (a reliable Sam Rockwell who got the nomination that Carrell should have). Vanishing into the roles of the Cheneys, with the aid of subtle yet convincing make-up, Christian Bale and Amy Adams's nuanced, almost humanizing, performances gallantly resist the temptation to simply vilify them as the devil, despite Bale citing Satan as his inspiration in his Golden Globe acceptance speech. However something seems amiss, as this film doesn't feel as sharp or as entertaining as The Big Short. As a result of Cheney's secretive nature and his seemingly very effective removal of any revealing, if not incriminating, records, the film is left with conjectures, suppositions and speculations, and ends up feeling like a condensed run-through of Cheney's career in PowerPoint form. Nevertheless, as a history lesson dressed up as entertainment, Vice is well made, thoughtful and relevant for our times, and scarily ends on a cautionary note that Cheney might not be the worst we will endure in our lifetime.",

            "content": "Paving the way for a biopic of Trump as a Mafia mobster Vice takes a scurrilous and deeply disturbing look at Dick Cheney's personal and political life. Never quite sure whether it's an expose with a human heart, a black comedy of manners or just a simple character assignation Vice rambles on through Dick Cheney's life in roughly chronological order (his early life and DUIs are often in flashback), but there isn't much of that. We also get a seemingly random character who comments on Dick Cheney's life and whose importance does emerge at the end of the film, but in an awkward weird sort of way. \nAwkward and weird could summarise it all - both the film and Cheney. That he was a slick and ruthless political operator is never in doubt and is clearly demonstrated. The only man who outdoes him in smooth, vile self political interest is the vile and oily Donald Rumsfield, who is prone to loud guffaws of dismissive laugher at Cheney  whenever Cheney tries to proffer a decent, or  half-way decent, excuse for what they are doing and why.\n\nIt is suggested that Cheney manipulates his way to unprecedented power as a vice-president. It is in keeping with the strangely dislocated feel of the film to mention now one of the funniest scenes is when a supremely well acted George. W. Bush tries to persuade him to be his running mate with BBQ chicken sauce dripping down his chin.\n \nOne reason to watch this film is for Christian Bale's masterful portrayal of Cheney at different ages - always convincing, almost human you  might think. \n\nDick Cheney patriot or villain? There is no doubt that the film portrays him as a villain and as someone who used his power to support the unsupportable e.g. the torture of enemy combatants, the maintenance of the fiction that Saddam Hussein had WMD and was linked with Al- Qaeda. Another point of view to take from the film might be that American politicians of this calibre and rank are eternally distanced from any of the realities of life and play out their fantasies much like Kevin Spacey in House of Cards. It's not a comforting thought and this is not a comforting film.",

I assumed this movie would be another Hollywood hit job on the right, and it was. I thought at least my leftist girlfriend would like it, but she was ready to leave 10 minutes in - and we should have. \n\nIs it asking too much for an ounce of cleverness, humor, or entertainment like Saturday Night Live? Even the narrator, we discover, is Chenney's heart donor and pissed off that Chenney says \"my new heart\" instead of some other guy's heart. Really? The dead heart donor is mad? Have you ever heard anyone refer to their donor organ as \"John Doe's heart\"?\n\nI don't believe for a minute that most of the academy voters actually watched and voted it best picture - ideology over aesthetics again.\n\nIf you hated Bush/Chenney, then you have a chance of liking this film. I didn't have much of an opinion about Dick Chenney before this movie and not much more afterward. He's a quiet man by nature which we're warned through the ominous epigram: \n\n\"Beware the quiet man. For while others speak, he watches. And while others act, he plans. And when they finally rest...he strikes.\"\n\nAll of the speculation was fully disclaimed in text at the very beginning of the film, \"but we fucking tried\", so that makes it ok to have every speculation be negative.\n\nI'm sure when Hollywood makes Obama's movie, they'll have him eating fried chicken with a piece hanging from his mouth and a scene where he gargles for 20 seconds and spits into the sink.\n\nAll that said, however, the makeup artists were amazing! Christian Bale was amazing in both appearance and intonation. I didn't even recognize Sam Rockwell as George W Bush - what a ringer!\n\nSo the 1/2 star is for the makeup, but I'd like my money and 2.5 hours back.

The director takes a unique, clever, witty approach in telling the story because otherwise you'd just have a story of mindless ambition on the part of all the key players and thoughtlessness for anyone else on the planet except themselves and their greed.  And we've seen that story many times in history.  So the brilliantly talented director almost takes a whimsical approach to this age old avarice and selfishness of the ones that stumbled into power.  Great movie making and depiction of human nature.",

I had no real prior knowledge of Cheney and his activities and I\u00e2(TM)m British so I came at the film with a very open mind. All I can say is that the editing and writing on this film is utterly exceptional and even though at points in the film it feels slightly odd or doesn\u00e2(TM)t particularly make sense within a couple of minutes you fully understand what the editing is trying to portray and is truly great storytelling albeit not particularly traditional. Everything is made clear by the end of the film and by the end you will understand some scenes which previously may not have made sense. The cinematography is delightful and the hair and makeup styling is magnificent they did an incredible job on all the cast members who aged. The score was very good also. And finally Christian Bale is genuinely incredible his performance is utterly brilliant and if he doesn\u00e2(TM)t win an Oscar I will be disgusted he is a true master of method acting and the actual acting as a whole truly brilliant.Amy Adams, Steve Carrel and Sam Rockwell are all exceptional and all Oscar worthy in my opinion or atleast  Oscar nomination worthy, obviously Carrel didn\u00ef\u00bf 1/2 1/2 1/2 1/2 1/2(TM)t receive one but he was terrific non the less. This film has received mixed reviews however I advise people to go into the film open minded and don\u00ef\u00bf 1/2 1/2 1/2 1/2 1/2(TM)t look at it from a political perspective. I also say that wait until the end until you judge the film and lastly the film isn\u00ef\u00bf 1/2 1/2 1/2 1/2 1/2(TM)t conventional and is quirky and different but that\u00ef\u00bf 1/2 1/2 1/2 1/2 1/2(TM)s why it\u00ef\u00bf 1/2 1/2 1/2 1/2 1/2(TM)s genuinely so good.",

Vice was better, but still didn't entertain me as it meant to. The film is often clever and biting but also frequently smug, one-sided and too snaky for its own good. Christian Bale's dedicated performance is the main reason to watch it, as the man always commits 100% to his roles and brings to life whatever character he is playing. His movements, his tonal inflections, the habit of drawing a breath before he speaks, his almost constantly tilted head, he knows Cheney inside and out. There's some great supporting payers toom including Amy Adams, Sam Rockwell and Steve Carrell among others, but overall the film is too scattershot to consistently hit its targets. It's use of a non-linear timeline doesn't improve the story, as it takes away from the message of Cheney's incremental rise to power. It does show just how remarkable an unremarkable person can become, through a combination of luck, resourcefulness and a few underhanded tactics, and I applaud it for telling a story most would rarely have considered. It's quite an achievement, but the movie itself rarely reaches the level greatness that its hero fought hard to attain.",

Using the 'fourth wall' breaking techniques he provided in The Big Short, McKay breaks down Cheney's career in a stop start manner. The approach is not as successful because Cheney is not at all funny. He is as serious and evil as it gets in US politics. From Nixon to W, Cheney was at the centre of the Republican right and went completely power crazed post 9-11.\n\nThe film is a polemic and McKay obviously has it in for Cheney for a host of good reasons.

            "content": "The story of America's most infamous vice president, wager of the War on Terror Dick Cheney, is approached with bold satire here by writer-director Adam McKay. Vice acknowledges from the beginning the secretive nature of Dick Cheney and how conjecture is perhaps needed to colour in the edges. Nevertheless, this is a ferociously entertaining film, that lampoons its subject with flashy comedy and stylistic gags. Christian Bale leads as Cheney, caked in impressive makeup. Beneath the prosthetics, however, Bale delivers a stand-out performance, deadly in its quietness and oozing with callous bureaucracy (the actor thanking Satan for inspiration in his Golden Globe acceptance speech is not unfounded). We watch the events of Cheney's life unfold; his unexpected rise from delinquency to vice presidency is told in a biopic that is pleasingly unconventional. Vice is narrated almost like a staid Michael Moore documentary, but is also unfailingly nihilistic, combining the grounded political history within amusing gags. Similarities can be made with McKay's previous film, The Big Short, which also approaches its weighty subject with a cynical mockery that you can't help but grin at. The deeper impact of this film is certainly undermined by the comedy (which at points is almost too light hearted), but Vice still gives a telling nod to the state of politics today without losing its biting humour.\nVice breezes nicely through a sizeable run time, snapping from frame to frame with a manic energy. The structural choices are somewhat zany, but usually add to the film's eccentricity. McKay's writing is unfocused at points and the narrative is far from tight-knit, though this is never at the expense of entertainment. Fourth wall breaks and a memorable scene where the characters break into Shakespearean iambic pentameter are just examples from a film that is wonderfully weird, yet never to the point of ridiculousness. Stylistic ticks like these are less ubiquitous in a final act that relies just a little too much on narration. \nThough Vice is carried by Christian Bale, Amy Adams looms with stony determination as the Lady Macbeth-esque Lynne and Steve Carrell's Donald Rumsfeld is as slimy as he is energetic (Sam Rockwell's Oscar-nominated George W Bush, in contrast, feels a little bit Saturday Night Live). Nicholas' Britell's score is luscious and pacey and Greig Fraser's cinematography is as slick as it is shocking (shots of Cheney's comfortable White House meetings snap unsettlingly quickly to flashes of the brutal torture he authorises). \nVice is not perfect, its wackiness occasionally verging on messiness, but it remains a fervid and clever biopic, that uncovers the career of one of America's most reticent yet power hungry politicians with delightfully bruising derision.",

In the post credit scene is shown a meta language where the characters know they are in a movie and still use an irony of the \"uncle of the pav\u00e9\", speaking of Fast and Furious, even being mediocre I liked a little.",

A great missed oppurtunity to end on a shot that actually means something, Cheney's exsposed heart. I don't know what it means yet, but thats up to the director to imply. But i was happy wiht the eventual final scene they went with. This film is very similar to The Big Short stylisticly, but th eproblem is that film took place over a year or so. this film takes place over fifty years, so the snappy cuts to real footage has to be narrated by a hamfisted liberal who comes off as plain cringewothy. Instead of following a linear timeline, the film decides to hop back and forth for no appparent reason. Many parreles could have been drawn to earlier points in his life, but perhaps they could be done a bit more subtly. As I previouslt mentioned, most if not all jokes in this film fall flatter than an ironing board, espiaclly the one where they preface the film by saying \"We did a pretty bad job and made amy assumptions but pwease don't blame us, it was weewe haaard\"",

But when one turns out to be a hit-piece for one of the most reviled men to set foot in the oval office, you should pay attention, even if the final result is somewhat flawed. Vice tells the story of Dick Cheney and how he became one of the most powerful men in Washington for decades. It's not flattering and is ABSOLUTELY written from a liberal standpoint. (Surprise, surprise.) Oh sure, there are humanizing moments and Vice does present him as a human being who gambled, made mistakes, and cared about the welfare of his family. But it makes no apology in telling you that Cheney is guilty in helping to create the gigantic cesspit that is American public life today. (Oh, and it points the finger directly at the audience and implicates their complacence in helping to create that nightmare.)\n\nNow let's talk about the tone of Vice. It's framed mostly as a dark comedy with absurd cutaways and a tone that is often farcical. \"Breaking the fourth wall\" is a term everyone says these days in the aftermath of Deadpool, but to put it simply there is NO FOURTH WALL in this film. The entire movie is direct satire and will go to insane lengths to remind you that it is. And I think that's what damaged Vice in the eyes of many critics. I think they wanted a more conventional biopic and found the humor and awkward moments irritating. The director, Adam McKay is largely responsible for its comedic bent, as one look at his filmography would quickly explain. Abstract, non-sequitur humor is kind of his shtick. That being said, the fragmented nature of Vice did irritate me especially during the second half. Many scenes felt obligatory or like small vignettes and didn't flow together well.\n\nWhile Christian Bale and Amy Adams as the Cheney's seems at first glance to be bad casting, they really own it. Bale gets his tics, his speech patterns, and his signature coldness down pat. And yes, his physical transformation represents the kind of commitment actors rarely bother with anymore. Adams likewise plays against her femme-fatale type as a cold and square Lady Macbeth, who is less sympathetic than her infamous husband. Steve Carell is quite entertaining as a loose cannon version of Donald Rumsfeld, and Sam Rockwell doesn't quite look like \"Dubya,\" but he certainly sounded like him and I wished he was onscreen more often.\n\nOverall, Vice is an entertaining, albeit preachy political satire that features fine performances and a few good jokes. It was certainly more diverting than one would expect and on occasion I like to have expectations subverted, if it results in something worthwhile. I think it warrants an investigation.",

The contrast of the dark humor and scathing political satire compared to the corruption and power-thirst of US political leaders was undoubtedly a fine line to tread in this film\u00ef\u00bf 1/2(TM)s production, but this balancing act was expertly-handled by writer and director McKay.\n\nIn addition to the notable acting performances, another remarkably strong aspect of this film was the surgical precision of editor Hank Corwin. Full of montages, time\njumps, and flashbacks, Corwin had to bring his A game, and did nothing less.\n\nAs for the musical score, Nicholas Britell, (who has been busy working on other other projects such as \u00ef\u00bf 1/2If Beale Street Could Talk\u00ef\u00bf 1/2\u00c2?), brings a fittingly unconventional sound to the table that aligns with the film\u00ef\u00bf 1/2(TM)s tone.\n\nGreg Fraser\u00ef\u00bf 1/2(TM)s cinematography engrosses the audience in the emotions of the actors on-screen, with intimate close-ups and symbolic shots that represent the situations of the characters on deeper levels.\n\nRounding things out, the production design crew, led by Patrice Vermette, admirably created realistic sets that flowed with the story as it progressed through the years. The hair and makeup department performed equally as impressively, as did costume designer Susan Matheson.\n\nEach and every single group of the cast and crew did their due part to bring together the masterpiece that is \u00ef\u00bf 1/2Vice.\u00ef\u00bf 1/2\u00c2? This one is definitely on my personal short list for Best Picture as the Oscar race is nearly coming to a close.\n\n \n\nGrade: A",

It may look like a pro-Republican biography, and cleverly, it is only a very critical movie that supports some of the most controversial conspiracy theories, such as 9/11, based on some infamous facts and figures.

This film references a Marvel comics character, it references Shakespeare, it has a narrator who's part is more significant than you think, it even has a fake-out ending after the first 50 minutes.

This film is designed to make the audience angry, but perhaps to a fault (although there were only 5 other people in my screening). This film is definitely not pulling its punches in how it portrays and criticizes Dick Cheney and the state of modern U.S. politics (from the perspectives of both the politicians and the populace).

On a personal note, I\u2019ve never thought it fair that Cheney lives while he\u2019s personally responsible for so many deaths (he is the Hitler/Stalin of the US), and this movie shows that; there is no justice in the world, just men like Cheney and us chatel :(",

            "content": "Known for directing comedies like Anchorman: The Legend of Ron Burgundy, Step Brothers, and The Other Guys (just to name a few), Adam McKay has been taking a slight deviation from his old style. Having recently directed the acclaimed film The Big Short, his comedy met his drama and formed a mesh that a lot of viewers loved. Personally, I wasn't a huge fan of his previous film, so I was a little hesitant on Vice. With that said, Vice is surprisingly one of the best movies that 2018 had to offer. I love when biopics have the freedom of not taking itself too seriously. Yes, there are some very touchy subjects sprinkled throughout the course of this movie, but I had a blast watching it. Aside from awards shows, I don't hear many people talking about this movie, which is a shame, because it's fantastic.\n\nMaybe I just wasn't all that invested in politics enough to know this story, but I found myself very surprised throughout the course of this movie, mainly due to the core focus on Dick Cheney. Vice follows Cheney's rise to power in a very quiet fashion. Having never once been elected President of the United States, his impact on the government was huge. Being an insider who went from bringing people coffee to pretty much running the show for George W. Bush during his Presidency, this story was ripe for exploration. George W. Bush felt obligated to run for President, which in turn made him need a knowledgeable and ambitious person to help him along the way. There are many ways this story could've fallen apart as a feature film, but due to the talent involved, Vice is one of the best of the year.\n\nFrom Christian Bale delivering a stellar, dedicated performance as always, to Sam Rockwell delivering an offbeat and likable performance as George W. Bush, to the likes of Amy Adams and Steve Carell who've always been likable, Vice is littered with terrific performances. Those performances are expected by these people, but I do believe Adam McKay has something to do with that. Whether it's in his older comedies or his recent dramas, he knows where each of his performer's strengths are and showcases them first and foremost. Even in the slower moments of the film, I found myself incredibly engaged, due to the fact that these performances felt so real. Not only do these performances make this a better film, but this is a screenplay that impressed me quite a bit as well.\n\nHaving also been written by Adam McKay, he clearly knew the story he wanted to tell from start to finish. He chose the most interesting period in Dick Cheney's life and went with it. From incredibly weird and interesting choices in terms of where the story starts and stops throughout the course of the movie, I was kind of amazed at how a few scenes didn't crash and burn. Some audiences may find certain choices very strange, but I thought they were experiments that paid off. I can't wait to see what he comes up with as his next project.\n\nIn the end, Vice is the kind of film that would jump at the opportunity to be nominated for numerous awards, but it's also one that deserves the recognition it's receiving. Many of the critics seem to be mixed on this particular film, but that actually shocks me. From weird (in a good way) editing choices to bizarre songs choices, Vice is a movie that meshes a lot of elements together to form a film that feels more like an experiment than a finished product, but that experiment just worked for me in nearly every way. I loved watching Vice and I highly recommend it.",

Whatever - there are many laugh-out-loud moments for me.  It must have been very tempting to call this movie Dick - but I guess there's already an American politics movie called Dick - so Vice.  I'll go 7.8 out of 10 for this.",

There is so much material that is simply guessed and written to sound like a cheesy comic book villain conference instead of trying to sound anything like actual history. This is a story that needs to be told in a truthful way and it rather focused on pouring gasoline on the fire of an already divisive nation by grasping at any straw possible to make Republicans look bad. It's not about Republicans vs. Democrats, its that anyone can be bad given the right amount of opportunity and power, and as a nation, we need to come together to solve this instead of picking sides and shouting we're right and they're wrong. We have to find some way to come together and this does not encourage that.",

While I enjoyed 2005's \"W.\" a bit more this is still a good watch for anyone who has a interest in this era of American Polotics.\nThe humor can be off putting at times and the film does drag in spots but overall its at least worth a watch.\nMy Full Review: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qxf1njyZzyY&t=5s",

A fleshy, sneering Christian Bale skillfully takes us on Cheney's odyssey through the halls of power, from his days as a Nixon-era Capitol Hill intern to his oil grab as Dubya's manipulative, opportunistic (and forever unapologetic) second-in-command.  There's some humor, sure, but given what Cheney conned his boss into doing--in Iraq and elsewhere--hardly enough to turn the film into what could truly be called a comedy.  With Amy Adams as Cheney's flint-hard wife, Lynne, who rescued him from his misspent youth and helped him find his cojones; Steve Carell as a grinning and goofy but no less dangerous Donald Rumsfeld; and Sam Rockwell as the borderline clueless Bush the Younger.  A well-made movie with some awfully clever touches--and, sadly, unmistakable echoes of our current political climate--but an Oscar-worthy masterpiece? No.",

We all know Bush was a puppet, and certainly by now that we went to war unnecessarily based on a lie they concocted linking Saddam to Iraq and nuclear WMD.  They get into that and other atrocities Cheney authorized.  In fact if you're a Republican who voted for George W this movie will either be a revelation or you'll simply get up and walk out.  This is for all the Democrats out there who have been mad as hell about what Cheney did (regarding torture, destabilization of the Middle East, Halliburton etc.) for years.  He certainly laid the groundwork for Trump.  Bale's portrayal is spot-on, and Adams, Carell and Rockwell--all great performances.  Overall Vice gets your blood boiling (if it wasn't already) but there are a few problems with some parts (like the heart transplant for one example).  Still worth watching for the performances, even if it's not 100% accurate.",

I myself have read Cheney's auto-biography as well as many presidential books as that part of America is my own passion. So to be clear I have preference to movies such as this especially when the acting of Adams, Bale and Carrel are amazing. Yet unlike Oliver Stone's Nixon or W the film does not offer a humanity to Cheney. He is a storm of power with little if and or no loyalties. This lack of humanity is at the very core of the film as it suggests that one man alone controlled the world through the ignorance, loyalty or fear of those around him. Sadly it's the fear of you dear Americans that this film is trying to tap into. When voters are straddled to slogans and finger pointing it easily proves the message of this film. It also makes sense of this day and age when Presidents like Trump and Obama who have no governing political experience followed George Bush.",

A mistake so blatant and so obvious that I immediately whipped out my phone to check the running length for the movie I knew I was now about to have to sit through in its entirety. \"Vice\" is also one of the few instances in which a major motion picture release begged the question of \"couldn't this have just been released on Netflix?,\" as there is nothing about this movie that doesn't feel like a painfully quirky mocku-docu-drama for the YouTube crowd. There is no substance, no weight, and absolutely no point to any of it.\n\nTo call this movie biased and non-objective is an understatement. \"Vice\" is so heavy handed and so obtuse in its narrative that it makes Michael Moore seem subtle and compassionate in comparison, and the very trailers for this film suggest an intelligence and linear plots that fail to materialize in the overall actual program. (Looking forward to seeing a lot of Sam Rockwell? Seem like George W. would be a prime character? Prepare to be sorely disappointed.) Even the usually-welcomed presence of Amy Adams seems unnecessary, as almost every aspect of the \"Mrs. Cheney\" character comes across as dull and dead-eyed. This is not due to any fault in Amy Adam's ability, she's merely been given an old egg and told to make it hatch.\n\nI give this movie 1 and 1/2 stars - a full 1 of which belongs just to Christian Bale, who honestly did a fantastic job disappearing into the role. His performance is surprisingly magnificent, which is saying a lot for me as I am not by any means a Christian Bale fan. Unfortunately, no performance by any actor would merit suffering through this awkward abortion of a hipster film-student movie. The only half a star can be shared by Sam Rockwell and Amy Adams, who must have only accepted their parts to pay off some kind of hidden Hollywood gambling debt.",

Just like McKay\u2019s pervious film, The Big Short, Vice is told in a docudrama style with real footage to enhance the utterly frightening & macabre story of Dick Cheney\u2019s rise to be the most ruthless & unapologetic Vice President in US history. The film follows Dick Chaney (Christian Bale) from his party days in college & sloppy lummox days after prompting the ultimatum that his wife Lynne (Amy Adams) gives him after he receives a DUI. Chaney takes it to heart & begins a steady climb in politics beginning as an intern & cultivating a instructive & profitable friendship with Donald Rumsfeld (Steve Carell) which leads to great success in the public & private sectors. By the time then Governor George Bush (Sam Rockwell) approaches him to be Vice President, Chaney is already extremely skilled at ruthlessly acquiring power & position and brokers a deal with Bush which will grant him uncommon decision-making authority & control which he does not hesitate to wield. This impressive all-star cast also features Tyler Perry as Colin Powell, Alison Pill as Mary Cheney, & Lily Rabe as Liz Cheney but Vice totally belongs to Christian Bale, who gives a scary good performance as Dick Cheney. The physical transformation that Bale makes from one character to another, the massive weight loss he did for The Machinist, to buffing up for The Dark Knight trilogy & 40 pounds gain to play Dick Cheney is impressive. It was deeply disturbing to witness the total disregard for the constitution & laws supposedly governing this county by the elected officials & no less disturbing to witness the ruthless betrayal of family as well. Vice was nominated for six Golden Globe awards: Best Picture, Best Director & Best Screenplay (Adam McKay,) as well as Best Supporting Actress (Amy Adams,) Best Supporting Actor (Sam Rockwell.) Christian Bale took home the Golden Globe for Best Actor. SEE THIS FILM.",

            "content": "My spouse and I went to see Vice last night, as we both enjoy history. The previews made the movie appear to be somewhat comedic, which also appealed to us. Sadly, we were disappointed on both counts. This movie is a slow-moving piece of political propaganda that utilizes overt emotional manipulation to couch carefully selected and presented facts such that they appear to be a complete picture of the circumstances surrounding the rise of the Bush-Cheney White House. \n\nWhat I liked about the movie: There were a couple of rather funny scenes, although they were extremely short. The inclusion of \"focus group\" scenes depicting the means by which words were selected for use in advertising, debate in Congress, and speech writing definitely added to the quality of the finished product. These were among the best scenes in the movie, in my opinion. And the actors were well chosen and did a reasonable job with the script, particularly Christian Bale as Cheney.\n\nWhat I did not like: The characters were pretty much flat cartoon versions of the people they were supposed to present. There was no character development whatsoever. No one changed. No one learned anything (with the exception of Cheney when he realized that drinking and carousing was going to lead his wife to leave him). While the sweeping facts in the movie are accurate, the writer started with a preconceived notion of who he wanted Cheney to be, then selected the facts he thought supported that and scripted around them to present the message. This fictionalizes the characters without making the fiction clear and apparent, which means that Mr. McKay is essentially deceiving his audience with intent. Critical events like Desert Storm (during which time Cheney served admirably as Secretary of Defense) are glossed over with barely a mention. McKay's script requires Cheney to be a virtual unknown hidden man, despite the fact that he was actually well-known in political circles. He was, perhaps, not so much a household name as Colin Powell during the 90s, but he was far better known than the movie portrays.\n\nThe lack of any presentation of underlying political philosophy in Cheney's, Rumsfeld's, and Bush's drive to power is inaccurate. It completely ignores the neoconservative movement that was an extremely active and influential subculture of the time. It also contributes to the lack of character development. The only incentive presented for all their effort and financial investment is a desire for power. And while the executive theory was a major philosophical concept of the time, the use of power merely because it is there to be used is a poorly utilized  and inaccurate plot point here.\n\nThe thing I disliked most about the movie is that the points presented were couched in an emotionally manipulating format. For instance, the narrator of the movie is the man whose heart Cheney received in a transplant. The man negatively comments later in the movie that Cheney calls the heart \"my new heart.\" The impression given is that Cheney doesn't care about the life that was lost in the process of saving his. But transplant recipients are not normally given any information about the donors. At the point of the transplant, that did become Cheney's \"new heart.\" An (admittedly generalized) comparison is the purchase of a used car. It is no longer someone else's \"old car,\" but is now the current owner's \"new (to me) car.' They probably won't go about to seek out information about the former owner. They will go on with the things in their lives. Which is pretty much what Cheney has done. Presenting the happy family scenes and the soldier scenes to depict the life of the donor manipulates the viewer into seeing Cheney as heartless and uncaring about the person whose heart he has, as though an unfair and heartrending sacrifice was made for an undeserving lout. I go to movies to be entertained and sometimes informed, not to be manipulated. I resented that deeply.\n\nPerhaps the most telling scene in the movie is the bonus scene at the end of the credits. In the final focus group, one (very conservative) member comments that the movie is a liberal propaganda piece. Another responds that the movie only contains facts. A floor-rolling fist fight between the two characters then ensues, while the other members of the focus group go on with their unrelated conversations. Honestly, this was my favorite scene in the movie, because it portrayed fairly well the way politics plays out in everyday modern life.\n\nOverall, the movie deserves one star for the final scene and for Christian Bale's adaptation of Cheney's speech patterns and mannerisms. But the weaknesses of the plot, the historical inaccuracies, the lack of character development, and the emotional manipulation lead me to grant it no more than that. That movie was a couple of hours of my life I won't get back, sadly.",

            "content": "Vice Review: Vice is the story of Dick Cheney, Christian Bale, and the events leading up to his term as Vice President. I was excited to see this movie because they gave it a comedic route and also all of the actors and actresses in it. When the reviews came out they were very mixed, even getting a bad score by audiences on Rotten Tomatoes. Don\u2019t listen to those reviews, this is a pretty good movie. I thought it brought some great insight and new information to the story that was very interesting. Christian Bale was amazing as Dick Cheney. Bale won the Golden Globe this past Sunday for this role in the Best Actor Comedy/Musical category. He captured him perfectly and with the makeup he looked exactly like him. Amy Adams as Lynne Cheney was also really good. She was nominated for Best Supporting Actress and is a lock for the nominations for the Oscars. Though she probably won\u2019t win, she\u2019s my second choice. Adam McKay did very well writing and directing. His last movie, The Big Short, was also a big contender for the 2016 academy awards. He had an interesting approach to the movie giving it narration, which I\u2019ll get back to in a second, and making it very comedic with the editing style. The editing for his movies, done by Hank Corwin, is always so strange and unique. At the very beginning there were a few sentences on the screen saying how it was a true story but \u201cDick Cheney is a secretive man\u201d and those sentences were the best opening lines of a movie I\u2019ve seen in a while. There was an editing choice done halfway through the movie that I thought was hilarious. Usually a film has three acts to it, but it was more split into two big acts with three small ones within the two. That sounds confusing but it makes sense to me. The narration in the movie, done by Jesse Plemons, was good and had an interesting turn towards the end. I loved it and I think most will. The score for the film was good, as it made the shortlist for the Oscars. I loved the makeup and hairstyling, which probably will win the award. For problems I felt the split between acts was a little weird but that\u2019s because of the story since it didn\u2019t focus on him being Vice President till later. I thought it kind of slowed down more on the second half too. This isn\u2019t a big problem but the title sequence felt too late for me but not many will care about it. The movie was also a little bit long but there was a lot to get in. Overall I thought Vice was a much better film than what people said. A lot of negative reviews came from Republicans so if you fit that criteria I guess be warned if you get offended by these kinds of things. Since this was the film that scored the most Golden Globe nominations this year and you\u2019re into award winning movies, I would check this out. My Grade: B",

Bale is outstanding as Cheney and Amy Adams is equally good as his wife Lynne. McKay fills the film with good performances from Steve Carell as Donald Rumsfeld to Sam Rockwell as Bush.

On humor, it is very hard to beat McKay, weaving out the too-much-political jibber-jabber into a nail biting drama is his first and foremost job, that he makes sure he excels at. There are husbandry gags so witty and hilarious that it mocks the genre itself, when felt to divert the shady or speculative part of the plot to a big extravagant of puppet (literally!), he uses a theme of equivalency medium to communicate on layman terms.\n\nLike when Bale schemes his way up with banal theories of puppets in White House or an eerie homage to Shakespeare or a climatic first act that is nailed down to the credits. McKay's ferocious commitment and confident on his script, is what illuminates it on a much larger scale. The political climate which the film is dipped into isn't just left to inspire or create awareness for the current political climate control, but as an individual persona that Bale is cloaked of, fiddles on where to draw the margin of good or bad as a singular being.\n\nAs far as the structure is concerned, it is pretty much basics, Bale climbs his way up to the ladder by pushing off one or two and being challenged ethically before he ends up losing not only himself but things much more precious to him. The narration is not only meticulous but also funny and fresh to follow, in fact, it may resemble somewhat to Stone's Any Given Sunday, but fortunately the humorisc editing and direction tactics helps McKay stay on the safer side of the coin. Bale being hyped by the media and fans for his bizarre physical transformation clears out any speculations of his choice in our minds within first few minutes.\n\nHis depressed, overly thought out and dodgy character that he maps out on screen, has a perspective of his own. He seems more Chaney than Chaney himself. Plastering a half grin on his face and speaking with less opened mouth as much as possible, he may not be able to melt you down but he sure can ooze power to a point where you might start getting afraid of him. And the characters that writhes around him, including Carell as the sort-of-mentor role has very little do along with Rockwell as the Bush, who too is a victim of a similar infection.\n\nThe only challenging and competitive character against Bale is Adams as the backbone of his, has done an amazing work as his supporter. What the film fumbles upon is having the ability to transact from one sequence to another, there is no flow to the storytelling, no matter how hard McKay convinces you with his camera work. One of the best bit of the film is the narrator whose mysterious appearances keeps you intrigued into this one big speech. Vice should have been a general phenomenon, instead it is Bale's film, from head to toe.",

I actually saw it twice so I thought I'd give this film a shot. I really which I had skipped it. \n\nThis film is what is wrong with the country today. It is not historical or accurate at all, it is intentionally divisive. It is made by someone who clearly deeply hates Republican so much he made an intellectually dishonest movie for people filled with so much hate - which (you would have to ask their shrink) they have decided to focus on anything Republican . The premise of the film is that all Republican politicians are power hungry sociopaths - honestly I would more or less agree with that... but it makes it clear that ONLY Republican politicians are power hungry. \nThere is a scene where Carter moves into the White House and puts up solar panels, then 4 years later Reagan moves into the white house and on day 1 takes them all down. First in 1976 when Carter put them up, all the scientist were in agreement that the Earth was cooling and we were headed towards an ice age. Carter put up the solar panels because of issues with the Middle East and high gas prices... nothing to do with global warming/climate change - but the film implies that was the reason. \nAt the same point in the film, and I can't recall the exact quite from the narrator, but he say Reagan got elected because Republicans discovered a niche in going after the WHITE conservative vote. In 1980 when Reagan was running, 80% of the population was white, 11 percent black and 9 percent other races. To say that Republicans in 1980 \"discovered\" the white vote was ridiculous and intellectually dishonest. \nThen here we have a movie that is about Dick Cheney yet there are many jabs at Trump in 2019... why? Even a photo of Trump holding piles of cash. Why? The movie is about Cheney. \n\nThis movie is for people who are drinking the Kool-aid from politicians, in this case the Democrats. This movie is pure propaganda to fire up the base for 2020. This is not a historical movie. Honestly I feel sorry for anyone who loved or liked this movie. Wake up! \nI will close with repeating I am not a fan of Cheney or Bush. I'm a fan of good historical movies. This is not one.",

I know several who refuse to see Vice solely because it's about Cheney, and then there is a segment who refuse saying it's a left wing, bleeding heart liberal, (along with several other nice accolades), overblown, piece crap. Crazy thing is, it IS based on facts.  As was the case with the turmoil before and after the election of our current... president, facts are accessible to those without a blatant political agenda at all costs, and especially for those who seek it. Then, that's always the hard part; findung that small segment who steps out to verify those things they sense are fake simply by logic and/or awareness of events. That aside, this film demonstrates why I have been a long time fan of Christian Bale, his incredible ability to BE the person portrayed, as well as Brad Pitt one of the producers, whi has long championed the reasons to know the truth.

Of course, I hadn't. I had a bunch of SPAM email, lots of Trump and football hot takes on my Twitter feed, and one text from a friend replying to a question I had asked three hours prior. Obviously I am a very popular and important person. Being the polite and considerate friend that I am, I replied to her text and apologized for the slow response, explaining that I had been at the movies. When my friend asked if I liked the movie, I . . . didn't know. \n\nIt wasn't that I didn't have anything to say about Vice. I had a LOT to say about Vice (obviously, I'm writing a review about it now). There are plenty of movies that after seeing I leave the theater with a shrug, barely remembering them a few hours after the credits roll. That is definitely not Vice. The problem wasn't the movie, it was the question. Did I like it? I didn't know then and still don't exactly know now if I \"liked\" Vice. I sure as hell didn't enjoy it. It was far from a fun and pleasurable experience. I have never left a movie early but I spent most of Vice seething, pondering how much trouble I would get in if I threw my $9.00 bucket of cola at the screen and stormed out in a cloud of profanity. When I saw Spiderman: Into The Spiderverse last week, I wanted it to never end. I would have been happy to spend weeks in that beautiful animated universe, web swinging with Miles and mumbling along to songs we don't quite know the lyrics to. But during Vice? All I wanted was to get out, to get away from that miserable world where greedy, amoral, power hungry leaders can enrich themselves and their friends by lying to the American people and getting hundreds of thousands of people killed. \n\nAfter two hours and twelve minutes of seething, the credits rolled and I breathed a sigh of relief, walking out of that miserable and terrifying world right back into . . . that miserable and terrifying world. So no, friend who's name I won't post on the internet, I did not \"like\" Vice. Not at all. I lived through the Bush/Cheney administration and would strongly prefer to keep those memories where they belong: repressed. But the fact I had such a miserable time in that theater is a testament to how well made and effective Vice is. If I had enjoyed a movie about Dick Cheney, something would have been very wrong, either with the movie or with me. \n\nFive stars for making me feel something. Minus a half star for what it made me feel. F*** you Adam McKay. F*** you Dick Cheney. Now if you'll excuse me I'm going to go see Spiderverse again before I need to go the hospital.",

Note that not one single Republican in the movie was characterized as honorable except Colin Powell.  The war in Iraq was portrayed as some loose conspiracy with corporate America rather than the confusion and decision complexity that the Bush Administration faced in the fearful times after 9/11 when we were still trying to understand who the enemy was and how to fight him.  Saddam had caused a war with Iran that left 1 million people dead. He had invaded his neighbors.  He had gassed tens of thousands of his own people after the U.S. failed to control Iraq after the first war/. He was a psychopath and a bullly who like others such as HItler never stop until they are stopped.  The intelligence about his actions was crude, often second hand and confusing.  In that environment, the Bush Administration chose to invade. What if the intelligence had been correct and the U.S. filed  to invade?  What if Saddam giving $25,000 to the families of suicide bombers had resulted in massive casualties inside the U.S.? Why does Hollywood tell the same old story with the same old demonizing of their political opposition (conservatives, GOP, corporations) instead of a far more intelligent compelling story of trying to make life and death decisions in the fog of war?\nIt sure looks like a lack of creative talent and artistic film-making and political bias.

But I'll say this much; \"Vice's\" biggest drawback may be the fact that it doesn't really wish to seek an audience other than the one it'll most assuredly pocket. The movie is a bit of a political finger-wagging towards those in favor of or even ambivalent towards the figures depicted. Still, Bale's evocation is nothing short of astounding, and it is good to get some kind of take nowadays, instead of the watered down, apolitical cardboard we'd get from a more mainstream version of this material.

It works for the most part, but I will say near the last third of the film it definitely loses some of it's pacing becoming a bit of a slog. The movie stars Christian Bale in an incredible transformation as Vice President Dick Cheney. Bale embodies the character and nails his mannerisms and voice. He went all out Christian Bale on this one and gained a ton of weight as well nailing the physical look. The film goes over Cheney's beginnings from dropping out of Yale, to his start in politics working as an assistant to Donald Rumsfeld (Steve Carell), to his rise in politics and then finally as Vice President during George W. Bush's (Sam Rockwell) Presidential run. The movie definitely paints Cheney as a target the whole time and while it does have lots of facts I tried looking at it as non biased as I could and even I know it definitely changed a few things up such as conversations (which they admit during the movie no one would know what they were saying) and spicing up some events. It definitely paints Cheney as the powerhouse during his time as VP and the crazy amount of stuff that went down under that administration. It's a film that won't be for everyone, but I found it unique (I especially liked the 4th wall breaking it does several times) and I think Bale's performance alone is worth the ticket price!",

I have heard it being sold as a comedy and/or drama and/or satire. I admit up front I am not the best audience for a satire but if there was any it went over my head.\n\nThere is nothing funny about this movie that shows how our country was manipulated and is still paying the price today. While a lot of this may be new or a history lesson to anyone under 30 most of it will be familiar to anyone older.\n\nTurning to the positives the actors all play to their strengths starting with Christian Bale who disappears into Dick Cheney not only with makeup, costume, and adding 45 pounds to his frame but in how he holds himself, talks and walks. As his wife Lynne, if she was really such a strong figure in his life, the woman behind the man who directs all that he does, Amy Adams is strong and both are good enough to make it believable that they would quote Shakespeare in bed!\n\nThe only time I laughed was a very short cameo Alfred Molina has as a waiter in an upscale restaurant telling the power players the 5-6 'specials' such as Guantanamo Bay. Tyler Perry as Colin Powell is almost unrecognizable while Steve Carell as Donald Rumsfeld shows how adaptable people playing the Washington game are. Alison Pill, as the Cheney's lesbian married daughter has the full support of her father while Lily Rabe as her sister doesn't. There are many others in the cast playing famous, infamous and unknown people but the standout performance is by Sam Rockwell as George W. Bush who, in his weakness let Lynne and Dick Cheney run the country.\n\n\"Vice\", even with a stellar cast, is not worth the 132 minutes it lasts or whatever the admission price costs!\n\n(SPOILER)\n\nOh wait!!! Maybe the satire is the phony ending an hour into the movie?",

            "content": "Pretty enjoyable, very funny, but doesn't tell us anything new\n\nOstensibly a biopic of former Vice President Dick Cheney (Christian Bale), Adam McKay's Vice argues that he was actually the de facto President, with George W. Bush (Sam Rockwell) taking a back seat, particularly in the globally crucial years from 2001-2003. Much as was the case with BlacKkKlansman (2018), Vice has one eye on the here and now, using Cheney's story as a vehicle to examine the current political climate in the US. However, although there are individual moments of brilliance, the film doesn't actually have a huge amount to say.\n\nBeginning in Wyoming in 1963 as a young Cheney is arrested for drunk driving for the second time, the film then cuts to the Presidential Emergency Operations Center in the immediate aftermath of 9/11, as Cheney orders the shooting down of any suspicious commercial airliners, despite Bush not signing off on such an order. How he got from the first point to the second is the film's main focus.\n\nPresented as devoid of ideology, with a Zelig-esque ability to alter his mannerisms, McKay's Cheney has no interest in attaining power so as to influence policy or stimulate ideological change, he is obsessed only with power-for-power's sake. One telling scene sees him ask Donald Rusmfeld (Steve Carrell), \"what do we believe?\", only to be met with laughter. He's also portrayed as a mercenary; a chilling scene sees him give his daughter Liz (Lily Rabe) permission to condemn gay marriage, despite his other daughter, Mary (Alison Pill), being married to a woman.\n\nAs with The Big Short (2015), Vice is aesthetically audacious, cut by Hank Corwin in a similar manner to the \"horizontal editing\" Oliver Stone pioneered in his 90s films. For example, as Chaney attempts to manipulate Bush into agreeing to give him more power, there are intercepts of fly-fishing. In another scene, when he first learns of the Unitary Executive Theory, there is a shot of a lion bringing down a gazelle.\n\nAlso similar to The Big Short is the film's irreverent tone. A particularly sardonic scene comes about an hour in, as the film shows Cheney turning down Bush when he asks him to be his running mate in 2000. At this point, the legend explains that Cheney had chosen family over politics, and that he happily lived out his days in Wyoming. As the Cheneys gather around a family barbeque, triumphant music swells, and the closing credits start to roll, only for the movie to interrupt itself, pointing out that that's not what happened. It's a very meta technique, and one which mocks feel-good biopics. Another very funny scene sees Cheney and his wife Lynne (Amy Adams) speaking in iambic pentameter after the narrator points out, \"we can't just snap into a Shakespearean soliloquy that dramatises every feeling and emotion.\" In another scene, a waiter reads from a menu that features various forms of Cheney-endorsed torture. A hilarious mid-credit scene sees a focus group descend into chaos when a conservative calls a liberal a \"libtard\", prompting a mass brawl, whilst two young girls ignore it so as to speculate about the new Fast & the Furious film. \n\nFor all that, however, Vice isn't a patch on The Big Short, for a number of reasons. For example, whereas in The Big Short, the self-reflexive Tristram Shandy-style narrative structure worked to the film's advantage, providing a way into the complex story, here it has the exact opposite effect, oftentimes distracting from McKay's thematic concerns. \n\nThe most egregious problem is that the film fails to give any kind of psychological verisimilitude to Cheney, depicting his various deeds without offering much in terms of motivations. Is he simply an opportunist? Is he an evil megalomaniac fuelled by a deeper purpose, and if so, what purpose, and how? Could it all really have been about power? The film's Cheney is ultimately unknowable, and that makes his acts more excusable.\n\nCheney pressured the CIA to find non-existent links between Al-Qaeda and Saddam Hussein so as to justify an illegal invasion of Iraq. He oversaw the public relations campaign to build popular support for the war. He encouraged the torture of terror suspects all the while denying it was torture. He was responsible for the worst strategic blunder in US history, the growth of a domestic surveillance state, the dictatorialisation of the office of the President, and the deaths of 4,000 American troops and at least 100,000 Iraqi civilians. Positing him as a man who was power-mad and little else, Vice remains always on the outside, never managing to open the door and expose his actual inner workings. The comedy and structural experimentation make it entertaining, but it tells us very little about Cheney that we didn't already know. Strip away the artifice, and you'll find it doesn't have a huge amount to say, and rather than exposing Cheney's dark soul, the film argues that he doesn't have one. And that is a far less interesting thesis.",

            "content": "December 25, 2018\n\nHospital technician: \"Dick Cheney-great American.\"\n\nDirector Adam McKay: \"Well, it's complicated.\"\n\nThis exchange took place as McKay was having a stent put in after suffering a heart attack. It was during the production of McKay's \"Vice,\" and just like the subject of his film-former Vice President Dick Cheney-McKay essentially knew when his heart attack was coming. He couldn't catch his breath and he felt queasy in his stomach. Dick Cheney felt this way often enough that he could give his family and staff members ample heads up that another attack was coming. \"Better get the car ready,\" he'd say.\n\nIt's a shame \"Vice\" itself isn't as amusing or interesting as this ironic anecdote, because I've no doubt Cheney is indeed a complicated man (what human isn't?), and any attempt to make a biopic about him would surely be a challenging yet exciting feat for any filmmaker. In fact, McKay's film opens with the subtitle, \"The following is based on a true story. Or as true as it can be given that Dick Cheney is known as one of the most secretive leaders in history. We did our f***ing best.\"\n\nUnfortunately, McKay's best isn't good enough, at least not here. He's certainly a gifted storyteller, and there are moments in \"Vice\" when you think it will break out of its shell and have the audacity to transform into something other than a typical \"political figure biopic.\" But such moments are short-lived and the movie spends most of its time being a mere manifestation of the thoughts and opinions of the liberal choir to whom McKay and his team are obviously preaching. Yes, there are some interesting tidbits peppered throughout and we leave the theater feeling as though we learned a few new things about the enigmatic Cheney, but it ultimately doesn't challenge or really play with what we already thought about him going in.\n\nThis is disappointing news to report, especially given the caliber of talent in front of and behind the camera. Christian Bale, who was so memorable in McKay's semi-overlooked (and much more compelling) \"The Big Short,\" is almost unrecognizable and uncanny in the way he looks, speaks and carries himself like the real Dick Cheney. He certainly did his homework in terms of getting Cheney's posture, mannerisms and body language down, and the film's makeup team must also be applauded for making it seem like Cheney volunteered to play himself on-screen. \n\nIt's an impressive and convincing physical recreation to be sure, but while it's one thing to nail the look of a man, it's another, more important thing to reveal the heart of him and expose his inner soul and motivations, and McKay's screenplay and storytelling strategies don't quite get the job done. \n\nThat's not to say the film lacks good intentions or that it doesn't have an interesting agenda, which are to shed some light on just how the towering, mysterious Cheney, through sheer determination, calculated conversations, and sometimes the sacrificing of his own family and health, was able to wield his command to make the office of the Vice President of the United States more than just a thankless, symbolic job. It also wants to show just how far-reaching the ramifications of Cheney's decisions were and continue to be, which many viewers, including myself, might have never considered.\n\nBut if the intentions of \"Vice\" are bold and ambitious, the means by which it carries them out are conventional by comparison. Sure, the film has a definitive attitude and dark sense of humor throughout, but overall it adheres too rigidly to the traditional biopic structure. This makes it frustrating to watch because there are a few inspired scenes that go against the grain and make us believe the film will stray from its typical path and really mold itself into something special. These moments excite us and catch us off guard, but they're also transitory, and when the film comes back down to Earth, we feel let down by its unrealized possibilities.  \n\nAppropriately, the vision I have for the way \"Vice\" operates is the same way a young Dick Cheney drives drunk in 1963, swerving off and on a country road in Wyoming, where he and his high school sweetheart, and future wife, Lynne (Amy Adams), grew up. Lynne makes it clear to Dick she'll leave him if she has to bail him out of jail a third time for drunkenness (this is after he got kicked out of Yale), and this scares Dick straight. By 1969 he's no longer swerving off the road but instead working as intern at the White House during the Nixon administration, reporting to none other than Chief of Staff Donald Rumsfeld (an over-the-top Steve Carrell, who makes Rumsfeld too much of a caricature).\n\nFrom this point on, \"Vice\" more or less continues on a straight path not unlike the one Cheney set himself on, going through the standard biopic motions of summarizing the major events and positions he held during his 40-year political and private-sector careers. An unnamed narrator (Jesse Plemons), a veteran of the Afghanistan and Iraq Wars, gives us the play by play as Cheney gets his own stint as Chief of Staff under Gerald Ford (Bill Camp); serves as Secretary of Defense under George H.W. Bush (John Hillner), who made him a key overseer of Operation Desert Storm; becomes Chairman and CEO of Halliburton, the oft-ill-though-of oil company; and eventually Vice President to George W. Bush (Sam Rockwell).\n\nThe film purports this last position only happened because Cheney demanded certain provisos be in order that would essentially make him the puppet master of the second Bush administration, virtually without any oversight, which he surreptitiously fine-tuned with the help of his legal counsel David Addington (Don McManus) and Chief of Staff Scooter Libby (Justin Kirk), not to mention the loosely defined unitary executive theory. \n\nAll of these are sequences are inherently interesting, I suppose, and they're presented and performed serviceably, but I wanted \"Vice\" to keep swerving off the road like Cheney did back in his youth, because the few times it does, it shows some real potential as a risky, compelling dramedy instead of just an adequate biography. \n\nTake, for instance, a moment about a third of the way through, when the movie pretends to be over. The credits roll and everything, and the film gives us the false hope Cheney's career ended after George H.W. Bush lost the 1992 presidential election to Bill Clinton. We figure the film might hit a stride and break in its ways to become more inventive and experimental with its presentation. The same goes for a scene featuring Alfred Molina as a waiter in an upscale D.C. restaurant, where Cheney and his cohorts order devious compromises of the U.S. Constitution off the menu without thinking twice about them (\"We'll have one of everything.\"). There's also a bizarre exchange between Dick and Lynne as they lay in bed and suddenly speak like two characters in a Shakespeare drama plotting something sinister.\n\nBut these moments prove to be just temporary gags before the film returns to its more familiar territory and continues as a straightforward account of the major headlines and left-wing conspiracy theories surrounding Cheney, including his viewing the 9/11 attacks as an \"opportunity\" to seize control of Iraq, which he jumpstarted by claiming Saddam Hussein had links to Al-Qaeda and possessed weapons of mass destruction; or deliberately leaking Valerie Plame's identity as an undercover CIA agent because her journalist husband, Joseph C. Wilson, wrote an op-ed piece stating his doubts that Iraq purchased uranium from Niger; and Cheney accidentally shooting Harry Whittington on a hunting trip. If you watched the news at all during Cheney's time in office, these events will simply ring in your head as, \"Oh yeah, I remember that.\"\n\nBy the end, \"Vice\" suggests that just about every major domestic, international, humanity crisis, social injustice, etc. issue we face today is linked, in some way, shape or form, to Cheney's past decisions and policies, from the rise of ISIS to the deaths of fleeing refugees. And while I don't deny his choices played some key role in their existence, the way the film presents them makes it feel scrambled and jarring. Our impression is that McKay has allowed himself to get carried away with his mission to expose this guy for who he is and is trying to cram everything in just so he can get his liberal point across, as if this was his only shot to do so. But this overeager strategy dilutes the film's effect and it loses focus. At the same time, we lose interest.\n\nWhat's interesting is that Bale has said he wanted to find the humanity in Cheney, to get away from the idea that he's \"all villain,\" and that even abhorrent people like him can still make wonderful company. But the film doesn't take that approach. Instead, it leans completely to the left, which is a shame, because a neutral position would have made Cheney a more interesting filmic character and demystified him as a looming political figure. And while do see some of his humanity, as when he tells his youngest daughter, Mary (Allison Pill), that \"We will accept you no matter what,\" when she tells him and Lynne she's a lesbian, the film makes it a point to show he went back on this promise when his eldest daughter, Liz (Lily Rabe), made a bid for Wyoming senator and refuses to support same-sex marriage. I realize this really happened, but the film's biased position comes across too heavily and doesn't allow enough time to show or even suggest that perhaps Cheney really struggled with his decisions. It doesn't entertain the possibility that he wasn't always so hasty and impulsive just to maintain power. Its strict point of view limits our engagement with the material.\n\nFor me, \"Vice\" ultimately accomplished too little in its attempt to tell me something new about Dick Cheney that I didn't already assume, and I've a feeling most viewers of my liberal persuasion will feel the same way, while those on the other end of the spectrum will see it as just another attack from the left. This makes us wonder what the value of the film is and has us asking, why see it? Despite McKay and his cast's valiant efforts, I can't provide a good answer. Oddly enough, after reading Cheney's autobiography, McKay thought to himself, \"This is a guy who has really done everything he can to not have a movie made about him.\" Perhaps he should have heeded that thought more and moved on to another project.",

Although I loved The Big Short and Adam McKay's dynamic filming style, I think many in the audience (including myself) were sitting, patiently waiting for the film to arrive at a point. To me, the ultimate conclusion was that Dick Cheney was an ambitious, but power-hungry and flawed person who's goals and political tendencies hurt the country in immeasurable ways. Perhaps McKay's frequent shift to the \"Unitary Executive Theory\" and dramatization of meetings with VP's counsel and soon-to-be Justice Scalia seemed to be an airing-out of McKay's grievances with conservative views about executive power and conservatism, as a whole. Given those dramatized interviews and pre-film warning label on accuracy, it almost looked like we were watching a Democratic Socialists of America political ad for 75% of the movie. However, toward the end, it seemed as though the film finally arrived at the point. Good movie but expected a little more of a serious biopic and/or assessment of Cheney's life, like The Big Short was an honest and somewhat-satirical postmortem of the 2008 financial crisis.",

            "content": "Pulling the strings.  So this is the unsung story of Dick Chaney (Christian Bale), the Vice President during the George W. Bush administration.  It tells his quiet rise to power, and how he ultimately positioned himself to be in a role that was more powerful than the President himself.  I deeply respect the work that Adam McKay is now doing; he spent the better part of his career directing Will Ferrell comedies (for better or worse), and now that he has paid his dues, he wants to tell these real life stories that lift the veil on ugliness that some would rather have forgotten.  Much like The Big Short, he has once again put together all the pieces to make a movie that is going to take home a lot of nominations and awards.  Now I went in well-aware that this may be a movie that will leave you feeling some kind of way, and it did not disappoint.  It is currently a very tense political climate in the United States, and I feel like this movie exists for all the people out there getting rose-colored glasses for the Bush administration, viewing them as the good old days because so many processes are broken right now.  Those days really shouldn't be idolized when you look at what was really going on, and that is what Vice is all about.  These are really some unflattering parts presented, and it ends up being an actor's movie; there is nothing sexy about any of these pudgy roles, but all of the actors commit and breathe a whole lot of life into the story.  Christian Bale is such an extreme actor, and while I bet it was probably a good time gaining weight for a role for a change of pace for this total transformation, he still puts in the work learning all of the mannerisms of a real life character.  Much like Frank Langella in Frost/Nixon, he doesn't look like a dead ringer, but he gets so much right that he completely becomes the person.  All of the details that you hope to get from an Oscar contender are present, and this is most definitely in the upper echelon of movies of the year.  I think that the editing is particularly great and noteworthy, and it completely makes its point, showing just how slimy this got.  The only small issue I take with this is the same that I had with The Big Short: it is sold as a comedy, but it is about a subject matter that really isn't funny.  It is pretty hysterical whenever Chaney has a heart attack, but other than that, this is a mostly serious story about a snake in the grass.  It is still something that you absolutely need to watch if you enjoy watching award contenders.",

The liberties taken with fact, legal theory and interpretation are stretched so thin that at multiple moments incorrect and blatantly biased information is not only relayed through the characters, but actually put forth in text format for the viewers.  Viewers hoping for a Big Short round two will find instead a highly colorized and thinly veiled mini-series that is propaganda in all but name (and even there draws close), with actual no-joke subliminal messaging included.  \nGreat acting, particularly from Bale and Carell, shines in this film... and was the main reason the two loudly complaining individuals in front of us did not walk out... and the makeup team deserves fifteen Oscars.  On the other hand, the usually great Amy Adams is given little to work with from the script, and many of the supporting cast barely rise beyond an SNL skit.  \nPerhaps one can forgive some of the travesty in Vice when remembering that, like Inglorious Bastards, it is not a documentary.

It's interesting because of the style employed, somewhat similar to director Adam Mckay's The Big Short. You get narration from Jesse Plemons, in a surprising role, and Naomi Watts uncredited, as the film traces Cheney's rise from college drop out to the man behind president George W Bush, who is portrayed as very un-presidential by Sam Rockwell, around the time of the 9/11 attack on New York. It doesn't have the same impact as The Big Short and isn't as tight but if the story is true (I don't follow American politics) then the man is a genius. There are some amusing scenes, a fake mid movie credits scene, and the narrations aren't bad. Performance wise, Bale has proven to be quite a shape shifter over the years and appears to have Cheney's look pretty close, it's an excellent cast including Amy Adams and Steve Carrell, and if Bush was actually like Rockwell's portrayal then you've got to wonder how he could ever be president, even as a puppet for Cheney.

            "content": "The most telling moment in \"Vice\" occurs early on.  After landing an internship in Congress and falling under the spell of Donald Rumsfeld (Steve Carell), Dick Cheney (Christian Bale) plaintively inquires of his mentor, \"... but what do we believe?\"  The implication that Cheney has no belief system of his own is jarring; that Rumsfeld's response is to laugh hysterically and slam the door in Cheney's face is even more devastating.  We are forewarned that this is a film about gaining and using power.\n\nThe film follows the ascent of Dick Cheney from his low point in 1963  - a Yale dropout who has dissolved into a drunken laborer stringing telephone wire in Wyoming.  In short order, Cheney is whipped into shape by his wife Lynne (Amy Adams).  After securing his internship, Cheney works himself into positions in the Nixon and Ford administrations.  He then serves five terms as Wyoming's single congressman (1979-1989) before becoming Secretary of Defense for George H.W. Bush (1989-1993) and eventually Vice President under George W. Bush.\n\nWhat's absent from this film is any theory, or even speculation, about what motivates Cheney and his drive for power.  By the time, Cheney has become Secretary of Defense, he has fully embraced a Hobbesian world view - all people are selfish and self-serving, best ruled by an absolute monarch (which explains his obsession with \"the unitary executive\").  But there's no real discussion about how he arrived at this perspective.  After informing the viewer in the opening credits that, because of Cheney's secretive nature, the film is filled with speculation, writer/director Adam McKay fails to address Cheney's internal motivation in any meaningful way.  That Cheney is so unapologetic for his decisions in the film's final scene makes this lack of exploration a glaring oversight.\n\n\"Vice\" is a scathing take-down of the man who brought us the war in Iraq.  McKay's further explanation of how incestuously the core characters are intertwined (Antonin Scalia, Rumsfeld's evolving roles) is illuminating.  And along the way, there are theatrical flourishes that make this movie soar.  The alternative life scenario for Cheney in the middle of film, accompanied by its own closing credits is priceless.  Jesse Plemmons (excellent in the 2015 installment of the \"Fargo\" TV series) as narrator adds exposition and acerbic commentary that provide impetus to the story.  For those who loved the rhythm and texture of \"The Big Short\" (one of McKay's earlier writer/director efforts), there are some similarly inspired digressions, although none rise to the excellence of Margot Robbie in a bubble bath, drinking champagne and explaining the financial  underpinnings of subprime mortgages.\n\nThe cast is first-rate, although many seem to have been cast primarily for their visual similarity to the person they portray.  Bale, as usual, fully immerses in his character, taking on an eerie physical similarity to Cheney and spot-on delivery of Cheney's speech pattern.  Carell's Rumsfeld is convincingly charming, profane and amoral.  Sam Rockwell (George W. Bush) is simply amazing - dynamically conveying W's impulsive, erratic, \"oh, wow!\" world view.  Tyler Perry as Colin Powell is the only truly curious choice.\n\nOne wonders about the intended audience for \"Vice.\"  Most adults have a general familiarity with Cheney.  Those who already hold W. and Cheney in disdain will simply have their views reinforced - although some of the details in this movie may cause them to foam at the mouth.  The film is so brutally unflattering that it will alienate those on the political right.  However, in a world of \"fake news\" and \"alternative facts,\" it's nice to explore characters who can be so transparently, unabashedly wrong.",

Bale and Amy Adams, as Dick's wife, Lynn Cheney, are the only actors who appear to take their roles seriously.

Several other casting decisions were made for fame appeal and are let downs, including Sam Rockwell's George W, Steve Carrell's Don Rumsfeld. For my money, most egregiously Tyler Perry as Colin Powell in the United Nations feels like his character addressing StarFleet Academy. When the lights come up, director Adam McKay's film leaves us to ponder many what-ifs. While this educational fourth wall breaking style was perfect in 2015's The Big Short (also with Bale), here it takes my eye off the subject, executive branch power,  and puts it on the director's insecurity. McKay knows that recent political history is an intellectual exercise that most would prefer to avoid in their entertainment time, and unfortunately he lets us know that he knows. The movie is a little dispiriting, not so much in execution as in saying that the emperor's movers and shakers doesn't believe in anything.  If so, what is the point?",

His previous film, the glorious The Big Short, skewered big business and finance. This one goes after Washington politics and more specifically the odious Dick Cheney, who is most famous for being Vice President in the Bush administration. Christian Bale is truly transformative as Cheney, a quite remarkable performance. We follow Cheney from his reckless days in Wyoming through to his introduction to Washington in the Nixon and Ford administrations. We also get a sense of his lifelong relationship with his devoted and strong wife Lynne (Amy Adams). This is all very well handled and we do get a sense of Cheney the man. However that sense is that Cheney was really in it for the sake of power and not much else. He seemed devoid of essential humanity. I do wish through there was more time spent on his Vice Presidency. There is a good set up on how he basically contrived to run the country and not Bush. But it all feels a little rushed and scatter shot. I do feel feel the film lacks in the editing department giving us chunks of information but maybe not cobbled together in the best possible way. It is entertaining though and also illuminating. Just felt like it could have gone from good to great.

And this is something that 'Vice' suffers from greatly. Sure, there is a strong thesis to this film that somewhat holds it all together but the individual segments often feel way too brief and unexplored to fully express the drama. \n\nAll of this being said, if I have to watch a movie that suffers from my usual biopic issues I want it to be a movie directed with Adam McKay's creative flair and a cast as good as the one assembled here. The combination of these two elements help 'Vice' overcome the biopic shortcomings and into something that I genuinely really enjoyed watching. Bale is just insanely uncanny and brilliant as Cheney and has some stunning support with Adams, Carrell, and a truly excellent Sam Rockwell next to him. \n\nIn a perfect world this cast would have been utilized for a TV series exploring Cheney's life in more detail but instead this is a highly entertaining CliffsNotes version of modern American history.",

At its climax, it attempts to slip one by the average audience member, albeit less tactfully, by flashing us with images of migrant children at our nations border and the California wildfires peppered between dramatic bombings of Iraq. Only one of those is related in any direct way to former Vice President Dick Cheney, the protagonist/antagonist of the film. This was the most outrageous moment of the film, aside from McKay momentarily assaulting us with blurry close-up shots of people's eyes, which can be attributed to his flashy style. Aside from those complaints, I quite liked the film.\n\tMcKay makes me laugh, and somehow manages to make me think more deeply about ruthless pragmatism at the same time. He also makes me think about how the most seemingly inconsequential and uninteresting bureaucracies can destroy lives; how government tyranny can permeate under our noses; how executive authority has changed over the recent decades; and how a monumental tragedy can create an existential crisis that changes the way millions of people think about the world. The most poignant of moments was in the finale, when President Bush, portrayed by Sam Rockwell, shakes his leg in anxiety as he announces our invasion of Iraq to the nation. The film then cuts to someone shaking their leg in fear with their family as the bombs begin to fall. \n\tThe acting is incredible, and Christian Bale looks uncannily similar to Dick Cheney, as he masterfully captures the mannerisms of an almost ghostly figure to people younger than 25 years old. I would wager that 95% of people my age do not even know who Dick Cheney is. They should see this movie, and I am confident they will at least be entertained, and maybe they will look up more information on who this man is. Hopefully, they will reach the same conclusions as I did; that Dick Cheney set in motion a horrific response to a horrific act. At the end of the movie, Cheney breaks the fourth wall and tells the audience his justification, without apology, for his actions. There are certainly monsters in this world, and they should be dealt with. However, there are many signs that point to Cheney being one of them.\n\tThis brings me to the central question the film poses, and this may have been unintentional, but nonetheless, it was apparent to me. At what point is pragmatism immoral, and will the inevitable progression of governmental power in the name of pragmatism eventually lead to tyranny? This film says it already has, and makes the claim it will become worse. I think both sides of our current political bareknuckle fight can agree that the endless expansion of executive authority has already damaged our reputation as a country, has caused death and destruction, and will lead to more tragedy. Even though Dick Cheney probably does care about his family more than his political dynasty and George W. Bush is certainly more than just a bumbling idiot, I think Vice poses important questions that we should all strive to answer.",

It suffers from an obvious bias from a liberal director to purposely portray the central figure, Dick Cheney, as some sort  of Darth Vader. For example, he uses dark colored backgrounds frequently when filming Cheney yet shows footage of Obama's first swearing in ceremony in bright colors with a smiling Obama. The film plays as a pseudo documentary. The only thing that is missing is Michael Moore.\n\nThe first half of the movie which depicted Cheney's early years as a young man and his subsequent marriage and struggles was very interesting. The second half when he actually becomes the VP to George W. Bush was actually kind of boring. I'm sure McKay meant for this part to be the meat of the film with the War on Iraq but I found it uninteresting and somewhat boring because we've already heard this stuff, e.g., there were no weapons of mass destruction found in Iraq, the war was unwarranted, etc. \n\nIn a Christmas movie season full of so many mediocre and bad films,  e.g.Holmes and Watson, I was hoping this would be that one gem since it had Christian Bale. But even he couldn't lift this film from mediocrity. I think with a different director it may have done better but the reality is that aside from Cheney's time  as VP during 9/11 and the Gulf War, he has lead a fairly typical life. \n\nUltimately, the movie suffers from not being an honest biopic but instead a thinly veiled anti-Republican propaganda film.",

But man, this movie really disappointed me and I can't quite put my finger on why. I think it mostly has to do with the disparate styles and cuts and flashback and fast-forwards. There were serious moments that would be punctuated by a completely out-of-place social commentary, break-the-4th-wall scene that totally took me out of the movie. I had no problem walking out of this movie twice to quickly go to the bathroom. The acting, however, was SO GOOD. With the exception of Steve Carell, who sounds like he's playing himself, Christian Bale and Amy Adams deliver tour de force performances. Alas, this was probably my biggest disappointment of the year.",

My military career spanned the Bush-Cheney Administration and Iraq war and I'm glad this movie was made and the details of their actions have been documented in this film since most people won't do the additional research as I have to know that this is spot-on. This movie is very much worth seeing and provides plenty of entertainment while informing individuals how power was abused, taxes were wasted, and many lives were impacted and will continue to be impacted for years.

Obviously scenes such as Lynne and Dick in the bedroom quoting to each other are fabricated and I thought quite funny. There is plenty of tongue-in-cheek humor. The acting is excellent and Bale should be nominated for his performance. I enjoyed the references to Roger Ailes, Alito, Rumsfeld, FOX, Norquist, Rove, etc. The movie shows a darkness inside the White House led by Cheney in a quiet but intentional way - self-driven to be in power. The movie hits on how the conservatives changed their messaging to use the phrase \u201cdeath tax\u201d to get Americans to want to get rid of the inheritance tax which in reality affected only the wealthy Americans. Also nailed the Iraq War under false pretense etc. Hit the torture issue as well. Also touched on the fact Zarkowi went back to Iraq after the war and started the Isis group. The W administration (Cheney) is responsible for ISIS. The conservatives tried to blame O for this. The director inserted a number of interesting visuals, cuts and perspectives, etc. I found the movie wildly entertaining.

He IS Cheney. Amy Adams gave a credible performance as Lynne Cheney who was as ambitious as Dick Cheney, maybe more so. The actor who played George W. Bush sounded and sometimes looked like him. It was uncanny.

The US campaign in Iraq was an unmitigated disaster - we entered the war on bogus information, were lied to about its justification had no strategy for peace and the resulting mess helped give rise to ISIS while enriched companies such as Halliburton.

I found the script, acting, editing, music all very good with plenty of entertaining twists. There's also scads of toe-curling, inside-the-Beltway villainous political machinations to make you laugh and shudder at the same time. In the end we see how Cheney's power lust, misbegotten patriotism and ultimately tragic, even sympathetic career helped greatly advance the darker side of our national actions. To envelop that in a film with humor and tell it coherently is worthy. Bale, Rockwell, Carell and Adams were all well cast. A romp, and a horror show, and a history lesson, a reminder to give a damn as a citizen and vote... and a great escape. Glad I went.",

I loved the camera work (especially the times Bale is filmed at an angle that makes him look menacing) and the editing is stellar.

I was hoping to see a smart satire about a figure that hasn't been explored. The continual wink-wink/nod-nod cheesiness combined with its arrogant self-satisfaction gets in the way of that story.

The attempt to connect Cheney to Trump with sub conscious background imagery is laughable and a cute attempt at brainwashing.

After seeing this film, I can now say that I still know nothing. The only thing this film does is make it seem that Dick Cheney is directly responsible for all the problems that have plagued the United States for the past 20 years, like the creation of ISIS. This film takes us deep into the thoughts and private conversations of Dick Cheney and paints him, and any right leaning person or organization, as either evil or power crazed and after very little research done by myself I have been able to find that many of these scenes were untrue as people who were apart of these events have spoken up about the inaccuracies of this movie. As I am looking at the past works of Adam McKay, I see mostly comedies which is no surprise to me as evident by his comical and completely disrespectful portrayal of George W. Bush, a Yale educated man, as an unintelligent man who is thought down upon by even his father. The only redeeming quality of this film was in the acting which I will say was superb, especially from Christian Bale. The thing that worries me the most about this film is that my generation will be so naive as to take all the ideas that this film tries to broadcast as factual and be brainwashed into having this skewed perception of Dick Cheney and the George W. Bush administration, which I know was far from perfect but was not the epitome of almost pure evil as this film leads one to believe.",

While the timeline can be as erratic as the behavior of the younger Mr. Cheney, and whether totally factual or not, the storyline is as spellbinding as the casts' performance.

The unique structure of the film, the way the story is laid out from start to finish, done flawlessly only the way Adam McKay can do it. Of course it is a satirical biopic from McKay, so there are plenty hilariously crafted moments. But there's also excellent drama, very informative but as with The Big Short, this script is also a lot of fun, careful not to throw information at the audience in a boring way. \n\nLet's talk about the man of the hour here, Christian Bale. Another complete transformation from him, he absolutely loses himself in this role and it's amazing to see. Everything from the hair and makeup, to the raw essence and seriousness of Dick Cheney that he perfectly captures, this is another stunning performance by Christian Bale. There's such a great task here for Bale, with the film spanning from the 1960s Nixon Administration, Cheney's career as Congressman in the 1970s, CEO of Halliburton during the Clinton Administration, into the September 11th attacks and the War on Terror. Once again, Bale chose to change his weight during principal photography to match these different eras of Dick Cheney's life, instead of using prosthetics. Amy Adams as Lynne Cheney is absolutely fantastic; the two actors share an amazing Shakespearean scene I don't want to spoil, but it is hilarious! Sam Rockwell as George W. Bush is fine, but for me, not Best Supporting Actor-worthy this time around. To my surprise, Tyler Perry as Colin Powell gave a much stronger supporting performance which really isn't being talked about. I say definitely give this one a shot, if not for the history lesson, then at least for Bale's transformation.",

He even pokes fun at this in the mid-credits scene by throwing in a gag about how Trump supporters would hate the film and having the conservative in the panel attack a liberal panelist in the focus group. I guess the director thought if he was the first to make the self-deprecating joke that everyone would just laugh it off and forget about it. \n\nThis movie reels you in to get you interested and trusting, and then tells you what you should believe in the end. When Bale (as Cheney) broke the fourth wall and addressed the audience directly about how he had to be ruthless in order to protect America, an older woman next to me in the theater said \"evil asshole\" out loud, as if Dick Cheney actually said those words.\n\nThe film mixes fact with opinion and hearsay, but presents itself as fact.

Steve Carell is especially good as Donald Rumsfeld.\n\nThe narrative is told much in the same style as McKay's The Big Short, but frankly not done as well, and tonally not really appropriate for this story. The movie shows events from Dick Cheney's life before he was VP--failing out of Yale, becoming a downwardly mobile drunk, cleaning up his act, graduating from State U, interning with Rumsfeld, working in the Nixon, then Ford White House. While interesting, McKay doesn't quite connect the dots. We don't ever really learn what makes Dick Cheney tick. We don't learn anything we didn't already know about him.\n\nI find it interesting Hollywood seems to have come to a consensus Republicans are evil, while Democrats are basically good. While I went in knowing this would be a one-sided picture (I don't really think there are two sides to Dick Cheney), I'm not sure it's fair to place all of America's current ills at Cheney's feet. So what was the point of this movie? Was it to demonstrate the dangers of allowing a cynical opportunist into the White House? (Is there an obvious parallel I'm missing here?)",

            "content": "Christian Bale has transformed MANY times for a movie--lost weight for \"The Machinist\" put it back on for \"Batman Begins\", then there is Patrick Bateman from \"American Psycho\" and of course when he played the little boy Jim in Steven Spielberg's classic \"Empire of the Sun\". The guy is an ACTOR. This is his very best role, I think. I don't think he transforms for other movies like he does for this one. And, as the picture moves on, he becomes more and more Dick Cheney, it is brilliant to watch and worth the price of the ticket just to see him do it. \nIn contrast to this \"Tour de Force\" of a performance, this is LESS a STORY and more of a DOCU-DRAMA based on LIBERAL assumptions and attacks that were all to common from the left-wing media during Bush's administration. Big on assumptions, but not on FACTS. The film even warns you of this at the very beginning \"we did our fucking best\", as though that's a consolation, be it a very heavy-handed and arrogant one. The core controlling-idea of the movie seems to be that Cheney discovered there was very little oversight over the Vice President written into US law, and so he worked around that and behind that in all ways that he could. But, the film also suggests that George Bush had literally NO ROLE in his presidency AT ALL, because it was all Cheney. This, I find too crazy to actually believe. I remember those times with every liberal shill on TV shouting \"War for oil! War for oil!\" but no one was actually allowed into Iraq to harvest any of it after the fact. And, the real facts of that war, as we can see now, both in Iraq and Afghanistan were that those wars were created to feed the bottom line of the military industrial complex. A topic the News Media has refused to investigate, and one that this film only seems to lightly, ever so gently touch upon. Companies like Boeing, Raytheon, Northrup Grumman, Kellen Brown and Root, and others made a killing. And, where are all the good liberals to uncover THAT collusion?? Oh, but Cheney is a bad guy, he did this all by himself, he had no help. Yeah. Sure. Whatever. I'm not buying it. \nI loved Adam McKay's 2015 movie \"The Big Short\", but this movie seems \"short\" on story, instead employing cutaways (which distract), dark humor (which is actually funny), and liberal propaganda (which is all too obvious) in order to sell it's grand thesis. And, it comes off exactly how McKay has come off on Television in recent years: Smug, Arrogant, Dismissive, Devoid of Relevant Facts, and Bloated. Yes, I just said he was fat, just like his movie. You can cut 30 minutes out of this screed, and it's the same \"liberal argument\" as we started out with in 2006. \nIf you are fan of Bale, watch it for his transformation. If you are expecting a good story, wait for it on Home Video. It'll be a \"Streaming\" pile of horse shit.",

More people need to know about the war criminal that is Dick Cheney. The problem with this movie is that it can\u2019t function as a proper drama and a good movie, and is at best a heavily biased documentary. The best movies in this genre are the ones that leave you thinking and reflecting, with the nuances and proper dramatic dialogue that provide an objectivity to the story and leave the audience to decide for themselves what is right and what is wrong. This movie doesn\u2019t do that. It instead talks at you for over two hours like a script derived completely from a Wikipedia article. Expository dialogue is good in small doses, but this movie uses it every five minutes, which completely takes me out of it and leaves me a bit bored. The Big Short worked so well because it could function as a drama and a captivating movie, even with scenes of expository dialogue. To make matters worse, the movie explicitly tells you how bad of a person Cheney is. Now, I personally think he is, but a movie about Hitler doesn\u2019t explicitly tell you that he was a bad person; his actions speak for themselves (he\u2019s not as bad as Hitler but you get my point). Case and point: we don\u2019t need a scene of Cheney talking to his wife from Macbeth to see the symbolism of someone corrupted by power. Worst of all, it gave me no reason to care about what was happening. It didn\u2019t inspire me and mostly just reaffirmed my belief that Cheney is a bad guy. There was a lot of potential for this movie and that\u2019s why I was so disappointed by it. I was imagining this movie being the call to action for voters everywhere, but it left me kinda bored. I\u2019ll give it a 2.5 for the acting.",

But ultimately it fails to come together as a movie or as a story at all, jumping around from anecdote to anecdote, so many cutaways it felt like a family guy episode, and then ending abruptly without seeming to have made any point one way or another. It didn\u2019t humanize or dimensionalize him or the events surrounding his life, it just regurgitates the facts in a fun way. The tone is also an issue because it will go from straight comedy to a dramatic shot of innocent civilians in Afghanistan getting blown to pieces. At the end, I\u2019m still not sure whether we are meant to be awed by Cheney\u2019s frank underwood-esque machinations or horrified by them.

Tons of people appreciate and respect this provocatively profound polemic...and I feel the current rating is not reflecting that. We know what sort of trolls, acolytes are giving this film bad ratings.\n\nThis film explores the unitary executive theory being exploited and abused more so than any other feature film in American history ( excluding documentaries). \n\nVice is didactic, intelligent, and deeply unsettling because it analyzes some hardcore truths. Christian Bales give the best performance of his career. Amy Adams also gives a masterclass sensational display of acting. The entire ensemble was impressive. Adam McKay is one of the most prolific directors of our time and I hope he receives an Oscar nomination for directing and writing. Vice has more substance and complexity than 80% of the acclaimed movies released in 2018. It would probably take numerous analytical essays for me to properly dissect the movie with adequacy. \n\nThis is an incredible film.

            "content": "Fascinating in all its inhumanity.\n\nAdam McKay's political biopic Vice (2018) is not as humorous as you might expect, but rather a damning testament to the pervasive effect Vice President Dick Cheney has had on American politics over the course of his lengthy career. Vice proposes the idea that Cheney had planned his political ascension to power long before he ever worked alongside President George W. Bush. I was initially worried that Vice might glorify or sympathize with Cheney, but McKay put my fears to rest. Vice depicts Cheney in a very clear and unflattering light as the most manipulative man to ever step foot into U.S. politics.\n\nMcKay's direction is steady for dramatic scenes, while erratic for the transitions and comedic moments. This is both riveting and keeps you on your feet while watching Vice and also got on my nerves. The direction is simultaneously impressive and annoying. The editing in particular is so interesting in how documentary footage and pictures are spliced in with the reenactments from the cast. This is very visually stimulating and kept me engaged throughout Vice as we see the consequences of Cheney's actions and choices.\n\nI do think most audiences will be confused by these editing choices as the stylistic choices can feel jarring, especially since the story is being told out of chronological order. Time skips around to get to what McKay wants you to understand about Cheney rather than just tell his life story.\n\nThe score is really beautiful and gives Vice a serious tone and a thrilling ambiance to set the mood down a dark path. The atrocities committed and ordered by Dick Cheney are set to gorgeous orchestration and that somehow fits Cheney's entire vibe aptly.\n\nChristian Bale transforms himself into the fat monster that is Dick Cheney. Bale unquestioningly imitates Cheney's vocal quality, slow speed, and biting tongue that Cheney speak with always. His mannerisms seem entirely Cheney's and not his own. Vice is a powerhouse performance of Bale becoming a loathsome man.\n\nAmy Adams is perfect as Lynne Cheney. Adams takes on her strong specific voice and powerful tone. Adams does not shy away from portraying Lynne as ambitious, callous, and tough as it seems likely that she was exactly all that and more.\n\nSteve Carell is hilarious and ghastly as Donald Rumsfeld. Sam Rockwell is hilarious and accurate as the oblivious idiotic puppet that was George W. Bush. Rockwell is great opposite Cheney in each scene, but McKay underused Rockwell certainly.\n\nOverall, Vice will be remembered for an accurate portrayal with its unorthodox style of presentation. Using Jesse Plemons as a narrator was interesting for context and perspective too. Vice is absolutely intriguing and fascinating for all its unique stylized choices. Not all work, but I found Vice riveting all the same.",

Bush (Sam Rockwell) where Cheney redefined the VP role as a defacto second president. This is the story of his 60 years shaping the annuls of political power.\n\nIf you have one reason to watch Vice, it's the staggering performance by Bale (Hostiles). As is custom, the man completely transforms himself into his subject, gaining weight, building muscle in his neck to simulate the Cheney shoulder hunch, and going unrecognizable in startling older age makeup. He doesn't just look the spitting image of Dick Cheney but he sounds like him too, exhibiting his cadences and mannerisms, and fully inhabiting the man every second he's onscreen. It's a compelling, captivating turn that ranks up there with Bale's best. He's beyond great but strangely nobody else is. Amy Adams (Arrival) plays Lynne Cheney, Dick's wife and shrewd political partner, and her worst acting moment is her introductory scene where she lays into the young Cheney. It's like an audition where the actor is hitting the wrong notes too strongly. Adams regains herself as the film carries on but never has a standout scene. Nobody else other than Bale is given the material to stand out. Rockwell (Three Billboards) and Carell (Beautiful Boy) are enjoyable and aided by impressive makeup, especially old Rumsfeld, but they're given one note to play. Their roles become more impression than performance and both men drop out of the movie for long periods of time. The next best actor might by Tyler Perry (Gone Girl) as Colin Powell, and maybe that's because Perry is used to brokering nonsense with his own array of nonsensical characters. He's already the weary adult.\n\nThe meta interludes and fourth wall breaks that helped The Big Short succeed conversely are part of the problem with Vice. Most Americans know a decent amount about the Iraq War and its documented fallout, so there's less need to have celebrities interject and explain complex scenarios and institutions (the absence of Margot Robbie in a bubble bath will always be felt). The narration by Jesse Plemons (Game Night) doesn't feel necessary, and his ordinary identity becomes a guessing game for most of the film, trying to link him with Cheney. I was thinking he would be an Iraq War soldier and get killed later on, that way establishing a stand-in for the thousands of men and women who are no longer walking this Earth as a direct result of Cheney's misguided action. Nope. When his identity is finally revealed you'll go, \"Oh,\" and that's it. Because he wasn't really a character, he was a narrative device and one that didn't stand for anything larger. The visual metaphors can also be very, very obvious. There are consistent cuts to Cheney fly-fishing in a river, meant to evoke him luring others into his desired machinations. Even the end credits feature fly-fishing imagery, in case you had forgotten about this enduring metaphor. The conclusion literally involves a heart being removed and the sequence cut along a more figurative betrayal, and you can feel McKay vigorously pointing at the screen and yelling, \"See, it's because he's heartless, get it? Do you get it?\" We get it. The documentary-style and comedic techniques that allowed The Big Short to be as entertaining and accessible, and one of the best films of 2015, are paradoxically the things that seem at odds with Vice.\n\nThe meta breaks are meant to provide a degree of comedy to the picture, which is generally absent comedy otherwise, unless you count the rise of Cheney's reign as the darkest of comedies. I suppose Cheney's nonchalant recognition of his heart attacks (he's had five) could be a potential comedic lifeline if you're being generous. One second we're told people don't speak in Shakespearean soliloquies in real life, and the next second the Cheneys are talking in Shakespearean verse. When it looks like the Cheneys will drop out of public office to spare their gay daughter Mary (Alison Pill) the inevitable storm of harassment, the movie has a fake-out end credit sequence to sum up their hypothetical lives. To demonstrate Cheney's knack for making the most ridiculous statement sound statesmen, he recommends that the Oval Office team put miniature beards on a part of their anatomy and perform an adult puppet show, which draws solemn nods of approval from the others. It's a joke that feels too glib, like the intended point is being lost by the lewd nature of the comedic aside. The only meta aspect that feels earned is the final one, where Cheney turns to the camera and directly addresses the audience, acknowledging he can feel their contempt but refuses to apologize for his actions in order to keep people safe. Because he's having the final say, because he's offering a rebuff to his movie, it feels more earned and fitting, and it would have had even more power if it were the only break in the movie rather than the last. It's hard to call this a comedy; it's more an incredulous indictment looking for its mob.\n\nI honestly think a straightforward biopic might have been the better route for Cheney. The first half of the film is more interesting and successful because it is the more illuminating half. I never knew that Lynne Cheney's father likely killed her mother. That's a pretty bold charge on behalf of the filmmakers. The early Cheney years are the moments the majority of Americans don't know about, whereas the later years have been well documented by a slew of hard-hitting documentaries, books, and journalistic exposes. There are whole movies about topics like the Valerie Plame leaking (Fair Game), the mounting mistakes after the invasion of Iraq (No End in Sight), the administration's policy on torture (Taxi to the Dark Side, Standard Operating Procedure), the drumbeat to the war and snuffing out of critical journalism (Shock and Awe, Lions for Lambs), the missing WMDs (Green Zone, Body of Lies), the Bush deferment memos (Truth), the long-term consequences for those servicemen who survive (The Hurt Locker, The Messenger, Stop-Loss, Last Flag Flying, In the Valley of Elah, American Sniper, Thank You For Your Service) and anything that Michael Moore sets his sights on. This list is not exhaustive by any means. Because of that the film seems to become a rudimentary montage once the Iraq War kicks off, sprinting through the rest as an intended tableau of hubris as Cheney's star and influence falls. I would rather have learned more about Cheney's early years in the Nixon, Ford, and H.W. Bush administrations and gleaned more personal insights into the man before he becomes this shadowy, mythic figure that seems downright Machiavellian in his control of government. It's interesting to watch Cheney and his cohorts plot their unchecked executive power behind the back of President Bush, but then what?\n\nIt's the \"then what?\" question I keep revisiting with McKay's film, trying to figure out the larger intended message, themes, and dire warnings. I feel like because of the expanse of time covered, and the meta quirks applied, that the film too often feels like it's just scratching the surface of Cheney, providing a slight gloss to a political caricature. The biggest takeaway is the slippery slope of the \"unitary executive theory,\" a term you'll hear often, that basically follows Nixon's own words: \"If the president does it, it's not illegal.\" This questionable interpretation of Article II of the Constitution gives the president powers that approach a monarch, which seems antithetical the Founders' intents. McKay warns that any president could take advantage of this theory to do whatever he or she (sad trombone noise... sigh) desires. This is clearly meant to draw a line right to President Trump, but it's not like the 45th president needs sketchy legal cover to do his misdeeds. The idea that the Justice Department memos would be a lurking danger is quaint. A bad man with power is not going to look for the rules to allow him or her to break them. The idea that a president could be above the law is also a legally specious argument and one I don't believe our courts would readily back, even with the \"unitary executive theory\" (at least I hope so). With that in mind, Vice becomes a cautionary tale about the expenditure of power but lacks the adequate follow-through.\n\nVice is a tricky biopic for a tricky subject and I wonder if it would have worked better being stripped of its prankster, meta interjections and tricks. It's a condemnation of Dick Cheney but it doesn't feel like it goes far enough if McKay's eventual thesis is that the current world problems began, or were grossly exacerbated, by the actions of Cheney. Climate change warnings going unheeded, ISIS formations going ignored, the generational consequences for unsettling the Middle East, and laying the foundation for an authoritarian strongman to be an acceptable political position for millions of Americans. These charges are clearly intended to be a denunciation of Cheney's legacy, but the end results play out somewhat differently, like a slap on the wrist. I think Dick Cheney could even watch this movie and nod in appreciation. That seems like a mistake. McKay is still a talented writer and filmmaker that knows how to keep his movie flowing and entertaining, buoyed by an outstanding performance from Bale. It's a movie with great components but seems to clumsily get in its own way with its presentation. If you're going to expose Dick Cheney as a heinous manipulator of power that has wrecked havoc for billions, then maybe you don't want to dilute your message.\n\nNate's Grade: B-",

            "content": "Adam McKay's Vice is a scatterbrain slingshot at the Vice President of Dick Cheney, tracing the ethos of its own caricatured, straw-man creation. By previously focusing on a concern for suffering, The Big Short masked McKay's lack of interest in ideological reasoning. Comparatively, Vice is motivated not by concern but by sheer hatred. Its rage-induced howl distorts its train of thought into an aimless assault on an amalgam of conservative iconography (from Reagan and Scalia to the Heritage Foundation and Fox News).\n\nRegardless of one's political position, liberalism and conservatism both come from a honorable tradition rooted in a desire to address human concerns (albeit in different ways under different preconceptions of existence). This unutterable notion (rendered as such by modern passions) is rejected in the prevailing belief that one's ideological opposite is motivated by an intrinsic desire to hurt others (as shown with the characters of Vice conversing as if harm of innocence is the first priority of their business). While malicious intent can clearly be found among those in both ideological camps, one must first understand principles before maliciousness can be identified as a differentiating exacting motivation separate from principle.\n\nMcKay's analysis of Dick Cheney cannot make that differentiation with the evidence being the hysterical laugh by Donald Rumsfeld to Dick Cheney's inquiry to their actual beliefs being uniformly associated with anyone having anything to do with conservative politics. This causes its satire to sink under its own weight while also depriving a wider audience of the needed critiques of the Bush/Cheney era iteration of conservatism and Republican Party politics. As McKay's sneering muckraking veers into speculative distortions steeped in disdain rather than hard facts, he exposes his ignorance to the conservative rebuke of the Bush/Cheney era iteration by the Trump era's populist isolationism. As such, McKay's film is a frenzied sermon to the unhinged converted who quite interestingly didn't see much to laugh about in the theater in large part due to the fact that given McKay's premises, why would this ever be a laughing matter?\n\nThe unfiltered, jittery narrative form of Vice may find some center in Christian Bale's calculated grotesquery and dramatic reprieve from Steve Carell's foolhardiness but is too loathing of its subject to understand it well enough to realize its totality. Rather than the expansive conversation that The Big Short was, Vice is the Vice Presidential companion to W. if Oliver Stone had a tenth of the creative mastery he had when similarly crafted his distorted revisionist tale JFK. In any event, always remember that McKay's emotion is the enemy of his truth.",

It is a little slower paced of a movie, but the way he frames every scene has such gusto that you can't take your eyes off the screen.\n\nOther than the brilliant script the main thing to note in this movie is the perfect casting. Christian Bale and Amy Adams teaming up again, this time as Dick and Lynne Cheney further prove they should team up in every movie together. Christian Bale is so believable as Dick Cheney that you suddenly forget that you are even watching Bale at all. Then you have Steve Carell as Donald Rumsfeld, Sam Rockwell as George W. Bush, Tyler Perry as Colin Powell, Naomi Watts, Lily Rabe, Jesse Plemons (in a role that I did NOT see coming), and plenty more.\n\nThere is a fantastic scene between Lynne and Dick where Plemons' character narrating notes - that we wouldn't know what they actually would have said in this certain moment, but he images it would be something quite Shakespearian. Then Lynne and Dick start talking like they are in Macbeth. Their chemistry is just fantastic and you get to see how much Lynne stepped up, and her ambitions and reservations with going into this political world.\n\nAs much as this movie paints Cheney as a villain, McKay still gave him depth and compassionate moments, and showing all of his health troubles. You really see how this man became the most powerful VP that we have ever had in the history of the U.S. Presidency and how scary that is because it is all true. We have lived it.\n\nThis movie is definitely not for everyone but I really enjoyed it. There is a funny after credits scene that shows how divided our country is, and the quote above is exactly what you should be asking yourself at the end of the movie. So, what do we believe?",

            "content": "Doing what is right is boring. Following the rules is boring. Doing what is wrong is entertaining. Bending and breaking the rules is amusing. Movies should not be made about politicians, but given most politicians don't do the right thing rather often and tend to break and bend the rules to fit their own needs and agenda as frequently as they see fit it is no surprise there are plenty of television shows and movies based around and on political figures. There is a brief scene in Adam McKay's latest film, Vice, based around the life of Vice President Dick Cheney where he is teaching one of his daughter's how to fish and she asks if the trick of baiting the fish with a live worm is right or wrong-you know, morally. Cheney replies that, \"It's not right or wrong, it's just fishing.\" His daughter admits to not wanting to hurt the worm, but her father summarizes his justification for the sport by stating, \"You find out what they want and you use it to catch them. The family gets to eat.\" It is with this perspective that Cheney seemed to approach his political career as well-it also exemplifies how every single line and aspect of McKay's film is integral to the portrait the writer and filmmaker is painting. \"It's not right or wrong, it's just what needs to be done.\" What McKay is really exploring through Vice though, is this idea of how does a man go on to become who he is? The film describes life as being a series of events that contain certain moments that are so delicate, that they are akin to a stack of teacups with a saucer in between each where-at any moment-one could fall in any direction and change the course of the future forever. Unfortunately, there's no way to know the future and which way things will fall, but while McKay is keen to note that Cheney more or less fell into the roles he would eventually allow to define the purpose of his life largely due to the involvement of his wife, what he seems particularly interested in dissecting is how Cheney came to view the job of serving the country and how he interpreted that responsibility as it becomes very clear that Cheney and his staff were experts at interpreting things strictly in the way they wanted and in what would benefit their cause best. What McKay is truly attempting to do is bring about a case concerning how Cheney had his hands in so many pies, either for reasons of his own agenda or for what he truly thought was best for the country (it's hard to tell from one issue to the next), and that the result of these meddling's effectively changed the course of history. McKay wants the viewer to not only read that tagline that could easily be misconstrued as a piece of hyperbole and understand it, but to grasp it and take to heart; to truly understand the ramifications of this single man's actions in determining the fate of millions upon millions of other people's lives.\n\nread the whole review at www.reviewsfromabed.com",

Great acting, especially by Bale. Carell is excellent. Adams is great. The score is fantastic. The structure yields many wonderful surprises. How RT critics could not pretty much all love this film is shocking. If someone said it had a 99 percent rating, I would never question it. The film contains some of the most creative and ground-breaking moments I've ever seen. I don't want to spoil anything, but just go see for yourself. I had not wanted to see this at first, but I'm glad I did. I learned so much I never knew. It's a must see for anyone interested in politics and the state of our world today.",

            "content": "Vice advertises based on a true story or trying as best as they could to pull back the veil on a notoriously private man. Dick Cheney is portrayed here with Christian Bale donning his look and assuming the clipped, monotone way of speaking. Amy Adams plays the driving force of this film as Lynn Cheney. Sam Rockwell performs his best George W. Bush impersonation.\n \nThere is a certain wonder I had about the reality of the movie's claims when you know how closed off Dick Cheney could be to the media. You will find an entertaining piece on his life and triumphs while curiously pondering whether he actually did these things. There are many claims in this film and it may be a situation where we never know. However, Bale completely becomes Cheney and ceases to be Bale in this picture. The makeup does not do justice to what he brings to the character with his mannerisms and clipped way of speaking.\n\nAmy Adams is unquestionably tied to his success as Dick seems to wander aimlessly without her anchoring him. Sam Rockwell is the perfect George W making you believe he knew the man himself to portray him so well. George W. Bush gets a reputation for being a stooge and he is portrayed as such despite evidence to the contrary. Again, the filmmakers did admit they may have taken liberties with the story.\n \nThere are many moments of brilliance sprinkled in this movie such as a Shakespearean dialogue between Dick and Lynn. This was one of the best moments I have seen in a movie showing the range of the two actors and the talent of the director to write such a scene. I had prior knowledge of this scene otherwise it would be easy to believe this was actually written by Shakespeare at one point. Other moments include visual metaphors where you may miss them if you blinked.\n \nDespite the moments of brilliance, the director can sometimes get too fascinated with his own intelligence. Sometimes, scenes are introduced which are more of a distraction than serving to enhance the story. I felt he did not appreciate the ability of the audience to pick up on the finer workings of politics and he uses creative techniques to drive it home although we already perceived what was going on.\n \nI loved a lot of his decisions and there were ideas I have never seen in a movie before but he included too many deviations in this film. I feel his previous movie was subtler in the message and had the right mix of his creative flourishes. There were times I was annoyed and wanted him to get back to the story. His creativity is impressive but needed to be reeled in some spots in the movie because they did not hit the notes he was expecting.\n\nA problem with this movie is the handling of Dick Cheney by pushing so hard on making him seem a bad man. It is true he performed a lot of heinous acts and probably a lot more actions we will never know about. There was not much balance to his story making him utterly unlikable. Not all characters have to be likable but they should also be given more balance. More focus regarding if he was good or bad would make the movie a more interesting take. My personal preference is the grey areas and the audience is allowed more freedom to decide on the morality of a character but that's my interest.\nVice is still a well made film posing more questions than it answers about a mystery of a man. The director clearly has a talent for simplifying complex subjects in innovative and entertaining ways. I looked forward to this movie given the cast and the previous effort by Adam McKay was brilliant. Where I believe he lost his way with this film was not trusting the intelligence of the audience and using the movie as more of a blunt instrument to hammer home the damage Dick Cheney had done. I was still enlightened and was thoroughly entertained watching Bale assume a devilish charm playing this oft disliked vice president. There was a lot of brilliance in this picture but the message was not as streamlined as I would like. Writing and the acting make this film worth watching and I enjoyed being challenged in a way most films shy away from.",

This film is interesting all the way through and the comedic edge it has makes it entertaining to watch. McKay utilizes the same style he used for 2015's \"The Big Short\" and for the most part, it works for this story. The actors involved all do an amazing job and Christian Bale has made the best actor race even more heated. His portrayal of Dick Cheney is riveting, unsettling, and unforgettable. The movie does choose to tell the story out of order, which at times doesn't feel necessary. I also felt the film came off as a bit one-sided here and there, but I think that is also inevitable for a film of this nature. Overall, the film is a sharply written and superbly acted political commentary that has a lot to say and is unnervingly relevant.",
