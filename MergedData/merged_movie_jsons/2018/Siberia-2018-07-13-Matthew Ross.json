            "content": "My wife and I watched this at home, it was free from our public library. We like Reeves, he has been in many good movies. In this one he was also a Producer, in the DVD \"extra\" he even praised the script.Well we disagree, the script is mediocre and the execution is mediocre. It is never very clear what all is going on and who all the players are and what their motives are. Plus a couple of seemingly incongruent sex scenes are thrown in.My best guess is Reeves plays a man who deals in criminal diamond trades, has some legitimate blue diamonds and some fakes that can only be identified using a spectrometer. In Russia he has to deal with various guys who in the end seem to want him dead.So while I can't say it was a complete waste of time we certainly expected something better. The movie is flat, obscure, and dull most of the time.",

The first scenes were okay, he's gotten into trouble, he's trying to find a friend otherwise he'll be in bigger trouble..Then all of a sudden he meets a girl and he sleeps with her in no time yet by the end of the movie he is willing to sacrifice himself and risk his life in order to save her.. So he basically found a woman in a village full of men and he managed to love her to death in 3-4 days? Also, Keanu and Ana Ularu share no chemistry whatsoever. Doesn't help that the writing didn't delve deeply into their characters in order to make us feel for them. By the end of the movie, I didn't care if either one was hurt because there was no depth. If you asked me to describe who Lucas Hill was I wouldn't know..Of course there were plot holes and the whole plot was kind of weak but what annoyed me the most were the sex scenes. I wouldn't mind them if the film was branded as erotic. But this one tried so hard to provide the viewer with everything: action, romance, drama and it failed miserably.",

This film suffered an identity crisis; what is soft porn? what is a romance? was it a thriller? was it spy film? There was certainly no action or suspense. There where so many plot issues and more holes than in Swiss cheese. The cinematography was the main highlight, then the acting, and finally the directing was fairly decent, although the director should have demanded this film be edited down - especially the dragged out useless scenes to perhaps a short film. 104 mins was waaay too long for the pacing that was so ridiculously slow. The score was also annoying. As a huge fan of KR, this was a big disappointment and he should have passed on this one. A 3/10 from me only for the very few positive traits.",

After fifty minutes of romance, finally we get to see diamond related scenes again. Yet, these diamond scenes are just more excuses to have sex scenes. It just becomes quite ridiculous. The pace is slow, the story is implausible and the film just has no thrill or engagement. It is a plain bore, and does not captivate me at all. Frankly, it is quite a disappointing film.",

I could just see the movie bleeding out right before my very eyes when at 40 minutes there really wasn\u00b4t anything approaching a story, just some lame thing about green diamonds that may or may not be fake. \"I hope he doesn't have a micrometer,\" our hero states. Because what person buy tens of millions of dollars in diamonds would bother with equipment to very their purchase? This plot hole equivalent of not having cell phone coverage at a crucial moment, or finding an air duct in the back you can crawl through to escape (if this makes any sense, and it does to me).The final shootout was completely absurd on every level, most of all that it wasn't even necessary.And if the Russian woman doesn't want to perform oral sex on a gangster, she shouldn't show up uninvited to a party she has no business attending. This was such an incredibly stupid story line.I absolutely hated this movie.",

            "content": "Siberia is a benign romantic action thriller with routine action and not much romance, which is pretty much what you can usually expect from anything with Keanu Reeves, a cast of Russians, and a walk-on by Molly Ringwald. Even in a summer of forgettable losers, this one disappears without a trace.No alleged action thriller about international intrigue that stars Keanu Reeves is likely to land on anybody's A list, but Siberia doesn't even try. This time the poker-faced stoic plays an adventurer named Lucas Hill who travels to St. Petersburg (Russia, you know) to sell a cache of blue diamonds from South Africa worth 50 million dollars to the Russian mob. When he gets there, the man who is delivering the gems has disappeared, so he moves on to the snowy wastes of a mining town in Siberia to find him.Instead of action, he hooks up with a waitress in an all-night diner, gets beaten up by local toughs, and rescued by the girl. They have sex with their clothes on, he wakes up the next morning and makes French toast, and just sort of hangs around. The audience hangs around too, waiting for something to happen. Threatened with mutilation and death by both the mob and the girl's violent brothers, his brows furrow. So much for acting. Instead, the girl's brothers take him on a bear hunt. Everything is tenuous, including a performance by Keanu Reeves that borders on catatonia. Just because he stopped shaving doesn't mean he can suddenly act.After he finally removes his Calvins, Siberia has more sex scenes than any previous Keanu Reeves movie, but the girl (Romanian actress Ana Ularu) is the only one who shows any flesh. Molly Ringwald plays his wife back home in the U.S., shown in only two brief scenes via Skype and long distance cell phone. Despite his limitations, Keanu's love scenes with Ms. Ularu are the rare stretches when the film threatens to come alive. Siberia looks properly deadly (no vacation destination or travel brochures here) but the film was shot in Canada. The romance grows cold while the plot grows incoherent, but nothing works out satisfactorily, including the finale, which looks like it was pasted on in post-editing with a Post-It.Formless and meandering, Siberia is a film without much purpose or promise. The direction, by Matthew Ross, looks phoned in from a toll booth in the Ukraine. The screenplay, by Scott B. Smith, who wrote the vastly superior A Simple Plan, is incomprehensible and abbreviated. One saving grace: a lively performance by a Russian gangster named Boris (aren't they all?), played with grinning relish by Pasha D. Lychnikoff, who has put in some memorable time as assorted rapists, smugglers and white slave traders on TV shows like Law and Order SVU. Needless to say, things end badly for all concerned in Siberia.",

            "content": "Siberia is a slow-paced romantic thriller that has received a surprising number of unfair reviews. While the movie is certainly no genre highlight, it convinces with solid acting performances, a gloomy atmosphere and a realistic story.The story revolves around an American diamond merchant who travels to Saint Petersburg in Russia for a big deal. Upon arrival, his contact person has vanished and the rare blue diamonds are also gone. A local gangster boss however insists on getting these diamonds delivered as quickly as possible and gives the merchant forty-eight hours to find them. The diamond merchant wants to save his reputation and travels to the Siberian hometown of his partner. He learns that his partner attempted to double-cross another gangster boss by trying to sell fake diamonds. The diamond merchant now understands that what seemed to be a perfect deal is a dangerous situation. Even the Russian secret service starts investigating. The diamond merchant however gets unexpected help from a cosmopolite caf\u00e9 owner he falls in love with and a former South African trade partner. The diamond merchant must try to find his contact, get the deal done and cooperate with the secret service in order to leave the country alive.Siberia's main flaw is that the film is quite slow-paced before the final thirty minutes finally increase intensity.However, the movie convinces on several levels as well. Every scene has a purpose for the story. The bear hunting scene for example shows us how the caf\u00e9 owner's brother starts to trust the diamond merchant and tolerate the relationship between his sister and the mysterious foreigner. The acting performances are convincing and honest. Keanu Reeves plays a calm and experienced man which explains how he could be involved in diamond trafficking but his insecure and tender side also shows that he is despising some of his partners and longing for a fulfilling relationship. The story involves numerous interesting side characters such as an intimidating gangster boss and a cunning secret agent. The settings of the movie are splendid and vary from one of the world's most beautiful cities with Saint Petersburg to rural towns in Northeastern Siberia. The story is complex but always easy to follow thanks to its smooth pace. The ending of the movie is unconventional but realistic and certainly offers some food for thought.The more I think about this movie, the more positive elements I find. I would recommend it to patient viewers with an interest in Russian culture. If you like slow-paced Scandinavian, German and British thrillers, you might also possibly like this movie. If you expect Keanu Reeves to play a similar role to his John Wick character, you won't find it in here. If you need thrillers to be fast-paced and focused on explosive special effects, you've got it all wrong. Siberia is a gloomy thriller that stands out with its unique style nowadays and focuses on character and story development rather than impressive action scenes and baffling plot twists.",

Keanu Reeves, who starred in the film and served as producer, observed that this was \"a Romeo and Juliet\"-style film. But his character, Lucas Hill, who is swinging a major diamond deal with goons from the underworld of St. Petersburg, suddenly finds himself transplanted to Eastern Siberia, where he engages in an unorthodox, adulterous love affair with Katya, the proprietor of a caf\u00e9.It is difficult to figure out what the film artists thought they were achieving, even as they attempted to explain it in their interviews. And it was impossible to see the Romeo and Juliet saga of young love with a character in his early fifties engaged in a stormy love affair with a woman who asks him to call her by the name of his wife during their intimacies!The crime story involving the diamonds never seemed to mesh with the curious love connection of Lucas and Katya. The character of Lucas became more and more repellent, as he progressively placed Katya at risk with the diamond thugs. It was never even made clear if Lucas himself was a criminal working the black market, or if he inadvertently became enmeshed in a dangerous, untoward transaction of the diamonds and was betrayed by his partner.Somehow, the filmmakers were able to say with conviction in the bonus track that by the end of the film, Lucas finds \"redemption.\" But that was not at all what was conveyed with his constant lies to Katya and his self-destructive march into oblivion. Despite an actress with some charisma, who played the role of Katya, it was never believable that she would be languishing in an Eastern Siberian caf\u00e9 waiting for a married American diamond salesman to sweep her off her feet. And it certainly was not a tale of woe about Juliet and her Romeo!",

            "content": "Siberia (2018), starring Keanu Reeves, has several strong elements, but also several significant problems. The film is about 40% romance, 30% crime thriller and 30% moody, brooding scenes that move at a glacial pace. The romantic interest is played by Ana Ularu, who played the ruthless and remorseless assassin in Inferno (2016). Ularu is more of a chickflick heroine than a Bond girl. She's attractive in a girl-next-door sort of way, not like a fashion model or femme fatale. Feminine, but not voluptuous or statuesque. Young (32) but not so young that a romance with Keanu Reeves (53) seems scandalous. She has a look that women can admire without feeling threatened. If the role had been cast with an actress resembling a young Jane March, still 19 from her role in L'amant (The Lover) (1992), the dynamic would have been entirely different. Sammy Sanchez described Jane's look thusly, \"Jane radiantly rocks this effortless belted neutral shift with a pair of braids and a classic straw boater hat for a classic combination that is both timeless and Lolitaesque without being for lack of a better word, hobaggish.\" By contrast, Ularu's Katya is initially seen in frumpy, oversized men's work clothes and boots, although she later appears in full flash and glitter for an ugly duckling / swan transformation. The audience can instantly understand the fascination and obsession that Jane March's unnamed young girl inspired in L'amant, and Rose incited among various characters in The Color of Night (1994). By contrast, the filmmakers did everything possible to make Katya seem ordinary, unappealing and standoffish, even giving her a fianc\u00e9 and an overly protective brother with several very large friends. For Keanu's Lucas to put his marriage on the shelf, ignore his perilous circumstances and his partner's recent defalcation, defy Katya's imposing and threatening extended family and the exigency of his business in Siberia, he needs a compelling reason to find Katya more than attractive and truly fascinating. Instead, we get mildly provocative unexpected one-liners. Do you think I've never seen a penis before? If I asked you to sleep with me, would you?Perhaps this is the fate of celluloid romances in an era dominated by #MeToo, the PC Gestapo and feminazis. Characters once played by Mae West, Marilyn Monroe, Jayne Mansfield, Brigitte Bardot and Raquel Welch are considered politically incorrect. Barbarella's Jane Fonda has become an outspoken feminist. Self-anointed experts, who apparently don't consider Zulu Chief Shaka a real warrior, complain that real warriors don't dress like the Amazons in Wonder Woman (2017). Lucas is expected to fall hopelessly in love with Katya because she is a strong, independent woman, who doesn't need to dress sexy to attract men, and decides if and when she will have sex. There are several sex scenes, although most are more-or-less fully clothed, including a slightly kinky bros-before-hos scene with four participants and several casual observers. For various reasons, the romantic story never seems credible. Unfortunately, the crime thriller doesn't make any more sense than the romance. There's two MacGuffins - one real, the other fake. It's not clear who has the real one or what financial impact it has on Lucas or why the gangsters are ready to kill him and others for merchandise they haven't paid for. Understanding the plot would probably require viewing the movie about three times, but it isn't sufficiently interesting to warrant a second viewing. Performances are good, particularly by some of the supporting cast. Production design is more than adequate to make Canada look like Siberia. Some of the cinematography is quite good, while many shots are marred by reliance on jiggly-cam, which shatters the willful suspension of disbelief and constantly reminds the audience they are viewing the action through the lens of a camera. The film often drags. Motivations are unclear. Consequently, the characters are not very interesting or sympathetic.",

Quite an odd situation for sure.If the premise had simply been. Keanu meets girl, girl gets kidnapped by nasty Russians (the new movie nasties), Keanu does a martial/gun training montage, then goes in for the rescue, I would have been fine if he didn't make it after a valiant effort, but at the end of this movie I really expected Keanu to wink at the camera.Despite enjoying most of his previous outings, here we have poor pacing, poor actor engagement, poor script, unconvincing dialogue delivery, and no pay off at the end.

THERE?!It would have been so much better if the female love interest would have just been cut from the movie because, without her there is a genuinely good movie here.Basically, this movie is an enjoyable waste of time, with some great scenes splashed in there and a great ending sequence, but, in the long run, the romance and the fact that the movie doesn't give answers to the questions it poses makes this movie a tremendous waste of potential.D+",

Miserable bad people of course, bad pervert sex scenes you want to cry, people without dignity and courage, stupid and drunk. It told everything about people who write it and nothing about Siberia. \n Hollywood lately thinks it can feed audience with anything and people gonna eat it with a spoon. I am from Siberia, born and raised. There are TVs in Siberia and we can watch it and expose it for what it is. It's about portraying people disgracefully.\n The writer himself, his is from New Jersey, so he should called that movie \" New Jersey, Summit\" he obviously wrote a story about his life, nobody would have any questions then.\n I didn't feel for any of the characters. Main character played by Keanu Reaves is a coward and doesn't have a spirit, a girl in a movie came off as silly and rude, with no self respect. Other characters, i din't know what are they talking about, they thought they speak Russian. \n Scene where so called \"mafia guy\" wants to be a \"blood brothers\" in reality, simply means that both man should cut their hand palms with a knife, mixture blood during the handshake, this is how you become a blood brothers. Here was portrayed as pervert sexual act instead. From what dark imagination it come from???? \n Why it always need to be something pervert to bring people attention. What does it say about scenarist and script people. Scott B Smith, the writer should be tested by a mental health doctor before he express his demons into public. \n Language used in the movie is not Russian, it's painful to watch, faces , mannerism, clothes? I felt awkwardness for all the characters in the movie. Brainless dialogues, I don't know what nationalities people are in the movie. \n Funny thing, location itself: Mirniy town, where the most of the movie takes place is not in Siberia. It's Republic of Yakutia. DIFFERENT GEOGRAPHY PLACE. What it has to do with Siberia what so ever? Maybe the stereotypes of drunk, dirty people, that promoted in this movie. Of course, what else well paid movie producers know about other country, just that.\n It was good decoration and photo montage though. But it was spoiled when camera captured big faces saying stupid things in a close short. I didn't continue to watch it. \n Writers who made this movie, don't know nothing about this place. What it shows, their personal miserable stereotypes, maybe their own psychological problems, nothing else. Siberia is big a place with great nature, kind people with a good sense of humour and mostly well educated. There are of course exception like in the rest of the world. \n They should have chosen a different name for the movie. I understand people want to make money with fast production and want to bring attention with mysterious names. Guys, just don't follow for that. It is a low vibration movie that will give you bad emotions, if you are healthy person. \n It could have been a story with inspiring figures, such a waste.",

            "content": "Siberia seems like a missed opportunity to introduce the viewers to an emotionally involving, slow-paced, old school movie. The result is instead a dull, painfully slow, cheap mix of a thriller and romantic story without the strength for delivering in any of the two. It's an over 90 mins wait for something which is unclear, and which eventually does not happen anyhow. The diamond story starts well, but half way through becomes flat, losing emotional depth and failing to develop a sincere connection between the audience and the characters. It gets almost predictable. As for the romance, without even trying to avoid an old tired clich\u00e9, Katya is just a girl living in a remote Siberian village who falls for the foreign and starts following him around no matter what he does and how much he uses her, and whose dignity and worth as a woman reach a dreary low during a scene. The intimate scenes poorly reflect the bounding, the 'building the moment' and reciprocal trust, both Keanu Reeves and Ana Ularu highly talked about in their interviews. There is no passion between Lucas and Katya, especially from his side, and his love/obsession for her does not come through. \"...and this is a problem, I assume\" says Katya. Given that the movie is sold as romantic thriller then yes, it is! This is not John Wick and does not want to be that type of movie either, but Keanu Reeves seems to be struggling to become someone different, up to the point that he is overwhelmed by Pasha Lychnikoff when on screen together. Molly Ringwald's talent is completely wasted. Ana Ularu is an experienced actress but her performance, when she's not busy kissing and/or groaning, is arguably enhanced by that emotional rigidness Reeves is (sadly) well-known for.All in all, the film fails to deliver whatever the director, the writers and Reeves had in mind - Love story? Thriller? Romantic drama? A crafted opportunity for Reeves to test himself against intimacy, passion and emotions?1 star for the supporting cast",

When he arrives there, there's no Pyotr. Still Lucas gets in touch with the buyer Volkov who is some dangerous mobster apparently. Days go by and still no Pyotr. Lucas is told that Pyotr's brother is in some Siberian mining town so off he goes. This guy only tells him that these days some new high-tech fakes are out there indistinguishable from the real thing. In the town Lucas also meets the lovely Katya who runs a cafe. Lucas gets beat up but the locals but he and Katya get involved even though she supposed to or about to marry some guy. There is some fellow diamond guy, a South African, whom Lucas keeps calling, who eventually warns him that the FSB has his eyes on him.The day of the deal he travels back to Saint Petersburg with Katya, where somehow one blue diamond appears (right). Back in the mining town there also appeared a blue diamond, but that one was fake. Volkov accepts the sample as a gesture of good will and invites Lucas to party. Katya shows up uninvited and has to pay the price by getting involved in some kinky display of brotherhood between Lucas and Volkov.As Lucas and Katya return their their hotel, the FSB is there. They make a deal with Lucas. He has to sell the fake diamonds to Volkov and he and the girl will be spared. He accepts and by coincidence and thanks to their status as \"brothers\" Volkov takes the diamonds without thoroughly checking them. The FSB gives Lucas a ticket to leave. At the airport of course dummy changes his minds, calls the South African to buy him some time, returns to the town to see Katya and also look for Pyotr who bought some peace of land in the town. Lucas, Katya, and her brothers go looking for and find Pyotr's corpse. Then they all leave except Lucas who has to look inside the house, who knows why. By that time Volkov's guys arrive, who knows how.When Keanu isn't making kick-butt movies he's making lame movies like this or Exposed. The story as I told it isn't half as bad. But it's drawn out about 20 minutes longer than necessary. And the focus isn't so much in that story but on his relationship with Katya and her family. Which again, shouldn't be an issue, a crime thriller romance, should be doable, but not at this uninspiring pace and with this many plot holes. With movie productions becoming globalized a strange phenomenon has surfaced, that of the embarrassingly sloppy script, typical of Chinese-co-productions. Here the Chinese aren't involved as far as I know, but they might as well be. This leads to the irony that apparently for Hollywood, US audiences are more discerning, even though all movies receive global distribution, but when production is also global things start falling apart.Movies that try to box in their characters into completing some acts in face of danger are always annoying. Nothing was keeping Lucas from leaving the country when he could, from not entering the house at the end, or for that matter, not even attempting the deal once Pyotr was a no-show day after day. As if characters in movies completely lose their sense of self-preservation. In any case, add to that the unsatisfying ending and you have a movie that you leaves you very disappointed. A shame because Keanu is always likeable, Ana Ularu is a revelation and a hottie, and an old-fashioned story involving the dirty diamond business should make for a good movie. Siberia unfortunately isn't that movie.",

Unfortunately when he gets there the man who was meant to bring the diamonds is nowhere to be seen. Boris is unimpressed at being let down; Lucas promises he will have all the diamonds in two days. To this end he flies to a remote mining town in Siberia where he learns that there is a problem with the diamonds. He also meets Katya, the owner of the local caf\u00e9; the two of them soon begin an affair; something the men of the town aren't impressed with. When he returns to St Petersburg his troubles have increased and he is about to upset some very dangerous people.Having noticed that this film has less than five stars here on the IMDb I didn't expect much; perhaps those low expectations meant I enjoyed it more than if I'd expected a better film... either way I did enjoy it. The plot does move at a fairly slow pace but manages to be tense when it needs to be. Amazon described the film as 'John Wick meets Le Carr\u00e9' but anybody expecting John Wick will be sorely disappointed... a couple of drunks would never put John Wick face down in the snow needing to be saved by a woman! The only connection is that Lucas is played by Keanu Reeves. Reeves is good in the role; the rest of the cast are solid enough although I'm not sure what a Russian viewer might think as most of the Russian characters are played by people from elsewhere. The film could have done with a little trimming; we didn't need numerous sex scenes. Overall I certainly wouldn't say this is a must see but it is decent enough; certainly better than I expected.",

Well, everything and anything, the boredom came very quickly, conclusion he's just dull. Keanu Reeves (who for me is an excellent actor) unfortunately can't save the film, he is very fair and very touching.\n Ana Ularu that I discovered is unfortunately very far from equaling it, she fails to make a character who is drawing and many mistakes on his part does not help. Great lack of presence, but perhaps it is due to his career (a thin filmography) hope that it improves.990/5000\nThe film is very distant, I had no compassion (just for Lucas;)) because the expressed feelings are without depth, Matthew Cross films a lightness close to the Abbyss, no line conductive and especially that of errors, when for example Lucas arrives in the bar or work Katya, I pass you the conversation between the two men (sex and useless) but does Cross see what he films? because in the background there is a Katya that \"is big no matter what\" is shocking and it makes the film, the connections are very bad.\nIn conclusion, the love story is not one, I read a comment comparing this Romeo & Julillette, my God did you read Romeo & Julillette ... Certainly Lucas walks his melancholy, but to have a story impossible to love, it is necessary to have a love affair in short, this is not the case. The history of diamonds does not succeed either.

Anyway onto this, I saw it yesterday and I'd struggle to recall any story points if my life depended on it, which is not a good sign. There's a diamond mix up, Keanu Reeves who I'm pretty sure is nameless other than 'American' has an affair after his wife ends a Skype call, he breaks his image as John Wick and kills a dog and there's a conspiracy...I think. Now that took far too long to be worth the effort but all you need to know is there's nothing that happens, it does feel like a fill in story between Wick films that's supposed to build up the legend but fails completely. He's spends 90% of his time in Russia moving from hotel to hotel, changing his phone number and making the same call, then 'enjoying' (to say the least) his time with a random cafe worker called Katya who suddenly becomes his shadow and is in practically every scene. It culminates in Reeves finding his business partner dead and frozen and a gunfight where suddenly the clearly combat skilled American businessman offers himself to the villains essentially, standing in a clearing and getting shot in the head from behind before the credits roll. Thrilling! Utterly boring and very long sections plug the spaces between where he sits in on conversations that make jokes at him or where he stops a load of drunks making a mess but it's not worth an hour and 50 if your time, in the end being batched for me personally with the likes of 'Strangers: Prey at Night' and 'Rampage' amongst others in the truly appalling bottom end of the proverbial 2018 film ladder, skip this one",

Where he should have been aware of the old maxim \"Business is business\" and realizing too late he has been taken advantage of. Nihilism his only friend.\nAh if only... Siberia is none of those things. If only Siberia knew what it wanted to be. Neo noir? A straightforward drama masquerading as a crime thriller? A heist in the manner of Thief? It fails in the most fundamental way. It strives to be an existential drama without the underlying existentialism. Either Hamel/Scott and Ross didn't know how to convey this or were too lazy to give anything more than a slipshod effort.\nIf critics and users (here's looking at you Saban Films) were expecting John Wick Chapter 21, that's on you not Reeves who as Lucas Hill acquits himself rather nicely here.\nSiberia could have been Body Heat meets Blood Diamond set against the shadow of current Russian political climate with a bit of Thief thrown in for good measure. \nMuch has been made of sex scenes. I believe the intent was to initially show lustful convenience (what there are no other females around? She is the only woman at the bar/caf\u00e9 he frequents). If there had of been, then his attraction to her would have been more palpable. From the first tryst at her urging to a gradual deepening of Lucas' love for her. The tone never changes from the first time he meets her to the last time he sees her. The latter should have evoked feelings of poignant tenderness in say the same way as Elba's/Winslet's did in The Mountain between Us. But fails to do so.\nAlthough I knew the outcome 5 minutes into the film, (the film is constructed in such a way as to lend itself to what should be an unexpected ending) it should have resonated more than it did.\nTo appropriate Jim Morrison, Siberia is pretty good but it could have been far better than it is.",

In this Siberia, it is cold, very cold ... is like extreme cold it numbs us until we totally darken. This is not a love film, lol I read the opposite on a criticism, I said to myself Ana you do not have a heart! lol but actually the person who put 10/10 is a fan of Keanu lol so this explains that. I also like Keanu but despite his performance the film is bad, it is badly put together, when we are promised a direction finally it changes and in the end nothing has been accomplished. I'm disappointed, I do not know what the director wanted to do, but it's bad, maybe he himself did not know ... except the sex, what a pain to have to undergo so much sex scene in a story none. In general too much sex shows a great weakness in a scenario, this is also the case. One question, Why Keanu Reeves is he going to do this movie? ;)) I just said, \"It's a very big actor because living the feelings alone is very strong that\" .... at the same time it is very strong, it's still John Wick (and of course, many other very beautiful films to his credit) he lost himself in the siberia that between us is very poorly filmed too ... not had the feeling of being in Siberia.

Lucas promises Boris Volkov (Pasha D. Lychnikoff) a sample with the remaining 11 to come later. And yes, this is love story too. Okay, while we wait for John Wick 3 to come about, we have Keanu Reeves in a role we don't normally see him in. He falls in love with a pretty Katya (Ana Ularu) and we are not sure why (We can see why) as we think his marriage to his wife (Molly Ringwald) seems to be okay. But, of course, we don't know anything more about that. And we only see Molly Ringwald for about 20-seconds in the beginning. When Lucas meets with Boris to give him the one good sample he has, Boris makes a very unusual sexual proposal now that Katya is also there as she followed Lucas to that meet. Boris wants Lucas to allow Katya to orally service him and Lucas will be orally serviced by Boris' girlfriend. Boris says this is all in the context of Brotherhood between he and Lucas. These are very uncomfortable scenes. Later on the Russian FSB (former KGB) gets involved and Lucas has a decision to make or not make to save Katya's life.Notables: Rafael Petardi as Paval, who protects Boris' interests; James Grace as Vincent, who warns Lucas the FSB is looking into him regarding the diamond transactions.

Chaos seizes a relationship that there is no where to take it.\nThe thriller plot works best despite some scenes that claim to be taken from a movie by Tarantino or Guy Richie and this is not always the most appropriate because of the tone in which Siberia is treated. Cold and soulless characters like these natural scenes that are not always exceptional and show the hardness and coldness of the region.\nPredictably throughout Siberia perhaps because of the fusion of tones on the sex becomes confused and very flat.",

John Wick is so iconic now that if we have a protagonist who dresses like him, walks like him and talks like him, yet doesn't shoot like him; it will disappoint the audience. Well probably the movie was shot alongside John Wick 2 and Keanu might have put this condition on the filmmaker who had to play along.... Anyway, just watch it knowing that this is not a John Wick spin-off.Siberia is a retelling of the classic tale of a shady businessman/smuggler with not so friendly client\u00e8le. Its every bit reminiscent of 'Lord of War' and 'Blood Diamond' but is neither exciting nor as thought provoking. Only thing which absolves this movie from being a total drag is the attention to the mundane aspects of a smuggler's life. There is something so uncouth and disdainful about the protagonist and his lack of innocence is disturbing. Is this the intended effect of Siberia? Perhaps!",

No, because despite the sex scenes too generous for my taste :) it's very cold and without conviction, no echo is between Lucas and Katya.\nThe character Lucas is completely lost, and so are we.

            "review_title": "Poorly written gangster film",
            "content": "This is a movie about diamond smuggling and Keanu is a diamond appraiser and a go between. It mostly involves the Russian Mafia and a small interaction with the FSB (KGB) and the married Keanu meets a Russian girl while he travels between Russian cities and waits for his supplier & contacts.The movie is painfully slow and boring as he waits around from his AWOL contact for the diamonds. The action consists of his getting beat up and left in the cold to freeze. Heckled by the girls brothers because she took him home and they thought the worst. Sex every 5 minutes because she wants to get back at her brothers who thought the worst. They don't show any body parts. Just kinky behavior or places. And then the FSB gets into the picture and Keanu gets blackmailed and caught between them and the gangsters. The ending was really rotten' especially after suffering through a horribly slow, boring movie.The actors did their best despite a horrible script and worse directing because the director also approved the script and then made it worse. The script writer and director should limit their careers to the porn industry since that seems to be their only interest. I doubt any respectable film would hire them after this. I feel sorry for Keanu but I don't know whether this porn theme was to his taste or not. Pardon the pun.First: Film Makers need to understand that people who like a steady diet of porn or sex will be buying their movies from a porn store. Not watching movies. The focus of this movie does not appeal to anyone who would watch it. Nor would the 5 or 6 acts of sex (every 5 minutes) appeal to the porn addicts without showing any body parts but do their best to imply kinky acts and places. Porn lovers aren't interested in a story line, only sex, so why pursue this type of story line which offends both the regular audience and the porn lovers at the same time. So nobody likes it and they get nothing but bad reviews from being totally out of touch with their target audience.Second: Keanu looks terrible in a beard. I realize the actors who are straight wear beards in Hollywood so they wont get hit on as much but it looks terrible and ratty and adds 15 to 20 years to their age.Third: It was so painfully slow and boring as we watched Keanu fly back and forth between Russian cities and sit waiting at each place while the background actors have to carry the film until they give Keanu something to do, since that is how the script was written and not his fault. Then they add a Russian girl to the formula whose behavior doesn't warm her to the audience. This is the fault of the script writer and director. Not her. Then they have Keanu who allows her to be disrespected on the utmost of unforgivable levels... at which point he loses the respect of the audience... which was already hanging by a thread due to the issue of cheating on the wife.Fourth: This is truly a horrible job of script writing. The story theme was thin, Cagney corny, a subject of diamond smugglers right out of the 1940's which is of no interest to the audiences and a pitiful lack of action and plot. Plus the really rotten ending. There was less than 2 minutes of Keanu showing us his trade (out of bed). The film makers & scriptwriters need to learn to create movies that the audience likes. Not what they like. But as far as the script goes, there is no dialogue, no story beyond the diamond transaction and the Russian girl to fill the time. There is no reason Keanu should be wasting his talent on movies like this. He should get a better agent and find better movies before he loses his appeal. He also needs to shave the beard and mustache. It is quite awful and would be hard to get a decent acting job with it. Maybe another Sci-Fi film and a better writer and director.Fifth: However, the audience would have liked to have seen a movie actually made in Russia with a story about the interactions of the citizens, the gov't, the authorities and how they live and function on a personal level and the misbehavior of our CIA and Corporations taking advantage of them. And the aftereffects of their changing gov't and lifestyles... without the sex and only a brief reference to the mafia. We don't need to see another boring shootemup story again. Nor an FSB torture nor a focus on politics. It needs to be a character driven story with a character like Dobrynin with his humorous remarks to JFK and Haig.Dr Zhivago was a big hit so there is an audience for it. Telefon was also a good movie to watch as was the film SALT. Perhaps with a touch of humor like the Get Smart film and Yellow cake (Uranium).However I cannot recommend this movie to anyone. Not even for Keanu's sake. It is the movie and the script problems. Not his acting. Actors have to follow the script and the direction they are given. Clearly Keanu has a bad agent which he needs to change ASAP and stay away from sex oriented movies and gangster films.",

Vincent and Keanu, allying with other South Africans apparently, once teamed up against Lagos. This explains their friendship, I guess. Andrei also sells diamonds, but we don't see him. Samsonov is also involved in the diamond industry, and as expected, we don't see him either. All we know about him is he is \"a bad man.\" Volkov also participates in the diamond industry. A guy named Polozin has leverage over Keanu, and luckily we see him in a couple scenes.That's just the characters for the diamond industry. There are a whole lot of friends and family members from Keanu's multiple love interests.If that sounded confusing, that's because it is.

The fact that John Wick 2 came out not long ago and John Wick 3 is in the works can't help but insert bias. I know I have it. So having said I know it affected how I saw the unfolding of the movie. I'd say that if say Ryan Gosling was playing the role I would give it a higher rating because he hasn't been a one-man army in recent years (wasn't really that in Drive either). For Keanu though this is just the fate that he is going to be having for a while. I mean it was hard enough not seeing him as Neo but I got past that albeit nearly 15-19 years later (if I include both movies).",

Being a fan of anything that Keanu Reeves is in I was anxiously awaiting this movie as I knew it would be a different kind of movie for him. Mr. Reeves is a totally wonderful action star, but he is also a great actor when it comes to dark and psychological movies. This movie lived up to my expectations. This is a tragic love story between two people who are from different cultures and who have lives that they are trapped in. When they are thrown together because of a diamond deal gone awry, they develop a relationship that is both sensual, emotional and yes loving even though he is married and she is supposedly engaged. They become entangled in the Rissian mob about the diamond deal. Then things get dicey. The Russians don't play and they put these two people in a violent situation that they try to escape from. I thought the story was great. The characters were well played by Keanu and Una and their chemistry worked. They both exhibited great emotions through out the movie. Keanu's command of the Russian language was perfect. That in itself shows the work and passion he puts into every role he plays. All I can say is if your not interested in seeing a well thought out and acted movie for mature people who appreciate the noir type movie, then this movie is not for you. Of course there are a lot of CGI movies out there to hold your attention without you having to invest yourself in a thought provoking movie. I have already preordered my Blu-ray.

I don't remember her at all. you the truth, her presence on screen reach the almost to nought (that's her fault).\nThe other characters are a little more aggressive. In a film, it is not enough to explain to us that this woman is strong, if she does not live it. Boris (Pasha D. Lychnikoff) could have been convadictive, but scriptwriting weakness does not allow him. I hesitate to talk about dialogues ... probably a child wrote this scenario, blah, blah, blah that bring nothing concrete to the film. A great disappointment for me, to flee without turning around.\nI was long and I deviated a little bit from my criticism of Ana Ularu, but I thought it was important to write it, I apologize if it distresses you. Take care of yourself. Jacob",

I got bored, there are moments a little exciting put very quickly the puff drops and does not make sense.\nI do not know what Matthew Ross wanted to explain but it's not convincing, he missed the boat. There is no atmosphere, the music is beautiful, the photography too but it does not stick with the film, the photography in warm tones and the film is very cold, especially the romance, it's just a story of sexual relation and in addition Lucas (Keanu Reeves) is very cold, it is also normal because the two protagonists do not know each other. And it's not passionate, it's more a rally when you're bored, more quickly Katya (Ana Ularu) introduces herself as a woman who has big problem and the moment she asks to say the name of his wife Lucas when he orgasm, it's completely ridiculous, because the characters are not so much adrift as that. It does not work, I saw it with a friend who was also extremely disappointed.\nThe storie with the diamonds is not fascinating, and even the dialogues are very weak, really a child could write that. It's not a mature relationship, as I say flat dialogues. in terms of dialogues, they do not bring anything and when that would be deep, it's just very but very superficial.\nThe poster promised a romance but it is very far from being a romance, it is not even protagonists with a madness, something disturbing, no it is flat jsute. At the level of the actors, only Keanu Reeves gets the pin of the game, a little Pacha D. but poorly directed, besides I believe that nobody is directed. Ross's camera is not in love, we have the impression that he put his cemera and he left for a coffee and when he comes back he does not know where he is lol for me very bad director, his first film being in the same style, just a little more consistent and a little atmosphere \"black\" here we are degrees still below. We lost our time, we must not rely on the movie poster lol. I do not recommend this film unless you want in your life a big and long waste of time to see a very mediocre cinema. \nI'm not angry with Keanu Reves, I'll go see the latest John Wick, he excels :)) Yet Keanu made good film Romance but he should not be in shape where the scenario did not speak to him lol Ana Ularu can't get rid of it, it is not up to the challenge, nothing big. And the choice of the actress is a little bad because the connection isn't passed between them. I didn't know her, I saw \"inferno\" but I don't remember her in the movie (a small role I think) so it's a little his first big film so it must be indulgent, she must there are still many lessons (life) to learn for must go much, much further in the cinema.\nPacha D.Lychnikoff is an actor that I appreciate but here the role is very poorly written, even if he does with a lot of conviction \"Russian rogue\" lol, It does not work, it's too bad. The fact remains that I have a great deal of respect for him. \nI don't recommend this movie unless your life is so depressing and you want to sink further.",

This film is not slow moving, if you find this film slow chances are your attention span may be too short. The pace sets up great moments between characters in this one.Second this is a character film. Not a lot happens yet a lot happens at the same time. We see this progression through the various choices that Reeves's character was forced to make between him or compromising Katya. The Brothers scene, the part were he is forced to sell the fakes and the ending.Lastly when it comes to the plot, there is quite an interesting plot. He is selling diamonds, however he cannot find Pyotr with those diamonds, yet continues to negotiate for the sale of them regardless. It was interesting to find out where these diamonds are and if he will sell them safely without compromising himself. The character progression in the film is working in perfect unison with this plot.I am shocked at the bad reviews this film has and am worried about what types of films people want if this is considered a bad one.",

            "content": "Five production companies, one entertainment company, and one distributor had a hand in getting 2018's Siberia made. I'm no can-do Hollywood producer but I think it was worth it.Anyway, Siberia is a slow-burning and slow-churning thriller. It's similar yet antithetical to last year's The Snowman. Siberia's thrills nestle in the mind's eye and not in beatings, chases, or elaborate stunts. As something about a diamond merchant whose diamond selling deal goes sour and off the reservation, Siberia is like chic, Russian film noir with star Keanu Reeves playing a detective-free, Philip Marlowe type. Granted, Siberia could've improved on its standoff, shootout ending. It feels abrupt while portraying the Reeves persona as a protagonist afterthought (you see Keanu fending off bad dudes with a mag 10 and you salivate for more). Plus, side player Molly Ringwald who's an 80's actress icon, barely shows up in two faded scenes. Nonetheless, Siberia mostly draws you in and leaves your Basic Instinct-like psyche absorbed and content. Time to pour out a little cinematic liquor (in this case I'm talking vodka).Keanu Reeves as diamond trader Lucas Hill, sinks his teeth into a role that seems tailor made for him. Sans beating people up a la the styling of John Wick, Keanu relies on minimal talking, bleeding screen presence, and some gadgetry, physical hand movements. Keanu's Hill is in nearly every frame and you as the viewer, follow his every turn (and his many sexual trysts). Minus his work in Speed, Point Break, The Matrix, and Street Kings, this is probably my favorite performance from the guy whose name cordially means, \"cool breeze over the mountains\".Siberia's director is New York City native and Harvard graduate, Mathew Ross. His first flick titled Frank & Lola (which I have yet to see) supposedly is also of the racy, noir variety. With Siberia, Ross is manifest with his vision. He fills the screen with Siberian landscapes, various close-ups, soft-core sex scene realism, and cold, ominous background lighting. His calculated pacing along with Keanu's scruffy, roughed up stares into the camera, make Siberia work as crossfire fiction. In truth, this is not an action extravaganza or a headlong genre affair yet it sets you in motion. Would I recommend that you see Siberia with a refreshed open mind? As the Russians say, the answer would be a profound \"da\". Rating: 3 stars.",

She makes first step, offering to him, she. gives him a ride with her car, she wears his hiden diamond in a candle. He does not gift her even a soup, little with aromas, instead he ask her what she whants, he can take iniatiative , to the man, to lead.\n Very strange thing happens, when he has been asked-pushed to swing his love-friend-Katya-with the one of the businessman. Volkov just for one bjob each. Which is an act of becoming brothers, mnow they are \"blood brothers\" . Their trust asre raised, they earn confidance, but on expense of love.\n This act shows the moral, the character of Lucas - he can't defend his lovegirls. He is down on the strean of river, he does not take any atction to move up. The giuilt is always on the Pyoter - the problems with diamond is bbecause of him, the whole movie.,Lucs run from responsilility, hopin that something will phappens. Indeedd he does not run, he is sinks, regardeess of the warning of Vinsens - the South African.\n TMetaforicly Lukas lookson the women like a beautifull, \"the best you ever 3ee\"- diamonds. Katya - with taft charatucter , forward and beautifull, \"unalterable\" reminds him , associates , pull a string deep in the soul of Lucas Hill. Which. is already forgot what is love - he is only old firriend with his wife - they look squint away certain things. It is shown a little bit of their relation ship, but plenty to understand.-Lucas can't get enough from his wife\n But when he finds the love, he is timid , he keeps Katya professionally, like the same way, he does not sacriface anything for her. Can we exchange the love like a. diamond jewelyy - for a wile , let's our partner try it and then return it to us ?\n The women are not jewelas, but Lukes treats them as such, he cant fin. inner forces. to fight., to go out of the river that gooes to the waterfall-fateful. for him, He doesn't go against even once, he doesn't fight for what he whants\n Ofcourse Keanu Reeves do this movie on purpose, he build the character of lucas Hill like an opposite of Jhon Wick - who kills and fight. even. for. the puppy. left by his belovveed wife. Jhon Wick has will, Lucas Hill does'nt have ome\n The opposition of these two heroes, th two types of men is tryuly significant. Mr Reeves has proved., not once , that he is capable of self-deception in the mane of art and cinema playing roles of \"weak\"man - \"Knock, Knock\", \"The Whole Truth\". It is amazing the range of the actor., he can be super hero - Neo , or to be manfailuure - in this movie. The question is : Are the viewers wants , are they accept him like a lozer. Because, as it is known, Keanu is one of the favorities of the crowd. People loves to wattch. him.; how he fights, struggle do stun real stunt work mmostly wwithout a. double.\n Here comes the geniius move of this man. You see - your. hero, beloved actor , is in a blind alley, he is pushed , but dan't do anything. You begi start to askyourself - why he does not run, why he does'nt. shoot them, why he doesn't. do anythin for God, Please! Now you think, what I want should would do , if I mm on his place.

In fact, it is just the opposite. In this movie, just like in real life, no one is perfect.Lucas Hill, played by Keanu Reeves, is not some kind of superhero. He is just an ordinary man, caught in extraordinary circumstances. He makes mistakes. It happens. There is obvious chemistry between Reeves and co-star, the amazing Ana Ularu. This brings back memories of how great movies were once made. Every single character in this movie is perfectly crafted, and Katya, Pavel and Ivan are particularly outstanding.Beautifully shot, this is how movies were once made prior to the video-game/first-person shooter genre. The tension builds slowly, becomes palatable and finally explodes into a climax that neither tells you all the answers, or even explains all the questions.In real life, bear hunting in Russia has zero to do with sportsmanship. A bear is flushed from its den by dogs and surrounded by a circle of hunters who just open fire at it at near-contact distance. In the very real depiction of this in \"Siberia,\" Ivan's dog is accidentally shot by one of the drunken hunters, and Ivan's hands are shaking so badly he can't even load another cartridge in his rifle to do the right thing to put it out of its misery. The realness of this touching scene has not been seen in a movie for many many years.This is only one example of how real the director has made this movie. In actual conflict, people get hurt ... even the good guys. Bullets go through wooden walls. People fumble. Things go wrong. Bravo to the filmmakers who have made a film that credits the audience with the intelligence to enjoy how gritty and real this is.The final scene shows almost everything that happens in real-life combat: tunnel vision; loss of fine motor skills; the good guys sometimes miss and the bad guys sometimes don't. In real life combat, nothing is perfectly choreographed, and the best plans immediately fall apart the moment the bullets start flying. In real life, sometimes a cornered bear still comes out of its den with a lot of fight, even when surrounded. I have seen this film three times so far in the past two days, and have seen more and more details every time. I actually feel sorry for people who want to rate this one star and who probably have never seen an intense drama with some amazing actors who are not just there to act in front of a green screen, gather a pay cheque and hope for big opening weekend numbers.

The movie was successful enough that I went to the effort to make this review (my first in IMDB) to contrast the vehemence from so many others.

There are many Russian films that move at a slow pace like this film and take a lot of time to set a scene and explore the characters. It's a Russian director, and he has applied his style to it well. It was funny in many respects, but clearly they focused on the narrative, for example, the locals were not kidding about his jacket. He would have died walking around Siberia like that. The number of locals that seem to effortlessly speak English, despite the explanation for Anna's capability, was just wrong. Having been to these areas, there is no one that speaks English in these remote Siberian towns. St Petersburg, of course, but not out in the bush of Siberia.

The film explores (without success) Lucas's struggles to get out of a dubious situation when his contract is compromised.\nThen he meets Katya (Ana Ularu) and from then on everything spoils, that I felt that the film began to wade. I felt that the romantic tension between the two characters wasn't at the rendez-vous. The chemistry between the actors isn't great, and the scenario is not really enough to develop the first steps of their relationship. I didn't appreciate Romance because of other flaws in character development.\nWhen romance sets in, the film forgets its thriller side, it becomes a secondary plot and nothing is done to develop it. There are very tense moments, but these moments never come to nothing, because the diversions of the romantic story cool the tension.\nAt the beginning I was quite intrigued but over time, boredom and disinterestedness settled down, especially since the story of romance became much less interesting and rather simplistic, I mean that the characters don't are touched, that what you learn as you go hasn't the will to explain.\nThe performance of Keanu Reeves is correct in this film. Keanu Reeves is an excellent actor, and despite the fact that he doesn't know how to play Lucas Hill in the movie, Hill's room to grow. Because of this recurring scenario problem, Keanu Reeves doesn't have the usual presence.\nAna Ularu in her role is much further down, I have noted an incalculable number of fault, the experience is lacking. Pasha D. Lychnikoff is doing very well, but the screenplay is so far from reality and flat that it doesn't help.\nIt's a film that for the most part is confusing, Matthew Ross struggles to locate any sign of life. Management is less and Matthew Ross doesn't film anything strong, no soul in this movie.

Ana Ularu and Keanu Reeves deliver strong performances. This movie is not your typical action thriller but - as Keanu Reeves describes it in an interview - a bit of a Romeo and Juliet story - romantically tragic.",

The script and plot are so stupid and tawdry that even a school kid could have done a better job.

Although the sexual tension of the leads could have been a good thing, the erotic scenes feel forced and unnecessary. Even the double oral sex scene can feel uncomfortable. As much as you pay attention, it is difficult to understand and you have to read the synopsis to understand what the hell is going on. The script is quite weak and lacks meaning and emotion and it doesn't even have a very good direction, since the film doesn't seem to know exactly where to go. The dialogues are poor and do not explain much. The concept of traffic and the Russian mafia is good, but it is very poorly planned and poorly developed. What is applaudable is the rawness that it has and how it tries to tell something real, but sadly it does not succeed. Something that can be appreciated is the participation of Keanu Reeves, which at least gives the film some life. Unfortunately, it's a bad movie whose only advantage is having a good actor in the lead. At least the final confrontation was something more or less acceptable, but with an unsatisfying ending. In conclusion, Siberia is one of the worst Keanu Reeves movies that had an interesting plot, but was poorly made, so it's not surprising that it has so many negative comments.

Too many groups of people (the South Africans, the Spetznas gang, Boris Volkov, Andrei and Pyotr and our hero, the girl's immediate family and friends--but no real exposition explaining anything).When he left the girl in the hotel to give Boris the single blue diamond, I thought that he was going to get busted, giving Boris the fakie, and his \"girlfriend\" taking the real diamond and scramming. That would have been good. But nooo...can't have actual suspenseful writing. Instead, his girlfriend inexplicably shows up at the meet, and is forced to perform oral sex on the gangster, or else! Of course she leaves what she thought was going to be a cocaine-and-booze party as if she'd been raped. Well...nobody told you to infiltrate a black-market million dollar diamond deal, dummy! And why would a gangster interested in diamonds FORCE his seller to do such disgusting things?Anyway, there was way too much time spent on the stupid sex and relationship with this Katya woman, who already had a beau, apparently (and our hero Lucas already married, too), as well as her vulgar family and friends (all male by the way). Very little explanatory dialog on what's happening--what did the S. Africans want? Why did the Russian police (FSB) force Lucas to sell the fake diamonds to Boris? What was the point of that? They didn't even show the cops busting him. Instead, they said \"if you don't do this for us, Lucas, you know what will happen to the girl.\" What? I thought they were Russia's FBI? Instead, they act like gangsters.Then in the end we see the dead (but not frozen?) body of I guess is Pyotr, sitting in a chair, with bloody marks on his arms as if he died of hypothermia during a heroin overdose in some shack? If so, why wasn't he in his house? What was he doing in that little shack? How did Lucas find him? And why was Katya's brother so nice to him? And why did Lucas linger around, when he should have been on a plane outta there? And how did Boris's men find out the diamonds were fakes, if Boris himself told the spectrometer guy \"we trust him. Put it away\"? I guess they used it after his \"blood brother\" left?We never got to see the bad-ass Spetznas gang leader. And how did a fake diamond end up in a candle in the crappy Siberian motel? Pyotr left it there? Why? Did he expect Lucas to find it?The entire movie was a confusing stinker, and every 15 minutes it was sweaty, gritty soft-porn sex between big-toothed Katya and Lucas, and I disliked both of them: him, for cheating on his wife (explaining it as \"squinting\" at things? ) and her for falling so fast and hard for this inarticulate American diamond smuggler, when instead she had a good man (by all accounts), \"Anton\" to be with. No scene rang true or felt authentic. Terrible writing and screenplay. And Keanu's deadpan, boring delivery, where he says. Everything. So. Carefully. And. Disjointed--wears on you after a while.

The story isn't new so it's style over substance without being superficial or throwing around sparkly things.\n For 97 minutes I was watching a film I expected to linger with me and add to my list of favorites or recommend to others.\n And then, it nose dived within the span of a heart beat.\n I despise Hollywood endings. Hollywood's own ineptness is what churns out one bad vacuous movie after another.\n Foreign film is so much more honest. I'm not saying that as a pretentious film snob.\n I was prepared and hopeful to give this a 7 or 8 (to be more accurate, 7.5/10).\nIn the end, we were left with a story lacking redeeming qualities. Just 7 more minutes to make things right.\n As to others giving the film a 1/10 - because there isn't a zero - they have been betrayed and striking back.\n There is quite a lot of excellent elements and direction.\n The minimalism is a key factor.\n The filming was subtle although detailed.\nIf you do watch, watch as a student of sorts, not as the audience and take from it what you will.",

            "content": "Siberia is film making at it's best. I was quite surprised to see this film garnering negative reviews almost across the board. It seems most likely that people went into this film with John Wick on their minds, which I think is unavoidable and automatic. Even I began watching Siberia with thoughts of Wick in the back of my head. It's hard not to. However this is not John Wick or even an action film. The association with the Wick Series is apparent throughout the film. The same sets, clothing, accents, and even the main character's demeanour lends it's self to comparison. I think the association with Wick has doomed Siberia by creating a failure of expectations.Had this film been made in distance from the Wick series, it would be easier for viewers to appreciate the nuances that for me, made this film so powerful. On so many levels this film shined, in character development, in story, or how the film maker took a traditional Hollywood theme and made it their own. And it is on this last point that will make this film in hindsight a great film. It stands out from other films with the same goal in mind, to gain wealth from diamonds by providing a fresh platform that all other films seem to recycle through.The feel of the film seems to mix up past genres in small doses, a bit of Film Noir, old spy films, and Hitchcock. The interlacing of ethics and morals and choices characters are faced with creates high drama at various points through the film, and yet it is all so subtle. Even the apex of the film is hardly recognised due to the seemingly slow pace delivery, and yet watching the character's expression and acting captures the viewer in that moment of anguish and anxiety.The ending sequences are full of promise and that promise remains until the very end. While one's optimism might lead you to think of the old west gunfighter on a dusty street, the arch of the moment steals the viewer's momentum. It doesn't end with a bang as one would expect from characters we are invested in, or the star power of Mr. Reeves, but instead with a whimper. Yet it is realistic to the end.For those willing to look past the John Wick comparison, the viewer is treated to a well honed story that could have easily become convoluted. That the story escaped so many typical tricks and cliches of film making deserves to be applauded. I was left in the end, feeling invested in the two main characters, and empathised with their journey, and also feelings like I have watched something fresh and yet so old and time honoured.",

It took up too much of a film that might have been better.Lucas' dialogue was the pits to say the least. He even SOUNDED like John Wick in his lines. He was supposed to speak and understand Russian but too many times he just stared at the other men and said nothing or just shook his head.

            "content": "This isn't a balls to the wall action thriller a la John Wick. It's not a steamy romance movie, either. To me, it's a meditation on how quickly things can go wrong. How little of life is in our control, and how sometimes you just are swept up in things without any time to really understand.There are certainly elements of both action and romance, of course. Keanu Reeves plays Lucas, a humble salesman dealing with a particularly large diamond deal. Things go wrong from the very beginning, and we follow Keanu as he searches for a missing business partner who has already set a string of events in motion which were (to me) always inescapable.What feels initially like a straightforward gangster diamond deal flick then takes a sudden turn when Lucas crosses paths with a beautiful bar owner. What is initially a run of the mill episode of a salesman husband cheating on the road turns into something surprising for both viewer and Lucas.After some time exploring this strange and beautiful relationship Lucas has stumbled across we return to the tale of diamonds, and things continue to get worse and worse here. Once again, it seems to me that this is all largely out of Lucas's control. Keanu does an excellent job of portraying someone who is trying hard to make the best of the terrible hand he's been dealt.Eventually, Lucas has to make a tough decision. In some sense, we see Keanu make a much more difficult and masculine decision than he ever did in John Wick. He quietly shoulders all the responsibility for things beyond his control, likely saving the lives of the two women who meant something to him.The important thing to me with this movie is that it's almost completely believable. In real life things are messy, the protagonist isn't always a hero, but he/she probably does mostly try to do right. Most importantly, in real life things don't always end in a satisfying way. Sometimes they just end, and it's up to you to find your own meaning in the randomness of the experience.",

Reeves is his usual minimalistic self, a technique which he owns perfectly. And Ularu gives a stellar performance exercising her brilliant acting chops in all its splendor for all to see! If you want to see something thats not run of the mill, give Siberia a shot. You won't be disappointed !

She is the very reason I would rate anymore than a single star. I really wish her the best in her career, and hope she continues to blossom.The bad news is a handful. To begin with, Keanu's acting was typical of his stoic, nonchalant, conserved style - yet it becomes deeply problematic in the setting of this film. The decision of casting him as Lucas is puzzling. Lucas (Keanu's character) is a multi-faced, convoluted, at times a victim of cowardice yet simultaneously a courageous man capable of commendable acts of heroism. This requires an extremely subtle, sensuous portrayal that does not fit Keanu's acting profile at all. One could immediately recognize the disparity between personas in the numerous sex scenes between him and Ana - metaphorically, with her presence Keanu almost strikes as an amateur, heedless virgin who is not sure whether he should put his hands on her waist, or on her breasts. Ironically, his character Lucas, is supposed to be a 51 year old, married, shrewd, successful and experienced diamond smuggler. It is just out of proportion. In an attempt to finally mobilize Keanu's talent as an action-thriller superstar, the film ends with its only shootout sequence between him and 4 Russian gangsters who aren't even clothed with body armor. Yet it is of little to no consolation to both Keanu and fans of his work, as regardless of a vaguely pathetic shoot-out near a cabin in the woods (which supposedly serves as the exhilarating coda to all the build-up and suspense), Keanu suffers a tragic death being blasted into oblivion by a smug Russian Pablo-Escobar-lookalike thug shouldering a 12-gauge shotgun. We catch one final camera shot of Keanu's dead lifeless face on the ground, which is followed by somber music and rolling credits. To that I say: What the f.Besides the troubling casting decisions of the film's male protagonist, the larger storytelling and plot is probably even more to blame in terms of its stodgy approach in narrating a potentially intriguing set of events, and the sloppy, contrived design of the larger blueprint. A few examples and comparisons could help clarify this phenomenon.In terms of the uninspired storytelling, one could take the instance in which the story fails to make much sense when Lucas's perfectly harmonious marriage (suggestive of him skype calling his wife back home as he is on business trips), is immediately followed by his seeking out of Katya at 2am in the morning and having \"hot-rodeo-sex\" right on the couch of the empty bar. Okay, perhaps one could argue it's the duality of man. Sure, then what about the other case that could be made for an earlier sequence, when 2 drunk Russian cretins decide to ambush a tipsy Lucas and as one of them lays a hand on Lucas's shoulder, Lucas responds with disquieting speed as he counters the assailant in the stomach with a well aimed uppercut? So it seems our protagonist clearly is an advanced combatant with a high level of vigilance even when drunk - yet, a sucker punch (which ended the bar-fight sequence) to Lucas's face is supposed to knock him unconscious outside in the snow for ages until the bar closes and our dear Katya discovers his seemingly lifeless body? It just doesn't make sense. The story even teases us with potentials for exciting conflicts between Lucas and rogue special forces (Spetnaz) within his conversation with an associate's brother, yet it all accumulates to nothing but disappointment and a lingering sense of profuse confusion. So perhaps this truly was just supposed to be a softcore-porn/rugged-romance thriller. If so, don't give clues/hints of no avail! If so, don't cast an action star such as Keanu!To further the already illogical storytelling, the plot is its \"blood-brother\". It seems overtly contrived in moments as various scenic settings are reminiscent of Keanu's iconic \"John Wick\" style, with lavish, eastern European ecclesiastical architecture and illegal indulgences that insinuate the degenerate socialite lifestyle. Yet on the other hand, another 50% of the film takes place in what one could only describe as a resemblance of \"Old McDonald had a farm\" except it's in Siberia. It's just as confusing for both the viewer, as it probably was for our poor Keanu who just seems terribly out of place standing in front of Katya's earthly, pastoral wooden house, while he himself sports either a Porsche or Land-rover and expensive clothes... In one moment, Keanu is singing Russian drinking songs with rural locals in the Siberian forest exchanging cheeky Russian aphorisms - the next, he is sitting in a private club of a Russian gangster and coerced into instructing Katya to suck the other mans penis in participation in some grotesque ceremony of brotherly bondage... The list continues since there is just too many totally contradicting elements one could name, and even if this is some sort of artistic literary fusion of juxtaposition, it fails to achieve harmony. Ultimately, despite its best attempts, the film fails miserably in its marriage of its cast and plot, and if anything, it again just leaves the viewer unsatisfied both ways. Neither is the action thriller that never was, nor is the memorable love affair that seemed to never be.(This review has no intention in critiquing the character, aptitude and accomplishment of any of its actors. It is merely a commentary upon the objective work as a whole!)",

            "review_title": "Siberia is a movie about relationships between people...",
            "content": "First of all, I must sincerely admit that I've been immensely thrilled about this movie since I read its short synopsis and later saw the first picture of Keanu from the set in Winnipeg, Canada, and afterwards, I became even more worked up about the fan updates, photos which many of them graciously shared on their social media. I was following all the news with meticulous attention, very carefully analyzing videos regularly recorded by people equally interested in the film plot and especially one of its cast member, thanks to whom I found out about this indie production. But for him, I'm more than sure that I would have never come across it. When I first saw a trailer, I felt even more curious and eager than before and when so many bad opinions popped up about Siberia, I felt almost obliged to share with you my own insights and impressions. I started watching the movie in the late night and was a bit afraid of what I read in most of the reviews that the movie makes you fall asleep after very first minutes of its length. It is definitely not an action-packed flick with many plot twists incessantly bumping up your emotions. It is not an artistic masterpiece or a typical romance film about two characters ideally tailored to each other. Nonetheless, it is indeed a very engaging, original, intriguing production touching some a bit psychological issues of our lives. I know there are many people, so-called film critics, who consider it as a dull, lacking emotions, action, pace, chemistry between the leading actors, soporific low-budget film. I can't agree with any of these points, I didn't feel sleepy at any time or scene when I was watching it with unchangeably interest, and enthrallment with its very Russian, enchanting music composed by Daniel Bensi and Saunder Jurriaans. I think that the movie gains a lot also thanks to wonderful exterior shots of Saint Petersburg and real Siberian woods. At the beginning of the movie, we're getting to know Keanu's character, Lucas Hill, who is supposed to meet with his working partner Pyotr in a beautiful, yet so mysterious, Russian equivalent of Rome, known from such epic, unforgettable books like \"Crime and Punishment\", \"The Idiot\" by Fyodor Dostoevsky (which, by the way, I recommend anyone to read and due to them understand how important for not only the Eastern but worldwide culture this place undoubtedly is). Lucas is a reserved, stoic guy who isn't fulfilled with his current life and uncertain business he became a part of. After landing at the airport, he instantly drives to the hotel where he and Pyotr planned to see. This trip would have been just another ordinary deal for Lucas if only his partner had appeared with diamonds for Mr. Boris Volkov exquisitely played by Russian actor Pasha Lychnikoff (\"A Good Day to Die Hard\", \"Chernobyl Diaries\"). \"Volkov isn't a good man to disappoint\", ensures Lucas when he tries to contact Pyotr who just before Hill's plane has taken off called him being evidently very jovial about the perspective of earning a solid sum of money. Unfortunately, after this scene, nothing seems to fall into place. Lucas patiently tries to look for his apparently carefree colleague in a wilderness of Siberia, in a little village situated in the middle of nowhere, where he falls into a passionate romance with a fearless woman (probably equally fearless in real life) named Katya who, as it later turns out, has a very supportive family consists of thoroughly plainspoken brothers. Their first meeting is very little romantic. Although Katya, a modest caf\u00e9 owner, seems to be intrigued by the lonely American straightaway. They differ a lot, they come from completely distinct worlds. Nevertheless, some strange, unexplainable bond connects them and later makes them two partners in crime (here we can notice some Bonnie and Clyde reference to this very unconventional couple). They found each other in difficult, definitely unfavorable circumstances, two lost souls searching for lively feeling, passion, an adventure. I can see in these characters two unsatisfied people with their repetitive lives, grey, bleak reality. Nothing vibrant, invigorating awaited Lucas. Nothing new, unusual Katya anticipated until they coincidentally decide to break the rules, the clich\u00e9d convenances which they always have to obey before. They eventually let themselves to explore something deeper, different, in a way releasing themselves from the invisible cages in which they were trapped, cages of their own limitations, faded emotions. When I first found out about Siberia, I didn't expect it to be a tragic love story. Since it is not stereotypical at all, I felt even more absorbed while watching it. I know that there are people, especially these all professional critics, who wanted to see another action, stirring film with Keanu running, shooting, wearing a bloodstained suit. John Wick was some kind of renaissance movie for our man, at least this is what journalists tend to write and, speaking honestly, I can't approve their view. Before John Wick, there were other great productions and I'm now referring to a very underrated samurai story \"47 Ronin\", a delightful comedy written by Keanu's long-time friend Stephen Hamel (who is, worth-mentioning fact, also an author of the Siberia story) and Keanu's engrossing brainchild called \"Man of Tai Chi\". Of course, non-fans, film enthusiasts could not know about all these projects, because, in fact, it was \"John Wick\" who sort of made Keanu recognizable and in the spotlight again among less well-informed folks. I believe that the negative and detractive reviews come generally from the viewers who were ready to watch Keanu beating up bad guys and being a killing machine, a man who terrifies Russians, not is petrified by them like it is in Lucas's case. I don't want to declare that Siberia is what I was hoping for because, as most of you, I really wanted to find out more about Mr. Hill's past, what brought him to become a diamond merchant, what kind of life he normally leads when he's not dealing with any business. The whole story was invented by a man who was involved in creating \"Henry's Crime\", the film I very much enjoyed and think about it as a very comforting, light comedy with some crime, romantic threads as well. The script was written by an Oscar nominee- Scott B. Smith. I know that some fans might have anticipated something huge, astounding, with a great dose of action scenes. However, I can't stand reading people's comments who can only complain about the supposed lack of emotions, boring editing, too explicit sex scenes (are they really? I'm not a big fan of film romances, but there are other movies with much braver script). Can't they detect how much effort and courage it actually took to make such film? The Mixed-genre movies aren't those which we got used to seeing, at least average viewers, usually films can be classified into one, two specific types. \"Siberia\" is a unique, exceptional film, kept in a rather indie climate. I like how they pictured Russians, pretty plausibly, and they did a great job casting real eastern actors instead of Americans ineptly attempting to impersonate Russian mentality and pretend their challenging for western performers accent. I think people should appreciate \"Siberia\" for its non-typical romantic thread, it's after all, in my genuine opinion, the movie about relationships between people- Katya's with her family, Lucas with his wife, Lucas and Katya's relation, Volkov with his \"blood-brothers\". It's a special film about finding love, not this one which we know from cute, immature Hollywood romantic comedies, in the most inconvenient circumstances, in a cold, frosty world. I can see some Romeo and Juliet reference as well-two seemingly unlike people, Katya's family influence, Russian clan who wants to dictate their female member the best way to settle down and live, and this way is far from she probably dreams of, sudden awaking of strong feelings between two lovers who descend from variant realities. People should appreciate Siberia for its idea of impossible love, for this little, unfortunately less exploited, suspense, action thread, its shooting scene which ends with a very moving, in my opinion, final, spellbinding music and, I wouldn't be myself If I didn't bring this up-Keanu's polished Russian, his distinctive coat and Canadian town Marquette which plays Russian Siberia area very convincingly. I hope sooner or later I'll be able to purchase Siberia on Blu-Ray, because I want to have it in my collection. To be honest, this indie production didn't wholeheartedly impress me, but it certainly engraved in my memory as a good, well-directed, extra-ordinary independent picture.",

            "content": "If you have ever seen one of those situations where someone famous gets pranked and everyone else apart from them know, then you will get this film. What I imagine is happening is that Reeves has been told they are making a film and he has to stand in at short notice so hasn't had time to read the script first but \"don't worry Mr Reeves we will feed you the lines as we film!\" Then they put him in the most stupid scenes which is why he spends all the film with a look that says, \"is this really going on?\". I can imagine the pranksters laughing in a room someone and saying, \"make him do this now!\".The good bits of this film - the opening titles give you the idea that you are about to watch an exciting thriller or spy movie, they really built up my hopes. They are sadly wasted on this film. Maybe one day someone will make a good thriller movie called Siberia and can reuse them.Then the movie starts and that's where it all goes downhill. Some critics have said that this film goes at a snail's pace, they are wrong, it in fact goes along at the speed of a glacier. I am not sure what sort of boring life you must have to lead if this was a thriller to you, maybe you have been in stasis but awake at the same time for a few decades. You would get more excited watching a four-hour video of two people making flatpack furniture.There is a good reason that all the main characters drink copious amounts of vodka, and I assume that it is real vodka, so that they can get through their scenes.I won't spoil the film about talking about the plod, I mean plot, but I will say that if you gave a young teenage boy the task of imagining how adults get intimate and the kind of things they would do and say at those times it would be at least half of the film.All is not lost though. Should you have someone you want revenge on, invite them over and watch the film together. You will have the pleasure of knowing that inside they are seething with rage at losing some of their precious lifespan.I won't spoil the film about talking about the plod, I mean plot, but I will say that if you gave a teenage boy the task of imagining how adults get intimate and the kind of things they would do and say at those times it would be at least half of the film.",

You then clasp each others hand mixing each others blood. Mr. Smith thinks it has something to do with BJs. One never saw Keanu using cocaine or using drugs in any other movie. Mr. Smith writes from the perspective of a hedonist. The love scenes, wooden at first, did improve. Not due to Mr. Smith's writing. The improvement can be credited to Keanu, and his co-star, Ana Ularu. Then there is the plot. Does Smith write one that gives Keanu a chance to escape through guile? No, that would have required imagination. Has Smith ever seen a \"John Wick\" film. Doubtful. Keanu kills a bar full of men with his belt. It was Scott B Smith that died in this movie.

And who, in a state of extreme twitterpation, has lost the presence of mind required to realize a booty call to cafe girl has a significantly high probability to segue into scream-till-you-sell-your-soul pain and anguish and possible permanent disfigurement.I had questions. Why did the writer bother to introduce the Reeves' character's wife? Yet fail to do a bit of gemological research for the sake of believe-ability? Why show the collective aptitude of brother's bro-gang in the first cafe scene, then again in the unnecessary and depressing hunting scene?Then I thought--this movie was filmed in Canada (mostly), it cost two million to produce and barely broke half a million at the box office. So perhaps it was (unintentionally) born to be a tax write off for investors?Better luck next time.",

This man, on first sig look \u2013 has perfe tly evaluation of jewels, but has strange ethical , scale of value when comes to talk about wemen and Love. Here we see how he, at the beginig, heas fall in love with the charmy Katya, but in away, which you can call it passiv.   She makes first step, offering to him, she. gives him a ride with her car, she wears his hiden diamond in a candle. He does not gift her even a soup, little with aromas, instead he ask her what she whants, he can  take iniatiative , to  the man, to lead.\tVery strange thing happens, when he has been asked-pushed to swing his love-friend-Katya-with the one of the businessman. Volkov just for one bjob each. Which is an act of becoming brothers, mnow they are \u201dblood brothers\u201d . Their trust asre raised, they earn confidance, but on expense of love.\tThis act shows the moral, the character of Lucas \u2013 he can`t defend his lovegirls. He is down on the strean of river, he does not take any atction to move up. The giuilt is always on the Pyoter \u2013 the problems with diamond is bbecause of him, the whole movie.,Lucs run from responsilility, hopin that something will phappens. Indeedd he does not run, he is sinks, regardeess of the warning of Vinsens \u2013 the South African.\tTMetaforicly Lukas lookson the women like a beautifull, \u201cthe best you ever 3ee\u201d- diamonds. Katya \u2013 with taft charatucter , forward and beautifull,  \u201cunalterable\u201d  reminds him , associates , pull a string deep in the soul of Lucas Hill. Which. is already forgot what is love \u2013 he is only old firriend with his wife \u2013 they look squint away certain things. It is shown a little bit of their relation ship, but plenty to understand.-Lucas can`t get enough from his wife\tBut when he finds the love, he is timid , he keeps Katya professionally, like the same way, he does not sacriface anything for her. Can we exchange the love like a. diamond jewelyy \u2013 for a wile , let`s our partner try it and then return it to us ?\tThe women are not jewelas, but Lukes treats them as such, he cant fin. inner forces. to fight., to go out of the river that gooes to the waterfall-fateful. for him, He doesn`t go against even once, he doesn`t fight for what he whants\tOfcourse Keanu Reeves do this movie on purpose, he build the character of lucas Hill like an opposite of Jhon Wick \u2013 who kills and fight. even. for. the puppy. left by his belovveed wife. Jhon Wick has will, Lucas Hill does`nt have ome\tThe opposition of these two heroes, th two types of men is tryuly significant. Mr Reeves has proved., not once , that he is capable of self-deception in the mane of art and cinema playing roles of \u201cweak\u201dman \u2013 \u201cKnock, Knock\u201d, \u201dThe Whole Truth\u201d. It is amazing the range of the actor., he can be super hero \u2013 Neo , or to be manfailuure \u2013 in this movie. The question is : Are the viewers wants , are they accept him like a lozer. Because, as it is known, Keanu is one of the favorities of the crowd. People loves to wattch. him.; how he fights, struggle do stun real stunt work mmostly wwithout a. double.\tHere comes the geniius move of this man. You see \u2013 your. hero, beloved actor , is in a blind alley, he is pushed , but dan`t do anything. You begi  start to askyourself \u2013 why he does not run, why he does`nt. shoot them, why he doesn\u2019t. do anythin for God, Please! Now you think, what I want should would do , if I mm on his place. This is it , This is the point of . Keany and dhedirector- to put you on  the place of main hero \u2013 to feel with him . To feel that you want to fight for your love. What you gonna do, if you were on my pplace , ask Keany with this movie.",

Instead it's Keanu in a more reserved and boring Wick persona venturing around a bleak Siberian environment of rich Russian mobsters and a very annoying sex crazed Russian woman that is unconvincing. The plot drags around and really is cliche as they come with stolen diamonds and blown mobster kingpin deals with utterly banal dialogue. The ending comes abruptly with no real conclusion and the film is over. While Keanu delivers his signature acting style that's servacable for the most part, there's really no reason to watch this. It's essentially John Wick on a depressing vacation without any action or excitement Obsessed with a Russian chick.",
