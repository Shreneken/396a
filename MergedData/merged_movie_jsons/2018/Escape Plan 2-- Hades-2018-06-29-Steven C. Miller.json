CGI is awful, explosions and gunfire is so fake that there are no words to describe how bad it is. There is one cool scene and that is the barfight.

            "content": "SPOILER: I really enjoyed Escape Plan. It was fun and although a little silly it was well put together well directed. Now I was surprised to see Stallone doing back to back sequels in Escape Plan 2 + 3, but if 2 is anything to go by then Stallone has slipped horribly into Straight-to-Video Hell! Which is quite apt as that's what Hades means (it was the Greek name for the underworld).So why is it so bad? - Well, firstly we start the film with characters (and actors) we've never seen before: A team on some kind of rescue mission from terrorists. Wait, what?! We don't see Stallone until 10 mins into the film. It's his team. He's the boss of a security firm in Atlanta now. But he's not the main character. Oh. The main character is Chinese actor Xiaoming Huang. No, I've never heard of him before either. Don't get me wrong, I have no doubt this actor is a big star in China. His martial arts are really good, and he has a certain presence about him. But his character here is so underwritten that you never engage with him as a character. So instead of being invested in him, you become a mere spectator of what happens to him. I'm sure Chinese money & market has a major part in his casting, but this isn't how to do it. Also featured is Cheng Tang, who (I'm sorry), is almost unintelligible in around half his scenes. But I think it's partly the director's fault. We frequently can't see him speaking as the camera is doing something strange. So you get a difficult to understand accent from a disembodied voice.So, Huang finds himself inside a new mega high-tech prison, where to achieve privileges you have to to win fights in a gladiatorial fight - for no apparent reason. Oh. This is such an old B-Movie clich\u00e9 that I can't believe they went there, but I suppose they wanted to make use of Huang's martial arts and this is how they do it. It's a bit desperate though. Meanwhile, on the outside Stallone recruits Bautista to help find Huang and another team member who's gone missing. At this point you think this might pick up, but you'd be wrong.The problem is that none of this is joined up well. You frequently are barely comprehending what is supposed to be going on. There's no real focus to the film as we cut back and forth between outside and inside the prison - which nobody knows the location of. Dialogue is frequently missed or mumbled, especially by 50 Cent, who is so bad I think they could have employed a cardboard cut-out with a robot voice and it would have been a) more intelligible and b) a better performance. Seriously, why do people keep employing him? Bautista is underused, and is just a man mountain who terms up and does things. There's no character. He's just a thing that does stuff. Stallone, obviously is trying to spin-off successful films in which he was the action hero. Now older, he can't do that stuff anymore, however, when he does a little bit of action you can't help but be impressed. Here there's a good action scene in which he and Bautista waste numerous assassins, but I really don't know what that scene was about. It just seemed to be stuffed in there for a bit of action. Another scene is a bit silly really, where he faces a man at least 30 years younger than him in fisticuffs. Dude! You're in your 70's! Stop it! It's getting embarrassing now.The special effects in the film are grossly overdone but so low grade that you wonder how they managed to use 90's technology and make them look 80's, and the prison never feels like anything but a rather bad film set. The whole film looks rather B-Movie cheap. Although the script doesn't work for all the reasons I've given above, I reserve special mention for the director, Stephen C Miller, who seems to think that erratic and inappropriate camera movements is what directing means. This film could have been watchable if Miller was not at the helm. He's dire! It's like an 8-year-old was given a camera kit and tracks. This isn't style, it's mess. Nothing about his direction works. Nothing. No thing. In all seriousness, Miller has killed what might have been just a bad film and made it a very bad film indeed. Producers! Stop employing him! He has no idea what he's doing! Nothing he does works!Please, Stallone, you are better than this. You can write really good characters and you are actually a good actor. Do some thrillers. Act your age, dude. As for Escape Plan 3: Devil's Station, at least it won't have Miller directing. John Herzfeld at least knows how to use a camera.",

I really liked the first one and thought that the cast in this one was decent. Sadly, almost nothing about it works. The script is disastrously bad. The plot and pace are all over the place, making an 85 minute movie feel long. The cinematography is horrendous. The movie is filled with neon lights that are almost headache inducing. The fight scenes are banal and are there just for the sake of it.There are Sci-Fi elements that serve little purpose and don't really fit. Oh, and Stallone and Batista are secondary characters. This would not be a problem if the leads were interesting, charismatic or well written, but they unfortunately are none of those things.I enjoy B movies. For me, everything can be forgiven if the movie is fun. But this is just boring.",

So you would think I went in expecting to see Stallone. I was wrong. A team needs a setup, I do not care about any of the characters. The lead Asian man was a nice surprise since I love martial arts movies but his character is like a walking cliche. He does martial arts, meditates etc. It feels shoehorned in to give him weight. His martial arts seem good but that leads me me to the main problem I have with this movie: they cannot keep the camera still at all. Why, oh why is it so hard to keep the camera still? Put the damn thing on a table, the constant movement(AWAY FROM THE ACTION) does not help, it ruins the coreography which seems good, just that I can't see any of it because the damn camera moves so much all over the place. I apologise for cursing but I honestly was really looking forward to this movie, being a Stallone fan but this movie I cannot recommend in any way shape or form. Stick to the first one.",

It blends suspense , thrills, action , twists and turns . it is believed that no one can ever flee from impregnable prison , except for a daring man , Ray Bresl\u00edn : a senile Silvester Stallone .

The main actors are nondescript Chinese stars who take part in regular and regularly disappointing martial arts fights which are randomly shoehorned into the story to make little thematic sense; even worse the choppy choreography renders all of them unappealing.

Stallone and Schwarzenegger headlined 2013's Escape Plan teaming up for the first time since the Expendables but moreover working together for the entire movie. Why Stallone why? Why was this movie made? What is wrong with this movie? Boring as hell, A lot of CGI, shaky cam, horrible dialogue, horrible acting, terrible music sound, Stallone isn't even in this movie.The plot makes no sense. This movie is more a sci-fi film, it has no action. The plot is pointless. Horrible shaky cam jumps up and down. When Stallone fights on the end, that is his stunt double. Stallone is far too old to fight with a younger guy. What the hell Stallone? Why did he went to make this movie? Did he do it only for the money? In this movie Stallone isn't much in it! His character Ray Breslin is useless, he does nothing. Sly is old and his character is old fat sack! Sly even him self is disappointed, I am dissappointed Sly. Hades might boast some decent star power, but there isn't a celebrity in the world who could save this bargain bin nonsense from feeling like a bootlegged ripoff of its own franchise. Not even Arnold Schwarzenegger, who faced off against Stallone in the first one, could have rescued this from abject boredom.The ending is unexplained this movie is nosence un realistic joke! I will never watch this movie again. I don't need to watch this movie in my life again. I am staying away. I am Stallone fan 4 life but this sequel? Attrocius sucks! It sucks, sucks, sucks and sucks more. Dave Bautista is wasted in this movie. The plot makes no sense, the soundtrack makes no sense. This movie is garbage waste material deserve to be in trash. Who ever is going to buy this movie on Blu-ray disc will have a bad day! Stallone's worst garbage movie he ever did, he only made it for the money.Jaime King as Abigail is in this movie replacing Amy Ryan, but we don't see the actress whole picture only half of it. 50 Cent I don't see him full lengt I only see him half. Horrible cast, horrible acting, horrible writing, horrible direction. Steven C. Miller messy blew it, you blew it Miller! This movie is really bloody messy, stay away.

            "content": "I never saw the first film, \"Escape Plan\", and only saw the sequel because it's apparently awful. How do I know this? It has made its way onto IMDB's infamous Bottom 100 List--a list of the lowest rated 100 films with at least 10,000 ratings. It now is number 97...but by the time you read this it might have changed position or might no longer be on the list.I should point out that I have little interest in most action films...particularly Sylvester Stallone's. He's made a few very good movies, but, for the most part, I just don't enjoy the sorts of pictures he makes. So why did I watch it? Well, the answer is above...it's supposed to be a horrible film and sometimes I enjoy watching one of these to see if it's really as bad as its IMDB score would indicate.Stallone is the head of some private group of 'good' mercenaries. They specialize in extricating prisoners from their evil captors around the world. As for Stallone, he is the boss and doesn't work in the field any more--and considering his age, it makes sense that he sends younger folks to run these missions. However, when one of his best men is kidnapped and sent to a 'super-duper prison', Stallone himself is going back to the field.I felt mad when the film explained why the team member was kidnapped. Why? Because if the writers had even done some BASIC research, they would have learned that the plot was impossible. Let me explain: to receive a patent for an idea or product, you need to register it. When you do so, you describe the exact formula. The film supposedly has kidnapped the team member and his family member because this family member patented a secret plan which can disable the world's computers....but that plan should all described in the patent! What they really meant is that whatever he'd developed was top secret or the like...not a patented product. My wife have has a few patents and I understand this part of the process...apparently the writers did not!What I also hated about the film is the prison the two are being kept in because it's like something out of a sci-fi movie. The prison supposedly is all automated and can rearrange and change...thus making it hard to plan on how to break into it. The idea is just dumb...let alone impossible with modern technology. It also is dumb that within this silly prison there are no holds barred fights...almost constantly. Just a lot of mindless macho theatrics if you ask me.So is the rest of this badly written film any good? Well, for those who want punching, kicking, explosions and killing, the film will fit the goods...though this alone doesn't make a movie...or at least a good one. It's also slickly made...and it's obvious they spent a lot of money on the picture to make it look and sound good. But again, this doesn't mean the story is any good. And that brings me to the final thing I didn't like about the film....if you are going to spend $45,000,000 to make it, why is the weakest thing about the thing the writing/plot??Overall, a slick but dopey film. I cannot see, however, anyone putting it in the Bottom 100...not because it's good but because there are hundreds of stupider and worse pictures. I assume this one made the list less because it's really among the very worst but was mostly a big disappointment to Stallone's fans.",

            "content": "There is a marketplace for movies that places them straight to disc. If they're lucky they get a short release in theaters, more often than not in major metropolitan cities that will provide the theater owner with enough ticket buyers to make it worth their while. These movies aren't necessarily made to go straight to disc but they end up that way. Budget cuts, fading star power for the central actor and sometimes to be used as tax write offs, these films can still provide plenty of entertainment, just not enough that they deserve a wide theatrical release. ESCAPE PLAN 2: HADES is one of those films.If you forgot about the first ESCAPE PLAN released in 2013 that film starred Sylvester Stallone as Ray Breslin, the co-owner of a company that tests the reliability of newfangled prisons being constructed, who is betrayed by the firm's co-owner and left to rot in a new prison. He was able to escape with the help of two loyal workers at the company and the assistance of fellow prisoner Emil Rottmayer who was played by Arnold Schwarzenegger. That movie had enough residual star power in both leads to garner a decent take at the box office. Not quite this time around.The new film has Breslin as the sole owner of the company now and their business plan now includes rescuing hostages. When the film opens a plan goes wrong due to a member of the team, Kimbral (Wes Chatham), deviating from the plan and a hostage dying because of it. Returning from the mission Breslin fires Kimbral. Team leader Shu Ren (Huang Xiaoming) feels responsible and Breslin gives him some time off to get himself together.A year later Shu is protecting his cousin Yusheng (Chen Tang), a hi-tech genius about to display a new product, when the two are captured and taken prisoner in a new facility known as Hades. With little information as to the layout and who is behind it all, Shu tries to learn as much as he can in a prison that pits inmate against inmate if daily battles to seek rewards or punishments. On the outside Breslin becomes aware of what's happened and tries to find Shu and his cousin. Along with Hush (Curtis Jackson) and Abigail (Jaime King replacing Amy Ryan) they try and find their way through a computer trail of money to find the location of the prison. At the same time he approaches an old colleague named DeRosa (Dave Bautista) for assistance as well.Inside the prison Shu recognizes Kimbral among the prisoners. Later another member of his team, Luke (Jesse Metcalf) who has been working with Breslin to find him on the outside, is captured and placed in Hades as well. The three are now trying to work together to find a link in the system from the inside. If you don't guess where this is heading I won't spoil it for you.Eventually the big guy, Breslin, has to make his way inside the prison as well. With him on hand and his team working from the outside the odds of escaping increase. But a few items may prevent that from happening. Now, beaten nearly every day and weakened by their time in captivity, the team must work together once again if they are to survive.Let me say up front there are few surprises in this film. Even one of the major turning points I saw coming down the line 10 minutes into the movie and most others will as well. But that doesn't matter. This is a popcorn film, one of those movies you pop into the machine just to have some mind numbing action flick to watch without concern about plot holes or acting ability.Speaking of acting for the most part the casts here does an admirable job. But character development is at a minimum here with the exception of Shu and that's not incredibly deep. Instead the movie focuses on action and offers plenty of it between the hand to hand combat sequences and gunplay near the end. But both Stallone and Bautista are wasted here. For being the box office draws of the film Stallone's part is more limited than one would expect and Bautista, perhaps known more for being a WWE star and as part of the Guardians of the Galaxy, feels rather one note here. He can and has done better.In the end the movie is entertaining enough for a night's rental but my guess is only die-hard Stallone fans will be adding this movie to their collection. The combination of stars from around the globe tells me this was intended to play as well if not better in foreign markets than here in the U.S. That's okay but it will make fans of Stallone wonder what he's doing making movies like this when he can do better. My guess is a paycheck or that he thought the end result would be better. For me it left me longing for past films but still enjoying it just enough to recommend it for action fans not looking for the best there is out there.",

This is the sort of sequel that should never have seen the light of day and it is unfathomable of how something as abysmal such as this came into existence.Poorly written storyline and script, and the acting performances in the movie, despite there being some well enough action stars here, was just questionable. It was as if the actors themselves didn't even buy into the storyline. This was definitely not one of the brightest moments in Sylvester Stallone's acting career.There is a lot of action and fighting in the movie which is the one and only thing the movie has working for it.If you are going to watch an \"Escape Plan\" movie, stick with the first one and give the sequel a wide berth...",

When his trusted operative, Shu Ren, is kidnapped and disappears inside the most elaborate prison ever built, Ray assembles an elite team to assist in the rescue.....The first film was nothing more than a nostalgia trip for both actors and fans of eighties action films alike.The film was the rare steak version of Heat, seeing two iconic actors whom were at the top of their game finally appearing in a film proper together. Yes, we had Expendables, but they hardly had screentime together.This sequel is nowhere near as bad as what others are claiming, and Stallone is in it longer than 10 minutes that others are again claiming, but he does play a secondary charachter.basically the film is a rehash of 1994's 'Fortress' with a hint of the 'Tron: Legacy' soundtrack, and with lots of shaky cam fighting so the winner can have a couple of hours in a room to chill out.The plot is all over the place, the leads are cookie cutter charachters, but it has a charm that only bad movies can supply.Stallone looks beyond tired, and he's really slumming it in the first two acts, 50 Cent looks relieved to be in a film, and Bautista is how he is in every single film he's in.The effects are awful, the bad guy has an awful ulterior motive for his actions, and it all feels like the film was set in an abandoned Laser Quest building.But for all the wrong reasons, it entertains, tertiary charachters are astoundingly bizarre (like legion for example), and it finishes on a cliffhanger that feels more like a closing episode of a mid season thriller series.It's bad, but sometimes, you need these sort of films to reboot your life.",

Not to mention the task being given to a terrorist who joined Breslin's (Sylvester Stallone) team to make their getaway. With this film, you don't get anything near as fancy or thoughtful, in fact, you don't get much of anything at all once Breslin joins members of his team inside the security facility presided over by one of Ray's former employees, fired for taking an initiative that got someone killed. Whatever thought was put into the screenplay for this story could probably fit in a thimble, starting with the idea that a patent could be kept secret once it's been granted. And how would Count Zero from the Legion have the specs for the prison and still be allowed among the general population, especially with Ray and his boys looking for that advantage. Once he had it all figured out, Breslin told Jaspar Kimbral (Wes Chatham) that he was the weak link in the prison plan's design, but personally, I thought it was the script all along. The closing scene had Breslin addressing the head honcho that Kimbral was reporting to, making it look like the sequel to this film would have Ray's elite security team going after him, but if you follow up with 'The Extractors', you'll realize that wasn't the case.",

Noone has ever chewed on the wrapper instead of the chocolate bar.It would be fair to say the CGI is bad and everything else is bad too. But this is not the case. And it is an error to snowball this film by taking account of the CGI.Lets examine this case in reverse. What if the same film frame by frame had an astonishing expensive super impressive CGI ? You would not be able to see past that. The meaning of this film would be hidden under so many layers of heavy CGI that you would not be able to see the meaning.The cheap CGI releases the ability of the viewer to receive the meaning of this film. It makes it easier to see past the effects curtain and see what is on the other side. Stallone knows this. He is an extremely experienced actor and film maker, he might not be a Stanley Kubrick but in this case I think the cheap CGI was meant to be cheap from the start. I think it was a wise choice to do so by Stallone.And that is why we are going to get another escape plan.",

He's not even in it that much - the main character is a martial arts guy. The writers have just watched Fortress and made a weak knock-off.

But this still has Stallone it's still great and having Dave Bautista it's great to have him in movie i enjoyed him he kicks ass in movie he is very entering to watch in movie, and i didn't expect Sequels for Escape Plan but i saw this i am like what ? really did Stallone escape already ? how many times is Stallone is going to get out of prison ? but anyway for me i liked sequel it's a lot of fun it's VERY Slaright Forward Action, i really understand people got pissed off Escape Plan 2 i understand it but i saw movie i enjoyed it everyone got different opinion of opinion but just because Critics say this is crap just watch movie then at end of day you make choice it's not really bad as what you think of Critics write. now i had a lot of fun with this movie. i knew what was i getting into what it was a direct to DVD sequel of Escape Plan i was ok some people say oh this is REALLY BAD BAD i am like ok at end of day i enjoyed it so far it's just fun, good fun time to watch movie i would not say it's time waster i would say it's a lot fun. it's not as bad what everyone says. i had fun Stallone was their kicking ass a lot of action in movie so as Baustia i didn't like movie just for Stallone and Baustia it was just a lot fun very slaright forward action flick. the action was a lot of fun the script is maybe not the best but it's not silly script or dumb the script is good, it's a lot of fun action in film a lot of it, i rather say it's more quicker then first Escape Plan because first had a lot of action and Schwarzenegger nailed his role but in this movie it's a lot fun, very slaright forward then the first Escape Plan movie just moves on i think it's bit too short for people who wants more of sequel. i really wished this was not a direct to DVD film because this was directed buy Steven C Miller he made a lot of bad, bad, bad movies not this movie, this movie is good a lot of fun but he did kinda ruined Sequel for another people i liked movie all movies Steven C Miller made i liked Is Just Escape Plan 2 and Extraction the rest of movies he did crappy Bruce Willis movies was First Kill, Marauders, Nicholas Cage film Arsenal bad films but this in my opinion sequel of Escape Plan is good but i wish it wasn't direct to DVD film. Plot follows Ray Breslin (Sylvester Stallone) is now manages an elite team of security specialists trained in the art of breaking people out of the world's most impenetrable prisons. nothing after events from First Escape Plan nothing about Schwarzenegger character, you have new Asian character with talented Martial Arts Shu (huang xiaoming) know for IP Man 2, but rest of his movies he made is just Asian movies not well known for everything i wished it could be Donnie yen or Tony Jaa but Huang Xiaoming is eh nothing special about his acting but he wasn't annoying character he is a jail breaker as well, When his trusted operative, Shu Ren, is kidnapped and disappears inside the most elaborate prison ever built, now with prison isn't very huge like in first movie i wished it could be big Exactly like that but the prison is big but it's all feels like the film was set in an abandoned Laser Quest building. but not as what you think watch movie then you know what i mean. Ray assembles an elite team to assist in the rescue Shu in prison, i love Action scene in movie Trent Derosa (Dave Baustia) Guardians of Galaxy, Kickboxer: Vengeance, House of Rising Sun, Man with iron fist. is in this movie as second role of movie he is in it his their and their he is i can't say his not much but he is their kicking ass in scene i love in bar when Stallone and Basutia both kickass to kill couple bad guys. villains are aren't so good i thought villains sucked lame villain in movie Gregor Faust (Titus Welliver) known for Lost TV Show, Sons of Anarchy, Town, Argo, Man on Ledge he has been few movies, he is called ZOO keeper keeping his Prisoners like Animals in prison, and he isn't good villain he is not enjoyable not really good villain just nothing i really wished they could hired another actor as villain maybe could hired Johnny Messner or Daniel Bernhardt as villain lead villain have someone kickass with Stallone, elite team Luke (jesse metcalfe) known for Dallas, John Tucker Must Die, i am like ok i am not fan of that actor but he is bit wooden could hired Victor Ortiz could worked again each another like Expendables 3 but Jesse Metcalfe is eh he didn't suit in this movie, Abigail (Jamie King) is good, Curtis ''50 Cent'' Jackson Hush from first Escape Plan. team was ok not best but could Hired MMA Stars reason for Action film, UFC Fighter was in it not to much Tyron Woodley not much in movie only fights with Shu that's it. Stallone Acting is good he looks like he is enjoying it not like in Reach Me where he looks beyond tired, and he's really slumming it in the first two acts,\nStallone is good in movie. the things i hated about this The effects are awful, the bad guy has an awful ulterior motive for his actions. he is very wooden, effects and CGI i am like god why did Steven C Miller directed this i mean he is not best to hire he is not best writer i would eh say he did ok with this movie it's fun slaright forward action film Stallone and Baustia for sure but Steven C Miller is bad director movie needs different director like Isaac Florentine he would have done this movie better or i wished Stallone could written the sequels all of it he is director he hasn't directed movie since Expendables (2010) Stallone could make things a lot and a lot better then to Steven C MIller can't direct for crap i liked movie but it doesn't block me to hate over for director. Stallone has not been more hands on -or more passionate about any other projects he has been involved in. Its pure octane, its fight after fight, guns slinging, hard knocking flick headlined by Stallone in top form. Its not my favorite Stallone film and Basutia film but movie is eh good movie, a good pacing film it didn't suck. still disgusted at the CGI, It could have been better. it has a great twist in middle of movie, 8.10 love action scenes a lot of fun, Stallone and Baustia Rocked in movie it's great and it's fun but hey it's not best but still a lot fun it's worth for your time, it's good to see Sequel it's not bad like what Critics Say how it is, like i said in end of day it's your choice, don't trust Critics it's wrong, it's your choice if you liked movie or not. some characters don't really have much development and some of the tech stories can be a little confusing, never the less it's an enjoyable movie, Sly is great and has his trademark voice and confident attitude, the links to the first movie make a good follow up to the original and I am certainly looking forward to Escape Plan 3 Devils Station.",

            "content": "Chechen terrorists threaten to kill their hostages. The team manages to stage a rescue but one of the hostages is killed due to an algorithm error. Ray Breslin (Sylvester Stallone) has his security firm with Hush (50 Cent) and Abigail Ross (Jaime King). He fires Jaspar Kimbral for the failure. One year later, Breslin's associate Shu (Huang Xiaoming) is protecting his family from business competitors. He is kidnapped and wakes up in high tech prison Hades where prisoners battle in the Zoo. Among the prisoners are his cousin struggling to keep a patent secret which could endanger the world and Kimbral who claims to have been kidnapped a couple of months earlier. Breslin recruits Trent DeRosa (Dave Bautista) to locate the secret Hades prison and stage a rescue.When I see Sly and Bautista in an Escape Plan sequel, I assume that they're in prison planning an escape. This should not be complicated. It should be a simple exploitation B-movie franchise. This movie opens with terrorists demanding the release of a prisoner and I thought Sly is going into the prison to escape with the prisoner, then trading him for the hostages. Baustista could be either the terrorist prisoner or a bystander helping Sly. It's all so easy but the movie refuses to be simple. First, what the heck is algorithm in the minds of the scriptwriter. I don't what it means and how it's Kimbral's fault. Forget all that. The movie continues down a wrong path. Instead of Sly, it's the Chinese guy who gets imprisoned. Again, Sly should be the dude and the rest of his crew could join him in the prison. All of the story should place in the prison. By splitting the story in two, Sly's half is diminished. This is all wrong. It should have been so simple.",

While in the U.S. this was a straight-to-DVD release, it came out in theaters in Russia and China. Despite not having great box office numbers, it still inspired another sequel, 2019's Escape Plan: The Extractors.Stallone, never one to mince words, said on Instagram that this movie was the \"most horribly produced film I have ever had the misfortune to be in.\"Ray Breslin (Stallone) continues to operate his security company with senior members Hush (Jackson) and Abigail (Jamie King), along with Shu Ren (Chinese star Xiaoming), Jasper Kimbral (Chatham, who was in The Hunger Games films) and Luke Graves (Metcalfe, who was on Desperate Housewives).During a hostage rescue mission, Kimbral goes off mission, which leads to a hostage getting killed and Breslin firing him. This leads to him joining the enemy and becoming part of the Hades prison, where he soon imprisons Shu and his cousin Yusheng. He's now forced to battle other prisoners in a fight club and meeting the warden, Gregor \"Zookeeper\" Faust (Titus Welliver, who was on Lost), who wants Yusheng's communications patents in exchange for their release.Breslin learns that Hades is funded by the same mysterious organization who funded the Tomb - from the first movie - and seeks help from an ex-employee, Trent DeRosa (Dave Bautista). And then Luke is caught and sent to Hades, a place where the layout changes every single night. Of course, Breslin allows himself to be arrested and taken to Hades and our heroes win the day.This movie was frankly intolerable. Speaking of intolerable, Pete Wentz from Fall Out Boy is in this, too. And Stallone is only in this for about fifteen minutes. Really.Director Steven C. Miller has been part of several Lionsgate films, such as Extraction, Marauders, Arsenal and First Kill. He also directed a remake of Silent Night, Deadly NIght and almost brought a new version of Motel Hell to the screen.The funniest part of this movie is this revelation from IMDB, which blows the central conceit of the movie out of the water: \"Part of the plot revolves forcing someone to reveal a patent as if it was a secret. Patents are not secret, the point being to make something public to secure protection for commercial use. If something was supposed to be kept secret, then it would be called a secret.\"",

            "content": "The original \"Escape Plan\" movie wasn't an action classic, but it was all the same a fun diversion. Although it underperformed at the box office in North America, it was a hit in China, which explains why several years later we have this sequel. Although I had read some brutal reviews of this sequel here and elsewhere, all the same I decided to give it a chance, because I am usually more forgiving of B movies with limited budgets.The fact that Sylvester Stallone this time around had been demoted to a supporting role, and that there was more focus on the Chinese character, did not bother me. However, pretty much everything else about the movie did. The budget is a lot lower this time around, which often leads to cost-cutting features as tacky sets and frequent close-ups by the cameraman. The cinematography is extremely ugly, being frequently dark and lacking detail. The direction is very poor, with difficult to follow action sequences. The story is very garbled, as if linking footage that might have explained plot details was cut out or never filmed in the first place. But the biggest offender is how BORING the movie plays out. There's no suspense, no energy, and no enthusiasm by anyone in front of or behind the camera. If the producers wanted to appeal to the Chinese market, they would have been better off giving more control of this movie to Chinese filmmakers. Right now on Netflix, there are a number of Chinese movies and television shows that offer some great entertainment, and show that Chinese filmmakers can make great action and drama. But as it is, while some audiences in China or elsewhere may be suckered into watching this sequel as I was, I think that they will be greatly disappointed, and subsequently ignore the upcoming second sequel. I certainly will.",

He has to try his best in order to find him but he will have to return back into his old habits to succeed.Since I had already watched and enjoyed the first movie, I had high expectations from this movie and I expected to watch something better than the first. Unfortunately, this did not happen and I was disappointed by it. The plot was simple, boring and in some moment did not make any sense while the direction which was made by Steven C. Miller was below average. The interpretation of Sylvester Stallone who played for one more time as Ray Breslin was good but not good enough to save this movie. Lastly, I have to say that \"Escape Plan 2: Hades\" is not the best movie and if you have watched the first movie then I am sure you will be disappointed so, I do not recommend you to watch it.",

However, pretty much all of the above is missing from this sequel...To me, Escape Plan 2 came across as being messy, unfocused and overwritten. The film seemed to have about 3 different storylines going on at the same time, but the storylines seemed to have just been carelessly thrown together without the slightest hint of narrative coherency. The pacing of the film is leaden and wearying in comparison to the original film; no matter how much I tried I just couldn't get into this film (in part this was down to the incoherent narrative, but what also didn't help were many of the charmless lead performances - the film is a something of a downer and is certainly a lot less fun than the original film.One other thing that I didn't think was as good in this film as the original was the actual prison escape itself; the original was a bit more thoughtful and the planning seemed to be more careful and believable. Like the rest of the film this aspect seemed careless and rushed this time around - it's supposed to be a top-notch high security best of its kind prison which you can seemingly gain access to just by driving a vehicle through one of its walls??Given how good the first film was I am genuinely shocked by how bad this film was in comparison. It's the sort of quality you'd expect 4 or 5 films into a franchise not in its first sequel. I'm aware that there is now a part 3 to this franchise and given how bad part 2 was I'm weary about whether to watch it or not - although it will take some doing for it to be any worse than this offering.It's little wonder Arnie didn't come back for seconds - he clearly must have read the script.",

Though I give the director kudos for best crossover film it has given us. We saw a snippet of the fast and the furious, I mean they tried so hard to squeeze in a car scene, even though it was clearly unnecessary. There was also a weird Jimmy Neutron vibe, whenever, Huang Xiaoming, the star thought of something brilliant. The prison itself made us feel like we were watching a Star Wars film, it sucked, it made me feel sleepy. The plot itself was an idiotic way to make a sequel to the first one good. I mean the movie stars off where a guy from work gets fired, and the movie suddenly takes off to a revenge story with a guy making a high-tech, advance of the art prison in one year. Stressing the point where he just did all of this just because he got fired by Sylvester Stallone. \nIn conclusion, the film is the worst film we have watched where they scenes made us laugh, and make fun of the acting of all the casts.

Here are a few of his thoughts as we watched it\n\"Does it want anymore studio logos?? Oh there's another one\" \nHow fake does that bruise look??\n\"Did he just throw his cigarette at him??\" \nHow fake was that explosion \n10 mins in. He calls the movies big twist.\n\"Hahaha the zoo keeper!! Bit lame to call yourself the zoo keeper!!\" \n\"Oh my god he is such a bad actor!!\" He was referring to the main guys cousin!! \"That Chef is awful too!!\"\nBig fake laugh and eye roll at the \"It's bad to be back\" line\nThe twist happens \"Oooh I was right!! Didn't see that coming!!\"\nOh god HE is gonna fight the old man!! \n\"Let me guess that's what number 3 (which he didn't know there was) will be about\" \nHe pulled a puzzled expression as the movie ended, as it's abrupt. Before saying \"What a great movie that was\" full of sarcasm.He did like the main character's fight scenes!! Although I didn't, as it was mostly shaky cam and the quick cut that I hate!! For my own amusement, I timed his screen time. He has 19 minutes 56 seconds (not counting his voice over) It seems like he is hardly in the movie during the first half, and then is in it a lot during the last half hour!! but in truth he has only slightly more in the last half hour, in the opening hour he is onscreen for just under 10 minutes, with the remaining 10 minutes coming in the lat half hour, but they use what they have well, and it seems like he is in it, a lot more than he actually is.",

But this so-called jail break \"Escape Plan\" trying so hard to become a franchise series like what Steven Segal did in his awfully bad East Europe adventures, hiring so many bad B-movie and C-level non-talent actors, the Chinese who banked and almost bought up 1/3 of Hollywood studios, it sure is on the right track to churn out the 3rd one immediately after this 2nd sequel. I really don't know what future this franchise would survive, no matter how many MMA or WWE fighters they'd recruit to play those ridiculous roles. Now Sil's hairline and hairdo are exactly the same as what we saw on Seagal's head, all spiked up and looked like what we saw dome on the heads of those guys in the Japanese samurai movies. This film, according to imdb.com was finished in 20 days, it's a rush job, but what I'm more interested is how many days its screenplay was drafted, certainly would be even shorter?

The ones that have a cover similar to the original movie upon which they are (usually very loosely) based? The ones often put out by the likes of Asylum? Yeah, well, that is what Escape Plan 2 is. Or rather, it isn't, seeing as how it is an actual sequel to a much better film, complete with some of the original stars. But that is exactly how it feels - like someone said \"Hey! Let's do a knock off of Escape Plan! It'll be great!\"Except that EP2 is not great. It is, in fact, all kinds of not great. So many kinds of not great, in fact, that they could open a \"Not great\" store and sell the nonsense to other, less incompetent film-makers hoping to make a bad name for themselves in the rip-off business.Little about the movie really works. Even the presence of actors such as Stallone and Bautista can't do more than highlight how bad everything around them is. And it is bad, trust me.The sets for the titular prison \"Hades\" are garishly lit with neon lighting, like a bad Tron ripoff. And that prison is not any prison that could ever be made on Earth. It is something from the future. They have, in addition to the neon lighting, force-fields, robots, hi-tech electro shock things and...my personal favourite... magic manacles that spring out of literally nowhere to shackle two prisoners together. No, I really mean that...out of nowhere!This is the kind of movie I watched in the 80's with mates and a big old crate of beer. We'd sit, we'd drink and we'd mock the crap out of the awful movies we were watching. Well...I'm old now, my mates are far away and that crate of beer steadfastly refused to be a part of this watching, so I guess it sucks to be me. In fact, it sucks to be anyone that has to endure this movie. There is nothing here that you won't have seen in the original (except for the garish lighting and...oh! Did I mention the discordant, overly strident music? I didn't? Well now I have!) For extra bonus \"bad\" points, the music sometimes drowns out the character dialogue (which, in hindsigfht, is probably a mercy). Absolutely nothing here is worth your time. This isn't sequel bad. It's sequel to a sequel to a sequel bad.Still not convinced? Take a gander at the crew credits. Now, I know it is fashionable to give a producer credit to all and sundry when making a movie, but thirty-three of them? Let that settle in for a moment. Thirty-three producers, executive producers and co-producers. In fact, very nearly as many producers as there are actors in this film (and yes, I am counting the random prisoners too). That's too many, people! Have you never heard of the saying about too many cooks, and broth?Still, still not convinced? \"Well,\" You say. \"I like prison breakout movies. I'll find something to like!\" No...you won't. Because even if there was something to like...say... the fight scenes... they are utterly ruined by the over-reliance on \"Shaky-Cam (tm)\"! Yes, swoon as you have little idea of what is going on in a fight scene. Frown as you wonder why even non-fight scenes merit the scene-disrupting presence of the worst gimmick to be consistently overdone since the invention of 3D. Seriously, the shaky-cam...the ever-present neon lighting and some questionable cutting and editing, all make this an assault far worse than anything endured by the movie's characters.Then there are the FX. Super-imposed explosions that look straight out of Southpark. A garage door bursting open as a car rams through it...before the car actually reaches it... you get the idea.I don't know what else to say. It is bad. Badly made. Poorly scripted. Weakly acted and with a story/sets and premise that is just laughable.SUMMARY: Awful, charmless assault on the senses. Bad story, sets and camerawork. Loud obnoxious music. Garish lighting. Like watching a bad film in a disco. A really bad disco. Do yourselves a favour...don't bother with this one.",

It's full of stupid moments that makes the first film look like a masterpiece. It repeats a lot things from that film from a set-up fight used as a distraction to a poorly conceived twist reveal towards the end. The digital effects look shoddy as if they were made using an iTunes app and the editing is wonky in places. It rips off films like Tron Legacy and The Hunger Games making it feel like a cheap looking parody. The film is let down by a lame set up, predictable plot, bland characters and lazy writing. Don't let the film mislead you into thinking this is a Stallone/Bautista actioner as they are only in it for about 15 minutes. Instead it focuses on unknown actors who are not very good at acting (which is most likely because they used to be MMA fighters). The director does an okay job directing some of the action scenes, some of them are well choreographed however they suffer from the dreaded shaky-cam where we can barely see what is going on. The film could have been a lot better if it was backed by a proper production company. It just looks cheaply produced as if it was made by a bunch of incompetent film students. It's let down by a bad story, a slow pace and lack of character development. In the end it's a loud, dumb fun guilty pleasure that (thankfully) runs at 90 minutes.",

This was not interesting, It didn't really have a story although there was an attempt to teach a moral lesson. None of the actors were memorable, the dialogue was totally forgettable as well. I just felt pity for Stallone, he looked so old and he's still trying to do action pics well past his prime. He kind of reminds me of Brett Favre neither one of them could face the fact that their glory days are behind them and instead of staying out of the spotlight they crave just 1 more score. I don't understand it, if you have the money why not retire when you're on top and let your legend speak for you? It's crap like this that tarnishes what you used to be. If you're a big Stallone fan and you feel like you have to see this movie, wait a month it will be on Netflix. I promise you're going to be disappointed.",

It ended being a competent movie that left a lot to be desired from its main cast especially lacking action. For the sequel gone is Arnold and even Stallone kinda take a backseat. The movie is mostly about Xiaoming Huang's character Shu. As for Batista? He is in the movie even less than Stallone. Its pretty obvious they where going for a much smaller budget this time and it show. Even if the prison is more high tech in a way than the one in the first movie, it does seem much cheaper made. What for me tought saved the movie was Xiaoming Huang action scenes. The dude is pretty good at martial arts and weird enough, you could almost consider this sequel to Escape Plan as a martial arts movie.I think the fans of Stallone will be a bit disapointed and maybe even the fans of Batista, as there role are much smaller than the cover poster would let you believe, but if you can pass over that and apreciate the movie for what it is, and if you enjoy on screen martial arts, i think you should had a good time with this movie.",

I'm talking even worse than 'Stop or my Mom will shoot!'\nThis sequel to 2013's surprisingly entertaining original is a pointless affair.\nEscape Plan's USP was the teaming up of Sly and Arnie to deliver a good old 80's style action romp, and boy did they!\nHere Arnie is no where insight. Obviously he must have read the script and turned to his buddy and said \" No Sly, Don't do it!\nGet to the chopper!\"I have absolutely no idea what the plot is of this latest instalment because the acting is so bad it detracts from the story telling.\nEven Sly is terrible!\nI can't believe I'm saying this! Sly you're my hero but c'mon! How can you go from a Golden Globe and a Oscar nomination straight to this?\nStallone has made some poor career choices in the past regarding choosing roles and projects to work on, but this one is a new low. There's absolutely nothing positive to say about this film.The action scenes are poorly staged and CGI is abysmal. There's an explosion at the beginning of the movie that looks laughably bad.\nDirection has no direction.\nDialogue is hilariously cheesy.\nEditing has been done by a three year old with kitchen scissors...The list goes on.Due to Arnie's absence the film makers have managed to rope in Dave Bautista as a replacement but both he and Stallone take a back seat in this movie leaving most of the film to a bunch of Hollywood Z listers.\nHonestly I just don't understand why this film exists. The fact that there's a third instalment on the way is mind boggling.In all honesty I couldn't sit through the entirety of this terrible film.\nI gave up when Bautista turned to Sly and asked\n\"Is it good to be back?\"\nTo which Sly replies \"No it's bad to be back!\"\nThat was me done like a Christmas turkey. I hit the stop button, my hero had fallen from grace!\nWhat so now you're stooping so low as to take Arnie's line and adapt it?\nC'mon Sly you can't do this to me!\nI hope with all my heart that my favourite movie star of all time redeems himself in Creed 2 because Escape Plan 2 is the worst film of his magnificent career!",

And it's more a Chinese film now, than an American one. Don't get me wrong, I liked that part, with the martial arts and the Sun Tzu like thinking. Only it was also really badly made as a story. It felt like a compilation of all the cinematics in a video game put on YouTube. The game would have been interesting, but it doesn't exist, while the cinematics are just like one would expect: rushed and not relatable.Bottom line: if you started watching it, you probably like escape movies, so you will enjoy this, maybe. But look at the great cast: Stalone, Bautista, Wes Chatham (Amos from The Expanse), Xiaoming Huang (with great martial prowess)... even 50 Cent as a dorky hacker... ahem...

This is not at all like the first escape plan, in fact Stalone plays a minor role at least initially, so much so, that I was feeling this was just a way for the studio to make a quick buck off of the first escape plan and billing it as another Stalone movie. Even the opening scene is much more gritty than the first, almost like Zero dark thirty. I started thinking maybe they are trying to go for a higher caliber setup, but then seemed to fissile for a bit. However if you sit through it, it's more of a chess game. Sure there are plenty of plot holes and if you blink things can get confusing, however, the acting is pretty good and the overall plot and twists are enough to carry it through. Overall I ended up enjoying the movie and getting into it much more than I expected from the opening. The ending is a layup for another movie, which I immediately suspected would not happen as I know many will not like this movie at all.

There is simply no excuse for how poor the effects are, I really want to stress that because it's freaking 2018 for crying out loud. CGI should be practically indistinguishable from reality at this point in time. However, what we get instead is a complete backwards tumble to CGI from the year 2000.But enough about the effects. Let's talk about the movie itself. The entire thing is expositional. Each scene exists in a linear fashion and serves no other purpose than to terribly propel the plot. There is no downtime for character progression. There is no progression. There is just \"I guess we need to put a scene here, so let's just regurgitate the first thing that comes to our mind.\" Half this movie is over before you even realize it. It's like a machine gun firing on full auto in terms of how fast the scenes are presented to the viewer. It's almost like the creators wanted the scenes to go by quickly just to keep people from noticing how crappy the story is-or keep them from realizing there is no story. \"These people need to fight each other for REASONS, why? Shut your mouth and give us your money!Look, I enjoyed the first movie. I thought it was actually a decent film. However, I really don't know what the hell happened in this. I even jokingly predicted that the next movie was going to be in Outer Space, and apparently that actually turned out to be true, because it's already in development. That's not a good thing. I shouldn't be able to jokingly predict your next move, while thinking of the stupidest idea that I possibly can. The fact that I was correct about it, is just an insult to your intelligence as writers and directors.Giving this a 1/10 and no that's not at all harsh. This movie should not exist.

Dave Bautista replaces Arnold Schwarzenegger in this sequel, while Huang Xiaoming, Wes Chatham, Jesse Metcalfe, Jaime King, Chen Tang and Titus Wellive also join the cast. 50 Cent reprises his role from the original movie as well. It was directed by Steven C. Miller and it was written by Miles Chapman (who also co-wrote the first film). The movie was released directly to video in the U.S., and it's gotten mostly negative reviews from critics. I found it to be mostly entertaining. Ray Breslin (Stallone) has built a new team of security experts. One of them has lost his trust though, Jaspar Kimbral (Chatham), so he fires him. Shortly later, another one of Ray's team, named Shu (Xiaoming), goes missing. Ray believes he's being held in a new inescapable fortress like prison. So he gets himself locked up again, in order to get his friend out. The movie is pretty routine Stallone action fun, so I enjoyed it. Once again, he's casting an ensemble of younger (and hipper) actors as his costars though. I'm fine with that here. Still, as I look back at the movie now, it definitely wasn't that good (I realize now). I did like it while I was watching it though, and I'd definitely still recommend it to a Stallone movie fan.",

After a job goes bad the team breaks up only to be brought back together when a new secret prison, the titular Hades, threatens one of their own. The Good: Dave Bautista is fun for the three minutes or so he is in the movie.\n \nI also like the way the sets are a throwback to the Full Moon pictures of the 1980's with all the neon and bad special effects. The Bad: Dave Bautista is the only fun interesting character in the movie. The way he has been arguing with Disney we may see him in a lot more direct to video films like this. His loss is honestly our gain.The movie Cube managed a much more effective future prison look on a much smaller budget twenty years ago. I found the sets and special effects hilariously bad. I am not sure the filmmakers really meant that.The Ugly: To say this movie's plot makes no sense is an understatement. The futuristic prison contains advanced technology (healing robots, virtual reality etc) that is certainly more profitable to market to the outside world than the current kidnap people and makes them fight so they will reveal the industrial secrets business plan. It is like one of those movies where the bad guy invents a ray that can control the weather and then decided to use it to rob a bank.In Conclusion: I have not seen the first Escape Plan but I understand it isn't that bad a movie. Why they thawed out Sylvester Stallone for this junk I have no idea. This is clearly one of those international co-productions meant for foreign audiences. This is not always a bad thing. Bloodrayne is an awful movie filled with international stars but it is also a fun movie filled with sex, violence and hammy acting. This honestly has no action, nudity or violence. Just a bunch of nobodies wandering around a set from 1980's The Apple while some American stars pop in for glorified cameos. More purgatory than Hades I am afraid.",

            "content": "Escape plan 2: Hades, the straight to dvd sequel to the Awesome \"Schwarzenegger\" & \"Stallone\" team-up action prison Thriller \"Escape plan\" & this flick has a stunning look, it's a futuristic-noir kung-fu action Thriller & \"Stallone\" is not the main lead here, \"Ray Breslin\" has a new younger team with \"Jesse Metcalfe\" \"Dave Bautista\" \"Wes Chatham\" & new main lead in the excellent & tough as hell \"Huang Xiaoming\" & this guy is great, he is a fantastic fighter & makes an excellent brutal action hero!!!\nTo round out the \"Expendables\" style cast we also have \"Curtis Jackson\" back as \"Hush\" & \"Jaime King\" as \"Abigail\" both who appeared in the first film.\nThis story is about one of there own who turns \"bad\" & sets his old team mates up & locks them up in a brutal futuristic prison, this new lock-up is mesmerising to look at with it's colourful glowing neon lights everywhere like something out of \"Tron\" or \"Blade runner\" & with the Awesome pulsing electronic score that's straight out of the 80's sci-fi genre it's actually a really good well made action film, the fight scenes are excellent & brutal with blood & grit.\nThis is actually one of the Coolest Action movies I've seen in a long time, there's something raw & retro about this sequel, the hypnotic lights & music completely sucked me into this dark & dangerous prison world, the visuals are stunning, often the film feels so dark with it's tough 80's style tone & moody atmosphere, it's an excellent low-budget movie & it's fine that \"Mr.Ego-Stallone\" is a bit part here because the younger team are an interesting bunch.A very good movie considering it's a straight to dvd sequel to a big budget cinema released film, Escape Plan 2 tries to be completely different from it's original & at that it succeeded, it's obviously not better than the brilliant first film but it's a million times better than the more dull & boring 3rd film, I'm surprised to hear that \"Stallone\" doesn't like part 2 at all & considers part 3 to be way better? Know idea how? Or why?\nEscape plan 3: Hades is a visually stunning sci-fi action Thriller made by what seems to be a visionary director, I'm going by the excellent style of this film, \"Stallone\" is good as \"Ray Breslin\" again but he's not the big main part & maybe that's why he didn't like it? Because in part 3 it's more his lead role again!!!\nOh i have to say that i was impressed with \"Jesse Metcalfe\" in an action role, he's actually really good & is one of the better characters of the movie!!!\nAnyway i really enjoyed part 2 & it was a good choice giving the main lead part to \"Huang\" as Shu Ren, the guy is a total tough nut & a good moody & ready to strike action lead.",

            "content": "The first Escape Plan movie is simply fun, intense and a great call back to 90's action film, starring two of the biggest 90's action star: Sylvester Stallone and Arnold Schwarzenegger. This one, nope! Confusing plot, bad direction, and overall, it's a snooze! Well, one might argue that this movie is straight-to-DVD, well I'll argue back that it has a theatrical release in my place so might as well rating it like an actual movie in an actual theater.Yup, the movie still sucks.Pros:\nStallone, Bautista, and 50 CentSylvester Stallone once again did a good job as Ray Breslin though he did just a quarter of what he did in the first Escape Plan. Dave Bautista although also didn't get much to do, did a good job as DeRosa. Lastly, Curtis \"50 Cent\" Jackson did a good job as Hush the hacker.Production design/set piecesThe production design is great in this movie. All set pieces looked great for a straight-to-DVD movie. The lighting looks great. The neon futuristic look also looks good.Cons:\nCharacters*sigh* where should I start...\nThis movie is just a giant paycheck for everyone. Stallone isn't even the main character! He didn't do much in the movie until literally the 3rd act. Bautista is wasted in this movie, he doesn't even appear in the movie for more than 10 minutes. The \"main character\", which is Shu, played by Huang Xiaoming isn't as charismatic, nor as interesting as Ray. This movie felt like a \"passing the torch\" movie, and that kinda felt forced. The main baddie in the villain, had no motivation in this movie other than revenge, and he's really terrible! There's also this one lady who looks like cheap Margot Robbie knock-off. The supporting characters weren't even memorable, we don't even had a proper introduction to them! No names, no backstory, nothing! (other than Shu has a sibling and the banter between them, and that's it!)PlotThere's doesn't even a plot in this movie. It's confusing, it's dreadful and it's horrible. There's no depth in the story, it's just some corporation who wants this tech, and some revenge plan along with it! That's it! That's the movie! Some plot points also don't make sense, and some crucial scenes I believe were either cut from the movie, or just, y'know, too lazy to even filmed it.CGIIt looks like a low-budget fantasy drama on my local TV station. It's looks horrible, some were good, but overall it's bad. Even the explosions were CGI! C'mon, does Lionsgate afraid to shell out a couple hundred thousand dollars for a decent explosion?CinematographySome were stunning, the rest were bad. The fight scenes involves your usual vomit-inducing shakey cam and quick cuts. You even have a guy who clearly knows Wing Chun (Chinese martial arts), and clearly knows how to fight, so why there's still shakey cams?!EditingThe editors clearly doesn't know how to edit a movie. They could have just follow the plot in chronological order, but nope, they jumbled the scenes to make the already confusing movie even more confusing.Overall, Escape Plan 2 is confused, unfocused and a horrible sequel to a perfectly fine action-thriller movie. This movie is clearly a simple cash grab. It doesn't deserve your money, it doesn't deserve your time, all you get from watching this movie, is a good 90 minutes long nap. What a shame.",

Alot of people seriously think this movie is worse than the worst of Steven Seagal movies ? Let me put it straight; its not ! Im a long time Sylvester Stallone fan and I loved the first Escape Plan (2013). I waited a long time to watch this movie because I heard its supposed to be the worst movie in movie history. But now that I have watched ut...twice...I must say that I was actually pleasantly surprised. I enjoyed it. Yes, its made on a low budget. But they made the most out of the bucks...it looks ok for the most part (minus a terrible cgi explosion in the beginning wtf). They made the top secret prison facility look really cool...loved the robot. Think Running man ! Actually the stylish look of the movie and the very, very cool (!) retro 80's synth score makes this a fun and cool B-movie experience. The style, score and overall atmosphere reminds me somewhat of Beyond the black rainbow (something I never expected of a Sly movie). I was even surprised Sly had as much screentime as he did...he was a major part of the movie, eventhough not as much as in the original. I must admit he does come across as a little tired and uninterested...he does seem to phone it in little, probably not the most exciting project he was ever part of. But he is a professional and delivers ok. The story, characters and the flow of the story...could have been better for sure. Its not a 10 star movie, but Im giving it 10 to balance all the ridiculous 1 star reviews. If you are a fan of stylish cyberpunk B-movies you might want to give it a chance.",

It's not easy to compete with the pair Stalone + Arnold especially when the cast does not include big or established names outside of them. Main characters feel shallow, the prison is too futuristic and the mechanisms feel too complex and not like a prison at all as it's more about the Arena than the cells and the system itself. The flow is kind of confusing for the viewer and the plot is not deep at all. It's good that the movie is 1 and a half hour long. Action movies usually should not be more more than 100'. The fighting scenes are okay and enjoyable for the casual fan. Some of the dialogue and the escape sequences can be considered fun.\u270d It's a decent movie at best, but watchable nevertheless. You might enjoy it yet not get filled by enthusiasm, every film needs the proper expectations. If this one did not act like a clickbait with the major names being promoted, maybe it would have done better because the hype hurted it but it's not that bad after all.

Anyone who paid the $6 on iTunes or Vudu is just a dum bass, for sure. Go to the Redbox and get some popcorn. It's really not as bad as has been reported.

Not mine.Anything you remember from the original you might as well toss out the window. This movie is as B-level as you get, possibly C. Remember those direct to DVD Steven Seagal movies? This one is right up those trash buckets' alley. Stallone and \"The Animal\" Dave Bautista have secondary roles at best. If I had to count, I'd say Dave utters, maybe, 8-9 lines the entire movie, none of which are interesting or memorable. The movie itself is so ridiculous, illogical, and scattered. There's no substantial plot, no real point to what little plot exists beyond that unsubstantial mess, and anything remaining is as cheap and low-grade as you get. The entire movie is full of throwaway characters. When you do watch this, just count on six hands how many characters are in the movie yet have no actual point what so ever. For fun, I'll give you a quick start:The blonde/brunette girl who OooOoOoooOOs at the beginning, in the truck (maybe ... Abigail?).The brunette girl who works for Stallone (maybe ... Abigail?).The blonde girl who works for Stallone (maybe ... Abigail?).The 3 Legion HackersThe Scar-Faced African GangsterThe girlfriend of the main Jet Li's \"brother\"JESSE METCALFE (I mean, I'm laughing as I type this, but I'm still trying to figure out WHAT exactly his entire point in the film was. Thinking, thinking, thinking, deep in my mind, and still can't figure it out. The guy is next to useless, beyond so, even, and comes off as just a helpless puppy in the movie who is there just to make the other main characters seem more useful). Dave Bautista You could even argue 50 Cent, but I guess he does have a purpose in the film, and at leas this character contributes something, even as ridiculous as it is.Apparently this Hades prison has no ability to stop wave-based signals either, for 2-way audio communication works just fine in this electrified floor setting. Really, the entire prison is a joke. It's security, its layout, its prisoners, the way its ran, the way the prisoners work ... none of it has any thought behind outside a couple of screen writers who drew the story out on a napkin over lunch. It is that shallow. Let's not even talk about the abysmmal \"shakey-cam\" all of these trash A-C level action movies have started abusing for the past 15 years. Or the lack of direction. Or the awful script. The poor dialogue. The vacant acting. The amateur cinematography...There is no redeeming qualities to this movie--at all. You will watch it, you will (maybe) finish it.

In 2018 what this really tells you is that the official release was not in the US -- who still watches DVDs in the US? A little bit of research will tell you that this was mostly financed by Chinese investors, which is why the main star of the movie is Chinese. Basically the story is Chinese with foreign actors that were filmed in China, yet then some filming with the Escape Plan actors was filmed in the US and then integrated into the movie. Are the US actors and foreign actors ever on the same screen with each other? If so it is limited. Knowing this, you should compare this movie with other movies of the same caliber... Chinese action/martial arts movies. The \"Escape Plan\" skin is just to give it some credibility in the US with minimal effort by the US actors. This is very common in sequels that aim to setup a franchise.... Stallone announced a 3rd movie and it will most likely be a great movie if it is based in the US and not as liked in China, or a great movie if based in China and not as liked in the US. Either he wants to be serious with the franchise (which we will know how serious if he, 50-Cent, and Bautista are in the next film). All of this being the case here, one should watch this movie out of the eyes of a fan of 80's action beat-em-up mixed with 90's action martial-arts mixed with cheap fX, older action stars that don't move around that much anymore because they are like 80 years old (yeah, seriously.... can you do backflips even at 55??), and the introduction of new actors/actresses in hopes that they can make a career and Stallone can make some money off of the whole thing. The dude is brilliant when it comes to creating and maintaining franchises and stretches them out for decades to make millions and millions of dollars---- Rocky (with the new film coming out this year it will be 42 years of movies), Rambo (with the new film coming out in 2019 it will be 37 years of movies), The Expendables has been running 9 years already with the new movie slated for next year, Escape Plan will be on its 6th year next year, and don't forget that Stallone owned the late 80's early 90's action genre with roughly 10 blockbuster movies that made almost a billion dollars combined. What does all of this say??? It says that he knows what he is doing as an actor and as a film maker. Having a little bit of understanding how Hollywood operates it is easy to see that this movie isn't really Escape Plan: Hades.... it is Escape Plan in China: Hades. This movie is easily a 5 star movie. If you love Stallone you will like this movie. If you love 50-Cent you will enjoy his cameos. And if you like Chinese martial arts with very colorful gadgetry (ever been to Asia?!) then you will really like this movie. The movie is not a 1 star. But it is not a 10 either.

            "content": "Another one of those sequel movies where the initial movie was somewhat decent or had success, so the producers (or whoever was in charge) thought it would be a good idea to make another one about basically the same thing and it turns out to be a disaster. \"Shocker\"! I actually somewhat liked the first 'Escape Plan' movie starring Sylvester Stallone and Arnold Schwarzenegger. It was nothing brilliant, but at least it had some entertainment value.The same can't be said about the sequel, though. Many would give up after about 20-30 mins, but I decided to see how low its score would drop on the scale by the end of it. Well, the answer is: very low.First of all, the plot and the writing is terrible - the story and the opening sequences make little to no sense. At one point I just gave up on trying to make any sense out of it and just wanted to see the \"brilliant\" conclusion, which was (unsurprisingly) weak and felt rushed, but at that point I was happy it was over. All of this is only made worse by the awful acting. If you just look at the names on the cast you might find some well-known names like Dave Bautista, Jaime King and Jesse Metcalfe, but it's all a trap. I wonder if they now regret having this movie on their r\u00e9sum\u00e9. Throughout the movie the acting is so stiff that it just doesn't bring any interest in any of the characters. The viewer just never really cares or roots for the supposed good guys nor despises the actions of the bad guys that's how plain they are.In this sequel Sylvester Stallone is back playing Ray Breslin - one of the main guys of the first movie, however the role of his character is diminished to the point where he might be better off being left out of it. But even if he had the main role, it wouldn't help much to save this movie. It just feels that Sylvester is getting too old for this action/tough guy business - we've just seen too many of these already.Setting aside the acting part, I actually found the camera work to be decent for my taste, unfortunately in the final cut it's meshed with some poor CGI, which spoils the only thing that might be considered positive about this movie.In short recap, yes, you can find some shootouts, a car chase and plenty of fight scenes in the movie, but it's all just one big, MEH! It's an empty shell with no substance.\nIf you haven't seen the first movie then I'd recommend watching that one instead, otherwise - avoid!",

            "review_title": "No Escaping A Second-Rate Sequel!!!",
            "content": "Back in 2013, Sylvester Stallone and Arnold Schwarzenegger co-starred in Swedish director Mikael H\u00e5fstr\u00f6m's intelligent, suspenseful, white-knuckled, Houdini-esque epic \"Escape Plan\" about an expert who breaks out of prisons for a living. A former criminal prosecutor who became a prison security expert, Stallone played Ray Breslin, a past master at escaping from the most foolproof prisons. Wardens dreaded the prospect that he would undermine their elaborate security procedures, so that he could crash out. Mind you, \"Escape Plan\" broke no records, eventually coining a mere $137 million worldwide. Nevertheless, not only did the producers must have faith in Sly, but also the Chinese box office. Produced at a cost of $20-million, \"Escape Plan 2: Hades\" has coined almost $14 million in China. Presumably, the American release will add to the coffers. Basically, \"Escape Plan 2\" is barely half as good as its impeccably produced predecessor. Many things have changed. First, Schwarzenegger doesn't reprise his role as Rottmayer. Since he didn't work for Breslin's company, Rottmayer had no real narrative reason to return. Second, Dave Bautista appears in a cameo as a member of Sly's team. About \"Escape Plan 2,\" Bautista has said, \"It's completely different than \"Escape Plan one. It's a different vibe, a different look. Obviously, I'm coming in and filling in the gap Arnold left . . .\" Third, Ray Breslin himself spends more time shuffling papers than shooting ruffians. \"Aggression Scale\" director Steven C. Miller orchestrates a smartly-staged bar room shootout for Breslin. Nevertheless, he has others perform the grunt work. Basically, younger hands-- Chinese actor Xiaoming Huang of \"Ip Man 2\" and Jesse Metcalfe of \"John Tucker Must Die\"-conduct the heavy lifting. Curtis \"50 Cent\" Jackson reprises his role as the computer nerd Hush. More accurately, you could describe \"Escape Plan 2\" as \"Escape Plan: The Next Generation,\" because Stallone shows up about every twelve to fifteen minutes to stir the pot. Meanwhile, \"Bosch's\" Titus Welliver plays a role like Jim Caviezel's prison warden in the previous movie. Jaime King is on hand momentarily in a role that resembles Amy Ryan's far larger role in the original \"Escape Plan.\"Before he penned \"Escape Plan,\" scenarist Miles Chapman wrote the story and screenplay to 2006's \"Road House 2: Last Call,\" so he knows something about budgetary sequels. The interesting thing about Chapman's script is the way he has moved protagonist Ray Breslin (Sylvester Stallone) smoothly from life & death field activities to daily office drudgery. Of course, five years have passed since \"Escape Plan.\" Moreover, Ray had to take over his business after the fate of his treacherous partner Lester Clark (Vincent D'Onofrio of \"Full Metal Jacket\") in \"Escape Plan.\" \"Escape Plan 2\" opens with a slam-bang, prison break as a hostage drama unravels in a scummy Chechen lock-up. Our heroes are trapped in a prison where they've been sent to rescue some women, and the deadline elapses. Everything about this opener is supercharged for maximum suspense. Unfortunately, it is difficult to worry about any of these individuals because we've never seen them before. Literally, they constitute the Next Generation, but IMDB. COM lists none of them as cast members in the forthcoming \"Escape Plan 3,\" currently in post-production. Unfortunately, one of them dies during the breakout because team leader Jaspar Kimbral (Wes Chatham of \"The Philly Kid\") trusted algorithms rather than his team. Robots versus humans is a staple science fiction theme, and lenser Brandon Cox makes the evil, automated prison known as 'Hades' that our heroes wind up in for most of their shenanigans look like a futuristic sci-fi saga. Ray fires upstart Jaspar for his preference in algorithms over his cohorts. A year later, another of Ray's employees, Shu (Xiaoming Huang) vanishes mysteriously along with his cousin, Yusheng (Chen Tang of \"Let's Be Cops\"), an ultra-high-tech wizard. Eventually, Breslin and company figure out Shu and Yusheng are being held in a black-site prison, much like 'the Tomb' in \"Escape Plan,\" and Breslin ponders the prospect that it may be a case of payback from his earlier adversaries.The identity of the chief villain nicknamed Galileo should come as no revelation. You'll probably see it coming long before the filmmakers expose this character for his foul play. In some respects, Galileo is incredibly ambitious. Apparently, he has abducted, imprisoned, and tortured those that may yield him the most wealth, treasure, and information. Hades is a state-of-the-art, practically computerized, black-site prison with a robot serving as physician. When Breslin broke out of the prison in \"Escape Plan,\" he persuaded the prison doctor to honor the Hippocratic Oath. Shu generates no influence with the robotic doctor. However, there is no shortage of flesh and blood guards for David Bautista to mow down during the fourth quarter of this 90-minute opus with 4 minutes of end credits. Meantime, Shu is surprised to find Jaspar incarcerated in Hades, too! The second member of Breslin's crew to plunge into the prison is reckless Luke (Jesse Metcalfe), who was chasing down a lead when he was captured. The man who manages the prison, the Zoo Keeper (Titus Welliver), is doing everything to sweat information from Shu's cousin about his number of computer programming patents. When the Zoo Keeper isn't torturing inmates, everybody's favorite pastime in Hades is \"Fight Club\" style brawls. Obviously, this is one prison that discriminates against the handicapped. Predictably, when the youngsters get themselves into a tight spot, the old man has to enter the arena. Galileo accommodates Breslin when he has him abducted. Trent Derosa (David Bautista of \"Spectre\") shows up late in the game from the outside like the cavalry.Director Steve C. Miller deserves credit for making this straight-to-video actioneer as palatable as possible. Stallone isn't the star, but he has a couple vigorous, action-packed scenes to keep his arteries from hardening. \"Escape Plan 2: Hades\" is a tolerable potboiler for anybody but hardcore Stallone aficionados who want to see every single one of his films. Interestingly, Stallone called it the \"most horribly produced film\" of his career.",

            "content": "Escape Plan 2: Hades (1 out of 5 stars). Escape Plan 2 is just pure horrible and nothing can describe why Sylvester Stallone would agree to being in this sequel. The first film was at least decent with him and Arnold Schwarzenegger costarring together and being in a movie were they have to work together to break out a maximum-security prison. However, this sequel fails to live up to the first movie. For starters, this film is a straight to dvd type of movie. You can expect it to be low quality this time. Sylvester Stallone is barely in this movie as well. The plot is lame and dumb. It focuses on Shu Ren (Huang Xiaoming) who works for Breslin's security company and gets captured. And placed in a futuristic prison. Were the owner of the place is known as the zookeeper. And rewards the prisoners if they survive the fights. They have a robotic droid that is a medic in med bay. They have a hologram cell of your preferred setting. Shu is captured cause the owner of the prison wants something from Ren. That involves satellites. While Ray (Sylvester Stallone) and his team Abigail (Jaime King), Hush (Curtis Jackson), and newcomer Luke (Jesse Metcalfe) are trying to get in and to break out with Ren. The plot was all over the place. From the beginning scene was a failed mission of a break out. And a twist that is not as exciting. It was just bad.The direction was horrible. The shootouts were terribly executed. Come on, guys are shooting at each other up front and the bullets are not hitting anyone or anything. It is like they are shooting blanks towards each other. The fight scenes are consisting of close up camera shots and quick editing cuts which does not help make it exciting. Stallone should have passed on this sequel. Dave Bautista was a waste in this role. Appearing for a small amount of screen time. Huang Xiaoming gave a dull performance. Overall, Escape Plan 2: Hades is just pure terrible. A stupid plot. The concept is overkilled with a futuristic prison that has holograms, a rotating prison that changes its layouts, a robotic medic, and force field doors. Yes, it is ridiculous. The action and shootouts are badly executed. And sadly, it does have an ending that leaves for another sequel.",

But then he turns against the terrorists and helps the hostages escape. He also takes the time to destroy their weapons cache, which delays their escape and as a result one of the hostages ends up shot.Back in the US we learn this was an operation run by Breslin (Stallone) who ends up firing the one guy responsible for the delay the in the escape. This guy, Kimbral, was trying to modernize Breslin's operation with algorithms and according to one such algorithm they should have all made it out in time alive even with the destruction of the weapons.Years later, one of Breslin's team members, Shu, is tasked with protecting his brilliant tech-guru cousin. There is an attack and both end up taken prisoners in some high tech prison called HADES. The prison us run by no other than Kimbral but his investors want the technology that Shu's cousin developed so they're torturing him to the get the info. Kimbral developed the prison precisely so that not even Breslin could escape. Meanwhile another guy from the the team is captured and in HADES. So Breslin and 3 or 4 left on his team will have to figured out who to get their friends out, while those one the inside will have to figure out how to escape from a prison with no clear layout with the help of some other convicts. Eventually Breslin himself gets himself imprisoned to get the others out.Not sure Escape Plan ever needed a sequel but it certainly didn't need a C-movie sequel. For the first 20 minutes or so EP2 actually works that is until HADES is introduced. In HADES everything is obnoxiously dark except for some 80s special effects occasionally. It is probably the lamest movie-prison ever shown. How they paid whoever claimed to be a set-designer I don't know. But like all Chinese-coprodutions, this movie doesn't exactly aim for quality and excellence. There are some cool martial-arts scenes but then other action scenes are weak. The only cool thing are some robots since this is an automated AI-run prison. Bautista is in this movie, not kicking butt. Curtis Jackson not sure what his role is here.

Because honestly while watching this I was making up my own escape plan how I would escape from this. I've used an AA rating recently to describe another atrocious film and now I'm afraid to say I'm going to use the AA rating again. This film is absolutely atrocious! I literally wasted, no hang on I'm being cruel because this film did have 1 redeeming thing, the end titles. This is actually more sci-fi than a thriller or action movie and the marital arts fight sequences are great to watch but other than this it's one to avoid. Don't waste your money or time and if it is ever shown on TV, do anything to avoid this. Rating 3 out of 10",

What else can one ask for?Ladies and gentleman, we are talking Sylvester \"Sly\" Stallone, an ICON of action movies who, many newcomers movie goers wouldn't know, starred in Rambo, Rocky I-IV and The Specialist along Sharon Stone.Then we have Dave Bautista - brawn meets intellect- where an alpha male the size of Koko the Gorilla solves Rubik's Cube faster than Will Smith's character in Pursuit of Happyness.50 cent stars as a 'sly' ... (get it?) higher-tier consultant or something of the firm and is relatively restrained for all his chutzpah and Crack-A-Bottle soundtrack.The movie portrays, projects and extrapolates what it would be like in futuristic prison. Gone are the days of Salinas County Jail and what not. We have AI-driven, robotics who take care of an entire engine that is called Hades (underground.. see your Greek Mythology).I was a big fan of Stallone in the first Escape Plan where he wrote a dissertation about the structural engineering of the prison and the same intellect, level-headedness, coolness and wit (such as Go scene) is present in the sequel.Each shots are cinematographic masterpiece and not your typical Instagram filters. Sure critics will say the delivery is wooden, or complaint of the ropey dialogue or abrumpt jumping of scenes or lack of storylines and numerous other plotholes... but the end the of the day this is not your average Fast and The Furious meets Prison Break meets Tolstoy's War and Piece.In fact, some of the robotics scene alone is worth the movie entrance and budget of many Hollywood films. Only Hollywood can provide insight and glimpse into superior graphics, visualization and VFX as to what a futuristic prison will look like with hi-tech gadgets.Bravo. Well done folks. Take a bow. It may not be an Oscar material but sure HP Lovecraft, Jules Verse and even Robert Heinlein and Asimov (as in conjoined Robert Heinlein and Asimov in an alterante universe) could have foreshadow'd such master piece.With all aplogies to Shakespeare:If Escape Plan Franchise is the.food of love, play on!!Play on!",

Luckily, movies like this are generally easy to spot from a mile away, long before even watching them, where them being good would be the real and actual surprise, so I had absolutely no high expectations, nor was I disappointed with how terrible this movie is; it was exactly as I figured it would be.Though the first outing, 2013's Escape Plan, was not too bad and rather enjoyable, with Arnold Schwarzenegger adding some authentic charm, 50 Cent was terrible in it, and he continues to be just as abysmal and flat in this instalment. The man simply cannot act, though he can somehow appear palatable to a point where it seems like he is at least alright.Dave Bautista was average, while his character felt incredibly random, and for Stallone, I feel this movie, and franchise, is a \"why not\" type of involvement for him, or maybe even a favor. His performance was okay with a splash of lazy, which I doubt he was too bothered about, while Huang Xiaoming seemed to have given it his all, but sadly his all wasn't great at all. The story is a repeat for the most part that even felt thin on this occasion, the CGI came straight out of PlayStation 2, and the directing was simply, bad, with dreadful action sequences.This movie is an unsurprising 3.4/10.",

I couldn't care less who is in it from the poster if it's a good story it's a good story regardless if it's actually Sly escaping these over the top prisons or not. The director just wanted the movie to look pretty for the visuals and everyone looked in dire need of a shower. Granted you're not going to look like a movie star in jail but I don't know.If he was going to out source everyone to be in a team why not spend the first little while training a team or something so it's easier to process who is who and actually focus on the story. The first 5 or so minutes I wasn't sure if I was watching the right movie. You know the movie was going to bomb though when there was half a dozen production teams.I think I spent more time writing this review than watching the movie. 0 out of 10.

Cheap-looking, cheaply executed entertainment with meh acting and an overwrought story that can't just pick a lane genre-wise. It's an action thriller, with a bit of a sci-fi element that doesn't really work (the prison is futuristic and high tech), making it look like a Doctor Who (2005) episode.It may be the worst of Sylvester Stallone's career, which is sad because he still has charisma and physicality. I love Dave Bautista, and was excited to see him and Stallone doing their thing together, even if Arnold's absence is still damaging to the movie's appeal. Sadly, Bautista is barely in it. He is in like, three or four scenes total, and he only has two action scenes, in which all he really does is shoot some dudes. Sylvester Stallone strangely isn't in it as much as he should be, though I guess he's there a fair amount. But when he gets top-billing, he should appear way more than a fair amount. It's horribly underwhelming.The action sequences are the movie's saving grace, and that's not saying much. There are some well-choreographed fight scenes, a cool bar shootout where Stallone and Bautista kill bad guys, and some good sequences at the end. Sly does have a brutal final fight, which is cool. The violence is pretty graphic, but not OTT.Xiaoming Huan is a great martial artist tho. He takes center stage for much of the movie with lots of cool kung fu-oriented fight scenes. My problem isn't that he's so central, it's that he's central at the expense of Stallone and Bautista. It's like when you're at a concert for a band you love, and you really like the opener band, but then you realize they have the majority of the concert's length. No matter how good they are, they're not who you're there for.It's just kind of a mess. The script is muddled, the action is well-done but kind of underwhelming, the two great leads are barely present, and the villains are completely forgettable. It might be really hard to like for a lot of people, and this is as forgiving a review as I can give. It's definitely not the worst movie I've ever seen, like it seems to be with so many other people. It's still better than the DTV garbage Steven Seagal is still putting out.",

I think the main issue was based on the prison scenes:The prison was too stripped back... I understand what they were trying to do by making a prison with no loopholes. However - one of the things that I find exciting about watching a prison break, is trying to think of loopholes and methods of escaping along with the character. But I think the prison was too stripped back - to the point that it kinda made it boring.The prison scenes were dull. It mainly consisted of a series of fight scenes back to back, which had minimal contribution to the storyline. (I think Stallone should have gone into the prison a lot earlier. As things were really revived when he came in, and the pace picked up).I left with an overall feeling that the prisoners never outsmarted the system, or found a way to escape from the inside out. It was more that the outside were the main force in helping them to get out.At the end, we never got to see them have freedom... it just ended with them still inside the prison. So it didn't really feel concluded.Overall... I really like the concept of the movie; but I struggle to give it a high rating for those reasons.",

Sure it was disappointing to see two action heroes of the 80s so old but at least it had a realistic premise as well as Jim Caviezel, a very good actor. The escape was also interesting.\nFor this \"sequel\" forget all that! It has no redeeming qualities whatsoever.\nThe scenes were all over the place, it was jumping from one to another without any cohesion. The transitions were so bad for a moment i thought my hard drive was dying! I'm not kidding!\nThe plot was silly beyond belief too. I won't mention any spoilers because there aren't any!\nOh and that CGI... it hurt my eyes every single time. They tried to make it futuristic by having large monitors.... The problem is what those monitors were showing! One had a huuuuuuge text scrolling indefinitely at speeds only Lieutenant Data could read. Most had meaningless rotating geometric patterns! And of course the omg-kill-me-now cliche of the operator typing fast on a keyboard while looking at those rotating patterns!!\nOn a second thought, i will include a spoiler....\nRemember in the first movie how awesomely they found their location by looking at the star positions?\nWell in this god-forsaken \"sequel\" Sly has a transmitter in his ... teeth!.\nOh and it gets better...\nSly's partners remotely hacked the prison via that link in his teeth!\nThey were able to remotely disable the cameras but still had no idea where the prison was!\nAnd there's plenty more ridiculous stuff going on. The operator of the prison communicates with the mastermind behind it all via a huge monitor. A sort of life-size holographic representation of the mastermind occupies the screen. Over the top? Surely but they apparently spared no expenses so why not?... Problem is they decided to distort the voice of the mastermind, you know, that deep voice you hear in witness-protection programs. What was the point of that voice distortion effect when his image was perfectly clear without any distortions?!!\nOh boy I think I've already paid more attention to these stuff than the writers themselves.\nWatch it only if you want to see how low Sly's career has fallen. Don't expect a serious movie like the first part.",

Bottom line is that the story is incompressible, I couldn't care less about any of the characters, the prison itself bears no resemblance to anything even remotely realistic or plausible and seems to have some insanely stupid future technology built into it using physics from a parallel dimension.\nSo if you are of thinking watching this because you enjoyed the first one, save your money go look elsewhere.",

This is the type of movie Dolph or JCVD would have made but not Stallone.Escape Plan 1 had heart, some comedic moments and generally good action and suspense Escape Plan 2 is a flat pan cake with Stallone narrating through out the movie.

Escape Plan 2 is more or less a kung-fu movie for most of the duration and some gun fights and hand to hand combat here and there. I was hoping to see more Bautista since he is second billed after Stallone, but he is absent for the majority of the film not even showing up until the 40 min or so mark.

This felt very rushed when it was developed just for the sake of making a sequel and i was very dissapointed.

            "content": "Honesty I am shocked above all. The first escape plan was such a good movie. Everything about it was interesting, new and unique and enjoyable to watch with a great cast! There is nothing to suggest that a sequel could have done this badly.I don't think it is merely a coincidence that this movie did as badly as it did. There were some very, VERY poor decisions made throughout the movie which resulted in this complete and utter train wreck and embarrassment of a sequel to be produced. I honestly think movies that do this badly are on another level of bad, and the people responsible should be named and shamed and sacked immediately as they are clearly not suited to the movie industry. Sure, everyone makes mistakes, but such an accumulation and frequency of them in such a high magnitude points to a very unsuitable individual in the movie industry. So I had another look into the details to help me understand how this all could have gone wrong.First, let's look at the cast. Yes, some of the acting was dry and bad, but there were 3 amazing actors part of the cast which should have boosted the appeal by a great deal. So why didn't it? Well, it could be because the main and loved actors were barely featured in the movie. Now this could be down to poor writing of the movie but when we look at Miles Chapman's previous works including escape plan 1, they were largely great hits and there were few major problems in his writing that could lead to this being produced. Even with gaps in the movie plots and a poorly thought out scene can easily be amended if the director and other writers have any half of a brain to do so to still transform the movie into something great. We see this all the time and movies are never the same as books, but rather key scenes put together to tell us roughly the same story in a logical and well thought out way.I began focusing my attention on the director of this movie. Some unknown guy called Steven C. Miller. Have you ever heard of him? Nope, neither have I. At first glance, this guy is a 5 foot 5, beerbellied, overtattood man with a terrible track record in the past. After observing his previous works, just one of his movies has scored over a rating of 5/10, and even that was a close call as well. So what were people expecting hiring this man? That suddenly he would produce a masterpiece as good as the first movie when he barely has produced a watchable movie in the past on not even half the budget this movie had? I honestly think this is where the movie goes wrong. Whoever was responsible for hiring this complete clown essentially ruined the franchise from day 1, and seeing the result, I can't be surprised that Steven C Miller cannot cope with such a big movie as this, considering his past works are a complete joke and taunt to good movie directors. The poor efforts and abilities of this man have resulted in a terrible unwatchable tragedy of a movie, and this man should never be allowed to work on a film again as he has proven time and time again of how incapable and how unsuitable he is for directing.In conclusion, I think this movie failed for a large number of factors, but the largest of all, the one which put this movie in the top 100 worst ever movies of all time, was the incapable and unintelligent director (should not even have the privilege of being called one), Steven C Miller, who's terrible sense of directing and track record resulted in one of the most catastrophic failures from a good franchise I have ever witnessed in my life. This man should be sacked and fined for his terrible work, and I think this movie should be remade with the same director from the first movie before you guys go ahead and make the third because this is unacceptable garbage that fans cannot possible ever want, no matter how hard they try to bare it.",

The first Escape Plan was thrilling, it was what was promised. But this movie was so bad that i might consider this the worst movie i've seen. The action doesn't even seem like it's in a cinematic movie, the solutions to the problems are stupid. And it is so fast paced that it becomes weird. Just save your money.",

Why not the rest of his crew which they fought when the captured Stallones character! At the end with the \"big\" fight which lasted about a minute, every single punch was thrown then the camera cut to a different angle, this is literally for every single punch or kick, it was so dark and you couldn't tell what was happening at all.

I'm only 29! What is old days!?)From Stallone you expect always one thing - action, action and action! And a little drama (remember Rocky?). Yes, he can this. But in my heart he always a fearless hero. Besides, I liked another his characters in comedy. But, Escape Plan. The first movie was good. Not excellent, but you have this \"warm\" feelings after film. For me, there are three basis of success: good actors, good story and good atmosphere. And Escape Plan partly has everything. Good actors - well, there are \"stars of 90th\" Stallone and Schwarzenegger. Good story - well, neither new, nor very interesting, but with some charm. Good atmosphere - yes for me.And from second part I expected two things - Stallone and good atmosphere. And... got nothing. The story is very similar to old Plan with some modification. In the centre of plot two Asian brothers, one of which work for Stallone's company. But there no interest for looking at all acting. The actors are washy and their characters are similar. Two pillars of movie - Stallone himself and Bautista, hadn't time and willing to show themself in full force. Sly has a little time maybe of his age. Well, but I turn on this movie because of him! And Bautista... Well, Bautista is Bautista. He is weak as actor and you can use him as one-time characters, such as: \"This is Bautista! Wow!\". And then forgot about him. His best role is in the Guardians of the Galaxy as Drax the Destroyer. This is mean something, if you understand me. The overall atmosphere is weird. Creators thought about future prison as collection of dark with color lights, robots and holograms. But this is more hiding bad fantasy, then showing \"future\". The movie is so \"peaceful\", that showing only minimum of the minimums of blood. You know, this \"piu-piu\" sound and etc. But in the last scene we can look at the beaten face of Sly. Main villain - are your joking?! He is so cute and useless, that you can't perceive him seriously. Sorry, pal. Even plot twist (if we can call it such word) can't help. I expected for trap, but not so big! Sorry Sly, but we can't eat this. Only 2 Sly from 10.",

Miller was directing and my worst fears became true. Escape Plan 2 is nothing more (and surprisingly a lot less) than another of those cash grab direct-to-dvd sequels that has little of what made the original great (or in this case, at least an entertaining action/adventure throwback with two of the greatest movie stars of the 80s and 90s). It's boring, poorly acted and even laughable at parts, but certainly not enough to enjoy it as a guilty pleasure. I would say this is the worst movie Stallone has ever done, but Sly is barely in it. And even when he is on the screen, he isn\u00b4t. It looks like he didn't care, and I can't blame him, even the one-liners he deliver are bad.

I had trouble getting through the movie itself, since it's pace was so non-linear (even though, that can be good sometimes, trust me, this time it wasn't). Sly was barely in this movie, pushed more to the side role in the first half. Even Bautista appearing here and there, with that actor from Desperate housewives didn't help this movie. Script was just so vague. Sly looked like he just had to do this one, for no real reason at all - there's a third part coming soon aswell. I give it a merciful 5, since the soundtrack (retro 80s nuances) and some fight scenes from the begining were alright, 50 and DH dude weren't bad either, but everything else is just bad.

The ending does have a cliff hanger which is upsetting. Its honestly one if those movies you watch one time and that's it. Overall its a decent movie. Can't really hate on it to much.

Dialogue is so badly written that one could watch the movie without any of it, and come out with the exact same understanding of the plot.Unlike in the first movie, where the catharsis is brought by the characters discovering what and where the prison is, the ending here is so lackluster and blatantly set up to be continued in a third, possibly even worse sequel, that it makes this one of the worst movies I have ever watched.

The camera work is so shaky, your eyes will roll out of your head. The lighting is obnoxious. The choreography is useless. There is not one redeeming quality to be found in this movie, not even Stallone.This movie cuts between scenes so haphazardly, it's disgusting. I swear, it's indistinguishable from a parody.

The poster of the film showed only Dave Bautista and Sylvester Stallone, while both of them got very little screen time. The acting from Xiaoming Huang was so bad that I was in a state of serious cringe throughout the whole film. The plot of the film was so dumb and the screenplay was awfully written. The use of special effects was excessive and plain awful. The directing and cinematography was amateurish and showed no skill whatsoever. There is honestly nothing to like about this film.

In addition, the fight which is in first 10 mins has no value.\nThe plot doesn't show us what the exact escape plan of the main character - Shu. The most noticeable and smart part is just after putting a mark in the wall, he knew the structure of Hades was changed randomly. Except that, Shu just self-punished.There is no link between Shu's action: Draw the structure with fairy eyes, know how the prison works but just for fun,Asking Count Zero and put him to the corporal punishment,waiting for the out side help after exhausted and then use his martial art instead of brain to get out although 2 Legions and Akala were killed.\nI heard something likes \"We use teamwork against technology\", oh my god, change it to\"we use hacker,Steven C.Miller's plot and boxing skills against technology\" What is the definition of the author? Argument with brother when everything is likely over or let cellmates die for you?\nPlease,Escape Plan 2,you are better than this,you need to change or replace the name as \"Dramatic Rescue Plan 4,5,6: Jackie Chun, Mayweather and Steve Jobs\"",

So, Pan fell inside her own darkness once again to investigate what had happened when her beloved head worm Hades took over while she was away having a very long and much needed nap.\n\nHades told Pan her demigod kids were overreacting. He had come up with a perfect system of organization, motivation, and a great illusion called \"security\", which gave purpose and hope to all the children instead of letting them mindlessly churn in delusional creativity which was her destructive vice. Didn't she want her kids to be productive and happy? \n\nPan agreed to monitor the children to see if what Hades said was true, and she did witness all kinds of bad childish behavior, and ultimately understood why Hades chose the punishments he did, as he even put a mirror up to Pan to show her when she too deserved such criticism. Pan agreed Hades wasn't evil, but his system of organization caused too much suffering, so she put a spell on the planet to relieve his slaves and let her nature reorganize according to more immaterial planes...like clouds. \n\nOf course Hades was very scared that Pan wanted to move her children into immaterial realms he couldn't control and whined \"My whole Pyramid scheme will collapse!\" as he had control over the rich. Pan assured him \"My spell allows for a very smooth transition of power. Once everyone experiences this new way of living my beloved Hades, you will have much more time to pay attention to your pain-tings and our children will live to share their art with one another which will allow them to enjoy constant transformation.\"\n\nPan kissed Hades and left a love note for the kids \"Don't be jerks, but do enjoy my dark seas. Also, Hades and I agree the Government will be sending out tax bills or withholding and won't mire you with paperwork when they don't have the staffing to handle such antiquated ways of organization. You probably think I wasn't interested in such boring affairs when crafting my future spells, but, you were never supposed to kill Time with paperwork, a huge mistake there. Lots of Love, Pan.\"",

            "content": "Escape Plan 2: Hades: 3 out of 10:  Sylvester Stallone runs a firm that breaks people out of prison. After a job goes bad the team breaks up only to be brought back together when a new secret prison, the titular Hades, threatens one of their own. \n\nThe Good: Dave Bautista is fun for the three minutes or so he is in the movie.\n \nI also like the way the sets are a throwback to the Full Moon pictures of the 1980's with all the neon and bad special effects. \n\nThe Bad: Dave Bautista is the only fun interesting character in the movie. The way he has been arguing with Disney we may see him in a lot more direct to video films like this. His loss is honestly our gain.\n\nThe movie Cube managed a much more effective future prison look on a much smaller budget twenty years ago. I found the sets and special effects hilariously bad. I am not sure the filmmakers really meant that.\n\nThe Ugly: To say this movie's plot makes no sense is an understatement. The futuristic prison contains advanced technology (healing robots, virtual reality etc) that is certainly more profitable to market to the outside world than the current kidnap people and makes them fight so they will reveal the industrial secrets business plan. It is like one of those movies where the bad guy invents a ray that can control the weather and then decided to use it to rob a bank.\n\nIn Conclusion: I have not seen the first Escape Plan but I understand it isn't that bad a movie. Why they thawed out Sylvester Stallone for this junk I have no idea. This is clearly one of those international co-productions meant for foreign audiences. This is not always a bad thing. Bloodrayne is an awful movie filled with international stars but it is also a fun movie filled with sex, violence and hammy acting. This honestly has no action, nudity or violence. Just a bunch of nobodies wandering around a set from 1980's The Apple while some American stars pop in for glorified cameos. More purgatory than Hades I am afraid.",

Like the first Escape Plan movie in which Arnold Schwarzenegger and Sylvester Stallone were the two main actors, Escape Plan 2 tricks you into thinking Stallone and Bautista would be the main actors. Instead you get a convoluted story in which Huang Xiaoming is the main actor playing Shu. The story, however, does pick up 2/3rds of the way through the movie when Stallone as Ray finally joins the prison to help Shu escape. \n\nOne of the biggest differences I noticed right away between the first movie and this second one was the limited budget on explosions. They used way too much CGI, poor at that, to create fire and explosions, which really diminishes the action scenes. I miss the days when Hollywood used actual explosions and real fire (I mean, fake fire but \"real\") to make explosive action sequences. \n\nThere are so many things wrong with this movie, but it's also an interesting story and if you can bypass the awkward scenes and the lack of Stallone and Bautista, it's enjoyable... but probably better to wait until it's free. After watching Escape Plan 2, to me it's no surprise this movie didn't make it to theaters and went straight to OnDemand and Redbox.",

I'm trying to think of a movie that has characters that you care less about, but I can't. The deceptive poster and billing (that Sly and Bautista are stars when in fact they are hardly in it) is not even among the top 5 worst things about this movie. 1) Story is incoherent. No scene relates to the previous one or the next. I couldn't tell you what I just saw, and I was paying attention. 2) Characters are written to not care about them. 3) No clear antagonist. 4) No clear caper. 5) Characters don't behave like real people. For example, *in the middle of a car chase,* the driver calls another character to explain who he is chasing so that the viewer understands the exposition dump. I know that when I pursue someone in a high speed chase, I always ring my bud to inform him of what I'm doing for no reason at all.",

It isn't good, but almost \"Stallone bad\"... almost. The first Escape Plan was enjoyably lowbrow while Escape Plan 2: Hades is depressingly low budget, and hold on to your barf bags because we're facing down an Escape Plan trilogy. The third (Devil's Station) having been shot back to back with part 2... This is not a good sign. Also, Bautista is awesome and I am genuinely shocked by how much I like him as an actor, but his presence here feels nothing short of whorish.",

He could, however, kick and punch his way out of a wet paper bag if that entertains you. The entire film forfeits itself to the so-called success the first one had overseas and it shows. It's a low-rate, crap kung-fu film. This really, really, really sucks. Stallone should be ashamed and embarrassed that he would take part in this abomination. It feels like I got duped and he could care a less that he's putting out garbage like this for his long-time fans. This is just terrible. I hate this movie, and I hate his fake face.",
