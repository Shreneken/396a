            "content": "Sherlock Holmes is determined to capture Professor Moriarty. However, Holmes (Will Ferrell) is an idiot and seems to do his best to help Moriarty escape....and having his devoted partner hung instead! And, in doing so, he's allowing Moriarty's plot to kill the Queen to move forward.One of my favorite comedies is \"Talladega Nights\" starring Will Ferrell and John C. Reilly. And, while not as funny, their film \"Step Brothers\" also makes me smile. So, you'd think that the pair would pretty much a guarantee of a good laugh....though \"Holmes & Watson\" is ample proof that even this duo can make a dud. And, it all boils down to the script, as \"Holmes & Watson\" hasn't a single laugh in the film. Instead, it resorts to the cheap and disgusting...such as vomiting, an autopsy, male lactation, horse excrement, and urination. Most children could write a script funnier than this bilge.The bottom line is that even funny folks need a competent script....and this script is pure crap through and through. Unfunny, mean-spirited and stupid....that's \"Holmes & Watson\". Rarely has a film cost this much and delivered so little.\nBy the way, if you watch this film (DON'T), it's obvious they set it up for a sequel. Considering nearly everyone hated \"Holmes & Watson\" the chances of this sequel are pretty much one in a billion (give or take 10).",

I will now blather on for a few lines.It is poorly written. When I heard the word \"kids\" in the frst two minutes to mean small children, and saw girls in a British public school in the 19th century, I thought I was in for a YOUNG EINSTEIN sort of movie. No, it is sloppily, uncaringly written, and nothing about it gives any impression that anyone behind the camera put more than minimal thought into the movie. There are shots that are out of focus.Ah, you say, but how about the jokes. There is one good gag, in which the Robert Downey movies are mocked: overcranked sequences in which Holmes analyses what a course of action will yield..... only to have his analysis turn out long. This gag is done three times. There are also urine jokes, sexual assault jokes, and other examples of juvenile humor whch are not elaborated, only repeated.I've wasted an hour and a half watching this piece of garbage and another ten minutes writing this. That's more than enough.",

            "content": "I honestly don't hate Reilly or Ferrell. I've seen both of them do fantastic jobs with decent scripts. This film...does not have one of those.Holmes and Watson could have been great - after all, the Sherlock Holmes character, being such a cultural icon, is ripe for parody. But this movie does NOTHING with its premise. In fact, most of the script could just have been copy-pasted from your standard brainless buddy comedy set in modern America, with barely any changes.For one thing, the film has barely any plot - instead, the titular characters simply stumble from one scene to the next, encountering various people of no real consequence (even Moriarty - played by the fantastic Ralph Finnes, a casting choice that would have been so much better in a serious adaptation - is barely in the movie and feels like an afterthought). And sure, not every comedy needs a strong plot; but when you're making a film about Sherlock Holmes, whose very character is built on strong murder mystery plots, you need to at least ATTEMPT to give your parody something of a story.And for another, the jokes are just painful. As mentioned, most of them barely relate to the Sherlock Holmes character at all - they're just standard slapstick jokes transplanted into a Victorian setting, with barely any changes; or else painful attempts at being \"topical\" that'll feel horrendously outdated in a few months. The film makes no real effort to satirise the Holmes character - in fact, it never makes us feel like we're watching Sherlock Holmes or John Watson on the screen at all. Instead, we just feel like we're watching Will Ferrell and John C Reilly faffing around in costumes and putting on dumb accents, and the film never tries to convince us otherwise.It's just low-effort tripe beginning to end. Modern comedy feels like a cesspit sometimes.",

            "content": "Normally, I avoid the movies of Will Ferrell and John C. Reilly, because their typical brand of comedy is a kind I simply don't find all that amusing. But I sought out this particular movie of theirs, because I had heard so many ghastly reviews about it labelling it as one of the worst comedies of all time, and I have a penchant for extreme cinematic disasters. So is the movie really all that bad? Well, there were a small handful of gags that did provoke some (very) mild titters from me, but apart from those moments, I did find the movie to be as bad as other have made it out to be. There are some additional attempts at humor in the movie that COULD have worked with better staging and execution, but they are badly botched by writer/director Etan Cohen and the cast. But most of the humor is so lazy, so familiar, and so predictable, that even the best direction and performances could not milk any positive reactions from an audience. I think an additional problem is that Sherlock Holmes has previously been done to death both seriously and comically that it would require a herculean effort to add new life to the character. All that Cohen can seem to do is stuff like make many modern-day references, showing a real desperateness that will be painfully evident to any viewers. Not the worst comedy I have seen, but it all the same sinks to a real low point in the history of Hollywood movie comedies.",

I laugh with all his movies so I wasn't surprised I did like this movie much more than I'm supposed to when you concider the low ratings. Will Ferrell played Holmes in his typical way, a bit clumsy and dumb but always funny to watch. John C. Reilly was just perfect as Watson, even better than Will Ferrell in my opinion. Holmes & Watson is just another good comedy if you like Will Ferrell's style of humor. If not, too bad...",

Btw ive seen many Sherlock movies and series, saw many Reilly and Ferell ones, always looking like, are they fading... and have seen previous comedies about Holmes, they were not very funny, was hopin when will someone do a good and funny one. But now they did this and they did it, its a jackpot for fans and for them (and to myself).\nOnly complaint i have is about the end. Why the end? When giving so much fun, who thinks about lets end this? This is not normal behaviour and someone should go to see a someone.\nIf you are new to real comedies what can make piss in your pants, dont be disturbed, piss in pants durng a good comedie movie is ok, really, nobody can smell it coz others have piss in pants too.

If you haven't and this is your first time, then prepare to be disappointed because it's just not funny.To put this into perspective the producers knew this was a dog and wanted to sell it to Netflix because they tend to jump at any chance to get original movies. Netflix turned them down because they felt it was too stupid. Netflix turned them down. This is the same company that produced and showed Adam Sandler's \"The Ridiculous 6\".

John Reilly is actually a talented actor (from Gangs of New York to Chicago to The Aviator, and What's Eating Gilbert Grape, and more), so I have to assume the writing and directing on this just were simply awful that he couldn't make this thing NOT stink! Ferrell certainly CAN be funny, but this sure probably was his worst movie yet (and yes.. the guy has had some bad movies.. AND some really funny movies too!)

            "content": "Needing a laugh with the high drama of the holidays, this notoriously difficult critic laughed more than once, many times in fact, with Holmes & Watson. In fact, the absurd humor, crafted by Ethan Cohen and expertly interpreted by Will Ferrell (Holmes) and John C. Reilly (Watson), made me think of Mel Brooks. That's a high compliment.Sherlock Holmes has been imitated scores of times and lampooned almost as many, but this iteration, set in the second half of the 19th century, combines the best tropes (intellectualism, obsession, addiction, to name a few of Holmes's extremes, not even to mention his lack of affect) with satire of said hang-ups and the good old USA (Holmes wears a cap that says, \"Make England Great Again\").In other words, it does a commendable job of evoking laughs out of the Laurel and Hardy playbook (see Stan and Ollie coming soon, also starring Reilly) while it takes a wider look at sexism and chauvinism, finding humor in men who can't abide a female doctor or who moon over a homely queen (Victoria, that is):Dr. Grace Hart (Rebecca Hall): Shall we begin the autopsy?\nWatson: A woman doctor?\nHolmes: Impossible. Fortunately, we have a *real* doctor here.\nWatson: Would you like some heroin?When Watson and Grace perform the autopsy, their desire comes through laughingly at the expense of the cadaver as if they were revising the eating scene in Tom Jones. The riff on an outlandish possibility of America having a president like the one we have a century later is rich with political commentary yet soft as a kitten's coat.Those laughs just keep coming, perhaps none wittier than the extended Titanic motif, obnoxious in its disregard for the lost 1500 lives or that the film is set in 1892 and the fated boat built in 1902. Like the Producers' Springtime for Hitler, it works when by all rights it shouldn't.Moriarty is present (Ralph Fiennes), still plaguing and sharpening Holmes, as well as a Mrs. Hudson (Kelly Macdonald) quite different from the stock housekeeper. See Macdonald in Puzzle if you want an idea of the actress's range.With so many working parts, Holmes & Watson could be a blistering babble of bad humor. Instead, it's just what the doctor ordered for the hefty holidays. A \"real\" doctor, that is.",

Will Farrell's flicks just seem to get worse and worse as he plays the same character over and over again. John C. Reilly is a very good actor who for some reason keeps teaming up with the over-the-hill Farrell. The result was this unfunny, irritating mess. The only good thing I can say about this movie was it was only around an hour and a half. Mind you, an hour and a half too long but still, a short movie by today's standards. This is only the second review I've felt compelled to write but this movie was so bad I just had to tell someone. If I had it to do over again I'd watch \"Planes, Trains, and Automobiles\" for maybe the tenth time.

            "content": "Man I love reviewing the awful ones. Most of what you see these days is alright, competent, good enough that it's nice sometimes to see something so categorically awful - just to get the juices flowing.Will Ferrell is Sherlock Holmes and John C Reilly is John Watson and they ..... (sigh) .... Actually what are they doing? Moriarty threatens to kill the Queen so they ..... follow up on some leads, I guess. Blunder around in a series of ghastly, tedious, scenes and then mercifully it ends. Then (and I swear this is true) the staff at the cinema congratulate you for making it to the end.So why is it so bad? Partially, it's because it has no idea what its core premise is. I wonder if it suffers from being rewritten multiple times since the initial idea with Sacha Baron Cohen. It's never sure whether its Holmes is a genius, a fraud or an idiot - so across the run time he's all three. It feels like the film should have had Watson as the genuine genius, happy for the credit to go to Holmes - but that went out the window when Reilly was cast and now there's no straight man to the pairing, just two idiots tramping from godawful slapstick scenes to witless parody of modern day via a spoof of the Downey Jnr/Jude Law films. It's chocked full of cameos, Steve Coogan, Hugh Laurie and Rob Brydon all of whom add nothing, no humour, no story... just characters coming and going and adding nothing. They do come of better than Kelly Macdonald though, whose cringeworthy version of Mrs Hudson is a particularly and at the end bafflingly, nadir.At no point last year would I have believed that \"Sherlock Gnomes\" wouldn't be the worst adaptation of the character that I saw last year. \"Holmes and Watson\" not only topped that, it was the definitely the worst film I saw at all last year, certainly one the worst of the decade and, without hyperbole, indubitably of the worst of all time.",

I mean the fact that they fell into the same type of roles and antics as Talladega Nights made it unoriginal. Add to that an odd musical number out of nowhere and it kind of leaned toward flop status.I'd say that what saved it were the frequent references to current popular issues such as selfies, women's equality, and our current president.

            "content": "I was tempted to see this film, a comedic take on the legendary Arthur Conan Doyle creation, at the cinema at the time, because I like the two lead actors, they were famously together in Step Brothers, but I changed my mind when I heard all the negativity surrounding it, it bombed at the box office, and was panned by critics, I had to see why. Basically, in 1867 England, Sherlock Holmes (Razzie nominated Will Ferrell), who was constantly bullied as a child, has concealed his emotions and dedicated his efforts strictly to knowledge. One day, he befriends Dr. John Watson (Razzie winning John C. Reilly), after he survived falling from the roof after an attempted suicide, Watson is impressed with his brilliance. Years later, Holmes is viewed as a legendary detective, while Watson does not get much credit at all. Holmes and Watson are to view the trial of Professor James Moriarty (Ralph Fiennes), but they are temporarily delayed by a package, sent by Moriarty, brought in by their housekeeper Mrs. Martha Hudson (Kelly Macdonald). At the trial, Holmes reveals the man at the stand is an imposter named Jacob Musgrave, who is incapable of committing the murders due to tremors in his hand caused by excessive masturbation. Despite attempts by Inspector Lestrade (Rob Brydon) to convince everyone that Holmes is wrong, Holmes is convinced that Moriarty is currently travelling to the United States. After the trial, the duo attends a surprise birthday party for Holmes at Buckingham Palace, where a corpse is discovered inside of a birthday cake along with a message from Moriarty, stating that Victoria (Pam Ferris) will die in 4 days' time. During the autopsy, Holmes and Watson meet Dr. Grace Hart (Rebecca Hall) and the feral Millicent (Lauren Lapkus). Watson and Holmes become enamored with Grace and Millie, respectively. Following the autopsy, Watson declares that the death is indeterminable, while Holmes believes the cause of death was poisoning. Furthermore, he believes that the poison came from Gustav Klinger (Steve Coogan). Holmes and Watson locate Klinger, who is indeed in cahoots with Moriarty, but he is murdered before he can reveal anything else. Holmes decides to seek help from his brother Mycroft (Hugh Laurie), who tells him that the murderer is someone close to him. Holmes mistakenly believes Watson to be the murderer and has him arrested. He comes to regret this decision, causing his concealed emotions to break out. Holmes goes to Watson's cell, but he has already broken out, with assistance from the housekeeper. He tracks down Watson and Mrs. Hudson, revealed to be the daughter of Moriarty, to the launching of the Titanic, where the murder of Queen Victoria is to take place. After apologising and helping Watson, they rush to the main room and discover a bomb, which Watson throws out of the window. The bomb lands in Mrs. Hudson's boat, killing her and her accomplices. The pair are congratulated by the Queen, only for Holmes to defer the credit to Watson. The pair reconnect with Grace and Millie, the latter reveals that her feral personality was an act of manipulation, each pair share a kiss before Grace and Millie board the Titanic. After returning home, Holmes proudly displays a plaque on their building showing that Watson is a co-detective, finally giving him recognition. Later, Holmes and Watson confront Moriarty in a bar in the United States. Also starring Hector Bateman-Harden as Young Holmes, Codie-Lei Eastick as Young Watson, Laura Stevely as Sherlock's Mom, Michael Culkin as The Judge, Wolf Roth as Sigmund Freud, Nathan Osgood as Mark Twain, David Shackleton as Albert Einstein, Paul Cassidy as Charlie Chaplin, Michael Buffer (\"Let's get ready to do scuffle\"), and Billy Zane as himself (a homage to his role in Titanic). It was thought that Ferrell and Reilly back together spelt a sure-fire hit, unfortunately Ferrell turns clever Sherlock into an egotistical, narrow-minded idiot, while Reilly is an equally moronic, very simple-minded inquisitor, and performances from established greats like Fiennes, Ferris, and Macdonald don't improve things. The critics complained that it is badly scripted, the performances are terrible, and it is full of puerile, dated and unfunny jokes, they are completely right, it is cringing, insults the audience's intelligence, and makes a complete mockery of the famous fictional detectives (not in a good way), a rubbish mystery buddy comedy. It won the Razzies for Worst Picture, Worst Director for Etan Cohen (not to be confused with Ethan Coen, of the Coen Brothers), and Worst Remake, Rip-Off or Sequel, and it was nominated Worst Screen Combo for Ferrell and Reilly \"trashing two of literature's most beloved characters\". Poor!",

The humor was hit or miss in the first 15-20 minutes but after that you'll barley have time to breathe between jokes! Will Ferrell did an amazing job as Sherlock Holmes, as he brings a lot of \"stupid humor\" and keeps the character of Sherlock not stupid. John C. Reilly was amazing in the role of John Watson as he had the best character arc in the film. The villain of the movie was good being barely in the film (but making sense in the context of the film) and a very well done twist at climax of the film was not predictable at all! Overall don't listen to the reviews that take this wacky comedy seriously, this was an enjoyable, laughable film.",

If Austin Powers or The Naked Gun come out today, would they get trashed? Maybe they would have back then if we'd had the Internet (well, it was around for Austin Powers, but no so much social media). At any rate, I liked Holmes & Watson waaay more than Talledega Nights or Step Brothers. Maybe I just like the Sherlock subject matter more. Really, it's about the same level of comedy as The Naked Gun; silly jokes, a bit of poking fun at current ideas, and a reference to another famous movie (without being just a parody fest like some that have been compared to Naked Gun). But like Naked Gun, it still had a decent plot with a bumbling detective who figured it out in the end. I also loved the diagrammatic explanations seen from Sherlock's perspective, just like in BBC's Sherlock series. Anyway, if you enjoy any of the silly comedies from the 80s or 90s, don't pass this one off!",

            "content": "It's been ten years since Will Farrell and John C Reilly starred in a movie together. Their previous two outtings not only done well at the box office but are now considered to be classic. This movie must have been something many comedy fans have been waiting for... but what went wrong? I don't think I've read such bad reviews for quite sometime. Luckily or some may say unluckily I went to see it before I read anything about the movie.\nHonestly, I don't think the world needs another Sherlock Holmes spoof, it's been done to death almost as much as spoofing James Bond but I was in the mood for a comedy and this was really my only choice. Comedy at the cinema isn't as easy to come by nowadays I find, so seeing these two guys in a film together again I thought.... it can't be that bad.\nMy honest opinion is... well it isn't that bad. Moments made me laugh, I felt it was paced well and although not as good as their last two movies I felt their fans would get something from it.\nI do however see why people are disappointed. Ferrell's portrait as Holmes, I can seeing being annoying to many, it's pretty crude for a 12 certificate (UK , guessing PG-13 in the US)..Mostly though I think is the advertising of the rest of the cast. Several actors names are on the posters, they appear in the trailer but are barely in it. Steve Coogan has a cameo at best. Fans of these actors will only come away disappointed. If they were unexpected,I think the audience would come away pleased with their appearances. Like when Bill Murray pops up in 'Zombieland' for example.\nOverall it made me chuckle a fair bit, which is the point of a comedy and I can't think of many films that have done thst for me this year. Most of the comedies we get are animated (lately far more laughs in a pixar than in a live action movie) or the odd random film like 'tag' which although a better made film than this, I dont think I laughed more. I do miss the days of looking forward to the latest movies from my favourite comic actors like Steve Martin, John Candy, Chevy Chase and even Adam Sandler. I saw Will Farrell as one of the last of this breed. It would be a shame for this misfired movie to ruin his career. I think in years to come it will be seen as more favourable.\nAlso I couldn't help comparing it to the Peter Cook/Dudley Moore 'Hound of the baskervilles' another bomb with a great cast. Actually I say give that movie a go, you may realise this one isn't too bad after all.\nHollywood comedy seems in a slump at the moment, we either need to not have our expectations too high or possibly throw movies the way of new talent? Maybe both.\nAfter this I'm not sure this pair will get the chance to make other film together. A shame.... who knows though they may need the money and the audience get the long awaited Stepbrothers 2. At least they tried something different I guess, remember the first 'Police Academy' was great but sequels aren't always the way forward.",

            "content": "When you consider the chemistry we know Will Ferrell and John C. Reilly have based on their previous work together, it is almost an impressive feat to make a film this bad starring those two. I've seen some unfunny comedies in my time but it is hard to remember one as terrible as this. Absolutely nothing worked. I kept thinking to myself, what kind of screenwriter wrote this and actually thought it would be funny? How can you think picking up a child's turtle and throwing it as far as you can would ever be worthy of a laugh?Will Ferrell just can not make a good movie lately. He hasn't made a good one since 2010 with 'The Other Guys'. Considering he was undoubtedly the funniest actor working through the 2000s that is quite astonishing. What went so painfully wrong in his career? He doesn't seem to have the same enthusiasm he had back in the early days. Maybe his love of the industry has dissipated, but whatever the reason is he needs to either turn it around quickly or retire because he is seriously ruining his once epic legacy.Even if 'Holmes and Watson' wasn't going to be funny they could have at least put a mildly interesting mystery case into the movie to keep it watchable. But nope, apparently not. A 5-year-old could have come up with the plot they chose to use in this film. I'm not exaggerating when I say this was close to the longest 90 minutes of my life. I have never wanted a film to be over so badly.Were the leads hampered by a PG-13 rating? Possibly, yet that is still no excuse to not even have one funny gag (or even line) in the entire movie. What exactly attracted the two lead actors to take on this project I wonder? Then, as if the film couldn't get any worse, in the last quarter of the runtime they randomly decide to start throwing in some subtle (by which I mean not subtle at all) attacks on President Trump (don't even worry about the film being sets in the 1900s). It is very rare that I ever give a film a rating as low as 2, but there was simply no other option for this abomination. Stay well clear of this one.",

            "content": "Since Sir Arthur Conan Doyle created him, the popularity of Sherlock Holmes as a literary character has never diminished. In his scholarly study, \"The Sherlock Holmes Handbook: The Methods and Mysteries of the World's Greatest Detective,\" Sherlockian connoisseur Christopher Redmond champions Holmes as \"the world's favourite character for English-language films.\" Puffing on his habitual meerschaum pipe and jaunty in his customary deerstalker cap, the renowned detective made his debut in \"A Study in Scarlet\" in 1887. Later, Doyle wrote three more novels, along with 56 short stories. Victorian Era readers discovered Holmes largely in \"The Strand\" magazine. Craving his adventures with conspicuous relish, they clamored for his return after Doyle killed him off Sherlock at Reichenbach Falls amid the Swiss Alps in \"The Final Problem\" in 1893. Many refused to renew subscriptions, and circulation plummeted. Doyle held out for a decade before granting the character a new lease on life. He penned his final Holmes story \"The Adventure of the Retired Colourman\" in 1927. Since Doyle's passage in 1930, dozens of Sherlock Holmes tribute novels have been published. Long after his creator's death, Holmes has not merely survived, but also flourished, considerably in film and television. Inevitably, after more than fifty films, Sherlock's popularity made him a candidate for parody. Traditionally, as the second banana, Doctor Watson has been portrayed either as a non-entity or a nincompoop, while the eccentric Holmes remains aloof, shrewd, and often pedantic. Although film and television treat Holmes with dignity, as a role model, often hushing up his narcotic dependence, some filmmakers have spoofed the sagacious sleuth with a wink and a smile. For example, did anybody watch the \"Gnomeo and Juliet\" sequel \"Sherlock Gnomes\" released in the spring of 2018?The latest send-up of Sherlock Holmes casts former \"Saturday Night Live\" funnyman Will Ferrell as the gimlet-eyed, amateur detective and John C. Reilly as his inseparable sidekick Dr. John Watson. Mind you, \"Holmes & Watson\" doesn't qualify as a comic masterpiece. Unfortunately, the structured material doesn't allow \"Get Hard\" writer & director Etan Cohan much room to improvise. Nevertheless, the farcical humor is often amusing in ways which only faithful Ferrell fans may appreciate. \"Holmes & Watson\" opens with a memorable scene about the youthful detective's first day at school. His classmates bully him without mercy. Eventually, they fool him into kissing a donkey. Ultimately, he gains the upper hand, primarily because he can control his emotions. Afterward, he exposes scandalous things about them which prompt school officials to expel them. Cohan returns to this theme frequently as Holmes advocates brain over brawn. Meantime, Watson's fond desire to attain equality with Holmes as a co-detective. Sherlock dismisses this fantasy out of hand until events compel him to realize how integral Watson is to his investigations. They team up to thwart a copycat of their arch-nemesis, the wicked Dr. Moriarty (Ralph Fiennes of \"Skyfall\"), who threatens to kill Queen Victoria. All along, Scotland Yard Inspector Lestrade (Rob Brydon of \"The Huntsman: Winter's War\") has argued that no copycat exists. Nevertheless, Holmes remains adamant that a copycat has been imitating Moriarty. Indeed, Holmes points out that Moriarty has fled to America and take refuge in the Wild West! Ferreting out this copycat killer turns out to be a challenge.Cohan's irreverent screenplay may alienate purists for the liberties that he has taken with hallowed material. Several scenes in \"Holmes & Watson\" stand out for their sheer hilarity. The \"Weekend at Bernie's\" ordeal when our desperate duo struggle frantically to cram Victoria's unconscious body into a trunk far smaller than her voluminous bulk is hysterical. The ludicrous scene where Holmes and Watson swat each other as a poisonous mosquito flits back and forth between them exemplifies textbook slapstick. When Cohan isn't poking fun at his protagonists, he levels some criticisms about sexual inequality in Victorian England and adds some veiled but sarcastic commentary about the Electoral College and Donald Trump's presidential shenanigans. At one point, Ferrell's Sherlock dons a fez with the slogan \"Make England Great Again.\" Meantime, Cohan has apparently perused \"The Sign of Four\" because he incorporates one of Holmes' signature lines: \"How often have I said to you that when you have eliminated the impossible, whatever remains, however improbable, must be the truth?\" Cohan cannot resist the impulse to lampoon the two Robert Downey, Jr. \"Sherlock Holmes\" epics. Ferrell's Holmes imagines chalk drawings and elaborate calculations in anticipation of a dire predicament, too. Unlike Downey's Holmes, Ferrell miscalculates wildly, particularly when he fails to topple an ogre-like boxing adversary.Comparatively, \"Holmes & Watson\" is neither as hilarious nor as ingenious as \"Without A Clue\" (1985). In that parody, Watson originated Holmes as a recurring magazine hero and hired a drunken stage actor to portray him in public. A lowest-common-denominator farce, with elements of slapstick, \"Holmes & Watson\" surpasses Gene Wilder's lukewarm parody \"The Adventure of Sherlock Holmes' Smarter Brother\" (1975). Cohen sticks to the traditional mystery formula in \"Holmes & Watson,\" except Holmes acts like a witless imbecile. Blundering about with a falsetto English accent, Ferrell plays his typical clueless character. John C. Reilly is just as sidesplitting, but he maintains an imperturbable straight-face. Observe how he holds Victoria's hand discreetly in their scenes together. Ferrell and Reilly were riotous in both \"Talladega Nights: The Ballad of Ricky Bobby (2006) as well as \"Step Brothers\" (2008). Cohan stages all their scenes with an equality rarely seen even serious Holmes mysteries. Surprisingly, Watson is a crack shot with his revolver, and he can pound a giant into submission with a folding chair. Furthermore, he cavorts with their leading lady, Dr. Grace Hart (Rebecca Hall of \"The Town\"), as they perform an autopsy on a murdered corpse that fell out of a huge cake during Holmes' surprise birthday party at Queen Victoria's Palace. Clocking in at 91 nimble minutes, the above-average, PG-13 rated \"Holmes & Watson\" delivers elementary nonsense in varying degrees of lunacy from fade-in to fade out.",

This is the right laugh-out-loud, so-ridiculous-it's-gotta-be-on purpose, make-your-jaw-drop, damn near perfect antidote to the heavy, politically-laden, hysterical-about-anything society we live in these days.It's a humourous take at one of the most iconic fictional characters ever created, who has not only found a place in popular culture for the past 100 years but also weaved itself in popular slang. (Yeah, no s***, Sherlock.)I read a lot of 1-Star reviews with people whining and complaining that they left in the middle of the movie, or they thought it was absurd... Well, that's the point. This movie wasn't made to take Arthur Conan Doyle's legacy seriously. It doesn't even take itself seriously with an out-of-the-blue musical piece that pops out of nowhere. And I stress: that's the point.I've seen a couple of bombs with Will Ferrell that were hard to watch. This isn't one, by any means. \"Holmes & Watson\" miraculously manages to be a witty, at times beautifully-written piece of comedy with an amazing cast, as evident by the amazing John C. Reily (\"Magnolia\"), Rebecca Hall (\"Transcendent\", \"Vicky Cristina Barcelona\") and even Ralph Fiennes, who is brilliant as Lord Voldemort in the \"Harry Potter\" saga.And the reason I mention the audience when I bring up the reviews on this site is because a lot of it is American and a lot of the humor in this British-set comedy is geared towards Americans. And in 2019, America couldn't be more divided in this Trump-era. So I would imagine it's no surprise when a lot of Trump supporters watch this movie and have to listen to jokes about the kind of President they have in office right now: a politically incompetent showman who is also a tyrant and a buffoon. I imagine this deep dig doesn't go over well with a lot of the hardcore pro-Trump audience. Or maybe they don't like the red \"Make England Great Again\" fez which mocks the signature red Trump cap. I would go as far as as saying that what really strikes a nerve is Dr. Grace Hart's (Rebecca Hall) line about women receiving shock treatments to cure feminine hysteria. Ooh, that's gotta leave a mark with feminists. Not to mention the constant \"A female D-O-C-T-O-R?\" remarks by the lead characters. Yeah, I would imagine that stings... in a comedy movie.Or maybe is the reference to American's seemingly m God-given-right to own and use guns. \"They're Americans. Of course they would use a gun\", Sherlock says at one point.But that's what humor is. It makes light of important topics and flips them upside down so one can think about subjects and ideas and even firm beliefs in a different way. It's meant to create an escape from reality and this movie does dances with reality but ultimately is successful at being funny in its own way.Plus, just the crazy amount of thought that went into the lead characters' dialogue is something to behold and applaud. Of course the delivery is over the top. But the point is that Ferrell and Reilly do it SO well. To the point where I was left wanting more. Like, right now.So in a time where most people seemingly become hysterical with just about anything, I applaud the cast and director Etan Cohen for having the gumption to make a satire with a beautiful period production design and comedic timing that will not only make you laugh but ALSO provoke your thought at the same time.And with the British theme in mind, this European says: well done, chaps.",

Peter Sellers is long gone but his spirit lives on in this film. (\"That's not my minky.\")This movie uses the same playbook: satire, slapstick humour and buffoonery. If you try to take it seriously or look at it as insightful social criticism you miss the point. There are so many clever references in this movie that it's hard to keep track of them; Like the elephant man in the waiting room. This movie is a blizzard of gags, anachronisms and laugh at itself episodes. The part where Holmes visualizes how to take out the giant wrestler is masterful; Reminiscent of the scene when Indiana Jones shot the scimitar wielding assassin and poking fun at Roberr Downey Jr.'s Sherlock. This is one of the funniest movies I've ever seen. On the other hand, if you take yourself seriously, you probably won't like it.",

Satire and slapstick abound, the jokes were great and actually pretty clever and well paced.Will Ferrell did a great job portraying a satirically narcissistic Holmes and John C. Reilly did an amazing job at playing a \"never good enough\" Watson. All of the supporting characters were well cast and never felt out of place, or forced and added a great level of humor to supplement the titular characters.All in all, it's a satire by every definition of the word, and if you don't get that, or get offended by everything, stay away from it.

And that sacredness of Sherlock Holmes DOES GET SLAUGHTERED. Bravo! It needed to be slaughtered, to make a fresh new start. To bring back new life to this Sherlock Holmes detective genre, which was nearly bled to death with boring remakes.It is an actor's movie, and I mean that very complimentary. However silly everything may get, there is still lots and lots of good acting to be enjoyed by leading and suporting roles. Ralph Fiennes has a great suporting role and so do many other great English actors.Everything is pretty farcical, but executed with great attention for detail and with marvellous jokes and good acting.Yes, some of the jokes are obnoxious (vomitting, childviolence) but it is done in a very funny way and the obnoxious jokes are only used sparsely.

The film is not as much a parody as it is a cash-in on the relatively recently lapsed copyright associated with the Sherlock Holmes character and his earliest of stories, making for a strange missed opportunity when it comes to where the laughs are (supposedly) coming from. The piece also leaves something to be desired in terms of its story - in particular, the central 'mystery' - and its character arcs, the latter of which are mostly rushed through in a bizarre (and lazy) musical moment towards the finale. I didn't necessarily dislike the experience while it was occurring, but it's almost instantly forgettable and the handful of successful jokes don't exactly make you howl, either. 5/10",

Detective Sherlock Holmes and Dr. John Watson join forces to investigate a mysterious murder at Buckingham Palace. It seems like an open-and-shut case as all signs point to Professor James Moriarty, the criminal mastermind and longtime nemesis of the crime-solving duo. When new twists and clues begin to emerge, the world's greatest sleuth and his trusted assistant must now use their legendary wits and ingenious methods to catch the killer before the queen becomes the next victim.So what's so terrible about this movie? EVERYTHING!!!!!- well, the worst aspect of this movie has GOT to be the HUMOR. Now, if you're the person who likes silly and mentally insane faces as well as dated pop culture references, then this movie is for you. If you don't appreciate those kind of jokes in your SHERLOCK HOLMES movie, then you're normal. Despite taking place in 1800s London, the things that pass on for comedy in this film is (and I'm not joking either) TAKING SELFIES WITH THE QUEEN. Not only does it make no sense because photography back then was absolute garbage, but it's just not funny. When I saw the trailers for this film, I legitimately thought it was gonna be funny! But it WASN'T! And that made me MAD! Another thing that really sucked about this film was the acting. Despite Will Ferrell and John C. Reilly being a great comedy duo, they were EXTREMELY UNFUNNY in this film. Like I said earlier, there's a ton of annoying and obnoxious pop culture references that aren't even funny in the film, and the duo are responsible for bringing in 85% of this messy dump. And you'd think that although there's all these unfunny jokes that there'd at least be 1 or 2 that legitimately worked, but you're wrong! NOTHING IN THIS FILM WAS FUNNY! In fact, the funniest part of the film was the MPAA screen after the film! So the funniest part of the film wasn't even IN it! MY GOD!In conclusion, don't watch this movie. It's horrible in every way. Just don't watch this. There's much better movies that you can get tickets to, like Bumblebee and Aquaman.

            "content": "As someone who considers Step Brothers one of the funniest films ever made, I knew what I was getting myself into when I bought a ticket to go see Holmes & Watson. This was neither going to be Will Ferrell at his prime, nor was it going to be John C. Reilly trying his hardest. However, with the insane critical backlash this one was getting, akin to legendarily bad comedies like Gigli or Chairman of the Board, I almost felt I had an obligation to see this. My Top 10 Worst of the Year list wouldn't be complete without it. In that respect, Holmes & Watson does not disappoint. It's stunningly awful.The best Will Ferrell comedies are the ones where all of the cast members have a genuine chemistry. They're all working and acting together to get the best comedic moments out of one another. Ferrell's presence inspires and rouses his fellow cast members, but he never tries to steal the limelight from them. Here, Ferrell and Reilly are pretty much in a competition to see who can scream the loudest (There is literally a scene where the comedic duo yells uninterrupted at the top of their lungs for a full minute. I recall myself slinking farther and farther into my chair the longer it went on.) The synergy these 2 had in Step Brothers and Talladega Nights is gone; they aren't acting off of each other, they're just trying to be as over-the-top and absurd as possible on their own. And it doesn't work at all.Ferrell and Reilly also seem to have no idea when to just let their jokes end. There are numerous grating, dragging, painfully unfunny running gags present here; one about Ferrell Sherlock vomiting at a morgue, one about Reilly Watson touching The Queen's hand, one about how eating onions like apples is good for your health. Every one of them is a chore to sit through and goes on far longer than it has too. Even a joke about Ferrell Sherlock poisoning Reilly Watson to test his potential as a detective that starts out pretty funny becomes unbearable by the time its run its course, with Reilly Watson giving unfunny poses and lactating his nipples...I'm as shocked as you are they botched a joke that badly.The whole premise is so confused. Sometimes, it wants to play on the idea that Sherlock Holmes is intelligent to a ridiculous, almost nonsensical degree; think the intellectual equivalent of Zohan Dvir. Other times, it's just Will Ferrell doing the blithering manchild act. There's no consistency between it, no actual direction that this character is going towards. Ferrell playing a comedic take on Sherlock Holmes is an admittedly intriguing premise, but my God, the movie has no idea where to go with it.It's also worth noting just how bad the ADR work is. Characters will frequently have dialogue that doesn't match up with their mouth movements, synced in a way that would be unacceptable in a student film. It completely reeks of a total lack of effort with the studio saying \"To Hell with it, reshoots are too hard! Bring the cast to the recording studio to dub over their lines and if it kinda/sorta/not really fits, it's good enough!\"I thought Robin Hood (2018) and The Darkest Minds were pathetic in their attempts at social commentary. That was before I watched Holmes & Watson, a movie that literally feels the need to mention Donald Trump by name (\"You have the electoral college, which would surely prevent some Trump of a charlatan from gaining power!\") This is, of course, after a reference to fake news, Ferrell Holmes wearing a red \"Make England Great Again\" hat and Rebecca Hall's character going off about how America would never elect a \"wealthy tyrant who cares for nothing but himself\" (A line that she, amusingly, seems almost pained to deliver) and this precedes Ferrell Holmes and Reilly Watson explaining how they'd want a \"strong businessman\" and a \"showman\" for President. I swear to you, I was dangerously close to screaming in the theater at this part.There are also times where Holmes & Watson feels oddly Seltzer & Friedberg-like in its comedy, making pop culture references seemingly out of thin air just because it can. In a scene where Reilly Watson has to fight a strongman in the ring in order to arrest Moriarty (Don't ask), Ferrell Holmes, out of nowhere, starts telling the audience they need to \"pay to view\" the event. And then Michael Buffer shows up to kickstart the actual fight. It felt like a cut scene from Disaster Movie and marks one of the worst comedic scenes I've ever watched.Other comedic lowlights include Holmes & Watson taking the first selfie with the Queen, Sherlock Holmes calculating the projection of his piss while drunk, a small child kissing a donkey's behind...It's bad. It's really bad, as bad as you can possibly imagine. I'll confess to laughing pretty hard at Ferrell Sherlock's speech about how Reilly Watson's actions allowed the Titanic to make its first voyage (\"When you think of your friends and relatives on board the Titanic, just remember, Dr. John H. Watson put them there!\") and there are a couple of other moments that are moderately funny (Reilly Watson trying to get rid of bees by shooting them, Rebecca Hall's medical achievements involving exorcising demons, an amusing Billy Zane cameo...Probably some others that I'm not remembering), but nothing that makes this worthy of watching. Stay away unless you need room on your worst list for one more movie.(All that being said, I still hate it less than The Incredible Burt Wonderstone and Bad Teacher.)",

            "content": "All I can say about this film is that it was absolutely terrible. Sure, every few years they attempt to redo the Sherlock Holmes story, and some of them are actually pretty good. The problem with this one was that it was trying way, way too hard. In fact it tried so hard that it completely fell flat on its face. Sure, maybe I was attempting to compare it to the Guy Ritchie version that appeared a number of years back, but honestly, even if I put that one out of my mind, this film still would have been incredibly bad.\nIn a way it is supposed to be a comedy, but as a comedy I found that it was just so not funny. Sure, I may have laughed a couple of times, and there were a few chuckles coming from people in the cinema, but a part of me would shake my hand and wonder what it was that they found to be funny. Okay, they did actually use that famous 'no s*** Sherlock' phrase that has since come into our collective consciousness, but honestly, it would have been so much funnier if it was muttered in Infinity War when Iron Man and Doctor Strange were both on stage at the same time (apparently they were going to do it, but decided against it).\nIn part, it is supposed to be that Holmes is a bumbling fool, and that Doctor Watson is actually the smart one - except it doesn't work. Well it isn't even like that because Watson comes across as stupid as Holmes was at times, and it didn't even work that way. Oh, and the whole 'Dr Moriarty isn't Dr Moriarty' didn't work as well, and a part of me was surprised that Ralph Fiennes stooped so low as to even appear in this movie despite the fact that he did very, very little - maybe he was just a little too expensive.\nYeah, honestly, this is another one of those films that I would highly recommend that you completely avoid because it is a complete and utter waste of time. Then again, it did mean that I could catch up on a but of sleep, not that I really needed it, but then again it was so bad, and so boring, and so incredibly silly, that I would have had a much more productive day if I had just stayed in bed.",

Reilly have excellent timing and really held the film together. Other reviewers on here have complained that the jokes were telegraphed as if that was a negative; I felt the fact that they were telegraphed made them all the funnier because we were in on the joke that these two were so clueless as to not realize what was going on. For example, when Holmes and Watson take turns slapping each other in the face to try to kill a mosquito. The timing is superb! With straight faces these guys slap away obvilious to the fact that they are becoming Moe and Larry Howard from the three stooges.OReilly's reaction to Holmes' \"disguise\" is uncommon in its sincerity. Watching Holmes create Watson's disguise is a hoot if you are not a stuffed shirt.Some of you maybe needed a cocktail to let down your walls.

The film currently sits at 6% on Rotten Tomatoes and at one point had the dreadful honour of being completely at 0%.Watching it confirms the fact that it is entirely rotten. Which is an absolute shame. Will Ferrell and John C. Reilly are comedy greats and usually together their humour is multiplied...but clearly the problem lies in the script and direction.Both duties fall under Etan Cohen, not to be confused with Joel and Ethan Coen and definitely not to be confused with Joel Cohen, writer of Garfield. Of all the Coen/Cohen's in Hollywood, we've found our Paul W.S. Anderson equivalent.Previously the filmmaker behind Ferrell vehicle Get Hard, it's amazing to see someone get worse, particularly this worse.Holmes and Watson has all the trappings of a Sherlock Holmes story and all the trappings of a potentially great comedy handled with the grace of the Running of the Bulls through the World's Largest China Shop. So inefficient and unfunny, it's definitely not great when you look around at the silence caused by the severe lack of jokes in the minutes before the opening credits (except one person in my screening, but there's always gonna be one intergalactic alien trying to fit in as a secret human).The film is severely bland and lacking, full of choices that seem completely misguided. Ferrell decides to put on a strange accent for Holmes that doesn't work at all, and Reilly's Watson is overly and unfunnily violent, yet these are choices never dissuaded by the director, which is concerning.Holmes and Watson has a story, if you can believe that, one where Moriarty (played by the criminally underused and probably overpaid Ralph Fiennes) has a presence, but is harshly pushed to the side in favour of an invisible antagonist you can figure out by spoilers by billing.On a completely unrelated note, Kelly MacDonald is in this movie and she continues to be brilliant and brilliantly Scottish in the things that she makes, and while her character is there for a bunch of anachronistic jokes and pushed to the side too, when her arc thins out it feels like it was a good idea made sour at the drop of a hat.Somewhere, in this movie, there is a joke. I guess. I hope. Much like A Million Ways to Die in the West and other films of that ilk, the only thing that made me laugh was a heavy reference to a much better film that had humour in the fact it took you completely out of the movie you were watching, because it's safer.Holmes and Watson is a hollow entry to round out the year of comedy movies. Alan Menken and Glenn Slater offer the second closest thing to a joke with an original song that's a parody of their work that's nothing compared to Vanelope's \"I want\" song parody in Ralph Breaks the Internet.Everything in this movie has been done better and bigger and funnier and smarter. Hell, even the overrated later episodes of BBC's Sherlock itself parodies itself better, even down to a drunk Sherlock scene that doesn't have to stoop so low as this movie does for an attempt of a laugh.It joins a bunch of movies I would give no stars to if I could, but the sheer fact that somehow this movie made it from conception to the silver screen is some sort of commendation. Plus it has a Titanic joke that makes no sense, but it makes more sense than the entirety of the film.And before you say something, yes, the majority of jokes in this film are indeed out of time. And out of this world.Which is not a good thing.1 Star.CJ",

The consequence of hollywood's success dilutes the global culture as post-American.

This is very 21st century is the streamlining of brand. With its 'wearing of hats' as identity exchange which is transient about appearance selling the lie. The product is always the same it's just different hats. Like Taco Bell the same food across one hundred items on the menu but in different shapes. Holmes's convolutions were so frequently wrong but his associative non-linear thoughts were consistent with his brand, so still viable by the societal forces. \"It's Holmes so it must be right.\" Apply this to everything and we have the vessel for complete societal failure.

I think we could see more of these slapstick films from this comedy duo if they'd cut the budget down a bit, like quiet a bit. I'm pretty sure these guys can maintain the physical humor without all the C.G., just make these films to have fun and entertain us all the while still making a few bucks for the studio in the process. If you had ever had the pleasure of listening to the audio commentary by Tim Conway on the Private Eye's DVD you'd understand where these kinds of comedic duos are coming from. They really enjoy making these movies for their fans, and I for one like the way these two guys play comedy off each other.

Nevertheless, the eccentric detective of Scotland yard gets another revisit this holiday season, this time with a much more comedic direction than most versions tend to focus on. Can the legendary comedian team that gave us Step Brothers, step up to a new relationship? Robbie K is here to share his thoughts on the another review as I take a look at the film:Movie: Holmes and Watson (2018)\nDirector:\nEtan Cohen\nWriters:\nEtan Cohen, Arthur Conan Doyle (Sherlock Holmes and Dr. Watson were created by the late) (as Sir Arthur Conan Doyle)\nStars:\nWill Ferrell, John C. Reilly, Ralph Fiennes\nLIKES:Quick Run Time\nFunny At Times\nReferences To Other Versions\nSecondary Character Was Funny\nThe SongSummary: As the reviews come in, you are seeing a lot of negative components, but I can say that despite this not being everyone's cup of tea, the movie at least is short, running around the 1 hour and 20-minute mark, meaning you'll get out of there fairly quickly. In this short film, the movie manages to find some nuggets of well-timed lines that somehow held some wit behind the bantering. Often for me it had to do with the references to other versions of the detective, with nods to the Robert Downey Jr and Benedict Cumberbatch creations that are super popular. When it comes to these moments that is the component that I found the most entertaining. Well that and the secondary character of Millie, whose simplistic bouts of nonverbal comedy had some of the better time laughs than either Ferrell or Reilly could drum up. Of note though, the little song number that Ferrell and Reilly get to perform had some zest to it, so I give them props for including that.DISLIKES:\nPaper Thin Story\nMystery Was Boring\nLazy Writing\nToo Forced Of Humor\nMissed Comedy Opportunities\nFixation on Banter\nDiving Down Politically Heated Topics\nSummary: Holmes and Watson's first weakness comes from the paper-thin story they tried to sell with the comedy antics. A very simplistic tale that tries to throw in shallow character development and a mystery, this version certainly did not focus its efforts on trying to have something to ground the comedy too. The mystery itself is lackluster and overshadowed by the ridiculousness of the film and given the obvious answer as to whom is the culprit, makes for a plot that will have difficulties standing up to the law of good movies.\nOf course, most fans of Ferrell may not really care or expect the story, because he is after all known for being the king of slapstick, banter, and inappropriate comedy. While this movie follows that formula, it's writing did not quite match the quality of other Ferrell flicks and not just because of the missing story. Holmes and Watson had trouble finding its stride, forgoing classic one-liners for mindless banter and arguing between the titular characters, or extended bouts of over the top slapstick that didn't pack the punch the scenes sound effects had. It was comedy that was too forced for me, the lines blunt displays of stating the political injustice we still complain about, which doesn't have the intended prowess it wanted. When those styles failed, they switched to the obsessive self-pleasing jokes that although had good chemistry between actors, again treaded down the gross pathway instead of the funny for me. And the worst part is, all of it is in forced accents, the characters pushing into overdramatic displays of emphasizing the words in very forced accents. All of this boils down to work that either has grown too stale to work in the modern age, or was too forced and lacking the finesse earlier films held.The VERDICT:Holmes and Watson's trailers have not sold you any lies, it's a mess of predictable plot antics with overzealous comedic attempts that the two are famous for. Yet the film does not have the same quality that the duos first film had all those years ago. Is it because the comedy is stale, or is the focus on being too forced of comedy? I don't know the answers, but there is some serious need for plot development and better-balanced comedy to assist for any future installments. As such, the movie missed its mark on a lot of things, needing to step back to the clever tipoffs, and timing than overstuffing the film with comedic banter. Thus, I can't recommend this one for the theater, encouraging to hold out until Netflix picks it up. Sorry guys!My scores are:Adventure/Comedy/Crime: 5.5-6.0\nMovie Overall: 4.0-5.0",

They make a great team in this, with some real belly laughs resulting (the accents especially made me guffaw - pronunciations reminiscent of the Gendarme in Brit sitcom 'Allo 'Allo!)\nThe plot is satisfying with a couple of neat surprises and a really good ending/coda.\nIt's exceedingly silly, knockabout fun.

I don't get what all the hate was about. Sure, there are some pretty dumb moments, but I was mostly laughing throughout. It's basically a silly/slapstick comedy, which is clear from the trailer.Also, I didn't see any of the \"sloppy editing\" and \"shots out of focus\" that's listed in the trivia, and I don't get why people would have walked out en masse as claimed. I've seen far worse.All in all I don't know what people were expecting, but if you liked Farrell and Reilly together previously then you'll likely enjoy this as well.

I think the duo did a great job giving the serious and intriguing series that so many of us have fallen in love with. I thought it was constantly funny and Will Ferrell brought a very heartily feel to the otherwise dark and impressive detective that is Sherlock Holmes. I was laughing several times during this movie and I was able to watch the whole thing without walking out. I had not even one single thought of leaving this movie. It was totally worth the money and if they made a sequel I would have no problem paying the money to see this again. When it comes out on DVD, I will definitely get it again to watch. I appreciate everyone else reviews to this movie but I definitely give it a way higher review than that! I give it a 7/10! I think you guys should give it a try too!!!",

I am a huge fan of Step Brothers and it is my favourite movie of all time. In my opinion, Step Brothers was made to be hated but people didn't take it seriously and they loved it.I'd like to think this was the same idea that went into the creation of this masterpiece. The main reason everyone is hating on it is because they took it too seriously. I went into the theatre with the mindset that this movie was going to be horrible and unfunny. I absolutely despised the first 30 minutes because I came in with that mindset.But then I thought, \"What if this movie was intentionally made to be horrible? In that case, it would be hilarious!\" And that suddenly changed my outlook on the entire film. I thought that the political jokes about the American government weren't made to be funny, but make the viewer very uncomfortable which I found hilarious.A movie like this isn't made to be liked, I mean they are spoofing a universally loved franchise and tarnishing its reputation. This incredible piece of cinema was made to make fun of the people who took it too seriously, just like how Step Brothers did.So go into this movie with the mindset that Will Ferrell and John C. Reilly are making fun of the people who give this movie a 1-Star review, and you will have an incredible time. If that wasn't their intention then yes, I'd probably give it a one star, but they've done this in the past with Step Brothers, and they likely did it again with Holmes and Watson.While it's not as unintentionally incredible as Step Brothers, it is a lot better than people say f you go in with the right mindset (don't laugh at the jokes, laugh at how bad the jokes actually are). <-- that was the intention for this film",

The un-funny gags were telegraphed so badly you couldn't help but see the mediocrity coming, and when the gag came and went while the theatre went silent, I'm certain I've got allies in my review. I'm really disappointed because this movie could have been terrific and side splittingly funny but it missed badly at every level.My biggest gripe, however, was what seemed to be an entire movie made so the writer, Etan Cohen, and others I'm sure, could go political. What a total s**t show. I go to movies as an escape, to enjoy my self, and to take a break from reality. Frankly I'm more than a little bothered having spent my money so Etan can tell me about his politics. I may or may not agree with him, but that's not the point. Do you see my point?There's no spoilers here other than to say this is the worst movie I've ever paid to see; it's political, and I doubt there is anyone on screen I'll bet supporting again.

Arrogant is one thing (he may or may not have been like this or close to that), but the fact he was made to look as though he wasn't smart (to put it mildly).Having said all that, there is more to OuaTiH, something that can hardly be applied here. Because you have quite the silly and really quite questionable depiction of two beloved figures. Not because the filmmakers don't like them, but because they wanted to do something different.And boy is this different. Predictable still and quite the rude humor and a bit dull for some for sure. It's tough to see merits, like the amount of good actors involved in this in smaller roles.

It featured the classic comedy duo of Will Ferrell, and John Riley, and was hysterically funny. I will admit some of the jokes there were corny, or broke the 4th wall, but i personally find that funny. Even then the movie in and of its self was great. I guess it's no great Gatsby, but instead a comedy based on the original work of Sherlock Holmes. Honestly I think this was one of the better movies i have ever watched.",

I genuinely mean WTF?!?.\nMade in similar style and 'homage' to the Guy Ritchie Sherlock home movies it clunks from one scene to another with all the finesse of a bulldozer trying to make a house of cards. If I was Guy Ritchie, I'd sue the film makers for every penny. Some genuine talent appear in this movie (Hugh Laurie, Steve Coogan, Ralph 'Commander Waterford' Feinnes) and all I can say, it must of been one hell of a big payday for them, because they would never be associated with anything this awful otherwise.\nIf you watched this high, you'd struggle to enjoy one minute of this gosh awful, stinker of a fetid vomit stained movie. It makes the worst of the worst budget movie made by film students, with no budget, no talent and no skill, look like 'Citizen Kane'. Please, please do not watch this movie.

Watson's character is no better and it left me sad to see these two characters turned into fools for the sake of a couple of cheap gags. As the years have gone by I keep finding myself discovering that the newer comedy is not as funny as it used to be. It seems daft to me the attempts that comedians go to make the audience laugh these days. Homophobia, misogyny, drug abuse and physical abuse are not funny-in fact these things are crimes-but for some reason Hollywood insists in shoving this garbage to the viewer.

When he has some decent material, you can count on him to be funny (the movies I mentioned above, Stranger Than Fiction) but if there's a crappy script or nothing to build off (Get Hard, The House, Daddy's Home 2) he just flails around and embarrasses himself.

I don't like to blame actors and actresses for a movie's failing, especially when its evident they didn't have material to work with, but this movie falls so flat it is embarrassing and nobody elevated themselves beyond the material.A lot of the material for the comedy isn't period accurate, there's jokes around things like selfies and outright allusions to Donald Trump (which I normally would have laughed at, but it was too obvious). That's okay but they contrast that with decent looking sets and costuming to make the movie relatively accurate to the setting in time. This movie had a decent budget and they put it to good use. It makes the movie seem off and pulls the movie out of the decent work that the set designers, makeup artists and wardrobe did.With all this complaining, you might think I'm a Sherlock Holmes purist or offended by the idea of a parody of Arthur Conan Doyle's work. This isn't accurate, I really dug the Robert Downey Jr. version of Sherlock Holmes and the Benedict Cumberbatch/Martin Freeman show. These characters are ripe for a comedic take but Holmes & Watson reeks of improv comedy. That can work but this probably wasn't the right property to do that with. This movie also does every gross-out joke including one where Watson is lactating from poison. Again, gross-out humour can work but it needs to be done with some tact and this felt like just pandering to the lowest common denominator.By the halfway point I was embarrassed to be in the theatre watching this. I'm not above admitting that I chuckled a few times, mostly from jokes delivered by Rebecca Hall and John C. Reily but this was probably the worst movie I saw this year. The stuff that falls flat doesn't just awkwardly hit the ground, it burrows into it. I was hoping that Ferrell and Reily working together again would break Ferrell's recent streak but that didn't end up being the case. Avoid this at all costs whether you're a Sherlock fan or not, I'm giving this a 3.5/10 rounding up to a 4/10.",

            "content": "Holmes & Watson (2018) offers a few genuine laughs, but they are overshadowed by groaners and misfires. To the film's credit, it attempts to find humor at various levels and in various forms, from subtle situational irony to physical burlesque. One viewer's groaner may be another's belly laugh. For me, the fool-triumphant gags worked best, while the most tedious were the clumsy political commentaries and the homoerotic humor. The anachronisms were misses more often than hits, although one involving a camera and another a telegram were amusing. The movie tries too hard to make Sherlock Holmes into Will Ferrell, rather than making Will Ferrell into a caricature of Sherlock Holmes. Neither ever becomes sympathetic or likeable, as do Johnny English and Inspector Jacques Clouseau. The opening scene, where they meet, presents both as unlikeable with no chemistry between them. For that matter, none of the central characters comes off as particularly likeable.Part of the problem is that Watson (John C. Reilly) becomes the protagonist, while Holmes becomes a comic sidekick for much of the film. Watson's character arc is more akin to that of a protagonist. Often in adventure films, the sidekick saves the hero. Here, it is Holmes who must rescue Watson. Watson also does much of the hard lifting in defeating the villain.Some elements are allowed to go to waste. The Baker Street Irregulars are often present, but don't do much of anything. Usually, there is a character who realizes the protagonist is really a buffoon, such as Commissioner Dreyfus and Bough, but H&W has no straight man, other than Inspector Lestrade, who seems more frustrated with Holmes than in on the joke.Production values are excellent. The actors are talented and do as well as might be expected with the material they're given. Writer/Director Etan Cohen has been involved in funnier and more entertaining projects, including Tropic Thunder and Men in Black 3. He was also writer/director on Get Hard. Despite occasional laughs, much of H&W simply isn't funny.",

You may see other reviewers on here denouncing the movie as mindless, plotless and crude, and they're actually not too far off the mark. As far as plot and moviemaking goes, this is no masterpiece. The real appeal of this movie is the hysterical comedy. There are some fantastic political references, some hilarious set pieces, and in general just great comedic moments. The reason most people detest this movie in my opinion is because they were expecting a Robert Downey Jr-esque take on Sherlock Holmes, in that the movie is serious, well-plotted and articulate. Well, what I say to these people is, you've literally got dozens of Sherlock Holmes films to watch for these qualities. What the director of this movie has done is thought outside the box a little, taken a vastly different take on Sherlock Holmes than the endless amount of filmmakers before this. This is a rollicking comedic ride, with the lack of plot more than compensated for by the consistent laughs that you get of it. People don't laugh enough anymore, and it is for this that this film is well worth the watch.",

Reilly's brand of comedy. Sure, they're fine when they've worked separately on something seriously clever (Ferrell in \"Stranger Than Fiction\" (2006), e.g., or Reilly in \"Stan & Ollie\" (2018)), and even their other picture teamings can produce a few laughs from me, but this one is a complete dud. Perhaps, Adam McKay (who directed the other Ferrell-Reilly movies, but not this one) is just a better director than I suspected. Regardless, together, Ferrell and Reilly are like the Abbott and Costello of today: broad slapstick, juvenile banter, flat jokes, and probably better off on TV. I imagine Abbott and Costello may've done something similar with the material of Arthur Conan Doyle. Strip the source of what made it interesting in the first place, pretend anachronisms are funny on their face, add an unimportant romantic subplot for no good reason, revel in regional differences between people (in this case, Americans and Britons) and, when in doubt, act stupid. Maybe if McKay did this one, the timing would've at least been better, or maybe the digs at the gimmicks of the Robert Downey, Jr. versions of Sherlock Holmes would've been amusing.There's a rich tradition of parodying detective Holmes and his stupid friend, surrogate author Dr. Watson, but you wouldn't know it from viewing \"Holmes & Watson.\" And I have no plans to see the also-panned \"Sherlock Gnomes\" (also 2018) anytime soon... or anytime, really. One of the earliest in film history, if not the first, was the 1916 silent short \"The Mystery of the Leaping Fish,\" which stars Douglas Fairbanks. In it, Doug effectively lampoons Sherlock's drug habit (as opposed to here, where the mere mention of \"cocaine\" is supposedly funny) while, ironically, employing his detective skills to thwart drug smugglers. I recommend seeing that over-100-years-old film instead of this soon-to-be-forgotten bore.",

Reilly) are assigned to investigate the perpetrator of Queen Victoria's (Pam Ferris) future death on the Titanic. The murderer is their housekeeper Mrs. Hudson (Kelly Macdonald), who is a descendant of Dr. Moriarty (Ralph Fiennes), but don't expect me to analyze her plan because the movie doesn't care. Holmes & Watson is nothing but a barrage of predictable slapstick, insultingly deadly sexual jokes and painful meandering Victorian versions of modern-day references. Not to mention, there's an out-of-the-blue song sequence written by Alan Menken, who probably cashed his big paycheck for a pension fund and must have been ashamed penning such garbage. As for pop culture references, we get numerous allusions to Donald Trump's America, mentions of Fourth Wave feminism, and a cameo from Billy Zane at the end. Speaking of, the most insulting anachronism of all, aside from the drunken telegram sexting and the selfie from the Queen, the RMS Titanic was constructed in 1908 and launched in 1912, several years after Victoria's death. Not only that, the ship sailed not in London but in Southampton, tens of miles away. I know it's pointless to rag on a movie with nothing but comedic anachronism, but the Titanic ship is intentionally part of the storyline, one set in the nineteenth century where most Sherlock Holmes stories take place. Holmes & Watson is not only a downfall for Will Ferrell and John C. Reilly's careers, but also an insult to history, Arthur Conan Doyle's legacy and comedic intelligence.

I'm in full agreement with IMDb voters on this one, a 3.8 rating as I write this is about what the movie deserves. At least John C.

Reilly) discover a plot by Holmes' archenemy Professor Moriarty (Ralph Fiennes) to assassinate Queen Victoria, the unorthodox detective only has 4 days to prevent his rival's plan from occurring. But in order to do that, he must seek help from his brother (Hugh Laurie) as well as a female physician (Rebecca Hall).Relying solely on humourless anachronisms to propel its overly simplistic story, this is not the first comedic take on the darling detective, but it is certainly the laziest and most cringe-worthy adaptation.Incidentally, crime scene investigation was so rudimentary in the 1880s that most murders were blamed on solar eclipses.

Initially when this was announced, was looking forward since having enjoyed several of Will Ferrell's work and along him and John C. Reilly which made Stepbrothers a classic. Then once the trailers came out, we could see that the film didn't look too funny but keeping a positive outlook we perhaps thought they were saving the best for the film.As a whole this film isn't funny in the least and is quite forced at times. The slapstick doesn't really work here and the jokes don't hit. For being a supposed mystery film, there weren't clever jokes and the payoff in the end wasn't worth it. At times rather boring.Perhaps not completely bad but this may be a new low and a serious career killer for Will Ferrell. After the House (2017) flopped and was panned, this film was supposed to be the step back in the right direction but as it turned out, Holmes & Watson was an even bigger flop and received worse reviews. We don't know how many more chances Ferrell will get but if he isn't careful, his time may sadly be coming to an end.Fast forward to several years later and we may be looking back and ask ourselves what happened to Will Ferrell's career, and this film may be the answer to that question.",

They are obviously are not following the news about the country of France rioting in the streets screaming for their President to be ousted and replaced with the American President.Producers should have known, but will soon find out just how sick of this drivel the American people and World is. Will Ferrell and company embarrassed themselves on the world stage ripping their home country. It's like listening to someone making classless jokes about their wife for 90 minutes with her sitting there, it's boorish, uncomfortable, and most certainly not funny.I predict this will not recoup it's investment, and that you will not see these \"comedians' and their 'director' in any main stream movies for awhile. They will only find work doing voice-overs because losers are not bankable, and producers, the ones that paid for this, DO NOT like losing money.Walt Disney said, why sell two tickets when you can sell four with a G rating. They wanted increase the amount potential buyers. 80% of America was married with two children. This production crew has reduce their possible of sale to 15%.

Did Sony really think it was a guarantee to win with these two? Talladega Nights is so good (I like the extended version better) and Step Brothers is one of the most quoted films of all time. But that doesn't mean every film with them is going to do well. Even if this film came out five years ago I don't think it would have helped.I'll admit I enjoyed the first trailer. Then the reviews came out. Then that infamous time when the film had a 0% on Rotten Tomatoes. I never trust Rotten Tomatoes but that's hard to get out of the head. Could the film be as bad as the word of mouth? Yes, it can be. I actually think it might be worse.Farrell and Reilly star as Holmes and Watson. They are tasked with protecting Queen when a new threat emerges as classic villain Moriarty has fled to America. Goofiness ensues, but goofiness started the film and finishes the film. This is not a direct parody of the Guy Ritchie film but it might as well be. There is a running gag of Holmes strategizing specific situation before he takes actions. It gets old after about the second time.That's the issue with the film. There are about five jokes that are recycled throughout the film. Most offensive is the joke about women doctors when Rebecca Hall and Lauren Lapkus show up. Every time they show up it's \"you are women, you can't be doctors\". Even five years ago this joke wouldn't be funny. Ralph Fiennes plays the Moriarty role in what plays out like an extended cameo. Steve Coogan also has a useless cameo. I'm not sure if Farrell just asked some friends to be in the movie or they were actually cast in the film.Most of the film features current jokes or somewhat current jokes played out in this time period. There is a one the nose joke about the political climate today, where one of the characters nearly breaks the fourth wall to stare into the camera to tell the audience something. It's not creative, but obvious and needless. I don't know if the creators thought the audience would be so stupid they needed to be beaten over the head with ideas. The film gives off the aura that they wanted to make a Mel Brooks type spoof film. But the film comes off in the laziest spoof of all time. With the talent around the film, it's not disappointing but more embarrassing.Holmes and Watson is a predictable, jokes that all fall flat film, that I think Sony just dumped to get out. The rumor is that Sony offered it to Netflix and they turned it down. That's pretty rough if Netflix who usually takes everything turned down an offer to stream the film. That's not a good sign at all. This is definitely the worst film for the duo and might go down as the worst film either of the main actors has been in. There is nothing redeeming about the film. No saving grace and silvering lining to actually venture out to see this. (Even if it was streaming, I think most people would have only watched it to see how awful it as)",

The 16 minutes I watched, and there is no way to prove this, I feel like I lost brain cells as well as valuable time I could have spent watching, or even doing, something more productive.Will Ferrell needs to take a long break, and Ethan Cohen needs to stop offering to direct the horrible films he's been in lately. Where's the funny Will Ferrell? Did he die and get replaced with this unfunny, messy version of him? Adam McKay needs to stop producing his horrible films and start writing and directing them for him again, even then I don't really know if Farrell can even pull it off anymore. It's sad, because I loved Will Ferrell as a kid with films like Talladega Nights: The Ballad of Ricky Bobby, and even Step Brothers. I want the Will Farrell who could pull off a role like Buddy in Elf. I don't think he could ever repeise that role as he is now.",

The location was drab and boring, the supporting characters weren't any better, and sadly, my two guys didn't even appear to be trying.There were about two gags I enjoyed, one when they shoot at the bees, and I can't even remember the second one, I just recall laughing twice. I have enjoyed a lot of stupid movies, but this wasn't even stupid, it was just dull.I have been waiting for this specific movie for a while, ever since it was rumored to be taking place with Sascha Baron Cohen. I even used my limited movie pass to see it when there are a lot of other movie options I'm waiting to see.The two stars have got to be for the two actors, just because I can't count them out, without partially blaming the writers and the director, but they are getting by on the skin of their teeth.",

What sucks the most is that the set is great, the costumes are good, the music is actually incredible, but the writers and the actors were all apparently horribly ill while writing this, because it is nothing but an absolutely horrible fever dream from start to... I'd say to finish, but my girlfriend and I walked out as soon as we hit the \"morgue scene.\"Will Ferrell and John C. Reilly were so funny in Step Brothers, because they played stupid versions of themselves. Here, Will Ferrell uses a downright offensive British accent, and the directors apparently thought that this would be humorous in itself? This is the only explanation for why anyone thought this movie was funny, because the \"jokes\" are certainly not funny.It's like a bad SNL skit that went on for an hour and 30 minutes too long, because there is one joke the whole time, and it never lands; Holmes and Watson are stupid. This doesn't even remotely make sense, let alone make me laugh. I chuckled once. Ok, twice. But I got nothing more than a \"heh\" out. Otherwise, this is not even a film to be laughed at. As soon as Will Ferrell came on screen, I leaned over to my girlfriend and said \"Oh my God... is this going to happen the whole movie?\" I didn't finish it, but I'm pretty sure it did happen the whole movie. That's what I saw.How many more times do I need to say it? I LOVE stupid Will Ferrell comedies!

Reilly-Kong:Skull Island, Step Brothers; Rebecca Hall-Professor Marston and the Wonder Women, Iron Man 3 and Ralph Fiennes-Spectre, The Grand Budapest Hotel.\nThis is a very bad movie. It's dumb, silly, political and down right unfunny. I'm not a big fan of Will Ferrell. He is funny sometimes and not so funny other times. This is one of those other times. It's written and directed by Etan Cohen, who had a hand in Get Hard, Men in Black 3 & Tropic Thunder-I don't know what he was smoking or drinking but he must have been blitzed when he wrote this movie. I even heard that after disastrous screen tests, Sony tried to sell the movie to Netflix but they declined. There were a lot of walk outs in theaters during the opening day showings, too. I was tempted myself but I like to give a movie a chance, in case it gets better-but no such luck here. Anyway, Will plays Sherlock Holmes, the great English detective created by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle and John plays his trusted confidant, Doctor Watson. They are trying to save the Queen of England from being murdered by Ralph, who plays the villainous Moriarty. Rebecca is an American doctor that becomes a love interest for one of the heroes-and if you guessed Will, you would be wrong. I read that it's based on an SNL sketch that Will starred in, back in the day. There are a few cameos but they don't help much. It felt like they were doing the cameos because they owed Will a favor or something. One of the many political jabs taken involved Will putting on hats-one of them said, 'Make England Great Again'.\nIt's rated \"PG-13\" for violence, drug references, language and sexual material and has a running time of 1 hour & 30 minutes.\nIt's definitely not one that I would buy on DVD. I wouldn't rent it, either. Even if you are a big Will Ferrell fan, I would wait until it comes to cable tv.",

When you have the names Ferrell and Reilly side by side again, that should be enough to draw a huge crowd. Unless word spreads that your movie is a complete pile of crap, which this absolutely was.

It was written terribly, the story line had too many characters that weren't properly introduced, there was audio issues with words being spoken and mouths not moving, the accents were bad and weren't funny, and the movie had too much political bs in it.But my biggest issue was the political statements made in the movie. I don't care if you're Right/left/middle when it comes to politics...movies, especially comedy, is what people use to escape. An evening to just relax and have fun. This movie was used to poke fun with an agenda that some agree with and some don't agree with that had literally nothing to do with the plot or story line. Pathetic.My favorite comedy duo has seriously let me down. This movie wasn't comedy, it was garbage.",

            "content": "Recently there appears to be a trend of surprising films, surprising not in their content necessarily but in their ability to defy expectations, much wasn't expected of Bumblebee however it turned out to be a solid\nenjoyable film, Spider-man into the spider-verse was met with scepticism due to its ambitious plot and peoples strongly held views on past spider-man cinematic efforts however it turned out to be a truly excellent film whereas with Holmes and Watson one could expect another run of the mill guilty pleasure if not great Will Ferrell comedy maybe heightened by the impressive skills of John C. Reilly instead it was one of the worse comedies nae films in recent memory failing to be funny or entertaining or even bearable for that matter.About here I would probably be expected to write a synopsis of the film I will do this but I am going to keep it brief as just recalling this films contents causes my blood to boil. Will Ferrell stars as Sherlock Holmes an incredibly gifted private inspector. He is accompanied by avid admirer and assistant of sorts Dr Watson played by John C. Reilly, Together they must catch the bad guy in order to prevent the death of the Queen.Holmes is one of my biggest problem in this Film more specifically the inconsistencies in his character. When it suits the plot he is a self and Watson assured moron who fails to see obvious clues and happenings however one moment later and he holds the abilities expected of classic Sherlock Holmes finding the most subtle of clues and saving the day not to mention he is incredibly unlikable but not in a love to hate way or comically flawed way more in a oh shut up and go die way.I could pinpoint many other flaws within this film but the vast majority of these are flaws for the same overriding reason that makes this film so poor. That not only does it rely almost solely on worn out comic tropes and ideas but it fails at executing them instead falling flat without fail every single time.This is a truly terrible film that I would not wish even upon my worst enemy, do not pay this film the respect of your time or your money. Trust me its really bad it will sadden you, it will dampen your belief in cinema and it will lessen the quality of your life in the same vain that it has lessened the quality of Planet Earth simply by existing within it.",

However, I only laughed once during this entire movie, and I forced myself to do so. I really wanted to love this movie, as I have loved everything that Will Ferrell has put out. I even found ways to call Zoolander 2 enjoyable. But this was painfully unfunny. I can only think that Ferrell was somehow contractually obligated to make this picture. As excited as I was to see another Ferrell and Reilly \"masterpiece\" (Talladega and Step Brothers are both in my top 10), I really hope they find another script worthy of their talents and chemistry.

He simply resorts to the odd Ferrell-esque shriek which comes off as just desperate. It's a painfully damaging blotch to the Ferrell brand.\nAs for Coogan, Lawrie and Fiennes - they all feature very little (and presumably since have collected their pay checks, run for the hills and will claim they were never involved - I would).Seriously, who wrote this?

It's not shocking anymore, it's not edgy to make fun of him... it's just pathetic. We go to movies to escape from all the political nonsense and yet here it comes... and not even in an entertaining manner.2. The dig at rich white guys. Again, we get it... Hollywood, a town of rich white guys, hates rich white guys. Again, another pathetic attempt at social commentary which falls flat.3. The story absolutely sucked. It started out bad, and just got worse. I've taken more creative dumps than this movie. I kept waiting for something to happen and it never did.4. The acting was absolutely atrocious. Ironically, Ferrell and Reilly can actually act when they want to, but this movie was just garbage and gave them nothing to work with.5. The jokes were incredibly stupid. Not even funny stupid, just stupid. There were a couple of scenes that had a brief moment of humor, but it was shockingly brief.6. Shoehorning Billy Zane in at the end? What was the point of that?I literally left this movie angry. It was a complete waste of time and money, I stayed til the end hoping it would get better and it never did. It deserves every ounce of hate that it receives. And if you think this movie is funny, good or entertaining, I have to ask how much the studio is paying you for a good review, how you sleep at night and what is your actual idea of good entertainment.Avoid this movie like the plague.

I cannot say that any of the anachronisms worked comedically and to my mind they were an annoyance that added nothing to either the characterisations or the plot, for example, transposing The Titanic to the Victorian era was quite simply, totally pointless to any aspect of the movie and had no comedic value at all so, why do it?I expect this movie will feature strongly at the next annual Raspberry Awards and I would not be at all surprised if, in time, it becomes a cherished cult film in the manner of 'Plan 9 From Outer Space' and 'Attack of the Killer Tomatoes'.",

Unfortunately this was not the case.The movie was very slow paced. This movie could have been easily done in 65-70 minute run time however they decide to throw in filler for 80% of the film.The trump jokes, while somewhat funny, we're kinda lacking any connection with the story at hand. What does Sherlock Holmes have to do with 2018 pop culture and politics?The fight scene in the movie with the Perrenal WWF Jobber Braun Strowman, looked about as out of place as Arnold fighting the Big Show in \"Jingle All the Way\". More Robert Downing Jr Ripoff during this scene with the math equation \"that didn't work\".The one doctor being a cat had no place in the storyline. What was her purpose other than standing there? Why cast that role in the first place?There was only 6 people in attendance for the film. 3 people walked out leaving me and my friend Joe and some random woman towards the front. I then started to pull out my dab pen to try and stay focused on the film. The final scene with Morarity dying the way he does and Sherlock saving his friend Watson that he had betrayed and accused him of killing everyone was very lackluster. A musical number made no sense hereOne F bomb the entire film. Clearly a phoned in performance by both men. Will Ferrell might be on the down slope ala Jim and Adam.",

It is almost brilliant how well the film falls flat so often, and seems most of all to serve as a reminder of how truly awful some comedies can be when you have screenwriters and actors who hardly seem to try. Though he is hardly in the movie, Steve Coogan as the films suspected tattoo artist seems to be the standout in the film, and is the only chuckle-esc moment the film has to offer. The acting is nearly horrible, and terribly on the nose. The film can never decide what it wants to be, how insane it wants to be, how it wants to act, or where it is going. The only positive thing it really has to offer, is a surprisingly fitting setting and set pieces for the background, though in the end some fitting pictures are hardly what makes any film worthwhile.\nMy Rating: 2.5/10",

This morally bankrupt Gang of Ghouls delights in mocking our Beloved USA Heroes, including Uncle Sam, Robin Hood, and--now--Sherlock Holmes. This wretched, raunchy, rotten riot of excessive poor taste gobbles up any glimmer of good will with gluttonous glee, as it glories in dragging down even Leader Trump explicitly by name with frequent anachronistic citations.

I find that some of his most recent films like THE OTHER GUYS and THE HOUSE are very funny (maybe not as funny as ANCHORMAN...but what is). I think this comedian still has his fastball.But, sometimes, wine doesn't age well, it turns into vinegar. And for Ferrell, this vinegar is the comedic dud that is HOLMES & WATSON.Partnering with familiar on-screen partner John C. Reilly (who paired with Ferrell in films like STEP BROTHERS and TALLEDEGA NIGHTS) this film is a parody of the multitude of Sherlock Holmes films - this time showing that not only is Holmes and idiot but so is Watson. But, somehow, they manage to solve the crime and save the day anyway.Ferrell is (typically) over-the-top and obtuse as Holmes. Usually, this combination works for him (see ANCHORMAN) but it just falls flat here. Same thing for John C. Reilly's Watson - he is just as over-the-top and obtuse and (I think) that's the beginning of the problem here. The two just bounce off each other without the joke landing on either of them - nor does it land of the audience.Ralph Fiennes (Moriarty), Rebecca Hall (potential girlfriend), Rob Brydon (Inspector Lestrade) and Kelly Macdonald (Mrs. Hudson) all fair poorly with poor material to work with.Writer/Director Etan (that's Etan, not Ethan) Cohen (IDIOCRACY) does nothing to help things here with either his writing or his direction. My only thought here is that he thought that Ferrell and Reilly could improvise themselves into a good film.It didn't happen.Letter Grade: C (because I guffawed out loud - despite myself - a couple of times)4 stars (out of 10) and you can take that to the Bank(ofMarquis)",

Top notch cinematography, set design, costumes and acting talent. They even had former Akron Devo band member Mark Mothersbaugh write the musical score.

Following loosely along with the latter Holmes tale concerning the ever present villain Moriarty, THe ffort was there, yet at times the pacing felt off and the acting of everyone present was not good enough. Opinions vary on so many matters, and speaking personally the combination of Farrell and Riley was not the best duo I have ever see, but this movie was in my mind, again, due to the effort therein, at least better than the pile that was step brothers. I really was so bored with that film. Again, the comparison is not meant to make one think this film is that worth paying for, and it felt kinda hollow after the movie was over, and that the film had been more of an filler for the 3rd real Sherlock moive that Robert Downy Jr just hasnt been able to make cause of the shackles marvel/ Disney has on him. BEen a while since I saw a flick that NEEDED nudity in it, but then pg 13 films these last couple years have been a monumental disappointment, so its no surprise. Trying to boost viewership with a lower rating, only hurt this film the more. Personally I liked it enough, but still have to give this film a 5.5/10 ( 5)",

Sherlock Holmes as a comedy doesn't really seem like a good idea, but this movie is the worst possible scenario.All the comedic bits can be 20 seconds to 3 minutes long, and they are just so repetitive, stupid and pandering. Like in the trailer, the leads try to take a selfie with the queen, and they do platypus lips and stuff, I don't want to remember. Thing is, the people making the movie are too lazy to actually get the camera to take a picture, so they just get Sherlock and Watson to whack the queen with it. After that, they think the queen is dead and it's just minute after minute of them being idiots. Nothing changes, there's nothing clever about it, no one in the theatre laughed at it. That scene was pretty much the entire movie in a few minutes. If you found it funny, I guess I'm happy for you. Me and everyone else who watched it with me in the theatre got little from it.There's the music as well, which is just annoying pop music that doesn't fit at all with the time period, characters and sometimes what the characters are doing. It's just there so the audience can recognise it. I don't know if it was meant to add to the comedy, because I think it detracts from the tiny slither of comedic value the movie might have.I'm glad that Will Ferrell is getting a lot of money from being in these awful 'comedies'. But, if movies like this keep being released then most people will be burnt out on this. I hope those who keep making these movies have some kind of change of heart, or just anything to get them to stop.This movie is horrible.",

            "content": "I am a huge fan of the earlier Will Ferrell and John C. Reily films Talledega Nights and Step Brothers with the latter being one of my favorite comedies of all time. Around 2018, there were rumors (but only rumors and not even good ones) about a possible sequel to Step Brothers. When I saw a trailer showing clips from Step Brothers, I was estatic. And then I was dissappointed..... Not because it the trailer was bad (and it was) but rather because I would rather have had a sequel to Step Brothers rather than this film. Holmes and Watson was released on December 25th of 2018 and the film was pretty much panned by critics and audiences. I could not tell you how many stories I heard of people walking out and stories of what movie theaters did in response to this movie being a pile of garbage. Though, I tried to keep an open mind. It would not be until nearly two years after this film's release that I decided to buy this film on DVD and watch it. Was it a waste of seven bucks? Perhaps... but at least I have the Holy Trinity of Will Ferrell and John C. Reily films.The film follows Sherlock Holmes (played by Will Ferrell) and Watson (played by John C. Reily) who are investingating a murder that happened at Buckingham Palace. All kinds of dumb stuff happen and well.... that is pretty much it.I honestly try my best to give a brief description of the film without making it sound bad, but this film does make it very hard for me. With that being said, this movie is bad but bad in the way that an Adam Sandler movie is bad. It makes me laugh, but only due to it's absurdity. Nothing is really clever about the humor at all and the only way that one can somewhat enjoy it is by taking your mind off of everything else and just focus on the movie and at least keep an open mind about what you are watching. I did exactly that. I am not mad for watching this film. The comedy is fairly strange. First thing that this film opens up with is a fake Hannah Montana quote. Due to it's absurdity, I laughed at it. This film does that a lot where it makes references to things today. The only problem is that this film takes place in the late 1800's and it is a problem when this film decides to have the Titanic in it. Wow..... great job movie. Clearly, this movie was not made for the intellectuals. Some of the jokes drag on for a long time and there are pointless scenes that add nothing to the story other than to make an attempt to make people laugh. Nothing is really memorable about this film. Will Ferrell and John C. Reily give a performance that is bad and honestly it feels like they improvised all of their lines. Stuff like this was funny in Step Brothers but in here, it is not really funny. Will Ferrell plays the worst Sherlock Holmes ever and that might be the joke here. For a smart guy, Sherlock Holmes is really dumb. Sherlock Holmes stories in general are supposed to make your mind think and here, there is no mystery. There is not even a big focus on it in my opinion. When the \"mystery\" is solved, it is not very satisfactory and it is dumb. Professor Moriarty is supposed to be a very smart bad guy in Sherlock Holmes stories and he is not used at all in this film. Which just makes the ending even dumber. I will go ahead and complain again about how modern references are in this film. The whole soundtrack is your typicall bad rap hip hop music that is in every bad comedy. Ugh...Holmes and Watson is a bad film. It is far from being the worst comedy ever (films like the Larry the Cable Guy movies are such examples). I would not even say that it is even close. Rating it a two would mean that the film made me laugh once and I laughed more than once. So a three star rating shall suffice.",

Reilly, Rebecca Hall, Rob Brydon, Ralph Fiennes, Kelly MacDonald, Lauren Lapkus, Steve Coogan, Pam Ferris, Hugh Laurie, Michael Culkin. (PG-13)Broad, anachronistic comedy version of the relationship between Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's indefatigable characters Sherlock Holmes (Ferrell) and Doctor Watson (Reilly); here they try to solve a rather pedestrian murder mystery and assassination plot against the queen. A scattering of laughs in the hit-or-miss early-going, but they dry up quick; far too many dated gags, lame contemporary references (selfies, MAGA hats, \"Unchained Melody,\" etc.), and uninspired slapstick routines sour the experience. Cohen's script is especially lazy, using puerility as a crutch and even botching a Billy Zane cameo. The stars are typically funny together, but they don't even try to play actual characters here (no matter how thinly-defined), and settle on being vaguely dumb, pompous and socially awkward; the supporting cast is littered with talent but they're largely wasted (Lapkus hardly even gets to speak until the denouement). Not quite as awful as initially reported, but still not worth anyone's time.32/100",

Reilly's reunion, but surely it couldn't be as bad as everyone was saying, surely these two seasoned pros wouldn't allow themselves to be a part of such a dire and comically bad misfire?Sadly all the bad things said about this genuine dud from director Etan Cohen (who somehow managed to make a film worse than Get Hard) are true, our dreams of Ferrell and Reilly teaming up and mining comedy gold shattered, by a film that fails in all of its intentions to create a crass, innuendo filled Sherlock Holmes adventure that would have audiences chuckling into their popcorn or rolling around the isles in fits of laughter.There could be an in-depth analysis of why Holmes and Watson is such an epic failure, from a lactating Reilly, horrible miss-uses of comedy legends and fine actors such as Steve Coogan, Rebecca Hall, Kelly McDonald, Rob Brydon, Hugh Laurie and Ralph Fiennes and other various cinematic crimes but at the end of the day, you can't help but feel a lot of the films failings fall at the feet of Ferrell and Reilly, who should've known a lot better.No doubt it was great for the two to reunite and spend some quality time together but after creating such a strong repertoire and chemistry together in their hit film's, it's hard to imagine Ferrell or Reilly would've felt good about what they were producing on set each day as their timing is flat, their performances devoid of any creative spark or imagination, instead falling time and time again for an easy gag that may at times raise a slight chuckle or wry smile but mainly just induces cringes and rolled eyes.It's a terribly sad state of affairs witnessing two performers we know can do better flail about in Cohen's lifeless and charmless exercise, making Holmes and Watson not only hard to watch but hard to fathom, questions now must be asked around the fact that is this the last time we see Ferrell and Reilly on screen together? Dashing hopes many had of seeing the long talked about Step Brothers sequel.Final Say -Aside from a few very minor chuckles and tiny moments of potential, Holmes and Watson is a film deserving of its extremely low reputation. Tarnishing the on screen partnership between two of the modern eras most likeable comedians, Holmes and Watson is a crime against cinema, that isn't worth investigating.\u00bd an autopsy out of 5",

Reilly is a head-shaking disappointment (and yes, I know John C. Reilly has an uncredited role in the second Anchorman movie, but I don't count that). Though the film has its moments, they are very few and very far in between. Ferrell and Reilly come off as stumble bums in their roles ... not funny, and not invested.The film starts with a small segment showing Sherlock Holmes as a young boy and the bullying he received from his classmates, causing him to become the emotionless, yet intellectual giant that he was. Okay ... so far, so good. Not a bad start. Enter Ferrell as the modern day Holmes and Reilly as the modern day Watson - and almost immediately, the movie deflates with antiquated gags and jokes that hardly raises an eyebrow. It falls upon these two to root out a conspiracy to take the Queen's life and discredit Holmes at the same time.This movie fails on so many levels and was truly a big disappointment, especially considering their previous work together which was fresh and funny. In this film, Ferrell and Reilly seemed to be more concerned with trying to make things LOOK funny instead of just letting them BE funny. Staging and posturing is the order of the day - nothing flows naturally in the movie. It is completely stilted and forced. The script is terrible, the jokes are old and just plain bad.This is not a recommend. In fact, I would recommend for you to pass on it. If you are a die hard Will Ferrell or John C. Reilly fan, then I can understand your wanting to see this - as I wanted to, even though it was receiving bad reviews. This is one of the worst movies that either of these two have ever made - and certainly the worst one that they've made together.",

It has a silly tone to it much like any Ferrell movies. It simply has a lower budget but if you like that kind of humour you will probably like this. It's not simply a funny movie it's a pastiche of Sherlock movies. And it works. It takes aim at the Downey Jr vehicle and when it does these scenes are hilarious.\nDespite it not being a big budget movie the cast has UK comedy royalty. It was also great to hear a genuine Scottish accent by Kelly MacDonald of trainspotting fame. This movie will probably play better in the UK than the US due to the acting talent involved.\nThere were some complaints this was anti-Trump. It's clearly not. There is one part where they joke about the electoral system but of course this applies to any elected president. The jokes are neither pro or con any political side, so to suggest this as a reason it's a bad movie is completely false.\nIf you enjoyed other Ferrel movies give it a go, it's not big budget by any means but as a parody of Sherlock Holmes movies it works very well. It's elementary that some of the hate is from Sherlock fans who do not like their hero ridiculed. Decent despite the negative hype.",

Pfft, I mean either you hate films like this or take life too seriously, as watching films is a hobby where you have to switch off & enjoy! The reviews here are overwhelmingly negative & make the film sound a lot worse than it actually is!My review on the film is honest, so here goes:I thought the film was alright, not amazing, but alright for what it was. It wasn't boring for starters. A 1 hour & 25 minutes, this film had a decent enough story-line a decent amount of laughs (which were quite funny) & a decent amount of action in which it parody's Sherlock Holmes.I did however feel the laughs were few & far between, with some parts not being funny at all. The story wasn't anything special but what do you expect from a film like this anyway? It's a comedy. It's meant to be a parody so why go in expecting a masterpiece? The film wasn't & isn't as bad as everyone & these paid reviewers are saying. The film is pretty good, but not amazing.This film I think is a great way to end 2018 & I don't think it should be considered the worst film of this year. It's not THAT bad!So I give this film a fair rating of 5/10. It deserves a watch at least once! So go in with an open mind & don't read reviews before going! It's better to have your own interpretation of the film & not someone else's!",

I did laugh 2-3 times early on, although I was still trying to be optimistic, and I'm not totally sure they were truly earned. Having Ralph Fiennes as Moriarty sounded like a stroke of genius, but he has maybe 3-4 minutes of total screen time.Anyhoo, if anyone reading this is tempted to go just out of curiosity whether it can really be that bad, it is.

They have always played off each other so well and it's been a while since the two were cast together. So, what went wrong with this?To start off, there have been a lot of \"Goofy Detective Duo\" films but I'm not sure that the screenwriters have ever watched any. If I had to choose a classic example of how to do this style of film right, I would have to go with \"The Private Eyes\" (1980) starring Don Knotts and Tim Conway. There has to be a balance of humor, mystery and thrill. This film has made a terrible error of trying too hard to be funny while totally neglecting the actual mystery. The mystery is the driving force of the film and without it you are left with a lot of goofy behavior that goes overboard turning comedy into awkwardness.Don't get me wrong. While I am disappointed, Farrell and Reilly still know how to play off each other and I did see that a few times. It is good to see them on the screen together and I hope that the trip up of this film will not dissuade them from trying to make another film.The takeaway is that this film is a fail. I hate to say that. I'm sure there will be plenty of folks who enjoyed it but it didn't work for me. :(",

Like when Watson was in morgue with the lady spoofing the Clay sculpting scene from Ghost. The vomiting part at morgue was prime example of how Will ferrell forces things. It wasn't funny and as i watched i wondered \"does anybody laugh when he does this stuff?\" The concept of making Sherlock holmes a comedy may work, but without will ferrell! I dont want to hate him but his style of comedy is the type i avoid. It's almost like three stooges, as they used abuse on themselves to get laughs. Stop forcing comedy. It wont work. And if you force it, make it look effortless.I feel bad for the people who went to cinema and paid for this! Lol.What do i find funny? Crude stuff like family guy, American Dad's Roger the gay alien, SILENCE OF THE LAMBS lotion scene! Lol! Seriously! \"RUB THE LOTION ON IT'S SKIN!\" Funniest movie line of the 1990's! Well, of 1991 or whenever that film was released. Will ferrell has never been funny to me. Im half black so maybe that's why. It seems only white liberal types think he's funny. Same white liberals who love the office which IS NOT FUNNY! The Office is not funny! Who told these stale, corny white dudes they were funny?! My toilet sees more comedy than they make!WHO FINANCED THIS TERRIBLE MOVIE?! So many QUALITY film concepts never get funded but THIS JUNK GETS MONEY?! Again, what fools gave money to this?! How does junk like this keep getting made but quality gets denied?! And the idiots running hollywood expect me to be a sucker and pay to see this?! I dont even want to watch for free! I cant watch this whole movie. I cant! 40 minutes into it and i'm DONE! If ROWAN ATKINSON were cast instead of Will ferrell, IT WOULD'VE BEEN HILARIOUS! Will ferrell doesn't understand comedy! STOP GIVING HIM MONEY! Stop encouraging this unfunny, forceful style. It's not funny! HE CAN'T EVEN DO AN UPPER CLASS BRITISH DIALECT! He's a \"professional\" and has money, gets paid and can't pay for dialect classes to get that dialect?! I can even do it and Im a Half black American from the South!

This is like discounting the movie before you even begin watching it which means you won't enjoy it. Don't get me wrong its not the best newer comedy but it's far from the worst comedy to come out lately. Don't be a lemming make your own decisions forget reading reviews especially critics reviews as you can pretty much count on any negative criticisms foretold by the critics as probably a positive thing for the typical movie fan as those guys call the most boring dramadies and comedies hilarious. I see other people comparing it to older movies to them I say times have changed its not the 80-90's anymore get over it and all those comedians have pretty much dropped off the radar.

And I understand that this is a comedy and is not supposed to be taken seriously, but the humor doesn't make up for it. Imagine stepbrothers except less funny, mixed with the prior two films, mixed with the scary movie franchises, that's what you get with this movie. Is what it is, if your a fan of a less funny Anchorman, then enjoy. My advise, skip it, you'll have a better time at the BMV.",

If you were expecting it to be one then that's not a good idea at all!I remember coming out of the cinema thinking \"That wasn't nearly as terrible as everyone was making it out to be\" and quite frankly, it's no way near the bottom of my 2018 movies rankings.

I mean did they even watch Sherlock Holmes (2009) starring Robert Downey Jr. and Jude Law? They were more like those characters. Doctor Watson in this movie was just pranking around. Not a good acting.\nThe plot was terrible as well. Everything was jokes, even when Holmes accused Watson of being guilty was like a joke too. The song to rescue Watson was worse. The references in here were not good: Albert Einstein and Harry Houdini? Why do they have to be in this movie? This is the United Kingdom!!\nNothing was special in the scenes, but the jokes and humor were okay. Other scenes were really boring. From the start to finish, it was always terrible and a mess.

            "content": "I somehow missed this when it came out and did not remember hearing anyone talking about it. I saw it was running on TV recently and recorded it. Tonight, I decided to give it a go.This film begins with a young Sherlock being left off in the schoolyard by his mother about the age of 6 in 1867. He no more than enters the schoolyard when about two dozen other children descend upon him, physically roughing him up and even taking his pet turtle he brought with him (seriously, who brings a turtle to school on his first day?) and firing it off through the air bringing about a panicky scream from the terrified young boy.The next scene sees the turtle with a complete body cast beneath his shell, and Sherlock is sitting by himself in the same schoolyard. This time the kids all approach and say they are sorry and that this girl they know he likes wants to kiss him.Sherlock is so dumb he lets them put a blindfold on him as they lead him across for his kiss. He is startled moments later to learn they weren't sorry and that he has just kissed a donkey's rear end, delighting all of the others. He is so hurt that he is \"un-crying\" according to what someone in the schoolyard says. The narrator says he decided right then and there to have no feelings for anything or anyone, but to just devote his life to science and catching criminals.After seeing a montage of newspapers with many photos from the 1870s about this great boy detective, newspapers that are totally not like those in that time in history, we come to 1890s London where Professor Moriarty is on trial for murder where we are told that Holmes is about to appear with the evidence to convict him.But at his apartment, Holmes is prattling about with John Watson who keeps reminding him they need to get to the courthouse because time is running out on his chance to testify. Instead, Holmes takes forever picking out a new style hat to wear-sporting all sorts of stupid hats including one saying \"Make England Great Again\"-giving us a modern-day injection into the time of a century ago. We know the judge in the trial has told everyone that Moriarty will go free at exactly noon-just minutes away-if Holmes doesn't show up.We spend more time than was left on the courtroom clock with Holmes trying on hats, then going after a deadly mosquito that Watson released by opening a box that was delivered to the flat. Watson just couldn't leave it for later knowing they had to rush. This led to a silly Keystone Cops-like slapping sequence where the pair practically kill each other slapping and then hitting with heavy objects each other as the fly goes from one face to the other.Finally Holmes is able to kill the mosquito who rested on the side of a huge case of deadly bees he was keeping in his room. He appears to have only killed the bug, but moments later, the glass side of the bee case breaks open in a million pieces-how that happened is a mystery to me-and releases thousands of these deadly creatures into the apartment.Moriarty is always portrayed as Holmes's biggest adversary and any depiction of him having a chance to put Moriarty away for murder would surely have seen the great detective camping out in the hallway of the courtroom to make sure nothing prevented him from being there. To have him risk everything just to model a dozen different goofy hats for Watson? Just painfully stupid and out of character.Most Three Stooges movies showed the characters behaving in ways that made more sense. Here Holmes is portrayed as a moron too stupid to heed his colleague's admonition to leave now to get to the courthouse. Opening the package that was just left instead of waiting for later at a time when hustling to the courthouse was imperative was also moronic.But when he started lining up the cricket bat to clobber the mosquito on the side of the bee case, I started saying I cannot take much more of this. When the glass shattered half a minute after he barely tapped it, with his scientifically measured perfect swing getting the bug and not the glass, I said \"That's it. I cannot stomach any more of this.I see nearly half of over 1,000 people on this site have given this film the lowest possible rating, convincing me that I was wise to quit while I wasn't quite nauseated. Believing that high a percent cannot be wrong, and knowing that I just sat through 10 minutes of the most idiotic script I have ever seen, I feel justified in joining the others in giving this thing a score of one.Since I am honestly reporting how much of it I watched, I think this acceptable. Never before have I reviewed on IMDB a film I didn't see all of. If, years from now, it is on and I don't remember it, I can check the website and see what I wrote tonight, allowing me to avoid another huge mistake. I think I'll go find a Basil Rathbone, Nigel Bruce Holmes movie to help me forget this incredible waste of movie film.",

Bullet Train is too busy cramming in elements of other genres to be interesting for much else.Maybe, if you've seen the other Ferrell-Reilly movies, you found this stale and predictable too, but then if you've seen the other movies and don't like their style what were you doing watching this in the first place?Onion and Bullet kept me entertained, but Holmes and Watson was the only one to make me laugh.",

The very fact that this film has a very pronounced woke character makes this whole situation not only stupid but also unwatchable in lot of moments. I'll be honest, maybe it's my fault, maybe I expected too much from the film, I thought it would be something more, something actually funny, because here the biggest emphasis is literally on comedy at least that's how it's presented to public, but unfortunately I couldn't find a single scene that would make me laugh, the jokes are somehow forced and clich\u00e9d to make matters worse and poorly presented.

(I LOVE Almost Heroes, rip Chris Farley).\nAnyway, personally I would not pay for it if you know what I mean (we rented it on demand for $12, I told my husband if it sucked he had to give me $10). It didn't suck, it wasn't great, but it was decently silly and it has a great musical number in it. And lots of nonsensical anacronisms like music that didn't exist yet in the late 1800s, and the Titanic setting sail from England. Part of the charm.TLDR: if you like Will Ferrell and John C Reilly you'll like it enough :) I wouldn't pay over $3.99 for it though if you're renting it. get a firestick & teatv app using a VPN.",

This movie also makes fun of the era it takes place, it makes fun of society, it makes fun of USA -- in short it makes fun of anything I find funny and it manages to do it in funny way and I can't find many things funny. Like I watched back to the future movies for like 20 years a lot of times and only like few days ago I learned it's supposed to be a comedy movie. I never actually had an idea it could be a comedy movie loljust the opening scene in which kid sherlock gets bullied therefore he cries while a lot of kids around him laughing at him and then as a coping mechanism he uncries his tears by making his tears gets back to his eyes and as a result he becomes emotionless genius detective scene deserves 8 stars alone which explains why sherlock is so autistic robot in BBC remake lol. It also have a lot of unforgotable funny scenes like a retard girl yells \"what kind of dog it is\" at a turtle and yeets the turtle, watson draws pistol to sherlock just because watson couldn't realize it was sherlock when sherlock disgused himself only with fake mustache even though he just put on a fake mustache in front of watson, sherlock pees by calculating the angle, the force, gravity, et cetera just like robert downey jr's sherlock was epicI really want to see a sequel but unfortunately society doesn't like complex non-primitive modern pure comedy therefore it will never happen lol.

The core of the humor in the movie was making fun of idiosyncrasies of Brits and Yankees.The problem with the ratings for this movie lie in its inability to please either of its two principal demographics.\n(1) The smart audience will understand the pop-culture reference that is being parodied or mocked. However, once you realize the reference, the joke itself isn't particularly funny. The biggest component of a joke is the surprise. If the audience instantaneously knows where the joke is headed then it isn't really funny. For example, starting to compare unelected British Monarch and then mentioning American democratically elected president in the first sentence, already telegraphs the upcoming Trump joke.\n(2) The average audience will not understand any references and the movie doesn't really have any other types of jokes. So this type of audience is definitely going to dislike the movie.Watching the movie as like sitting at a standup comedy show that you have seen before, a few times. I can imagine there might be some who would be in hysterics watching this movie.

But reading a lot of the reviews on this site it just seems like people have misunderstood the comedy or gone into the film expecting something else.It pokes fun at both the Arthur Doyle books as well as very heavily the Sherlock movies with Robert Downey Jr.It does so in a very effortless manner and nothing feels forced, the comedy interactions all seem to come very natural and the jokes come and go very smoothly and nothing feels like it is shoved in your face.It is hard to say why so many people did not like the film but with comedy this is normal I guess as comedy is perhaps the one film genre that has no universal taste. When it comes to drama or action movies it is far easier to make a film that everyone will love.With comedy you will never find a movie that literally everyone loves, some people prefer old Pink Panther movies, some prefer new ones. Some people love the movie \"Airplane!\" others hate it.My style of comedy is Airplane as well as the new Pink Panther movies with Steve Martin. I also love Monty Python films.If you go into this film with an open mind you can come out enjoying it and will have probably had some good laughs. At least if the style of comedy is what you like.This is not the best comedy film I've seen either but that is why I have given it a 7 as it is worth watching once - having some good laughs and then probably never watching it again.",

They always compliment each other by bringing out their more childish and downright idiotic behavior! Not many actors can pull it off, and I believe they are the last remaining \"white males\" who have a free pass to act in such a way. Carefully trying to type the following sentence carefully on my cellphone when having a go on the potty; I in no means want to start a political debate. Keep in my mind this is my opinion and simply want to inform my fellow screen junkies why this movie is in fact good. Will Ferrale or \"Sherlock Holmes\" protrays this once known strong, handsome, smart character into a idiotic, feminine, and at times frail character. John C Reilley on the other hand stays a bit more true to the Character Watson, protraying the loyal, and slightly smarter doctor with the same hint of downright \"idiotic\" moments. So if you're hear to see another \"Step-bros\" or \"Talladega Nights\" movie well you're at the right place because that is exactly it... if you arn't such a fan, well my only opinion is try to watch it for what it is. A simple comedy of two guys acting like kids, kinda like the duo Jim Carrey and Jeff Daniels in \"Dumb and Dummer\". Yeah exactly like dumb and dumber! It's silly and has primitive humour. With that in mind I can guarantee you a good laugh or two in the movies. PS if you can't stand a harmless joke, such as a sexiest remark once or twice in this movies well stay away. I'm sure the directors and actors would appreciate not having to deal with your uptight comments or \"tweets\".

In a vomady movie if you start every thing then it should not be a comady any more. In the movie the real funny is how Farrel and Reily portray their characters.

I was grinning on the inside for most of the movie, which reminded me of how much I loved watching the Three Stooges--60 years ago! As for the Laurel and Hardy comparison--John C Reilly actually just got done playing Oliver Hardy in the wonderful biopic \"Stan And Ollie\"--yet another brilliant performance!",

I think this movie is simply over everyone's heads. The humor is quick sometimes and you might miss things easily.\nIt also mocks the whole \"sidekick\" concept. Why must so many superhero-type characters have a sidekick? It's so unfair to the sidekick. That always bugged me about Sherlock Holmes, too.\nI also love how the movie mocks the era...instead of all the glorification that period pieces usually do.\nI liked how it also mocks sexism, US-UK relations, British and American stereotypes, and US government/elections.\nI enjoyed the acting and the characters and the humor.

Secondly I enjoyed John C Reiley and probably made the film a little more watchable.\nThe small story it had seemed to be all over the place with no direction with some thrown in bad jokes about every two minutes and don't forget the pointless romance and love interest for sherlock to add a little spicy unfunniness.\nSome good British actors signed up for this film and I hope the making of this film won't keep them up at night.Overall its not the worst film I've seen but its probably down there, if you want to see how bad this film is I'd say go but if you're generally looking for a comedy twist about a famous detective I would stay away.",

            "content": "This movie is getting a lot of heat due to it being a very effective parody of the Sherlock Holmes franchise. If it had done a lesser job at mocking the franchise the reviews would've been far more favourable, but alas it was not. The portrayal of Dr. Watson and Sherlock Holmes in this movie is straight up character assasination - which I'd like to remind you is a great compliment for a parody as it is suppossed to 'take the piss' out of what it mimics.I'd compare this movie to 'Life of Brian' which heavily ridiculed the life of Jesus to great effect and at the time recieved a lot of flak for doing so. If you are a devout Christian you are to this day very unlikely to enjoy 'Life of Brian' as it is not kind to the topic it mocks, and the same goes for 'Holmes & Watson'. Many of those who are fans of the new movies made out of Doyle's most famous protagonist will likely be outraged at the sharp - and often both crude and cruel - criticisms of their portrayal of Holmes and Watson. They pull no punches and not only mock the characters but also the time period and the country and traditions of England as well.As someone who does not get offended by anything but poor writing, and who is a big fan of the Holmes character - but can't stand the movie versions of him, particularly the contemporary ones - I enjoyed every bit of this movie. It was made for me, and people like me, who understands and likes the source material but who can't stand how it's been portrayed by Hollywood.I would definitely recommend this movie to other people, even though they most likely won't enjoy it - maybe even because they won't enjoy it. Perhaps then they can share in some the pain I've had to endure as I've watched countless of poorly written movies that other people seem to like.This movie is the opposite of that, it's a well written movie that people hate. And they hate it simply because of what it is trying to do - which it does successfully. All the criticisms of this movie that I've heared - except for one concerning the lips of one of the acresses not matching her words in one scene, which is a valid point - have concerned itself with critiquing the fundamental aim of the parody, to ridicule Sherlock Holmes and Dr. Watson.It is as if they don't understand that a parody is not suppossed to play nice. This is not an homage, it's a takedown, and I loved every second of it.",

I'm not a film critic, I'm just a big fan of comedy.I waited a long time to watch Holmes and Watson because of how absolutely terrible the reviews here made it out to be, but I ended up enjoying it now that I've seen it. I won't say \"it's not as bad as people make it out to be\", because quite frankly I don't think it's bad at all. This is a decent comedy. The plot isn't Shutter Island but it kept me engrossed. It's more along the line of most Sandler films, the story is just a vehicle for the gags.A lot of the humor is subtle, in some cases referencing old stuff that a lot of young viewers just won't get. Have you seen Ghost, and do you know the song that plays during the clay molding scene? Well if not, an entire bit is going over your head. But if you do catch it you'll get a chuckle without any dialogue or physicality to provoke it. Likewise, some jokes require the viewer to pick up on facial or body reactions, sound, or even background material.There's a fair amount of politically incorrect and low brow humor which could put some people off. There are also a couple one liner modern day political digs that feel out of place and fall flat. Whoever made this film did not hire a what's cool in hollywood or at the BBC consultant. It's not a film for film critics either, that's for sure. It's also not as good as Step Brothers, which was a tough act to follow. I think these may be some reasons why it garnered so many one star reviews.I took the time to write this up so others who share my tastes might give this film a try for themselves rather than being put off by the scathing reviews. I gave it an 8. Not one of my all time favorites, but I'm glad I watched it. I'd say based on all the comedies I've seen, this would normally be sitting at a 5.5-5.9 rating  probably in the Joe Dirt sort of range, not the 3.8 it's got at the time I'm reviewing it.",

It's tragic that John C Reilly, whom has shown to be a genuinely funny and likeably quirky talent, is tied up in this, as it's well below him, even moreso than Step Brothers.  Supposedly, this movie was offered to Netflix for ultra-cheap when it was completed, and Netflix said No, knowing that it wasn't worth the money to turn into a Netflix exclusive, and I have NO doubt that this could be true - it really is that laborious and unfunny.

Reilly) are assigned to investigate the perpetrator of Queen Victoria's (Pam Ferris) future death on the Titanic. The murderer is their housekeeper Mrs. Hudson (Kelly Macdonald), who is a descendant of Dr. Moriarty (Ralph Fiennes), but don't expect me to analyze her plan because the movie doesn't care. Holmes & Watson is nothing but a barrage of predictable slapstick, insultingly deadly sexual jokes and painful meandering Victorian versions of modern-day references. Not to mention, there's an out-of-the-blue song sequence written by Alan Menken, who probably cashed his big paycheck for a pension fund and must have been ashamed penning such garbage. As for pop culture references, we get numerous allusions to Donald Trump's America, mentions of Fourth Wave feminism, and a cameo from Billy Zane at the end. Speaking of, the most insulting anachronism of all, aside from the drunken telegram sexting and the selfie from the Queen, the RMS Titanic was constructed in 1908 and launched in 1912, several years after Victoria's death. Not only that, the ship sailed not in London but in Southampton, tens of miles away. I know it's pointless to rag on a movie with nothing but comedic anachronism, but the Titanic ship is intentionally part of the storyline, one set in the nineteenth century where most Sherlock Holmes stories take place. Holmes & Watson is not only a downfall for Will Ferrell and John C. Reilly's careers, but also an insult to history, Arthur Conan Doyle's legacy and comedic intelligence.

I don't want to say that this movie was fantastic, but it wasn't bad, ya know? Sure there's some dumb pratfall and body fluids base humor that isn't my fav, but there is an actual plot of sorts, a twist, some funny moments, and some good one liners. The sets and costume are fantastic, a host of famous faces comprise the cast, and a modern spin on the very male-centric material of Artthur Conan Doyle give us several engaging female characters to enjoy. So. Why the hate? \n\nThere are plenty of stupid, slapstick movies made every year, and most people don't wipe the walls with them. Why so many rotten tomatoes for this one? All I can think is that while there have been a number of \"Bumbling Watsons\" portrayed in Sherlock adaptations over the years, but this may be the very first Bumbling Holmes.  \n\nSherlock Holmes is a beloved iconic archetype, the brilliant sleuth, the dashing superhero who saves the day not with his otherworldly powers or great brawn (though the Guy Ritchie movies DID get more into Holmes' prowess at boxing) but with his amazing intellect. It does my heart good to think that perhaps people are simply offended at such an unflattering version of the famous detective. If so, I feel ya, fam. I don't really revel in seeing Holmes turned into a buffoon, but the whole movie is silly, many things are lampooned and this Holmes fits into this crazy world of topsy turvy idiocy just fine. It isn't meant to be a literary classic, it's funny and goofy, and spoofing, and for a laugh or two, it isn't bad. I give this flick one out of two thumbs up.

Alas, it's just bad\u2026 BAD BAD BAD all the way down to its core. It's not silly or shocking or anything that might appeal to certain niche audiences, it's just dull and lifeless and staggeringly unfunny. I did not crack a smile even once, and it was everything I could do to make it all the way to the end. I even primed the pump with a few glasses of wine before viewing, thinking it would put me in a better frame of mind to enjoy it, but it was all for naught. I've had stomach flu that I've enjoyed more than this movie. The film was clearly trying to parody Guy Ritchie's Sherlock Holmes films, and it's failure is beyond epic. It does not even rise to the level of stupid\u2026 to call this movie stupid would be an insult to stupid movies. Oftentimes, I appreciate and enjoy stupid movies, but this\u2026 this is a void of nothingness, the black hole of fun, the complete absence of entertainment. How the once fabulously hilarious Ferrell/Reilly collaboration has come to this, I will never understand - even their considerable comedic talents cannot polish this turd.

Reilly is John Watson.  Moriarty wants to kill the queen, but that really doesn't come into play until about the halfway point.  I don't even really know where to begin with this mess.  I suppose that I knew something was rotten in Denmark when I learned that not even Netflix would buy the movie (seriously, look it up), and they pump out an Adam Sandler movie a year now.  I was groaning before the movie even started because I had a preconceived notion on what I was walking into.  I get no satisfaction in telling you that I was absolutely right.  I don't think anybody here can make excuses for being involved in this.  Every single person involved in this should know better, and they all deserve to get that talk from their parents: I'm not angry, I'm just very disappointed.  From talented actors like Ralph Finnes, Rebecca Hall and Kelly Macdonald, and even Ferrell and Reilly should be past roles like this at this point in their respective careers.  These aren't middle aged men anymore, they are both in their 50s, which is entirely too old to be playing these man-children.  Every joke gets stretched like chewing gum, and it is never enough to form any sort of story.  There are random anachronisms that never go anywhere that I guess are there to be funny, and they just keep hammering the same joke over and over... and over.  It's not on that same level as Disaster Movie or anything (because really, what is), but it's not all that far off.  I usually miss the end-of-the-year bad comedy that gets dumped in December as counter-programming to Oscar contenders.  This time around, my queue decided not to spare me.  They try to give a nod to Guy Ritchie's 2009 Sherlock with the slo-mo fighting, but they do it too often and incompetently for it to ever be funny.  There isn't even enough material here for a 6 minute SNL sketch, never mind a 90 minute feature.  It's not even a movie, it's just about 12 lame jokes that they keep punctuating until you're ready to throw something at the television.",

I have seen so many terrible B-movies and action flicks that amounted to fuck all, that this low-brow and forgettable piece of trash is quickly disqualified for that ignominious award. It's not even the worst thing Will Ferrell or John C. Reilly have put out. But it REALLY sticks in the craw for me in such a hateful manner. This movie fucked with the wrong loser.\n\nOh good God. There is no real plot here. Not that it mattered. No, this is a series of things that happen. Those things being two aging comedians screaming at each other like autistic children until someone yelled cut. The rough idea (I guess) was that someone REALLY wanted to satirize the Guy Ritchie directed Sherlock Holmes films with Robert Downey Jr. and Jude Law. Aside from the fact this movie is almost a decade too late on that front, it ignores the fact that those movies already WERE action comedies that had no problem making fun of their own premise and ridiculous steampunk tone. You were in on the joke AND you still had an interesting story and great chemistry between the main leads. And if you wanted a more serious and cerebral modern take on the classic character, you had the BBC series to fill your time. The other idea that led to this disaster was the history between Will Ferrell and John C. Reilly, which included cult favorites such as Talladega Nights and Step Brothers. And yeah that dynamic is there, buried beneath all the shit. There are a couple of jokes that work and Ferrell's English accent is not as terrible as one would assume.\n\nBut the rest is PAINFULLY unfunny. Aside from yelling all of their lines, overuse of the gag about Sherlock Holmes being able to calculate (or rather failing to calculate) the mathematics of a fight, jokes about how Watson REALLY wants to bang old Queen Victoria, there are numerous moments in which we are supposed to laugh at cocaine and heroin use. HEY GUYS! DID YOU KNOW THEY DID HARD DRUGS IN THE NINETEENTH CENTURY AND DIDN'T KNOW HOW DANGEROUS THEY WERE?! WIKIPEDIA SAID IT WAS IN THE BOOKS! PEOPLE IN OLDEN TIMES WERE SOOOOOO STUPID, UNLIKE NOW!!!\n\nI think there is one teachable moment in this dumpster fire. In one scene, Holmes and Watson visit the morgue. Watson asks the World's Greatest Detective if he will be queasy again at the sight of dead bodies. It was at this moment the horror of this joke dawned on me. They are going to make Sherlock Holmes into a stock Will Farrell character for the sake of an overlong vomit joke. Sure enough, he vomits uncontrollably for the next five minutes and can't even get past the lobby. He then flirts with a mute woman and Watson hits on a doctor while they perform an erotic autopsy. What I'm getting at here, is that good satire operates within the rules and world of the IP or topic they are deconstructing. Sherlock Holmes has pulled apart corpses and put them back together for fun. He has spent many a night in rooms FILLED WITH THEM. You are telling me that no comedic writer can get mileage out of THAT weird shit? By acknowledging the source material (and actually understanding it) you can properly take it apart for laughs. For good examples of this, see Mel Brooks' filmography, The LEGO Batman movie, and the first Austin Powers entry. Needless to say, this was where this movie pretty much died for me, long before we have Queen Victoria performing an opening ceremony on the Titanic so we can get a Billy Zane joke. (Yep. That happened.) Fuck this movie. And fuck the people that made it. Netflix didn't want this piece of shit. Think about that. They had no choice but to release it into theaters knowing it would bomb on all fronts. Perhaps the use of the Titanic was appropriate after all.",

So, we went, and we laughed, and we got the jokes, and we got the sarcasm, we even got the \"TRUMPed\" remark, and we laughed again. The easily offended may walk away with their noses in the air, but we got the humour, and we laughed again! Needless to say, we're still Ferrell, Reilly, Holmes and Watson fans! \n\nI must say, Ralph Fiennes plays his part so well! The accent he uses stunned me; I never expected that accent to come out of his mouth. I loved it! :D Well done, Mr Fiennes!\n\nAnd Kelly Macdonald!! Good call for Mrs Hudson. It was weird hearing her real accent, lol, but she was great, too!\n\nHugh Laurie, Pam Ferris, Rob Brydon, and Steve Coogan...

The theme music being vertually borrowed from the Robert Downey Jr. movies, and the excellent costuming helped. There were a few spots where the dubbing of Mrs. Hudson were quite noticible, but it being a comedy it didn't take me out of the story. There was a lot of laughing during the watching, but I feel few people were in the audience as the press got out ahead of the general audiences with negative spin.

Still, even if Holmes & Watson were to come out some eleven years ago it wouldn't have been directed by Adam McKay (the director of those aforementioned Ferrell and Reilly collaborations) and that is the chief issue with this rushed, lifeless,  excursion into a premise that never takes off; a skit that should have been cut not because of a lack of time, but because the premise wasn't near substantial enough to support the time it's given. \n\nAs someone who turned 16 in 2003 and already adored Ferrell due to his SNL performances it was like seeing the rest of the world discover what I already knew that year when he delivered the one-two punch of Old School and Elf (I realize the former wasn't immediately seen as a success, but it's long since become a cult favorite). In the years that followed, Ferrell would go on to become a comedy titan thanks in large part to his collaborations with McKay-each of which are exceptional in their own right-but if Holmes & Watson signifies anything it is the end of an era; the final nail in the coffin that began being built a few years back with the likes of Get Hard and Daddy's Home, and continued through to last year with The House and a Daddy's Home sequel. In 2009, something like Land of the Lost was the exception, not the rule, but Ferrell has turned such expectations on their head and now we expect nothing less than cheap comedy from a guy who was once the king of being smart and cutting by being dumb and funny. Ferrell isn't the only one who has fallen prey to this plague of unfunny-friends in his \"Frat Pack\" have also had an equally tough time adapting their comedy and careers to their age as Stiller made Zoolander 2, Vaughn and Owen Wilson re-teamed for The Internship, and who knows where Luke Wilson has been for the last decade, but Ferrell's fall-for one reason or another-hurts a little more. \n\nHolmes & Watson is not a good movie and considering how good we know Ferrell and John C. Reilly can be together Holmes & Watson is even more disappointing, but it's not the out and out atrocity that's causing hoardes of walk-outs either. It has less than a handful of inspired comedic moments in a script where the same joke is repeated scene after scene to the same degree of effectiveness: little to none. A musical number that should have gone bigger and a zinger of a cameo, both near the end of the film, are easily the best things writer/director Etan Cohen's film has to offer. So, is Holmes & Watson a good movie? No. Was I ever bored to the point I didn't continue to hold out hope things might get better? No, not until the end came and I realized hope for Ferrell might forever be lost. At least until he gets a little older and redeems himself critically with more serious-minded work only to then make a glorious return to comedy and is subsequently discovered by a new generation of fans where the likes of Holmes & Watson will have long been forgotten and is never brought up again.",

It's okay, doesn't mean that just because it doesn't suit your sense of humour, it cannot suit anyone else's. \n\nTheir comedies are usually stupid humour, have you seen Step brothers, Talladega Nights etc? \n\nIf it helps, I'm a 26 yr old woman who enjoys a wide range of movies & TV Shows from the 60s-2000s, has read 1000s of books loses interest in terribly written stories/scripts.\n\nThis is easily one of my top 3 favourite movies, considering it to be number 1. My other favourites include Marvel movies, but even they aren't that good in comparison of pure enjoyment & unpredictability.\n\nAnyone who expected high class humour out of these guys had their expectations too high in my humble opinion. I recommend for people to watch it & make up their own minds.",

Some were even so bad it was good and that is the charm of loving bad movies. I am the man who has No Holds Barred in every format it was released in(including betamax). I go to horror movie screenings all the time. I go to Rocky Horror every year for Halloween as well as the showings of The Room when it plays in my area. I saw BOTH parts of Best F(r)iends on the day they were in theaters and loved them(Tommy Wiseau IS GOD!). Some of my favorite movies are ones that people consider \u00ef\u00bf 1/2 1/2bad\u00ef\u00bf 1/2 1/2\u00ef\u00bf 1/2\u00c2?.\n\nWhy am I mentioning all of this? \n\nBecause as an expert on bad movies, I\u00ef\u00bf 1/2 1/2(TM)m here to tell you that Holmes and Watson is by far, the WORST MOVIE I HAVE EVER SEEN! I\u00ef\u00bf 1/2 1/2(TM)ve seen thousands of movies in my 32 years, none have been as bad as this. There are no redeeming qualities at all. \n\nI was excited for this movie as I loved Step Brothers as well as both Anchorman movies and Elf. Will Ferrell movies are usually funny. This one was not. It\u00ef\u00bf 1/2 1/2(TM)s like they got high one day and thought it would be funny to take a \u00ef\u00bf 1/2 1/2Flintstones\u00ef\u00bf 1/2 1/2\u00ef\u00bf 1/2\u00c2? approach to Sherlock Holmes and mix it with the crudest jokes they can imagine. \n\nThe jokes fall flat, the execution is all wrong, the script writing is terrible, and the actors give no meaning behind their performances. It\u00ef\u00bf 1/2 1/2(TM)s like from scene to scene, they don\u00ef\u00bf 1/2 1/2(TM)t know who they are supposed to be. Almost like they are making it up as they go along. It worked for Soap because Soap was actually funny and you had great improv comedy actors. This movie had none of that.\n\nI do have one badge of honor. It is my predilection for bad movies that allowed me to watch it the entire way through and not walk out like most who watched this movie. Yes, I did see people walking out when I watched it. But I never walked out of a movie all my life and this movie wasn\u00ef\u00bf 1/2 1/2(TM)t going to break that cycle. I suffered all throughout but I didn\u00ef\u00bf 1/2 1/2(TM)t quit. Because quitting is for losers and winners never quit. \n\nThank GOD I used this as one of my A-List selections so I didn\u00ef\u00bf 1/2 1/2(TM)t really pay for it. If I did, you better believe I would have demanded a refund and sued the theater, Columbia Pictures, and everyone involved with making this atrocity for emotional distress. In fact, I might even just do that.....hold on a minute.....I have to call my lawyer......",

            "content": "Firstly I\u00ef\u00bf 1/2(TM)d like to say that 21st century, stuck up dbags need to learn what a JOKE is. This film was packed full of really silly, fun jokes. Some were a bit obvious but none the less they were all funny. \n\nWhat happened to an easy sense of humour?\nWhat happened to puns and references to relevant media that we all chuckled at?\n\nWill Ferrel and John C Reilly(aka Dr.Brule) were brilliant in this rendition of Sherlock Holmes. As a British person I especially enjoyed their over accented fake accents and the play on old Victorian language they used. It was funny. It created comedy in itself. \nThe plot was simple and moved quickly, allowing for the pair to go about their adventure in a whimsical manner without too much focus on problem solving or anything too complicated. It was a plot made for old fashioned jokes. In their typical style, there was lots of shouting of humorous lines and strange facial expressions that could not fail but to make you giggle. The very well established role of will ferrel as an egotistical protagonist was not only maintained in the character of Sherlock but brilliantly juxtaposed by his faithful  friend Watson, who desperately sought Sherlock\u00ef\u00bf 1/2(TM)s approval.\n\nThe cameos in the film were a fun added extra for anyone who is a fan of such a thing, although I didn\u00ef\u00bf 1/2(TM)t find them particularly funny. They envoked a pleasant sense of familiarity and most definitely aided to the comedy, however  the duo led the way through the majority of the jokes.\n\nThe film was not perfect and it wasn\u00ef\u00bf 1/2(TM)t as belly achingly funny as step brothers, but MY GOD PEOPLE, chill out, be happy and open your mind to the film as being a couple of dudes doing some pretty silly jokes making for a hilarious hour and a half. Don\u00ef\u00bf 1/2(TM)t go in with expectations of a grandly comedic adaptation of the great Sherlock Holmes. No. It was definitely a mystery who the killer was, which is an important anecdote to make, but it\u00ef\u00bf 1/2(TM)s not meant to simulate Sherlock Holmes or your regular spoof. It\u00ef\u00bf 1/2(TM)s a film and story all of its own, using the characters as a vehicle to create their own familiar spin comedy.\n\nGo to the cinema, download it, wait for it to come on Netflix or whatever you like, but give it a chance. \n\nRemember, it\u00ef\u00bf 1/2(TM)s a film full of jokes so sit back and try and have a laugh!",

            "content": "Holmes and Watson does not offer high hopes going into it. The film currently sits at 6% on Rotten Tomatoes and at one point had the dreadful honour of being completely at 0%.\n\nWatching it confirms the fact that it is entirely rotten. Which is an absolute shame. Will Ferrell and John C. Reilly are comedy greats and usually together their humour is multiplied...but clearly the problem lies in the script and direction.\n\nBoth duties fall under Etan Cohen, not to be confused with Joel and Ethan Coen and definitely not to be confused with Joel Cohen, writer of Garfield. Of all the Coen/Cohen's in Hollywood, we've found our Paul W.S. Anderson equivalent.\u00c2\u00a0\n\nPreviously the filmmaker behind Ferrell vehicle Get Hard, it's amazing to see someone get worse, particularly this worse.\u00c2\u00a0\n\nHolmes and Watson has all the trappings of a Sherlock Holmes story and all the trappings of a potentially great comedy handled with the grace of the Running of the Bulls through the World's Largest China Shop. So inefficient and unfunny, it's definitely not great when you look around at the silence caused by the severe lack of jokes in the minutes before the opening credits (except one person in my screening, but there's always gonna be one intergalactic alien trying to fit in as a secret human).\n\nThe film is severely bland and lacking, full of choices that seem completely misguided. Ferrell decides to put on a strange accent for Holmes that doesn't work at all, and Reilly's Watson is overly and unfunnily violent, yet these are choices never dissuaded by the director, which is concerning.\n\nHolmes and Watson has a story, if you can believe that, one where Moriarty (played by the criminally underused and probably overpaid Ralph Fiennes) has a presence, but is harshly pushed to the side in favour of an invisible antagonist you can figure out by spoilers by billing.\u00c2\u00a0\n\nOn a completely unrelated note, Kelly MacDonald is in this movie and she continues to be brilliant and brilliantly Scottish in the things that she makes, and while her character is there for a bunch of anachronistic jokes and pushed to the side too, when her arc thins out it feels like it was a good idea made sour at the drop of a hat.\n\nSomewhere, in this movie, there is a joke. I guess. I hope. Much like A Million Ways to Die in the West and other films of that ilk, the only thing that made me laugh was a heavy reference to a much better film that had humour in the fact it took you completely out of the movie you were watching, because it's safer.\n\nHolmes and Watson is a hollow entry to round out the year of comedy movies. Alan Menken and Glenn Slater offer the second closest thing to a joke with an original song that's a parody of their work that's nothing compared to Vanelope's \"I want\" song parody in Ralph Breaks the Internet.\u00c2\u00a0\n\nEverything in this movie has been done better and bigger and funnier and smarter. Hell, even the overrated later episodes of BBC's Sherlock itself parodies itself better, even down to a drunk Sherlock scene that doesn't have to stoop so low as this movie does for an attempt of a laugh.\n\nIt joins a bunch of movies I would give no stars to if I could, but the sheer fact that somehow this movie made it from conception to the silver screen is some sort of commendation. Plus it has a Titanic joke that makes no sense, but it makes more sense than the entirety of the film.\u00c2\u00a0\n\nAnd before you say something, yes, the majority of jokes in this film are indeed out of time. And out of this world.\n\nWhich is not a good thing.\u00c2\u00a0\n\n1/5 Stars.\n\n- CJ",

I believe I am slightly bias because I admire their previous film Step Brothers (2008), which has a constant tendency of raunchy hilarity, so my expectations were at par with that movie. If you're expecting elements from Step Brothers, I highly recommend waiting to rent this on Amazon or avoid its entirety. ",

They break all the rules on how white male landowners should conduct themselves by screaming at the top of their lungs for their female servant girl. The actress who plays the servant girl does a good job falling into the scene as she buttons up her gown and is followed around by whichever gent she was with when she was summoned by the unabashed crimes solvers. Then there is a American female doctor who has to prove herself to Holmes and Watson to be a doctor because there are no female Doctors in Victorian England. \n\nThere are plenty of drug references to make fun of Sherlock Holmes  penchant for chasing the dragon. There are plenty of phallic jokes and opportunities for the characters to call each other wankers.  a wanker. Dr. House makes a special appearance as Holmes telepathic brother. How could they put Dr. Watson in the back with the elephant man? Billy Zane makes a surprise appearance as himself and he impresses on other ship boarders the size of his canoe. Holmes and Watson save the Titanic from sinking before it left England's shores to, well... sink. Ralph Fiennes plays the imposter and the real Dr. Moriarty. At the end, Dr. Moriarty is hiding out in Wyoming, leaving room for a sequel of Holmes and Watson hunting Dr. Moriarty in the Wild West. They have to wear a good disguise. Handle bar mustache will suffice\n\nThere are enough light hearted quips about Trump and American politics to have a sequel set in the West. England gave us our freedom, we should at least have a good USA sequel. If Holmes and his wrongly convicted counterpart (Holmes almost sends Dr. Watson to the gallows) can't save the Queen's life (despite killing her, they do save her in the end) at least they have a chance to make England great!",

Worse than little Brittan, where one of the main leads labeled it comedian's comedy, but what about everybody else?  It's this which stops Will from being a truly great actor like the off beat comedian of old Tom Hanks (believe it or not, see his early 80's work).\n\nSo, what is it, off beat american comedy applied over British comedy going too far.  British comedy works because they withstrain themselves, use tension on the joke, channel and direct themselves.  I was looking at a bit of the American comedy overlay in this, but Will trying to polish his succulent bitch vegetable, encouraging Watson to kill himself off handedly repeatedly and trying to pump the queen, are all classic examples of over reach, even Watson trying to hold the Queens hand, needy.  Take them away, and other parts of the dead Queen V incident, and yeah, it's better.  Put it this way, without those I could give it an extra star, or two.  I wouldn't mind seeing a second film a little toned down in more British style (British Comedy School, and then learn to play with that).  A new Cool Will 2.\n\nThe rest of the film, OK, a bit muddling in parts, three stars.  Appeals to certain people, and not to others (like reviews in here).  So, don't mistake it for a terrible movie, unless its not your cup of tea.",

As someone who loved Anchorman, Step Brothers, and Talladega Nights, I was severely let down by this turd. The more I think about why this movie sucks, the more I realize the key to a good Will Ferrell / John C Reilly movie is editing. Let the guys do their ad libs. Shoot hours and hours of footage. And then get a good editor to weave everything together into a 90 minute comedy. It was obvious that the editing sucked in this flick. The timing and pacing was off. The humor always seemed a beat behind. Hell...they should have edited the movie like they did the trailer. It was actually funnier than the film. If you're a huge, diehard fan of either Ferrell or Reilly and insist on seeing it, wait until the movie shows up on Netflix. For everyone else--just stay away.",

The trailers presented it as a fun, comedic take on a Sherlock Holmes story; that couldn\u00ef\u00bf 1/2 1/2(TM)t have been further from the truth. Instead, the \u00ef\u00bf 1/2 1/2comedy\u00ef\u00bf 1/2 1/2\u00ef\u00bf 1/2\u00c2? relied mostly on profanity and strayed so far from the realm of Sherlock Holmes that it was almost unrecognizable. Holmes and Watson also threw in some political jokes which could have been funny if not for the horribly akward timing and anachronistic basis. (Minor Spoiler) While on the subject of horribly awkward timing, the uncomfortable musical number made little sense and, therefore, got little laughs.\n\nThat being said, there were a few funny moments in this monstrosity of a movie. (Minor Spoiler) In a scene where the Queen of England supposedly dies while taking a self photograph (selfie), Holmes and Watson struggle to hide her body, gaining genuine laughs through the use of slapstick. In addition to this moment, there are a few other good laughs in there albeit, not many.\n\nOverall, Holmes and Watson presents hackneyed humor and downright odd portrayals of the famous Sherlock Holmes and Dr. John Watson. By missing this movie, one misses absolutely nothing of importance, except for the bragging rights of saying one has made it through this thoroughly awful movie.",

This movie had a few jokes that didn't land that you probably saw 100 times in the trailers, the selfie in particular, but it had so many hilarious moments that would make anyone laugh. And hey if you we're so offended by the one joke about Trump that you didn't laugh the rest of the movie or you left and demanded a refund I would bet that the people that made this movie didn't want your money or review anyways.",

There's some bawdy adolescent shtick but - I mean what do these \"critics\" expect?\n\n\nI went to see the movie with my brother-in-law and even though other movies opening the same weekend may have drawn more people, everyone laughed out loud at the movie.  There are some political jokes, which I found extremely humorous but, to each his own...

This film is not up there with elf or anchor man but sits somewhere behind them, certainly not as bad as some of the recent offerings \u00ef\u00bf 1/2get hard\u00ef\u00bf 1/2\u00c2? etc   I chuckled most of the way through with the Holmes nearly spaced, leaving the cinema entertained.

It's not good, but I didn't think this was absolutely the worst movie of 2018. From Director Etan Cohen who last brought us Get Hard (2015) Holmes and Watson is a comedic take on Sherlock Holmes and his partner Watson. Sherlock Holmes (Will Ferrell) and John Watson (John C Reilly) have just solved their most recent case revolving around the evil Dr. Moriarty (Ralph Fiennes) when the Queen (Pam Ferris) hires the duo to figure out a mystery surrounding a note saying the Queen will die within the week. Holmes and Watson are on the case and along with an American doctor named Grace Hart (Rebecca Hall) and her bumbling assistant Millie (Lauren Lapkus) they work to solve the case. This is literally the nicest I could have been here about the plot. It's incredibly simply, silly and predictable. Ferrell and Reilly have the same great chemistry they usually have, but its hindered with the whole Holmes and Watson personas. I almost feel like this would have worked better as an original tale and not as it was based on previous material. The movie is actually funny at times. It's incredibly dumb and maybe coming in with no expectations helped. I laughed a bit and enjoyed it overall. It's not perfect, or even particularly good. It has some moments that are funny, but this is definitely just a rental at best don't waste your time on this one in the theaters.",

Reilly have excellent timing and really held the film together. Other reviewers on here have complained that the jokes were telegraphed as if that was a negative; I felt the fact that they were telegraphed made them all the funnier because we were in on the joke that these two were so clueless as to not realize what was going on. For example, when Holmes and Watson take turns slapping each other in the face to try to kill a mosquito. The timing is superb! With straight faces these guys slap away obvilious to the fact that they are becoming Moe and Larry Howard from the three stooges.\n\nOReilly's reaction to Holmes' \"disguise\" is uncommon in its sincerity. Watching Holmes create Watson's disguise is a hoot if you are not a stuffed shirt.\n\nSome of you maybe needed a cocktail to let down your walls. I predict this film will become a cult classic one day.\n\nIt's definitely closer to a 10. than a 1. A 1? Nuts! Sad 1 Star reviewers missed out on the fun.",

I went hoping to laugh at anything but this was total garbage.  The only semblance of humor to be had didn't even come from the leads in the movie but were often the product of sight gags.  The jokes were stale, mistimed, and weak.  There were jokes from items that had not be a pop-culture reference for nearly a decade.  In the middle of an already meaningless jumble of story, the movie even attempts to hop on a soapbox and claim some sort of political relevancy which can be humorous if done with a deft hand but this just came across as misplaced and pointless.  I believe the last straw for me was watching someone who has been in some of the funniest movies I have ever seen stalling out through an hour and fifteen minutes of runtime only to say, \"I swear that if he breaks out into song, I am out of here.\"  ...then he did.

I knew I was going to love this movie the second the little girl grabbed (young) Sherlock's turtle and threw it shouting (I paraphrase), \"What kind of stupid dog is this!?\" This is not a satire - it's a total send up, and if you love Sherlock Holmes but realize how freaking inherently goofy the famous detective is, and how the Holmes/Watson relationship is so similar to the hilarious dynamic between Ricky Bobby and Cal Naughton, Jr. - you must appreciate this. There is a plot for anyone paying attention. Sherlock refuses to feel anything (he uncries!), and learns that he needs to understand love in order to solve crimes. They have a fricking full out Hollywood musical number at the end which alone makes the film as brilliant as any Will Ferrell/John C. Reilly film you've ever seen. Honestly, were all these negative reviews written by people who hate comedy?  Also - the not-so-subtle digs at American culture are spot on and hilarious. Pay attention. Slapstick humor, gross-out humor, plus witty dialogue (\"A lady doctor!\" \"How do you spell doctor?\" \"Does doctor mean something different in America?\") equals another Will Ferrell/John C. Reilly triumph. New favorite movie.",

I wanted to see why the critics gave it such a low score and I think I understand...they think the absolute stupidity of it is somehow accidental. If you go into a film starring these two guys expecting some kind of thrilling plot and something at all serious then you're missing the point, this is just pure, farcical lunacy which for me works on every level. The characters of Holmes and Watson are parodied so effectively, it's obvious the writers know them well and are fans of Holmes. This film is as quotable as Anchorman and I think that over time it will also achieve cult status. Any film that Rotten tomatoes gives 3% should spike your interest. I read people were walking out of cinemas but the one I was in was full of people roaring with laughter and the film even got an applause at the end, which I've never seen before. I recommend you make your own mind up about this film and don't listen to people who don't appreciate this kind of bizarre and daft comedy.

Reilly. The film focuses on how Dr. John Watson (Reilly) was once contemplating suicide, but stumbles across a clever and mysterious man named Sherlock Holmes (Ferrell), and the two guys seem to get along and hit it off and become a duo. We see that Holmes and Watson crack many cases and solve many crimes, until they one day let the evil Moriarty (Ralph Fiennes) escape making everyone believe that he is innocent. The film then ponders along with unfunny scenes followed by even more unfunny scenes, we see that the duo are invited to meet the Queen, and discover that there was a murder and that the Queen's life is in potential danger, so the duo get on the case to find out who the culprit could be. There is no clever moments in this film, I usually admire the sharply funny Will Ferrell and John C. Reilly, whether they are together ('Step Brothers'), or when they're apart. The film, written and directed by Etan Cohen seems to restrain them from doing anything genuinely funny, and instead they are resorted to just screaming to the top of their lungs, talking and talking about unfunny things, or just making faces at each other without any worthy punchline. It's a largely misconceived comedy that badly tries to squeeze a laugh out of the audience without any use of subtlety and uses an Adam Sandler type approach. Sometimes less is more.",

Written and directed by Etan Cohen, the film is widely considered one of the biggest flops of 2018. The movie hasHolmes & Watson is a comedic take on Arthur Conan Doyle's classic detective stories, featuring Sherlock Holmes and John Watson. Written and directed by Etan Cohen, the film is widely considered one of the biggest flops of 2018. The movie has been criticized for its poor slapstick humor, sexual innuendo and a lack of chemistry between the lead actors Will Ferrell and John C. Reilly. The cast, which includes Kelly Macdonald, Rebecca Hall, Ralph Fiennes, Steve Coogan, Hugh Laurie, Pam Ferris and Rob Brydon, are also said to be wasted in this poorly written script. The story takes place in 1881 London and follows Watson as he meets and befriends Holmes, becoming his assistant and later moving in together to become the ultimate crime-solving duo. However, the film fails to live up to the humor and storytelling of previous adaptations and is criticized for its inconsistent and anachronistic portrayal of Victorian London. Overall, it's a movie best avoided by both fans of the original stories and comedy lovers.________________________Holmes & Watson es una versi\u00f3n c\u00f3mica de las cl\u00e1sicas historias de detectives de Arthur Conan Doyle, con Sherlock Holmes y John Watson. Escrita y dirigida por Etan Cohen, la pel\u00edcula es ampliamente considerada como uno de los mayores fracasos de 2018. La pel\u00edcula ha sido criticada por su pobre humor, sus insinuaciones sexuales y la falta de qu\u00edmica entre los actores principales Will Ferrell y John C. Reilly. Tambi\u00e9n se dice que el elenco, que incluye a Kelly Macdonald, Rebecca Hall, Ralph Fiennes, Steve Coogan, Hugh Laurie, Pam Ferris y Rob Brydon, est\u00e1 desperdiciado en este gui\u00f3n mal escrito. La historia tiene lugar en Londres en 1881 y sigue a Watson cuando conoce y se hace amigo de Holmes, se convierte en su asistente y luego se mudan juntos para convertirse en el d\u00fao definitivo para resolver cr\u00edmenes. Sin embargo, la pel\u00edcula no est\u00e1 a la altura del humor y la narraci\u00f3n de adaptaciones anteriores y es criticada por su interpretaci\u00f3n inconsistente y anacr\u00f3nica del Londres victoriano. En general, es una pel\u00edcula que es mejor evitar tanto para los fan\u00e1ticos de las historias originales como para los amantes de la comedia.",
