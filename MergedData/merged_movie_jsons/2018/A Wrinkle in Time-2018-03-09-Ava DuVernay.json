I haven't read the books, I have no idea what the story was supposed to be, but even so I knew there was something deeply utterly wrong with it. It really felt like the hallucinations of a drugged person trying to make sense of the story behind and failing miserably. It was so bad that I suspected sabotage. Is it that someone intentionally didn't want it to be any good? I know I should attribute to malice what can easily be explained by stupidity, but in this case, it is far from easy.The only reason I rated it three stars (towards the funny end of the spectrum) is because of its inadvertent humor, best appreciated while drunk or stoned or part of Myst3k. So many scenes seem to hint to other materials: Star Trek, Dr. Who, Neverending Story. Or maybe it was just me trying to make sense of something completely random. A good description for this movie: white noise. A better one: pretty colored noise.",

            "content": "By the time \"Wrinkle\" reached its climactic scenes, where the stakes are highest and the resolution hangs in the balance, it carried so much forward momentum that I had to keep waking myself up so I wouldn't snore and bother the other theater patrons. Yeah...it was like that. Look, I'll admit: I've never read the book (shame on me, I guess, as a lifelong lover of SF and general metaphysical weirdness), so I can't judge \nDuVernay's \"A Wrinkle In Time\" as an adaptation of L'Engle's literary favorite. But I CAN measure it as a film that wants to tell a story, and on that scale...um......Uy. Never is there a real sense of conflict with which to engage: the tone and mood are so lovey-dovey, from stem to stern, that the film never feels like it's progressing in any meaningful way. The galaxy-gobbling threat doesn't, and isn't. Good performers are wasted on one-note characters (be they whimsical space-nymphs or oh-so-precious baby geniuses) in puzzling costumes and -- were those hairdos? I think they were hairdos. I mean, they were where hair is supposed to be. Expensive FX fill the screen in service to a plot that *drifts* through its paces instead of *advancing*. If there was variance in the musical score, I missed it (but I think I didn't, because I think there wasn't). Michael Pe\u00f1a is asked to leave his \"Ant-Man\" charm at home and put on a goofy mustache and some red contacts for like a few minutes, and Captain Kirk (the new one, anyway) has a beard and is interesting, but doesn't really do anything and OPE what nope I'm awake not snoring sorry no.This is going to be someone's favorite movie, and that's a beautiful thing; art needn't be categorically *good* to be *effective*, after all, and I love the hell out of \"Xanadu\", so I should know. But a film that wants to tell a story should be equipped to tell a story, and if it can't do that, then...it's doing something else, I dunno, I'm.........huh? No, no, I was just...just resting my eyes. It's nice, maybe you should do the same.",

            "content": "Wow. Something went wrong here. For a movie with the backing of Disney and all the resources that they poses, they must have turned a blind eye to this film, or they must have tried to manipulate and control it super tightly. This movie shocked me with how bad it was, and how Disney would release a movie this bad. They don't do it often.\n From start to finish, this movie is disorderly, and confusing. Maybe because I didn't read the book, but I shouldn't have to read the book in order to enjoy the movie. The actors all seemed to lack chemistry and understanding of the role. The three children just couldn't carry the plot along. It was a disaster around every corner.\n A Wrinkle in Time could easily be turned into a rated R film in my opinion, the one thing holding it back was the fact that it was kids and Disney. But had this been Tim Burton like Alice in Wonderland, well it would have been better directed, but it would have set in on a specific style and flow. A Wrinkle in Time never really planted its feet into a specific feel. It seemed to take itself super seriously, but what was happening on screen didn't match up. The score really didn't help. The movie was scored as a dramatic, serious, epic, however, on screen it was kids running around to \"save the world\".\nThe effects were beyond cheesy. I countlessly had flashbacks to the fantastic hit \"Spy Kids 3: Game Over\" and its partner \"Shark Boy and Lava Girl\". In all regards, this movie could rival those movies on the Disney Channel, but this one is too messed up and twisted for kids to even enjoy it. They managed to make a movie that both adults and children could dislike. Disney seems to achieve first still today.",

There's some beautiful imagery here, but then there's also too much green screen and CGI going on that it just loses it's luster. What is the deal with this director also? There were probably 70+ shots inches away from each actors face. It didn't look pretty and was extremely distracting to me. Somehow this director had all of these great actors and couldn't even get anything out of the majority of them. Chris Pine was about the only person that did a good job here.

Worse is that the dialogue, character development, the overuse of CGI and the convoluted plot is making it a major disappointment of 2018. Even the acting is not good with one that goes unnatural like Mindy Kaling and Zach Galifianakis while Reese Witherspoon's and Deric McCabe's acting goes over the top and very annoying and even Oprah Winfrey comes as total bland and boring.The only redeeming qualities is that film contains empowering messages as well a great statement to diversity and feminism as well the performances of Storm Reid, Gugu Mbatha-Raw and Chris Pine which are the only saving graces. A Wrinkle in Time should have been the next Wonder Woman. It's a big shame that all of the great intentions were given a waste of time, effort and talent.Lastly, it is clear that the adaptations of sci-fi genre cannot work for Disney as demonstrated in the previous sci-fi adaptations that failed before such as Tomorrowland, Tron: Legacy, and John Carter.",

The astral travel in A Wrinkle in Time is where teen Meg (Storm Reid) must go through a portal to find her scientist father. He's been gone for 4 years, having discovered that portal as physicist and entered it, foolish dad to abandon family just to go where no man has ever gone before.Unfortunately, Meg's coming of age as she travels with wunderkind little brother, Charles Wallace (Deric McCabe), and high school chum Calvin (Leo lookalike Levi Miller), never involves defining challenges but rather just murky CGI and an evil force straight out of Arrival's Rorschach alien. While we hear about her need to have more confidence and be more aggressive, when she finally achieves those, the film is almost over, and the transforming beats are not obvious anyway.\nEven the \"Which's\" interstellar guides, play by Oprah Winfrey, Reese Witherspoon, and Mindy Kaling, are unimpressive personalities with equally unimpressive costumes. While they might be a cross between the benign Glinda of Oz and the three witches of Shakespeare on Prozac, they are not seminal to Meg's development or the plot's.I can advise Oprah to slink back to her kingdom and Pine to go back to his starship. As for you, audience, I advise you to avoid this clunker and see The Shape of Water. No, that's not kids' stuff, but maybe that's all for the good.

However, I also kept saying \"I hope Disney doesn't screw this up again,\" after the travesty TV version they made in the early 2000s.Lo and behold, they managed to screw it up again.Let's start with the few bright spots (and calling them bright spots is even generous). First, I did enjoy the visual depiction of the tesseract. Also, the casting was pretty good. Storm Reid was well cast as Meg, and Mrs. Who and Mrs. Which were also portrayed well, despite that they drastically downplayed Mrs. Which's character.Now, the bad (and there is a lot of bad). Mrs. Whatsit was changed into a completely negative character who seemed completely inept and pessimistic. Important points in the book (Ixiel and Aunt Beast, for example) were completely ignored and given only cursory mentions so fleeting that you barely even notice it.\nThe Man with Red Eyes is turned into marionette who literally collapses on screen. I get that in the novel he was a \"puppet\" of IT, but the depiction in the movie was laughable.\nThe ridiculous storm scene when they first arrive on Camazotz came out of nowhere and was so ridiculously portrayed. First, they're struggling to find Charles Wallace, then they go through this ridiculous storm sequence, and when they make it over this wall (which again, was nowhere in the source material), that concern for Charles Wallace is completely gone until he pops out of nowhere saying \"here I am.\" And are Meg and Calvin relieved to see him? Nope. It's more like \"meh, okay.\"\nThe movie completely left out how Calvin and Dr. Murray got back from Camazotz. All of a sudden, they're just back. Poof, no explanation.I get that certain stories require work to adapt: I didn't get particularly outraged with some of the changes \"Prince Caspian\" and \"Voyage of the Dawn Treader\" made in the Narnia series because those were short novels whose structure required adaption to make them cinematic. I wasn't necessarily pleased with all of them, but given the structure of the books, it was understandable that some work had to be done.\n\"A Wrinkle in Time\" was different. It's a very linear story which already was very cinematic and could easily translate itself from page to screen. But instead of a faithful adaption, the filmmakers decided to ignore 90% of the source material.Strike 2, Disney. You've now screwed this same story up twice.",

But actually it's pretty good, at least according to my girlfriend and myself.Based on the classic kid's book, this tells the story of two children who go on a crazy, mysterical adventure in search of their father, a physicist who somehow made it into space with nothing more, it seems, than a wish and a prayer.I've read the book a couple of times, once as a kid and once as an adult surprised because he didn't remember how Jesus-y the book was.I like the character of Meg, who is smart and determined and afraid and in desperate need of self esteem. One of the major themes was, love yourself, and I found Meg's growing confidence touching.I was a bit disappointed by Charles Wallace. I recall the character being odd and brilliant, but in the movie he really seems like a pretty ordinary kid. I had an affinity to the book Charles Wallace because I saw myself as odd and intellectual gifted (in retrospect I was more the former than the latter), but I didn't see myself at all in this movie version.The three wise ladies are fun, particularly a funny Reese Witherspoon as the most prickly of the bunch. The special effects looked good (caveat, I saw this on TV) and the story is well paced. Like any good kid's movie there's a nice mix of humor and pathos.The religious aspects of the book have been stripped out, which I consider generally positive, although it does make the whole good/evil thing feel a little amorphous. I also felt the book was more interested in scientific thought than the movie, which leaves out things I loved as a kid like visiting a two-dimensional world.So why don't people like this? It could in part be the disappointment of the movie related to the trailer. The trailer made it look like the whole movie was this stunningly gorgeous bit of magic and female empowerment, but the scenes that made up the trailer are more the exception than the rule. Even though I enjoyed the movie, I think I would have enjoyed the movie promised by the trailer more.There are also super-fans of the book who are going to object to any changes, including the lack of religiousity. There are also, unfortunately, people who object to the children being biracial, wanting them to be the white children they pictured when they read the book. In fact, as I write this, the most-liked review on IMDB specifically complains about that. (The second most-liked review takes pains to say that's not the problem, though, so I don't think this is a simple case of crackers pushing the rankings down).Look, it's not a perfect movie. It's conceptually silly, and it's not one of these kid's films like A Little Princess that transcends kids movies, but it's lots of fun. My guess is it will be one of these movies that becomes more popular in 15 years as a generation of kids who liked it become adults who can offer opinions.

Even though he had a small role, he fit the role perfectly and was not so excessive. The color scheme is very bright and colorful, which makes the movie somewhat interesting, even with the subpar acting and plot.....Bad: The acting all around is either subar from the cast or over the top from Mindy Kaling and Zach Galifianakis that it comes out unnatural. Even with a good cast consisting of Oprah Winfrey and Reese Witherspoon, they did not add much to the movie's benefit. Disney spent so much money on its adult characters that they forgot to hire good child actors/actresses for the child cast members are not even on par with some of the amazing child stars from \"Stranger Things,\" \"It,\" or \"Jungle Book.\"Overall: The movie is mainly geared towards elementary and middle school children with some adult aspects, yet the movie is childish and not up to Disney's standard. Disney should be embarrassed to have produced such a movie with big Hollywood names and have it bomb. The movie falls flat and lacks humor leading to a failure for Disney. Even though this movie is supposed to be a big statement towards diversity with a colored director helming a $100 million budget project, the movie does not do justice.2/5",

Oprah Winfrey cannot act; neither can anyone else in this Billy Mumy wannabe ripoff. Give me the Twilight Zone episode with Mumy for 25 minutes over this cornball crap. Aside from the terrible story line; a man gives up his supposedly happy home life for years discovering the cosmos and travel at faster than lightspeed. Please; give me Buzz Lightyear for infinity and beyond instead of this lame wuss who cant even discipline his six year old child. What an idiotic storyline; overly simplistic and sugar-coated to the extent you will get Diabetes if you watch the entire film. Don't even get into the racial insults implied in the film. White man with high yeller woman is fine; it can happen. Nothing wrong with that. But to have your daughter prefer a white man, and then the sequence where the little boy prefers a high yeller girl companion indicates a fairly strong disregard of sensitivity for two entire groups: black men and white women. Both groups are excluded from any relationships in the film. All the white girls are bad, and there isn't one positive black man in the film. Nice way to promote racial integration. How ironic that a film that tries to be PC is horribly NOT PC. But the bottom line is that it really is a crappy film.",

He figured a way to travel the universe with his mind but was laughed at by his colleagues. Everyone believes that he had ran away from his family. Meg has the support of her younger brother Charles Wallace and adoring classmate Calvin O'Keefe. Charles Wallace is in contact with three mysterious strangers, Mrs. Whatsit (Reese Witherspoon), Mrs. Who (Mindy Kaling), and Mrs. Which (Oprah Winfrey). They use tesseract to transport the kids to the planet Uriel. There they track Meg's missing father to the dangerous planet Camazotz controlled by a darkness called The IT which is spreading to control the universe.I checked out the 2003 movie before watching this although I won't be reading the book. In that movie, I didn't care much about the three ladies. In this one, at least they're a little better. The use of CGI helps liven up that section and I do like the flowers very much. It's Camazotz where this version falls completely flat with many issues. This Camazotz lacks the threatening darkness world construction. I don't see how a crowded beach be a threatening setting and the holodeck lacks reality. Charles Wallace does not get seduced by The IT like in 2003 as much as he's kidnapped and brainwashed. It's a less compelling interpretation. As for the other two kids, Calvin is nothing more than a puppy love teen who says some awkward unkid-like stuff. I look forward to Storm Reid being an interesting actress in the future. In this, there are a couple of directing mistakes and she does her best to overcome them. In general, her adventures are little more than word salads being spun out by the three ladies. They are great ideas but this movie struggles to visually put it onto the screen. The premise is similar to the much better children's adventure NeverEnding Story but this one concentrates more on the three Hollywood powerhouse stars rather than an enchanting adventure.",

I feel that if I had read the book it might fill in a lot of the stuff it appears to have missed. It just kind of skimmed through the story. Too much time spent on trying to make it look cool and be emotional over actually making the story work. I was thoroughly disappointed.

Was it part of a multi-movie contractual agreement? Did they let you read the script before you committed? Why?\" I'm guessing this film started off as a low budget Disney original movie that got upgraded to the big screen for ... reasons. The CGI is distracting and doesn't enhance. The dialogue seems to be written by a 6 year old with an overly simplistic outlook on life. The characters one dimensional. I'm unfamiliar with the 1962 novel so maybe it's hampered by trying to be a faithful recreation ...?This film got on my radar many months ago because of some commentary around the diversity of those involved in its production.

Sadly to no avail. Disney have done so many very good to masterpiece films, but with 'A Wrinkle in Time' they have misfired...big time. It hurts me a lot to describe a Disney film as terrible, a distinction very rarely associated with them, but that is a very good way to sum up 'A Wrinkle in Time'. That it is a poor adaptation of the book, which had far more wonder and charm not to mention coherence, is a problem, but not as big a problem as the major flaws that make the film terrible on its own terms. The spirited performance of Storm Reid, who makes a real effort giving her role energy and likeability and does quite well, and that from Chris Pine are the only things that stop 'A Wrinkle in Time' from being an even bigger disaster.Cannot say the same for the rest of the cast. Questioned a good deal of the casting choices before watching the film, having doubts that they would suit their roles. Doubts that were proven correct. The other children don't have strong enough presences and inexperience shows, but the adult actors fare worse. On one side of the spectrum you have very exaggerated, annoying acting, Mindy Kaling being a prime example, and on the other you have truly insipid and phoned in acting, the biggest offender being Oprah Winfrey. Didn't care for the characters and the conflict doesn't work when the heroes are bland and lack charm generally and the villains are exaggerated and lack menace. 'A Wrinkle in Time' doesn't even look good, with it looking worse than a low-budget television film (Disney Channel musicals look better!). The effects (of which there is too much of an over-reliance on) are worse than cheap, worse than those from fantasy/magic-themed family shows from twenty plus years ago, and marred further by photography and editing that will make one nauseated. The sets are colourful but not in a vibrant or appealing way, rather tacky and garish. And why Winfrey, Kaling and Reese Witherspoon (also annoying) were made to look like drag queens or something out of a cheesy 80s music video is beyond my understanding, by far the worst cases of costuming, make-up and hair in a film taking bizarre to extremes in that aspect. Nothing dynamic, whimsical, energetic, nuanced or atmospheric about the music. Much of it doesn't fit, and it's either saccharine, over-bearing or tacky, in its own right it doesn't appeal. Was expecting much better directing from the same director responsible for 'Selma', it was very muddled and it was hard to tell whether her heart was in it or whether she was taking on more than she could chew (am suspecting both).Excepting Reid's and Pine's characters, the only characters to have some kind of heart, the characters generally bore and irritate. The script and story are particularly bad, with the script falling on the wrong side frequently of cheesy, awkward and twee complete with heavy-handed moralising. The message is an admirable one but beats the viewer around the head to the point one feels preached at. The pace feels both rushed and flagging, with the action rarely coming to life let alone soaring.The story tries to be ambitious but there is too much of a too hard feel, trying to fit in too much and not having a long enough running time to tell it. There was a heart somewhere in the film and it's occasionally there with the whole finding-father stuff, but that is lost amidst all the above stated problems and that the story is far too choppy that it affects the coherence and sometimes ridiculous. Detected very little charm here and actually felt more tired by the film rather than enchanted. Overall, excepting two performances 'A Wrinkle of Time' was a mess and a rare Disney misfire. 2/10 Bethany Cox",

I'm going to try to keep this as spoiler free as possible so bear with me.First off, anyone that complains about changing the ethnicity of the lead character get over it. Storm Reid is servicable in this role and I can easily see her as Meg. Chris Pine dominates every scene that he's in, as does Gugu Mbatha Raw.Here's where the problems start....When I read this book, and it was written in the 1960s so I'll grant that some stuff just wasn't there back then, the Madeline L'engle was at least somewhat subtle with the message she was writing between the lines.This movie isn't subtle. This movie takes it's message and beats you in the face with it over, and over again.I get the fact that this is aimed at younger kids, but you really don't need to narrate everything that is happening, or should or will happen. I kept thinking that maybe there was a reason that the adults(not the parents) were phoning in their lines but there really wasn't. The costumes of the three Mrs. characters, when taken out of the previews just look silly. Meg is basically turned into an ersatz audience member where she's just led around being told what to do. I think that with a slightly better script, Ms. Reid would have really been allowed to shine here. She has some potential that isn't really tapped here. I hate to say, but I think that the directors picked her because she looked like she could be the child of the parents more than over her acting ability. That in itself is a real shame, because given the right role, Storm Reid could be fantastic.Zach Galifianikis is completely wasted here. So is Oprah Winfrey, and Reese Whitherspoon. Mindy Kailing seemed like she was trying to outdo everyone, maybe because she's used to being in tv. I don't know. A lot of the acting just felt forced.Green screen is used and abused in this film. The first world they go to is amazing, the second interesting, but the whole time I kept thinking that they were going to flash a hitpoint gauge on the screen or prompt me for a quicktime event. There's such a thing as too much CGI and this movie is a poster child for that. Maybe some more work to clean things up would have helped. Maybe not.Had they stuck to the book more closely I think it would have been a much better film. The early 2000's had a TV movie that I found myself liking more and it was done for a fraction of the budget here.",

It doesn't even attempt to remain true to what the book is truly about.First of all, the book is a Christian fantasy, written by a Christian author, Madeleine L'Engle. The movie ignores L'Engle's faith to the point of mockery. To add insult to injury, the movie doesn't even try to add in something that might satisfy in it's place. Not that anything could, but an attempt would have taken away a bit of the sting. Instead, we're left with banal generics about \"light,\" \"darkness,\" and the \"universe,\" with some daytime pop psychology mixed in. For an example, the movie has Mrs. Which, played by Oprah Winfrey, say \"The only thing faster than the speed of light is the speed of darkness.\" What rubbish! I genuinely hate that line. Theologically, even just morally, it's garbage. Light doesn't have to outrun the dark. Good is not weaker than evil. The smallest speck of light is enough to brighten the most encompassing darkness. That's the message we should be sending children, not some banal quip that makes evil seem stronger than it really is. The movie's fatal flaw is shown mainly in the characters, but also a bit in how the plot was handled. I'll start with the characters, but I want to say something first. I don't agree with those who say the acting was bad. The diverse cast was mostly wonderful! But, even the most talented actor can only do so much, with a bad script. The cast did the best that probably could be done with what they were given. Sadly, what they were given was trash. That isn't their fault though. Chris Pine played Alex Murray, a character horrible misinterpreted by the movie. In the book, Murray is a renowned and VERY well-respected scientist, not some outsider on the fringes of his field. This is a man who is consulted by the President, at times! His work with the tesseract was a group effort with other scientists, not just his wife. The movie utterly trashed his motives for developing the tesseract. He didn't want to \"shake hands with the universe,\" whatever that means. Murray in the book was a man of faith, working for the good of his fellow men. The tesseract was supposed to help people, not just fulfill some personal agenda. Murray in the book took risks, yes, but as part of his responsibilities to his team and country. Equally flawed was the movie's version of Mrs. Whatsit. In the book, Mrs. Whatsit is, frankly, an angel, who used to be a star, before sacrificing herself in a battle against evil...a battle she won. She was a fun character, though, playing a game at being human. She dressed as an old tramp and stole sheets. The sheets in the book, though, weren't stolen to create some magnificent robe for her to look beautiful in, for her vanity. Nope. In the book, she took the sheets to make cheesy ghosts, in order to scare people away from the haunted house. The worst thing about the movie Mrs. Whatsit was how she treated Meg. Consistently and frequently through the movie, Mrs. Whatsit bullied and belittled Meg, showing intense dislike and openly wishing she wasn't there. What an incredibly terrible message to send! This is supposed to be a wise leader, teacher, and guide, but that's how she treats a child? Compare that to the book, where Mrs. Whatsit is playful and gentle, where Mrs. Whatsit's assurance of her love is instrumental in Meg defeating It. I'm a fan of Reese Witherspoon, but she was so wrong here. Frankly, Kathy Bates would have been a much better choice. Another character who should have been happy, playful, and kind was the Happy Medium. Zach Galifianakis played the role as a grump, for whatever reason. Frankly, this is the role Michael Pe\u00f1a should have played. His comedy style would have been perfect for a well-meaning seer trying to show the kids comforting things, their mothers, and instead showing them scenes of pain, as it was in the book. I don't know why they got rid of this bit of character development in favor of CGI crap about balancing on rocks. It's just one time of many, where something deep was replaced with something shallow. Zach Galifianakis could play the Man with Red Eyes, if he can pull off legal evil, a creepy bureacrat, with a deep sense of menace, highlighted by a fake cheerfulness. Finally, we get to Charles Wallace. And, yes, he should be called that, not Charles or Charlie, no. He's Charles Wallace, because it shows he's not ordinary. In the book, Charles Wallace is a gentle, thoughtful child, who very often knows what his sister is thinking and feeling. He's a boy who listens. This is a very important part of his character. He has a wisdom to him that is far beyond his years. He's not a typical kid who screams and yells, when someone is being mean to his sister. Charles Wallace barely talks in front of other people at all! There should be something otherworldly about the boy. Instead, McCabe was directed to play him as a bit wild and mouthy and Charles Wallace's wisdom, understanding, and intelligence were barely shown at all. Not only is this a sad waste of his character, but makes the sequels impossible to get right. They made the classic mistake of telling us Charles Wallace is special, instead of showing us. Poor Calvin. They didn't so much get his character wrong, as fail to give him character at all. He was just undeveloped. Of course, they ruined the possibility of a good adaptation of A Swiftly Tilting Planet, the third in L'Engle's trilogy, by changing his home life from a poor family, with lots of kids, to him being an only child with just a dad. The only character treated worse was Aunt Beast, who was left out entirely, which is shame. Well, they also left out Sandy and Denys, the Murray twins. A single scene with them would have been just fine. As for the plot, I think a single example will highlight how wrong the movie went. In the book, the children arrive on Camazotz. They walk through a suburban neighborhood and see children \"playing.\" The boys are bouncing balls and girls and skipping rope, all simultaneously to a certain \"rhythm.\" Yes, the movie almost gets that much right. The children see that one child alone is out of rhythm, dropping his ball and unable to keep in sync. When the mother's call the children in, the errant child leaves his ball behind. They try to return the ball and the mother is terrified. She assures Meg and the others that there haven't been any \"incidents,\" in a long time. The reader sees that although everything looks neat and tidy, no one is really happy. Submission to evil brings terror and pain, not joy. This deep, potentially moving scene is reduced to make room for a shallow, unnecessary scene where a CGI forest attacks the kids. Speaking of out of character, the entire planet of Camazotz is exactly that. There would not a beach scene like that on Camazotz. Camazotz is legal evil, all the way. The evil of Camazotz does not play those sorts of mind games. It doesn't so much try and confuse you, as try to get you to confuse yourself. In the movie, the children are given a meal, by the Man with Red Eyes. They are given some sort of nutrient base, but the Man can create the illusion of a turkey dinner. Charles Wallace, however, can't be fooled, and knows the meal is shapeless and tasteless, like sand. They weren't actually given sand to eat. The meal did what a meal should do, at least on the surface. It provided nutrition, but without real joy. It was body fuel, with everything better about it drained away. For me, that's the perfect metaphor for this movie, as opposed to the book. The movie tells the story and kills some time, but with all the real joy of the story neglected and ignored.I really wished they had done a good job. I wanted to like this movie, so much. When you make a beloved novel into a movie, you have an automatic audience in the fans of the book. Integrity demands you give that audience what you are promising them. This movie fails to deliver.",

            "content": "I didn't even want to see this to begin with. But I was dragged by people who only wanted to see if because Reese Witherspoon is in it. So to begin with.. the plot is not good. There hardly even is one. The special effects were mediocre but not horrible.. the characters were two dimensional and you can't really connect to them. I don't even understand the point of Calvinother than Meg's love interest. But WHY DOES SHE NEED A LOVE INTEREST. She is a child and while she may have a crush, there is no need for there to be a romantic storyline within this movie. Charles Wallace mentioned that he cane along for diplomacy, but where do we even see that come into play? Meg is just dragging him along the whole time. And on that topic, how does Charles Wallace know all of this stuff. Sure, he's a smart kid, but are we supposed to believe he's psychic or something? And he can just summon the universe? Also, why is the universe so concerned with them? Don't they have other things to spend their time on? So anyways.. the three Mrs show up and oprah's Character is like 20ft taller than everyone else.. why? Because she's oprah, that's why... and that cheapens the feel of the movie. We get it.. you're Oprah. So then they go to this magical land and find out what direction her dad went. So the Reese Witherspoon changes into some giant flying creature so they can go look for their father. But the director focused on the magic of flying and the fun of it that we lost the point of even being up there. There was literally no point to that entire scene other than to put in some \"cool\" special effects. They saw \"the darkness\" though. It's supposedly \"pure evil.\" How pure of an evil can it really be in a PG Disney movie... huh? Anyways, they meet Zach galifinakis to help find their father. (Also, why wouldn't the Mrs be able to find him or help meg find him if they are literally the universe with a bunch of magical powers??) anywho.. galifinakis shows a vision of her dad discovering love is the frequency needed in order to terrasect. (If that's the case, how do people NOT terrasect). And that he went into the darkness. So suddenly the darkness is it's own planet? And Meg risks the lives of THE UNIVERSE in order to go into the darkness.. because that's a good idea. So she gets tested by the darkness and meg is the only one who can resist it.. what happened to Charles Wallace being the all-knowing leader of the group? He falls under the spell of the darkness almost immediately. And also, why was he already across the wall? Did it not fit their \"love story\" plot to have a young(er) child intervene? So now Charles Wallace is evil and suddenly has magical powers. But again.. how evil can he be in a Disney movie? Not very.. and that makes it laughable. So meg again passes more tests and finds her father. Who hasn't aged a day, his beard hasn't grown, and has survived in a small room with nothing? What did he eat? Where did he go to the bathroom? Then all of the sudden the darkness REALLY wants meg and just meg. (Again I wonder why such a powerful being would be so interested in these specific children) and meg gets tested some more. All of this just being a lesson to teach her to love herself, to have self esteem. And that's the cure. That's what strongly weakens the darkness. Again... why does the universe (light and dark) care SO MUCH about one little girl's self esteem. Then the three Mrs tell meg that she's the next \"great person\" in line with ghandi, Marie curie, and various others. Just because she knows basic physics, can figure out a puzzle, and loves herself??? Also, another thing I forgot to mention,; Mrs who can only speak in quotes because she's not strong enough to speak her own thoughts. Then when they are on the darkness' planet, she speaks her own words and oprah explains that it's because the planet is making her weak.... so how does that make sense????? Anyways. It was a horrible movie with tons of plot holes and a really bad plot line. The director focused more on the special affects and costumes than she did on a script, plot, or acting. But hey.. oprah is in it.",

            "content": "A Wrinkle in Time has everything it needs (for its intended audience to ignore that it's as riveting to look at as any movie with similar effects). And by \"everything\", I don't exclusively mean a godlike Oprah Winfrey. Say what you will about the current state of Disney; they still know how to make successes and are good at adapting to, let's say, \"climate change\". Speaking of nothing, woman of color (sic) Ava DuVernay directs the movie, and it is probably of little shock to anyone that I think 13th was better.The film, based on a similarly named book I had previously not heard of, stars Storm Reid as the young Meg, who voyages into the universe with her little brother (Deric McCabe) and a schoolmate (Levi Miller of Pan) to find her lost father, an astrophysicist played by Chris Pine.Also at her side are three space-traveling entities wearing varying degrees of glitter and concentrated goofiness. There is Mindy Kaling as Mrs. Who (which is not a Jodie Whitaker reference), Reese Witherspoon as Mrs. Whatsit (which is certainly not a Homestar Runner reference), and last but the opposite of least there is Oprah as Mrs. Which.I don't need to elaborate. Oprah, the best person in the world barring possibly Rihanna and Beyonc\u00e9, portrays a powerful alien sorceress who, like her two companions, symbolizes light and ultimate goodness. As old as this book is, few things could be more timely. Somewhere a Trump fan is seething.Our heroes move through unmercifully digital realms (that seem just as convincing to them as they do to us) and see all sorts of creatures, where even the most interestingly designed one looks suspiciously similar to The Tooth Fairy from Rise of the Guardians. In the supporting cast we see Gugu Mbatha-Raw as Meg's mother, Zach Galifianakis as a Happy Medium, as well as David Oyelowo, Michael Pe\u00f1a and others who do not have anything exceptional to offer outside of laughable, outright random costumes.Sometimes the film is a love story between youngsters, sometimes it is comical, sometimes it sets out to be a little more epic and emotionally brutal than the design choices, performances, and cutesy interludes permit. Online posts explain that A Wrinkle in Time (originally penned by Madeleine L'Engle) is a difficult book to adapt; perhaps the changes in tone went over more smoothly in the source material. I, for one, will never know.If this is your first time seeing images, worlds, and special effects like these, as is most surely the case when a kid watches this, I suppose I don't see a problem. But I know adults who are impressed by the movie, so I took the time to join a theater-going party so that I could offer up my two cents; or counter-points, as it turns out. If you're going to praise the film because of the originality of its images, I shall point to the similarities it shares with the visuals of movies like Avatar, the lesser Alice adaptations, and even Transformers: The Last Knight (I swear, even Chris Pine's prison was just The Alchemist's hallway from The Holy Mountain renovated).What else allegedly makes the film interesting? Well, the cast is a rich blend of unemotive children and half-assing professionals, and the movie does set itself apart from others like it in how it focuses on kids and the emotions they struggle with. Critics have praised the considerable diversity of the cast also - like you needed me to tell you that - which is fine and good. They were mostly just saying their lines the way any other performer could have done, but again: fine and good. Good and fine.Regardless, A Wrinkle in Time is not as hard-hitting or enchantingly otherworldly as it insists on being (I never felt convinced by the CGI, for instance, in spite of it technically being well-rendered). Like any other recent Disney movie, it feels safe and manufactured, sans the odd moment of accidental sincerity. I realize it's not for me. And thank God for that.",

            "content": "What a fascinating mess. It's the first time a black female director has helmed a 100+ mil blockbuster, and Duvernay isn't messing around; it is full of candy-coated visuals and enough standing-around-and-expositioning to make Burton's Alice in Wonderland shake its head. She single handedly proves in fact that a fierce black lady can make just as much of a wondrous debacle as white men have done for decades. And yet...So much doesnt make sense though - the rules of the \"It\" change based on whatever the next scene requires of it (including a delightfully mind-boggling bit part for Michael Pena - seriously, this better show up on his honorary Oscar reel one day) - and it is so sincere in its performances and tone that it doesn't see when it's sincerely dumb. The pacing is also off, perhaps due to studio interference, but how then to explain the sudden shift from a serious scene between mother and daughter about the missing-for-four-years Chris Pine ... Right into Reese Witherspoon being there in the living room doing her darndest to be the next Glenda the Good Witch. Huh?Ive heard a couple of reviews compare this to Return to Oz, which was itself a Disney movie taking off from famous source material and going in a much different direction. But Murch, for all of his movie's faults, was really taking chances with his dark tone with the material and things felt organic to the world that gets set up. No, this is closer to something like David Lynch's Dune (also a rather notorious adaptation of a hallowed \"unfilmable\" classic); this is a movie that throws a LOT at the audience very quickly, and while the imagination visually is often breathtaking, and I think Duvernay has some truly crazy imagery ready to give her VFX people to realize for her and us, narratively it is full of information and yet emotionally it's just not there.... No. That's not entirely true or fair, there is an emotional point to all of this, and it's a loaf of hippie-dippie crap. Again, having not read the book, I have to take what the movie gives me, but I've heard that originally there was more Christian symbolism and meaning for why things were happening and rules and so on. Instead of that (if there is any Christian symbolism I totally missed it), we get the kind of message I expect in a Care Bears movie: it's all about love. Literally. It doesn't hold water and moreover it also leads to excuses for the problems in the secondary characters: for children this is a bad lesson, that this nebulous concept of trying to love people more will magically lead to people overcoming their flaws, which is all coming from \"The It\". For all that Duvernay tries to lay the groundwork for all of this to take off, she also presides over more boring CGI and visual locations than not (some do stand out and if one day this becomes for the kids today a stoner cult film for when they go to college), and the climax is hollow. This isn't to say there aren't some decent things to find here - Reid, Mbatha Raw and Pine (the latter two with too few scenes) are quite good and do what they can with their material - but all of the incoherence in the storytelling, in what is too much and simultaneous too little, and a weak message amid the colorful sights and lame musical sounds (those songs will date the film terribly), it all adds up to full blown WTF mainstream cinema.",

The whole thing is a confusing mess, they were not able to transfer the profound message of the book to the screen, it totally got lost. The cast, well, nothing to say other than they are overdoing the 'diversity' thing now and the pc stuff. This book was not written about a bi racial family with an adopted Asian boy; it was written about a girl with 'flaming red hair' i.e. Meg and her white family. Why do we have to make EVERYTHING about race these days? I thought when I saw Oprah in it that there might be a problem but I loved the book so much I was willing to take a chance on the movie. Just hope they don't make the other two books in the series into movies; please don't waste the money and don't waste your time seeing this movie either, just read the book and leave it at that.",

            "content": "There is so much to say about A Wrinkle in Time I don't even know where to start. I guess I should start by saying that I didn't read the book. Even though I didn't read the book that should not have a significant bearing upon my enjoyment of the movie because there are plenty of movies I've watched without having read the associated book yet I enjoyed them.Since we're on the vein of the movie being a book lets start with the storyline. Although I understood it, it was not well done. The story was very scattered and disconnected. Characters just appeared with no rhyme or reason and there was very little explanation given to their presence. One character, Calvin (Levi Miller), was wholly unnecessary. I'm assuming he had a role in the book but in the movie his role was pointless. Along with characters materializing from the Hollywood ether the story itself never had a real flow or cohesion. The movie jumped from one scene to the next without a segue or proper transition. I think it was assumed that everyone is familiar with the story and should therefore be familiar with all that is going on.The essence of the story, as I gathered, was a girl who'd essentially given up on herself after her dad disappeared was given a chance to find her missing father. Finding her father would make her whole again and all would be right with the world. Her father, by the way, was missing somewhere in the universe. If he was missing in Los Angeles that'd be a tall enough task without any real leads, but he was missing in THE UNIVERSE and the girl didn't have much to go on. Her journey takes her all over and again I saw no strong reason for going to the places they went. Without revealing too much the movie built to a climax as all movies do then it fizzled. The climax itself wasn't much to begin with but then it fizzled from there largely because of how sappy and cliche the resolution was.What was disappointing--if I can say I was disappointed--was that there were so many well known actors in this movie and they were wasted. No, I don't mean they were drunk, I mean their talents were wasted. Everything seem so staged and scripted. Nothing was organic or natural, from the scenery to the dialog to their very movements, nothing seemed instinctive. They all seemed like they were waiting for a cue to deliver their lines or move. And the worst of them was Charles Wallace (Deric McCabe). If this was his debut role I hope he isn't ruined by it. His character seemed the most hollow and staged. Every line he delivered seemed rehearsed.The incredibly sappy, cliche, disconnected story, and the acting led to serious boredom. I wanted to like it--I truly did--but I couldn't find much to like. It was colorful, that's about all I can say. I can't even credit the movie much for the scenery and special effects because it wasn't that special. There was nothing groundbreaking or unique in that department. Honestly, this movie would have been better off being a Disney Channel release for kids to watch after school.",

Okay, maybe a part of it has something to do with it being based on a book, and also my brother wanted to see it (not that he knew anything about it anyway), but in the end it was one of those painfully annoying Disney films that left me bored out of my brains the entire time.\n Basically it is about a couple of kids, one of them a young teenager, another a child, whose parents are scientists. Anyway, they Dad goes missing so not surprisingly they become very difficult students (not to mention that they also attract the ire of their peers). However, out of the blue, these magical women appear (good witches if you will), who take them on a journey across the universe in an attempt to find their father, only to discover that there is this nameless evil that basically makes everybody behave like jerks.\n I guess you can see where this is going - they defeat this nameless evil (which is call the It - see, I told you it was a nameless evil), and then find their father, and they all go back to playing happy families. All the while, the bullies stop being bullies because, well, nameless evil, and the random boy that decided to join their group because he had this urge to just leave his house and start wondering around a part of the town he never goes to because, well, plot point, finally plucks up the courage to go back home and confront his abusive father (like, that ever works in real life).\n I told my brother that it was a fantasy movie, and yes, you could say that it pretty much exists in the realm of fantasy, because I doubt abusive fathers suddenly have a change of heart just because their son decides to stand up to them, and bullies don't stop being bullies because some nameless and unidentified evil is destroyed because, well, love is supposed to conquer all, and that works out because some person just screams out 'I love you' over and over again, and the nameless evil stops being evil and turns into sunshine and lollypops because, well, that's what happens when you start screaming out 'I love you' over and over again.\n Well, if you get the impression that I didn't like this movie, then you're not wrong there. In fact I won't even go as far as calling it a fairy tale because, well, that sort of ruins it for some of the really cool fairy tales out there. Nah, I'll just call this a Disney film and leave it at that, though I do have to admit that while they have made some absolute gems, in the end, a lot of their stuff is just cliched and rubbish.",

A genuine turkey, this is the film to beat when it comes to the title of worst film of 2018.\u00bd a giant Oprah out of 5",

An exercise in doing, saying & being too much, Wrinkle... certainly isn't boring, but it is bad. \nIt has a lot in common with Tomorrowland: live-action, visually-heavy Disney fantasy-adventures, headed by lauded filmmakers, which celebrate braininess. But where Tomorrowland was simply misguided, Wrinkle... is a straight-up disaster. It gets credit for being Disney's most enigmatic, eccentric experiments in years, taking visual and philosophical cues from Jodorowsky and Kubrick. Unfortunately, all intended awe and wonder is swallowed up by good, old-fashioned ineptness.\nThe story of a girl having to \"tesser\" across the universe to find her long-lost dad gets some things right, including the critical casting of the lead girl. Unfortunately, this engaging young actress can't quite right this time-traveling ship. The rest of the oddly-casted actors certainly don't help. Galifianakis plays a god-like being doing modern, self-aware schtick for some reason (\"I like earthtones.\"); Witherspoon's comic-relief is more annoyingly repetitve than funny; brilliant ad-libber Kaling is forced into delivering constant platitudes; and deus-ex-Oprah leans into stoicism instead of inspiration. \nThese obnoxious side-characters disappear eventually, and the film gets better for it, with potent descriptions of the evil \"It\" and some great, creepy suburban set-pieces. But it's really too late at that point. So much has gone wrong in so many ways (clunky editing, awful exposition, abrasive music, unearned emotions, prescription drug commercial graphics, ill-timed humor, laughable performances, etc), blame must be placed on normally stellar director DuVernay (Selma) for how unwieldy the final product feels.

            "content": "I'll start off by flat out saying that I have not read the books, therefore I will be judging this movie in isolation. That is of course how I believe that all book adaptations should be judged, for what they are. Sadly, this movie in and of itself is legitimately bad.Starting with the positive, I did enjoy some of the cinematography and special effects. However, the movies fails to even be consistent with this, far too much of it feels unfortunately bland for the absurdity of what they're tackling in this movie, which in contrast with the absurdity of this movie, makes the absurdity feel out of place. They're mixed attempts at grounded storytelling and ridiculous storytelling make for a weird dosage. As you can see I've already dived into negatives, because I've sadly already named the positives.This movie tries way too often to be serious, having dark and dramatic scenes that just don't work. The reason they don't work is because half the movie tries to be silly, while the other half relies on us caring. Which I simply don't. Not only does much of the goofy side of this movie come off as annoying, but there isn't enough realism and relatability in characters for me to care about them when the movie does get dramatic.As far as the characters, the flaws come out both from the performances and the writing. So much so that the lines begin to get blurry where the flaws are emitting from, thus I have difficulty pinpointing precisely what is wrong with the characters. But every single character in this movies has flaws.Our three main protagonists in this movie are played by child actors, which is often where movies take a wrong step. I think Storm Reid gave a fine performance, but ultimately her character felt bland. I feel that if she had been given more to do in this movie it would've helped her to stand out. Deric McCabe does poorly, I believe he was miscast in this role, although most of the scenes that really don't work for him would be hard for any child actor to pull off. Also his scenes where he had very little to do felt strangely off, as though he just wasn't up to the task yet. I believe that he was absolutely miscast in this role, and it's possible that it could've been done well by another actor. I believe Levi Miller does fine, but his character ultimately felt far too bland, and when he didn't feel bland he felt weird, but not in an endearing way, in a slightly creepy or offbeat way that just failed. Let's just say that our supporting characters are just as all over the place as our main three, they don't get better.The reason I have yet to mention the plot of this movie yet, is that I might be forgiven for forgetting one was attempted. It is straightforward, predictable, generic, but its biggest crime is that it is forgettable. It's not exactly terrible, although in parts bad, it just fails to be memorable.This movie was absolutely all over the place, from strange attempts at being creepy, which ultimately came across accidentally hilarious, to bizarre attempts at extremely cheesy messages that fell flat on their face. The unintentionally humorous moments made this movie easier to watch, and fortunately my experience was not aggressively annoying. That being said, this movie is genuinely bad, there's hardly anything good in it. Save your two hours and do something else with your life, this one just isn't worth it.",

Along with her brother Charles Wallace? Charles Wallace, Charles Wallace? Charles Wallace! Charles Wallace, Charles Wallace, Charles Wallace! Charles Wallace? (Deric McCabe) and a neighbourhood boy Calvin (Levi Miller) who wanders into the plot by accident, they travel the galaxy trying to retrace her fathers movements.I only realised at the end credits that this was another movie that Disney adapted from the work of Madeleine L'Engle and after this, and the awful \"A Ring Of Endless Light\" adaptation that I had to sit through a couple of weeks back, I'm glad there aren't any more. It's a shame that all of the criticism for the film seemed to land on Ave DuVernay's lap - when the flaws with this film mostly lie with its terrible story. It's a nonsensical and boring plot which isn't interested in it's sci-fi trappings despite bothering to explain them in great detail, instead favouring a painfully on the nose metaphor for not giving in to ones darker and more destructive feelings.Which is not to say that the films production gets away scot-free. Some CGI moments are better than others and it's pacing is all wrong. It's doesn't do a good job of explaining what people's motivations are - certainly in the last third, or what the villain actually wants, or why it switches from an ethereal evil - to a specific possession element. Scenes happen, and then are walked away from without progressing the plot. Performances aren't great, though the kids are better than the adults in this regard, but the most annoying aspect of the film though was to have a character called \"Charles Wallace\" and then to have other characters repeatedly shout both sections of the name over and over again as they look for him.It's looking to be a \"Wizard of Oz-esque\" magical experience, but it doesn't have a story to offset its painfully twee whimsy.

But you can't make up for the fundamental flaws. The movie fails to convey a clear story, and completely misses a key part of the original story in its rush to get Meg and company home. An example of how this movie could have been made? Look no further than the Wizard of Oz which is an adaptation of a book, involves a young girl on a journey, a fantasy world, with munchkins , talking trees, good and bad witches, a yellow brick road, a mission, several and a yearning to return home. It has strong characters, a clear story, a pivotal crisis, and an ending. Its special effects are limited to a spinning house and a melting witch.Cut the gimmicks, and back to a simple framework: key characters, key moments, key emotions, and tell the story with the strong voice of a little girl who is a torrent of emotion and who with the help of a classic trio: three wonderful witches, courageously acts in the face of fear.",

And no, its not because I didn't understand the overall meaning but rather the slip shod way the narrative tried to portray it. It's just jam packed with Maguffins with the odd sprinkling of real science to try and give it some legitimacy. And plot holes..so, so many! I think what realy annoyed me though was the PS1 type CGI flying lettuce. And the way the characters kept calling the kid \"Charles Wallace\". Is that his name cos that ain't a name. Really annoyed me for some weird reason. What really annoyed me though was the way the film portrayed horrific human behaviour as the influence of some alien entity.

As long as the director and screenwriters are talented storytellers if they are personally passionate about the source material the difference is usually massive (see Battlefield Earth for an example of passion for the story but no storytelling talent at director/screenwriter). One clear contrast of this is Peter Jackson's 'Lord of the Rings' trilogy (2001-2003), who was personally passionate about the source material, compared to the 'Chronicles of Narnia' trilogy (2005-2010) where that was missing: IMDB avg: LOTR 8.8 vs. CofN 6.6Rotten Tomatoes avg: LOTR 93% vs 64%U.S. Gross avg (adj. for infl.): LOTR $530m vs. CofN $238mSo, I think the ratings for 'A Wrinkle in Time' point to a lack of passion for the source material and the resultant quality of the movie: IMDB 4.2, Rotten Tomatoes 42 (RT audience score even lower at 35%).",

Some of the changes didn't make sense to me were they trying to make this story more exciting than it was in the book?First off, the bond between Charles Wallace and Meg was totally lost in this movie. I kept waiting for it during the warming the milk scene and it never materialized. Then the whole thing about the forests popping up, the whirlwind and the wall in Kamozots was entirely fabricated. Why? Then the kids that were playing ball, there was a kid that was doing the ball thing erratically. They later see him being \"rehabilitated\". This whole thing was left out. And it was important because Meg had a speech at the end that talked about the difference between being the same and being equal that was very powerful. This was left out. Then the dad left which made him look like an ass, but that didn't happen in the book. Yes, it was Megs love that saved Charles Wallace, but how they got there was wrong. I was also disappointed that they left out the humor of the happy medium, who was really happy. All in all, I think they missed some of the key messages that then get built upon in later books.",

It attempts to be Life of Pi but lacks the depth and conflict. There is nothing at stake for the character, and the villain is not at all menacing. The supporting cast led by Oprah Winfrey was brilliant though. Oprah reminds us that she was once and still is a bona fide actor. But the scene stealer is Mindy Kaling as Mrs Who. She is radiant. Storm Reid as the Meg is too annoying in the beginning to be likable, but she does have talent. The other child stars are bland. In short, as a movie fan, I rarely find a movie boring, but this is one of those boring movies. It is full of spectacle but lacking so much of plot or depth and the graces of Oprah Winfrey, Reese Witherspoon, Chris Pine, Michael Pena, Zach Galifianakilis cannot save this movie. In other words, this is a flop waiting to happen",

Directed by Ava DuVernay (Selma), it is an unfortunate mess of storytelling and uninvolving plotting.Meg Murry (Storm Reid) is a young girl trying to fit in at school four years after the strange disappearance of her scientist father (Chris Pine). One day, three mysterious women, Mrs. Whatsit (Reese Witherspoon), Mrs. Who (Mindy Kaling), and Mrs. Which (Oprah Winfrey) appear at Meg's house and offer to help find her missing father, who is believed to be somewhere on a faraway world.Having not read the novel from which it was based, I have no idea how accurately this film adaptation follows the original source material. However, with this in mind, the film seems to be a jumbled mess of overdone CGI, uninteresting action, and forced poignancy. The film's script feels all over the place and there are a number of plot holes which are never resolved and are brushed under the carpet for the sake of moving the film along and pad out its runtime. In addition to this, none of the characters were particularly interesting and the story was uninvolving and often boring. This is one of those films that you are highly likely to forget you have watched it in a matter of days.I rate it 3/10",

That's often noticed in scenes which feature conversations between characters. I felt if I was watching documentary or something, and that made me so confused and I really felt uneasy. There are tons of plot holes and unexplained things from the get-go to the end of the movie. But most of the nonsensical things happened to be related to the character of Charles Wallace. Charles Wallace is a very bizarre character. This character and everything related to it don't make any sense ,alas, Charles Wallace is really a big deal in the story and its messy plot. To add insult to injury, the child who played this character, Deric McCabe, is a very bad actor; for a big part of the movie he was trying to act like a cool sweet young kid, but he is not, then we see him overacting. I wonder if this character, Charles Wallace, is also poorly written in the novel? Mrs. Which, Whatsit, and Who characters have many cringe-worthy moments, and I blame no one but the director, Ava DuVernay, and maybe also Mindy Kaling (Mr. Who) who I should blame; what an annoying character and infuriating performance from Mindy Kaling!I don't have so much to say about Zach Galifianakis or Pe\u00f1a's performances, but I didn't neither like their characters.I think Storm Reid who played Meg, the protagonist, did a really god job. But the only performance that I can really praise is Chris Pine as Meg's father; he is great and due to his performance, the dramatic and the emotional value, which I didn't get, became slightly better. There are very few scenes where the CGI was okay, but, in general, it's weak and cartoonish, and that's due to the bad green screen that is glaringly obvious.I liked the comprehensive concept of the evil as an antagonist, but what we got from it in the third act was disgraceful! I really suffered while watching this act with all its dull and illogical twists.I'm very disappointed! I haven't watched many movies that have been released this year, but this is definitely one of the worst.From now on I'll call this movie A Wrinkle in Logic!(4/10)",

            "content": "GRADE: C- THIS FILM IS NOT RECOMMENDED.IN BRIEF: A sci-fi fantasy that is metaphysical mumbo-jumbo and one of the year's most disappointing movies.JIM'S REVIEW: As a goofy teenager, Madeleine L'Engle's A Wrinkle in Time was heady stuff back in the sixties, a book that I found difficult to understand, let alone, enjoy. It was all metaphysical mumbo-jumbo in those late turbulent 60's and Ava DuVernay's updated film adaptation can be described the same way today. It is a film of good intentions gone badly.The film is ill-conceived from the start. (How anyone looking at the kitschy design couldd not have seen the many missteps is beyond me and the universe!) Words fail to accurately explain the many flaws, but try I must. But first, a short plot summary for those not familiar with the novel: Meg Murry, her brother, Charles Wallace, and a friend meet some time traveling matrons named Mrs. Which, Mrs. Whatsit, and Mrs. Who. (Who's on first?...I dunno!) They \"tesser\" to different worlds to find Meg's missing physicist father, who may have discovered the meaning of life, as they battle an evil force named The It (No, not that supernatural devious clown, although the circus of misfits has fully arrived).The director has diversity and woman's empowerment seemingly the major emphasis throughout this time-traveling saga, more blatantly on display than in most films. Score some points for that issue. But whereas, the recent Black Panther movie had the same idea and melded it successfully into its narrative, this heavy-handed version makes advancement for racial quotas in the most obvious of ways, primarily in its casting choices and stereotyping of some characters. Subtract points for the lack of logic and pure entertainment value. This film is a confusing dumbing-down of its source material.(In Ms. L'Engle's defense, many of her ideas of parallel dimensions, light vs. dark forces, black smoke monsters, and such were innovative and ground-breaking at the time, although now they are commonplace and contrived due to many later reincarnations from other sci-fi sources.) In fact, when the film stays earthbound, it oddly has more impact than its many treks to supernatural destinations.Storm Reid is our young heroine and the actress holds her own and creates a believable girl trying to cope with a new world order. Her casting is one of the few pleasures in this movie. Levi Miller has that teen idol look but is a bit bland as Meg's friend, Calvin, who seems to have a hair fetish through the movie. In smaller roles, Chris Pine and Gugu Mbatha-Raw register very well as the helpless and loving parents. Perhaps one of Ms. DuVernay's biggest hurdle was her miscasting of young Deric McCabe as Meg's gifted brother. He is just physically wrong for this role. As directed, the young actor overacts shamelessly and is annoyingly precocious. Mr. McCabe's resemblance to a small but mighty Herv\u00e9 Villechaize does not help matters either. (No rescue here, the plane never arrives!) When called on to be a menacing force of nature, his size and high-pitched line delivery has the completely opposite reaction, more bratty hissy-fit than life-threatening peril. This child actor may have talent, but this role does not show off that potential at all.Yet some of the other adult performers are just surprisingly awful, especially the three fairy godmother types played by Reese Witherspoon, Mindy Kaling, and the omnipotent Oprah \"You get a car\" Winfrey. It's hard to determine just who, whatsit, or especially \"why\" these actresses interpret their roles with a fuzzy cartoonish smugness and total lack of gravitas. They never create an iota of a believable character or transcend their real life personas. It's just dress-up time. Other unusual suspects are: Zach Galifianakis, once again hamming it up to excess as a yoga guru called The Happy Medium and Michael Pena plays Red briefly, a wise exit. Ms. DuVernay's vision becomes strained in this re-imagining and the technical CGI have a general artificial quality which subverts the story. It is a rarity in today's filmmaking that such a big budgeted blockbuster from the Disney Studio looks so cheap and be so bereft of imagination and visual style. Blame the artisans involved, the worst offender being costume designer Paco Delgado's outrageous drag queen outfits, the bejeweled make-up, and Disney's fairy-tale over-the-top hair design. (Perhaps this look would have worked as a more theatrical musical, A Wizard of Oz updated tale. As it stands, it just looks foolish and laughable.) In fact, evolving hair styles seems to be the deciding factor for character development, since it surely isn't the muddled screenplay by Jennifer Lee and Jeff Stockwell. It's more like a skeletal outline of a series of kiddie adventures as the characters space hop to different planets and different obstacles than a complex story of universal adult themes. The dialogue is just a series of positive pep talks and self-help platitudes that grow tiresome very fast (\"Be a warrior!\"...Celebrate your flaws!\"...\" Don't give up hope!\"...\"You know, you have great hair!\").A bombastic music score by Ramin Djawadi telegraphs the emotion one is suppose to feel but doesn't. Most of Naomi Sholan's production design and especially Elizabeth Keenan's unimaginative set decoration looks like a college art design project using painted styrofoam as its main element, with the prize going to best float. Only Tobias Schliesser's photography has some merit.Yes, there are a few effective scenes that are completely satisfying. After all, the director is a powerful force. Just see her previous two films, the superb Selma and the important documentary, 13, and it is proof of her talents. However, in this film, she loses control of her story with trite images (Orion's gaudy cavern, a bedazzled bigger-than-life Oprah, and those ugly costumes with added colored lip gloss, a dated 50's beach scene that seems out of place with all the other contemporary touches) mixed with strong ones (the ripple effect prior to transporting, an eerie beige Stepford suburbia, a dangerous race in a dark forest).This modern reboot of A Wrinkle in Time has many kinks to iron out. Sadly, it is a major disappointment. Hopefully, Ms. DuVerney and crew will learn from their failures and \"tesser\" onto other more worthwhile projects. This one deserves to be lost in its own parallel universe.",

You cannot convince me she was the best choice for the role, she was chosen for \"reasons\".Oprah is a fine human being, but her giant self 5 minutes into the film just looked dumb. That's the thing about this, everything about this film just rings as unnecessary and dumb.Zach G. Shows up for 2 minutes to collect a paycheck and have his name in the credits, along with 5-6 other actors who probably didn't read the whole script before agreeing to be in it.A total waste, do not bother with this.

Every payoff seemed unearned, every line of dialogue felt flat instead of inspiring or thought-provoking or whatever emotion they were trying to make me feel.As an example, Calvin at one point says to Meg something like \"you don't know how incredible you are, do you?\" Yet, there is no context for why he know this or feels this way. To this point, Meg hasn't really shown anything incredible and there is no back story for these two except that they barely know each other. This is the kind of disconnected dialogue you can expect from the entire movie. Monologues and speeches that are suppose to have gravity and inspire but feel out of place. Where did it all go wrong? Is this a poor script, poor editing, or poor directing?The only character I really enjoyed was Charles Wallace, a name you get to know quite well because they say his name about 500 times. He (Deric McCabe) really made the best of the dialogue he was given.This movie is harmless, but ultimately not satisfying.",

            "review_title": "Worst Film of 2018?",
            "content": "'A Wrinkle In Time' is the worst film of this year thus far, due to it's poorly written screenplay, terribly written screenplay and underwhelming acting. On paper, this film has a lot going for it. It has a good selection of talented cast members, it's a Disney film and it's (supposedly) a wonderful, adventurous tale. So it is a wonder to me that all of these things could have gone wrong. From the very beginning, the weak screenplay is evident and consequently undermines the actors. It's very difficult to have great acting when the screenplay in which they act off is terrible. Unfortunately this resulted in talented actors such as Reese Witherspoon, Mindy Kaling, Oprah Winfrey and Chris Pine being undermined. It also did not help the characters were underdeveloped and simply not interesting. The female trio (Witherspoon, Kaling and Winfrey) were quite quirky and interesting at points, but still remained to be underdeveloped. The leading child cast protagonists were not very exciting, however I can't be too harsh on the young ones. They'll learn one day to be more selective with their film choices. However, Levi Miller shined in this film and was a clear stand-out for me. For a film directed at a younger audience, the plot is extremely bewildering and far too complex. I'm not sure whether this is just a poor adaptation of a great book, or the source material is not that great either. The story comes across as uninteresting, predictable and clich\u00e9d. There may have been a few somewhat-intriguing scenes, but they were ultimately lost amongst the rest of the film. The only thing this film truly succeeded in was a colourful costume and makeup design that was visually stunning. The female trio (Witherspoon, Kaling and Winfrey) looked vibrant and beautiful, with imaginative costumes and striking makeup. At least the film was nice to look at. Overall, this wasted-potential of a film can easily go missed as it is poorly written and uninteresting, and was not saved by it's few interesting aspects.",

When people spoke of the book, it was in terms that did not fire my imagination. It seemed it was of the wish-fulfillment adventure fantasy that Andre Norton worked in, and I did not care for Norton's work.So when my cousin and I went to see this movie this morning, I could approach it without any preconceptions. No outrage that Michael Keaton has been cast as a Batman with chubby cheeks, no contempt for anyone who thinks elves' ears are that pointy, none of the million and one indignities we are subject to because our slightest whims are unheeded without the bother of our having to even think of them! They could change the story around entirely, and I wouldn't have the least idea. I would judge the movie on its own merits.I was mildly bored throughout by a universe in which the love of tween girls is the most powerful force in the universe; a universe where girls love their younger brothers who are smarter than they. I've been a smart younger brother. I can assure you, it is not an endearing quality.It was clear to me that this movie was made to cater to young girls, probably those who loved the books. Since I wasn't a young girl, never had been one, and probably never will be one, it wasn't intended for me. On the way out, I saw a young girl and an adult woman leaving and consulted with them. The younger thought it was good. The elder agreed with me when I used the word \"gooey\".",

            "content": "A Wrinkle in Time is one of those books that a lot of kids are aware of. I myself have heard about the book since the sixth grade, and from I understand, is a very popular read for a lot of girls. Before the new movie adaptation came out, I took the liberty of listening to an audiobook version. I can understand why as it focuses on a social outcast who gains a great deal of confidence through her journey within the universe. While I can't say that it's the masterpiece that a lot of people have said it is, it's still a good read for children and would even hope that classrooms use this a part of the English curriculum. I think what kids liked about the book was its use of science and mathematics in conjunction with the more fantasy elements of it. It plays out a bit like a smarter Disney story. It seems fitting that Disney would acquire the rights to make a film version of the story. While it has a lot of cerebral moments, I could see this in the vein of Dark Crystal or Labyrinth; one of those edgier family films from the 1980s. Lets see how this new A Wrinkle in Time does.Young Meg Murry (played by Storm Reid) is a brilliant, but depressed and aggressive middle schooler who is still trying to deal with that her father NASA scientist Dr. Alex Murry (played by Chris Pine) had gone missing four years earlier. She has only her younger brother and prodigy Charles Wallace (played by Deric McCabe) and mother Dr. Kate Murry (played by Gugu Mbatha-Raw). During an evening at home, their visited by the eccentric Mrs. Whatsit (played by Reese Witherspoon) who tells them that \"tesseracting\" is possible. This puts the family into a shock, but seem to leave it alone as a strange visit.The next day, Meg, Charles-Wallace, and fellow friend Calvin (played by Levi Miller) once again encounter Mrs. Whatsit, this time along with the quoting Mrs. Who (played by Mindy Kaling) and godlike Mrs. Which (played by Oprah Winfrey). The three women reveal that their father is on a distant planet somewhere in the universe and is up to these three kids to \"tesseract\" with them to find them. They end up visiting several worlds and strange people including the Happy Medium (played by Zach Galifinakis) and the evil Red (played by Michael Pe\u00f1a).This new version of A Wrinkle in Time tries to do a lot with it's short running time, but unfortunately makes me debate whether the book was that good to begin with. To begin with, this only follows the book loosely. It's the same plot of finding our character's father, but the encounters are different. That wouldn't matter if it helped the story, but many of the changes neither make sense or devalue what the book was better at. To be fair, A Wrinkle in Time could have not been easy to adapt. It's clear that director Ava DuVernay (Selma) wants to transport her audience to new worlds. And to be honest, the visuals and art direction look stunning. In fact, I might have liked this movie more if it would have taken it's time to show us these worlds, and let the atmosphere tell the story. She's trying to do this, but each scene seems to flow at a quick pace, almost like their fast-forwarding to the next sequence. They'll show Meg getting in trouble...next. The kids go to a colorful world...next. Kids go to the evil world...next. Having a lack of focus might have benefited A Wrinkle in Time. The story itself, aside from having major pacing issues, has such a convoluted execution, that it still feels dated. Without giving anything away, this is another movie where \"love\" is the answer. Think of it as a kid friendly version of Inception. While it's not that their trying to make it work, but perhaps this is something was simply better on paper. The acting even suffers. Oprah is playing herself, Reese Witherspoon is in need of direction, and the boy who plays Charles Wallace is really bad. I'm not sure if it's the writing or the actor, but this kid only seems to be emulating a smart alec rather then a true prodigy. The only ones who does exceptional work is Storm Reid as Meg and Chris Pine.I'll give this four copies of A Wrinkle in Time novels out of ten. Sad to say that despite having a Disney-like story, this has no idea what it wants to be. It gets a lot of points for some neat visuals and style, but the story, the most essential thing to a movie, has the distinction of feeling pandering and confused. Perhaps children will see something else, but this is one book I'm keeping closed.",

            "content": "There's no denying the importance that this movie may have for some audiences. The mere fact that this past weekend saw the first time 2 movies with 2 directors of color top the box office is astonishing and inspiring. It's long overdue, and should be lauded. On that note, A Wrinkle in Time is a film that ends up being of far more importance than it does a film that will please most. To say the least, it's a mess.I walked out of the theater trying to quantify what this film felt like, and I think to me, it's a Disney Channel Original Movie with the budget of your typical summer blockbuster. The budget of a little over 100 million is actually historic, for giving the first black woman a budget that high to direct a film. But that's not even necessarily the problem with the film. The problem lies with the screenplay and perhaps partially DuVernay's direction.I've never read the book, nor had the interest to, but I have to imagine there was an easier way to adapt this book than the result we got. The story revolves around Meg, who's father has gone missing for years, as she tries to travel through time and space with a few strange beings, her brother, and a new friend from school. Perhaps some audiences, mostly on the younger side, will connect to the story of reconnection and family, but the execution is mind-bogglingly silly.There are particular story choices in the 3rd act that are laughably out of place, and even a few blatant mistakes in directing that I never truly could grasp how they got past the editing room. If this were to have come out when I was younger, perhaps it's something I could connect with. But a well-performed and semi-visually impressive film isn't enough to surpass all of the frustrating mistakes in the script and direction.4.0/10",

            "content": "Another weekend, another literary classic to be remade by the lovely folks in La La Land. The movie world continues to scrape deep for the next big fad, Disney brings A Wrinkle in Time to life, ready to unleash magic into the world. With super star Oprah Winfrey backing the project and a number of stars to further support the film, and potentially bring in the big bucks. Does it succeed, or should you just read the book? Robbie K here to provide some insight into the movies ad guide your experience. Let's get started!LIKES:The Acting: With a star-studded cast, one hopes for brilliant performances and Wrinkle in Time has some impressive displays of the theater arts. Storm Reid's career has started off well in this movie, a nice blend of passion fighting pessimism in a manner that feels very much like the whiney preteen age. Her fellow child actors are impressive, but the adult casts' experience manages to shine forth. Oprah's words re limited, but her regality comes across well in her performance. Mindy Kaling's lines are a little more dynamic, again executed to be entertaining, and while wise, not the most engaging of characters. It's actually Reese Witherspoon who was my favorite, bringing the most spunk, comedy, and character to the movie. Her chemistry with the cast was fantastic and her abilities certainly charmed much of the movie. The Morals: Like the book, the movie has a fantastic repertoire of lessons to teach the young audience members targeted by the film. A Wrinkle in Time greatly praises the concept of hope, imbedding the driving, divine light of inspiring others to better themselves and motivate them to fight. It's focus on utilizing the positive to combat the negative emotions is something this world could easily learn from, and even more so in the ability to accept one's faults and praise one's strengths. While a bit preachy in the dialog, the movie has those emotional moments to absolutely sell those life lessons and perhaps promote the next great person for them to endorse. Still, use this movie as a means to educate those in the way of values of self-worth. The Visuals: What can I say, the best part of this movie is the fantastic world building is the world building this movie brought to the silver screen. A Wrinkle in Time's selling point is how beautiful the art department made all their characters and settings. While the realistic Earth scenes are a cavalcade of traditional settings, the real majesty comes when our heroes begin to bend reality. First the costumes of the misses are incredible, as their personalities erupt to life on each planet they visit. Makeup and costume blend together perfectly, truly bringing out the beauty of each entity and reflecting their personal view of each world. And once the costumes are recognized, the creation of the dimensional galaxy gets even better. My favorite planet is the Flower planet (as advertised on the trailers) as it blended all the color and visual stunning goodness into one area. However, there are plenty of other things hidden in behind the trailers to be impressed with. \nDISLIKES:The Story: It starts off so strong, but soon the plot takes a major hit in quality because of how rushed it feels. Once the traveling begins, the movie's plot hits a major break and takes a mighty plunged into rushed territory. Character development, major plot hits, even the mighty antagonist were all kind of bland in this movie, never reaching the full steam past girl power junction. Why such a literature classic could not build up steam I don't know, but sadly this movie didn't quite have all it took to be exciting. A bit annoying: The movie has plenty of cute, kid friendly gimmicks, but my word does it crush over into some rather annoying things. The most annoying for me was how often they repeat the name Charles Wallace, a not only obnoxious name, but an obnoxious calling that was used every five seconds. As picky as this sounds, I quickly got annoyed at how lackluster the name was and how it was used unnecessarily in every context. Better luck next time in dialog adaptation guys, perhaps next time you'll learn how to substitute a name with better descriptions. The Simplistic Journey: You might be thinking Disney would pour their hearts into making an interdimensional journey with some style, class and flare their studios can brings. Sadly, the movie itself still seems to fail in this department for me. Three worlds make up the entire leg of the journey and while they each have some magic of their own it didn't feel like quite a detective journey. So many worlds were reduced to a blurry montage that lasted less than a minute depriving me of a scavenger hunt in order to fit into the two-hour runtime package. With their studio they could have much better on this aspect to extend the mystery, perhaps adding their own leeway and integration of cosmic powers to uncover the clues to finding dear old dad. Nope, again the movie is just a sad, sad display of tempting visuals and rushed plot. The Anticlimactic End: Again, there is buildup up to how deadly the darkness is and how it will be hunting for our heroes at every turn. So maybe you might hope that the big, bad, black void had some actual tricks up its sleeve to hinder the young warriors' journey. Again, the movie has little exciting climax to act as an impasse, a few emotional shadows and musical sores to try to illicit a response. However, there is little threat behind the darkness void, which symbolic as it can be is a boring end to what was supposed to be a crossing of the universe. Sorry, but I expect my shadows to have a little more bite and might when they threaten to plague the universe. The result is a cute, but rather dull finale to one of the most epic tales of the literature adapted world. The VERDICT: Wrinkle in Time feels like a child's version of Annihilation, but without the unique and twists the genre could really have used. It certainly isn't awful as some may say, with good acting and world building to bring forth an emotional telling of valuable ethics and morals. Yet, the movie does not meet the expectations placed by the book, for the story has been watered down into a hokey, gimmick filled manhunt that failed to reach its full potential. Perhaps the director's cut will go into more details with the abandoned worlds, but I doubt extra time will be able to bring the full might this movie needed to match the literary work. Not the worst movie to grace the theater, but outside of visuals and some acting, I think this one can be held until home viewing. My scores are: Adventure/Family/Fantasy: 7.0\nMovie Overall: 5.5",

            "content": "It is strange to see a huge budget family movie like this fail to achieve any of its own goals on such an epic scale. Saying that A Wrinkle in Time lacks compelling interest would be an understatement. It is a cosmically underwhelming film peppered with expensive yet empty visuals. In fact, it is often straight up boring as it moves through several scenes of superfluous waxing philosophic about the nature of time, love, and good vs evil. These little narrations use up movie time and replace any real development of story and character. Ultimately it makes for a rather tedious film to sit through.\nActors... hmm. The big surprise for me was that Oprah struck me as the weakest in this department. It didn't help that her boring delivery and rather emotionless expressions are contrasted by these stagey costumes, hair, and makeup that would be well suited for a 1970s disco star. But this brings up a problem with all the witches: they don't look like witches, they look like actors in absurd costumes. If I lived next door to these people and they showed up at my house, I wouldn't be concerned in the least, because it would be so overtly obvious that my supposedly \"strange\" neighbors were really just theater people who pretend their real lives are their stage characters. Too fake. As for everyone else, they were relatively ok I guess, when considering what they had to work with.\nAside from needing a totally different script, I think the core problem here is that the film never felt mysterious or surprising. The visuals never felt like anything beyond generically \"creative.\" Nothing was convincingly weird as it traverses between these supposedly cosmic characters and other dimensions, which ultimately made it exactly the opposite of what a story like this should be, and so it ends up as a predictable film on all fronts.",

Sometimes I really wish directors would let me see their movies before they released them so that I could point out some of the mistakes that could be quickly fixed.\nDeric McCabe as Charles Wallace is super cute, but sometimes it was hard to understand what he was saying.\nI couldn't understand a word Storm Reid was saying during the tornado scene in the woods.\nCliched scene where someone says, \"Do you trust me?\"\nMindy Kaling looked so awkward trying to run in her ridiculous dress. What was her character's purpose? She didn't actually do anything to help. \nOver-the-top make-up. The costumes were creative, but they looked like costumes.The \"Mrs's\" looked more fake than magical. \nYou don't need to pay extra money to see this in IMAX. It's fine on the regular screen. Better yet, watch it when it comes out on Netflix.\nThe dialogue may sound good in the book, but it's awkward in the movie.\nLots of close-ups that don't really work.\nA scene in the second trailer was completely cut out of the movie.\nI actually looked at the clock on my cell phone. That's never a good sign.\nThere's no real villain. There's only a wispy, menacing \"it.\" \nKids who haven't read the book might think that Oprah's character's name is Mrs. Witch.

I heard her speak to a room full of 10,000 a number of years ago at the California Governor's Conference for Women and she was mesmerizing.\nSurprisingly, some of the acting was not good by quite a few of the other actors too.

            "content": "Ava DuVernay is best known for her directing of \"Selma\", an excellent film about the civil rights struggle in Jim Crow-era Alabama. With AWIT, DuVernay appears to have tried to continue her personal civil rights march by way of creating a children's film that is chock-full of good messages for young girls, especially minority young girls.That's an honorable intention, but it's unfortunate that she decided to advance her agenda using the name of a well-known, well-loved children's book. Because that's what this is: DuVernay changed Madeleine L'Engle's story in severe ways to promote her own message instead of Ms. L'Engle's. DuVernay made the focal point of the story a young black girl's life struggles, which was not the point of the original novel. That would be fine if she had created something new and original, but a lot of people who grew up loving the original book were rightly disappointed or offended by the changed focus. The film also has a misanthropist (anti-male) slant that was off-putting to my family; none of the male characters are remotely competent, and nearly all of them betray the main character at some point (Murray disappears for four years, Calvin eats the beach food, Charles Wallace becomes the bad guy) or are simply evil in their own right (the It is... itself, Michael Pena kidnaps Charles Wallace, Calvin's dad is verbally abusive to him). Even male characters who are minor players are portrayed as helpless or ineffective (Zach Galifianakis's clueless guru, Principal Jenkins). The movie's heroes are all women, period, and that cannot be by accident. Just as telling is towards the end of the film when Ms. Who is naming off legendary heroes, all except one were non-white. Again, this cannot be by accident, and is just as wrong as it would have been if all the heroes she had named were white.There are plenty of other posts about the poor acting, awful pacing, lousy direction, and overuse of facial close-up shots (DuVernay uses close-ups with the same proliferation that J.J. Abrams uses lens flare), so I won't go into those here. Suffice it to say, this movie is AWIT in name only",

            "content": "Mucking around with cinematic adaptations of the precious prose from audiences' childhoods is somewhat of a minefield - for every Lord of the Rings triumph, there's an insulting travesty such as ... well... The Hobbit. Tragically, there's much more than a whiff of the latter in Disney's big-budget shot at breathing life into author Madeleine L'Engle's metaphysical whimsy. Ava DuVernay's A Wrinkle in Time is a bloated but sweet movie you desperately want to like, gosh darn it. Sadly, it's too unsalvageable to even defend as harmless children's entertainment - so cataclysmically off-base that, rather than rescue it from Camazotz, you'd probably go out of your way to maroon it there, and save everyone from the heartbreak of its existence. L'Engle's novel had a gentle otherworldliness in its whimsy, but the only thing 'otherworldly' in Jennifer Lee and Jeff Stockwell's screenplay is that it reads like an extraterrestrial inhabitant clumsily trying to piece together how humans verbally communicate. The film drips with more grotesquely stale exposition than dialogue, with the unappetizing side order of characters reacting to the increasingly fantastic happenstances as if shot with tranquilizer darts, dopily shuffling from point to point without ever seemingly registering an emotional response. Fall into an immediate conversation about feelings with a boy you've never met? Already outlandish for a teenager. Travel across the universe with a passive-aggressive space-witch who eventually takes the form of a flying cabbage? Oh. Sure. Come face-to-face with the root of all unhappiness and evil in all multiverses? Meh. It almost defies belief that the director of the flooring, poignant Selma is capable of producing a film so shallow and emotionally stilted. It would normally play as charming to have a children's film bounce with the same episodic stream-of-consciousness of a child's storytelling, but DuVernay is never fully able to corral the playful lilt of L'Engle's gossamer, episodic plot. Instead, the film lurches from blandly dazzling planet to confusedly extraneous supporting character with nauseating, plodding incoherence. Loopy yogi Zach Galifianakis and charmingly threatening Michael Pe\u00f1a do their best to raise laughs with their awkwardly out-of-place cameos, but even they fail to distract from how flat the razzle-dazzle of each new alien landscape in between feels. The film's expensive-but-unsophisticated visual effects, are, at best, benignly underwhelming (and what little wonder is raised by their colourful panoramas is immediately extinguished by the unwanted musical accompaniment of an asinine pop remix). Similarly, the ludicrously kitschy costumes do nothing to dispel the aesthetic of tackiness (poor Oprah looks like she should be engaged in a ray gun battle with Ming the Merciless from Flash Gordon). If this is what $100 million looks like, it's not money well spent. Things do pick up favourably upon our heroes' arrival at the forebodingly conformist alien hell-hole Camazotz. DuVernay excels at conjuring inventively creepy set pieces, some pushing the boundaries of what otherwise plays as a distinctly young children's film (perhaps a horror movie should be next on her docket?), and, briefly, the film is infused with the glimmer of actual stakes and emotional resonance. Naturally, it doesn't last long, losing steam with a stuttering dud of an ending, which takes all of the nonchalance of the (non)climax of L'Engle's novel, and drenches it with an uncomfortable excess of shouted sentiment (and if you thought the ending metaphysics of Interstellar were uncomfortable... hoo boy; just you wait), just in case the cloying moral hadn't quite sunk in yet. We almost relish the prospect of the children being tormented again as alternative. DuVernay attempts her own 'Wrinkle in Time' by fusing contemporary setting and sensibilities with the antiquated language and uncynical sentimentality of L'Engle's novel. Her intent, evidently, is to show how much our jaded, modern world could benefit from an infusion of more old-fashioned whimsy - which is pretty hard to argue with. Unfortunately, the pairing of quaintness and contemporary is a perennially dubious fit, the twain influences serving to best illustrate each other's worst qualities rather than complimenting each other (Charles Wallace delivering a chirpy, James Stewart-esq monologue attesting to Meg's inner greatness in the face of her post-feminist schoolyard bullies is one of the most cringeworthy movie moments of the past several years - but don't worry: it'll have plenty of company by the time the credits roll here). You can practically taste how driven DuVernay is to make A Wrinkle in Time a children's film with a strong pedagogical moral barometer, including commentary on abusive parents and eating disorders, but, sadly, her film is too much of a disjointed muddle for any real impactful content to stand out. Instead of elevated and inspired, audiences are, sadly, likely to emerge as far more cynical and hopeless than before. Even the film's impressive cast fail to elevate the overcooked, sinking ship of a film around them. Storm Reid feels like a fully authentic teenager (and is lackadaisically likeable in spite of that), but she's a tad too flat to sell her volcanic emotionality as a commanding presence - in short, more 'Meh' than 'Meg.' Chris Pine and Gugu Mbatha-Raw easily steal the show, imbuing the film with its only dregs of emotion and charisma as her earnest scientist parents, but they're both too disappointingly underused to contribute all that much. As the trio of 'magical Mrs.,' Oprah, Reese Witherspoon, and Mindy Kaling, all feel simply uncomfortable, alternating unfunny banter with mawkish overacting and banal pep talks. Levi Miller is the dictionary definition of 'bland YA lead' as Meg's clumsily spontaneous love interest, while Deric McCabe is impressively adept at playing 'creepy child,' but is infuriatingly simpering as Meg's child genius brother. Time is a precious commodity in today's day and age. Unfortunately, Disney's latest doesn't so much Wrinkle as waste yours. Pundits may complain that 'they 'may not make 'em like they used to' - but, what we learn from A Wrinkle in Time is that, disappointingly, sometimes it's best not to try.  -4.5/10",

Here it's just straightforward good vs. evil.As to issue of depicting a biracial Meg, people have noted that representation matters (especially since it was merely assumed that Meg was white in the book). Some idiot on a cable news channel complained that Ava DuVernay cares more about political correctness than about making money for Disney (Earth to said idiot: the 1980s called and they want their mentality back).Basically, it's not any kind of great movie.

            "content": "A Wrinkle in Time is one of those books, that just makes an impact.This, whatever this was, wasn't what I read so long ago. It was not even CLOSE. The characters were changed beyond all recognition. For one thing, Charles Wallace is a genius who doesn't speak to people outside of his family. And the story, well I did not find one plot point or section of dialogue that was even related to A Wrinkle in Time. They focus this story more on Meg, she is not really the central focus.Moreover, A Wrinkle in Time is one of those books that elevates you. This had the reverse effect, it depressed me.I'm going to try to find the 2003 Made-for-TV version with Chris Potter, I have heard that, that version follows the book almost exactly. Is anyone with me? I found it and have started watching it, although it is cheaply made, it is made well and it tells the story a lot better than this.Even Peter Jackson's Lord of the Rings and Hobbit kept true to a lot of Tolkien's ideas, and they mined the blazes out of the 'Appendices\" of that book, and also many of the companion books that had been written, including the official artwork and some of the music, from The Road goes Ever On, they used Tolkein's lyrics from that.But this? They went far away from what it was supposed to be. And if i recall correctly, Ms Who was not a human figure, she was some entity.I hope whoever wrote this travesty gets whatever they deserve.There was a genuine opportunity here to make this into something wonderful, and Disney just missed the point completely, tried to cater to children, and even lost THAT Audience. The 3 Star Wars Prequel films are more intelligent than this is, and that's making a huge statement. That's how bad this film is. This film should be excised from theatres immediately.And people who know my reviews, know that if even I despise something, then it is not worth seeing, because I usually love everything I see: It's hard to disappoint me. I always find something good in every film I review, this film has very few positive aspects. Mostly because they took the work and so substantively changed it, that it cannot be recognized.",

It follows the story of Meg Murry, her brother Charles Wallace and their friend Calvin who are on a journey with the aid of three mysterious ladies in order to find Meg's scientist father, who had disappeared for reasons unknown.I went into this movie with an open mind, as I haven't read the classic book before. I will admit that the people behind it tried, even if it was a mediocre effort. I found Meg's internal struggle where she has to deal with her father's disappearance during the first act very believable and even relatable. She deals with a loss of motivation, she shows negative emotion easily and even feels embarrassed by being herself. What makes this struggle feel relatable is that parallels can be drawn from it and having to deal with the loss of a loved one.I also thought the movie mostly looked great on an aesthetic level. I thought that it mostly utilized its use of CGI and effects well. These effects mostly gave the impression that we were being immersed in a beautiful world. On the other hand, the CGI and green-screening sometimes become too noticeable. That's incredibly bothersome since this is a big budgeted movie with an occasional cheap look to it.Aside from Meg, I wasn't fond of any of the other characters at all. The mysterious ladies were all decently acted, but I couldn't remember a thing about them because they were virtually devoid of any character. The other two kids just feel like one-note tropes. Charles Wallace is the smart-alecky genius of the group while Calvin is just the awkward kid who befriends Meg and barely offers anything to the story. I do remember him offering something minor to it, but nothing of any real importance. The only child actor who I thought was mostly putting in effort into their role was Storm Reid. McCabe on the other hand felt wooden throughout the entire film, but I can't blame him since his character was absolutely bland and obnoxious.Finally, as for the plot, it is mostly a bare-bone and linear plot. It is almost entirely about the journey to find Meg's father with some pieces thrown in. The first act was pretty good, where it explores Meg's internal conflict, but it gradually goes downhill as Meg and co. leave. My biggest storytelling issue has to be with the resolution. The way everything comes together makes absolutely no sense. I was just left confused as I sat in the theater thinking \"What just happened? I'm completely lost.\" I thought the resolution was horrible. I mean nothing traumatically horrible happens to the characters, but the execution of it was just all over the place.A Wrinkled in Time is simply a mess. There are good elements to this movie, there really are. The problem with them is that they're overshadowed by mediocre to terrible elements. Children will most likely enjoy the movie, but it's debatable on whether or not older folks would.4/10",

It's something about space traveling with use of the 5th dimension where one moves through the universe by using just his mind. Mr. And Mrs. Murry (Chris Pine and Gugu Mbatha-Raw), two scientists, worked on this for years and are convinced it's possible. Until one day Mr. Murry actually disappears without a trace and leaves his family behind.And before they know it, three eccentric-looking, fairy-like women show up. They are called Mrs. Which (Oprah Winfrey), Mrs. Whatsit (Reese Witherspoon) and Mrs. Who (Mindy Kaling). The three are a sort of space police who heard a cry for help and moved quickly through the universe to the spot where Meg (Storm Reid), daughter of Mr. and Mrs. Murry, lives. And together with her brother Charles Wallace (Deric McCabe) and Calvin (Levi \"Better watch out\" Miller), Mr. Popularity at school, they're off on a rescue mission.This rescue mission leads them from one obscure and bizarre place to the other. From the colorful planet Uriel, where Mrs. Whatsit turns into a fluttering carpet with a face that looks like a gigantic sprout after she has conversed with a whole bunch of flying flowers. And they talk in color. For real? Yes really. Next, they arrive in a gloomy, dark world covered with clouds, with strangely stacked rock formations. Worlds with immensely sheepish creatures on stilts. And a spreading black smoke called Camazotz. Apparently, this cloud represents evil. And it's spreading rapidly in space. And all this can be seen in the company of a huge, giant Oprah Winfrey. Whether this has been done intentionally to justify her body weight or it's described like that in a book by Madeleine L'Engle, where this film is based on, I really don't know. But it looked absurd anyway.\"A wrinkle in time\" is a fantasy movie, with a gang of children on an adventure in deep space. It reminded me sometimes of Wonka's chocolate factory where every room was a new surprise as well. Only this film is not the same as its other Disney predecessors. Even though every Disney production is clearly aimed at a younger audience, there was always a bit of magic that appealed to adults as well. To be honest: I always have and still can enjoy a Disney movie. Well, this is the first film of them where I can't agree with that fact. I was really annoyed at certain moments. The cacophony of colors and the absurdity of places where they traveled to, felt really exaggerated. The moralistic messages are a bit exorbitant and theatrical. Sometimes it was a bit too obvious. Or did the makers feel the need to give the youth of today an educational kick in the pants to draw their attention to those certain values in life again? A lesson about good and evil. And furthermore, being different doesn't mean that you are an outsider and that it's not normal to be scorned by others.No, this Disney film wasn't my cup of tea. I even thought it was just plain boring. Despite the fact the cast is filled with some famous stars, the acting itself was sometimes even laughable. Even a bonding with the characters was missing. So I really didn't care in the end whether they would be catapulted through the universe or not. The only one of the three cosmic goddesses who could charm me was Reese Witherspoon. And that because of her brutal attitude and a big mouth. Maybe fans of the book will be excited while watching this film. If, however, it was the intention to proclaim the message about goodness and equality, it might have been better if they didn't make a spectacle out of it.",

I am not a youth ages 10-14.A WRINKLE IN TIME follows the story of Meg, a young girl who's father has gone missing. With the help of mysterious figures Mrs. Which, Mrs. Whatsit and Mrs. Who, Meg goes in searching for her father - through space and time - and ends up helping to save the universe in the process.As Directed by DuVernay (SELMA), this WRINKLE is fantastical in all ways, starting with the visuals I don't know how much was spent on this film, but all of it is on the screen as the images - and imagery - are fascinating to look at, the costumes are unique (to say the least) and the story is simple enough for even a young person to follow.And that might be enough to hold the attention of a 10-14 youth - it wasn't enough for me.If you start to really follow the plot (what there was of it) and the intentions in the scenes, items start to not add up at all. While I understood Meg's motivations - to find her Dad - well enough, NONE of the other character's motivations - and intentions - were clear, or made sense. At one point, a character turns from good to bad (or was it vica-versa) and it just didn't make any sense.I think a lot of this issue was the 3 big stars that were cast as the benevolent overseers for Meg's journey. Reese Witherspoon, Mindy Kahling and, yes, Oprah Winfrey as Mrs. Whatsit, Mrs. Who and Mrs. Which (respectively). Their role in this adventure (I guess) is to guide and help Meg on her adventure, so they were supposed to be loving, caring and gentle with just a hint of secretness (so, I guess that Meg can figure things out for herself - kind of like Glinda the Good Witch in the Wizard of Oz). But, instead, they come off as smug, annoying know-it-alls who are purposely keeping key information from this young girl - if I was around, I would have called the police on them. Also...they all seemed to be acting in their own movies, so their styles just didn't mesh, as well as the acting styles of other \"stars\" like Michael Pena and (especially) Zach Galifinakas - I don't know what they heck he was doing, but Director DuVernay did a poor job of reigning him in or helping him to create any kind of semblance of character.A fantastical feature with eye-popping visuals and, I'm afraid, poorly written, acted and directed. This might be enough for an enjoyable afternoon in the theater for the target audience.It wasn't for me - and, I think, my front runner for WORST FILM OF 2018.Letter Grade C (for the visuals and the always appealing performance of Chris Pine, who - I have to admit - I have a man crush on).4 (out of 10) stars and you can take that to the Bank (OfMarquis)",

The story never quite achieves its obvious goal (which I won't spoil here but will become apparent soon into the film).

Was this made for 5-year olds and someone forgot to mention that to the adult paying audience?As such, it's neither a terrible film-- nor a good one. It's too frightening for younger children and too ludicrous for older ones. They just pretty much miss the mark in every way, relying too heavily on big-name stars and not nearly enough on good story, script, and film-making. While it might serve as an after-school special, it doesn't really qualify as big-screen fare. It is obvious from the ratings that this movie leaves the average viewer disappointed and unimpressed.",

            "content": "A wrinkle in time is what you get when you take really dense source material with multiple themes both grounded and philosophical and strip it down to its bare bones. A simple story that's almost completely incomprehensible. The basic story is that of a heroine, a thirteen year old girl named Meg (played by Storm Reid) who needs to be reunited with her father and wants to be accepted for who she is. She's accompanied along the way by her little brother and a cute boy from school, neither of whom are main protagonists in the movie.That sounds simple enough right..? It's not. The movie's a mess because the main plot and theme are weighed down by elements (strange characters, strange worlds, heavy themes) that are poorly established or completely ignored, leaving the viewer having to work hard to sift through all the nonsensical mumbo jumbo to follow along. What's happening? Who are these ladies? What are these worlds? What does it all mean? These are things that should have be established early in the movie but weren't. There's a reason that movies like Guardians of the Galaxy, The Matrix, Wonder Woman, have a lot of exposition and world building early on. A scene set in the past... a character who just vomits exposition... a prologue scene... all to set the stage. To avoid confusing the audience further afield. That's really the main reason the movie just doesn't work. There are some others, but they aren't as serious as the movies scripting issues.Storm Reid was solid as Meg, and the two other child actors Levi Miller (as Calvin the teenage would be love interest) and Deric McCabe (as Charles Wallace the younger brother) were both okay. Miller was given little to do. McCabe should have been given a larger role in the movie to make the third act actually compelling. I suspect that if the people behind casting the movie had gotten a better actor for the role instead of casting for ethnicity, the character would have played a much larger role in the film. The movie really needed it.The one thing, the only thing this movie did well was deliver on its message of empowering young kids, especially girls, and more to the point young girls of color. The aim that was no doubt spearheaded by Director Ava Duvernay and Screenwriter Jennifer Lee: accept yourself for who you are and don't let other people define who you are. That's basically the gist of this movie, and that's a great message to send to kids. Too bad the execution from the aforementioned was otherwise horrendous.A few other likes: Chris Pine and Gugu Mbatha-Raw as the parents. They both did really well with the screen-time given. They were likable, believable, and empathetic. There was also a terrific visual sequence early in the film that was really cool looking, like something out of The Wizard of Oz. loved it. And I also enjoyed a certain key character moment given to Storm Reid's Meg that ties into what I said about the filmmakers message. But as far as likes go, that's it.I would only recommend A Wrinkle in Time if you have a daughter(s) or are a young girl/teen. The message is one worth seeing for them, even if the movie sucks. For everyone else: PASS.",

This emotionally riveting fantasy is rich in cinematic photography reminiscent of the multi-million dollar blockbuster Avatar (2009) and the creative spectacle of The Imaginarium of Doctor Parnassus (2009). At the same time, this movie incorporates the powerful and uneasy confrontation with betrayal and evil with its parallelism to the fascinating fantasy world of The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe (2005) and the darker horror classic The Omen (1976). But more poignant comparisons might be the quantum transpersonal love of Interstellar (2014) and The Neverending Story (1984) based on an international best seller novel by German writer Michael Ende that addresses a fat boy who is bullied and finds himself transported into fantasy world to face \"the nothingness.\"This amazing movie besides tapping into the female power of Oprah Winfrey, Reese Witherspoon, and Mindy Kaling, a young female starlet, Storm Reid, as Meg gets to be front and center in coping with school bullying and the grief of the sudden and unexplained disappearance four years ago of her scientist father played by Chris Pine. A sometimes difficult movie to experience because of its sharp inclusion of the insidious power of evil, the uneasy transformation from a light hearted fantasy into the clutches of an ominous, unbalancing sense of dread, A Wrinkle in Time presents its important belief in family and love in a time of societal turmoil when good and evil seems to be present in America today. Perhaps this movie touches too close to home for some, but nevertheless, this movie can offer up a vital and essential experience and message to address today's conflicted populace with hope and vision of a possible tomorrow.",

I suspect that many of the reviews calling the film \"utter trash\" are very much politically-motivated.That being said, another sad truth of the matter is this: \"A Wrinkle In Time\" is not a very good film, either. It is pretty bland all the way through and often seems a bit too preachy or heavy-handed than what it needed to be. Hence, a \"right down the middle\" 5/10 ranking seems in order, which is exactly what I gave it.For a basic plot summary, \"Wrinkle\" follows the journey of Meg (Storm Reid), Calvin (Levi Miller), & Charles Wallace (Deric McCabe) on their intergalactic question to find Dr. Murray (Chris Pine), the scientist father of Meg & Charles who disappeared one night and hasn't been seen in three years since. The travels of the trio are helped along by the enigmatic \"Mrs.\", those being Mrs. Which (Oprah Winfrey), Mrs. Whatsit (Reese Witherspoon), and Mrs. Who (Mindy Kaling).Generally speaking, I thought that this film hemmed close enough (at least for me) to Madeline L'Engle's original novel. Besides some of the material on Camazotz being changed, it seemed like a pretty good match. The big problem here, though, is that \"Wrinkle\" seems far more intent on pushing the message of positivity and linking it to current social/political events than it does actually fostering a really interesting screenplay or story.Now, don't get me wrong: I like the positive message of the film, and in all honesty I think it will play a lot better to youngsters than it will to my 32-year old self (this is an adaptation of a YA novel, after all). But I just think it throws the baby out with the bathwater to a certain extent in the way it seems to gloss over certain story points in order to cement its overall message.What this creates a film that is filled with diverse characters, positive messages, and uplifting themes...but is so bland to watch for anyone with any film sophistication whatsoever that it doesn't succeed on any artistic level. Besides Witherspoon acting her heart out (as per the usual), the acting choices seem a bit odd and stunted. Nothing to ever aid in the emotional investment needed to truly care about these characters.The bottom line for me, I guess, is that I felt this adaption of \"Wrinkle in Time\" stressed its message over its ability to really craft a great piece of cinema, and I would argue that the latter is always more important than the former (no matter how great the message is). In the business of cinema, a film won't have the desired effect (no matter how much the filmmakers wish it) if it it messily constructed, and \"Wrinkle In Time\" most certainly is that.So, I'm grading this one right down the middle. Just good enough to appeal to kids or very inexperienced theater-goers, but not nearly good enough for anyone else.",

The essence of the film is the CGI effects, the blazing colors, the over-the-top characters, the disconnected episodes of the continuity. (Just hunting for a missing father isn't enough.} Storm Reid is wonderful as Meg. She has had quite a bit of experience, so she was ready for the job. Just the right amount of cynicism and wonder to lead her down the right path. Levi Miller as Calvin (a wonderful actor most recently remembered from the title role in PAN, the Hugh Jackman starrer) made the most out of a poorly drawn role. His function had much more importance than the writer gave it, and he brought as much to it as he could. Deric McCabe lurched between the endearing and off-putting sequences of his role as Charles Wallace. McCabe is a lightly experienced actor who shows signs of a promising career. Charles Wallace was a bit more than he could handle gracefully; his transitions were too abrupt. The surrealistic characters are a bit much. On the printed page, they allow for individual interpretation - embellishment if you will. On screen, they are immediately locked in. Oprah Winfrey can be a wonderful actress (The Color Purple, The Butler). Here, she is not. Mrs Which - a name that unfortunately - when spoken - can only conjure up something else - should be an over-abiding presence. The character should not scream Oprah Winfrey, and this portrayal did. (I don't know how it could have been avoided; she is too well-known.) Several other African-American actresses would have served much more effectively. Reese Witherspoon, as Mrs Whatsit, found a way to do her flighty impersonation. It was empathetic; it should have been endearing. Only Mindy Kaling, as Mrs Who - usually at her very least, annoying - was surprisingly comforting and accessible, not once straying into the obnoxious qualities of her TV persona. The prerequisite parent characters: Gugu Mbatha-Raw (given a totally impermeable character which she couldn't/didn't improve on) and Chris Pine, little seen and totally underused (actually wasted). There is a lot of trite dialogue, some handled well, other lines horribly obvious and awkward.

            "content": "Everyone seems to be throwing shade on Disney for being too attached to franchises and not doing anything original. They are definitely a studio that recycles ideas and makes them into unique new things, so they are always worthy of applause, no matter how familiar one of their films may seem. I was very much looking forward to A Wrinkle in Time. I had no prior knowledge of its source material, so I was seeing it as an original film that was hitting theatres sometime soon. That time has now come, and although I'm something who tries to see the best in every film that I watch, there's no denying that this one just doesn't quite feel right. Not to say this is a bad movie by any means, but here's why it fails to reach its potential on multiple occasions. After her father disappears and ends up somewhere distant in the universe, his daughter Meg is sent by three women on a quest through time and space to locate him. Accompanied by her younger brother Charles Wallace and newfound friend Clavin, the three of them embark on a strange journey across the universe. With unique visuals surround each and every scene and a fantastic performance by Storm Reid in the leading role, the epic scale, and emotional impact are truly what will win over the viewers. Aside from those elements, this is a fairly sloppy movie that tries a little too hard to be unique. Without ruining the film, it relies very heavily on the character of Charles Wallace to heighten certain aspects of the story. For that reason, the film suffers from a few laughable lines of dialogue, due to the fact that Deric McCabe may not have been the right kid to cast in this particular role. I was taken out of many dramatic moments, simply because I just wasn't buying into the way he was delivering his lines. On top of that, the three goddesses in Mindy Kaling, Reese Witherspoon, and Oprah Winfrey are present for a purpose, but they could've easily been excluded from the film once they bring the main characters to the places they need to be. They're quite annoying and simply unnecessary when it came to the story itself. Witherspoon was solid, but that's only because she had more things to do with her role than the others. The most frustrating part about this film is that Chris Pine is great in this movie and the conclusion of the third act felt earned and I found myself emotionally invested and caring about certain characters. The reason that aspect of the film is frustrating is that the film deviates too much from his character and it just feels like it drags quite a while before reaching him. That's a huge problem, especially when reflecting on the fact that the runtime is a mere 109 minutes. In the end, A Wrinkle in Time may have been a much better film with a few re-writes and about 20-30 minutes added on in order to expand the world a little more. The editing felt choppy at times, certain characters appear in places without explanation, and the solid visuals aren't enough to elevate the sloppy plot execution. Yes, there are a few great performances and the core story is worth watching, but there are too many problems surrounding that element to really send anyone out to see this in theatres. This is a neat and complex idea that would've worked as a much grander and elongated epic.

            "content": "Meg Murray (Storm Reid) and her little brother Charles Wallace (Deric McCabe) embark on a cosmic journey to find their missing father (Chris Pine). Joined by Meg's classmate Calvin O'Keefe (Levi Miller) and guided by the three mysterious astral travelers known as Mrs. Whatsit (Reese Witherspoon), Mrs. Who (Mindy Kaling) and Mrs. Which (Oprah Winfrey), the children brave a dangerous journey to a planet that possesses all of the evil in the universe.Our take: It's pretty enough to see in theaters.\nPost credit scene? No.While Wrinkle has its flaws and it may miss a few marks, it is ultimately an enjoyable 109 minutes. Director Ava DuVernay takes the viewers on a journey and if they allow themselves to suspend their disbelief and remember what it is like to be a child, it's an undeniably gratifying, beautiful, and inspired movie.First of all, Disney stretched their production budget as far as they needed to and it is clear that no expense was spared. From the celestial couture of the \"Mrs.\" and their frequent extravagant costume changes to the sweeping CGI landscapes and the shimmering waves of the \"tesser\" this production team really outdid itself in spectacular fashion. The visuals alone make it worthwhile and certainly worthy of a trip to the theater.There's no denying that Wrinkle is a story that played well when it was written originally in the 1960's, nestled in the pages of a book that you might have read in the 4th grade. It's an easy read, but a hard movie to bring to the screen. The plot of the book is choppy, and the film stayed true to that, making sharp jumps from mesmerizing planet to planet, as well as scene to scene. There are some departures from the source material that seemed to be an attempt at overcoming the issues with the narrative therein, but it was clear that it hurt more than it helped. And while there weren't any gaping holes in the plot, there are quite a few moments that don't seem to make a whole lot of sense - even though we've read the book. But bridging the gaps in the narrative seemed to take a backseat to reinforcing the overall themes of the film, and perhaps that's okay.The end result is a film that's completely digestible, regardless of the issues it might have. Every performance is strong, the message is powerful, and it makes strides for diversity and representation. As we said in our Annihilation review, we are all for smart, POC women taking the screen in roles as doctors and scientists, and in this case, a twelve-year-old physics prodigy that learns to love her natural hair.Featuring: An immaculate performance by Reese Witherspoon. And one cannot ignore Disney's typical outstanding ability to sound mix, perfectly matching the orchestral arrangements to the mood in every scene, down to the second.",

            "content": "'A Wrinkle in Time', Disney's next blockbuster book adaptation done by newcomer director, Ava DuVernay staring Storm Reid, Oprah Winfrey, Reese Witherspoon, and Chris Pine. Director wise the film is beautiful with its fun filled world and well constructed sceneries with beautiful creatures and unique action sequences too. But the directing is where I get worried, it almost felt like the film overuses visuals to attempt to get audiences to forget that there's a story to tell in this film with scenes that last almost ten minutes with no purpose for the story or character progression. And these scenes have little to no dialogue so it's purely director driven in these. Yes they look beautiful but they don't pay any purpose for this film. And the first act is very clunky with its introduction to many characters and ignoring a lot of blaring questions that should be answered for the audience to have at least a little of connection to the story minus the A list cast. (Later I'll talk about the third act though in the Script section.) Acting wise, every comes strong with this film. Each character is either mysterious, comical, or carry extremely wise words that translate to today flawlessly. By far my favorite performance in the film had to be Reese with her constantly changing her mind and quirkiness too. Overall all the actors though were good but some of them felt underused or irrelevant in this film though as just 'fill in' characters or people to just have a respectable role for an A list actor. And viewing the film it struggles to tell what characters give importance to the story or are just there for a laugh for a familiar face. The script is by far the weakest part of the film with extremely long scenes of exposition and ironically a lack of actual explanation of a lot of scenes and why a lot of events occur in this film. Much of the dialogue delivered by a handful of characters don't feel natural, some of it is because of bad acting and others is from a robotic script. I found a few scenes in this film to be boring honestly with its use of visuals that either make no sense, or once again give nothing to the story. And the third act gives a half fast ending and no real explanation on why most of the film occurs. Leaving a lot of plot holes and fans confused as to why their favorite book from their childhood is being adapted so poorly. The film comes off of as a mess in many different categories and left me and a lot of fans and critics not satisfied and confused when the credits begin to roll. A Wrinkle in Time gets a 4.25/10",

Thank God I didn't buy a ticket when it came out.Well, here we go. First, the movie is a fantasy, right? So, what's a fantasy? It's something really impossible, magical, incredible, that would never happen, but the storytelling job is to make you believe that it could happen. Am I right? But here's the thing, the movie definitely does not make you believe a thing. You're never invested on the characters, in fact, you're never entertained by it! Really, we could go even further, and say that you don't even know what the heck the film is about. They've failed miserably on doing a fantasy movie.The CGI. My Goood! The CGI! They say the movie's budget was something around 100 million dollars. But, really, the \"climax\" reminded me of Sharkboy and Lavagirl (yes, it's that bad sometimes).The soundtrack is awful, there isn't a \"line\" that they followed, it seemed just a bunch of sounds put together.The story is just confusing, everything happens so oddly fast. Like, the guy randomly shows up where they are, and, what? Was it some force of the universe that we never hear about later? I really don't even know what to say, until some point half way through the movie, I didn't even know what it was about.And, well, we would eventually get to that. The kids. Yes, the acting is bad, really bad, the girl (Storm Reid), and the little boy (Deric McCabe), who are the main character of the film, aren't good here. But, let me say this, I do not blame them for that, this one is on the director, and the people who casted them. You can just give the 7 years old boy 15 minutes of monologues if he can't handle it. In fact, McCabe was fine in the first 30 minutes or so of the movie, but when he stars to have more and more lines... just didn't work. The girl is bad from the beginning to the end. I hope it's just the director here and she has some talent. The other boy (Levi Miller) is just fine, he doesn't have that much lines, so it's ok.So, in order to not seem I'm just bashing on the movie. There is once really good sequence (is probably one or two minutes long, you might found it on YouTube), is when they talked about what \"the it\" is really about, and we see the whole \"evil\" that is on humankind. But this makes me even more upset, cause here is the potential that the movie had! I saw the attempts to have messages throughout the entire movie, but they just never work.I would say that the adult actors are fine. There are indeed lots of talent actors here. Man, this movie could have been just awesome! But sadly, it isn't.Well, to sum up, A Wrinkle in Time had potential but it stilled on paper, and it's a shame. I have to say, if you didn't see it yet. Don't. Just don't.2,5/10",

She became a producer, I learned after 2 years of college calculus that it just wasn't for me after all and went on to other things. But we both continued to love the book 56 years later. What everyone who reads the book and watches the movie needs to understand is the need to view it from the eyes of much younger person. I see reviews by adults. I have yet to see a review by an 11-year-old. So, since I went to see it with my daughter and my 11-year-old granddaughter, I interviewed them and my 9-year-old and 7-year-old granddaughters to get their opinion of the movie. Here it is: \"It was great!\"\nEven my 2-year-old grandson who is the definition of squirmy, sat on his mom's lap and watched the wonder and magic of it all. \nIs it hard to follow if you haven't read the book-yes, so read the book. Does it assume you will listen and pay attention to what is going on-yes, so put down your phone, stop talking, and pay attention.

Is Meg the hero-yes, she is because she doesn't give up, she is stubborn, and she knows what is important. I would give this a 9 because it could have done a better job of tying in the title with the mode of travel-tesseract. They really needed the ants on a string analogy.

As the movie is based on an acclaimed novel, which indeed is, it's not the fault of the story, but the fault lies on how the script has been adapted. It is true that is not an easy story to adapt to the big screen and less easy is to addapt it to a film under two hours. The fault doesn't specifically lie on which things have been prioritized before others and which things have been changed (skin colors, gender, character with more weight, characters that disappear). The things that have been changed aren't the cause of the failure of this movie, but most of the problem is which parts of the story have been shown and how long have been presented to the audience. While the book keeps going at a fast pace, never stopping, never letting you breath, the movie goes fast in some aspects that should be taken more slowly and goes really slowly in some aspects that should be gone in two seconds.Plus, the movie seem like a Oprah show. Why is she taking so much screen? (literally speaking, if you have watched the movie you will know what I am talking about). It's ok to put black actors on the screen to appeal to a bigger audience, but please, the main character is the girl, not Oprah's characters.

            "content": "Everyone seems to be throwing shade on Disney for being too attached to franchises and not doing anything original. They are definitely a studio that recycles ideas and makes them into unique new things, so they are always worthy of applause, no matter how familiar one of their films may seem. I was very much looking forward to A Wrinkle in Time. I had no prior knowledge of its source material, so I was seeing it as an original film that was hitting theatres sometime soon. That time has now come, and although I'm something who tries to see the best in every film that I watch, there's no denying that this one just doesn't quite feel right. Not to say this is a bad movie by any means, but here's why it fails to reach its potential on multiple occasions.After her father disappears and ends up somewhere distant in the universe, his daughter Meg is sent by three women on a quest through time and space to locate him. Accompanied by her younger brother Charles Wallace and newfound friend Clavin, the three of them embark on a strange journey across the universe. With unique visuals surround each and every scene and a fantastic performance by Storm Reid in the leading role, the epic scale, and emotional impact are truly what will win over the viewers. Aside from those elements, this is a fairly sloppy movie that tries a little too hard to be unique.Without ruining the film, it relies very heavily on the character of Charles Wallace to heighten certain aspects of the story. For that reason, the film suffers from a few laughable lines of dialogue, due to the fact that Deric McCabe may not have been the right kid to cast in this particular role. I was taken out of many dramatic moments, simply because I just wasn't buying into the way he was delivering his lines.On top of that, the three goddesses in Mindy Kaling, Reese Witherspoon, and Oprah Winfrey are present for a purpose, but they could've easily been excluded from the film once they bring the main characters to the places they need to be. They're quite annoying and simply unnecessary when it came to the story itself. Witherspoon was solid, but that's only because she had more things to do with her role than the others.The most frustrating part about this film is that Chris Pine is great in this movie and the conclusion of the third act felt earned and I found myself emotionally invested and caring about certain characters. The reason that aspect of the film is frustrating is that the film deviates too much from his character and it just feels like it drags quite a while before reaching him. That's a huge problem, especially when reflecting on the fact that the runtime is a mere 109 minutes.In the end, A Wrinkle in Time may have been a much better film with a few re-writes and about 20-30 minutes added on in order to expand the world a little more. The editing felt choppy at times, certain characters appear in places without explanation, and the solid visuals aren't enough to elevate the sloppy plot execution. Yes, there are a few great performances and the core story is worth watching, but there are too many problems surrounding that element to really send anyone out to see this in theatres. This is a neat and complex idea that would've worked as a much grander and elongated epic. Ava Duvernay is a fantastic director that tried a little too hard to impress here and I truly hate to have to admit that about this promising storyline.

Although this is supposedly an adaptation of a children's book that has compassionate deep Christian overtones, the movie really screws with you automatically and it becomes less and less of an adaptation. The movie does have Reese Witherspoon as a character named Mrs. Whatsit and Chris Pine, along with Oprah Winfrey, but this movie stars a little known actress named Storm Reid who plays Meg, a socially awkward outcast with glasses, but because she has glasses doesn't make you an outcast. Her dad, Dr Alex Murray (Pine) disappears and she's teased for it. WOW! Not only that, she's bullied, but Winfrey plays a character named Mrs. Which, who is a giant. This movie may look nice, but the story didn't hold my interest. I really don't know how to make a movie with this big and unreasonable source material, as I'm sure it could have been done better than this. I appreciate Witherspoon though.

            "content": "Let me start off by saying this is one of those movies with a great trailer but fails to deliver come showtime. You are free to leave while you still can because it's gonna get ugly from here on out.Based on the science fantasy novel of the same name released in 1962, it follows the story of Meg who aided by three mythical beings go on a quest to find her missing father. Classic plot enough to bring in the dollar for Disney, right? On top of that, you got a great cast featuring Reese Witherspoon, Chris Pine and even Michael Pena but just the same they weren't enough to save the movie from \"tessering\" to disaster territory.First the positives: Chris Pine was able to give great acting even though he was given barely anything to work with. I once outrightly dismissed him after seeing him in 'Just My Luck', back in 2006 when Lindsay Lohan was still a thing. He's steadily improved since, between 'This Means War', 'Wonder Woman' and now this. Also worth mentioning is 8yr old Fil-American Deric McCabe who played Charles Wallace. Yes there were some annoying moments (such as the confrontation in the white room) but he showed acting potential and we should see more of him in the future.Now the negatives: The story had so many loopholes and you would know this because you'd wonder about something and even though the cast is just standing there talking no one is explaining it to you. Editing was poorly done and if I had to take a guess I would surmise it's because there weren't a lot of good takes to work with. Even the soundtrack didn't work. I mean I love Sade but the song they chose did not give the feels for the scene they used it for.Lastly the so-sos: Oprah was Oprah, Reese was also Reese and I'm kinda mixed about her performance, like I'm seeing a preview of what to expect in Legally Blonde 4. Mindy, again was the token diversity actress, but that's a progress, from African-Americans we're moving to Asians. In addition, the family in the book was changed from Caucasian to Multiracial in the movie, and I also read somewhere that the book's Christian undertones were heavily edited and they used neutral terms such as light and darkness. While being inclusive opens up more opportunities for everyone, it feels like they spent too much time focusing on that instead of the story therefore it felt forced rather than letting it happen naturally.I'd like to say that this is your usual Disney movie and go watch with your kids, but honestly just watch the trailer and proceed to the next movie on your list.",

            "review_title": "A well-intentioned mess that manages to be weird - and yet also not weird enough.",
            "content": "Since its publication in 1962, Madeleine L'Engle's A Wrinkle In Time has gained a reputation for being unfilmable... for good reason. The book mixes science fiction and Christian theology in an epic odyssey across time, space and the universe - in ways that are endlessly charming to fans, and frustratingly messy to detractors. L'Engle's defiantly episodic tale provides as many pitfalls as opportunities for aspiring filmmakers - accordingly, director Ava DuVernay winds up getting about as much right as she gets wrong.Meg Murry (Storm Reid) - full of youth, self-loathing and abandonment issues - is the prickly heart of the film. It's been four years since her physicist dad (Chris Pine) disappeared, and Meg is still falling apart. But everything changes when her precocious six-year-old brother, Charles Wallace (Deric McCabe), invites a most peculiar stranger into their home. Before long, Mrs Whatsit (Reese Witherspoon) and her two equally unusual friends, Mrs Who (Mindy Kaling) and Mrs Which (Oprah Winfrey), invite the Murry siblings and their new friend, Calvin (Levi Miller), on a journey that will take them to the darkest corners of the galaxy - which might well include the very depths of their own souls.In narrative terms, A Wrinkle In Time makes the canny decision to focus firmly on Meg in moving the story forward. While Meg was also the primary protagonist in the book, L'Engle spent almost as much time dwelling on what made her two male companions so special. The film chooses to lavish more attention on Meg, allowing her and all her insecurities and contradictions to anchor the entire adventure. It's Meg whose undying devotion to her father knocks the travellers off-course, and Meg who refuses to give up when loss threatens to claim her loved ones.On this count, at least, the final result is something quite lovely. Meg is achingly real - an awkward young girl who can neither take nor believe compliments about herself, but who has the potential to change the world if only she can find her confidence and voice. Reid is fantastic in the part, credibly convincing audiences that Meg's faults might also be her gifts - that the outsized amount of love in her heart is not something she needs to hide or play down. It's an empowering message for girls and boys, and probably the best thing about DuVernay's otherwise uneven adaptation.Unfortunately, the rest of A Wrinkle In Time lingers somewhere in the key of mediocre. For a book like L'Engle's, every choice made in changing or updating the novel for the screen will invariably invite debate. Viewers and readers will be discussing for years to come whether Meg's perfectly ordinary twin brothers should have been cut out of the family, and if the film's glamorous, purely Hollywoodian depiction of the three mysterious Mrses somehow makes them less - rather than more - interesting.Where it really counts, however, Jennifer Lee's screenplay seems determined to avoid as much controversy as possible. The film steers almost entirely clear of what made the book such a seminal work of children's literature, paring away the Christian themes and allegories L'Engle embedded in her story and characters. And yet, it retains a lot of the more peculiar detours taken by the book, from visiting a Happy Medium (Zach Galifianakis) to encountering a sinister man with red eyes (Michael Pena). As a result, A Wrinkle In Time is almost as random and weird as the book on which it's based - but lacks the layers and soul that help make the weirdness work.To be fair, there are plenty of enjoyable moments threaded throughout DuVernay's film. If you accept it for what it is, Meg's hero journey is irresistible and important for generations of young girls who will see themselves in her as she steps up and takes charge. Some of the modern updates are hugely welcome - from the diversity of the characters to a quite wonderful Hamilton reference. The cast, too, is uniformly appealing. Witherspoon, in particular, is having the time of her life as the chirpy, chatty Mrs Whatsit;, while Chris Pine continues his streak of playing white, male characters that we don't often see on screen by injecting his performance with a dark fragility.Nonetheless, it's hard to shake the feeling that A Wrinkle In Time could have been so much more. In the hands of DuVernay (and, of course, Disney), the film is visually arresting, turning up the gloss, colour saturation and special effects to elicit full eye-popping wonder. But all the visual resplendence in the world can't disguise the messiness of the film's central themes and ideas. In effect, DuVernay's adaptation - a blockbuster that comes across as safe and generic when it should be bold and unusual - has things of its own to say but, in so doing, it largely misses L'Engle's point.",

            "content": "I saw A Wrinkle in Time today. The first half hour or so had potential, as the little brother was set up as an articulate champion of justice type who dressed down two teachers for spreading malicious gossip about him and his family, and then supported his sister. All this while apparently marshaling the powers that be of the universe to help find their missing father. The sister started out with some potential too, beating up a particularly vicious bully and walking out on a principal who was trying to tear her down without getting the whole story behind her actions first. The acting and makeup for the 3 universe goddess ladies was rather off-putting and honestly came off as TV movie quality, but the CGI once they crossed over to a new place was impressive. Unfortunately, the whole movie falls flat on its face immediately after that and never recovers. Leaving the heavy-handed and insufficiently heartfelt scene with the seer out, the little brother disappears briefly without explanation (only to reappear later also without explanation) during which time the kids run through a supernatural natural disaster of sorts and escape in a barely believable (even in the context of fantasy) way. Shortly after the little brother reappears, he touches the hand of one baddie and suddenly turns into a power-mad villain, which makes no sense since he showed no signs of avarice up to that point and not a drop of darkness in his personality to be used in turning him. If anything, the setup made him seem more likely to end up the hero of the story. This is just clumsy writing. When they finally find the father, despite the fact he's been trapped in the core of evil for the whole universe for 4 years, he shows no signs of having changed in any way - plus he was way too easy to find but that's another issue. Then, even though he's supposed to have been trapped there, he just decides to teleport him and his daughter back home at will. What!?! Couldn't he have done that, say 4 years earlier if it was that simple!?! Also, when he teleports away and the daughter wills herself to stay to go after her brother, the boyfriend is nowhere near and in the end the daughter and her brother go home without the boyfriend... and yet he's there when they arrive home... with no explanation whatsoever. Oh, and one more plot hole regarding the boyfriend. The little brother asked him to come along because they needed his sense of diplomacy, but he never used it once. He barely even spoke. Both he and the little brother had considerable potential as characters, but were not really used at all. What a waste. Finally, the climax \"battle\" scene of the film kind of undermined the moral of the story (that you should like yourself the way you are) since the argument the daughter made to un-evil her brother was that they loved each other and therefore he couldn't be evil. Huh?Oh, one last note. There was one little moment when the bother yelled to the sister \"Shut up, Meg!\" Surely someone working on that movie must have seen the show Family Guy once in their life and realized that line would have all the wrong pop culture connotations for a moderately large portion of the audience? I mean, seriously, I don't watch that show and even I know that catchphrase. There was a lot of laughter in the theater at that moment, and I think that's why.I'm guessing something important in the original written story was excised from the screenplay to fill it so full of holes. If not, then this is just a very disappointing story all around. Thematically and stylistically, it wants to be Neverending Story, but it just isn't. At all. Not even close.",

I was worried when Michael Pena was cast as the villain, because generally his roles are comedic, and even when he's playing a villain, like in ''My Little Pony: The Movie\" it's as the main villains' sidekick/comic relief. Surprisingly, he did a good job. The character in the story is supposed to be an allegory for the devil, and while he wasn't as creepy as I would have liked, he did add another element to the character by posing as friendly in order to tempt the main characters more. They also got rid of the part of the story with Aunt Beast. (Yay! Seriously. What were those things? Chewbacca's second cousins? Whatever they were, I always hated that part as I felt it slowed the plot down and added nothing. By cutting that part they proved how unnecessary it was and the story still works without it.) Being a Disney film, they of course toned down the creepiness of the planet Camazotz. (Boo!) I would have preferred it to be as scary as the book and 2003 film. It was still a bit unsettling, but not as much as it should have been. Overall, I thought this was a fine adaptation, albeit a slightly flawed one.\nGrade: A- 9/10 3.5/5 stars",

I wish at the end of that 1hr40min disaster I'd not only been blind, but also deaf and rather stupid.From start to end, it just lacks any depth, any story, any satisfaction at all other than the occasional bit of great special effects work. The timeline is all over the place, the characters are shallow and lacking any depth that gives you an investment in who they are or what they are doing, and the acting is at best little better than what I would expect of C grade actors. I think Chris and Reese just turned up for a day or two in-between another more interesting and better paid project, meanwhile Oprah just didn't have much else on that month.I really did ponder if I had fallen asleep and missed a main part of the story, but no, I evidently didn't and what seems to be some large jumps in storytelling were indeed what this film had.Maybe it's a kids film, and they might be too daft to notice all the holes and flaws in general, but these days I doubt that. Basically it was just a terrible film, made no worse perhaps by Oprah and her 'acting', but certainly made no better by the supposedly good actors involved.What I find most marvellous is the fact Disney and others continue to no doubt spend millions on this sort of garbage, when that money might be better spent else where, or donated to the poor and homeless. And whoever wrote this script (adapted it from the book I suppose), should be marched immediately out of the office and banished into the nothing.

Meg meets the three ladies Mrs. Who (Mindy Kaling), Mrs. Which (Oprah Winfrey), and Mrs. Whatsit (Reese Witherspoon) and they go to a beautiful planet, were the flowers speak to each other. They fly through a sky from a mystical transformed creature. Then, they travel to a rocky balanced setting, were they meet Zach Galifianakis's character. Then, to a dark place called the it, were all the dark negative energy lies upon. It is a fun adventure to see these beautiful visual effects. Which is also the weakness of this film as well. When the film relies on visuals over storytelling. Storm Reid did perfect with her performance. You grow to like her character. Levi Miller was also okay as well that has an attraction to Meg. Chris Pine was good as her father for the brief moments that he is on screen. Reese Witherspoon and Mindy Kaling were great as well. What did not work with A Wrinkle in Time? Like I said above, the film relying on visuals over storytelling. The movie is all visual effects and there may be scenes were it is overdone. But the plot is thin. It is about a father's passion in discovering new planets in different universes. And the voyage to the unknown. When Meg goes traveling to one visual fest set piece to another. Meeting new characters and getting a lead to another new setting. There is not much of a story when characters are just traveling to another eye candy visual set piece. There is a theme of love in the film. But does poorly on trying to execute a story. Also, I feel like Oprah Winfrey, Deric McCabe, and Michael Pena's performances were just dull. Winfrey as Mrs. Which did not have any depth with the character. Deric McCabe did decent as a genius kid. Michael Pena as Red was just terrible.Overall, A Wrinkle in Time is a fair film. The visual effects are spectacular but overwhelming. The plot is thin and forgettable. Storm Reid was great and some decent performances from the supporting cast. Otherwise, I will recommend the film as a rental unless you are a fan of the book or want to see some stunning visuals on the big screen.",

But it exceeded my expectations... meaning that I didn't expect it to be this awful.You wouldn't believe it, I certainly wouldn't believe it either if someone told me... but these people spent 100-million dollars for a movie with no sets at all (everything is low grade CGI). But the most significant, inconceivable point is that the plot involves children going to a magical land where everything is magical, and you know, filled with magic and stuff that has magic in it... with the added bonus of magic. You know? Flying creatures, beautiful landscape, which is supposed to make the kids in the audience \"woooow!\" like their onscreen counterparts, and carry them away for two hours.Which could very well happen, of course. But only if the kids in the audience haven't seen any of the eight Harry Potter films. Or the Narnia films. Or the Lord Of The Rings films. Or Spiderwick. Or Labyrinth. Or any of the dime-a-dozen, you-get-free-with-any-10-dollar-purchase children's animation DVDs.

This movie basically glossed right over those, which took out so much of the joy of the story. I went with someone who never read the book and she was so confused over this entire movie's concept, basically because the entire middle of the story-line was missing.

I think the actors would actually do a very good job if it wasn't for the director, they all have potential but unfortunately, they wasted their talents on poor directing and writing.The cast is miscast. Something about Storm Reid just didn't feel like Meg to me, she did pretty well portraying her insecure personality but she just seemed robotic when Meg was much more of an emotional character in the book. I guess it's because adapting a book character as emotional as Meg would make the movie too dramatic but when strange things would be happening, she would be like \"Oh okay...\" she didn't show much expressions of curiosity, fear, confusion etc.. Mrs. Whatsit played by Reese Witherspoon just seemed too excitable. Also, Reese Witherspoon is like in her 40s while I saw Mrs. Whatsit as an older woman. Mrs. Who, played by Mindy Kaling would mostly talk in quotes and would even say things that didn't feel natural to the scenes. Charles Wallace is supposed to be 5 yet Deric McCabe looks like he's 9. And Calvin has the cliched love-at-first-sight thing going on, swooning over Meg's hair and how she's hot.The only good things I can say about the movie were the visuals and most of the more fast-paced scenes. They were fun to watch. But all in all, this is an unfaithful adaptation of a book that takes out some important parts from the book and adds some new ones.I do believe \"A Wrinkle in Time\" book has the potential to get adapted to a good film, maybe not an excellent film because the book is too complex to be made into a wonderful film.",

I kept waiting to see more magical moments coming from these three roles but only met with the lack of it. This movie missed numerous opportunities to deliver some comedic moment/line either from the three misses or the children. Talking bout the children, yeah they're cute and pretty all that but there's nothing really making them quite likeable especially the main child, Meg. She's described as unorganised, problematic, aggressive kid but all of these characteristics were only proven in the movie in 1 scene only and what, they thought that is enough to make us believe that she is this out of control, problematic girl?? Heck no. As mentioned, there is nothing really likeable or relatable with the character Meg and so its hard to care for her and in the end, I just can't help but to not rooting for her. She is in this magical journey with her lil bro and friend but all she keep doing was complaining, but at the same wanting to save her father. How the heck do you wanna save your father when all you do is complain? Anyway, no hate towards the child but I do believe if they chosen another well performed child actor for the role of Meg, it'd be a better character.

The film was directed by Ava DuVernay (who also helmed the critically acclaimed Oscar nominees 'SELMA' and '13TH'), and it was scripted by Jennifer Lee. The movie is based on the book (of the same name) by Madeleine L'Engle. It stars Storm Reid, Levi Miller, Deric McCabe, Oprah Winfrey, Reese Witherspoon, Mindy Kaling, Chris Pine, Gugu Mbatha-Raw, Michael Pena and Zach Galifianakis. The film has received mostly negative reviews from critics so far, and it's just a modest hit at the Box Office as well. I found it to be pretty to look at, but it's also pretty boring and uninspiring. Meg Murry (Reid), and her younger brother Charles Wallace (McCabe), have been bullied at school ever since their astrophysicist father, Alex (Pine), went missing years earlier. Then one day Meg learns that he's being held captive on another planet. So Meg, Charles Wallace, and Meg's new friend Calvin O'Keefe (Miller), set out to rescue him. They get help from three magical astral travelers (Winfrey, Witherspoon and Kaling). The movie is always beautiful to look at, and I really wanted to like it. Largely because it has a diverse cast, with multiple minority and female leads in it, and it was directed by an African-American woman. If the movie's not good, it's just not good though. It did have a lot of potential, I'll admit, and it's a decent kids' movie (I probably would have liked it a lot more when I was that age). It's also well intentioned obviously. I think it would have been better served with a much smaller budget though. Sure it wouldn't have been as visually stunning (which is it's one saving grace), but I think DuVerany could have focused a lot more on it's heart (and message) that way. I also would have cast three different (better) actresses as the astral travelers.",

Disney made sure to make it as PC as possible and glitzed it up to make the Mrs. W's more like fairy godmothers and the scenes more Alice in Wonderland and less scary than the book. I remember parts of the book being incredibly terrifying. The only scary scene in the movie was more Pirates of the Caribbean scary, not terrifying. So many key scenes and aspects were left out, some of which include the fact that there were also twin boys, the Murray's lived on a farm with an orchard, stone fence and star gazing rock, the Mrs. W's first appeared as bag ladies, the boy who dropped his ball in the synced bouncing scene. Many of these elements come into play later, in either this book or the series, and were completely ignored. The only saving grace of this movie was some of the acting. Charles Wallace was excellent. Calvin would have been great, too, had they actually delved into his character and his relationship with Meg properly. Meg, one of my all time favorite female characters and an inspiration as an awkward adolescent, was totally flat and unbelievable. Was it terrible writing or terrible casting? I don't know.

Storm Reid should be proud that this got to be her breakthrough!",

And not gonna lie, there was a moment where i almost fell asleep while watching this and my friend did too. I could hear her yawning and snoozing!

            "content": "I still don't know why I watched this film this weekend but I as a self professed lover of film needed to keep judgment out while watching this film. It was hard having an open mind because the trailers looked....well.... bad. I was hoping for something smart and entertaining at least. While the film isn't as bad as I thought it was there's plenty of problems that ruin the film and outweigh some of the positives. I think young children will enjoy this because they won't pay attention to its flaws.The film is about a girl named Meg and her quest to find her astrophysicist father who disappeared 4 years prior. She soon realizes that reality is not what it seems and her father is being held captive on a foreign planet by an evil force named The It which attempts to engulf the universe. The film is noticeable for its diversity in cast and story and for being the first 9 figure budget picture directed by a woman of color. While I ca appreciate that aspect of the background of the film and the ambitious effort by Ava DuVernay, the film is still a mess.Some of the positives. The film definitely means well and the younger crowd should be impressed by the visuals and adventurous themes. Some of the passages of the journey of the film are also cool. Now the bad, the child actors really aren't good. Especially the younger brother. I can't really blame them because they are kids, but it was distracting. There is lots of CGI, some parts look great and others the effects are very noticeable. There's also storytelling flaws. Things aren't explained well and we are meant to just accept thing as \"oh yeah science\". It gets frustrating when inexplicable things happen for the sake of it.I must admit the film is nowhere near as bad as I anticipated. Parts of the film are interesting. Most however is hard to connect with and get emotionally involved in. I'm sure there are people out there whoa re perfectly satisfied with this judging by the applause it received in the theater from other moviegoers. For me though, its a big budget film that needed to be much more to warrant an impact.5.5/10",

            "content": "The film feels like it was produced by The IT itself - so arranged, artificial, by the template - that it as a whole reminded of the scary suburban street with copy-paste houses and inhabitants. Calculatedly pleasing to the eye, but otherwise lifeless. I guess there were the good intentions and perhaps even the talented ensemble - but The IT in the form of the big badass corporation as Disney, in the board of directors, distorted manager's minds, pseudo-psychology calculations on what \"moves\" and \"sells\" to the audience and all \"the science\" of the business ... could hardly produce anything else than the tombstone to the deluded corporate world, Hollywood style.Don't get me on praising \"at least the stunning visual effects\". They are unimaginative kytsch, boring, underwhelming - considering what we have seen already. No, nowadays spectators cannot be stimulated by quantity, nor by colors anymore. That's not the way to go. Is that the storytelling and acting and directing of the 21st century - people interacting with random \"cool\" CGIs, almost detached from reality? \"I am flying. I am walking the imaginary stairs. I am interacting with zillions of flying dots. I am changing shape and colors.\" Is that all to the contemporary kid's souls - interacting with VFX? The three godfairies, divas, drag queens - or whatever - are sort of an emblem of this production: Lavishly dressed, but static, statue-like, arranged (symmetrically) ... lifeless.Good=light, evil=darkness? Seriously? What about the potential of art to challenge the status quo, cliches, moralism, cheapness, simplification ... and thus educate?That good=nice vs evil=mean is so neatly contrasted, that there it leaves no space for real-life characters, emotions, or audience's connection.I appreciate the irony towards suburban dystopia - or the overcrowded beach scenes ... yeah, the standardized normal families, the template lives, the template fun, the template joy - epileptically colorful and in the same time same, alike, interchangeable - but that theme could have been juiced endlessly. As an independent movie.Oh my, where are the times of The Toys at least.",

            "content": "One thing about the vast majority of movies and are either not well made or just plain bad usually is of no fault of the actors involved. The actors all did a great job and I refuse to fault them for this movie doing so badly. I think all of them did a great job and that needs to be said. However, when the story does not come together and the script is bad, and when, in this case, the book does not follow certain thing crucial to the story, then it seems that often times it can look like a bad performance on their part which is very unfair. I also wonder how much is on the editing room floor.I do think it's great when a story adapted from a book can be reimagined using more modern day situations and events that are more relatable if it's possible and this one should have been one of those. For instance, Calvin's dad being very demanding. We do not actually \"see\" his dad in the novel, we see his mother who is a worn out, bitter woman who is a bit abusive. But, the book seems to be missing some characters such as Meg and Charles Wallace twin brothers. Other things that were changed were things like who Meg was. She was a \"trouble maker\" meaning that she was assertive in a \"rage against the machines\" type of way. In this version, Meg seems more like a push over who cowers at things instead of \"fighting back.\" I have read A Wrinkle in Time\" twice and Meg's dad was not gone for so long. Basically, the movie was missing half it's characters or a lot of them anyway.\nThings happened very fast whereas the book and the previous 2003 version, the TV Movie, showed a longer passage of time. It felt very rushed, had little character development on a lot of the characters, had frayed ends in the story to the point where it just became annoying and unwatchable. I had a hard time following it and it felt like it was saying nothing with a whole lot. It will be interesting to see if an uncut version comes out, but it is still missing two important characters, the twin brothers, in the story.. It was oversimplified and should have been a longer movie.So, I would not recommend this movie to anyone who has read any of Madeleine L'Engle's books about the Murray?O'Keefe family aka the Kairos series.",

The book had so many layered themes in it, and I can understand not being able to show them all effectively, or some upgrades from the cold war era feel, but to pretty much chuck the whole second half of the book out in favor of some hard to follow mind trip really suffered.If you can get past that, overall it wasn't bad, but it also wasn't great.

A good amount of the film simply does not make sense (How was the father being detained? What is the relevance of Veronica, Rowan Blanchard's character? Furthermore, what was the relevance of Calvin?). I think that the story never quite realized its purpose and just seemed to be going through the motions. The director, Ava Duvernay, has proved herself more than capable, yet her style here is almost laughable. I just think the director, and part of the cast was mis-chosen, which is a sentiment frequently proved throughout the film. The effects, for the most part, were haphazardly done, and I felt the film was generally at its strongest when dealing with literal backgrounds and sets, rather than a CGI/green screened backdrop. For example, the scene in which Mrs. Who interacts with Charles Wallace has an engaging and interesting feel to it, even if the acting and directing is lacking. In conclusion, unless you are a die-hard Disney fan who has taken a blood oath to read every. single. film. they release, I do not encourage \"A Wrinkle In Time.\" I hate to say it, but even \"Sherlock Gnomes\" would be more focused.2/10\n20%\nF",

A bold scientist suddenly disappears as he attempts to discover an alternate reality, four years later his daughter and son become embroiled in a rescue mission which in turn becomes a quest to save the universe. Adapting the unadaptable will gain praise from me, just for the sheer bravery and boldness of such an attempt. But in hindsight some stories just cannot be adapted cinematically, this is one of them. The technical aspects are the selling point, fantasy worlds filled with bright vibrant colours and imaginative environments. A rather surreal experience with many ethereal scenes, such as the process of \"tessering\". It maintained my interest through visual awe and delight. DuVernay's direction is splendid and surprisingly makes the transition from powerful dramas to big budget blockbusters effortlessly. The acting was solid, particularly Pine who brings some much needed emotion and Winfrey whose physical prowess portrays a commanding character. The major issues I have inherently come from the screenplay and narrative. The dialogue is consistently filled with exposition, leaving little room for backstory and character development. It's purely focussing on universe-building and crafting creative landscapes, a minimal amount of attention was made to creating a cohesive plot. I mean honestly, many aspects were incomprehensible as it leaves you questioning \"what the hell is going on!? How did that happen? Why is he there? Who are these Mrs's beings?\" The countless lingering plot holes will infuriate older audiences, whilst the complicated narrative is too advanced for younger viewers. The theme of love is dealt heavy handedly that it left me face palming myself. This is no means a horrific film, with some being slightly too harsh.

It may have been talking about a popular girl struggling with an eating disorder and a great student being bullied by his father to do even better. But for me it looked like a perfect illustration of what has been happening in our world politically over the last couple of years. There were a few more poignant moments in the film. But, unfortunately, just moments. And there was just one character that felt alive - Charles Wallace. He made me cry real tears. Little Deric McCabe outacted a bunch of grownups, some of whom are Oscar winners. Reese Witherspoon, whom I loved in so many different roles, was just all Legally Blonde here. Poor Mindy Kahling was reduced to smiling and saying words that weren't even her character's own. Oprah was being Oprah - no more, no less. Chris Pine was stuck in a permanent state of angst. And Zack Galifianakis made an attempt to liven up his character, but was quickly subdued into a state of permanent soulfulness. It is so sad to see all these great performers acting as if they were making a photo shoot for the movie, not the movie itself. Or better yet - one of those fake rides they have at Universal Studios. In fact, much of the film felt as if they were already thinking about a ride as they were making it. My 9 year old liked it. Hopefully it will make him want to read the book. Then it will be worth it.",

It's not like other Disney films that are timeless and you can watch them years after they came out as a 30 year old and you still love them. The dialogue and the plot are most certainly written for children, and as someone who is not a child it was sort of cringey and awkward to watch. It has a good overall message and theme that is really not subtle at all (hence why it's good for children), but just don't expect this to be the kind of Disney movie that anyone at any age can enjoy.",

I only wish they had spent more time highlighting why the book was so good to begin with. They didn't have to put it all on Meg rescuing everyone. In the book it's a team effort out of love and friendship, so the parts of the book where they cut out the other characters sacrificing themselves or offering to sacrifice themselves for each other and the total unselfishness of characters like Calvin or Meg's father could have helped pack the emotional punch of this movie. Calvin had much more to do in the book, why cut that out? Giving him nothing to do didn't help develop why he is there to help Meg. He and Meg had growth in their character arcs in ths book. Why just show 1 scene of Calvin having problems with his father, why not develop that a bit more. Develop Charles Wallace being continuously teased or show a montage of it if you're short on time. I really really really hate they didn't have Aunt Beast in there, the ending was totally silly and half-cooked. And developing the three Missuses much more...maybe DuVernay should have picked the TV miniseries format with a longer running time with more room for character motivation and development and had a screenwriter writing more true to the spirit of the actual novel.\nI truly admire the colorblindness the film tried to be, but it would have helped to have more meaty story on this film's bones and kept in more of the best things about the book than focusing on the CGI. Way too watered down for my tastes. Respect the audience! We are smarter than you think we are!",

When you saw the children meet Oprah, Kaling, and Witherspoon on the other planet, this was in the trailer, that was the highlight of the movie. I thought it would have been visually stunning, but it lacked in that department too. This movie was pretty much Disney's Eragon. It failed miserably.

            "content": "Children's books will never be easy to adapt for new generations. Not just because of generational gaps of the state of mind when it was written, but also the expectation of holding filmmakers to the standard that a book indirectly sets (even if it doesn't translate to film). While in recent years, Ava DuVernay has established herself directing impressive urban dramas (Selma, Middle of Nowhere) and finds herself stepping into the Disney fantasy land, and while young children can have fun in her world, adults may find a few more wrinkles than expected.The film follows Meg (Storm Reid) who is at a lost after dealing with the disappearance of her father (Chris Pine). Suddenly Meg's little brother discovers three witches who help Meg, her brother and a close friend try to discover why their father hasn't come home.Ava DuVernay is very much staging an ambitious world visually, and while it's interesting to view, it doesn't allow enough on the surface or even depth to understand how the \"wrinkles\" operate. While I'm okay with the idea of the children going into a world unlike their own, I found myself asking \"what is anything and why doesn't it click like it should?\" We are told many times on screen that Meg and her brother have great minds, but we never really get to see what makes them so brilliant like the film says they are. There's points when Meg's brother becomes the central focus and he goes from over his years to unexplainably odd and it becomes hard to digest on screen. And as for Oprah playing the witch, it just sounds like Oprah talking like Oprah. Take what you can from that.It's not all bad within the world though. There's enough colorful elements that I could see young children finding enjoyment in the fantasy world. The set pieces have some interesting ideas and surreal moments in visual repetition and ever changing geography.A Wrinkle in Time sadly has too many wrinkles to give it a recommendation, but I wouldn't tell people run away either. It has interesting ideas, but trouble connecting it altogether. Colorful, but maybe too intense to the eye. The heart and soul is very much seen in Ava's work, but I feel the heart wasn't in the right direction.Rating: 5.1 / 10",

In fact, as I write this review right now, the same copy I was given as an 8 year old is on my desk, nice and familiar and reminding me of days long gone. When I heard they were adapting it to a big-budget film with Disney, I was mostly excited, with a few reservations. Here was the chance to see this great story communicated through a new media!However, I went to see the film and was sorely disappointed. To begin with, it didn't start on a dark and stormy night! One of the most iconic lines in literature, and they saved it for after a needless flashback that oversimplified and explained subtleties in the book.Aside from that, the first half was pretty decent. It mostly followed the book, and I liked the characters of Mrs Whatsit, Mrs Who, and Mrs Which. I wasn't expecting to like Mindy or Reese in their roles, but I feel they did a good job. And I did really like Oprah as Mrs Which, which I did have reservations about. I started to have a bad feeling when they landed on Uriel. When Mrs Whatsit shifted into her \"other form\", it looked like a depressing, CGI version of a piece of flying lettuce. Not at all like the majestic Mrs Whatsit on my cover! However, I tried to hold on nonetheless.While there were several little unsettling changes, it all started to veer quite far away from the book the moment they landed on Camazotz. Without going into terrible detail, let's just say that the filmmakers completely missed the point of what the book was originally trying to portray! Entire chapters were left out! Important character development was skipped! And all of Calvin's best scenes in the book were cut, making him some sort of useless tagalong!With all of their skipping, it ruined the original plot and many other good points. To its credit, however, it did have lovely visuals. The other worlds were very beautiful, and while Camazotz was completely inaccurate, it was gorgeous. I also didn't mind the majority of the casting, whether or not I'd agree with it. But, it just lacked the soul and subtlety of the original text.",

            "content": "Before I begin this review, I would just like to say that I don't know how I feel about this film, and I'm not sure I ever will, hence the 5/10 rating. Having read the original source material for A Wrinkle in Time, this is a strange goddamn adaptation, to say the very least. In my eyes, there are a few reasons for this. Firstly, some of the changes it has made to the original source material are baffling, while others actually make sense. For instance, \"Red\" (read: the Man with the Red Eyes, the physical mouthpiece of It (or, according to this film, the It. Why add the \"the\"?) in the original novel) looks like a poor man's Willy Wonka, but quantum entanglement being the mumbo-jumbo Meg's dad uses for tessering instead of a pure wormhole is indeed a well thought-out change. The flowers are a stupid addition (although not altogether pointless to the plot), but the change regarding what Mrs. Whatsit transforms into is rather good. All of what they did to Camazotz did my head in as to whether I liked it or not, including the stairwell sequence, which to me might have well been conceived of on\nSecondly, it is obvious that the message of this film was tweaked a bit to have a bit of commentary regarding womens' body images and how it affects them, as well as empowerment of women, and I am certain there are cries of \"SJW-ism\" and what not in this review section. A film like this attracts those sort of unpleasant reviews like honey does flies. I personally don't know how I feel about it. Ask me Tuesday whether it was garbage and you won't get the same answer Wednesday. I don't even know if I care.\nThirdly, while the performances of the three immortal girls aren't too shabby, the rest of the cast is hit or miss. Storm Reid is alright, but she doesn't get as many lines to work with as I was expecting, oddly enough, being the protagonist and all. Calvin's actor's performance is as interesting as watching a sundial's shadow move. Charles Wallace's actor, Boognish bless him, is trying incredibly hard to nail his character, but falls way short, sadly. Shame, too, as he probably would have been better with better direction.\nTo summarize, I do not know if I recommend this film. Ask Schrodinger's cat instead.",

However, upon leaving the theater, I felt the same lightness and joy I experienced watching Wonder. The film had a deep heart, displaying the power of love and the worth of humans-- and that we can deserve love for being ourselves, rather than constantly striving for approval.A Wrinkle in Time featured charming actors, with Storm Reid stealing the scenes as the persnickety, precocious Meg Murry. Deric McCabe is perfectly cast as the impercetable and brilliant Charles Wallace, while Levi Miller's kind Calvin consistently offers the support Meg needs to save the day. The Mrs.'s, played by Oprah Winfrey, Mindy Kaling, and Reese Witherspoon, are dazzling, beautiful, wise, brave, and unknowable as they guide the children on first a search and then a rescue mission, giving the children the courage and tools to fight the darkness. I read this book in 5th grade and despised the slow classroom pace and the drying of the novel's appeal with homework and questions. As an English teacher, I revisited the book this past Christmas and quickly devoured others in the series, captivated by the flawed, clever fighter who is Meg Murry. I found permission to be a smart, capable woman as well as permission to live with flaws and not constantly try to cover them up in shame. I found a deeper appreciation for the people around me and a desire to reach out and make the world a better place. While a two hour movie does not allow for the depth of development we find in books, this film adaption does good job of opening many of those doors for viewers. Ryan Coogler's praise for director Ava DuVernay is well earned with a fantastic, diverse cast, beautiful scenery, and spot on emotional appeals.

            "content": "While plenty of children's books are imaginative, no amount of CGI can cover up the fact that a faithful adaptation to the source material should be the highest priority. Unfortunately, due to the heavy Christian undertones in the original story, an anti-Christian Hollywood managed to churn out this loose adaptation of A Wrinkle in Time that doesn't do much more than waste a few hours of your time. Sure, there are hints to such important ideas as faith, but they're lost in lackluster character development that tries to \"modernize\" something that has been timeless for decades.Each of the sequences in this film merely seems like an excuse for gorgeous set design. If anything, the alien worlds and settings are neat to look at, but they don't do much to distract from the events that just happen without much explanation as to why, or what purpose they serve. For instance, the scene with the identical houses and families all acting in synchronicity (one of the scenes from the trailer) is visited and exited in a matter of moments, and there was no point or moral lesson to teach there. It just was. Then it was not.Perhaps the most frustrating part of the film was the main characters. When Meg (Storm Reid) was describing all her faults, I had to stop and think: did the movie show us these faults? Some of them were accurate, but most didn't seem to be obvious character flaws that she was trying to overcome, or at least not ones that were presented earlier in the film. Consequently, all the characters felt as flat as a visit to a 2-dimensional world (which, ironically enough, was a scene from the book that didn't make it into the movie).A hollow adaptation with flashy visuals and nothing else, I give A Wrinkle in Time 2.0 stars out of 5.",

I do applaud this but there is so much........Whilst certainly a film the kids may love for me personally it felt too lovey dovey with cherries on top and apple pie with cream on the side, no meat to the story and honestly I just didn't care what happened to who.

That said, it also channeled (and magnified) all the messiness too. A somewhat garbled plot became completely disjointed. The 3 mrs. characters just plain never worked, spending every moment either explaining things or making stale jokes. An ominous evil force became laughably cliche fairly quickly. And most importantly, every single theme was beaten like a dead horse. It felt like a very special episode of \"A Wrinkle in Time.\" I love DuVernay's ambition, but I had hoped for better than the most expensive and well-done after school special of all time.

Said rip-off remains unfinished, unpublished and partially lost and that is probably for the best. The 2003 adaptation of the Wrinkle in Time novel was really good and stayed mostly faithful to the book. And when I first saw advertisements for this adaptation I was really excited. I like all kinds of movies and usually when something comes out that everyone hates, I am one of the few people who would like it. With a couple of movies it was the other way around but that is to be covered in other upcoming reviews (specifically for Cloverfield and the 1996 Romeo and Juliet adaptation). I have yet to write more reviews that reflect my cinematic taste but bottom line it takes a lot for me to dislike a movie.So the fact I am giving this movie a 3 star rating is saying something.I saw this a few days after opening day. 3.8 stars right away? It cannot be THAT bad, I thought. So my stepdad took me to see it. For the rest of the week I could not stop talking about how bad it was. The good visuals, casting, intentions, and beginning do not at all make up for its shameless differences from the book. I am not a big reader but when I see an adaptation of a book I have read, I get annoyed if it is an unfaithful adaptation. This movie is nothing like the book. The book was strange, unique and indescribably beautiful. This was a very modern and watered-down adaptation that almost insults Madeline L'Engle. The 2003 adaptation did change how certain things happened, but the plot remained the same. This adaptation, however, overthinks the adaptation concept by changing the plot.Adaptations are not that hard to make! I mean, I understand that scenes from the source material must be cut out or hastened to keep it from getting to long (this would probably be a 3-4 hour movie if they did not cut at least some parts out) but changing the parts you keep is just annoying and unnecessary. Entire characters cut out or heavily altered. Important plot points were made nothing like the book. If you have not seen this movie, I will warn you are not missing out. I fully agree with the other negative reviews of this movie.Oh and one more thing. In the book Meg has two brothers named Sandy and Dennys. They contributed nothing to the plot so it makes sense that they were cut out. However, the book has about 7 sequels and the third sequel, Many Waters, REVOLVES around Sandy and Dennys. With that, Disney would run into some very serious problems if they decide to make a Many Waters adaptation. But given this film's negative reception, it probably was not going to happen anyway. Bottom line, I recommend the book as much as I do NOT recommend this movie.",

I like Winfrey, Witherspoon, and Kaling in their roles, and Reid and Pine were good as well. But other than that and the effects, the film falls pretty flat. The only moments where I felt truly engaged was when they were exploring the new dazzling lands. Everything was uneven, it wasn't consistent. The enjoyable parts come far and few in between. For an adventure film, it was kinda dull. I would've liked more adventure and more engaging moments. I felt like the characters deserved a better script.The film tried and I can see that, and I really love the diversity shown in the film, that's a beautiful thing.

Looking at the overall IMdB ratings more closely, I see that women voters rate it a full point higher than men do, but even for them the median is 5/10 even after you cut out the trolls who rate anything they see as 1/10.The level this movie seems aimed at, given the simplistic nature of the dialog, seems to be pre-teen, not YA. But the intense, vivid nature of the visuals is such that it might well give nightmares to kids under about 6 -- there are a few quite intense and scary scenes concerning The It (who is, essentially, Satan). There are many good actors in the cast, but they don't have a lot to work with, and the three magic Mrs. (Oprah Winfrey, Reese Witherspoon, Mindy Kaling) are kind of wasted, as is Chris Pine. However, two characters I liked were Storm Reid as the young heroine Meg, and Gugu Mbatha-Raw as her mother. They come across well.There's so much here that doesn't make sense even at a first look. The three kids (Meg, Calvin, Charles Wallace) are strictly told by the three \"Mrs.\" to STAY TOGETHER as they set off on their adventure into mystical lands. What's the first thing they do? You guessed it. Why can't Happy Medium (an entertaining Zach Gallifianakis) say more than a few cryptic hints? Why for that matter can't anyone be more specific? And I actually worry about Meg's situation at school. She's a bullied outcast because her father disappeared and she's fallen into deep depression. Kids who are bullied by mean girls at school shouldn't expect their problems to be solved by three demigods who suddenly appear and whisk them off into the cosmos. They need more than just sympathy: they need to know what to *do* about their problem. This movie doesn't, in the end, give much guidance.",

A lot of kids movies these days try to gear towards adults as well, so, I thought I might enjoy it given the amount of stars in the film, and the remake of Annie could have been painful but I ended up loving it and have seen it 3 times since it's a favorite of my nieces and nephews. I've happily sat through Moana multiple times, even downloaded some songs. Frozen...I can sit through that, but not one of my faves. So, I like kids films. But this was one of the worst films I've seen in awhile. Which is too bad 'cause I remember loving the book as a kid...although I can't say I really remember the book other than there was that flying centaur guy on the cover of the book, so my dislike of the film isn't from sentiment. It's just a bad movie. The positives, which are few, are the women in the film. They all did a great job. It's hard not to like Reese, Mindy and Oprah. And GuGu did a great job even though she wasn't in the film much, which was too bad. Chris Pine is highly likable but I had a hard time believing he's this genius physicist. He has pretty and likable going for him but he doesn't look smarter than a 5th grade science teacher. Although, you could make GuGu the queen of England and I'd probably say it's believable so that's either a credit to her or my fondness of her is clouding my judgement. Other than them the casting was either terrible or not good...with the exception of the kid who played Clint, he was pretty good. The rest of the kids and the teachers, with the exception of one teacher, seemed like they came straight out of John Casablancas or some terrible casting office.It was pretty clear the director had never worked with visual effects, didn't understand them, ran out of money, or all of the above. The first shot you see of the fantasy world looked like New Zealand with a hue adjustment overlay that flattened the whole picture and they didn't bother to cut and separate the pieces into individual mattes. Which makes me think the director blew the money. No one does that. Usually there are painted mattes overlaying a real scene or the whole thing is various mattes, more typically. There were some crappy looking flower mattes over the hue color change. Matte cutting is VFX 101 and even your cheap, straight to video stuff has it. The scene still would have looked surprisingly low budget for a film with all these big stars but I was surprised by how amateur it was. I did some VFX assistant work at Disney and I could have tackled it, which is how basic it was.Some of the scenes were somewhat cool but it was all kind of cheap looking. Reminded me of the low-budget kids films of the '80s. The effects weren't as bad as them, but were compared to what's out there now. I also started to think the director, aside from having no VFX experience also had no fantasy/Sci-fi experience when Reese turned into a giant piece of lettuce and flew the kids around like Falcor the dragon. Which, I guess I wasn't that surprised when the villain, The It, turned out to be just like The Nothing from The Neverending Story.Another thing that made me think the directory ran out of money is how few scenes there are in the real world. School. The house. An alley. That's about it. It happened on the movie Dungeons & Dragons. The guy who owned the rights to the title convinced a producer to give him 35 million. He had zero film experience and the director blew all his money early on on effects 'cause he didn't understand how the process of getting them made works, which is why they usually give these type films to VFX specialists or animators to direct, or to film makers who have a lot of experience with VFX-heavy TV like Game of Thrones.When I looked up who the director was I was surprised but not surprised. Surprised they would give this budget and type of film to someone who's experience is low-budget drama. It said Selma was a 20 million budget but I find that hard to believe. A Quiet Place was 15 and that had aliens and a lot more going on than a film where most of it was MLK Jr. talking around a table or on the phone. Which, again makes me think the director has a budget problem 'cause I can't imagine Selma costing more than 10 million. There's no stars other than a few tiny scenes with Oprah, and even the period piece stuff wasn't enough to put a major dent in a budget.Pretty much the whole film is the characters meandering from one place to the next. There wasn't much of a cohesive plot, other than her father is missing and they're trying to find him. They just did aimless things like have the lettuce creature fly around for no reason, then they suddenly decide they're going to go to see some dude who lives in a cave...why? Not sure. He just said a bunch of meaningless hippie stuff, like, follow your heart or something. That's kind of all that was said to get the girl to where she was going. So, not sure how she even found her father. They just decided at one point she would by wandering around aimlessly with no one actually giving her any guidance. Just great advice like, \"I give you your flaws.\" Literally that's how she defeated the bad guy. Which, didn't really make sense. She defeated the bad guy by saying she loved him. Lame, and not sure how that's a flaw. The girl also uses fuzzy physics to accomplish things, meaning, not real physics. Like, why in the world would they make that part of the plot? It seemed ridiculous that this young girl would grasp complex physics and in reality she didn't, so, not sure how that went unnoticed. I suppose because film people aren't up on their physics but seems like they should have at least asked someone...like from Cal Tech, the school 15 minutes from Disney that is the MIT of the west. Also, why was her father trapped in a box? Why didn't he leave? There were doors on both sides of the box. And why would the father suggest leaving the son? No father would be like, \"Hey, this is hard, let's bail and leave the child I never knew.\" Also, the finale was surprisingly scary for kids. The little girl behind us was crying. Again, I don't think the director understood horror elements and age appropriateness. I've seen a ton of kids movies and this is the only one I've been concerned I was going to get in trouble for taking my niece and nephew to, in case they got nightmares.It's a shame. 100 million is a lot of money to hand over to a director whose experience is a low-budget movie and documentaries. Not sure how that happened. They should have given it to the director of Girls Trip. Not the same type of film, but GT was really well done, had a decent budget, big stars. I understand wanting to give opportunities but the process is typically working your way up, not giving someone more than they can handle, thus endangering the livelihood of others when the film tanks. Obviously, this won't tank Disney, but this is why studios try to be as risk-free as possible, 'cause a 100 million flop, plus marketing costs which sometimes are equal to the film, can shutter the doors of a studio. Oh well. It was good to see Gugu. Hopefully this will open more doors for her even if the film wasn't great.",

Telling the story, the way they knew how to, newcomer Storm Reid who plays Meg in the movie, finds herself as she journeys into a world that is strange and very peculiar. \n I loved this movie and I must give props where props are due to the cast, crew and Ms. DuVernay, they did an incredible job on a book that I have never read or even heard of for that matter. The lyrics to the title track sums up this movie very beautifully, just read these words: \"They hear you when you cry. This love is far and wide. When you smile the stars align.

I admit it, i'm a book purist. I go to a film to see the author's vision, not the director's. thankfully, this started to happen the 2nd half of the film. the movie got more faithful (and darker) halfway through. it's a beautiful movie and i'm glad I saw it in 3d, so that plus a great cast is why I give it a 6, but I don't need to tell you this movie is mostly a screw up.",

A WRINKLE IN TIME contained way too many static scenes showing nearly nothing on the screen, as the characters waxed philosophical with seemingly endless Yakkity-Yakking. Even the recent feature MONSTER TRUCKS contained more consistent action, and came off as much better plotted. Considering that the source material for A WRINKLE IN TIME is alleged to be a children's classic science fiction novel, as well as the fact that this movie was promoted as having an A-List cast, most theater goers surely bought tickets with the expectation that they would be blessed with something more stunning, provocative, and \"snore-proof\" than just something at the level of another NINJA TURTLE offering. But rather than spending the pages necessary to pick apart the plot, performances, dialog, and effects of A WRINKLE IN TIME, perhaps it would be more constructive to focus on the ONE good thing about this exercise in how NOT to win friends, or influence people. That would be the portion of the movie in which--thanks to the Miracle of CGI--America's favorite traffic cop Sasser turns into a flying head of lettuce (though it would be nicer if we'd see more of her as she changes).",

They are brave, intelligent, resolute, and at times goofy or even cruel.The three main characters find themselves in an intergalactic search for a missing father helped along by three very different but benign witches. Acting by all participants is solid. Storm Reid as the main character inhabits her role with just the right mix of seriousness, charm, and intelligence. The mix of music is also perfect with well-chosen songs throughout.200w_d.gif\nMy only real complaint about the movie is its length. It's packed with events and visual splendor but is too short. At times I wanted things to just slow down a bit and explore all the characters more. Maybe that's because I've never read the book. Perhaps children seeing the movie will be less patient than I.You must try to experience the movie from the perspective of a child or an adolescent. The emotions displayed in the film are at times very raw and on the surface: love, regret, fear, doubt, jealousy, anger -- they're all here and viewed from a young perspective.It's a heady emotional mix that occasionally butts heads with the plentiful visual splendors on display. That's quite a directorial accomplishment, in my opinion.Some younger children may find some of the sequences too scary or even nightmarish. But on balance this is a very solid film.The Disney organization should be proud that it has made an investment in such a film. What's also significant is that the film's multi-cultural and multi-racial nature will be unnoticed by many if not most of the young people who see it.",

Well let me tell you that that only left me even more disappointed.From the start of the movie they used some very unrealistic situations, which left the audience feeling more disconnected to the characters than we should have. Along with some horrible character development, I overall disliked about every character in the whole movie. The main character, Meg, was unlikable, emotionless for most of the movie, and a major bore. She did not make for a fantastic heroine. Calvin honestly did not add a single thing to the movie at all. They could have left his character out entirely and the story would not have been effected. The little brother was SOMETIMES cute but mostly just annoying. All of the actors, even the very well known ones were preformed atrociously. How is that even possible?? Every line felt lifeless and forced. I'm a crier but there wasn't a single heartwarming/emotional scene in the whole movie. The whole performance was awfully dry.The costumes were, well cool I guess if you like vegetables and have horrendous sense of style. I personally hated everything about them. The colors of the background were way too vibrant and there was an overwhelming amount CGI. It gave me a major live action Alice and Wonderland vibe, which I really disliked.There were too many plot holes left and I was continuously confused throughout the entire movie. Now it's not unusual for a movie to not explain everything so that it builds the viewers curiosity, but in those movies they normally end up answering your questions. In THIS movie, not only do they not explain what's going on and why, but they continue to pile on more and more plot which just made me more confused.The ending seem way to easy, almost as if there was no challenge for the characters. Now I'm going to be honest and say that I have never read the book, so maybe the movie made more sense to those who read it, but after watching A Wrinkle in Time, I really don't want to read the book.Overall, I would NOT recommend this movie to even your worst enemy.

A vast departure from the beloved children's novel from the 1960s, this effects laden, star-studded adaptation sheds significant character and story elements from the novel to accommodate the aggressive visuals, timely social commentary and its overreaching narrative that strives towards its doubtful sequels.Incidentally, imprisonment on another planet is a good excuse for missed child support payments.

            "content": "When I first saw the trailer I was concerned. I re-read the book in January just to refresh my memory on how this SHOULD go... And it should be noted that the book also has it's flaws, like poor character development and an abrupt ending. I'm seeing lots of complaints that movie-Meg is annoying and one-dimensional, and let me tell you, book-Meg is too. However, there is a pivotal scene in the book in which she learns to stop being petulant and finds her purpose, and this scene DOES NOT EXIST in the movie. I would argue that this one scene that they cut out is crucial to the climax of the story, and this adaptation completely jumps over those events. Therefore the fault of character development is further worsened, but it's worth pointing out that one-dimensional characters in children's books are common, in order to allow the child to imagine themselves as the protagonist.Anyone who's read the book knows that their mother has red hair, and Meg's is a mousy brown. People are so upset by this change. The idea that Meg hates her hair is TRUE TO THE BOOK, and personally, I don't think the texture of the actresses' (mom and Meg) hair are necessary to the storyline. The fact that we chose to make them WOC actually makes MORE sense than what's in the book, in my opinion, because our culture actually SHAMES textured hair whereas brown is just boring. In the same way, Charles Wallace isn't adopted in the book, however I feel it helps to explain his \"oddness\" more effectively because of it. We aren't recreating the world of the 60s, we're telling the story in present day so our children can relate to the characters and not roll their eyes at an out of touch story. These were excellent ways to do this. The book is written in a way where it does not make it relevant as to what era it takes place; that's part of its transcendence. As far as the Misses go, they were obviously hyped in the trailer because they're freaking Oprah, Reese, and Mindy, but their roles are not supposed to be main characters. I'm seeing a lot of complaints that they don't serve enough purpose, but that's kind of the point. Albeit, the way they are utilized in the movie doesn't make as much sense as it does in the book with what they chose to leave out, but overall the three actresses play them the way they are written in the book. Whatsit is young and inexperienced in her role, Who speaks in quotes, and Which is your most wise, guiding figure who is so otherworldly she struggles to materialize. And as far as their races go, who cares? The book doesn't describe their skin. I'm more upset that Whatsit transforms into a Green Giant looking parachute instead of Pegasus-like creature described in the book, but that's mainly because I love horses. It doesn't affect the story.All of this leads me to my final point which is, I don't understand why people think this is so preachy? The entire book is based around the concept of good and evil, love and hate. The \"IT\" is essentially the devil in the book, to the point where references to God are made (they're EXTREMELY random, but they are made). So what if Meg is insecure about natural waves instead of dishwater brown? So what if we made the Misses Indian, Black and White? The only scene that gets preachy is when Oprah's character Ms. Which describes what \"IT\" does to our world, and literally all she says is that evil is the influence causing all terrible things in our world. This isn't incorrect. And the whole point is for Meg to learn her potential as a young girl being the ONLY person who can do what they've set out to do. This movie is neither heavily political OR socially conscious, unless you deliberately choose to single out things which neither positively or negatively affect your characters (like race).Let us please remember that the book was written in the 60s, and won the Newberry for it's radical-for-the-time science fiction plot. No, it wasn't radically socially conscious; most children's books then weren't. But this movie only feels like an agenda if you choose to view the casting in this way. If the whole movie was nothing but white people, it would feel like any other stereotypical \"child discovers their potential and how to boost their self esteem\" story. There's a new one of those out at least once a year. Please calm down.This is either the best nor the worst adaptation of a book. It makes some weird choices that make it fall a little flatter than it would have had they followed the book more closely, but when is that ever not true of an adaptation? If you love the book, it's worth watching, but you'll be a little disappointed if you've recently read it. If you've never read the book, there are lots of things which will make you scratch your head and not understand the direction being taken, but keep in mind that most of it is the author's writing, not the directing or acting. This isn't the most exciting work of sci-fi ever written, but it is the foundation of many that came after it. Let's keep it in perspective, ay?",

Maybe Disney's and Ava DuVernay's politics were a bit too in the face for some people, maybe the hate for Oprah blinded them, maybe there was a Twitter battle that I was not aware of, but this is not a bad movie by any measure. Ava DuVernay is an odd choice to direct this children's fantasy movie, as she seems more interested in politically driven movies than CGI eye candy, but Selma was very well directed so I can see what Disney were thinking when they hired her. Most of the movie is really beautiful, very well shot with great sets and visuals. The only thing that doesn't work (and it doesn't work big time) is the look of the Three Misses, from their costumes to their make-up, all is truly horrendous. I have no idea how such an otherwise beautiful movie made such a mistake. But that is not enough to destroy this movie! It has a nice message, from what I can see it was well adapted from the source material (I can agree with the decision to take the religion out of it), and it was entertaining enough. Unfortunately I have to admit that I found the story a bit generic, the Charles Wallace character was a bit too obnoxious, and this genre is not a favorite of mine, hence the low rating after so many good things to say, but I can still easily recommend it.

The film is visually stunning to look at, but it is no air-headed beauty -- it is full of substance and grace and grounded deeply in the authentic emotions the actors bring so beautifully to their performances. Some people seem to be unreasonably upset that the movie is different than the book in some ways -- but the point of an adaptation is to translate the spirit of the source material, not dictate every moment word for word. It is impossile for an adaptation to be the exact same experience as reading a book -- they are not meant to be. The mediums are meant to be enjoyed for their own distinct merits, and I for one love this film for the way it honors the book while bringing fresh insight and understanding to the story in a visually stunning and emotinally satisfying way. Moreover, I appreciate all of the filmmakers for how their obvious care and attention and love for the source material infuses every scene.I encourage anyone considering watching this movie to do so with an open heart and mind, unburdened by the fear of change and the weight of unrealistic expectations. Allow yourself to be surprised by the journey, and embrace the movie for what it is: a freaking cool adventure flick that just also happens to be a call to be a light in this world by seeing the good in ourselves and others, and to fight the darkeness of negativity, hate, and fear by refusing to give in to them.",

I have not read the book-and am probably not the target audience-but I thought the movie looked great and had a good story about bullying and having family to depend on, although it was a little confusing at times. Storm plays the daughter of Chris, a brilliant man that is working on a new form of space travel. It uses what they call tesseracts, sort of like teleporting from one place to another. One day, Chris disappears and no one has a clue-I guess they weren't paying attention to what he was studying. About 4 years later, Storm gets a visit from Reese, who tells her that she knows how to find Storm's father. Reese is one of a trio, including Mindy and Oprah, and they all have weird names, like Mrs Whatsit, Mrs Who and Mrs Which. The effects are great but sometimes, it gets a little confusing as to what is going on.\nIt's rated \"PG\" for thematic elements and some peril and has a running time of 1 hour & 49 minutes.\nIt's not one that I would buy on DVD but I guess if you are a fan of the book, you might enjoy it more than I did. It would be a good rental, just for the scenery.",

It is not deserving of a weak 4.2 on IMDB and it should be somewhere in the 6 range. The film was a visual spectacle with strong CGI and bright colours. It film itself was basically a Doctor Who style fantasy and is it possibly why I'm not that hostile to the film.However, the film shouldn't have centred itself around a child actor who well, couldn't act and Mindy Kaling was irritating speaking in quotes.",

            "content": "The movie was visually spectacular. Many characters, including all three of the \"Mrs.\" were visually different than the original book. But it worked. They were wild, weird and wonderful.Until we get to Camazotz. In the original book, Camazotz was, in gamer terms, lawful evil. Perfectly controlled, with all individuality wiped out. These were regular people, like us, except that a child who drops a ball is an \"Aberration\" and must be \"Reprocessed\" so that he will never again desire to \"deviate\". IT claimed that it had achieved peace by eliminating all differences.In the movie, Camazotz was chaotic evil. Deserts randomly turned into tornadoes randomly turned into housing developments randomly turned into crowded beaches. It wasn't clear that any of the people were anything but an illusion. The only bit that was done right was the perfect neighborhood with the bouncing balls. Actors were of different skin tones, but were otherwise identical in facial expression, dress, etc. Creepy and very much true to the source material. But then it just folded away like it was all an illusion. Which completely undid the point.In the book, IT forced mindless compliance and called it peace. Meg saved her little brother through the one thing IT couldn't understand (or control): love. \nGiven the number of people (across the political spectrum) who are trying to force orderly compliance, I was really hoping that the movie would do justice to these themes. Instead, it ran more with a trite \"love yourself, love conquers all\" kind of message. Trite and nearly meaningless.The screenwriters evidently missed the point of the book. Too bad. It is an excellent book.",

Also, from there Meg travels by herself back to Camazotz to rescue Charles Wallace, but in the film she is left there by mistake. This fact, along with (2), is important because it's part of her maturation, her learning that the truth, and the ability to fight darkness, is already inside her, inside all of us; but in the film the list of warriors is just part of a lesson from the Ms's. In the book, the Ms's are more Socratic, maieutic, guiding us to recognize truths we already know in another form. This is briefly referenced in the film in a kind of flashback Meg or the children together have when being told about the darkness, and they recognize it in many little petty events in their lives (bullies, adults with conflicts), so the film doesn't get this completely wrong, but is not consistent about the point. (3) is important to the author's vision. I very much sympathize with the intention to make the story more ecumenical, and indeed if I were writing the list it might not include Jesus, or not put him first. But it's not my list, it's L'Engle's, and we should respect that. (4) makes IT too abstract, when the power of the book is to make evil, the darkness, the thing, visible in a variety of weird yet concrete forms, while always reminding us that it, and the fight against it, takes many other concrete forms which we must learn to recognize. (5) similarly makes Camazotz too abstract, and less of a real planet. The ball-bouncing is preceded in the film by a ridiculous scene of tornadoes threatening the children (in the book the danger is not physical but mental/spiritual); and it is followed by an (illusory/dreamlike?) scene on a beach which doesn't capture Camazotz's austerity at all.IMO, the 2003 TV-film version was thematically better; it added a longish illusion/dream sequence at the end which was not in the book, but which stayed closer to the book's messages/themes than the changes in the new one.",

            "content": "A Wrinkle In Time is a children's book by Madeleine L'Engle that blends science-fiction and fantasy. It's also remarkable for featuring a female protagonist with a majority-female supporting cast all the way back in 1962. It follows Meg Murry on a journey across the cosmos to rescue her father. The book's gentle thrills and spiritual themes have made it loved by many, including by myself. It's also quite surreal, dealing in abstracts and ambiguous descriptions. As a result it has long been considered \"unfilmable.\" That word has never stopped filmmakers before though! So, now we get a crack at it directed by Ava DuVernay, with screenplay by Jennifer Lee and Jeff Stockwell. How did they do? Let's take a look and see...A Wrinkle In Time opens with Meg, played by Storm Reid, remembering her father (Chris Pine). He disappeared four years ago, leaving no trace. She's ended up troubled at school, but while people around her have accepted that he's gone, Meg refuses to give up her hope. Her hope is rewarded when her younger brother Charles Wallace (Deric McCabe) brings home a friend. This friend is a woman who calls herself Mrs. Whatsit (Reese Witherspoon). She's joined by Mrs. Who (Mindy Kaling) and Mrs. Which (Oprah Winfrey). She informs the kids that their father is, in fact, alive. But, he will need their help to escape the clutches of a cruel force known as the Darkness. Meg and Charles Wallace thus have to venture out, joined by Meg's friend Calvin (Levi Miller), to save him.So first I want to praise the movie's strengths. Nowhere is it stronger than in the visuals. A Wrinkle in Time boasts delightful scenery, and looks wonderful at every angle. The effects used for the tesseracts - pathways that allow instant travel around the cosmos - look fun and surreal. I found myself especially impressed by the planet Uriel, a utopian garden world with soaring mountains and lush plant life. Between the visual artists, costuming, and make-up, a lot of people deserve to feel proud of their work here...Read the rest at https://www.gouldenbean.com/wrinkle-in-time-review",

The book takes a few chapters to build up to this, which makes the final bit work well, the movies - straight to it with little to no build up.On a positive note, it was well filmed, great costumes and brilliant CGI.

I don't know the lead actress playing the heroine, but she spends the whole movie with one expression - blank staring. The older actresses are all chronically overacting, probably in some attempt to give it life. Even when there is a group of them together it's as if they are delivering lines in an an animation voice studio and they are not actually present or relating to each other. At one point the young brother reappears after being separated and there is zero reaction. The whole film is like that. There are one or two good visual moments, like the sinister children bouncing balls and their Stepford mothers, but otherwise no. It doesn't even have any scientific element to give it some credence.

            "content": "Disney's latest live-action outing is a dimension-traversing trip that centres on troubled 13-year-old Meg (Storm Reid), as she journeys into the unknown to find her scientist father (Chris Pine) who disappeared four years earlier. Joined by her precocious whizz-kid brother Charles Wallace (Deric McCabe) and cute-guy-next-door Calvin (Levi Miller), our headstrong but vulnerable protagonist must confront both evil otherworldly forces and her own life-blocking emotions. Aiming to be accessible for younger audiences, the core message - internal growth is impossible without self-belief - is hardly new, but, despite a completely on-the-nose delivery, it's also effective. The connective tissue isn't always the best (the less time spent thinking about plot machinations the better), though there's no shortage of thrills and wonder, or heart wrenching payoffs, in the numerous high-concept set pieces. There are parts of this movie that are unintentionally silly and a few of director Ava DuVerney's stylistic choices are dubious (over-sized Oprah Winfrey? standard black-tentacle incarnation of 'evil'?), yet enough goodwill is generated elsewhere to forgive these missteps. DuVerney doesn't hide her influences either, family classics such as Avatar and Wizard of Oz are obvious touchstones whilst more adult-leaning masterpieces like 2001: A Space Odyssey and even The Exorcist (\"Charles Wallace is not at home right now\") provide inspiration. Reid is an absolute gem in the lead role too, equally convincing in her self-destructive stubbornness to detach from the world as she is in the gradual shift to valuing her strengths, weaknesses and everything in between. She feels right at home sharing the big screen with Hollywood veterans such as Reese Witherspoon and Oprah Winfrey, who, along with comedian Mindy Kaling, play an amusing trio of peculiar beings that guide our heroes on their trek. Ambitious to a fault, A Wrinkle in Time is a family-friendly fantasy saga that wears its heart on its sleeve whilst delivering a visually wondrous, if occasionally scatty, rollercoaster ride.",

I saw Disney's previous attempt at adapting this book long ago and detested it, but I was open to giving it a new shot (even if I should have been worried that all the promotion of the movie seemed to ignore L'Engle and the story in favor of celebrating DuVernay and Oprah, in hindsight). I knew audiences weren't loving this movie, and it was already disappearing from theaters, but... oof. Some of the most memorable and meaningful bits of the book were chopped. Mrs Who was cheapened with the updated and uninspired quotes she says. And the themes of the book were dramatically cheapened by focusing on the \"believe in urself gurl!!!\" theme so obnoxiously. (Did hear the song for the end credits?) There was a selfless love that was a theme of the book that here is largely replaced with prideful self-love. I was also sad to see Mr Murray didn't get to work with and encourage his daughter on Camazotz in this adaptation. That's so key. It's a strong indication DuVernay was exploiting the source to make the cheap points she wanted to make instead of really understanding and honoring the source. Same for dropping the blind & kind creatures that the book had us meet so memorably. Calvin... ugh. Why did they make him so creepy in the movie?Casting major celebs as the Mrss was a dumb move. Their essential quality was a strangeness. By making them the most familiar faces on screen, that dynamic was inverted. So dumb! And their acting was not so hot. I mean, Oprah did okay. Not Reese or Mindy. The 3D was very unenjoyable. Duh. I only saw it in 3D because that showing fit my schedule. There were a few good moments but overall I am very disappointed indeed.",

I am also not sold to the idea that movies should be rated from 1 to 10, I much prefer the Google way of saying did you like it, yes or no. With that being said, yes, 8 is my honest score for this movie.Now about the actual movie, it is the type of movie where first you are shown the main characters in the real world, some back story, current situation not so great, then something happens that takes them on a journey in a world that obeys to no defined rules and from there just about anything can happen. Movies that are a blend of fantasy, metaphors on good vs evil, a kind of dream-like feel to them , this is one such movie.I'll name a few movies I believe have a similar style/feel than A Wrinkle of Time:\nNeverending Story,\nWhat dream may come,\nWarriors of virtue,\nForbidden Kingdom,\nStardust,\n(Many more I can't think of right now)This movie presents a different view on the universe, it could very well act as the first in a series of many (very unlikely now with the kind of reviews it is getting).It also delivers some powerful messages and metaphors. For example \"nothing travels faster than light except darkness\" is used to show how some people let the bad affect them far more than the good.I also don't believe this is a kid movie at all, despite the visuals. I would not recommend this movie for anyone under 15 years old, and they have to be into that type of movies that take you on ride to show things that might seem overly obvious to some. If you hate at least one of the movies I listed above, this might not be for you.I'll end this here, hoping this kind of review will be useful to at least 1 person.",

            "content": "I thought that this might actually be good. The Last Jedi was great, and was loathed by full time Star Wars stiffs who spend way too much time earnestly debating the economic trade policies from The Phantom Menace. People who actually just love Star Wars love The Last Jedi. Maybe the latest Disney sci fi outing to get trashed by the anti woke parade could still have some juice. I have no relationship to the novel, and I'm also not a racist. I honestly thought I'd have a lot of fun. Let's take a snapshot 40 minutes in to see exactly how insane the start of the story is: three witches unwittingly led by a five year old trick a depressed preteen and her dim witted sidekick into going on an intergalactic rescue mission to save the preteen's dad, Captain Kirk, who got lost in space years earlier (it's the five year old's dad too, but that kid is doing just fine, because he's a genius astronaut and friend to the local homeless community). The kids get transported from their palatial urban backyard to the grassy knoll from the Windows xp desktop. Once there, we ask some floating flowers where dad's gone, once the flowers gesture towards a lake, one of the witches turns into a flying lettuce and the team jump on her back. Let me pause to say, the shapeshifting transition from Mrs Whatsit, queen of drapes to Mrs Whatsit, flying cabbage monster involves flashing three minors, without their consent and over the protest of the confused sidekick (I'm with this guy, Reese Witherspoon is very beautiful but I do not want to see her naked body transform into literally a giant lettuce). This whole thing should have been great, it doesn't get much nuttier than this. But it wasn't good. It was awful. This is humourless, risk-free, cloying awful nonsense. It just accidentally sounds hilarious in summary. How about on mute, does it look cool? No. Remember Avatar, that movie from about 10 years ago? Yeah, if you're going to make a $100 million CGI spectacle maybe spend the money on the nerds on the computers instead of on Oprah. The first 40 minutes of this movie involves schoolyard bullying and assault with a basketball, emotional manipulation of the mentally ill, sexual harassment and digital environments that look like they're covered in thick plastic. It's not a strong opening lineup. If you think that more believing in yourself is what preteens of today need, you are very welcome to continue on this journey to discover exactly that. I'm afraid to say, while my eyes made it to the end, my heart didn't.The moment that I swerved off and rolled into a deep ravine was when I caught myself thinking about one of these witches, Mrs Who. Mrs Who only speaks in quoted aphorisms and monologues from famous writers, quotes she discovered by reading books after she \"evolved past language\". Oh, ok, cool. ALL SPEECH IS QUOTATION. You've evolved past language but didn't do first year literary theory? It's an insult! I'm happy for you to appropriate the bajeezus out of this 50-year-old book to put a couple of black characters in it. But how dare you disrespect those of us with literature or creative writing degrees! You might be mistaken early on for thinking that the last witch, Mrs Which, has the unique superpower to shrink and grow really big. In fact, her remarkable ability is to give emotional speeches that are, 100% substance-free. Once she stops speaking, you realise, hey, what did she just say? It's like someone erased a few seconds from my memory. I remember that speech, starting, but where are we now? And it happens again. You open your eyes and suddenly, you're on the floor, and your kids are rushing over to see why you blacked out. What's happening to me? Mrs Which is so emotionally inert, yet still so covered in sparkles, it's the reason this movie gets two stars instead of one. In an ambitious sci fi fantasy spectacle, I was underprepared for just how glossy, incoherent and so aggressively offenseless A Wrinkle in Time would be.",

            "content": "This movie deserves a much higher rating than the one it has. It's well-directed, all the actors does a great performance, especially the kid playing Charles Wallace. The soundtrack is great and the story is gripping. The worlds were really interesting, especially the dark world. There was something so unsettling about the apparent normalcy. The pacing was good and the message was clear and conveyed beautifully. There was stunning scenery and great CGI.So I honestly don't understand what makes people give it a one star rating. It's not a movie that challenges the viewer or brings anything new to the table, and it's very straightforward and simple, but that doesn't mean it deserves only one star. I've seen boring, nonsensical movies get better ratings than this. I haven't read the books so I can't compare this movie to the books, but honestly I think that's a good thing. Because what makes a good book and what makes a good movie are two very different things. The movie made the story work in it's format and it did it really well. And that's all that matters.Overall a really enjoyable and visually stunning movie that I warmly recommend.Lastly, I just loved the crazy costumes and hairstyles of the three ladies. I'm not sure I've ever seen this many female characters with speaking roles who are interesting and important to the plot in one movie before. Not to mention so many black women. It was really nice to see.",

            "content": "It looks as though Disney is kinda giving up on wasted ideas for a solid kid-friendly movie filled with magic and adventure. However, I wasn't very happy when this adaptation of \"A Wrinkle In Time\" came out. I saw the movie and just a few short minutes, I walked out of the theater. I'm not saying the movie is bad, but it's just so awfully boring as hell. Every time I heard the name \"Christopher Wallace\" so many times, it makes the film very cringe. I knew that somethings wrong with this bland adaptation of an iconic children's classic. This is like a Disney Channel daytime talk show more like a Hallmark Sing-Along birthday card.This was supposed to be my biggest anticipated movie of 2018, but according to me and myself only, I chose to re-watch Black Panther again and again. Awesome time to be a badass Marvel fan. A wrinkle In Time is just not worth my time. Despite the acting good but sometimes cheesey, stunning visual effects, great soundtrack, an undermined forgettable script, and a promising great director (Ava DuVernay) who produced 12 Years A Slave and directed Selma (another Oprah-produced movie), I'm afraid Disney just botched the movie so bad because of all the hype surrounding the film's release. I don't know if this is gonna be a sci-fi adventure fantasy film for kids, another Disney fairytale adaptation, a steampunk sci-fi thriller, maybe it just doesn't know when you're marketing the film correctly and timed it the way every Disney movie should offer.FYI, Oprah Winfrey, Storm Reid, Chris Pine, and Reese Witherspoon are the only good saving grace that I loved and their performances wasn't nearly that bad. Conclusion: Probably I should avoid buying it on Blu-Ray, but my mom still loves Oprah very much. So I'd prefer a rental. Still, A Wrinkle In Time is a total box office bust. It could barely break even, but after I read about the domestic box office here in the States, this is a massive disappointment for the undisputed House That Mickey Built probably write-down on half of it's receipts. Better safe than sorry, Disney.",

Yes, there is here and there some production value, but everything else: gone is the wonder, gone are the charismatic heroes, gone is the suspense, but left is, well, not too much to care about. Disney, like those other big players of the movie business, does not care about the company's products anymore but about gains and profits.

First is because the plot is not so special, as the cinematography and its main story idea. The cinematography is fantastic, thanks to the cinematographer, Tobias A.Schliessler, who was well-known for his work in Beauty and the Beast and Lone Survivor. In this sci-fi movie, the cinematographer is so great, especially when each time the actors are doing tesser thing, that kind of teleportation, to enter the unknown world. I appreciate also for the acting of Reese Whiterspoon, that is always professional and memorable. She is the one!! In this movie, we can see also the newcomers Storm Reid and Deric McCabe, who are funny, energetic, and show their talent on maximum. They are going to be the next superstars!! But this movie still can not reach 7 stars, because the plot is so predictable, not so strong, and gives us the audience wondering, what is the essential of being disappeared and gives risk to his life and family? Well, this movie is about the 4 years disappearance of a father, notable scientist, to the unknown world, but he is trapped there. His children, with the help of magic universe figured by Oprah Winfrey and team, helped them to across the bridge and found him. Because of the lack of the plots, I think this movie can be watched by DVD or just wait in HBO. If the process of this movie had asked JJ Abrams to join to create the plot, maybe this movie would be the greatest movie this year. I hope I can see Reid and McCabe again in SciFi movies, but with more strong plot and more unpredictable ending, because we need more adventure. This world is so stressed, so we need adventure by watching movie.",

I really like the special effects, I think they look terrific throughout.Onto the cast. Storm Reid does a respectable job as Meg, her performance arguably gets better as things progress - which is the opposite to the film overall. Chris Pine is underused in his role, but the casting of Oprah Winfrey, Reese Witherspoon and Mindy Kaling is good - Zach Galifianakis too. I didn't actually find Deric McCabe's character, Charles Wallace, annoying like most seemingly did.Surprised to see that this has a low rating across the board. I've never read the Madeleine L'Engle novel so perhaps that has something to do with it? I do agree the writing isn't necessarily great either.

Yes, many things have changed for the script, but reading the book prior to the movie so I could make an honest judgement made one thing clear.\nThe book is very weak. it doesn't grab me like other books did. nowhere did I feel any depth in it, or any touching feeling. I did have the same with Narnia, don't get me wrong, but there the story for some reason is less depending on coincidental facts to have things happen. It just wishes to be too much and too special.\nThe movie gave me the same feeling and I understood why they made some choices for this adaptation. But seriously, were those the only choices you made? well bad choices were made. It all looks so cheap, so fake, so over the top. The costumes are just really badly made, the visuals look unfinished, the script is just proof of bad writing and even the actors don't seem to enjoy making the film. Reese just comes off as she always does, knowing it all better. Mindy struggles to keep her part up and Oprah, well, she's just Oprah with a wig on. You do want to hug her. she's the only one that you feel love from. But then you just expect her to hand out cars to everyone and she also just doesn't hold up the part well.\nAll in all, this seems to be a bunch of stars having a costumeparty and one of their friends just happens to record it. \nI sat it out, I really did, The book already was a struggle to get through because of the poor writing, but man, how can 1 hour and 40 minutes feel like it cost you your entire weekend and leaves you exhausted.",

The main story is great with great cinematographer, the former cinematographer for Beauty and the Beast, but the plots are quite boring and lack of effects for Sci Fi standard. I can understand maybe the Director would like to deliver a Sci Fi movie with the normal touch, not too much, but this way is failed to impress the audience.

The film was choppy, leaving out many of the important plots and aspects of the novel, including the character development and spirituality. In fact, the movie did a complete 180 with the spirituality that completely left those who are most deeply aware of L'Engle's work completely lost. While I applaud some of the tweaks the director made, such as making the family dynamic more applicable to today's society (interracial, adopted child in family), changing things like Mrs. Whatsit from a Centaurian type of creature into a flying lettuce made no sense. I still don't understand what happened with the character of Mrs. Which, other than to over-emphasize the over-inflated ego of Oprah, the changes just fell flat and made the movie insufferable. The sanitization of the movie by Disney to leave out the importance of the book's meaning spiritually goes to show how it has lost it's touch with reality and deeper meaning behind the works it is trying to recreate for the big screen. Just because it wants to make it seem that there is no such thing as a higher power, doesn't mean that the spiritualness of anything has to be dumped at the door.",

I'm a fan of the book, and like all movies from books, it is different from the book. The movie captures the spirit and heart of the book. This is a children's movie. There are some scary Stepford wives type scenes and a creepy beach scene - and the It is a scary brain that influences thoughts and emotions. There are no intergalactic spaceship fights, no sword battles, very little physical fighting, the fight is for hearts and minds. I would compare it favorably to the Wizard of Oz, and both versions of the Wiz - even though it is not a musical. Has something in common with the first Spy Kids movie that really had the children as the heroes - that one featured a Latino family. Enjoyed seeing it in a theater filled with children and their parents - the children loved it! At the end, everyone clapped! Do something good for your spirit and go see this film!",

Having almost given up hope in life, Meg is visited by three peculiar characters which show her how to travel into space, hoping to find her father and end a powerful force which threatens the universe.It's a movie which at first seems very interesting. It has an interesting premise and brings along a couple of fantastic elements which can make almost everyone shiver in excitement. Unfortunately, the implementation is where almost everything goes wrong with this film. The plot is predictable from the start and does little to change even when close to the end. It's very linear and has, at least as far as I'm concerned, a couple of plot-holes which ruin the little logic that his story has. The characters are pretty underdeveloped and even not very likeable, fact which alienates most empathy. The dialog is so simplistic that it left me feeling on many occasions that it was a movie aimed mostly at primary school audience. To make matters worse, every problem the characters face seems to have a tendency of getting solved/forgotten/forgiven way too slowly. Thus, it doesn't bring any sense of satisfaction as something gets solved.To mention some good aspects about it, I have to tell that the visuals are quite amazing. Every world and place that the characters visit is so impressive, filled with vivid colors and great detail, you cannot help but gaze at it. Also on the plus side, it has some good actors which tend to stand out from time to time but the basics of the movie are too weak for them to help its cause. Oh, and it also has a couple of great songs to back it up from time to time.Overall, I have to say that it was a disappointment. A boring set of events without complexity, a couple of simple characters which don't manage to attract feelings from the viewer and a bad way of solving problems in terms of storytelling, leave an interesting set of fantastic worlds a bit shallow. It's no point in having great visuals if you're not going to tell ca compelling and also interesting story along the way. Too bad...",

Let's start with the positives. Oprah, for what she was in during the movie, she did a good job. Same goes with Chris Pine. The movie was mostly visually stunning and had great costumes and hairstyling. Now let's go into the negatives. The movie was so jumbled around that it couldn't keep a steady plot. Things would just happen out of nowhere and what bugged me was that characters were just fine with it. None of the characters were too surprised with what happened in the movie. The acting wasn't that good either. It's hard with kids so you most of the time shouldn't have the highest expectations. There was this one kid. He played the character Charles Wallace. My god was he horrible. He was by far the worst part of the film. They really needed to work with his character. There were also some stuff in the trailer that weren't in the movie which isn't a good thing in my opinion. There were random pop songs that were placed at totally random parts and weren't needed. The first half of the first act was good, then it started to get worse and worse. The third act of the movie to me wasn't good. It was nothing exciting and didn't catch my attention. I got bored during some parts of the movie. I can't say the movie was absolutely terrible, but I can't say I liked it. It was mainly a Disney cash grab that failed at the box office. If you want to see it, go ahead, but don't expect too much.\nMy Grade: C-",

It's filmed like a scientific drama, but tries to have a sort of magic and cosmos feel and it doesn't work because the visual lacks atmosphere and has a lot of handheld operation. To me, it feels like the director couldn't handle the weight of the project and simply tried to get the shots done in time. The hinting at technical scientific theories is weak and brushed under the carpet, even though it's for kids it still felt weak. Disney has seemed to lost their master filmmakers who were disciplined in all aspects of filmmaking. And if I have to hear the double name \"Charles-Wallace\" one more time I'll go crazy.",

It is this kind of fear that the film challenges us to see and understand before it consumes us.\nThis story is not about skin color, nor sexual anatomy. It is about the power of love and the destruction of fear. The director does an excellent job creating this moral lesson with cinematic vision that both children and adults can appreciate.

But Duverny has no understanding of how to shoot fantasy, at first coming across awkwardly against the urban backdrop and then later in a soulless void of green screen with flat plates of actors and vistas with no grounding or relevance. Wrinkle has a stodgy story with no relatable sense of logic; typically, although cliche, these kinds of fantasy kids films end up portraying the fantasy elements as connected to the grief or fear of the child as they grow up. This film just throws colourful nonsense at us willy billy with no explanation of the logic and no way of connecting to any of it. One imagines that if this were a 2D animated Ghibli film it would be spectacular and appropriate, but like this it ironically seems lifeless and disconnected and pointless.\nIt's twists and turns are predictable and the action is turgid. The way characters meet and the plot moves on are utterly contrived, it's disappointing really.\nIt's not a terrible film, and sometimes with the dramatic elements it can actually be quite stirring and emotional, it's just mostly a film that misses the mark in every department.",

My childhood growing up wasn't that great, so I treasured books that could really transport me on adventures to far away lands, and leave me feeling a sense of magic in this world. This series of books was in my top 2. So you can see how magical and PRECIOUS it is. Madeline L'Engle was a true genius, and I'm not sure that she never actually tessered in her life... but on to the review...\nWith great sadness I have to wonder why Disney felt the need to turn this into a white girls hate the black girl racial thing. With all the hatred in the world right now, we CERTAINLY don't need \"The happiest place on earth\" to be pushing such hurtful issues in HAPPY FAMILY MOVIES! And quite honestly, the choice to change the home from a rural area where they have their wishing rock by a pond - which any of us knows is SO important - to a low rent area where people are getting beaten up and groceries scattered... they ARE scientists right??? And to turn main characters black is not only BEYOND me, it ANGERS me, even after I've had time to think about it. The term cultural appropriation is thrown around all the time when it's against white people, but NEVER when it's against any other race. Why is that? Do you think the African American community would be happy if Soul Food was remade with white folk? Meg, Charles Wallace, the Twins- who were completely forgotten, and their mom were WHITE, and Meg faced white girl problems, and it's WRONG to re - write that, it was important to who she was and thus how she handled the issues! For the record, I am NOT white, I am of the Cree Nation, and you want to talk bad feelings? just saying... There were entire areas of the story that were COMPLETELY left out, entire PLANETS! And those were important in developing the characters! Also, what is up with the UGLY LETTUCE MONSTER, when for DECADES, the symbol on the COVER OF THE BOOK has been the kids on the back of a CENTAUR?!?! Talk about screwing up the story!!!\nThe bright light is all the beautiful use of color, they did SO GOOD! Mandy from the office was AMAZING, I just wanted to hug her! Charles Wallace was darling, and a great little actor! The blond actress was AWFUL on top of the fact her character was written all wrong! Oprah - long live the Diva!!!! The ONLY thing I will say, and this is as a model and one who does makeup tutorials, SEVERAL times they had her eyebrows crooked, and her lipstick was AWFUL! Use Lime Crime or Jeffree Starr to get that sparkle that stays thick!\nAll in all, if it's free, and you've read the book, watch it. Otherwise, AVOID!",

Sadly, we both thought it was awful. I can't fault the actors, this falls entirely on the director. Why on earth do these directors think the stories need to be altered so much? The story was beautiful the way it was written, maybe it should've been updated to make it work with modern times, but not by much.

His role required acting a period of the movie under the evil influence of an intergalactic dark force and he was just superb. 2nd, the lead actor was 14 year old accomplished child actor Storm Reid who played Meg, a new middle schooler who drives the search for her father, a very demanding role that was extremely well acquitted. 3rd, 14 year old Levi Miller playing a neighborhood friend of Meg's called Calvin. Miller is no stranger to stand out performances in leading roles (Pan, Red Dog:True Blue, Better Watch Out, American Exit and Jasper Jones) and he was equally strong in this, cementing his place as one of Hollywood's top teen actors.",

You'll always be aware you're watching Oprah acting. Chris Pine is just tedious and it's not his fault. He just plays a tedious character. He should fire his agent. The lead character, Meg, is just annoying. On top of that, this film is saddled with a story that just gets weirder and weirder, bleaker and bleaker and is burdened with a soundtrack to match - it's excruciating; one of the worst I can remember.

I'm not sure what happened here, but it's just a big mess with few good things in it. So the positives; this film has a wonderful message about self confidence which kids should hear. Oprah was something to behold, she didn't do much but she definitely had an interesting prescense on screen. And Storm Reid did a great job with what she was given, I think she has a bright future. Ok now the bad. This movie makes no sense, and it asks you to just start accepting all this crazy shit happening without earning it. Some things just happen for no reason and they're so bizarre and jarring. The acting from all the others mentioned is either real bad or just too much. Reese Witherspoon is just weird and over the top, and she gets rather annoying real quick. Mindy Kaling did her best with what she was given I suppose, but it wasn't much, and she speaks in quotes, which I guess could be cool if she didn't say who said it right after, and then she just speaks normally halfway through. Levi Miller plays the typical sidekick love interest that's typically given to women, so ok we can let that one slide, but he literally is there for no reason. Even when we're introduced to him, right before the magic stuff starts happening btw, they ask him why he's there and he says he doesn't know, he just felt like he was supposed to, and they never explain that, it's so weird and lazy. Now Deric McCabe...Oh boyI don't want to rag on this kid because he's young and inexperienced so I'm sure his performances will improve, but holy crap this kid got on my nerves. His delivery of this already pretty bad dialogue is just painful. And for some reason he's just aware of all the magic stuff from the beginning and it never explains that. Then they turn him into the bad guy at the end, so now he's trying to deliver this typical villain dialogue with his squeaky childish voice and it just comes across as cringy. All of the other actors do a good job with the very little they had. Overall I really disliked this film and contemplated walking out several times. The only reason I didn't was because I thought it could in some way redeem itself, but it never did. I could see your kids really enjoying this movie, but you shouldn't expect to.",

I can't say I was overly thrilled about watching the film, but I was bored and how bad could it really be? Turns out worse than expected.The story of the movie is supposed to be a feel-good family adventure about the triumphs of good over evil. The plot of the film follows a group of children exploring dream like worlds as they attempt to track down their lost father. All the while they are aided by the fairy tail godlike beings who want to protect the universe from darkness. Unfortunately the film was a narrative mess in every regard. The movie completely dropped the ball in adapting the classic A Wrinkle in Time novel and its subtle complexities.Even describing the basic plot of the movie is a bit difficult largely due to scripting errors. The movie is all over the place and filled with massive plot holes. Its all around very poor writing seems incapable of grabbing the audience. I never once felt compelled to care about the conflicts of the film or any of the characters in the least. I just kept waiting for something interesting to happen.The central conflict never felt grand or epic in any regard which is a shame considering the source material. Despite the beautiful backdrop of the movie the characters all felt like set pieces aimlessly wandering around. There just wasn't a single interesting character in the entire film. With a solid cast of big name actors not one of them brought anything of merit to their roles. They can't really be blamed though for poor writing and directing.A Wrinkle in time is supposed to be a feel-good family adventure about empowerment and the virtues of love and compassion. It's a noble cause to craft a concept around, but at the end of the day this was barely a watchable movie. I really expect better from Disney at this point, particularly when utilizing a beloved childhood classic.So there is one small silver lining which is the animation. The movie had some absolutely beautiful scenes. There were some moments of pure eye candy in the world building. I see where the majority of the budget went to with this box office bomb.At the end of the day not even Oprah with her fairy godmother like appearance could save this movie. While yes it was a shiny film meant for children, there is never an excuse for making a bad movie. The writing was all over the place and it never managed to craft an interesting narrative. It completely ignored the most interesting aspects of the novel. It seems like Disney has at least one bomb a year, this was certainly one of the worst major box office films of 2018.

Can they unite their powers to make the Murry family whole once again?Director Ava DuVernay (Selma 2014) and screenplay writers Jennifer Lee and Jeff Stockwell seem determined to bring novelist Madeleine L'Engle's beloved book, A Wrinkle In Time to the big screen. Unfortunately, the result might best be described as a valiant effort.The good: Child actors Storm Reid and Deric McCabe are adorably well-cast as the Murry kids. The adult actors: Gugu Mbatha-Raw (Mrs. Murry), Winfrey, Witherspoon and Pine take their roles seriously, and I cannot fault their performances. The costumes are sumptuous and the filmography combined with CGI effects is stunning.The bad: The screenplay drags and fails to establish the proper tension required to invigorate the characters' actions. Miraculously, with all it has going for it, Wrinkle falls flat.Wrinkle is not a bad movie for its runtime of 1 hour and 49 minutes, but it actually feels like forever, and it seriously misses the mark in its tepid delivery of such an important and timely message.",

I am still struggling with what exactly happened. Most of the events that occur throughout the film seemed pointless, tacky and annoying. Including the small boy 'Charles Wallace' (played by Deric McCabe), with a voice that will go straight through you, was very awkward at times. Which I put down mainly to the direction.The direction was abismal. Ava DuVernay was able to make even Oprah's role feel uncomfortable. They could have shortened the movie considerably if all the characters didn't feel the need to spend 3 minutes between every word they said and their reaction times.I have no idea what the movie was about. Something about 'Tessersing'? There were scenes that made no sense, people just disappear and pop up a few minutes later with little explanation and if I'm honest, I could have done without the annoying children in it at all. There's one scene where this girl is just looking out of window, it was a bit strange the first time, but when you see her again, it just seems disturbing. Chris Pine who plays the father, 'Mr. Murry' didn't strike the cord. He is intense and again, slow. He should have stayed in the box they found him.I would love to time travel to get the last couple of hours of my life back.

Terrible acting, terrible special effects and it bore no semblance to the novel. Very disappointing. For anyone considering watching this, don't, read the book instead and be entranced.",

This movie felt more like a Disney channel original rather than a theatrical release. The actors were poorly chosen and the script was terribly written. Storm Reid was so absolutely annoying as Meg and I know that Charles Wallace is supposed to be a know-it-all kind of child, but it was very overdone and obnoxious. I found I read the book multiple times and I enjoyed it a lot. This totally dishonored the book. Overall I VERY much disliked this.",

This movie wasn't horrible. The movie has great messages of connection with all, of being yourself and letting your light shine and owning your faults (which may actually be your gifts). I do feel like there was some flat acting in the movie, particularly in some of the beginning sequences, and the beginning was a little slow running for me, but it picked up as the movie moved forward, and there were scenes that were moving enough to have me crying.My 12 year old son loved the movie, and I thought he might pee his pants because he didn't want to take a bathroom break in fear of missing something. I would have loved this movie when I was his age too. This is why I feel the audience for this movie is ages 7-13. The movie seems to deal with situations for this age range (isn't that the age range the book is written for too?).I still liked the movie enough for it to hold my interest, I didn't feel burnt for paying to go see it, especially since my son liked it so much. I also loved the messages the movie had for my son - it was worth the watch just for that.This is a good family film to take the kids to - but don't expect oscar worthy performances.",

(in order to avoid 'suspicions' maybe!? yes, racial issues ARE tricky in America but is the media helping in eliminating them the way they truly could really, or are they worsening it even further? why, for example, America did eventually have an African Black prsident but not a Native one yet? not that i know of at least, has there been one?)dunno if others would agree with me on this but trying to encourage some minority races (again, in the 'police-state' America more than anywhere else, where the topic is 'critical' surely!) into liking science and 'falling' for it when pursuing higher education is in itself a GRAND issue in that country, where, again, education in general and higher education in particular, is not an easy thing for MOST people to begin with, which is due to high expenses and serious financial obstacles such as high-interest bank loans, not to mention 'lack of job security' after graduation, which is also probably the biggest downer for many American young when thinking about becoming a scientist or even a business professional or anything when they daydream about growing up and getting rich!that means no matter what race or minority (or even majority!) group you come from in the US of A, although entering schools is not difficult for anyone, but staying in them (and remaining a 'sane' person too!) is the most difficult, almost impossible part of the deal!that is why America's been so reliant on importing highly educated experts and specialists 'from other planets' rather than producing them 'here on Earth' for a long time now ... (much less to export them 'universally across other galaxies' too!)also, this is certainly a ladies movie i'd say ... director is a female, one of the writers also is, and at least one of the producers too ... not to mention some other females in key positions behind the scenes AS WELL AS in the story: The THREE WHICHes (of Universevil?) are female, the protagonist is a girl, and her scientist mother ... another female 'key figure' there too ...nothing wrong with that of course and i have always loved and strongly supported most female-made art of all kinds my entire boring life post maturity ...but, and again due to the reasons mentioned in previous paragraphs (the rather big and ALARMING shortage of highly specialist DOMESTIC physicians, industrialists, scientists and so on in America thus having to 'purchase' them from other countries) and trying to get minorities (perhaps African Americans more than others?) into, ''Think about it Meg, THAT not so attractive yet very smart teenage gal defending and saving her 'handsome White scientist' ignorant yet loving and hipster father could be YOU! Who knows, maybe a handsome nice White boy will also like you someday just as your White pa did your Black ma, you see!?''but when the proper grounds for breeding such a rare and valuable stock is not only unprepared, but almost entirely ruined and wasted thus unavailable, sending such sublime messages across to the likely candidates is rather like offering them a delicious dessert before the main course and reminding them right away that there's not going to be any meal later anyway, deal with it! (did the current POTUS who's willing to reduce and stop exporting jobs offshore sponsored this movie by any chance? ((NAAAHHH! this movie is pro-Obama openly and for obvious reasons!)) besides, the current POTUS has already sponsored offshore drilling for 'cheap oil' in some nice and clean US places already though, hasn't he?) :Dand those direct hints at cultural and artistic or scientific \"WARRIORS\" by quoting them (who, not surprisingly, come from all nations in the world, well, almost, including America!) as if we're browsing through those cliche' Facebook memes ... and eventually naming them one by one in the end as well (with the exception of many lesser-known yet more influential ones!) doesn't help much really, especially when coming out of the mouth of an overweight business minded super conservative tv and showbiz celebrity figure (and a likely POTUS candidate in the future as well) disguised as a liberal, who happens to be anything but a progressive- or scientific-minded persona really! (just check out her choice of a psychiatrist whot ended up running his own show later!)or maybe that was the idea after all: attracting the attentions of that rather large section of the American society that watches tv all day and night long and loves nearly anything amusing BUT science!?(bringing her giant presence down from the sky and making her look like a normal-size human ((albeit still covered in heavy makeup and fancy expensive dress)) which one of the young actors also confirmed, was a nice touch though! i liked that ...) ;-)long story short, i'm not saying this is a BAD movie; it's actually even worth watching (once only and no more!) and probably the text upon which this movie's been made is a good read after all, but my final conclusion is that it's too mature for the young addresses it was made for (was it?) while also too childish for the mature audience (ignorant 'scientist' parents 'Lost In Space' in particular) who're supposed to like and 'learn' a thing or two from it ...",

            "content": "I picked up a copy of A Wrinkle in Time as a 4th grader in 1984. The book did not resonate with me. For whatever reason, it was not what I had expected and I put the book down for 33 years.At the start of this year I saw that Disney was making A Wrinkle in Time into a movie. I knew it was time to finish the job. I don't like to leave any book I start unfinished, and this was a chance to see if there really was anything interesting in that old book.I ordered a copy from Amazon, and in a few days I was reading it each night to my 11 and 12 year old boys. We finished the book just in time to catch the movie on its release weekend.I think the movie is fantastic.The movie brought the book to vibrant, dazzling life. What was rote back and forth dialogue between a small child and a celestial being, now became a supernatural event that opened up the universe to the earthbound adventurers.Yes there were differences between the book and the movie, but there always are. The changes save time, limit peripheral characters and in the case of the ending, give the movie more emotion and energy than the book's hurried last scene.The movie was made for a modern audience, updating setting, references and language to connect with today's children and adults.What makes the book and the movie great are the themes. Underlying the story are the ideas of perseverance, bravery, trust, family and most important of all, that love wins over fear. The movie captures the movies theme's perfectly, enhancing and amplifying them at just the right time and space.So why was the IMDB rating 3.7 when I looked on Sunday night? It has since climbed to 4.1, but that is still too low for a movie this good. Reading some of the user reviews, it was clear that the haters have come out in droves.Maybe some people simply don't like the movie. Having read the book, I certainly was in a better position to connect with the movie. But given that A Wrinkle in Time focus on interracial parents and their children, cast strong female characters that were part witch, part angel in the case of Oprah Winfrey, an all knowing demi-god, is it any surprise that there are people whose reflexive barriers prevented them from ever giving this children's movie a chance?Despite the overwhelmingly clear message of love, the haters had to lash out...and I know why.You see, the Black Thing has got them. They have been ensnared by IT and Central Intelligence, and they cannot help themselves. They watch a movie that describes the very thing that is the cause of their pain and suffering, along with the anecdote, but they are too blind to see.SPOILER ALERT\nSo I am writing this post to help you, the hater. You need to resist hate and the fear. You need to open your heart. You need to go back into that movie theater and realize you are about to watch a sad and bullied girl go on a journey across the universe to find the father she loves. She will be aided by angels, her future husband and her gifted little brother. She will have to be brave and fight in order to save her little brother from the clutches of evil. In the end she will discover that love conquers fear, and that she is strong and capable.If that doesn't make you happy and bring you joy, then maybe the Black Thing has its claws in you far deeper than any movie can rescue.",

It's a story about family, love, and self empowerment with parts of the original story woven throughout. If you can keep that in mind as you watch this movie, I think you'll enjoy it. I did.\nIt's been a long time since I read the books, but I read all of them (and the related Austins books). As such, I can't remember more than a few scenes from the book, let alone the specific details. But there was enough of the original story \"enfolded\" within the movie that it feels close enough to be easily recognizable.\nIs it a \"perfect\" movie? No. But it's the best adaptation of the books that I've seen yet. Very well done.\nAnd the beautiful visuals are stunning. The acting is (generally) good to great (some of the supporting characters are too one dimensional to be really believable, but they are really only there to serve as instantly recognizable stereotypes anyway). But the leads all mail it.\nThe thing you have to understand is that this movie is loosely based on the book, but it's also it's own story, and it does as very good job telling that story. It's a story about how important love is in a world where hatred, picture perfect consumerism, and general nastiness runs rampant. Maybe if we take the movie's lesson to heart, we won't have to travel to the ends of the universe to figure it out.\nIf you're looking for a positive, visually glorious, slightly perilous (it made my youngest grab for my hand in a few places), and thoroughly entertaining escape for 110 minutes, then this might be a good movie for your to watch.\nBut, if all you want to do is compare it to the book or bash on Oprah, then you won't enjoy this and you'll leave toxic reviews like so many other people have done.

One of my favorite things about the Mrs. Ws is their frumpiness, that manages, for many people, to conceal their brilliant natures. I wish it had been possible to do that in the film. Instead, we had yet another conflation of beauty and goodness. :-(",

These differences lasted a little more than a page. The contrasts ranged from, \"The cast looks different than described in the book.\" to \"Why did they remove and add so many unnecessary scenes?\"The only reason why this review isn't 1 star is because visually, the movie is stunning. Not the best ever, but definitely a lot better than other movies I've seen. However, I wish the budget wasn't spent so much on visuals, and spent more on runtime. The movie begins and ends so quickly, so you never really get to know the characters. I didn't care for anybody, because the scenes were going by too fast to comprehend. If this was someone's first exposure to the 'Wrinkle in Time' series, I think they would feel incredibly underwhelmed.",

I thought the movie caught the spirit of the book, while updating it cleverly.The kid actors were terrific, especially Storm Reid as Meg. A couple of the \"relevant\" jokes (Mrs. Who making hip-hop references) were too cute, but I liked how they linked mean girl culture to self-esteem and then linked that to the spreading darkness of \"It.\" While that is not what L'engle wrote, it is definitely in the spirit of her message.The filmmakers made great use of a smart black girl lead. When \"It\" tempts her with a life where she's popular, the vision includes her having straightened hair. Making Oprah Winfrey, as Mrs. Which, her mentor also underlined this thread. Again, a brilliant way to make the film relevant to 2018 without losing the heart of the story in any way.The movie really needed another 30 minutes in its run-time (and it wasted 12 of what it had with a stupid sequence of \"hey look at me!\" CGI), and needed to work a little harder on selling the physics, but I thought it was solid.",

I have liked Reese Witherspoon in everything I've ever seen her in but her, she is not quirky and adorable the way she's supposed to be (I think?) Mindy Kahling also just floated over her lines without infusing much meaning into them. The boy who played Calvin, and the other adult actors were excellent.

            "content": "The Disney Plus streaming service has introduced me to so many unexpected delights old and new that I would not have otherwise bothered with.This is one such unexpected surprise. In fact, I actually did read the novel a few years ago and I hated the saccharine overly done \"love\" theme and in your face religious aspects (I do enjoy subtle religious underpinnings in movies that give good morals but not when it's in your face). The book had some standout sequences that are memorable but overall it was not a children's book that I liked. To give you context, I adore children fantasy stories such as Tom's Midnight Garden, Moondial, Narnia series, Harry Potter, Dark Materials, etc.But I do love the promotional images of this film, it looks lavish and at least I thought to watch it just to appreciate the visuals. I am one who never ever watch or read something based on other people's opinions. I will decide for myself and I literally judge a book by its cover.One of the many positive stand outs in this film is the surprisingly nuanced performances of all the child stars. Particularly, 9 year old Deric Mcabe who literally stole the show for perhaps a good quarter of the movie's runtime. What a delicious performance, I hope this young child actor is well taken care of, has a happy childhood and not pushed into a career for the sake of wealth. But as long as he wishes to continue on that path, he will have my attention of high anticipation for greatness. The main star, 14 year old Storm Reid was also impressive with some moments of very heart felt nuances. There is no forced acting that one expects with child actors. The adult stalwarts did their part in their accomplished professional ways.But the film itself turned out to be a lovely visual journey with some heartfelt moments of psychological drama and surreal weirdness (something I wish it had delve into further)It has it's plentiful flaws for sure but seeing all those one star ratings is just utter madness. One of those flaws is a certain obvious godliness of Oprah Winfrey's presence that seems a bit unnecessary. I like Oprah, I just don't think it was really needed for her to be so godly! Being the leader would have sufficed.Another criticism I would have is that this could have done with much more humour. Reese Witherspoon's character has some comic relief moments but..just didn't feel enough.What I really appreciated is that unlike the book, this film gives a satisfying complete story. The book had sequels to complete it's main storyline. But as with all movie adaptations, much is cut out and I do feel the stripping down of some of the novel makes the flow of the film rather too haphazard.But the film works for me. It has some memorable sequences and is not anywhere as saccharine as I feared it would be. The journey is disjointed but the performances, visual imagination, Deric Mcabe's show stealing sequence and overall storyline makes up for the shortcomings.I give this a very worthy 7/10.",

All I checked out was the cast and the plot summary. The pace of the movie felt slow. The actors were great on their own (except Calvin which I'll explain later), as well as the visuals but the plot was too cliche and predictable ... which made the movie an overall \"bore\" to watch. \nBut it wasn't that boring though, given a lil thanks to the visuals. That's how I felt anyway, otherwise I would have yawn multiples times throughout the movie; but I didn't.Anyway, good acting came from the star actors, especially lil Charles Wallace (played by Deric McCabe). But one main character felt a bit odd to watch and that is Calvin (played by Levi Miller). Dude looks and sounds like he's high/drugged on some love spell. And I'm not sure if that's intentional or not but I did not feel any emotional depth in character. Like he's just there for the sake of being there. And the plot... ayy, nothing much to say about it other than it being absolutely predictable. Especially with the whole \"there is light in darkness\" concept. So yes, just like most of the folks here have said: \"very poor script\". \nAnd it's such a shame really because I felt there IS potential to bring out that hidden awesomeness in it---I wondered why the advertising for this movie was not that happening.

Like the most laughable line was was the \" Flowers are the best gossipers of the universe line\" which is just as laughable as the first films \" These are glowworms they feed on laughter\" line. The costumes the characters wore in the middle movie were terrible to the point of even looking laughable. They pretty much butchered the characters as they were bland, and weren't anything at all like they were in the book period. They completely got rid of several important plot points like the ixchel part which was important in the book, and the whole movie felt rushed also with some plot points not even making sense to me either.About the only thing I can say that I sorta liked about the movie as I kinda liked what they did with IT, but that's about it; speaking of which they didn't even beat IT either in movie did they? Like they just sorta left it, and to me that's a plot hole as that basically means it's still a threat to earth as they didn't mentioned it died or anything either.Honestly all in all I feel like I wasted money watching this movie, and felt like I should've listened to the reviews on this site instead of seeing it; I don't even consider this movie even good enough to get at a bargain bin because it was so bad.So In a way I kinda recommend the older movie more, but not much as even that movie wasn't that good; however it's still better than this movie by a lot honestly.",

I had heard it was inaccurate to the book and the story was all over the place. But, in the end, I was baffled as to why people hated it.Those that are complaining about the story need to remember that this story IS based off of a book, and it's actually pretty accurate with the exception of some of the scenes in Camazots and the character descriptions such as the medium and the it.The movie had very decent actors, and some of the child actors deserved oscars. For example, Charles-Wallas was probably the best kid actor in the movie and it's more impressive that he's the youngest. He could nail fake-crying and wasn't awkward or quiet.My one problem that costs this movie one star is Calvin. Holy crap did that kid make me want to pull my hair out. I know kids his age who are better actors and probably couldve made it into this movie. I know that he's a character in the book, but he didn't have to be added into the movie, nothing would've changed except the love subplot with Meg would've gone away. The lines that he was given were agonizingly awkward and the way he delivered them was just nails on a chalkboard.My favorite of these lines include:\n\"You have no idea how incredible you are\"\"I like your hair...\"\"I don't know... I just felt... that I had to be here.\"Despite that, watch this movie and form your own opinion. I was pleasantly surprised when I did.",

However, parental guidance may be needed in the final climax of the film. It does get quite creepy and a little sinister. For some older crowds, it will be a snooze-fest And for some, an OK film worth seeing once. Younger kids will like it. Teens will hate it. The film does get weird at times and it seems unsure of itself. Some parts are Life-time channel sap. Others, borderline Burton. Some scenes cringe-worthy. Others pretty cool. If Christopher Nolan had made this film, it would probably have be regarded as a cinematic masterpiece. So, right in the middle. 5 out of 10.",

She said she knew it was going to be bad- and that it was. If Madeline were with us today, I'd be willing to bet she'd really dislike this terrible new version of her fantasy. There are a number of reasons for the truly awful viewing experience this film turns out to be, prime among them the fatal miscasting of almost every character in the book. This is especially true of Charles Wallace and Meg, the main protagonists of the story. Important scenes from the book have been omitted and the film's leaden pacing all but obliterates the suspense that made the novel so memorable. What really sinks A Wrinkle in Time is the fact that the book's sense of wonder, it's raison d'etre, if you will, is missing. Instead, we're subjected to overblown special effects sequences, stunt casting and bad acting. The irony is that the 2003 film that Madeline disliked comes closer to the heart of her story than this stinker.",

One of the some of little problems from the movie was the acting and character development. Although you get development, you don't really care about the characters until later in the movie. The spirits didn't really explain themselves until the middle of the movie. Calvin doesn't get explained a whole lot. And the explanation of how and why Charles Wallas came in contact with Mrs. Whatsit, Mrs. Who, and Mrs. Which is never really explained. Now as far as acting goes, Oprah Winfrey (Mrs. Which) Reese Witherspoon (Mrs. Whatsit) and Mindy Kaling (Mrs. Who) did fantastic. Storm Reid (Meg), Deric McCabe (Charles Wallas), and Chris Pine (Mr. Murray) also did a great job. Levi Miller (Calvin) also did good but didn't express emotion into his character. Overall the acting was great.All in all, this was a good adaptation of a wonderful book. They already made an adaptation prior to this one in 2003. 7/10 Good Movie :)",

            "content": "Going into the theater I was with my seventh grade sister and my boyfriend. We were just finding a way to pass the time by going to the movies and to just hang out because what else do you really do on a Sunday night in the winter. I'm not very critical of movies or actors, I like most films I see even if they are a bit cheesy/cringe worthy and I never really knew what \"bad acting\" looked like, so walking into this I was expecting a mediocre film. I heard good things about the book that was published in 1962, lots of people said it was a classic that everyone adored. The casting also raised the stakes a bit considering Oprah Winfrey, Reese Witherspoon, Mindy Kaling and, one of my favorite actors, Zach Galifianakis were in it. They were also the face of all of the commercials shown for this science fiction film. The first fifteen minutes I was thinking to myself, \"This isn't very good so far, but I'm going to give it some time, I'm sure it will get better!\" Boy was I wrong. The acting and plot may have been some of the worst I have ever seen. Let me take this apart step by step. \n Let's start with the plot. I haven't read the book, but I read a brief synopsis before we went in so that I could have a better understanding. To summarize it, the main character Meg (Storm Reid) and her younger brother Charles Wallace (Deric McCabe) have been left alone with their mother after their scientist father has disappeared for five years. Their father had thought up of a concept called a tesseract. A tesseract is the fifth dimension that can shorten the distances across both time and space therefore, forming a \"wrinkle in time\", hence the name of the movie. The kids, especially Meg, have been dealing with the absence of their father very poorly, affecting their social life and school work. Out of nowhere, (literally with no reason) Mrs. Whatsit (Reese Witherspoon) shows up and starts talking nonsense about their father and his study. After this incident, the kids get involved with two other mysterious astral travelers (Oprah Winfrey and Mindy Kaling). Now this is where it gets messy; the director did a bad job explaining on what was happening and why. One minute the kids and the travelers would be on another planet, and the next they would encounter an \"evil force\". To sum it up, the whole movie was these kids looking for their father with these mysterious travelers and !!SPOILER ALERT!! They find him and they all live happily ever after. The transitions between each part of the movie was unclear and confusing. The director did NOT do a good job.\n Now, I don't know much about acting and I haven't really noticed bad acting before but this movie was the definition of bad acting. The main character, Meg, was honestly terrible. I just remember this one line that she said and it made me cringe so much. Reese Witherspoon, Oprah Winfrey and Mindy Kaling weren't bad at acting but it just seemed like they didn't fit in with this type of movie. I view them as serious actors but this movie is like a joke in my eyes. The script was just not good, at all. The actors would say obvious things that just made you go \"Really? Are you really that dumb?\" I do give the movie some credit for having good actors to star in it to attract attention but that does not mean it was a good movie. \n The one good thing that I will say about this awful movie is that the special effects were pretty cool. It was interesting and was probably the only thing that kept my attention throughout the movie. The whole concept of this movie was good and it has potential, but the way it was approached was just really terrible. I think after all the reviews this movie has gotten, the producers would do many things differently. So, to sum everything up, this is my least favorite movie I have ever seen and I was VERY disappointed. Definitely a WASTE of time. The only reason why I would tell someone to watch this film is for me to discuss the things that were so bad about it with that person. I wish I could wrinkle that time when I was in the theater.",

It's not a bad movie It's just Oprah was too much - too much distracting make-up, too heavy of a custom, just too much. If they were supposedly made of light and guiding and searching for young warriors, Oprah was too heavy and grounded to be light and it left an imbalance between the three. The young actors, Chris, Gugu, Mindy, & Reese did their jobs and were immersed in their characters. Maybe it was me every time Oprah spoke it was just Oprah not her character.

The film relates to the world as one filled with heart, passion, love, beauty, majesty, and angst. It was intense, dramatic, and filled with compassion to an extent in which I've never seen in a film. It was beautifully directed, and the actors more than outdid themselves, they were in fact phenomenal and I'm in fact shocked by the reviews that I've seen posted on here. Let me be the first to tell you that they are dead wrong. I don't take films or their artistry lightly, and by no means are the people downing this film correct in any way. This was by far the best movie I have ever seen in my 25 years on this planet. It had me in tears, laughing out loud, angry, anxious, and full of love to the point where it touched my heart to its very core. I believe that everyone who is interested in a well done and an artistically beautiful film needs to see this one. It will stay with me for the rest of my life, and I would see it 1000 times over, just for the sheer joy it brought to me and my loved ones. It is more than worth it, and you'll walk away from it feeling better than when you'd walked in. Prepare yourself for an amazing ride, and enjoy!",

This movie, however, is so poorly made that had I purchased a ticket to see it in a theater, I would have sued for a refund and pain and suffering. First, the makers of the movie have completely changed the characters, all in an attempt to rid the movie world of those pesky Caucasians who have done so much evil in the world. It wasn't enough that a character named Margaret Murry, a red haired Irish girl is being played by a person who I assume is an islander, or perhaps half black, half white, but they had to change almost every character from the way they were described in the book, to something that satisfied the PC police, but ruined the movie. Then, the acting was horrific, the plot was off by a mile and the FX were something a kid could create on a PC. Anyone who says I am a racist for objecting to the multiculturalism in this movie is brain ded, it has nothing to do with the race of the actors, and everything to do with the book and with the fact that Hollywood is reinventing every movie and story, to punish Caucasians for our existence.

            "content": "\"A Wrinkle in Time\" is a baffling movie experience. It's an ambitious adaptation, and I'll give them credit for trying, but they come nowhere close to pulling it off. The story is a complete mess. There's no rhyme or reason to the events that happen, the places they visit, and the people and things they encounter. I'm sure in the book these things were all developed and explained thoroughly but in the movie it all just comes off as random and nonsensical. One moment they're on some planet riding a space wizard, the next moment they go to another planet to visit another space wizard, then suddenly they are in another place facing an inexplicable hazard that of course they magically overcome, then they're at a beach running into a red-eyed Michael Pena, etc. It's science-fiction/fantasy at its worst, where the story is completely incoherent and all the explanations for what's happening is just 'magic' or 'love' or 'because'.The dialogue is also so artificial, that's just not how people talk to each other, at least not in the modern day setting it's supposed to be set in. And 'Charles Wallace' is an incredibly dumb and annoying name. I find it very hard to believe that at least the sister wouldn't have found a shortened nickname to use. That may sound like a minor nitpick, but considering they say/shout the name about a hundred times during the movie, it just becomes grating to the ears.It's a shame, because there's so much talent involved in the making of this movie. The cast is top notch, although many of the actors are wasted on dumb characters, and even all the younger actors do a very good job, particularly the young girl. It has a talented up-and-coming director. Visually it looks pretty great most of the time and it does some really cool and unique things with the visuals, but visuals alone can't save a movie if they serve no purpose to the story. The one area of the movie I do consistently really like is the score, particularly in those moments that are meant to avoke wonder. It's nothing too revolutionairy, just very well-executed, and I was not surprised to learn from the credits that the composer is the excellent Ramin Djawadi of Game of Thrones and Westworld fame.Overall, this adaptation was a sorry misfire that was unfortunately doomed to fail from the start. Complex science fiction and fantasy stories that deal with complicated matters such as different dimensions and time travelling/bending (of which there is a severe lack in a movie that has the concept of 'time' in its title by the way), simple cannot be accurately translated into a 100 minute movie, mainly aimed at children. It usually either becomes an exposition dump of dry information, or they simply don't bother to properly explain the concepts at all, both of which result in poor story-telling. Maybe in the future, these novels get the elongated television series treatment they deserve, similar to how the upcoming His Dark Materials (2019) tv series will hopefully clear the stain of the horrible 'The Golden Compass' (2007) movie adaptation.",

It didn't have any sense from time to time. And also those kids, exept Charles Wallace were dumb. Like for real dumb. The girl got so many leads on what to do and she wasn't able to figure that out. She went to another world and didn't wanted to start belive that she can do stuff. Her brother who had funny name was the one who understand the world and how it works. But still. SHE DIDN'T GO WITH THE FLOW ! And also i didn't find the reason for the Pan guy ( Calvin ) to be in the movie. He looked like he was high all the time.\nCasting:\nStorm Reid - Meg ( pretty decent job )\nOprah - I know that she has a nice voice and it really suits her character but damn, she had some really bad delivery.\nReese - I don't like this actress so i don't want to talk about her performance\nMindy - Why on earth did they casted her ? It didn't felted like all of these three actresses ( Oprah , Reese and MIndy ) were suitable for these characters. And also i'm againts about changing the race of the characters.\nLevi Miller - Calvin : he tried ( bad script can make you look bad )\nDeric - Charles : good job kid !\nChris Pine : He did the best he can.\nGugu Mbatha-Raw - She was good too.\nOkay. So now the reason why i gave this movie 4 stars. I liked the music and the amazing world it showed to me. But I wanted to see more of that first planet. Or planets like that. And from the dark side perspective it was cool again. The IT reminded me of the upside-down from stranger things. But also felted really bad for the makeup. It was just terrible.

Along the way, they come across a slew of creative characters and eye pleasing visuals. And that's about all the film has to offer. A Wrinkle in Time is not only overly whimsical, but also contains moments that are so awful they're almost laughably bad. One of these scenes involves a gigantic Oprah Whinfrey who plays Mrs.Which, gazing down like a diety at the main characters as they whimsically run through an enchanting island, even though their father's life is on the line. The rest of the film is a series of forcefully enchanting moments that don't exactly propel the story. Sometimes the filmmakers even throw in some modern pop music! It only gets cheesier from there. The film's only saving grace lies in the relationship between Chris Pine and Storm Reid. Both of these actors do a good job conveying a father-daughter relationship through acting alone. Keep in mind I said \"acting\" alone. Toward the end of the film, one of these characters does something very unforgivable that isn't addressed for the remaining of the film. In terms of dramatics storytelling, this ruins the once believable relationship. Aside from some nice visuals, which honestly could have been better considering the film was made under Disney, A Wrinkle in Time is a forgettable and overblown fantasy that is worth skipping over.",

We are all light beings and yes once we see our beauty, the true self, we can break any form of darkness upon us. Darkness can only survive through energy and when we give into it then yes we give darkness power. But in order to weaken darkness we have to ignite our lights through removing the layers of the program that has been placed on us through societal ways.

Charles Wallace was not as developed as I would have liked, but knowing the story, that was OK. (One of those missing scenes where Meg confronts her father and all the ways they try to break CW away from the IT should have been in there...)I will admit that would actually give the movie a 7 or so, but I rated it higher because I fear that MANY of the reviews are racially motivated and thereby bringing the overall score down.

It's like the book as well. One of the reasons this film is so great is it shows young girls that love can be a powerful thing. Storm Reid (who plays Meg) does a fantastic job, giving us a character who is relatable and admirable. Deric McCabe (Charles Wallace) also does a fantastic job. The casting in this film is phenomenal, giving us a fantastic cast and each actor delivers a wonderful performance. I honestly think this film did a great job of adapting the source material.

            "content": "When I heard that Ava Duvernay was making an adaptation of one of my favorite books, I was excited; finally, a great filmmaker can do justice to the story after the TV-movie fiasco. Unfortunately, the studios must have tampered with the adaptation as it isn't a movie directed by a talented director; instead, it is more of a nauseous CGI-induced trainwreck being conducted by unusually drunk circus animals.Before I get my numerous gripes with movie out of my system, I'll at least commend it for casting a black girl as Meg Murry. It was a very brave decision, especially considering that it was a major blockbuster coming from the image-obsessed corporate known as Disney.I also want to state upfront that race has nothing to do with me not liking the film. I'm whiter than snow and thus don't get racist crap thrown at me with the same intensity/frequency that some of my fellow citizens sadly do. I accept that everyone is different, but I judge people based on their character, not their physical differences.\nThis comes from my unique upbringing - I'm autistic and suffer from OCD. I'm extremely sympathetic towards people. I grew up in a multicultural diverse church - Bridgeway Community Church, if you're curious; my father has traveled all over the world and taught me to love all kinds of people for their differences. I'm a social advocate who believes in the Black Lives Matters movement as a stepping stone for much-needed racial conciliation. There's not a racist fragment in my being. I also don't have a vendetta against the director. On the contrary, Ava DuVernay is a great person who has made great contributions to the art of cinema, especially with her wonderful documentary 13th. Rather, I'm just stunned that her latest movie was poorly made studio-processed garbage.The movie's basic composition/mise-en-scene was shockingly most unprofessional; its ugly color schemes made the Transformers movies, aka decomposing roadkill, look attractive by comparison. All the acting performances were horrific, especially with the child actors being the most guilty of making wood look more human. The music comprised of soullessly generic pop hits that it arrived deader than a doornail.Worse of all, the script reeked of corporate pandering. First of all, it censored the book's inherent liberal Christian ideology to the point that it became a name-in-only adaptation. Second, it became a boringly bad-at-motivational cliche fest that not even an innocent child would willingly accept. Third, it got rid of what made the book special, which was making kids think for themselves. Gone with the cool scientific concepts, in with cringeworthy CGI and overblown nonsense that insults basic intelligence.The more I write about this disaster, the more I feel sorry for Ms. DuVernay. She clearly has talent, yet her vision conflicted with the studio's financial priorities; hence, we end up with this cinematic travesty. Worse of all, this movie doesn't work with its prime audience as we don't find the characters relatable like how we do with Madeline L'Engle's timeless book.I watched the movie with my older sister and her two kids- both of whom are in preschool. When the movie ended, my sister was gobsmacked at how awful it was. Her children played with their toys once the movie lost their attention yet they stayed within distance of the dreadful thing. Wanting to know what her children thought of the film, she asked her youngest child if the movie was any good. Barely looking up from his toys, he shook his head and replied with one new vocabulary word: \"No\".",

            "review_title": "Not great, but also not as terrible as they'd let you think",
            "content": "So let's get the good stuff out there: the visuals are pretty great. I loved the costumes of the Mrses, Nobody, and I dug Zach Galifianakis as Happy Balance. I liked the diversity of the cast, as it didn't seem to make much a difference either way, which is refreshing. I thought much of the cinematography was well done and quite beautiful. Now for the faults: like most people who have seen this film, the plot is severely lacking. I understand that they're going to find Meg's father, but that is clearly the McGuffin here. Though it's role as the McGuffin is largely undercut by the fact that Meg's father's disappearance is supposed to be the foundation for her despair; so the fact that her search for her father doesn't really matter much means that when they do find him, I don't particularly care. I mean, sure, the reunion itself is emotional, but as far as what it means for Meg as a whole person, it doesn't seem to matter at the bottom line. And I think that's a lot of the problem with this movie-much of the emotion is forced and hollow, with the film telling you how you should feel rather than allowing you to feel it. For example, Calvin just suddenly appears on the street with Meg and Charles Wallace and just stares at Meg and compliments her hair. It's incredibly awkward. I also don't understand why Meg is so important. It's made clear that she's smart, like her parents, but not an oddball savant like Charles Wallace. Yet the Mrses (Mrs. Which, specifically) is convinced that only Meg can save the universe from the Darkness. But why? And besides, if the Darkness is pure evil, why is it not a more powerful force? Why is there no dark, tentacle cloud over Earth? Why does it just manifest as jealousy or abuse in humans? I'm sure this is probably explained in the book, but to be frank, I don't remember much about the book when my fifth grade class read it. There are a lot of questions about the universe that are glossed over or brushed aside and it weakens the movie as a whole. So aside from convoluted story and plot (which I can put squarely on the shoulders of the screenwriters) the pacing also feels off. We spent a good 15 minutes of run time on a flower planet, that while quite pretty, doesn't lead us to much, other than Mrs. Whatsit deciding they need to see a Seer (Happy Balance) to find their father. Why not do this in the first place? They waisted 15 minutes of the movie on a flight sequence that had very little to do with the plot or story at the end of the day. And it's instances like this that make the 1hr, 49min run time feel heavily bloated. I sat through Wall-E (slightly over 2hrs) and the time flew by. By the time Meg finally has her Boss Battle with IT, I was ready to head out. They spend the first 45mins of the movie setting up the characters, but none of it feels particularly necessary. If Act I had been shortened into 20 minutes, it would have left more time for them to explore more of the Universe on the way to finding Meg and Charles Wallace's father. Or they could have just cut it down by 20mins and have been fine. I have to say, people are railing on this movie, and it's really NOT that bad. It's pretty heavy subject matter for kids (some pretty heady ideas being tossed around) but if you think your kid will sit through it, then I think it's worth a watch. I wouldn't spend $15 on it, but $5-$8 sure. I also have to say, hating on the acting is a bit unfair. For the Mrses, Nobody, and Happy Balance, they are beings who are choosing human forms so that the kids can relate to them. They can be whatever they want to be. To expect them to be emotionally human as well is unfair, thus I believe that the irritation one might feel with the acting stems from that. I'm of the opinion that it was a directorial choice and should be noted as such. In conclusion: an OK movie. Not great, but not the worst movie I've ever seen.",

Plus, it's directed by a badass black female director, stars a mixed race teenage girl, an adopted kid, a biracial couple, and an eye candy teen boy who plays the useless tagalong that girls usually have to play in movies. Oprah basically plays herself, Reese Witherspoon also pretty much plays herself, and Mindy Kaling kind of plays a kindly stoned human Wikipedia that only speaks in quotes. But probably the best performance from this movie is Chris Pine. Sir, we do not deserve you. I think it's also important to remember that this book was freaking weird. So the movie is weird. And I think Ava did a great job translating it to screen. It's definitely a kids movie and has a simple message and a fairly paint by numbers plot line. But you'll probably have a good time and it will probably make you feel nice. So yeah, I recommend it.

Mindy Kaling did so much amazing background acting, just with her face, and Oprah... well, who couldn't use a pep talk from Oprah on why you should love yourself? Love is the message, and you aren't beaten over the head with it. Love for yourself, love for your family, be a positive force in the universe because darkness is everywhere.You can choose to do and be better.

Not only were they so far off Madeline L'Engle's book that it bore very little resemblance to her phenomenal story, but the acting was atrocious, the dialogue sounded completely scripted, and the characters were all wrong and entirely unbelievable. I felt like I was watching a low-budget made-for-TV movie. The only thing this movie has going for it is the special effects, but what are effects without a believable story?? Don't waste your time!! This movie is a disgrace to Walt Disney's name, and he'd probably roll over in his grave if he knew such a piece of garbage was created under his umbrella.",

The movie deserves some good stuff not bad. I understand that yall don't understand the film. But give it a watch and yalls opinions may change. But if you dont like it still, then this film may not be for you. No need to ruin the movie for everybody else by spilling out your harsh opinions about the film. Anyways here's my opinions:\nThe story of course i admit is a little weak but its a great story. And it gets better as the film progresses.The music is amazing that it matches with the film very well.The casts could do a little better work on their lines but they seem to do a good job.The tesseracting is very satisfying or terrifying depend on age of the child or adult that watches it.The other planets scenes are either beautiful or terrifying but has a great view for fans to watch.",

The multicultural casting was a welcome change and was the only remnant of the original's spirit. When I was a hearing-impaired fat misfit 4th grader, the book made me feel that it was OK to be different, and that bullies and adults in authority were not always right. Camazotz is a totalitarian planet. Maybe the Cold War has gone away, but the threat of being enslaved by evil because of passivity and conformity has not. The kids in the book walk face IT together (they are not thrown in by a special effect dirt cyclone) and it's an astoundingly brave thing to do--but it's preceded by another brave act: the little boy who dares to bounce his ball out of rhythm, and who they later see being tortured into compliance. Meg goes up against these forces and wins, not because \"Love is the key to everything\" but because she stubbornly refuses to believe the poison spewed by IT. She refuses to submit to the idea that she is unlovable. Mrs. Whatsit says \"You have something that IT does not.\" She discovers that she has love. Sigh. Maybe someday they'll get this story filmed right. In the meantime, if you have a kid, do them a favor: buy them the book.",

We both agree that halfway into watching the movie, we stopped to read the reviews. The reviews were very entertaining.From my daughter: Goodness gracious, what an abomination this is!! I never want to see this monstrosity again. The only thing I have to say that's actually entertaining is the part where Mrs. Whatsit transforms and into a flying lettuce, which by the way doesn't even happen in the book.\nWe had more fun reading the reviews than actually watching the movie. I feel like I'd rather watch Sharknado 3000 times than watch this once again, even though I'm too young to watch Sharknado.

I absolutely adore all of the actors in this film - unfortunately most of their appearances were a major letdown to what could have been.

Kinda. Actually, they don't really help much at all. And for some reason they're joined by a boy from school that she doesn't seem to know very well. He does nothing. Mostly stand around watching her do stuff.After the movie ended I had SO many questions. Where did they go? Another planet? Another Universe? Another time? How did they get there? Something to do with frequencies apparently. Where did the women come from? The same universe her father was in? Apparently the women somehow help people, I guess. Kinda. Why did the women wait so long to help her?There's lots of visual candy and little kids will probably like that. But there's lots of nothing as well. Also lots of vague warnings and such and confusing things that are never explained and nobody seems to care. They say things like \"where are we?\" \"Were on such and such. \"OK\". No, it's not OK. Where is that? Is it a planet? Is it in our galaxy? Universe? We'll never know.The performances are pretty bland. Chris Pine and Reese Witherspoon seem to be going a bit overboard to make up for everyone else just standing around talking.It was hard to really care about these characters. The movie wanted you to care about them without really giving you a reason to.I haven't read the books, so hopefully they explain things better than this movie did and if you've read them it makes more sense.Oh. And one last thing. I'm sick and tired of people making up definitions of what a tesseract is. No, a tesseract is not whatever they said it was in this movie.",

But most kids - of any age - are going to be bored out of their minds, and their parents are not likely to be any more engaged.One or two good lines (Zach Galifianakis's \"Thank you. Earth tones\" in reply to a compliment on his outfit comes to mind); the three leading ladies (\"The Misses\") all can be good, but not with these bad parts; the diversity of the cast was unusual, and commendable, and I liked it; the leading kids were all decent actors and nice to look at without being obviously just \"eye candy\".

If you are looking for a story about a hero that takes on not only outer darkness but her inner darkness as well to find whether or not she is a hero, you will enjoy this film. It may not be an academy winner but for what it is, it is inspiring and heart-warming.My one complaint has to do with music choices which I feel will date this film which is a shame because the story is a classic.

It contains fascinating ideas and imagery.\nThis 2018 version of the movie is a contrived propaganda-laden movie, very loosely based on the novel (almost not anything like the novel at all). The cast was carefully selected to be multiracial to the point of ridiculousness. The only two white women in the movie are also the only two mean women... hmmmm... what are we trying to say here? \nI like both Meg's, but the 2018 Meg looks nothing like either of her casted parents - even though I think she is completely adorable. Other than Meg's adorability, the movie seems poorly directed. The costumes are outlandishly distracting, to the point where I spent most of the movie wondering why Oprah Winfrey was covered in so much glitter and so many gems to the point that she looked like a sparkly amazon warrior. Later, I discovered that her make up artist was trying to go for a \"wispy\" look - complete fail.I recommend you avoid this monstrosity of a movie altogether (unless you just can't stand to not stare at a bad accident), and instead - if you really want to immerse yourself in the movie version of \"A Wrinkle in Time,\" watch the original 2003 version of the movie (I found it on amazon).",

This film proves the power of diversity these days: multi-racial cast; female author and female director.

This film has none of these.It's all way too CGI and the costumes are OTT.Last but not least, the name 'Charles Wallace' is said so many times, a drinking game based upon its utterance could claim thousands of lives alongside the theft of thousands of hours.Save yourself.

The reason I give it a lukewarm 5/10 is because of a key failure in the story.\nThe key message of the film is taken direct from the book: the power of love and family. It's a message everyone can agree on. But the story inexplicably fails to honor the theme in ways that lost the plot for me.\nOne of the key instructions for the children from the Weird Sisters was to stay together. The kids are on their own in the realm of evil and it's good advice, but the first thing that happens is they split up. Not only do Meg and Calvin lose young Charles Wallace, they don't even seem to notice he's gone. When he suddenly reappears with no explanation they don't even seem surprised.\nIt's a poorly constructed scene that broke the spell, but it wasn't unique. The people that they love suddenly disappear and no one seems to notice. They suddenly reappear and everyone just blithely trudges onward. It really undermines the story and the message.\nThat said, there is still plenty to enjoy. Read the book to get a measure of how much better it could have been.",

And you can stop reading my review and switch to another review, so that I wouldn't be wasting ur time.But if you are on an Awakening path, this one is for you. This movie is like a manual / a tutorial about our universe n energy and everything in life for generations to come and that's why I like it. I am a Lightworker and so are many. I don't usually see Disney movies but this Wrinkle in Time caught my eye when I heard Oprah's talk about Manifestations on an interview session of this movie. The interviewer in that session herself mentioned that this movie has awakening messages all over. Plus Oprah herself is wide Awake. So I wanted to see it.This movie has all you need to know about healing your wounds by facing them to see the light beyond fear and darkness (that are mere illusions to keep u in the dark). It also hints on the concept of oneness which is true and beautifully scripted. I liked this movie, a lot! It resonated with my awakened being to a T. It's literally the tutorial for life for the young ones and generations to come. This is an Awakening movie. And just keep your eyes on the lookout: this movie is soon going to see its daylight in the coming years as this mass awakening on earth is already happening and at a rapid pace. People are seeing the world with their third eye and getting out of the Matrix fast. This is The Movie for our current young ones and our future generations.Thanks Oprah, Reese, Mandy and Chris for being a part of it. This movie explains the Awakening process to the young ones beautifully.",

The movie did not disappoint. While many have complained that it is different than the book - of course it is! But it doesn't matter. It was still incredible for so many reasons.First, the cinematography was stunning. Absolutely breathtaking. The costumes, the colors, the scenery...it was all perfect.Second, it was so incredible to take my son to a movie with such a diverse cast. I admired seeing such strong female characters of different backgrounds in one movie.Third, the messages in this movie struck such a personal tone. Watching, I felt like I was ripped apart and put back together by the wise words of Mrs. Who, Mrs .Which, and Mrs. Whatsit. We've all felt those dark times in our lives and this movie really made me think about who we are in the universe.Ava Duvernay did a wonderful job. I plan on watching this over and over again, especially on those days that are touched by IT.",

Of coarse, I love the imagination shown in the wardrobe and set design. The story was easy to follow on a young adult level. The messages/life revelations were all positive.\nParents need to look at the movie trailers more to realize that just because Disney was part of the movie's production companies, this is not a story for children, oh say under 8 or so. It will not hold their attention, of course this is strictly my opinion.",

The special effects, locations and sets are gorgeous, the acting, while not seamless, is done very well by the kids in the film. But what sets it apart is why you should go and see it, like, NOW: it's based on a novel about girls' empowerment written over 50 years ago, it's directed by the first (yes! first!) African-American woman to direct a major-motion picture in Hollywood, there's a mixed-race family, a strong, scientist Mom, and a strong and smart girl hero. From what I can see, many of the reviews here (and on IMDB, etc.) seem to be thinly veiled and coded warnings to viewers about precisely those issues...many of the negative reviews are from the same people who gave all of the Harry Potter movies 10 stars, despite those movies' serious flaws. All the more reason to get your family down to the theater. Go see what real women do...and what real girls can do when they grow up. (Hint: they can save the world!)",

It is imagination inspiring. \nThe cast of characters have excellent actors behind them. The cinematography is fabulous. The wardrobe is beautiful. The idea behind this is thought provoking. The end gets a little much for a child under the age of 6-7. That's why I say it best suited for that age and up. Will you be disappointed if you expect it go rigidly by the book? Absolutely. \nBe open-minded. \nI think the negative reviews are the alt-right who spammed this to try to hit Oprah and this movie because it is pushing hard. \nSee past this. See this movie.

Second major issue was the acting, the worst had to be Oprah. I felt like I was watching a Christmas Pantomime in some nondescript English town at Christmas. Third, the story telling was terrible, considering this was Disney I am flabbergasted they let it go to production. Lastly, the end scenes where pretty dark, how did these make it in to this film?!

Storm Reid is great as Meg, Reese, Mindy and Orpah as great as the Misses too.

It's one of those films you are just waiting...and waiting..and waiting for the story line to take off and suddenly you realize you are 1/2 half way through the film and this is it...as good as it's going to get. For me the biggest disappoint was the special effects. Being a Disney film (budget) I expected \"Avatar\" like special effects and except for one flying scene the rest of the movie looked like it was filmed in someone's living room with cheesy backgrounds. I think this is why people think the acting is bad, it's not, it's cheesy at times because of the script and the movie is not very believable because it looks so cheaply put together.

It's not a blockbuster, but the acting is OK. The script and the roles are good also. It is not a masterpiece, not an Oscar winning, but it is worth watching it, especially by those who are really interested in these subjects, in quantum physics and time travelling and all.I never read the said book that this movie was made from, which it entitles me to write this review with a fresh eye, I should say. But one thing I have to say regarding this is that a movie made from a book doesn't have to be totally loyal to that book, but should invite you to read the book. They are alike, but also different, but that point is that it helps the book come out even more.When it comes to this movie, each scene takes you really quick from one place to another, from one aspect of the subject matter to the other and the action is pretty fast, I should say. One needs to pay close attention to what is happening, otherwise would miss the whole point.Overall, I give it a ten because of the subject and the symbolically artistical way in which is portrayed in this movie. And I also want to balance the other bad ratings it has received so far, to make it a bit more worth watching.So, be careful! This movie is not for everyone, but for those who are really into searching about this matter.",

So many moments throughout the movie were clearly THIS IS OPRAH BEING OPRAH moments (or insert whoever else's name instead of Oprah). The entirety of Zach Galafianakis' role was the aforementioned strategy, with a little feeling thrown in so he can get better roles later. Basically, the character development was non-existent so we are left with a lot of actors being actors.The storyline itself was a strange combination of mind numbingly slow and lightening quick. It was a far cry from the book (I'm not a book purist by any means but if you're going to veer, do it well). The screenwriters even seemed to go so far as to write in completely foreign scenes that did nothing to further the story. They exerted a lot of effort to come up with random mediocre scenes. I gave the movie 3 stars, solely because I applaud their ability create a diverse cast and challenge my personal preconceived idea of who the characters were.

But hating on this movie simply because it changed some details misses the bigger picture and fails to acknowledge the importance of the spirit of the book over strict adherence to the plot.First of all, the focus of the movie shifts from the relationship between Meg and Charles Wallace to Meg's journey of self discovery. I think this was a great shift, because I believe the book paints a very dated picture of what sibling relationships are like. I think the movie successfully communicates how deeply Charles Wallace and Meg care for each other while simultaneously showing Meg building self esteem and discovering who she is, and finding worth in that identity. Storm Reid was PHENOMENAL.Next, the ending. Oh god how grateful I am that they changed the ending. I was SO disappointed by that BS \"power of love\" and then it's over ending in the book! In the film, it felt more genuine and immediate-it felt like a fight for their lives. Yes, Meg does still save Charles Wallace with her love, but it's not that easy. It's intertwined with a discovery of love for herself as well as fighting for Charles Wallace.All I have to say about the Mrses is that they where phenomenal, and keep an ear out for a Hamilton reference at the end! Okay, and yes, they changed a lot. They took out the Aunt Beast scene. But was it that important of a scene? Personally I found Meg intolerable at this part of the book, and all they did on that planet was regroup and send Meg to get Charles Wallace. They folded the rescue of Charles Wallace into Meg refusing to tesser without him, and even set up the power of her will earlier in the movie. They also changed the nature of Camazot. Instead of a machine-like city with quotas and statistics and the highest rate of simultaneous actions, it was more a changing planet designed to trap them. At first I balked at this change, but the more I thought about it, the more I realized that the industrial setting from the book didn't really fit the atmosphere of this movie. Now, I'm not saying this movie was perfect. My biggest complaint was how they downplayed Charles Wallace's intelligence. He never even tried to fight the man with red eyes. He just immediately succumbed. I don't think they did a good job of communicating how special and gifted Charles Wallace is, and I get that they did that for Meg's character, but I wish they hadn't done it SO much.There's more I could say, but these are the main points I wanted to make. Please go into this movie with an open mind and heart. Please remember that this book was published in 1962 and it NEEDED updating for modern audiences. Please give it a fair chance!",

I thought it was lovely. The first half hour won me over and had me in tears. Like the Lord of the Rings, another favorite, the movie-makers decided to take out some things and add some new things. It's difficult to make a movie out of beautiful writing alone (such as any movie based on a Jane Austen novel - the more successful ones add more suspense and intrigue). And so, more action scenes were added (there are no real action scenes in the book). I'm no judge of acting. I just know what I like. I did miss Aunt Beast - I thought that section was important to the story because it made clear that Mr. Murray did not desert Charles Wallace, and it explained why it had to be Meg who needed to save him. I missed the earth-like feeling of Camizotz too, because it is a part that always gives me a strange surreal feeling when I read it - this is one of the places where they decided to add more special effects and action. I can't argue with that, and I thought \"It\" was done in a very interesting way. I loved the paper analogy to love folded over and hidden, and how it was carried through the story though it wasn't in the book - this is an interpretation, a useful device, that made it clear that love was the power that fought the darkness, and was the power that Meg had.",

This isn't my favorite movie, but it is pretty close.\nThe costumes were super good, and I loveeeeeed the various hairstyles. It was nice to see a family with curly hair (majority of black and biracial people have curly hair), because straight hair has been the norm until now. It was nice to see actors being able to show a bit of themselves in their characters.\nIt was also cool to see how far we have come with animations.",

It's considered a YA book, but I've read it numerous times over the years and still love it and its message. Those ideas and images certainly would be very difficult to capture in a film and this one, as many others have said, is a real misfire. Storm Reid seemed to be sleepwalking; the same with most of the other actors. While the book was published in 1962 and contained that time's sensibility, it is erudite and also charming. The updated, PC flavor/characters in this depiction was sometimes laughable and even embarrassing. And that black thing is just \"IT,\" not \"The IT.\"",

I had heard from my friends that it was bad, and I thought it wasn't going to be worth my time (hence the 3/10 imdb rating). And oh man - I was right!The film starts out - - - wait - I can't even remember. I'm not joking - I literally cannot remember how this movie started!There were some things about this movie that I did actually enjoy. Being a cinematographer myself, I try to look out for films that go above and beyond, and are creative in this field. And this film didn't disappoint. I really enjoyed most of the shots. I thought they expressed a good visual metaphor, that looked good on screen.I also liked the costumes and makeup. I know there probably won't be any oscar buzz around these categories, but I thought they were very well done, and got the message across.Now, lets get into the---other things about this movie. Although in some scenes good, I thought the visual effects in this film were surpassingly mediocre. I mean - It's not 'Justice League' bad, but there were times were the amateur-ness distracted from the story.I also think the acting was also very amateur. Now - I love Opra. She's great. But there was something about this performance which really made me wonder - 'Wait - that's OPRA??!!? Wasn't she a good actor once?' Storm Reid was OK. I think she has a lot of potential - and this movie just wasn't her time to show it. I HATED Calvin. I thought he was a totally unrealistic portrayed teenager that does not and will never exist in the world of teenagers.Now, this review has already gone way to long. But there is one last subject in which I would like to touch on. That's the screenplay. WOW. I had no Idea I screenplay could be this bad. I mean - this is almost 'The Room' bad. I haven't read the book, but my friends who have, have told me that a 30 page-longer section (THE CLIMAX) was entirely left out of the movie. I thought the dialogue in most places was cheesy, awkward - and just flat out WEIRD. NOBODY Meg or Calvin's age would EVER say these lines. I almost feel bad for all these actors. ALL of them have great potential, but they were submerged to a terrible screenplay, and that's why I think 'A Wrinkle In Time' is such a bad movie.",

Children being dragged down dark hallways, screaming and clawing for their lives against the forces/grip of pure evil, robotic stepford wives/children in painful sycronization, immersion in dark underworlds with unrelenting devil voices, agonizing sound effects and endless references to patricide, kidnapping etc, a young child possessed by an evil spirit, speaking hurtful, scathing words.....it not darker and darker. 1/2 way through we couldn't take anymore, but didn't want to leave because we didn't want our kids stuck with the trauma of such sickening, psychologically bent visuals in their head before bed. We decided to wait till the inevitable lightening of the plot, but it just kept descending into darker territory. My kids have seen movie rates well beyond their years (6 and 8 years old). This made the scariest movie look like Mr Roger's. They are resilient, tough cookies, but were screaming all eve in their sleep (never in 6 and 8 years has that happened before). None of us slept a wink. Needless to say, when it became so disturbing that my dad and I could literally take it no longer, we left. Nonrefundable was permitted. 50$ put, an eve wasted, heads full of terror. Wow. They should use this movie for torture tactics. It is beyond the beyond. WORST MOVIE EVER.",

Actors are not that bad, Just badly directed.And now the Cons.\n1. (Excuse #3) The Acting isn't that good. Especially Charles Wallace. He was probably the worst actor in the film.\n2. Too. Many. Plot-holes.\n3. Some of the characters in the beginning are pretty awful, but useless in the next acts.\n4. Dialogue just doesn't stick.\n5. Some Unnecessary Filler either mildly emotional or useless.\nAnd, 6. This movie can only usually appeal to a younger demographic. Instead of a wide variety of viewers.And there you have it. A sort-of brief review about A Wrinkle in Time (2018). Now, Should you watch it? If you liked the book, maybe. If you liked the first movie in 2004, also maybe.

            "content": "I read the book a long time ago as a child, and then again as a teen, then again as an adult, and again as an older adult. It has always stuck with me and is a favorite of mine. It's a feel-good book, with classic elements of Light vs Dark, Good vs Evil, etc. It relates to kids who are feeling bullied or worn down by social problems, awkwardness in the teens, adults who make mistakes, and feels like a very empowering book to young adults who just want to have an adventure, and fight the good fight on their own.The movie also accomplishes that. It takes a group of kids and young adults and sends them across the galaxy on a mission to save Meg's father. It has all of the elements of a grand adventure, with gorgeous scenery, magical moments, and an ominous, dark presence to fight.I think what people are having trouble with, especial die-hard fans of AWIT, is that most of the book is centered around Meg and her internal dialogues. Her POV is very heavily personal-experience driven, and that's very hard to do visually. For instance, Meg doesn't like tesseracting in the books, because her body goes numb, and it feels like her entire body has been asleep. Coming out of the tesseract is the reverse of that process. So...how do you *show* that in a film? You can't. But the image in people's heads who have read book think they have ways to portray that sort of thing, but it's only relevant to themselves. And when they don't see it on the big screen, I think they get a little angsty and disappointed. I was not disappointed, and I understand a lot of the choices they had to make to bring such a book to the screen. Some wishes for the movie:\nThe Aunt Beast sequence I feel would have been very important. It was a game-changer that would have given the audience a moment to see Meg turn herself around. I think the trauma and recovery would have been a good sequence to have. I think Meg's sudden self-empowerment is a bit too sudden.The ending fight in the giant...brain?...of IT felt over too fast. The book does it masterfully with a lot of buildup to Meg's sudden realization of the weapon she has that IT does not. I think skipping that important point damaged the ending, and her screams of \"I love you!\" lost a bit of their edge. And I really loved the line in the book about \"She could stand there, and she could love Charles Wallace.\" I wish they had incorporated that somehow, because it always brings me a smile at that turning point. I don't think they visually gave her that realization and turning point. They just focused on her faults and then love, and then suddenly Charles Wallace was free.Central Central intelligence was tossed in there, but was never really explained as to what it meant. I think either an entire removal of the concept, or an explanation would have been better than just a throwaway line for the fans.Man With the Red Eyes wasn't nearly as menacing enough. Too jolly, not enough bite.More emphasis on the mind-control that was happening with IT. The heart-beating rhythm wasn't emphasized enough.In the prison room, I feel Calvin was underutilized. He was essential to distracting Charles Wallace, so that Meg could use Mrs. Who's glasses to get inside the prison in the book. I wished they had had a better confrontation between Calvin and Charles Wallace, the kind of mental battle I thought would have spiced up that scene a bit more.I gave it 9 stars due to the wishes, but I thought it was a great movie.",

First of all \u00ab IT \u00bb was supposed to have taken over the country camazotz. And what was with the weird storm when they got to camazotz. Their were so many little details missed that were like an afterthought, which is weird because Disney is usually very detailed. The craziest thing about this movie is that Disney forgot the actual point of the book/movie. At camazotz everyone had the same things and did the same things at the same time. The point of the book was to point out that our differences make us better and happier and more interesting people. Overal the movie felt rushed and all over the place as if they were trying to cram as much as they could in within the time frame. Disney could have done so much better \u00ab the original and the remake \u00bb. Third times the charm Disney!PS. Almost worth it to watch just for the costumes!",

            "review_title": "Utterly Unremarkable",
            "content": "One thing that should be noted when making a book into a movie is that it should offer something to fans of the book and also be friendly to someone who hasn't read the book. I have never read the book. Going into the movie, I expect it to tell me what exactly is happening, not assume I know what's up from the book. While watching, I just felt like I was missing huge chunks of information. I knew nothing of what was happening or of the world this story took place in. I assume we are supposed to know as much as the main character, Meg, who seemed to know nothing as well. That said, she was much more... \"accepting\" of what was happening than I was. I don't know what Meg is like in the book, but in this movies, she is just an awfully boring and passive character. She obviously doesn't want to be on the adventure, but she also doesn't resist it. she just lets it happen and shows little reaction to any of it. Even when she is showing emotion, if you can call it that, it's so forced. I don't know if they cast the wrong actress or the script was written poorly, I just know what I see and it sucks. It especially disappointing because they used a black girl. They could have written her so much better, gotten in some meaningful representation. I don't want to relate to Meg. She's a flat character and offers positive qualities to the table.Going back to not knowing anything about the story, I didn't even know what was happening half the time. Who are the weird ladies? Who is Whatsit's boyfriend?? Is this about time travel???? I just didn't know. Not to mention that they presented the strange ladies as important characters that just left the kids on their own??? And why are they named what they are named? Why did Charles Wallace know them? And now to move into the petty problems I have. Starting with names.Charles Wallace. I assume this is more an issue carried over from the book. In which case, I criticize the book as well! I get it, OK? people can have two first names. My mom and some of her siblings have two first names. But no one goes around using both of them. That's such a mouthful, and an earful. I don't want to hear them yelling that kids name over an over and over again, its long and annoying and frankly unnecessary. Just pick one! Or better yet, just give the kid a nickname! And Calvin? He added nothing to the story other than some heterosexual tension. And there shouldn't be ANY sexual tension cause these are kids and also there is no time for that, they are on a mission. Also, I just don't like his name. It's not a bad name. I just don't like it. It doesn't suit him.Secondly, oh, and this is truly my favorite. Ms Who? And her only speaking in quotes? Because she's too smart to think up her own words? First of all, that sounds pretentious. Secondly, it sounds stupid. It doesn't make her seems smart. It makes her seem... what's the word? I don't know but not coming up with an original thought and instead opting to use famous quotes is the most unintelligible thing I have ever heard. I'd have been fine if she did not have the ability to use her own words, sort of an echolalia situation, because that adds something meaningful to the character, maybe someone can relate to that. But that is not the case. She is capable of original thought and chooses not it. And some of the quotes she uses are so cryptic! Its more cryptic than cryptic can even be! But that just might be me being stupid. But if I recall, this is a kids movie. I would hope they could make the quotes easy for kids to follow along to.I think the message of the story is to love yourself and know that you deserve to be loved by others but... I only got that through what Meg said to her brother? The message was barely shown in the movie, at least not in any meaningful way. You had bits and pieces where Oprah told Meg that so many things had to happen for her to be born just the way she was, but it seemed like a passing moment. That it would not be a major thing. And it never was. I didn't feel Meg's struggle to love herself. She was always more caught up on her father and anything she said about not liking herself was just words. It wasn't until the end that I thought, \"Oh, that's the moral of the story?\"All in all, I felt the movie really missed the mark. It's flaws left me uninterested in the movie and it really was a waste of time.",

Let's start off with how unfaithful it is to the book it's based off of: Entire sections from the Wrinkle In Time book are cut out from this movie. For starters, instead of finding Meg's father by going into the Camazotz headquarters and having to fight the red-eyed man inside and Charles Wallace under his possession, the part of the movie on Camazotz is restrained to completely boring borderline filler. Eventually they reach what the movie calls the Camazotz headquarters but it's an empty room where Meg's father is just sitting up in another empty room connected by an invisible staircase. Another big change is that the planet Ixchel is completely removed from the movie despite being a major part of the book without any attempt to even replace it. Even more randomly it seems they changed the introduction and conclusion specifically to highlight Calvin as a love interest. Another issue that sinks the movie: The visuals do not live up to the book's descriptions. The beautiful creature described on Uriel literally looks like flying cabbage in the movie and Camazotz looks less like the madness described in the book and more like a generic small town neighborhood. Possibly a bigger issue than terrible illustration or terrible adaptation, however, is terrible pretentiousness. The movie as a whole has this attitude that it's woke and deep with the flashbacks of bad things happening on Earth and the semi-vague descriptions of IT that make the whole thing play out like the protagonists are on an ego trip. I had to stop here because I'm late for something but yeah this movie sucks.",

Some of her scenes really blew me away. I also enjoyed each of the \"misses\" immensely. The story was great but the writing sometimes felt stunted with very little world building. My girlfriend was confused throughout the entire story. I just felt like the story could've gone so much further while explaining a little more along the way. The graphics were great but some of the editing/directing made it feel chopped up and inconsistent. Lots of extreme, extensive close ups. In particular, a lot of the music choices really bothered me. Maybe it's just me but adding modern music with lyrics in a sci-fy fantasy movie really takes me out of the story and cheapens the whole thing.

I don't like fantasy and went into it not expecting to like it but am pleasantly surprised. I think the difficulties the children experience when their father disappears is well portrayed. I like how the boy goes off at the teachers for their idle gossip about something that is so deeply personal to him (the disappearance of his father) and sticks up for his sister who is being systematically bullied since their father's disappearance because of her vulnerability.. He is promptly called crazy along with her for which his sister retaliates and is told by the incompetent principal that it was an unprovoked attack and that she is trying to use \"her father's disappeared\" card for four years as an excuse for her aggression and is told to cut it out.It is later revealed the principal was indeed selected over better candidates for the position,. Then the movie moved from social justice themes into the trippier themes of time travel and the timeless fight between good and evil. (People criticise that it didn't show the father and friend tessering back, but everything obvious thing doesn't need to be spelled out in a movie. They tessered back the same way the brother and sister did).. Meg stayed back to rescue her brother that had been possessed by evil and it could only be overcome with love. Meg had to face all that was dark and hidden about herself, all the things she didn't want to accept about herself to be strong enough to save her brother. Only the strength of pure love could overcome evil and she achieved that. People may think that is corny but in my 50 years, I have only got strong by facing my weakness and I have only overcome evil with love. The themes are pretty solid for me. That is my lived experience. I actually liked the costuming. I liked seeing what they would do with the makeup, the clothes and the transformation into other creatures. If people are so disappointed with the movie, the book must be outstanding or just not focus on the themes of social justice and good vs evil as much - or has it's qualities in another area that the movie missed and disappointed viewers. It held me all through and I enjoyed it.",

The cinematography was beautiful; they make great use of CGI to depict the alien worlds, while still maintaining the realness of the main characters. I also thought the pacing was good. I was worried it was going to move too slow, but it ended up moving slow in the parts where it should and moving fast where it shouldn't.I liked the unconventional cast, though maybe Oprah didn't need to be in there. In the book Meg is supposed to be awkward, so people who are saying she can't act are just misunderstanding how she's supposed to be acting. The story is about embracing your faults and figuring out a way to use them to succeed in life; it wouldn't have worked to have Meg be swashbuckling.The main difference between the movie and the book is in the movie IT is actively trying to get them, whereas in the book IT is much more passive. I didn't mind the change. I think the PG13 rating confused some people-- this is a definitely a kids movie, but one that grown ups can also appreciate.",

Really. There are some moments in this film, albeit small moments that the dialogue is exquisite and really made me sit forward and think. In fact at one point I was even nodding in agreement with what Oprah was saying about how the main character got to where she was. There were a few moments like that that saved me from turning it off. There was also other visual moments that kept me watching, like her last leap through space/time to get home. It such a shame that Disney has taken another, what I'm sure was a, literary masterpiece and tore it to shreds to make a quick buck to add to the billions they already have.

To me, it feels like the director couldn't handle the weight of the project and simply tried to get the shots done in time. The hinting at technical scientific theories is weak and brushed under the carpet, even though it's for kids it still felt weak.

Storm Reid does a respectable job as Meg, her performance arguably gets better as things progress - which is the opposite to the film overall. Chris Pine is underused in his role, but the casting of Oprah Winfrey, Reese Witherspoon and Mindy Kaling is good - Zach Galifianakis too. I didn't actually find Deric McCabe's character, Charles Wallace, annoying like most seemingly did.\n\nSurprised to see that this has a low rating across the board.

A good mystery gives subtle clues along the way to immerse the audience in what's going on. This was like a mystery with no clues where you're just expected to follow along blindly from beginning to end. By time the movie is over you feel like 'so what?'

It has pretty great casting in my opinion, and had amazing visuals and a really sweet clear message at it's core. But what I don't like about this movie, though, is the fact that it seems like a bit of cash grab, ya know? Like they were a little more focused on the money aspect, and less on the actual storytelling. Like, I don't like a lot of Meg's lines, or just her general vibe throughout the movie to be honest, even though the actress portraying her had so much potential. I loved the guy playing Calvin, I think he did a great job and they brought to life a very unique vision of him, which I really loved. I just wish we had more time with him, because he kind of seems like 'just along for the ride', even though he is so much deeper in the book. The only real character development we get from him is his dad, and that one line from the It. I also really loved Charles Wallace, and he's to be honest the only main character besides the Mrs', that has no actual faults. The casting was perfect, he had good dialogue, he was likable just like he was in the book. Mr and Mrs Murray were okay, I guess, we didn't get too much time with them so they don't even matter that much. Also, I think the Veronica role was just shoved in movie to make it so they have another well-known star in there. All in all, it just seems a little lazily put together, but had SO MUCH potential. I loved their take on this universe and story, it had such a unique signature to it, but with the lazy writing and some lazy shots here and there, it kind of didn't go all of the way that it needed to. I kind of wish they did, because then we get to see how they bring the rest of the series to life, which would be really cool to see. But what can I say, it's disney.",

It had a profound effect on me. 40 years later I still can't see subdivisions without thinking about the scene from the book where they are standing on the hill on Camazotz looking down at the houses and all the houses look exactly the same. Sameness became a dirty word for me. The book made me value those things that made me different. I would guess that maybe 20% of the movie comes from the book. The rest was created, written for the movie. I wanted to love the movie. But the drastic rewriting of the story made it impossible at the end. I've watched movies that had nothing to do with the original source: Robert Downing Jr. in Sherlock for instance. It has very little to do with the Conan Doyle version of Sherlock but it's fun as heck to watch. The changes made between L'Engle's book and the movie make no sense. They weaken the story. Mrs. Whatsit would never have kicked Meg in the book, why did they have her do it in the movie? Thirty minutes into the film and I found myself hating Mrs. Whatsit. At one point in the book there is an intense struggle between Charles Wallace and a certain entity, but in the movie he just instantly yields. Why? It goes against everything that Charles Wallace was/is. Over and over the movie rewrites the book to it's own detriment. By the end I was bitterly disappointed, angry, and frustrated. Loved the actors, except maybe Charles Wallace. My advice, go read the book.",

But Duverny has no understanding of how to shoot fantasy, at first coming across awkwardly against the urban backdrop and then later in a soulless void of green screen with flat plates of actors and vistas with no grounding or relevance. Wrinkle has a stodgy  story with no relatable sense of logic; typically, although cliche, these kinds of fantasy kids films end up portraying the fantasy elements as connected to the grief or fear of the child as they grow up. This film just throws colourful nonsense at us willy billy with no explanation of the logic and no way of connecting to any of it. One imagines that if this were a 2D animated Ghibli film it would be spectacular and appropriate, but like this it ironically seems lifeless and disconnected and pointless. \nIt's twists and turns are predictable and the action is turgid. The way characters meet and the plot moves on are utterly contrived, it's disappointing really. \nIt's not a terrible film, and sometimes with the dramatic elements it can actually be quite stirring and emotional, it's just mostly a film that misses the mark in every department.",

Too much time was spent in the beginning with SUNSHINE, and LOW KEY DELIVERY, where everyone spoke in whispers,and smiles!  IT WAS A \"DARK AND STORMY NIGHT\" WITH A PURPOSE!!!  Loneliness, heartbreak from the mother (from Meg hearing her cry every night), Who, Whatsit, and Which appeared at NIGHT - with the door flying open in the storm, not all \"glittery and sunshine and smiles\" like it's an ordinary day.  It does not have munchkins singing about the \"Yellow Brick Road\", and this looks like it is set up to be that way. The story has foreboding in every word Whatsit, Who and Which speak! The time should be spent when Meg tries to recover from the Tesseract, and the creatures has long arms, more like an octopus, not a green video game Princess that looks like a Sea Monkey you buy from the back of a comic!! Children express themselves with abandonment, not \"whispers\"!!!  UPLIFTING voices, even in fear! The director had the kids speak so monotone, it became boring very quickly! I mean, who cares about the kids before they even get to the \"village\"??? And, OPRAH - what happened to that great actress that had us in the palm of your hand when you were in the Color Purple?  Your delivery was so..... FLAT!!!!!  Who cares if you are \"looking for a man who is lost in the universe?\"  It seemed like you just wanted to go \"around the corner\" and you would find him! This is a story that can make you shudder, and feel some trepidation and fear, only to have such a showdown with \"IT\" that never materialized here! I mean, what's the matter with you, Director????  Don't YOU have the imagination and wonder and thrill of discovery that a child has???  TAKE THAT AND PUT IT OUT ON THE SCREEN!!! There should be the 'introductory scene\" of the village with the children bouncing the balls in tandem, and the permeating \"thud thud thud\" of the rhythm of the  bouncing ball, that slowly creeps into the pulsing vein in Charles Wallace's head when he and \"IT\" confront the other kids!!!! THIS should be an adventure, not a stroll through Wonderland.   Not so with the way this was directed!!!!",

Storm Reid, especially, is mature in her acting ability, employing finer nuances of powerful emotion in her performance. Oprah Winfrey, however, is there for name power only. She is not an actor and it shows throughout her uninspired, pandering performance. The story is, itself, inspiring and beautiful with obvious Judaeo-Christian symbolism throughout with such ideas as overcoming adversity, even evil - as well as obeying God's commands, relying upon inspiration, and turning weaknesses into strengths. Religious symbolism includes effective archetypes of the godhead and the devil, Adam & Eve, the forbidden fruit of the tree of The Knowledge of Good and Evil, the Garden of Eden and the fallen earth (I could go on) are all throughout and well used within the story. These concepts are simplified and woven into the story in a way that a full grasp of them is not necessary to appreciate the over-arching theme of good versus evil and one can enjoy the movie even if the symbolism is missed. This movie isn't polished enough to warrant a sequel. Most of the story retelling and acting is just okay - leaving the beauty solely in the hands of the over-arching story itself: which beauty, thankfuly, remains intact. A good movie to watch at home, especially with the family due to it's positive moral themes.",

Oprah's performance was stale, stiff, unemotional, and unmemorable.  If she was supposed to be Glinda type guide she failed terribly.  Reese Witherspoon on the other hand, overacted, too loud, too much all around.  Mindy Kaling was dull also, seems I seen her on the cooking network.  None of them had emotional ties to their characters they were just reading a script, not performing as a character.  The little girl was OK, but she needs to be on Disney Channel for a while get some experience before taking on a movie roll.  The bright star is the little boy Deric McCabe he took on a complex role with many twists and a lot of dialog and he handled it well for such a young boy.  But he needs more experience also.

It reminds me of when a kid has a project and they wait to do it until the night before it\u2019s due. This film has plot lines that come and go. There is a whole montage of like I think it was supposedly be the darkness in the world. That plot line disappears. Then there\u2019s this bully and like there\u2019s no real reason she doesn\u2019t like the girl (please bare with me the film is so bad I forgot all the names) and then the rest of the movie she isn\u2019t mentioned until the end for no reason. The CGI in this movie is so rushed I could do it in iMovie. The acting is mediocre at best (I understand they are kids but have you seen E.T). Here\u2019s the one good part of the film. Chris Pine. Let\u2019s get this straight, his plot line and relationships aren\u2019t good but his beard is awesome and it seems like he\u2019s the only person who knew how to act in the film. This is the problem. Disney doesn\u2019t want to make anything new. They give a ton of money to new directors hoping they will make something good. This is the same with the new nutcracker and with Artemis fowl. Disney needs to get back with their creativity and make new animated movies not remakes or giving loans to make crap like this they can succeed. The only thing making them money is the properties they bought. Disney films have been going downhill but this was a cheap and dark turn for Disney.",

It's extremely metaphoric and aligns with my spiritual identity exactly.  I felt connected to the idea that love is our most important emotion and the idea of finding your true self through personal strife. I think people have taken this movie literally and missed the deep underlying point. It had my daughter and me in tears because the things they handle in the film are very real for us (abandonment, obsession with work to the point of losing family, selfishness, mistrust of others, etc.) If you are Buddhist, this movie will speak to you as it did to me.

Unfortunately, I am going to have to wonder if the consistent flat characters and forced whimsical acting, is the fault of director Ava Duvernay. I have not seen Selma but it got lots of praise for its acting so I have my fingers crossed that the flat script etc was more at fault than the director. Duvernay is attached to DC/Warner Bros adaptation of The New Gods, a project that has the potential to break my heart, so I want her to succeed.\nChris Pine and Gugu Mbatha-Raw, as the only adult human characters in the film, are both very good and convincing. The rest of the talented cast are not given much to do besides be cute/menacing and explain the plot. \nThere is a lot of story and science removed from the source material yet it seems like there is not enough happening on screen to justify the run time. Unlike, say, the Harry Potter films there is not enough story in the book to justify the edits and Wrinkle in Time is a thin experience.",

I find it an evolved type of inspirational movie that speaks to the heart of issues faced by distinct subjects. This movie is about a tenacious, fiery, young, black girl who through nature and nurture is strong yet not allowed to show any signs of it. It;'s about self acceptance and love. Then, when I see the scenes where she's instructed to embrace herself to \"tesser well\" and the reminder that \"aberrations are far more interesting\", i'm not surprised by the widespread reaction. It's a reaction of privilege. Imagine judging the movie on the CGI, as if that ever mattered in a movie taking on such an audacious topic. Even the missing paternal figure storyline fits well with the key audience and it's even refreshing. I come out of watching it with so many positive mantras and insights and I just hope that the intended audiences are like me and never listen to the mainstream bent reviews take. Just see the movie!! It will clean the lense of self-loathing that comes standard in this universes starter-pack.",

The flowers say something in flower language, so Mrs. Whatsit turns into a giant flying lettuce leaf and carries the kids away. Oh, they must be going to find the father. A kid falls off and is caught by the flowers. Then they teleport to a completely different place. Wait...what? Why were we flying on the lettuce, if not to find the father?

Things that don't seem to drive the story forward, or they do, but we don't understand how or why.\n\nThere are parts of this movie that seem like they have to have been pulled directly from the book, because the writing is so atrocious on screen.

But I finally decided to give it a chance this week on Netflix. Sadly, it was even worse than I'd expected. Even with a cast of star actors, it was all just too sappy and cutesy. I'm not usually the person who complains when movies deviate from the books, as I can almost always enjoy each for their own merits. But in this case, it felt like they took the bare bones of the book and turned it into a falsely bright and goody-goody story that simply didn't do justice to the original in any fashion. Also, I'm a fan of diversity. I usually don't mind at all when directors take liberties with the source material in order to offer diverse characters. But this was...overkill. It felt like someone (the director? Disney?) was trying to make a point of checking as many cultural/ethnic boxes as possible, even changing Charles Wallace to an adopted child in order to (it felt to me) include yet another diverse character. Don't get me wrong, the little boy who played Charles Wallace was brilliant. But on top of everything else, it just felt contrived. Overall, the movie was far too floofy and sugary, like the director was afraid the source story wasn't good enough or wouldn't be appealing enough to kids and adults (never mind it's been an award-winning, bestselling classic for decades). So it had to be prettied up and made to appear visually bright and colorful and magical, like the inside of a candy store. For me...it fell flat and I came away from it thinking it was one of the worst movies I've seen in a good long time. And I think I would have felt that way even if I had never read the book.",

            "content": "SPOILERS BELOW. \n\nI didn't love the old movie as much as the book and this new remake wasn't what I wanted in a movie about this book either but I understand why they did what they did. \n\nFirst of all THERE ARE SPOILERS here so don't read from here on out if u want to watch it fresh with no spoilers and want surprises. If u I ant to want it and get angry, read the book. Wait a week. Read it again. Refer to the book often to fact check before watching it so you have it all in your head. And honestly I think he first movie was worse in comparison to the new one so if u really want to enjoy this one, watch them both so you will like Disney's new one more. Continuing on now. \n\nThe book was amazing. I've read it perhaps six times in thirty years and don't remember but I may have done a report on it once and probably discussed the book often with other readers and peers so keep it in mind during my review. Also I have read all the books and have about decent memory if not total understandIng of the series as well so some things missing irritate me. That's a big problem I have with the new movie as well that colors my perspective. I also have a strong belief in keeping true to the original book and series when making a movie and can see reasoning as to why things were cut for production and time reasons but I don't like them and this also colors my perspective. But I will try to be fair. Here goes. \n\nSo a lot was cut out or barely mentioned from the book in the new movie. The Jenkins arc was barely referenced and and not touched upon at all. That sucks. Time was probably the main reason, and that goes for a lot of my gripes. \n\nThe movie had hardly no impact or reference for this being a battle for Charles Wallace's \"soul\" or being forced to conform to society or remain an individual. Time again probably and maybe it was too deep for a Disney movie. Disney probably didn't want the artraction of meg and Calvin as a focal point due to their ages I'd guess. I dont think Charles Wallace was adopted in the book, but it made some sense for the tension of the IT controlled kid to play into his attitude to the Dad. I'll attribute that to creative license I guess. But I think it also lessens the love of meg to Charles Wallace and that isn't my feelings of an adopted kid being loved less or anything, certainly not according to my believes or anything in my life, I'm just assuming it wasn't done to help explain the dialogue used in the movie. Opinion only as I said. \n\nI don't remember the dog being in any scenes but my kid said it was there somewhere so it probably wasn't but had no impact on me watching it and so time probably was the reason as we'll as the big boy being integral so there u go. Think it wasn't called fortinbras in the book and I vaguely remember hearing someone say FORT early on so okay whatever. Calvin's one or two lines about his home life in response to meg talking about why who used Calvin know about not being accepted everywhere and maybe he was only looked at as a jock to me felt overlooked and mentioned briefly as a nod to what was actually pretty important to his character background and thus making him more important to being in the film at all. Without that backstory or such I just saw him as being hungry a couple times and pretty useless in the movie except to play as a foil to meg in showing they shouldn't stay and conform on the planet with the mustached guy. Sigh. May as well have taken him completely ouT of the film without all that. Like they basically did with Jenkins. Jenkins is super important in my opinion to the story as his arc with meg and Charles giving them backstory and how they don't really fit in at school but it was all basically cut.  Time probably was the reason and they chose to focus on the rescue. \n\nI thought Charles was basically a recluse and mute at school in the book. Don't remember him going off like the movie had him do. I'll give it to them because it made him more attractive on screen as a good little brother and defensive of his family which made his turn against his dad when the it controlled him more impactful on the screen so I get it even though i like the book setup much more. And the teachers knowing Charles was gifted I thought was important to tell the audience in the movie since they cut out all the family interaction really so o understand it if not agree with the choice. \n\nI don't remember seeing the twins at all. Which in addition to all the stuff that was cut from the movie that was in the book makes me strongly believe that they have absolutely no plans on doing the other books as movies. They are sort of inportant in other books, and what interactions and dialogue that wasn't in the movie about a lot of these things make doing the sequels harder without laying the groundwork now. I really think that they should have committed more and done this as a multipart miniseries of maybe five or six hours and done it to scale and really fleshed out the entire book. If Disney got the rights just to make money on a single movie and ignore the rest, then all the cuts make sense. So in my jaded opinion they did this as a money grab and edited it down to what was integral in their timeframe and ignored the rest or made just passing reference to parts that the book used to help tell the entire story. I truly believe they just wanted to make money on a single movie and cut way too much. As a whole the book should really be told in its entirety. \n\nThe special effects were good. Disney I think threw too much music into the score and at times it needed to be lower in volume so the dialogue was more distinct. In some cases the inpactfulness of a scene and the essential dialogue and acting was reduced by loud music and scoring. \n\nThe story was really dumbed down for the audience, and maybe that is because it was aimed at kids and not people who know the book. He wanted to entertain and not have kids ask parents questions during the film. I'm guessing that in that vein they accomplished their goal and that wasn't meant to insult any kids or their intelligence. I feel that the book was aimed at perhaps a sixteen year old kid up to an adult in their twenties. This movie I feel was aimed at kids from ten to sixteen and if they are on the younger side obviously to be watched with their parents. Purely an opinion. I haven't any idea on how bright kids are now or what their level of understanding is. I'm going by ages of kids from my era. I am about forty years old to give you a reference point. Again, no insult intended to anyone's intelligence level is intended. I am guessing. And obviously this is a Disney movie I assume is aimed at a younger demographic. I feel they only just barely touched on meg and her faults and acceptance or embracing of such and honestly the focus of her love for (or of if u prefer) Charles Wallace was obviously there but not as impactful as in the book. Either by design or not I am not sure. It didn't seem like the major focal point or epiphany as the book intended in my opinion, because I'd think that Disney would beat you over the head with it in a movie. I appreciated it not being in a way that obviously pandered to me, but it did seem underwhelming in comparison to the book. And I don't know if I like their choice or not. \n\nIf I'm remembering correctly, meg was at l set at one point in the book \"lost\" or being taken over by the IT and she needed to be brought back into \"herself\" for lack of a better term.  All I can find in the movie that is sort of like this is when her dad is trying to bring her back or wake her up whatever the hell was going on there. As I recall in the book, she needed to recite chemistry or math problems or something GROUNDED IN SCIENCE and her brain and memory and knowledge to recover her being. That didn't happen here. Her dad basically just called her name and shook her or something and she was back. Then he was going to leave her again (after saying minutes earlier I'd never leave you and then said he never meant to be gone so long but that has nothing to do with his original choice to actually leave her and now he's doing it again which i chuckled at after pausing the movie to point this out to my family as we were all watching it together and after thinking about it since then has made me angrier at the illogic and poor wording.). Well, the only thing close to the recovery of megs core being from the book is ironically how the IT got control of Charles Wallace in the movie. Reciting the two times table. Which is mathematics. Which in the book is a major part of what makes meg a standout if not as a student but an intelligent girl. It sort of fits the narrative the movie shows as an obvious logical pattern. The bouncing balls the kids do in the driveways and the houses and identical mothers speaking in unison. I get it. Anyone watching the movie has figured out this obvious connection. So maybe I'm not remembering the book perfectly because I was sure meg was amazing at math and reciting facts about such was how she was recovered in the book. Maybe it was chemistry which is basically just math in the number of electrons to join elements together or maybe it was her calculating pi or an equation which is not repeating or something that would stand out as a pattern but I'm pretty sure math was involved as a few of the questions either Calvin or her dad or Charles Wallace used to bring her back. And I think it happened twice actually. But the movie didn't use anything to bring her back. That pissed me off. \n\nNow I am almost CERTAIN there was not even a mention of a farandolae (excuse the spelling if it's off) with a name that had to bury or root itself and grow or something and it was actually inside Charles Wallace and it was the one deciding factor that would determine if he was going to go good or bad, conform or stay individual, etc. He had a name too. Now it HAS BEEN several years since I read any of the books at all so I'm going off a memory of at least a dozen years here. Maybe I'm wrong and this is from a later book. But I am pretty sure it's from WRINKLE and it was a major part of the story.  Why was this cut?  Time?  Didn't want to scare or confuse kids?  Keep focus of movie on rescuing Dad?  Too deep into science or sci-fi?  Any or all. Whatever the reason, I feel this was a tremendous loss. Didn't Megan's love of the farandolae youngster rescue him and help him root and win the battle and he helped them later?  This whole adventure near the end seemed to take place on a planet. I thought the \"planet\" was a short stay like a weigh station to rest up and return to the battle later when they met up with the witches again and then the entire time after was inside Charles Wallace. Was the dad inside Charles Wallace?  Not sure I remember if they rescued their dad from inside him or what in the book, but they did seem to simplify all this to not confuse the audience (I still believe it's mainly aimed at kids anyway) and removed even more science from this story. \n\nThere's more I didn't like. I truly hated a great deal of things in the film that were either changed, dumbed down, barely referenced, or missing completely that were in the book. And this stuff happens. I get that doing this movie in full like the book would probably take twice as long. I get it. Maybe even five hours. People won't sit for that in a theater. And probably not kids. Got u. Disney HAS A NETWORK.  Maybe multiple ones I don't know. Channels. They could easily have shot this into five or so hours and cut it up into a miniseries. Show it an hour a day for five days. Or three episodes of two apiece I dunno. They could have done this I mean they have the distribution and can release a two disc set for sale as well as showing it over a couple days and advertise  it I mean they have the money airtime network distribution...they have the means. Why sacrifice so much to throw out another two hour movie and cut so much and adapt it for such a different audience???\n\nIt is an injustice to those of us that wanted to see the book fleshed out and done fully. I think they cut way too much story, arcs, and dumbed it down for a different target demographic than what the book was originally intended. For a two hour fantasy movie, I guess it was okay. They made money. I think lots of it. But this wasn't what I could or should have been and they left a lot more money on the table for future use. The other books. A longer movie replacing this also fills more airtime and builds the watching audience up begging for more. Sequels on the other books. And they could ALWAYS cut down the original long version I'd have preferred and adapted it into this film or even reshot it. Hell they could have animated this into a cartoon later or done it with the ducks like they did with the old Christmas special or even the (non-Disney) chipmunks go to the movies series they used to adapt famous movies. \n\nThere were several options to utilize with their VAST RESOURCES that would have been superior to this movie version and they could have banked on what I listed above as spinoffs or the like AFTER doing this film. Which I'm sure they won't do. I assume they own the rights now to the book and likely the series. Why not start off with a long true to story version that's longer and uses everything in the first book and leaving the seeds for the others later down the line?  Like I said they could edit and shorten it to make a second version close to what they made, and even gone animated even for it. As is, they made a movie that is based on a good book and honestly in my opinion this was a one and done with absolutely no thought to the rest of the books. It's not as deep as the book, it's in my opinion dumbed down and devoid of the science and math and several plot points and story arcs that are needed for later, and all I see is a very base version of what could have been excellent. \n\nI described this movie to my family before we watched it to  never ending story, narnia (which I never read or saw,) with some science and sci-fi aspects like sliders and star trek. I was just throwing things out that they were familiar with to give an idea mind you. That's not what we watched. This was devoid of science, plot points and story arcs, the characters were much less deep with less background and detail, and it was to me honestly aimed at young children.  There was nothing really that parents and kids could sit down with and explain afterwards or even during, certainly nothing to prompt multiple viewings to take specific note of dialogue to look deeper into the characters, and t was almost totally based on the power of love as well as accepting ones faults and loving yourself despite them. Not because of them. Not because your faults make u unique and working towards betting yourself because now you know what they are, which honestly is where I figured they would end up like an old afternoon special tv show on the weekends on abc which I think Disney owns that channel anyway, but it's a block of a couple hours that doesn't make one think nearly as much as the book and is missing way too much. \n\nThis is an opinion. I don't proclaim to be a master of knowing everything about all the books or even the one book this was based on. I admit I haven't read them in years. I haven't watched the original movie in years. My memory is not perfect. And again, I don't mean to criticize anyone that enjoyed this version, the prior one, nor the books. I don't mean to come across as condescending or insulting younger viewers when I say this was aimed at a younger demographic of kids or that it was dumbed down. It was fine. It was entertaining. The special effects were good and the dialogue from what I remember had important lines I think were unchanged or slightly perhaps, and maybe some was completely new or out of order or context, whatever. This is solely my opinion. And it was a good movie. I just think it wasn't aimed at the same group of people the book was, the movie was missing a lot of stuff that I as a child and also now as an adult kept me guessing, forced me to think more, and want to read the other books. This movie was less than the book, and I don't want to rewatch it to find more clues I may have missed and I certainly don't want to learn about science after watching it because it was much more about fantasy and not science or sci-fi. It was fine. I think it could have been awesome. Whatever was added to the production by visually watching it was hampered by what I could not find in the movie that was in the book. And I truly feel they wasted future opportunities by removing so much. And I understand that they had to fit it into a movie and cut things. But...did they have to really?  It probably did well and made money. Maybe a true to book version while much longer may not have done as welll. Probably not. But adults like me who read even only that book were not satisfied and wanted more. They could shorten it later and edit another version like this one. Animate it. Put the long one on tv as a miniseries or something and if not shorten it for theatrical release then reshoot it and use the long version to promote it in theaters or on dvd. \n\nNever ending story was superior as a film for theaters in my opinion. Forget the story aspect...that's subjective...but the  defects even for the time in my opinion were great and both films sort of were told the same way and ended the same way generally speaking. Feel good at the end. Both were fantasy and not about science. The book had more science, and many more things as I said before that were not in the movie. Was there a neverendinn story book before the film?  Maybe. I don't know. Really I don't. If there was maybe the same sort of cuts were made there. But if know there were two sequels of movies to it and if there were three books or more written before the film maybe some people said the same things then. If so then maybe the two sequel movies have nothing to do with the original books of ther was a series written prior. But I do know that this new movie left no reason for me to wait for another film. There were no hints or seeds left to entice me. \n\nMy kids saw never ending story less than a year ago.  Loved it. I said there was a sequel. They demanded I go get it. I said there were actually three altogether. We got them all and watched them as a marathon. Y s we saw the original and then the next two straight through despite seeIf the first the day before.  \n\nWe just watched the new wrinkle movie last night. Liked it. I said I think there's an older version of it and maybe they'll do a sequel. They didn't care. And I agree. There's nothing making us want to see what's next. What did they not touch on. We all feel like we saw it all. So a two hour movie. I spent about half an hour explaining what else should have been in there, since I read the book. They are fighting over who gets to read it first. I found my original copy from I think sixth grade or so. Now two of them are reading my two copies. And the others are having them all read it together, ON THEIR OWN AS SIBLINGS AND THEIR FRIENDS ARE OVER TO NOW SPEND ANOTHER NIGHT HERE not watching tv or movi s or computer or on phones or whatever. They are reading two books, one of which is my copy from like 1990 or something. And they keep coming up to me to ask me science stuff like is a farandolae real in science. Believe it or not they didn't run to their phone and google it. I started writing this post two hours ago in between making dinner and they have been running in here to ask me stuff about the book since. They did rewatch the movie just before because I have to return it to Redbox in a few hours. They are much more enthusiastic in their reading and questions than watching the movie. The second viewing earlier today they kept pausing to ask me things I had mentioned happened in the book last night. So this last one took almost an extra hour. They are two boys at six and seven, and six girls from five to sixteen. The older ones are reading aloud in turns. One is pouring through the second copy and Is now rereading it cause she is sure she missed something. Like I did years ago. Bless them. \n\nI whispered to the oldest that there are three (I think) after this one. Wind in the door and swiftly tilting planet, I forget the other. I do have a copy of each. She's demanding to see them now. I said u have to finish for the little ones first. Now the twenty year old girl had come home for a few days wondering why all these kids are reading. I just told her it's a wrinkle in time. She smiled and said I remember u let me read that a few years ago it was awesome. I said yeah they saw the new movie last night and now again today. She asked if  T was better than the old movie version I said yeah but the book is better. She is on her way to renew the redbox or return and redo it for another day but only reluctantly cause I said yeah I'll let let them read the sequels later. A twenty year old young woman in college studying animation and art. Her eyes went wide and she ran to my office and found the other titles and took them with her to renew the Redbox. She doesn't want the kids to ruin them or read them first. And she can bang out maybe 400 pages in six hours but I did mention that if u remember honey this is the book that makes u hunt back and figure stuff out u missed. Well at l art for me and for her then. She smirked and said yeah but I'll redo the movie watch it and then start the second book. She has to look up which is next I don't remember. But she is going to finish number two and then be on three when the young ones start 2. \n\nNow I have to point out here I didn't think they'd all stay interested. And they're are bathroom breaks and snacks and dinner and such going on here. But far as I can tell they watched last night. We talked about it hat was missing. They rewatched the movie. Honestly they don't care about the first movie even though I have it on vhs. Yeah. VHS. And they are about id guess fifty pages from finishing wrinkle the book. This has been about seven hours straight now of ALL KIDS and they aren't alll mine mind u sleepover and such staying with a wrinkle in time. And now the other kid just finished rereading it and wants the next which te daughter has renewing the Redbox. Uh oh. Well keeping this many kids caring about this on their own for so long is ridiculous. Just saying. Hey maybe a longer movie with ALL THE STUFF from the original book would HAVE MADE MORE SENSE. \n\nSorry this turned into such a long post. It started out with me wanting a longer better film. In the meantime as I started this turned into everyone in the house loving what the original story is. And I guess I'm not alone as in the hours since I started typing this everyone here won't let it go. And it isn't the movie. Thanks",

Worst of all the source material was mutilated beyond recognition. I sincerely apologize to the late Madeleine L'engle because I know disney won't although they really should. All I can say is that everyone involved in this movie should hang their heads in shame and subsequently resign from ever being near another movie.  disney should stay far away from subject matter that involves brain activity and just stick to their usual mass marketing paint by numbers mind numbing crap like another 5000 marvel and star wars films.

To be fair, it's utterly visually stunning, which is what earned it the additional half star in this review.  But beyond that, it's an overblown yet weak plot line.  Problems that didn't need to exist in the first place are given intense focus only to have a simplistic solution.  Meg's (Storm Reid) awkwardness is forced and never really fleshed out beyond some mean girls teasing her about her father being gone.  The scene where the kids get to Camazotz and are told \"don't let anything split you up\", but then Charles Wallace (Deric McCabe) is immediately separated from them is a giant, gaping plot contradiction.  I know this movie was lauded for casting women of color in the leading roles, but in this venue it loses the impact it could have made.  And the final message of \"no Meg, it was all about you\" is trite and disjointed, suitable for something other than a story witih a science fiction core.\n\nNow, to compare it to the book, it failied.  Miserably and utterly failed.  To start, the setting is completely off.  This is supposed to take place in a small town in New England where gossip and narrow-mindedness reign supreme, not the suburbs of Los Angeles.  Reese Witherspoon's portrayal of Mrs. Whatsit is completely WRONG.  She is critical and harsh where in the book, Mrs. Whatsit is loving, kind, and sweet.  I would have rather seen Witherspoon switch places with Winfrey, since Mrs. Which is supposed to be the harsh, cold one of the trio.  In the book, Camazotz is all about conformity.  The scene of the children with the balls is (mostly) correct, but from there they go into a faceless city and then enter Central central.  The beach scene just indicates to me that Ava DuVernay didn't understand the nature of Camazotz, or the natures of either the man with the red eyes OR Charles Wallace.  What's even more unfortunate is that Calvin (Levi Miller) is brought along for \"his diplomacy\" which the movie then never even attempts to use.  That's not even mentioning how badly his character has been watered down.  In the books, Calvin is beaten *because* he gets high grades and is incredibly intelligent, far more so than his half-dozen brothers and sisters.  He comes across Meg and Charles Wallace as he's trying to escape a household full of anger and stress.  This movie turns him into nothing more than just another kid with an overbearing, authoritative father yelling at him for getting \"ok\" grades.  And in the book, Meg doesn't just throw a ball at another girl, she punches the nose of a boy twice her size.  To me, that would have been much more empowering and indicative of standing up to a bully.\n\nI don't expect any movie to be a true representation of the book.  The only one I've found that came close was \"The Shawshank Redemption\".  But this was nothing more than some fanciful excuse to use big names in a lot of CGI while only maybe touching base with the book now and then.  There have got to be scores of other pre-teen books they could have used, they didn't have to ruin one of my childhood favorites.",

            "content": "- A Wrinkle in Time sparkles with fresh life and girl power -\n\nTime for another full disclosure: I've been worried about whether A Wrinkle in Time was going to be good.\n\nAll the ingredients were right. I'm a sold-out fangirl for director Ava DuVernay (Selma, 13TH). I adore that finally, FINALLY a major fantasy novel adaptation stars people of color. And of course, I always get jazzed about a new book-to-movie adventure!\n\nBut there was much to make me nervous. As much as I love Ava, she'd never made a kids movie before. Disney has quite the reputation for throwing money at big, splashy, colorful projects that turn out to be empty and frankly headache-inducing. Not to mention it's hard to turn a beloved book into a movie that everyone actually thinks is good!\n\nSo I got my ticket and tried to measure my expectations.\n\nAnd you know? A Wrinkle in Time is weird. It's surprising. Some scenes are big and splashy, and some are shockingly intimate. Right now it's actually scoring pretty low on review sites like IMDB and Rotten Tomatoes. But screw those guys. I liked it.\n\nFrom the moment that Mrs. Whatsit (Reese Witherspoon, Home Again), garbed beautifully in stolen bedsheets, flashed her eyes, proclaimed \"Wild nights are my glory!\" and ran into the stormy evening, I was sold.\n\nA quick recap for the new kids: A Wrinkle in Time is a kids book written in the 1950's about a girl named Meg Murray, her family, and the neighbor boy Calvin. It's a great romp about dimensions colliding in a fight for good and evil. The kids must team up with new supernatural friends to traverse galaxies and rescue Meg's father, a great scientist, who has been trapped by an evil power. It nearly didn't get published because it was so odd - and I love that the movie carries that same spirit.\n\nIt's humorous and self-aware at unexpected moments. The brother-sister team played by Storm Reid (12 Years a Slave) as Meg and Deric McCabe (Stephanie) as Charles Wallace are so charming and fresh, but more complex than your average kid characters. The grand, celestial beings called \"The Mrs.'s\" - played by Witherspoon, Mindy Kaling (Why Not Me?), and Oprah Winfrey (The Immortal Life of Henrietta Lacks) aren't just powerful and majestic. They are quirky, funny, and irreverent (just like they are in the boooooook!).\n\nIn fact, the movie goes for interesting, gutsy contradictions. I'm not used to the sight of warriors dressed in avant garde gowns and glittery makeup. I don't typically find movies where the hero discovers victory in her faults, instead of her strengths. And I certainly don't often watch kids stories where parents and their children square up so openly and brazenly about their vulnerabilities and hurts.\n\nTruthfully, this movie would never have been created in another era. For the first time, a Black woman stands at the helm of a $100+ million live-action project. And as she always does, Ms. DuVernay \"demand[ed] inclusiveness,\" according to Witherspoon, leading to diversity in both the cast and the crew.\n\nToday is a day to be excited as movies led by Black women become runaway box-office hits. 2018 is a year to be proud of the slow fade of girl-characters in movies who look to their male companions and ask (wide eyed) \"What do we do now?\" Not Meg. And not in Ava's movies.\n\nA Wrinkle in Time does have its weak points, for sure. Some melodrama can definitely be found coming from certain corners. Jennifer Lee (Frozen) and Jeff Stockwell's (Bridge to Terabithia) script, while strong in parts, sometimes fumbles. And, in the way of adaptations, the movie does sacrifice some important content from the book. But oh, Ava is so loving with her camera. The way she shoots her beloved cast takes the movie a step above what the script alone could have done.\n\nThere's no doubt that the people who made A Wrinkle in Time had a deep tenderness for their project, and for the novel itself. So many lines and homages are straight from the book, and watching it actually gave me the same feeling I got from reading it. The same kind of laughs and squirms, the same magical, empowering goodness.\n\nTake your kid, your buddy, your mom, or even just yourself to see this movie. Because this is one kids movie truly made with enough heart, wonder, and delight to rise above its faults. Just like Meg.\n\n----------\n\nThis review was first published on Narrative Muse, http://www.narrativemuse.co/movies/a-wrinkle-in-time, and was written by Debbie Holloway.

Unfortunately the story is disjointed and leaves too much unexplained, and Reese Witherspoon's sickeningly sweet Miss What'sit comes across as so insincere, you start to wonder if she is on the evil side. With it's commentary on social norms, violence, and religion this is hardly a family flick. Extremely disturbing visuals and emotionally traumatic dialogue make this film that was advertised as a family fun adventure fall extremely flat in my personal opinion. To summarize I've rarely watched a family film with a great cast and been left feeling this gross. I gave one star for Chris Pine in his role as the father, he was brilliant as always the rest of the actors were victims of bad script. Spare yourselves.",

Her scientist father (Chris Pine) has been missing for some time, and three mysterious beings appear to assist her in traveling through time and space to recover him.  Now I know how dearly some people hold this book to their hearts.  I am not in that camp because I've never read it.  Maybe I chose something else off of the required summer reading list, or maybe I was just sick that week.  The one thing I did hear people say about this is that it is unfilmable.  This obviously didn't stop Disney from trying... twice.  I am of the mindset that not everything calls for a cinematic interpretation, and even without reading the book, I think this would have been far better off left on the page.  Now given that I do keep my ear to the ground about movies that get released, I was naturally prepared for this to be a train wreck.  I never want to have a bad time with a movie, so I tried to approach this with an open mind.  It was very apparent very early on that everything about this falls flat, and I am struggling to come up with nice things to say about A Wrinkle in Time.  This is a story that is supposed to fill you with wonder.  That never once happens here, and it just ends up being bland fantasy.  The script is pretty weak all things considered, and I had an awfully difficult time giving this my undivided attention at home where I could be making a better use of my time.  None of the actors are ever able to sell it despite earnest efforts, and this has everything to do with the story requiring the child actors do most of the heavy lifting.  I think Storm Reid does have potential, and she is certainly leaps and bounds above the other two lead kids, but she can only do so much with her limited experience.  There is nothing about this movie that gels together with cohesion.  The science behind it all seems to work or not work depending on when the script calls for it, and it really just ends up being an adult looking at children saying, \"that will/won't work right now\".  When that is the forward movement of the story, you can just poke holes in every contrived plot point.  Whenever I started to get into this, I got yanked back out by some pop song that they are trying to sell, and A Wrinkle in Time is as botched as advertised.",

This  movie is so far from how I envisioned the story from reading the book when it first came out - yeah, I'm that old. \n\nMaybe how you picture \"A Wrinkle in Time\" depends on how old you were when you read it, and when. \n\nThis was a book of its time. Even being 8 years old, I knew that part of the shadow of darkness was communism. We had civil defense drills and a missile crises, and we all KNEW that the worst evil we could think of was having the US turn into a Soviet state. Or be like East Germany. Or China. Or Cuba.\n\n No freedom of thought or action, a \"big brother\" (IT) overseeing all of us all the time, and having to comply and conform totally. And no religion allowed (we were told to bury our Bibles to hide them). So that was Camozotz for me - a world like our own - not a magic planet with tornadoes and folding-up houses - that had given in to the darkness of totalitarianism. Where you couldn't be different - have faults like Meg - or love your family - or worship a higher being. It was a scary time - could there be a Mrs. Who or Which or Whatsit to help keep away the darkness? I actually pictured part of the book in black and white - that was what television was, right? - and re-read the book again when a few years later I saw Richard Burton's movie (black & white) of \"The Spy Who Came in from the Cold\". East Berlin = death and darkness.\n\nSo....what to make of the recent \"A Wrinkle in Time\" movie? It's sure pretty - and the message to be yourself and appreciate what you are because you're wonderfully unique - can't hurt. But the movie's just too bright and bouncy and fluffy - like cotton candy. The Mrs.s? In our world they were ugly witch stereotypes (to contrast to their latter gloriousness) - and you had to battle HARD and maybe suffer to fight the darkness - and it was Meg's offering of unconditional love for Charles Wallace - as awful as he was - that saved them -NOT Meg concentrating on how much she was loved - though the statement that Mrs. Whatsit didn't love her was IT's mistake. \n\nFor me, this movie ISN'T \"A Wrinkle in Time\" - it's a feel-good, positive message to kids movie, and an opportunity to travel the universe with some dang beautiful ladies.",

All the things terrible in A Wrinkle In Time 1. The casting was so cheap. (Like Oprah Winfrey is a wonderful actress, but in this movie she is not! I didn\u2019t see Oprah as Mrs. Which I saw her as Oprah Winfrey who decided to play dress up.) 2. The jokes in the movie were cringe worthy. (Like I understand it\u2019s a kids movie but the jokes made me sweat they were so bad) 3. Why is his name Charles Wallace?? 4. TOO MANY CLOSE UPS!!!!!! (Your whole movie does not need to be close ups!! Like give me some space to see the surroundings.) 5. Why is the camera shaking and it\u2019s not a sinister scene??? 6. The CGI was over 9,000!!! (The CGI overpowered the whole movie.) Now let\u2019s list all the good things in A Wrinkle In Time 1. That sandwich in Kamizats looked good. (that\u2019s why I put at least a half star on this movie.) Such a disappointment I mean it took me weeks to bring myself to realize that this is a Disney Movie it was so bad.

The script, plot, and explanation of what was actually happening in the movie was terrible. One of the most poorly written movies I have ever seen. The movie very much seemed to be made strictly just to get famous musicians music into the film. Music was played at odd an unnecessary times. I hope they start making movies again for the audience instead of just marketing and making money. If movies continue to get made this way they will continue to flop. I gave 2 stars for acting and visuals. I do not recommend wasting your time to watching this.",

It is a flawed, but definitely solid adaptation of a basically unfilmable novel and thus quite underappreciated as it is nowhere near as bad as many would say.",

On to the composition of the film itself acting, framing, tone, dialogue, special effects, sound design, soundtrack, pacing, and anything else i missed; all ugly, confused, pretentious, and boring.

It's clear that 10 times more effort, and cash, has been spent on the special effect than the script and the story. The entire enterprise, while looking incredible, is clumsily plotted and emotionally ineffectual. Ava DuVernay hammers in the sentimental moments but does very little to make us care about the characters, and seems more concerned with getting us to the next flashy set piece than creating an interesting story. To be fair, there's not a lot you could do with a script this cliched and banal, featuring a tonne of bland platitudes and uninteresting conflicts. The story is utterly nonsensical, and the rules seem to be made up as the film go along, and even though it doesn't have enough time to make the characters engaging, it does have enough time to turn to Reese Witherspoon into a Pok\u00e9mon and have her fly around a planet for several minutes. It should be noted that nothing is accomplished while on this planet, and they then travel a place to consult a character who advises them where to go next. Shouldn't that have been the first place they went? It's best not to think too hard about it; the filmmakers clearly didn't, and I'm not even remotely surprised that it flopped at the box office. It's all well and good having your movie celebrate diversity and equality, but if your film fails then your message will fail, and A Wrinkle In Time has nothing to say that a million other movies hasn't said already.",

They all did the best they could with what they had to work with, but the story was a mess.  I understand why they did away with the flat planet and my beloved Aunt Beast (although they oddly mentioned her name in a passing image of where the father had been).  The whole thing just seemed like an excuse to use a bunch of over-the-top and unnecessary special effects.  But the story moved too slowly.  It was boring, despite the stunning visuals.  I just couldn't figure out why so much was changed from the book for no apparent reason.  It seems like they could have at least tried to make an adaptation of the book and deviated where needed, rather than make this completely different story that only vaguely resembled the original.

The entire cast is just absolutely stellar and the visuals are beautiful to look at from beginning to end.  My favorite aspect, however, proved to be the drama and emotions it delivered.  I'll put it bluntly, the film was a tear-jerker but beautiful in the way it delivered it.

However, despite the eye-catching gazes and genuine sense of otherworldly surrealism that perpetuates the hearts and minds of all audiences, it's neither a great film within itself, nor is it a great adaptation. This doesn't just account to how many liberties were taken in the adaptation process, but more within the overall story itself. It's perfectly elaborate scale and heart-warming messages kind of want to offer more than what was briefly glimpsed at or even explored in the overall narrative that would have benefited the overarching style of this film willing to be both faithful to it's source material counterpart and creative piece of family-friendly Disney-esque surreal cinema. Thus the overall film offers a decent viewing experience for it's moral/themes and sense of adventure, but doesn't fulfill the greater aspect of it's ambitions nor it's tremendous world-building mechanics to really be very measurable to it's source material counterpart. Recommended with caution nonetheless, especially to those within it's target audience.",

The potential blockbuster had all of the tools for success but fails to deliver due to bad choices in direction and production.

Ambitious and pretentious, I could never by into the premise and found myself constantly ask why and what to most of the basis for the story.\n?A big miss by Disney and Ava should stick to docudramas like Selma and 13th",

Reese Witherspoon's Mrs. Whatsit is perhaps the most whimsical, but apart from her, the lack of subtlety leaves much to be desired from older audiences. Perhaps the least subtle aspect of the film is OPRAH as Mrs.Which, whose literal gigantic presence on screen only serves to magnify the silliness of worshiping at the altar of OPRAH.  The visuals are wonderful, and the acting by most everyone is very good (despite the characters not having that much to do in the movie).

            "content": "I... kind of hated this film, and I feel bad saying that as there are not a lot of films I end up actively disliking upon viewing them.  \"It was different from the book\" is no excuse because it's a film adaptation and some of the best adaptations I've seen take the heart and SPIRIT of a book without strictly following it line to line! This film, however, does the opposite--it removes the best parts of the book and keeps the most weak parts, adding to the weakness and even dragging it out.\n\nYou know the \"happy medium\" that has been pretty universally terrible in every version? Well the actor himself is thankfully more tolerable here but I hope you enjoy watching people struggle to stand on one foot for half an hour (this scene drags on and onnnnnn). Similarly, the magical creature ride on the first planet they get to... in the book at least they had a reason for the ride, to see the darkness and watch light literally fight it off giving you further insight into what sort of wonderous creatures the 3 lady's are and how important the battle is... in the film that is ALL gone and you're left with less than stellar CGI with our characters stupidly grinning in \"wonder\", omg, how magical! Except we're flying for no reason. And there's an action sequence because we were dumb, and that's REALLY what I wanted to see-- Our characters (who are all supposed to be extremely smart) doing STUPID things.\n\nI'm going to have to bullet point the rest of this because I have so many complaints:\n\n* The witches are introduced and are stunning and beautiful the entire film. This is a problem because they're supposed to be seen as quirky homeless-types at the start (the sort of person you might genuinely be concerned your 7 year old is talking to) which makes their later glory/wisdom all the more surprising and meaningful.\n* Talking/moving flowers. Puke.\n* Calvin is useless in this film. The actor does fine (though all he really has to do is smile and praise our protagonist at weird moments). I would have cut film Calvin entirely, he contributes nothing plot-wise or theme-wise.\n* Meg is not portrayed as actually smart, she's just a normal high schooler dealing with the stereotypical high school bully problems. Charles Wallace isn't smart either--but they TALK about how smart he is and we see him drawing so that must mean he's smart, right?! No, that just means he likes doodling like every other kid.\n* Bouncing ball Camazotz  scene: not terrible, actually. But it could have been a lot more unnerving and creepy. It was way too short and transitioned into my next complaint--\n* Beach scene. What the actual heck. Charles Wallace just gets brainwashed... because. Why not  In the book he gets taken control of because he CHOOSES to go to IT, his hubris and feelings of superiority gets the best of him and leads to his downfall. So much more interesting than \"number number, okay, I'm bad now for no reason.\"\n* Meg and her father. I admit that I loved the scene of them reuniting, that was well acted and sweet. But god almighty the movie deliberately chose not to address him leaving Charles Wallace behind and Meg being furious at him because of it. In fact, Meg isn't given a moment of bravery and sacrifice CHOOSING to return alone to try and save her brother, instead she just screams and refuses to get whisked away in the first place. Look, I get time restrictions and all but couldn't you have cut 10 minutes of rock balancing and green creature flying to actually give our characters a meaningful arc?\n\nIn this movie people are special just because people say they are, not because they actually say or do anything special. The whole time I watched it I just cringed or groaned. Heck, I'll even say that the crappy tv movie was better than this one because at LEAST they got some of the arcs right (and I can forgive some bad effects since they obviously didn't have the money).",

The movie lingers on scenes that should have been  much shorter if not cut entirely.

Joined by her precocious whizz-kid brother Charles Wallace (Deric McCabe) and cute-guy-next-door Calvin (Levi Miller), our headstrong but vulnerable protagonist must confront both evil otherworldly forces and her own life-blocking emotions. Aiming to be accessible for younger audiences, the core message - internal growth is impossible without self-belief - is hardly new, but, despite a completely on-the-nose delivery, it's also effective. The connective tissue isn't always the best (the less time spent thinking about plot machinations the better), though there's no shortage of thrills and wonder, or heart wrenching payoffs, in the numerous high-concept set pieces. There are parts of this movie that are unintentionally silly and a few of director Ava DuVerney's stylistic choices are dubious (over-sized Oprah Winfrey? standard black-tentacle incarnation of 'evil'?), yet enough goodwill is generated elsewhere to forgive these missteps. DuVerney doesn't hide her influences either, family classics such as Avatar and Wizard of Oz are obvious touchstones whilst more adult-leaning masterpieces like 2001: A Space Odyssey and even The Exorcist (\"Charles Wallace is not at home right now\") provide inspiration. Reid is an absolute gem in the lead role too, equally convincing in her self-destructive stubbornness to detach from the world as she is in the gradual shift to valuing her strengths, weaknesses and everything in between. She feels right at home sharing the big screen with Hollywood veterans such as Reese Witherspoon and Oprah Winfrey, who, along with comedian Mindy Kaling, play an amusing trio of peculiar beings that guide our heroes on their trek. Ambitious to a fault, A Wrinkle in Time is a family-friendly fantasy saga that wears its heart on its sleeve whilst delivering a visually wondrous, if occasionally scatty, rollercoaster ride.",

Oprah can't act to save her life, but her performance is Oscar-worthy compared to Mindy Kaling's, which has all the dynamic expression of a wet log.  The director somehow even managed to drag all the personality out of Zach Galifianakis.

It is certainly important to go in with a child's wonder, as some of the gaps or character traits are not as explained/fleshed out as in some other movies. However, the multilayered character portrayal of Meg Murray (Storm Reid) is as rich as one could ever hope for, and that, along with the story of her journey, is really what carries this movie.

            "content": "A Wrinkle in Time is director Ava DuVernay's first time helming a large budget feature after her success with 2014's Selma, and it also marks the first time a live-action film with a $100M+ production budget has been helmed by a woman of colour. A Wrinkle in Time is very ambitious and harbours a grand scope with a story that explores the unseen parts of the universe. Unfortunately the execution isn't great and it doesn't leave behind a whole lot to be enjoyed. The plot follows young Meg (Storm Reid) who after the disappearance of her father (Chris Pine) is visited by three mystical beings and embarks on an adventure through the universe to find him. The scope of the story is very large whilst also remaining focused on a small group of characters so despite the fact that it misses beats a lot of the time there is stuff in here I did like. The visuals are a definite strong point, very crisp and clear, and Meg's story actually does have a fair amount of heart and emotion going for it and it helps in offering something to keep you awake. But the negatives heavily outweigh the positives so even when it exhibits good things it still feels held back by everything else.\u00a0\n\n\n\nI'll begin with the characters because where I loved Meg's personal journey through the film and her overall development, I wasn't really invested in any of the other characters aside from how they help Meg grow into her own. The path she takes through here is very engaging and its a journey all about family, love, and accepting who you are on the inside and out so her story individual story has a strong message to it. The relationship with her younger brother and her missing father is a well executed dynamic here and gives the film a lot of heart and a couple of strong emotional scenes you genuinely care about. But all of the other characters don't really have any individual arcs or growth, more or less the people they are at the outset is who they are when the credits roll. They serve their role in strengthening Meg's character but there wasn't really anything about them to latch onto. Her younger brother Charles Wallace played by very well by Deric McCabe\u00a0is the most engaging of the rest of the cast but that's due to his very unique 'out there' personality being quite the opposite to everyone else in here. The three beings played by Reese Witherspoon, Mindy Kaling, and Oprah Winfrey are fine, I didn't really enjoy watching them specifically but they bother me that much. They're vessels used to drive the plot forward and say motivational things to Meg, so they're there but they're not interesting characters.\u00a0\n\nAnd then there's Calvin, Levi Miller's character whose name I had to look up and whose overall purpose in this story is pretty non-existent. He kind of just shows up at one point and joins the adventure but we don't know who he is and it's almost as if Meg doesn't know really who he is but he sticks around anyway. His character just feels so damn forced into this story like he was shoved in just for some sort of clich\u00e9 romantic angle because he doesn't really do anything. And I've got nothing against Levi's performance, I feel like he plays the character as he has been instructed it's just that there isn't a place in the story for him which is why he just floats around. The rest of the performances are all very fine, Chris Pine and Gugu Mbatha-Raw included, it's just the writing of these characters and the way they do or don't play into the story which is very subpar.\u00a0\n\n\n\nThe overall story and physical journey the characters take through the universe fails to be engaging at almost any moment. As I mentioned, aside from Meg's personal story there's nothing of value to really grasp onto. The pacing is completely out of whack, the initial setup moves so fast it's hard to follow and leads to further issues, then later on large chunks of the film slow down to where it occasionally becomes a bit of a bore. The biggest problem stemming from the opening act being so rushed is a lot of the character decisions and reactions to certain events don't come across as very genuine, like the writers have just had characters accept certain things that I'd expect one would be questioning profusely. It also begins at a point where it feels like there's a lot of missing information, especially with Charles Wallace whose journey is already underway when Meg's story begins, some of this becomes clearer with time but it's all still a bit iffy. So many sequences just drag on and slow the film down drastically. For instance, one location they visit where they meet a character played by Zach Galifianakis\u00a0is eternally boring, the film screeches to a halt and it takes a bit to break out of that lull which is a shame. There is an antagonistic presence in here as is expected, but I still don't understand it and exactly what or why or how it is. I won't go into detail about it to withhold spoilers but it's just weirdly conveyed.\u00a0\n\n\n\nSo in the end, Ava DuVernay's first venture into the world of big budget fantasy adventures hasn't really gone to plan but she does some good things in here and she's more than proven her talents as a director in the past so I'm looking forward to her next project. Storm Reid is the strongest link in here and her performance brings a tonne of heart and emotion and beauty to the story where no-one else really does to the same level. Her growth over time is one of only things about the story I could grab onto and enjoy following, but despite it being good it's not enough to hold up the rest of the film. The performances are all fine and the visuals exceptional but with the lacklustre story and characters it's hard to really recommend the movie. As a casual watch I feel there might be just enough in here that a family audience can enjoy but don't expect that exciting of a fantasy adventure.\u00a0\n\n4/10",

That's often noticed in scenes which feature conversations between characters. I felt if I was watching documentary or something, and that made me so confused and I really felt uneasy. \n\nThere are tons of plot holes and unexplained things from the get-go to the end of the movie. But most of the nonsensical things happened to be related to the character of Charles Wallace. Charles Wallace is a very bizarre character. This character and everything related to it don't make any sense ,alas, Charles Wallace is really a big deal in the story and its messy plot. To add insult to injury, the child who played this character, Deric McCabe, is a very bad actor; for a big part of the movie he was trying to act like a cool sweet young kid, but he is not, then we see him overacting. I wonder if this character, Charles Wallace, is also poorly written in the novel? \n\nMrs. Which, Whatsit, and Who characters have many cringe-worthy moments, and I blame no one but the director, Ava DuVernay, and maybe also Mindy Kaling (Mr. Who) who I should blame; what an annoying character and infuriating performance from Mindy Kaling!\n\nI don't have so much to say about Zach Galifianakis or Pe\u00f1a's performances, but I didn't neither like their characters.\n\nI think Storm Reid who played Meg, the protagonist, did a really god job. But the only performance that I can really praise is Chris Pine as Meg's father; he is great and due to his performance, the dramatic and the emotional value, which I didn't get, became slightly better. \n\nThere are very few scenes where the CGI was okay, but, in general, it's weak and cartoonish, and that's due to the bad green screen that is glaringly obvious.\n\nI liked the comprehensive concept of the evil as an antagonist, but what we got from it in the third act was disgraceful! I really suffered while watching this act with all its dull and illogical twists.\n\nI'm very disappointed! I haven't watched many movies that have been released this year, but this is definitely one of the worst.\n\nFrom now on I'll call this movie A Wrinkle in Logic!\n\n(4/10)",

            "content": "The cinematic relationship within an adaptation between a book and a film tends to attract spectators to the film before knowing there's already a book at the first thought. Should I read the book before seeing the film to see whether or not it's a faithful adaptation? Or just go straight to the film and read the book another time? It should be based on the level of your own anticipation towards the upcoming film that you may like to see in the theaters before reading the book.\n\n\"The Martian\" provided an interesting narrative while \"Wonder\" showed a heartening promise, and both films apparently proved to be subconsciously faithful without reading the book. Then there's Disney's latest dive into the fantasy genre as a new film form of imagination that's based off from the pages being transformed under Disney's magical hypnosis effect. \"A Wrinkle in Time\" was earlier compelling, along with a nice set of announced cast, by a possible mysterious concept that may be concerning time travel. But after seeing the film, after being compelled to check out the book a week prior, it may have been a different experience below the initial expectations.\n\nThe story focuses on a young girl named Meg Murry, who been dealing with the disappearance of her father Dr. Alex Murry for five years since he somehow discovered a new planet. Her wandering little brother Charles Wallace meets the mysterious astral travelers Mrs. Whatsit, Mrs. Who and Mrs. Which; then the two siblings, joined by Meg's classmate Calvin, got put into a dangerous journey to bring back their father under the travelers' guidance. It would take the kids' bravery to get through a planet that possesses the universe's evil soul, while the siblings' bond will be put into an eventual test along the way.\n\nFrom what I grasped after the first viewing, \"A Wrinkle in Time\" is rather complex to the meaningful soul mainly by the abrupt folds in the narrative flow, lacking any smoothness for the characters and the overall approach. It's another of those attempts made by Disney to be ambitious only to occasionally falter when created a visionary void with not much to fill the rest for balance that's relied on to the writing and the cast. The descriptive and emotional human soul noticeably provides repetitive moments for the heroine's understanding of the surrounding circumstance with communicated lines that tried to go beyond, only to turn out to be awkward writing.\n\nThanks to the writing, it had affected the nicely-selected cast's somewhat squandered talents, but not their charms when putting literal-balanced energy into their characters. Respectively portraying the astral travelers, Oprah Winfrey, Reese Witherspoon and Mindy Kaling did their best to guide through a fantasy scale while radiating pleasantness in their known presence. Chris Pine energetically performed fine when setting the idea up and trying to put it all to rest. The main, most-energetic spotlight goes to the young stars Levi Miller and breakthroughs Storm Reid and Deric McCabe as they venture throughout the given flow and gave it their best than the veteran actors, though still part of the unbalancing. Simply put, the appealing cast performed decently at the film's average.\n\nDirector Ava DuVernay's intention with this project besides going into the adaptation and having fun along with the rest of the cast is to express a message about diversity and female empowerment, with Jennifer Lee from \"Frozen\" as one of the writers. She did that nicely well amid the visionary void through the characterization under her own spin, especially when providing an insightful understanding as a moral pinch of social commentary salt - hence the meaningfulness. Accompanying that approach next to the characters, along with occasional unique style, is the elegantly fitting music that seems to express the encouraging spirit that composer Ramin Djawadi didn't need to heighten.\n\nSo yeah \"A Wrinkle in Time\" may be questioned regarding its faithfulness to the unread source material as it would take another viewing then a reading of the book to fully grasp it. But as of the first viewing, despite not really being engaging as hoped, it's a decent film for visual entertainment with a subtext in the veins as part of the celebrated soul in reflection form. How flawed it may be at the front with qualities to enjoyably appreciate, it's more important that the cast and production crew had fun doing the project. Otherwise if they didn't, it would be a bad movie. (B)",

This is a challenge with any film relying on child actors, but it was especially brought to light throughout this movie when big emotional scenes were missed due to poor acting.Similarly, the movie missed the mark with the messages it was trying to convey, getting lost in creating nice sound proverbs that main the film feel a fake deepness to it that most children would not understand. I am not a child, so I am not sure how children respond to the film. However, I feel it lacks any true imagination and does not give children anything solid to grasp on to.",

But, the screen presence of Mindy Kaling, Oprah Winfrey and Reese Witherspoon as celestial guides speaking of light, energy, vibes and balance help elevate this Disney sci-fi fantasy into an enjoyable and mystical film that left me with a feeling of exhubeation long after the screening was over.  By responding to A WRINKLE IN TIME in such an emotive manner, I know there are others as well, so I am completely perplexed why this film has a low rating on movie sites like Rotten Tomatoes and IMDb?  The female driven narrative about finding your own light, despite of other people's darkness is a positive message for a younger Disney audience and makes A WRINKLE IN TIME far from a terrible film.",

It makes no sense, is boring, rambles all over the place and everything comes a bit too easily at times to our main protagonist whose performance while good isn't great (though compared to Levi Miller's awful performance she's exceptional).

I'm not sure why we can't just embrace a message of hope and love. We kinda need that these days. The message I took was that the \"It\" - darkness- whispers words of fear and hurt and anger in our ears, and feeds on them. And that we each must overcome our own process of mind to help build light in the larger world. Even as Meg stood facing her brother in the \"darkest of all minds\"...you could see the neurons firing, telling her all the worst she had ever thought of herself. She had to listen to the voices of light to overcome those thoughts, and by doing so she could help Charles Wallace win as well. Beautiful, I think.

It may have been talking about a popular girl struggling with an eating disorder and a great student being bullied by his father to do even better. But for me it looked like a perfect illustration of what has been happening in our world politically over the last couple of years. There were a few more poignant moments in the film. But, unfortunately, just moments. And there was just one character that felt alive - Charles Wallace. He made me cry real tears. Little Deric McCabe outacted a bunch of grownups, some of whom are Oscar winners. Reese Witherspoon, whom I loved in so many different roles, was just all Legally Blonde here. Poor Mindy Kahling was reduced to smiling and saying words that weren't even her character's own. Oprah was being Oprah - no more, no less. Chris Pine was stuck in a permanent state of angst. And Zack Galifianakis made an attempt to liven up his character, but was quickly subdued into a state of permanent soulfulness. It is so sad to see all these great performers acting as if they were making a photo shoot for the movie, not the movie itself. Or better yet - one of those fake rides they have at Universal Studios. In fact, much of the film felt as if they were already thinking about a ride as they were making it. My 9 year old liked it. Hopefully it will make him want to read the book. Then it will be worth it.",

And the worst part is that to make up for those losses, they added in exactly what you wouldn\u2019t expect... Meg trying to balance on a rock for 20 minutes. It was also extremely choppy, moving from scene to scene in a weird and unnecessary way, and focused way too much on the sights and emotional moments to the point that it took away from the whole plot and adventurous spirit the book had. And please, do not get me started with the acting. Instead, I think the words \u201cUnexplainably Bad\u201d can easily make my point.

Worst movie I've seen in a while. Two scary for little kids(demonic possession, child abandonment) No explanation of science, no explanation of title other than a 3 second animation. Terrible attempt at scientific justification for flying was \"lift\" and for getting picked up and thrown by a tornado - \"physics\".  Writers might have attempted to involve a real scientist for the writing. Also these writers should be given an award for worst writing ever.

Visually, this movie had many well-designed scenes and effects.  And from an overall narrative perspective, I felt there was a lot of emphasis placed on making sure the viewer could sympathize with Meg's difficult teenage life.  Therein lies the crux of the movie.  The CGI spectacles and science jargon are really just background material to highlight what \"A Wrinkle in Time\" is really about - the power of love and accepting oneself to make a difference in the world (not about whether girls can do science too or any other mis-guided view of this movie).  Where I get a little hung up on this movie is trying to nail down who is the target audience.  Clearly teenagers, teenage girls, and people who read the original novel are the intended audience; but the spectacle level of this movie seems like it is aiming to reach a broader audience.  I just don't think the casual moviegoer will get much out of the high-minded physics concepts or the fantastical elements which seem oriented toward younger viewers.  And younger viewers are likely to be disturbed by the actions of Charles Wallace and The It at many points in the back half of this movie.  To be honest, the movie reminded me of a mashup between movies such as Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory, Interstellar, and Spy Kids.  As one who formerly read this book I got a fair amount of enjoyment from the movie based on fun character interactions, the inclusion of key elements from the novel, beautiful imagery, and several touching thematic moments which spoke even to me as an adult.  I highly recommend this movie for anyone looking for a movie that explores new worlds, anyone who read the novel, and anyone who enjoys young adult themed books or movies.  For everyone else, check it out for a matinee or rent it later.",

The direction and special effects provide a world unlike any other. This is sure to be a watch for sci-fi fans.\nThe story follows Meg Murry (Storm Reid), a genial teen who is the daughter of famed scientist Alex Murry (Chris Pine). After her father disappears, she goes through a period of insecurity and despair. Four years later, a group of primordial celestial beings - Mrs. Which (Oprah Winfrey), Mrs. Whatsit (Reese Witherspoon) and Mrs. Who (Mindy Kaling) visit Earth to help Meg find her father. Meg's brother Charles Wallace (Deric McCabe) and friend Calvin (Levi Miller) also join the quest to find Alex. However, Meg is also brought in to help fight the \"It\", an entity of darkness that threatens to destroy people's happiness. \nStorm Reid, as Meg, excellently presents her inner struggle to be happy and accept herself and this adds a unique element to the story. As the movie progresses, she slowly rises beyond her doubts to become better. Chris Pine, as Alex, delivers an ardent love for science in his character and, while much of his character is witnessed before he disappears, the rest of his scenes add a performance filled with remorse. Deric McCabe, as Charles Wallace, is my favorite character due to his charismatic performance - full of comic relief. Levi Miller, as Calvin, encompasses a respectful companion who seems to be rather enamored by Meg. Oprah Winfrey, as Mrs. Which, is a wise mentor for Meg who guides her throughout her journey. Reese Witherspoon, as Mrs. Whatsit, is the least wise of the three celestial beings, but she provides a kind companion. Mindy Kaling, as Mrs. Who, represents an encyclopedia of character teeming with knowledge.\nAva DuVernay incredibly directs the movie, as you feel as if you are a part of the world through her use of word building to convey a story. My favorite scene is the resolution to the main conflict, as it feels like an appropriate conclusion. My problem with the movie is that is unevenly paced, with the first half of the movie following generic clich\u00e9s, despite a great first 10 minutes. But the movie gets running as soon as the second half begins, going into uncharted territory unlike any other movie. I also feel that the scenes for Alex and some other plot points are limited, resulting in a few disjointed, convoluted narrative at times and that could throw off some audience members. \nThe message of the movie is about believing in yourself and accepting who you are. I give this film 3.5 out of 5 stars and recommend it for ages 6 to 18. \n\nreviewed by arjun N., kids first! film critic. for more reviews by youth, visit kidsfirst dot org.",

My rating does not reflect the controversies with the book, but just the movie itself. A Wrinkle in Time over foreshadowed the future, and there was no surprise that I was looking for. I can see how some people can connect with the Mrs.'s, but I personally felt relieved when they left the screen. As weird as it may seem, I and many others struggled to connect with the lead characters, despite their similarities to many other people. \n\nIn all, connections were lacking, the theme of the story was an extremely non-risky move, and the rest of the departments in the film struggled to make such a poor idea good.

Meg her Brother and Friend go off on an adventure through time and space to try and find her father.\nThis is a visually stunning film sometimes and then sometimes it is also fairly horrible looking. There is no escaping it, some of the special effects and green-screen are extremely noticeable and they're not quite as impressive as I think this film thinks they are; especially for a Disney production.\nThere are some very touching scenes most of them involving Meg's family, you really do feel a sense of warmth in their household and when her father disappears you feel for character. \nBut from the first act to the third act the story is such a jumbled mess, it felt like the movie was missing something after the touching opening. That was the human touch, after the first act the film was just really a lot of Wow sequences that didn't really land.\nWhen it comes to the Children leading the film all three give good performances for the most part, Storm Reid who plays Meg is fairly good in the movie especially in some of the more emotional scenes, she doesn't really show a lot of surprise when the awe-inspiring moments are happening before her eyes which was a little strange, but she is very good as an awkward young girl who is not comfortable with her own self yet.\nHer younger brother Charles Wallace started off strong then a lot of focus was on his character neither the end and sadly this is where he fell off.\nBut the over reliance of the younger cast pushes a lot of them to one side, some of them just get one or two scenes in the movie which was incredibly disappointing to see.\nI think there's a chance that kids today will see this movie and it will be there Hook, Hook was critically pan by critics in 1991, but kids from that era love it. This could be this generations Hook.",

The constant usage of pop songs throughout actually took away from the scenes after a few times.   The writing was terrible as well, it was so cringeworthy I felt sorry for the actors.  I read the book a long time ago but didn't recall it being like this.  They made the father quite cowardly and I didn't feel any attachment to any of the characters.  The pacing either dwells too much on a lengthy dialogue full of cheese or just jumps all over glossing over plot.   I was shocked upon learning this had a 100m budget.   Either they did not use up the budget or 100mil just doesn't buy what it used too.  In any case, I think a competent director and screenwriter would have accomplished much more with less.

Purists will pounce, often rightly, if the movie fails to stay true to the book. This is the crux A Wrinkle in Time finds itself in, and although it has the ingredients for a great movie, the best it ends up being is a good enough movie.\n\nPeople remember the sense of wonder and imagination the novel inspired in them the most, so naturally, that area is A Wrinkle in Time's strongest suit. Director Ava DuVernay does a commendable job visualizing the majestic worlds of the book. While each scene is shot in a real environment, like the redwood forests of California, the more fantastical elements are recreated through CGI. The CGI blends in perfectly with the live action. Unfortunately, it's also up to the audience to imagine where the characters are, as the editing sometimes loses track of them. On a more subtle level, the costume and makeup design convey the otherworldly nature of the adult characters by changing ever so slightly as the movie goes on. What really impressed me, however, was how the characters are framed. Instinctively, you can tell how they are feeling or whether they are good or bad based on how they're positioned in relation to the camera.\n\nAlthough the movie does a good job adapting that wonder, it's attempt at adapting the story itself is a little more mixed. Personally, I thought the book's dialogue was clunky, particularly in the beginning. For the most part, the script updates the 50 year old dialogue, so the characters speak more like modern audiences. Granted, Charles Wallace still gets called Charles Wallace every single time another character addresses him, but what are you going to do about that? The beginning also spends more time depicting the lives of the Murray family and explores their characters, which makes the decision to cut out Aunt Beast's scene later in the film so puzzling. Given that A Wrinkle in Time has trouble pinning down its pacing for most of the movie, it makes sense to maintain the climaxes' momentum by streamlining it into a single scene, but in doing so, the movie loses a key opportunity to delve into its characters and make their story arcs resonate with the audience. It doesn't help that the themes are sanitized of their religious undertones. On the other hand, the message of diversity that takes their place is laudable. Which is a shame, because DuVernay is a talented director, and Storm Reid shows potential as a child actor. Ultimately, though, A Wrinkle in Time is an OK movie when it could have been a great one.",

Though visually stunning, it feels as if too much information is trying to be crowded into two hours, while upon conclusion, it also seems as if very little has happened at all. If you're a fan of the book or are looking for a feel-good action, sci-fi, and coming-of-age crossover, you may very well enjoy \"A Wrinkle in Time\". Personally, I found the corniness a little too much to handle and would not recommend seeing this film unless you're looking for something to fit exactly those criteria.",

She's shut herself out from others and other kids and adults don't show her much sympathy.\n\tBut soon three magical women show up and they tell Meg that her father discovered a new way to travel to places that are a long way away.  However he gets stuck in that  stuck in that distant place for the past four years.  \n\tMeg and her brother, Charles - along with a friend, Calvin, rush off to a strange and far away land to find and rescue him.\n\tOn the first stop in their journey, the women tell our heroes about a creature called \"the It\" (note: not Pennywise).  This dark mass of ... stuff threatens to turn humanity against itself using mind control and persuasion.\n\tBut Meg isn't leaving without her father - even if she has to face her greatest fears and take on her biggest challenges.\n\nSCORING\nMain Characters\n\tThese three are okay.  I like Meg a lot because she really has trouble keeping it together after daddy vanishes.  But the other two felt really bland in comparison.  I would've like a better explanation as to why Calvin comes along on this trip.  SCORE: 6\n\nSupporting Cast\n\tThe three magical ladies have some flair to them - but they're only good in short bits before they get annoying.  Good thing they bow out of the film early and let the kids shine.  SCORE: 8\n\nPlot\n\tThis film would've been better without the action sequences - like the tornado scene or the beach scene.  And some of the tests really don't make sense - like the taste the sandwiches test.  SCORE: 3\n\nOriginality\n\tThis film has the making of an interesting twist on a sci-fi, psychological movie, but some parts just felt flat - like when Meg finds her father.  SCORE: 5\n\nViolence Factor\n\tThe last scene has Meg getting physically beat up by the It.  It would've been better just to keep it all in her head.  SCORE: 4\n\nOther Moral Issues\n\tThis film is supposed to talk about overcoming your fears - but the message just doesn't resonate because the tests they go through don't really test them very much.  SCORE: 5\n\nFinal Score (out of 60): 31\t\t% Score: 51.67%\n\tThe book's always better than the movie, but this one needed to spend less time with the visuals and more time developing the conflicts between the characters - and the It.",

A Wrinkle in Time is definitely a sight to behold. Throughout the film, the audience is treated to a visual spectacle with panoramic grandeur. At times, the film shines through to deliver to us the message of accepting oneself regardless of what flaws we think we may have and using that power of self worth to overcome the obstacles in life. The film, however, ends up trying too hard to convey that message and it doesn't help having the 3 celestial beings dressed up the way they are with all that makeup which adds a layer of campiness to movie that otherwise wants to be taken seriously. The acting is distracting during certain key moments along with clunky dialogue. While the film is to be commended for aiming high with such a powerful theme, it doesn't nearly reach the heights it was aiming for.",

A carefully reading of the same text might evoke vastly different reactions depending on the readers state of mind and life experience. The same applies to this movie, the creative team had to take a text that explodes in your imagination and define it to set of images and sounds. That will always disappoint some people, because that interpretation might be vastly different than yours. So this is post modern film based on a mortality tale. Will this film be seen in ten years as the definitive portrayal of the book, no. This film might inspire many bright young minds to make great films in the future. I liked it.

The mere fact that this past weekend saw the first time 2 movies with 2 directors of color top the box office is astonishing and inspiring. It's long overdue, and should be lauded. On that note, A Wrinkle in Time is a film that ends up being of far more importance than it does a film that will please most. To say the least, it's a mess.\n\nI walked out of the theater trying to quantify what this film felt like, and I think to me, it's a Disney Channel Original Movie with the budget of your typical summer blockbuster. The budget of a little over 100 million is actually historic, for giving the first black woman a budget that high to direct a film. But that's not even necessarily the problem with the film. The problem lies with the screenplay and perhaps partially DuVernay's direction.\n\nI've never read the book, nor had the interest to, but I have to imagine there was an easier way to adapt this book than the result we got. The story revolves around Meg, who's father has gone missing for years, as she tries to travel through time and space with a few strange beings, her brother, and a new friend from school. Perhaps some audiences, mostly on the younger side, will connect to the story of reconnection and family, but the execution is mind-bogglingly silly.\n\nThere are particular story choices in the 3rd act that are laughably out of place, and even a few blatant mistakes in directing that I never truly could grasp how they got past the editing room. If this were to have come out when I was younger, perhaps it's something I could connect with. But a well-performed and semi-visually impressive film isn't enough to surpass all of the frustrating mistakes in the script and direction.\n\n4.0/10",

The film does a good job in emphasizing family connections and love, and a decent job of making \"faults\" an acceptable aspect of one's self. For kids, it is visually appealing and has some thrill. All that said, something didn't quite come together...it sought to be visually stunning, but wasn't inspiring at the same time, which seems to miss the mark. No matter what, this is an incredible performance by Storm Reid! Reese was expectedly quirky and Oprah maternal/grandmaternal, if not only because she and Storm could--by appearances alone--well be related. Deric McCabe is endearing and believable as a precocious Charles Wallace. All in all, see it, but if will be a movie you see only once or twice. Better in the theater than at home.",

The visuals were spectacular; from the costumes to the hair to the makeup to the beautiful images of flowers and greeny. It was just visually stunning. I liked the fact that this movie really focused on believing in yourself and being a warrior in your life. It's a message that everyone needs to hear nowadays.

Yes this versions Charles Wallace was way cuter, in fact this movie was way prettier and glitzier than the first. Like so much in today's culture. All glitz and glamour and little to no substance.

There is not a single character that I did not hate within five minutes of their introduction. I laughed at the big villain moment because I am not intimidated by five year olds. Itd a movie that attempts to be inspiring and insightful when it has nothing more to say than 'The hippies were right, love solves all the worlds problems'. I can't recommend it on the visuals because the only good visual effects scene was at the end of the movie and the rest of them look like they were done by interns. I can't recommend this movie to parents because the moral of the story - if you can call it that - is that if you just love hard enough, Daddy will come back and the bullies at school will be nice to you.\n\nFor the love of God, capital G divine one-and-only God, do not take a child to see this mpvie. No child deserves to have this inflicted on them. No child needs even the barest hint of the thought that they can make Daddy come back or make solve other complex real-world issues just by loving at it hard enough, because if yiu convince a kid that and loving at it doesn't work, wellI guess that means you didn't love Daddy enough/I guess you're just not loving enough to be treated with basic human respect.\n\nI have a habit of being hyperbolic and exaggerating to make things more amusing but here, now, for thebfirst time in my life I am genuinely just this pissed off at something.

Let\u2019s start with the positives. Oprah, for what she was in during the movie, she did a good job. Same goes with Chris Pine. The movie was mostly visually stunning and had great costumes and hairstyling. Now let\u2019s go into the negatives. The movie was so jumbled around that it couldn\u2019t keep a steady plot. Things would just happen out of nowhere and what bugged me was that characters were just fine with it. None of the characters were too surprised with what happened in the movie. The acting wasn\u2019t that good either. It\u2019s hard with kids so you most of the time shouldn\u2019t have the highest expectations. There was this one kid. He played the character Charles Wallace. My god was he horrible. He was by far the worst part of the film. They really needed to work with his character. There were also some stuff in the trailer that weren\u2019t in the movie which isn\u2019t a good thing in my opinion. There were random pop songs that were placed at totally random parts and weren\u2019t needed. The first half of the first act was good, then it started to get worse and worse. The third act of the movie to me wasn\u2019t good. It was nothing exciting and didn\u2019t catch my attention. I got bored during some parts of the movie. I can\u2019t say the movie was absolutely terrible, but I can\u2019t say I liked it. It was mainly a Disney cash grab that failed at the box office. If you want to see it, go ahead, but don\u2019t expect too much. My Grade: C-",

My position is that if you don't want to do the book on film, but want to use the characters, fine.  buy the rights to the characters, write your own story and make a movie.  DO NOT name the movie the book.   of course, it would rob you of the opportunity to entice lovers of the book into your theaters, but it is the more honest approach.",

I found this movie vitriol to the soul, leading me to suicidal and self-harming thoughts. These emotions were brought up by the fact that the main characters did not smack lips. The result of missing the interlocked lips, i concluded a lower rating i would perceive that this movie is deserving of.\nI am in deep aungish and am in search of a mental hospital or family theripist close to the area around the tesserae due to the deep wounds cut in my flesh from the film. The promised lip - intertwinement i deserved was never offered or given.

So I have to be honest when I say that I was very much let down by this film. Don\u2019t get me wrong, visually it was beautiful and it was definitely moving at times. But that was not enough to make up for what it lacked. Which in my opinion was focus on the overall story as well as context. There just seemed to be a lot missing from the narrative and at times certain things felt glossed over. And that is coming from someone who has never read the book. So I can only imagine how others might feel. Overall this wasn\u2019t a bad film, however the more it sits with me the more I find things to complain about. So I\u2019ll stop here and say don\u2019t just take my word for it, see it and decide for yourselves. Rating: 4/10",

But a terrible screenplay and atrocious editing basically ruin the film (the last scene is a glacially-paced torture of cringe-worthy treacle). They made numerous ill-considered decisions about the narrative that weaken most of the characters in ways that seemed to me completely unnecessary, and - the greatest sin of all, to my mind - they simply do not appear to have trusted the book. And there is too much straight up exposition where one or two hints would suffice. The film's version of the story was flat... it lacked the depth, awe, reverence, humanity, compassion, and \"true-ness\" in the characters' reactions to the supernatural/spiritual forces they encounter that permeated L'Engle's story. The word \"universe\" is thrown about constantly but instead the focus is tight and myopic; not universal at all. I'm so disappointed. I feel like it would have been better if it were not made.",

This was only the second movie I've ever walked out on.. it really was that BAD.  Poor directing, poor acting, poor writing... The actors only live up to the expectations the directors set for them..... In this instance, I'd put the blame for the box office BOMB onto the film's director.

An exercise in doing, saying & being too much, Wrinkle... certainly isn't boring, but it is bad.  \nIt has a lot in common with Tomorrowland: live-action, visually-heavy Disney fantasy-adventures, headed by lauded filmmakers, which celebrate braininess. But where Tomorrowland was simply misguided, Wrinkle... is a straight-up disaster. It gets credit for being Disney's most enigmatic, eccentric experiments in years, taking visual and philosophical cues from Jodorowsky and Kubrick. Unfortunately, all intended awe and wonder is swallowed up by good, old-fashioned ineptness.\nThe story of a girl having to \"tesser\" across the universe to find her long-lost dad gets some things right, including the critical casting of the lead girl. Unfortunately, this engaging young actress can't quite right this time-traveling ship. The rest of the oddly-casted actors certainly don't help. Galifianakis plays a god-like being doing modern, self-aware schtick for some reason (\"I like earthtones.\"); Witherspoon's comic-relief is more annoyingly repetitve than funny; brilliant ad-libber Kaling is forced into delivering constant platitudes; and deus-ex-Oprah leans into stoicism instead of inspiration. \nThese obnoxious side-characters disappear eventually, and the film gets better for it, with potent descriptions of the evil \"It\" and some great, creepy suburban set-pieces. But it's really too late at that point. So much has gone wrong in so many ways (clunky editing, awful exposition, abrasive music, unearned emotions, prescription drug commercial graphics, ill-timed humor, laughable performances, etc), blame must be placed on normally stellar director DuVernay (Selma) for how unwieldy the final product feels.

Aided by vivid visuals, and a host of intriguing characters, Ava Duvernay's film is a unique family film and much darker than most family live action films by Disney. The storytelling is largely visual as the exposition heavy novel gets heavily streamlined in the opening scenes, creating confusion for those who are not familiar at all with the book. Still, the film adaptation won't work on everyone, as its optimistic and thoroughly cheesy hearted spectacle might annoy viewers looking for sophisticated fantasy. As a lover of the book, the film fulfills most of what I was hoping for and it is a dazzling film for brave kids. Rating: 77",

A Wrinkle in Time a fantasy adventure film that is visually beautiful and stunning to look at if you can get by with a plot that seems hallow. I never read the book; I am coming from a fresh perspective on this film. And it is not Disney's worse film like Tomorrowland. The performances were emotional and inspirational. The visual effects were great. But the plot seems thin when you think about it after it is over. It is one of those films that you see once and may not enjoy the experience again. The plot follows Meg (Storm Reid) after years with the disappearance of her father Dr. Alex (Chris Pine). When he was working on something new that can transport a person between space and time to another universe. Meg's younger adoptive brother Charles Wallace (Deric McCabe) is a genius and has been speaking to Mrs. Whatsit (Reese Witherspoon). Mrs. Whatsit tries to recruit Meg, Charles, and her friend Calvin (Levi Miller) to go on a journey to another planet to search for her missing father. What worked great with A Wrinkle in Time? The film's visual effects were spectacular. Meg meets the three ladies Mrs. Who (Mindy Kaling), Mrs. Which (Oprah Winfrey), and Mrs. Whatsit (Reese Witherspoon) and they go to a beautiful planet, were the flowers speak to each other. They fly through a sky from a mystical transformed creature. Then, they travel to a rocky balanced setting, were they meet Zach Galifianakis's character. Then, to a dark place called the it, were all the dark negative energy lies upon. It is a fun adventure to see these beautiful visual effects. Which is also the weakness of this film as well. When the film relies on visuals over storytelling. Storm Reid did perfect with her performance. You grow to like her character. Levi Miller was also okay as well that has an attraction to Meg. Chris Pine was good as her father for the brief moments that he is on screen. Reese Witherspoon and Mindy Kaling were great as well. What did not work with A Wrinkle in Time? Like I said above, the film relying on visuals over storytelling. The movie is all visual effects and there may be scenes were it is overdone. But the plot is thin. It is about a father's passion in discovering new planets in different universes. And the voyage to the unknown. When Meg goes traveling to one visual fest set piece to another. Meeting new characters and getting a lead to another new setting. There is not much of a story when characters are just traveling to another eye candy visual set piece. There is a theme of love in the film. But does poorly on trying to execute a story. Also, I feel like Oprah Winfrey, Deric McCabe, and Michael Pena's performances were just dull. Winfrey as Mrs. Which did not have any depth with the character. Deric McCabe did decent as a genius kid. Michael Pena as Red was just terrible. Overall, A Wrinkle in Time is a fair film. The visual effects are spectacular but overwhelming. The plot is thin and forgettable. Storm Reid was great and some decent performances from the supporting cast. Otherwise, I will recommend the film as a rental unless you are a fan of the book or want to see some stunning visuals on the big screen.",

        {
            "content": "A Wrinkle in Time is based on a beloved children's classic published in 1961. It's directed by Ava DuVernay, who was responsible for Selma, one of the best films of 2014. There's a reason that Marvel offered her the directing gig for Black Panther. This film has big names, a big budget, and big talent behind the camera with a focus on upping the inclusion at the Mouse House... so why is the movie so unfortunately awful? A Wrinkle in Time is one of the worst experiences I've had in a theater. I was so thoroughly unattached that I started questioning how something this bad was so beloved for decades by different generations of, what I must now assume, children with terrible taste.\n\nMeg (Storm Reid) is a teenager still dealing with the pain and anger from the four-year disappearance of her father, Mr. Murry (Chris Pine). He was a scientist trying to discover a new form of space-time travel powered by... love, I think. Mrs. Murry (Gugu Mbatha-Raw) is stuck trying to rear he troublesome daughter and Meg's adopted little brother, Charles Wallace (Deric McCabe). Then one day they and Meg's crush, Calvin (Levi Miller), are visited by a trio of strange, powerful (aliens? witches? fairies? spirits?) women: Mrs. Which (Oprah Winfrey), Mrs. Who (Mindy Kaling), and Mrs. Whatsit (Reese Witherspoon). They inform Meg and company that they know where her father is. They must travel the universe to save him, battle the source of negativity, The It (no relation to Stephen King), and maybe learn a thing or two about accepting one's true self, faults and all.\n\nOprah as Dragonball Z?\n\nA Wrinkle in Time is simultaneously over complicated and meaninglessly shallow. I was baffled throughout the entirely of its near two-hour running time trying to make sense of anything. The story felt like it was written by computer that had been programmed with the scraps of genre storytelling as an exercise. There is no real internal logic that holds everything together, which makes every moment feel arbitrary. The story also lacks another vital aspect every fantasy movie needs - clarity. The goal is for the kids to find and rescue Mr. Murry, but every step leading to this goal feels unclear. Scene-to-scene, moment-to-moment, you don't have any clue how what they are doing will lead them any closer to achieving this goal. Every scene just asserts itself, and then something happens, and then something else happens, and then it's done. Hey one minute the kids are going to talk with flowers because, for whatever reason, they're the little gossips of the plant world. Then Mrs. Whatsit turns into a plant mantis goddess giant. Then the kids hop on her back and fly, and then fly on her while she's also flying, and then one kid falls off, so whoops, but the gossipy plants catch him. And then none of that matters. Even the villain is a nebulous concept of negativity designed to link up with a character's personal journey. There's a plot insofar as stuff happens and then it doesn't. The rules of this universe are never properly established. Anything is just anything in this movie. The final planet, where they do indeed find Mr. Murry, could just have easily been their first stop. If a fantasy movie doesn't properly orient the audience to its world and rules, it's only a matter of time before that same audience checks out, frustrated and uninterested.\n\nAfterwards, I did something I hardly ever do and ventured to read the Wikipedia summary to discover what was in the original story by author Madeline L'Engle. Surely the screenwriters must have butchered this oft-touted children's classic. To my surprise, the summary of the book is pretty close to what ends up in DuVernay's film, with some slight modernizing and name changing (I wonder why DuVernay might not have wanted the Big Evil Source of All Negativity to be called \"The Black Thing.\" Hmmm.). I think maybe the book was never good but was liked by kids, and then they remembered it being better and passed it along to their kids, and so on and so on, until somebody finally runs screaming through the streets, trying to get everyone to realize the harsh reality.\n\nAnother factor that doesn't seem developed or helpful or fulfilling are the three magical beings played by Oprah, Mindy Kaling, and Reese Witherspoon. It feels like they're more award show hosts constantly changing their wardrobes than characters. They offer very Oprah-like self-help platitudes about acceptance, courage, and self-actualization. I felt sympathy for each actress being wasted, in particular Kaling, who speaks only in quotes and a plethora of reaction shots where she practices a wise expression. Witherspoon is definitely overdoing it and Oprah has settled into being talk show Oprah. They felt like rejects from a discarded Alice in Wonderland movie but with less personality. I think you could cut all three out of the film completely. The only meaningful way these three characters impact the plot is as expositional devices, but even that is whimsical nonsense.\n\nSpeaking of exposition, oh boy is this script really bad when it comes to dialogue. There's an early scene that exists purely to inform the audience about the Murry children and to be eavesdropped upon by Charles Wallace (that name deserves to belong to a tax attorney or a serial killer). \"She's smart but hasn't been the same since her dad left,\" says one teacher. \"Yeah, but that little brother of hers, he's got potential but he sure is weird.\" The conversation feels painfully inauthentic and transparent. Don't these teachers have other students of equal interest at the school to discuss? The Murry children's father disappeared four years ago and they're still talking about them this sloppily? The final film is stuffed with these moments, with characters transparently telling the each other who they are or how they should feel at all times. The pointless romantic sidekick, Calvin, is literally introduced as coming over and saying, \"Hey I sorta know you from school, and I felt like I should be here,\" as if he could feel the screenplay calling him. Also, Meg just happens to live next door to her chief bully in school, who is still bullying her every day for whatever reason. It's been four freaking years since her father left, and apparently this still offends this girl on a daily basis? Most of the dialogue made me wince.\n\nIt will sound mean but we need to talk about the bad child acting in A Wrinkle in Time. In the modern age, after Room, It, and The Florida Project in particular, there really is no excuse for bad child acting. If you cannot feature quality child actors, you aren't looking hard enough or that may be a fault of the director's own abilities. McCabe (Stephanie) is, in particular, a bad choice to carry much of the movie's emotional climax at the end. He even gets possessed by the Bad Negative Force and must channel menace. It comes across more like a petulant child throwing a temper tantrum in a store. Much of the conclusion hinges on tight close-ups of McCabe bellowing. It's unfortunate for everyone. Reid (12 Years a Slave) fares a little better but is relatively inexpressive, going even beyond the general withdrawn nature of her character. Miller's (Pan) character serves no purpose. He offers no skill or breakthrough for the plot. He is just there, blank-faced, and providing PG-rated prepubescent romantic tension. Or perhaps Meg really needs to hear the strong encouragement from the voice of an attractive white male in order to finally personally succeed?\n\nDuVernay's direction has some nice, sweeping visuals but the movie as a whole feels far more awkward and misapplied with its budget. Some of the special effects are shockingly shoddy for this kind of major release from Disney. The fantasy worlds feel like holdovers from other fantasy movies with little memorable distinction. There is one effective moment visually that stands supreme, and that's when the trio encounter a suburban neighborhood populated with Children of the Damned-style kids all bouncing balls in sync. Their individual mothers come out and march in the same eerie synchronicity, and it's the best-conceived and executed piece in the film. It's also one of the few sequences where the editing is a benefit. The editing is conspicuously poor. Early on, when Mrs. Whatsit had first introduced herself, every cut failed to match, every camera movement created a disconnect of space, and it generally felt off. It didn't get better from there. When you notice the editing, unless you're in a Scorsese or Aranofsky movie, it's a bad sign.\n\nIn many ways, this film reminds me of the misguided, flabbergasting, and fascinating failed passion project that was 2014's A Winter's Tale. I could dissect that movie and its multitudinous of wrong-ness for hours. With A Wrinkle in Time, I just wanted to leave. I wanted to enjoy the movie and root for DuVernay being given the reins of a major studio film. I loved Selma and diversity behind the camera is hard to come by in Hollywood, let alone a woman of color given this sort of platform. Sadly, it feels like DuVernay wasn't quite ready. A Wrinkle in Time gave me nothing to engage with early on. I didn't care about the characters, the plot felt like it was being made up as it went, the rules were unclear, the dialogue was inauthentic, there was no sense of momentum, and when it does accidentally stumble into something slightly interesting, it quickly moves along again. It's about the power of love overcoming the power of negativity. I don't know whom this movie is for. Children will be bored. Adults will shrug. This movie doesn't work on a fundamental level and it left me bored. I closed my eyes and dreamed of a better movie but it never came to be. My dear father, who had the misfortune of enduring this experience with me, turned to me during the end credits and said, \"I am now going to treat you... by taking you far away from this movie.\" It's that bad, folks.\n\nNate's Grade: D",

It was my first \"novel\" so to speak, even if it was geared somewhat toward younger readers.    Not that Madeleine L'Engel didn't propose some silly ideas in her book  (defining the \"Mrs.'\" characters as former stars didn't make sense even when I first heard it, but it didn't take away from the overall imagery and storyline), but as usual Disney Studios have a way of sanitizing, omitting and ultimately ruining this adaptation a second time, after an even worse earlier version that was so bad I couldn't believe it.    We don't expect movie scripts unless they're bios or historical to follow to the letter the books they use for their movies, but this is ridiculous.    There is no mention of the Murry twins, Sandy and Dennys, who would be in a book of their own later.    Charles Wallace was not adopted, and Meg's father disappeared as a part of a military experiment with several other scientists, and they were not part of NASA.    Further details include the \"Mrs.\" Whatsit, Who, and Which as young, and Whatsit a young first time whatever she is, which is the opposite of her book personality, very very old, as are the others.    In fact, in the book, while Mrs. Which is the strongest of the three, she barely if ever materializes completely, and then in a typical witch form.    But Disney really blows it as their version of Meg and Charles Wallace are so far from the book characters it's maddening.    Meg was angry - smart, and much more impetuous in the book, and Charles Wallace was more vulnerable, and likable.    The boy playing him does okay, but comes off as a young smartass most of the time.    The worst thing they did was screw around with Camazotz, a planet controlled by an evil entity called It.    It didn't suddenly change backgrounds like the movie claims.    The cul-de-sac with the automaton children did not convey the sinister behavior of It controlling their every breath and movement, along with the rest of the city where the kids had to go to find Meg and Charles Wallace's father.    The book had a far more sinister feel - all identical buildings that didn't fold up, then to apartment style buildings as they neared the city center, and finally the skycrapers, all identical, except for the monolithic CENTRAL Central Intelligence building, higher than any building on Earth and just as wide and deep.    Here is where the Man With The Red Eyes encountered them, not on a beach with a stupid Wizard of Oz reject who takes them to a single room instead of the great building.    Believe me - the millions of us who loved the book I'm positive thought these plot aberrations were silly and distracted from the menace of the story.    Your kids might think it's okay, but I hate this movie.    It fails every which way to convey the dangers of the book, removes the cold sinister feel of Camazotz, and falls woefully short of doing the classic book justice.    Maybe if some film company besides that lukewarm Disney could give it a go, but I doubt anybody will.    Not even Chris Pine or Reese Witherspoon can save this dog.",

This film had to have been a turning point for her career, a defining moment for an African-American female director leading a huge 100 million dollars production but the result is perhaps the first great disappointment of mainstream cinema in this 2018.Frankly I don't think it's the disaster that many people have said it is, but it's a film that lacks of direction. Visually is beautiful but it has a formation and rhythm that affects the development of the whole film and the truth is that it ends up consumed by its own ambition.

Which I can respect. But here's the thing...it is true that black girls deserve a film like this. But they also deserve better! They do not deserve a poorly acted, poorly written, safe, pandering, no stakes film that is only made to make a franchise that this pap is! Like this is really bad and the fact people are seriously giving this film a pass for **** identity politics makes me sick! That's not moving forward, that's blatant tokenism and I will not stand for it!The acting is all around awful! And I do not mean from the child acting, which yes they are terrible! Storm Reid is wooden, Pan survivor Levi Miller is awkward, and Deric McCabe honestly feels like he came from a Disney sitcom (he wasn't, but still my point stands). But honestly I think they might be better than the adult acting, which outside from Chris Pine (who is too good for this movie) and Reese Witherspoon, is just embarrassing. Oprah is underacting, which is surprising from a force of personality like her, Mindy Kaling is miscast and flat as hell, Zack Galifianakis is not even trying, Michael Pina is only in this film for like 5 minutes and even then he's just awkward, and Gugu Mbatha-Raw outside of one scene is just terrible.I cannot believe Ava DuVernay directed this, and I mean I legit refuse to believe she did because this feels like a half assed studio directed job. Some of the shots are decent, but she was the wrong choice for this. The movie needs to have a surrealist touch like Terry Gilliam or Alejandro Jodorowsky, not someone who is known for making grounded, serious dramas like Selma and Middle of Nowhere. There are a few shots where she is close to that, but overall this film feels lazy from a directorial standpoint. And speaking of lazy, holy **** the green screen compositing is dreadful! Like some of the worst from a major motion picture that I have ever seen all year! The worlds the characters go to look great, but it is so clear that they are on a green screen set and not in these beautiful planets. This cost over $100 million and it is flushed down the drain!But I do not blame DuVernay for this. I blame it squarely at Disney! This is the second the titular book was adapted from the company, the first being a terrible made-for-TV adaptation from the early 2000s, and it is clear that they are going for yet another high concept adventure film like John Carter, the Lone Ranger, and Tomorrowland, desperate for another Pirates franchise. They should stop because they all are box office disasters! I remember reading the book but barely remembering a large portion of it, but what I do remember is one scene where the main girl sees the life of her love interest (who A, just pops in and have no real reason to be there other than he just tagged along, and B, they have no chemistry what-so-ever) and she sees that his mother abuses him and his siblings, which was a huge moment because this perfect guy has his walls broken down and seeing what he considers a flaw. That never happens in this movie. They completely brushed it aside because that might be too much for families and it will hurt their FEE FEES. What I am getting at is that there is no sense of danger in this film. Even if the visual effect integration was amazing, I would never feel that there was a sense of tension with anyone. They always end up just fine in the end. Like there has to be any sense of grit or an element of stake in a movie to has the audience care, but if nothing bad ever happens to them besides forced conflicts in the third act, then why should I bother caring. Like I said before I don't blame DuVernay for this because more than likely this was micromanaged to **** by Disney to make the safest, cleanest, non-threatening film they could. It's the equivalent of dangling keys in front of the audience, along with poorly integrated pop songs (all originals and all awful) or a cheap and bland movie score.I remember hearing that the author of the book wanted to make a book that was about exploring complex themes of physics to young readers so that they can understand, but that barely gets addressed, or whenever it does the dialogue is so poorly written that they just flat out spell it out to the audience. The writing in general is dreadful, watering down any element of the book to cringe-worthy lines about love and weird gibberish that Oprah mumbles out of her monotone mouth.Like how the hell can you make a big budget blockbuster worse than the lame made-for-TV film made over a decade ago? Clearly Disney found a way with their toothless, virtue signal of a film!",

The only reason I watched the whole thing was because I wanted to see how the kids find their father by just walking through the entire universe. Supposedly he had been missing for 4 years and was found crouched down in some tunnel. How long was he there for? Well, he looked pretty healthy and sane and clean for someone lost in the bad part of the universe with absolutely none of his basic needs met, like food or water. I liked the character of Meg and the girl who played her did a great job considering the terrible script. But that was the only character. The rest were absolutely ridiculous. Why keep casting the same faces over and over and over and over again? None of the dialogue or silly quotes made sense. As for Calvin, that was just total cringe. This \"gorgeous guy\" just happens to come along for this bizarre ride, just for the sake of trying to turn this movie into a romance somehow? Stop leaving out substance and realism and replacing it with corny romantic possibilities Disney!

That's often noticed in scenes which feature conversations between characters. I felt if I was watching documentary or something, and that made me so confused and I really felt uneasy. There are tons of plot holes and unexplained things from the get-go to the end of the movie. But most of the nonsensical things happened to be related to the character of Charles Wallace. Charles Wallace is a very bizarre character. This character and everything related to it don't make any sense ,alas, Charles Wallace is really a big deal in the story and its messy plot. To add insult to injury, the child who played this character, Deric McCabe, is a very bad actor; for a big part of the movie he was trying to act like a cool sweet young kid, but he is not, then we see him overacting. I wonder if this character, Charles Wallace, is also poorly written in the novel? Mrs. Which, Whatsit, and Who characters have many cringe-worthy moments, and I blame no one but the director, Ava DuVernay, and maybe also Mindy Kaling (Mr. Who) who I should blame; what an annoying character and infuriating performance from Mindy Kaling!I don't have so much to say about Zach Galifianakis or Pe\u00f1a's performances, but I didn't neither like their characters.I think Storm Reid who played Meg, the protagonist, did a really god job. But the only performance that I can really praise is Chris Pine as Meg's father; he is great and due to his performance, the dramatic and the emotional value, which I didn't get, became slightly better. There are very few scenes where the CGI was okay, but, in general, it's weak and cartoonish, and that's due to the bad green screen that is glaringly obvious.I liked the comprehensive concept of the evil as an antagonist, but what we got from it in the third act was disgraceful! I really suffered while watching this act with all its dull and illogical twists.I'm very disappointed!

Both movies do have Oprah in them, though, that's for sure. It's  honestly been a long time since I've seen such an immeasurably dumb, narratively tone-deaf movie backed by a studio with such confidence. There's such an impossibly small amount of sense in this story that it's actually hard for me to believe some sort of snafu didn't happen between the Disney executives and the creative minds at hand.

I have not read the book \"A Wrinkle in Time\" but the person I saw this movie with did, and they disliked it even more than I did.This film has a lot of problems. The biggest problem is that the script makes no sense. Nothing is explained, the plot jumps around everywhere, and the word \"universe\" is said probably 80 times in the first hour. There's a cheesy \"be yourself and believe in yourself\" message that feels tacked on, and not truly genuine. Character motivations aren't really discussed outside of Meg's, and the pacing is diabolically bad.The direction is not much better. Some of the visuals actually look really bad. My two favorite shots of the film were Meg's room at the beginning, and the reunion between Meg and her father. Unfortunately this is not Ava Duvernay's best work at all.The acting is all over the place. Charles Wallace and Meg are fine, but Calvin is the most wooden actor I have ever seen. The talents of Oprah Winfrey, Chris Pine, Reese Witherspoon, Mindy Kaling, and Zach Galifianakis are completely wasted. Chris Pine also does this weird face through the whole movie? You'll see what I mean.I knew this was going to be bad when the theater showed a trailer for \"A Wrinkle in Time\" before the movie itself started playing. Skip this one.

When yoga therapy with a cave-dwelling guru doesn't lead to the answers you're seeking, sheer desperation will light the way.4. When your desperation leads you into the path of a tornado spawned from the Matrix, outwit it with your superior knowledge of aerodynamics and the pattern recognition skills you no doubt honed while playing endless hours of Cuphead.

Tellingly, the three Mrs. W\u2019s have been translated here into a trio of intergalactic glamour-pusses, characterized primarily by their outward appearance, costume changes, and connection to pop culture. Such materialism is perhaps necessary when translating a largely abstract novel to the screen, but when overdone, as is the case here, it becomes distracting rather than illuminating. I\u2019d recommend this movie for DuVernay or Disney diehards and tweens in desperate need of a crash course in standard self-esteem and lowest-common-denominator courage. For everyone else, skip the movie and read the book. Your own imagination will surely create something better. (And you can always go ahead and download that new Sade song.)",

All the big name actors who play the alien beings did a great job. In fact, this was probably my favorite performance by Reece Witherspoon as a weird, unintentionally rude alien. Visually, the effects, the costumes, and sets are all a joy to watch. Lot of creativity there.In fact, I liked the second act. The focus on the aliens and other planets are when things got good.

Nope! I don\u2019t think so, miss \u201cgive me a paycheck and send me home!\u201d I\u2019ll demonstrate how it\u2019s done:A black hole of an experience, despite its hard attempts to look indigo fresh, all hope loses its way in A Wrinkle in Time\u2019s milky world dyed by the residue of Lucky Charms marshmallows. Thru each overly long scene, the dreadful dialogue literally spills down excessive messages, even letting the radio hand out plot information. Believe me, you\u2019d rather be marooned on an island of tan sand than suffer through such awful sound editing throw in dialogue at random, as is done here.Like similar kid/teen movies, a romantic side plot attempts to glitter up a bond between the protagonist, Meg, with a guy she just met that day, Calvin. It may top Twilight in its love story, yet still falls way short beneath Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet doing you-know-what inside a peach in Call Me by Your Name. Worse, Meg\u2019s treatment may turn any parent hot-red, because she somehow sees a new boyfriend she knows nothing about as a symbol of success, completely contradicting the independent woman image Disney intended.Now, its core message does give a decent moral takeaway: generosity delivers greater rewards than material rewards, since the grass may not always be greener. However, in scene one, Meg receives from her father a decorated origami representing love\u2019s eternal omnipresence, which could\u2019ve been a powerful image, yet it never appears again. This could\u2019ve helped kids differentiate between symbolic light and darkness, but the writers used zero grey matter to keep anyone older than twelve from boredom. In further speculation, Meg\u2019s father also left their sepia-tone family photo to follow his own desires after the universe\u2019s secrets, eliminating any sympathy in such a selfish man, no matter what the script wants you to feel about him.Some Blacks might find some empowerment by seeing a young Black girl achieve scientific explorations, although its focus misses the mark. When Meg slumps around school on the four-year anniversary of her father\u2019s disappearance, some popular White girls write on her locker \u201cIf only you\u2019d disappear to.\u201d Why? Where did those girls\u2019 cruel motivation originate? Race? Popularity? Brown-nosing? WHAT?! Little details like this throughout the film are rarely, if ever explained for clarity.Book fans may particularly feel quite blue from the careless spectacle-over-purpose adaptation process. To its credit, art director Naomi Shohan (American Beauty, The Lovely Bones) does achieve to create a destructive, infinite environment that towers above the heroes in an amber crystal cavern, then she counteracts that with a blanketing hallway coded in fresh hues of magenta and orange, which reflect back to some key shots in Alejandro Jodorowsky\u2019s The Holy Mountain. Though everything still looks cheap, such as Meg, Calvin, and Meg\u2019s brother, Charles Wallace\u2019s flight on Mrs. Whatsit above the emerald and sapphire CGI landscape. Some wind kicks them up, so they appear to fly themselves\u2026 beneath an obvious sight of digitally removed copper wires\u2026 in front of a green screen that blurs out their outlines.Other left out details in the book include:Mrs. Who doesn\u2019t turn invisible.Instead of a winged horse, Mrs. Whatsit turns into a giant jade artichoke behemoth.Aunt Beast is left out.Instead of a brain, the \u201cIt\u201d takes the form of a colorless alternate dimension.But the disloyalty to the source material isn\u2019t the worst part\u2014it\u2019s the performances free of any silver lining. This casting disaster\u2019s nonexistent pacing moves slower than a periwinkle at full speed, impossible to soothe by a lavender scented candle. The cringeworthy kid actors are the worst; Levi Miller\u2019s (Calvin) screen presence has perhaps gotten worse since he starred in the overly saturated flop Pan, but no worse than the bothersome Deric McCabe (Charles Wallace), a perfect example of an unfunny overactor.The three audience-bait women pain your purple veins to watch too\u2014worst one being Reese Witherspoon; just\u2026 UGH!!!! She puts on her own show for a bronze metal by shouting her lines too fast against the momentum of her exaggerated hand motions that bulge out her eyes. Plus, Zach Galifianakis (Birdman, The Hangover) plays the Happy Medium without a hint of a golden sunshine smile.See? To speak color, all you need is some clever writing, an imagination, and a furious vigor against an atrocity which failed in the things I just listed.",

Neither I or my lot have read it so I can only judge based what we saw on the screen. Technically good. Visually very colourful and warm if  bland.The lead Meg Murry was very competent especially at the beginning when interacting with the weirdly unpleasant adults at her school. Charles Wallace( Two names?) did his very best but the director asked too much of him. The adult actors (more than a few big stars) were OK though Oprah's enormous (literally) presence detracted from even kid's suspension of disbelief.The narrative was a little confused to put it kindly. The director Ava DuVernay is a political animal not apparently suited to fantasy.Still the strong message of love and kindness as the ultimate family value is always appreciated in my book",

The story had been adapted prior in a 2003 television movie but this time out the scope is much larger as are the names associated with it.The story follows a young girl named Meg (Storm Reid), who has withdrawn following the disappearance of her father (Chris Pine), four years earlier. Her brilliant adopted brother Charles Wallace (Deric McCabe) is very protective of Meg and wants to help ease the suffering she has endured over the loss of their father.Enter the quirky Mrs. Whatsit (Reese Witherspon), who Charles Wallace has been talking to unbeknownst to his family who in turn seem taken aback by her arrival and strange nature.  Charles Wallace soon introduces his sister and schoolmate Calvin (Levi Miller), to Mrs. Who (Mindy Kaling), who also shares some unusual quirks as well. With the arrival of the final piece in Mrs. Which (Oprah Winfrey), the children are whisked away to another planet on a search to find the missing father and help restore light to the universe from a dark threat that endangers the universe.What follows is a series of adventures, quirky characters, and bright visuals as the children and mysterious strangers embark on a grand adventure.The cast is very appealing but I would love to know if the three stars filmed their scenes at the same time as it did appear at times if they were added in post-production as they did not seem to have much direct interactions with one another. The film does tackle some deep and at times dark subject matter which may be a bit much for younger viewers. One would think that Quantum Entanglements and folding space would be subjects more likely found in Star Trek vs a family film but the film does have some good messages and themes which are essential for younger viewers to note.The film moves at a deliberate pace and does not erupt into overblown action sequences so viewers expecting a rousing action/adventure will need to temper their expectations.For those looking for a film with an empowering message aimed at younger viewers, than \u201cA Wrinkle in Time\u201d, may be just the thing for an enjoyable family outing to the local cinema.3.5 stars out of 5",
