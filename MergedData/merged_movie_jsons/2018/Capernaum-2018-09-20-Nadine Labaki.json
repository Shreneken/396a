            "content": "\"Capernaum\" is a very unpleasant film that deals with very unpleasant situations and people. Because of that, it's not a film for kids to watch and I don't recommend anyone suffering from depression watch the movie....it's very hard to take and is brutal in its realism.The film is about a 12 year-old named Zain who lives in Lebanon and who physically looks like a 9 or 10 year-old...possibly because of malnutrition. The film begins with the boy in prison for stabbing someone and his parents have been called back to court because the boy is now suing them for bringing him life. The film then is a series of flashbacks which show how neglected the boy was. It became so bad that eventually he is taken in by an illegal alien and he takes care of her baby while she goes out looking for any work. Later, when she disappears, Zain continues caring for the baby and trying to work at the same time. It's a miserable existence and you know eventually it will end in violence.This film was made with a minimum of dialog and a plot that is hard to see without the story tearing at your heart. It's one of the more unpleasant movies I've seen in some time and implies many things that aren't overtly stated, such as pedophilia and other ghastly crimes. Hard to take...so much so that although it's an excellent character study, it's the sort of film few would really want to watch in the first place.",

            "content": "Watch this and you'll never feel poor again. You might even appreciate every single thing you own.Wow, this movie set in the slums of Beirut, Lebanon, did a 180 on me. The entire movie revolves around the main character, child, Zain - maybe 12, maybe 13, but wise beyond twice his maybe age. At first, I didn't care for him. He seemed always angry, cross, mean and rude. I just accepted this is the character the movie's about.Well, then the 180 degrees SLOOOOWLY, but surely kicks in. It takes a lot of patience, attention and definitely reading to see why he's like what he is and it may break your heart.Zain has an infinite number of brothers and sisters and some ruthless parents. The one Zain loves and cares for the most, his 11-year-old sister, Sahar and is being courted by a full-grown man. Just as Zain is about to run away to save Sahar, she is, in fact, sold/bartered to the man to be his 11-year-old wife. Unable to save her Zain just leaves.That's all just the setup, as not the movie kicks in with his journey, observations and inability to take care of a baby he ends up with. And there's much more. Believe me when I tell you I've only told you 10% of the plot just so you know what you're getting into.Wow, this movie was heartbreaking, uplifting from the boy's plight and scary this could/probably does happen. That 180 turnaround I spoke about: well, I ended up loving this kid. Pitying him, definitely, but he's more MAN at 12 or 13 then most adult men are.Highly recommend this movie. Use this as birth control. No one else seems to be getting the message.***Final thoughts: Beirut, Lebanon's been in the news lately from their nuclear-sized blast. While this isn't a pretty movie by ANY means, at least it's an uplifting tale of someone speaking out against the wrongs of some its people. Wish people would hear this message, but sadly, unlikely.",

            "review_title": "The Best Foreign Film Ever Made?",
            "content": "I have taken so long to review this film because it has had so much of an emotional effect on me. It was also the first film I saw at AFI Festival and since I was genuinely shocked at how bad the subsequent films I saw there, I decided to get those out of the way first.Well, here I am, giving my review on the most heart-wrenching yet most beautiful film I have ever seen. The \"acting\" was absolutely extraordinary (standouts are from a young eleven year old boy and a one year old baby). The score from the director's husband happens to be one of my favorite pieces of music from the decade. The cinematography manages to take some of the most disgusting places in the world and manages to give it beauty, especially through the gorgeous landscape and aerial shots.Coming from a Lebanese female director, Capernaum is a film that discusses a variety of issues, but I will try to make it as simple as I can. In the present day, our main character, eleven year old Zain is a boy currently serving a sentence for stabbing a man. Through certain circumstances, Zain is able to take a break from jail to partake in a court case against his parents, where he is attempting to sue them for ever having him in the first place and to urge them to never have kids again. Through a series of flashbacks, we get to see Zain suffering in his large family of about seven to eight, including sisters of all ages, and two horribly misguided parents. The parents struggle financially, forcing their children to work long hours and never partake in school. The parents also abuse Zain for being extremely rebellious in nature (think of Rebel Without a Cause) and they starve him a lot. There is a lot of family issues here, but over the course of the film, Zain experiences a journey of a lifetime, running away from home and trying to make a life for himself, living life on the streets. Regardless of the amount of suffering Zain goes through, he delivers an utmost love and care for everyone around him.Capernaum is an extraordinary film that won my heart in every way. It depicts the harsh realities of the children living in squalor in Lebanon, and perhaps in all of the Middle East. Filmed as a narrative, Capernaum actually uses real life Syrian refugees and kids who were all going through extremely similar circumstances to the ones found in this film. The director and her husband were their following the screening, and they really emphasized how they spent 100s of hours in Lebanon, ensuring that they experienced the squalor themselves and the interviewed hundreds of children to get an idea of what life is like there.The common theme: \"I wish I never lived\" or \"I wish my parents never had me.\"The director took those two most common statements and developed a powerful film that gives humanity to these children who need it most. Perhaps the themes of love and compassion amidst squalor and pain could be a guiding light to all the children who are suffering in the foster care system or are getting abused here in the United States as well. I just hope Capernaum spreads awareness to all people throughout the world that child abuse is still rampant throughout the world, and all children want to be is loved. All people want to be is accepted and have a home. All people just wanted to be treated like a *queues Tommy Wiseau's voice* human being.Honestly, I am proud to say this is currently my favorite film of all time. At two and a half hours long, I was begging for more at the end. Bring lots of tissues, but also do not be afraid to let loose and laugh a little.Regardless of all the positive reviews for Roma, I am going to be rooting for Capernaum to win Best Foreign Film at the Academy Awards. This experience changed my life, and I hope it does for you as well.Fun Fact: The original cut was ten hours long.Another fun fact: This received a 15 minute standing ovation at Cannes Film Festival, and it was well deserved.",

The actors don't feel like they're acting (to some extent they're not), it feels like a reality, their innocent eyes describing a journey most of the world was unaware of.I want to recommend this to everyone, but if you're at a low point in your life or show signs of depression, avoid it, you suffer enough.

            "content": "Capharnaum - The MovieNadine Labaki always astonishes me with her work and this is actually my first time ever to write a review about a movie. But this... this is a masterpiece...Capharnaum managed to stir my emotions, it awakened my mind to things we see on a daily basis but decide to ignore. It was a big slap in the face, to be honest. As I watched, I hated myself for having food and shelter. I hated the fact that I paid 14.000 LBPs for my own pleasure and enjoyment to watch a movie. I hated the fact that I bought a $1 worth of pop corn for $7. Why do I get to enjoy a three-hour movie whilst others need that money for a three-day food supply? For those who still haven't seen it, it's a story of a supposedly 12-year old boy who gets sued for stabbing a \"son of a bitch\" (as the boy, Zain describes him). It depicts the life of a typical Lebanese poor family, only if the word poor was enough. It portrays how they eat, how they dress, how they talk and behave and what they do for a living. It was so REAL that I thought it was actual footage from Zain's life. The movie also displays the life of an Ethiopian woman who has no permit and who was knocked up by some guy and gave birth to a baby she can barely support. Oh, speaking of the Ethiopian woman; I was meaning to mention, as soon as the movie starts, we see Zain at court and then we also see the Ethiopian, Tegist with tears in her eyes while waiting for Internal Security to call out her name. At this point I'm really curious as of what this is going to be about and some guy behind me makes a \"funny\" joke about the scene saying \"oh, so the Ethiopian is the star of the movie?\"... I don't know why but I thought I'd mention that because it left me in shock... we'll get back to that later. Capharnaum addresses poverty, illiteracy, ignorance, cruelty, racism, unawareness and child abuse. On the other hand, it also addresses kindness, innocence, forgiveness and faith. It is just amazing how Zain worked so damn hard to support Tigest's baby all alone while his parents didn't have a care in the world for their own children. A 12-year old boy taking care of a baby was just so heartwarming and beautiful. \nZain's personality is amazingly complex and in him one can touch awareness and illiteracy at the same time. Innocence and violence. Politeness and insensitivity. Good and bad. Love and hate. \nHe had a vision, he had a message. \nHis message was bigger than governments and countries. It was bigger than you and me. It was a message that we decide to laugh about instead of help spread. The message is simplified in one word: AWARENESS.About the guy I mentioned earlier, lets hope he has learned something from the movie...Lets make this movie our prayer before going to bed every night... Then, we could try and change the world to the better.Nadine Labaki keeps on dazzling us with her great work... I can't wait for the next one. We, as Lebanese, are so proud of you. And the whole world should be. Much love.",

There have been images of people trying to cross the Mediterranean Sea, or pouring into Lebanon and Jordan, or other things like that. The reality on the ground for them is horrible beyond belief. This topic gets addressed in Nadine Labaki's \"Capharna\u00fcm\" (also rendered Kafarnaum, called \"Capernaum\" in English). It concerns Zain, a Lebanese boy who befriends Yonas, an Ethiopian immigrant boy.Shot in a naturalistic style, the movie offers a rough look at their existences. Zain comes from a dilapidated part of the city but has run away from his parents, while Yonas lives with his mother in a cramped apartment. People flee their homes in search of a better and safer life, and then terrible things happen to them in their new homes. It's a heartbreaking movie, and I wholeheartedly recommend it. Let's hope that Labaki keeps making these sorts of movies.No telling how many people this happens to worldwide (and it looks likely to increase).",

            "content": "This movie took my breath away like a punch in the gut.My wife and I have two young boys and are in the middle of navigating the complicated world of grade school. We're constantly left wondering to each other why various parents we know even decided to have children at all for as little as they seem to enjoy them or want to spend any time with them. They act like kids were foisted on them and their job is to raise them into adults as quickly as possible so that they don't have to spend their time on the menial tasks that come with raising young children.That same question -- why do people keep bringing children into this world when they can't or won't take care of them? -- is the central one at the heart of \"Capernaum,\" and it's asked not by another parent, but by a little boy who's old and wise beyond his years and is fed up with his parents and the environment they've created for him and his siblings. The young actor who plays the little boy is astonishing -- I can't remember a movie in recent memory that features such a young actor who so ably carries an entire film. And the film itself is amazing in the way that it pulls forth from the viewer equal parts sadness and rage on the little boy's behalf without resorting to cheap melodramatics or editorials. The final shot of the film had me smiling and tearing up at the same time, and it's one that I will likely remember for a long time.Nominated for Best Foreign Language Film at the 2018 Academy Awards.Grade: A+",

            "content": "This is one of the more disturbing movies one is likely to see. Disturbing in the sense that it reveals the horrendous conditions that people are forced to live in if they have no other recourse. The story follows a twelve year old Lebanese boy, (who quite literally doesn't even know his true age) who has seen enough in his short lifetime that he has no trouble at all distinguishing good from bad. Unfortunately for Zain (Zain Al Rafeea), things are almost always bad, as the story traces his tragic circumstances at home and the way he's forced to use his street smarts to survive in unrelenting chaotic conditions. What infuriated me the most was the extent of human trafficking that the film reveals, which affected Zain's own family and circumstances, to a degree that he lost his own eleven year old sister to a merchant who traded meager security for a youngster he could abuse sexually. I would have been more comfortable with the central character if his upbringing hadn't contaminated him with the obscene language he used in virtually every circumstance, calling his own mother a whore, though her treatment of Zain certainly didn't qualify Saoud (Kawsar Al Haddad) as Mother of the Year. What the story never got around to however, was a resolution to the premise that Zain sued his parents for 'being born'. A courtroom hearing delivered no reprisals against the couple, nor do we learn what happened to the man Assaad (Nour El Husseini), who made Zain's sister an unintended victim. The pathos and poignancy of the story is best expressed in Zain's own words to a mother who held no value for the life her children - \"Your words are stabbing me in the heart\".",

But this is also why we'll react differently to certain things and it's ok. It would be bad if all liked the same things and would not leave any room for discussions - which hopefully are not stretching into fights.

            "content": "It's the missing question in the often heated debates about child poverty - I hear it all the time in my own country (UK) - has it risen? Should the government be doing more to help? How can a developed country tolerate children growing up in squalor? The question that is never asked, that is in fact completely taboo to even suggest, is why are people living in poverty having children? And is that moral?It is the question asked by Zain, the protagonist of this superb film, who decides to sue his parents for having him. Having endured a lifetime of neglect, abuse and poverty he thinks no, and asks the court to prevent his parents from having anymore children.That sets the film rolling, the vast majority of which takes place in flashback as we see how Zain ended up in court. Along the way we see the grim reality of life in the slums of Beirut, as Zain eventually decides to run away after his parents sell off his older (11 year old) sister in marriage to their landlord. He ends up living with an undocumented Ethiopian migrant who lives in a shack with her baby, and Zain ends up looking after the child while the mother works. This provides a counterpoint in many ways to the earlier scenes, as the threesome establish something akin to the warm loving home Zain had never known. But yet again, the films forces us to ask - why has this woman had a child? Though employed, she lives in squalor, and as an illegal migrant her child will never be able to get an education, as a local people trafficker trying to persuade her to sell the child reminds her. Is this moral? Does her right to have a child trump that of the child's right for a decent start in life?The films develops from there, though I cannot reveal anymore without spoiling the final act. Though this isn't really a plot-driven film per se, more a slice-of-life look at Zain and how he deals with the situations life throws at him. This film reminded me very much of 'Salaam Bombay', Mira Nair's 1987 film which deals with street children in Mumbai.It's a brave film and the only other film I can think of which tackles this issue is Ken Loach's 'Ladybird Ladybird', in which an impoverished woman with a chaotic home-life repeatedly gets pregnant. There I think Loach approached his protagonist from a more sympathetic perspective, seeing her as a victim of an unfair economic system and social forces beyond her control. Though I may be misreading her intention, Nadine Labaki takes this further and asks - is it basically selfish for people in these circumstances to have children?Personally speaking - should the government (whether in rich or poor countries) be doing more to alleviate poverty? Yes. Is the economic system both within and between states currently too unequal? Yes. If you are stuck in poverty, dealing with poor mental health, drug addiction, illiteracy, malnutrition, slum-living condition - that sucks, and is unfair. But one thing you should not be doing is bringing children into that situation and thereby perpetuating the cycle of misery. Yes, some children rise above their circumstances, but the vast majority don't, and are thereby condemned to a miserable life through no fault of their own. It's the height of selfishness. This is the provocative question Labaki and Zain pose in this engrossing film.",

Apparently, writer-director Labaki amalgamated the story only from real-life events she witnessed first-hand during her research. It certainly shows and, for me, this information makes everything that much more heart-breaking. It's precisely because it's so real that it hurts so much. This emotional connection is only possible because of a fantastically subdued screenplay, some brilliant direction and typically phenomenal performances from all members of the cast. Indeed, the child actors are remarkably good here, ranging in age from pre-teen to barely out-of-the-womb. It's impressive stuff that solidifies the film as one of the most believable in recent years. The whole thing is just effortlessly engaging, wrapping you up in a relatively small story that usually wouldn't get the time of day it deserves. It may be fiction, but it highlights a plethora of issues that truly plague our world every single day. It's all so domestic and, even, mundane, too. It's just a slice of life that we usually don't see. It's great. 8/10",

            "content": "Travel the slums of Beirut with 12-year Zain (Zain Al Rafeea), who is suing his parents \"for giving me life.\" Included in his anger are the other children they can't take care of. Capernaum (translated \"chaos\") is a stunning cinematic achievement that will make you forget the splash of Slumdog Millionaire, the grit of City of God, and the unbelievable nature of the law suit.Yet, given that his parents couldn't afford to register his birth and therefore denied him personhood in Lebanon, the suit doesn't seem so odd (\"I need proof that you're a human being,\" declaims an official to Zain). After they sell off his little sister, Sahar, to the grocer for whom Zain makes deliveries, Zain takes off on a picaresque journey that starts at an amusement park-figuratively appropriate.Like Slumdog, non-professional actors from the street in Capernaum lend the realism that De Sica practically patented in his iconic Italian neo-realism. Casting director Jennifer Haddad has done an enviable job drawing in children whose lives have reflected the ones they are playing, e.g., Zain has worked as a delivery boy since he was 10.After meeting Ethiopian immigrant Rahil (Yordanos Shiferaw), Zain takes care of her toddler Yonas (Boluwatife Treasure Bankole-a phenomenal one-year-old child actor) in a loving, protective, and resourceful way as the boy's troll Beirut to such a sweet intent it seems this could not be about a 12-year old child incarcerated for five years for stabbing an adult.Capernaum rightly won the Cannes Jury award and is nominated for a best foreign language Oscar. You will agree to that wisdom when you spend some time in director Nadine Labaki's unforgettable slice of mid-eastern life. Were it not for Netflix's Roma, Capernaum might win that category (Shoplifters, another example of \"poverty porn,\" also occupies that territory).Capernaum's overarching beauty is partly in the cinematography, which careens through the ghetto with such agility as to make the place familiar and charming in its chaos. Left by Yonas's mother, who is foolishly and miserably jailed before she can contact the boys, Zain tenderly takes care of the child, carrying him like a wounded brother in battle in the streets foraging for baby formula and looking for Rahil.Confronting his own mother in court, the handsome Zain has nothing but contempt for her as she sits there pregnant and oblivious to the pain she causes children she can't adequately raise. The suit becomes more a metaphor than a reality given its unlikely success.Throughout, Zain is resourceful and proud, giving back insults like a 30-year old. His acting and most others' are first-rate, astonishing because they are non-professionals. Working with gifted director Nadine Labaki for six months in Beirut shows the importance of location shooting and premier coaching.By the end, a sympathetic audience will forgive the formulaic coincidences and sweet resolutions because the bulk of the film is as real as the world of today's immigrants lining the Mexican border to the US.",

The camera explores a city most of us are thankful we do not have to deal with - and by forcing us to do exactly that: deal with it - if only cinematically, it opens us up to great sympathy and understanding of so many people living on the brink of total hopelessness. It must be something like the effect Rosellini's Italian neo-realism films had on European audiences after WW2, this feeling that we are seeing something filmed on the actual streets and in the actual homes of citizens under the great stress of living in a world of deprivation, where everything is broken, and deliverance is nowhere in sight. Much has been written about most of the cast being drawn from the city's streets, and if this is true of the young man who has the lead role of Zain, then we see here the debut of a naturally gifted actor who seems, as they say,\ndestined for stardom. The movie's overt plea for people not to have children until they can provide them with the simplest necessities is perhaps a controversial issue, but it's easy to see the logic behind it.\nThere are many indelible moments in this powerhouse of a movie, the most riveting sequence\nbeing the few days Zain spends taking care of a child who is barely 2 yrs. old and needs care much more than the 12 yr. old Zain himself does. How he can dredge up such compassion and care for the baby is a marvel to behold. The camera picks up his generous, selfless nature, reminding us it is his goodness that ends up carrying us to the end, where we finally see a long-awaited hopeful smile brighten his face.\nHunt this one down, search high and low, a stunning achievement in world cinema.",

            "content": "Greetings again from the darkness. Rare is the film that casts a kid in the lead role and then features him in most every scene ... often with only him and a toddler on screen. It's even rarer when that kid is a first time actor, and the film gets nominated for an Oscar (Best Foreign Language film). Each of these come to pass in the latest from writer-director Nadine Labaki (CARAMEL, 2007), with a script she co-wrote with four others: Jihad Hojelly, Michelle Keserwany, Georges Khabbaz, and Khaled Mouzanar (Ms. Labaki's husband, who also produced the film's music).The film opens in a courtroom setting which acts as a framing device for a story that is told mostly through flashbacks. Zain (Zain Al Rafeea) is asked by the judge why he is suing his parents. His answer: \"Because I was born.\" Zain is an undernourished 12 year old Lebanese slum-dweller who lives with his parents and an indeterminate number of brothers and sisters. Zain is particularly close to his 11 year old sister Sahar (Cedra Izzam), and the two work odd jobs on the streets to bring home money and food for the family. When Sahar comes of age, Zain knows this spells change, as their parents view her as little more than an asset that can be traded for chickens. When this happens, an angry Zain runs away from home.Zain's adventure takes him from the slums to shantytown, where a kind-hearted, poverty stricken single mom takes pity on him. Rahil (Yordanos Shiferaw) is an undocumented Ethiopian who works multiple jobs while hiding her toddler Yonas (so freaking adorable). In exchange for food and shelter, Zain agrees to babysit Yonas while Rahil works. The two young boys become like brothers, and when Rahil doesn't return home, Zain's street smarts kick in. He reverts to the lessons of his previous life and begins literally scrapping for scraps. His ingenuity is inspiring, as is his full-blown survival mode ... all while caring diligently for Yonas.In the courtroom, director Labaki appears as Zain's attorney, but it's the young actor who carries the weight of the film. He is truly remarkable to watch, whether he's interacting with other street hustlers, conversing with \"Cockroach Man\" on the bus, or in that final freeze-frame ending, Zain steals our heart. The film is not dissimilar to SHOPLIFTERS, the Japanese film also nominated for Best Foreign Language Oscar this year. The title means \"chaos\" and it begs the question, without paperwork, do we exist to society? Ms. Labaki manages to put a pretty face on a tragic environment, and offer up a rare matter-of-fact melodrama on the hardships for children in poverty.",

            "content": "Capharnaum - The MovieNadine Labaki always astonishes me with her work and this is actually my first time ever to write a review about a movie. But this... this is a masterpiece...Capharnaum managed to stir my emotions, it awakened my mind to things we see on a daily basis but decide to ignore. It was a big slap in the face, to be honest. As I watched, I hated myself for having food and shelter. I hated the fact that I paid 14.000 LBPs for my own pleasure and enjoyment to watch a movie. I hated the fact that I bought a $1 worth of pop corn for $7. Why do I get to enjoy a three-hour movie whilst others need that money for a three-day food supply? For those who still haven't seen it, it's a story of a supposedly 12-year old boy who gets sued for stabbing a \"son of a bitch\" (as the boy, Zain describes him). It depicts the life of a typical Lebanese poor family, only if the word poor was enough. It portrays how they eat, how they dress, how they talk and behave and what they do for a living. It was so REAL that I thought it was actual footage from Zain's life. The movie also displays the life of an Ethiopian woman who has no permit and who was knocked up by some guy and gave birth to a baby she can barely support. Oh, speaking of the Ethiopian woman; I was meaning to mention, as soon as the movie starts, we see Zain at court and then we also see the Ethiopian, Tegist with tears in her eyes while waiting for Internal Security to call out her name. At this point I'm really curious as of what this is going to be about and some guy behind me makes a \"funny\" joke about the scene saying \"oh, so the Ethiopian is the star of the movie?\"... I don't know why but I thought I'd mention that because it left me in shock... we'll get back to that later. Capharnaum addresses poverty, illiteracy, ignorance, cruelty, racism, unawareness and child abuse. On the other hand, it also addresses kindness, innocence, forgiveness and faith. It is just amazing how Zain worked so damn hard to support Tigest's baby all alone while his parents didn't have a care in the world for their own children. A 12-year old boy taking care of a baby was just so heartwarming and beautiful. \nZain's personality is amazingly complex and in him one can touch awareness and illiteracy at the same time. Innocence and violence. Politeness and insensitivity. Good and bad. Love and hate. \nHe had a vision, he had a message. \nHis message was bigger than governments and countries. It was bigger than you and me. It was a message that we decide to laugh about instead of help spread. The message is simplified in one word: AWARENESS.About the guy I mentioned earlier, lets hope he has learned something from the movie...Lets make this movie our prayer before going to bed every night... Then, we could try and change the world to the better.Nadine Labaki keeps on dazzling us with her great work... I can't wait for the next one. We, as Lebanese, are so proud of you. And the whole world should be. Much love.",

            "content": "Taking as its subject the horrific plight of guttersnipe children in the slums of Beirut, Capharna\u00fcm is the kind of film of which a superficial reading might suggest miserablism at best, and \"poverty porn\" at worst. Comparisons to film such as Slumdog Millionaire (2008), Trash (2014), and The Florida Project (2017) are probably inevitable, albeit not very informative if one wishes to parse the film. Instead, it's much more useful to view Capharna\u00fcm in the tradition of classic Italian neorealist pictures such as Ossessione (1943), Roma citt\u00e0 aperta (1945), and Ladri di biciclette (1948), albeit far more pessimistic than any of them.The third film from Lebanese writer/actress/director Nadine Labaki, Capharna\u00fcm is written by Labaki, Michelle Keserwany, and Labaki's regular writing partner Jihad Hojeily (Labaki's husband Georges Khabbaz and the film's producer and composer, Khaled Mouzanar are both credited with \"screenplay collaboration\"). Presenting a milieu in which people are utterly discardable, the film depicts children who are literally bought and sold for a few chickens; 11-year-old girls who are married off so their family can afford the rent; babies who are fed on ice cubes covered in sugar; refugees who roam the streets; mental illness which goes untreated; and people without a Lebanese identity card who don't officially exist. The film works because it never feels like it's exploiting, patronising, or trivialising the poverty and misfortune it depicts, never attempting to manipulate the audience into feeling a preconceived emotion. On the contrary, it's matter-of-fact, and notable for just how unsentimental it is. However, it's also deeply humanist, with genuine compassion in its DNA and a quiet rage at its core, born partly from an inherent sense of authenticity; shot in the style of cin\u00e9ma v\u00e9rit\u00e9, it uses non-professional actors whose lives are not dissimilar from the characters they play. There are some problems, of course - the framing device of a trial is poorly conceived and distracts from the superior filmmaking surrounding it, the ending is disappointingly didactic, and the litany of hardships endured by the main character does get a little over-the-top. However, this is undeniably impressive filmmaking, as harrowing and angry, as it is solicitous and respectful.The film tells the story of Zain El Hajj (Zain Al Rafeea), a young boy from the slums of Beirut serving a five-year prison sentence for, as he puts it, \"stabbing a son-of-a-bi-ch.\" Neither he nor his parents, mother Souad (Kawsar Al Haddad) and father Selim (Fadi Yousef), know Zain's exact age, as he was never officially registered, and therefore has no birth cert. As the film begins, Zain is brought before a judge, as he has decided to sue his parents for bringing him into the world despite not being able to care for their already numerous children. The film then flashes back several months, showing Zain running away from home after failing to prevent his parents selling his beloved 11-year-old sister Sahar (Cedra Izzam) to the landlord Assad (Nour El Husseini). Seeking refuge in a rundown amusement park, he meets Rahil (Yordanos Shiferaw), an Ethiopian refugee working as a cleaner. Taking pity on him, she agrees to let him stay with her in exchange for him looking after her one-year-old son Yonas (an absolutely astounding performance by Boluwatife Treasure Bankole) when she's at work, and the trio quickly form a close bond, until one day, Rahil doesn't return home.Thoroughly uplifting stuff, am I right? The title of the film is a French word (alternatively spelt Capernaum). The term was originally the name of a Biblical fishing village on the northern shore of the Sea of Galilee, which is mentioned multiple times across all four gospels, as a place where Jesus performed several miracles. However, it's best known from Matthew 11:23, when Jesus curses the village for its lack of faith in him. Later on, however, the word came to be used in French literature to signify a state of chaos and disorder. The current dictionary definition is, \"a confused jumble; a place marked by a disorderly accumulation of objects\".From an aesthetic perspective, Labaki wisely keeps things simple and functional, eschewing any directorial gymnastics, with the aesthetic design perfectly chosen to convey the story she wishes to tell. Adopting a documentarian style, cinematographer Christopher Aoun sticks to handheld cameras and, for the most part, natural lighting. The scenes on the streets of Beirut are especially impressive, with Labaki shooting most of the material from roughly Zain's height, or slightly lower. This allows the scenes to adopt a heavily focalised and subjective view of the world, without having to resort to less elegant POV shots. Chadi Roukoz's sound design is also superb in these exterior scenes, with the soundtrack crammed with car horns, shouting, crying, laughter, dogs barking, airplanes flying overhead, traffic on the streets. It's an aural overload, conveying how the massive city is overwhelming Zain, and again, tying us to his subjectivity. Placing us not just in Zain's world, but, crucially, in his subjective interpretation of that world, Labaki draws us to him, allowing us to view the world partly as outraged adults, but also as sharers in his experiences.Zain is no saint; he's a rough, foul-mouthed thief, but he's also the most inherently honourable character in the film. Labaki could easily have used Zain to attempt to elicit unearned pity, but instead, she is far more interested in examining the day-to-day survival of children like him. One of his most salient characterises is his practical-minded solutions to the challenges he faces, and in this, we're encouraged to respect how he responds to his situation rather than pity him for being in such a situation in the first place. The film adopts something of the same manner; much like Zain, it's tough-minded and practical, and just as his hardened exterior is completely authentic, so too is the film's quiet anger.Labaki sets the tone for the film to come in the very first shot, as we see Zain, filthy dirty, in only his vest and underwear. It is subsequently driven home multiple times that life is almost worthless in this place - Sahar is sold for some chickens, Rahil is encouraged to sell Yonas in return for forged migrant documents, one man brags, \"I can buy a human for 500\". This is a world in which people think of children in the same way as they think of commodities, with the notion of adults protecting children subservient to that of adults looking at children in a cold transactional manner. In such a place, Zain somehow manages to retain his sense of empathy, although he too is infected with the concept that everything is transactional, as his pragmatism illustrates to him that materialism is the order of the day. However, although he suppresses his sense of compassion, he does not completely extinguish it, nor would he want to. In a world where adults are reprehensible, and children their innocent victims, Zain is the story's moral compass, exhibiting a humanity far in excess of any kindness than has ever been shown to him.In terms of problems, there are a few. The framing device of the trial, for example, is awkwardly realised, and for the most part, serves only to interrupt the far more compelling story of Zain, Rahil, and Yonas. Additionally, not only do the scenes in court come across as more heavily scripted than everything else, but they also depict something that couldn't happen (as Labaki herself has acknowledged, children can't sue their parents for giving birth to them). Obviously intended as a means to dramatize how Zain wants a voice, it is nonetheless a narrative contrivance that gets in the way of the far more accomplished filmmaking seen elsewhere. Surrounded by the more naturalistic realism of the rest of the film, the court scenes stand out because they feel like a plot machination. The third act in particular, which focuses primarily on the trial, strays into something Labaki has deftly avoid everywhere else; didacticism. Elsewhere, there is something of a sense that Labaki overloads the story, pushing just one too many hardships on Zain, as she attempts to cover a plethora of topics (including, but not limited to domestic violence, the migrant crisis, human trafficking, paedophilia, child labour, education, the justice system), and on occasion, the film feels like it's going to collapse under the weight of human suffering and thematic nihilism. This is a shame because some of the best scenes are those involving Zain and Yonas just going about their day, and if Labaki had had the confidence in these quieter moments, she might have scaled back on the socio-political content.Never feeling exploitative, nor glorifying the poverty at its centre, the film isn't even especially sentimental, depicting scenes with a raw matter-of-factness, that were they featured in a Hollywood movie would be in slow-motion, with string music telling us to \"Cry now\". The conclusion is disappointingly didactic, and the journey there harrowing and exhausting. However, in the last shot, Labaki dares to offer a very cautious bit of optimism, and ultimately, the takeaway is not despair, but compassion. Just as Zain finds a humanity within himself that should be long dead, the film finds a moment of optimism amidst the chaos, and encourages the audience to cling to it.",

            "content": "I first heard about this Lebanese film when film critic Mark Kermode gave his review for it on BBC News The Film Review, and then I found it listed in the book 1001 Movies You Must See Before You Die, so I was most interested in it. Basically, twelve-year-old Zain El Hajj (Zain Al Rafeea) is serving a five-year sentence in Roumieh Prison for murder, after stabbing someone and showing no remorse. Neither Zain nor his parents know his exact date of birth as they never received an official birth certificate. In court, Zain declares he wants to sue his mother Souad (Kawsar Al Haddad) and his father Selim (Fadi Kamel Yousef). When asked by the judge why he wants to sue his parents, Zain answers \"Because I was born\". Meanwhile, Lebanese authorities process a group of migrant workers, including a young Ethiopian woman named Rahil (Yordanos Shiferaw). The story then flashes back several months to before Zain was arrested. He is a gutsy, streetwise child living with his parents and at least seven other siblings who make money in various schemes instead of going to school. Zain forges prescription drugs for his mother to sell drug-soaked clothing to drug addicts. Zain also works as a delivery boy for Assad (Nour El Husseini), the family's landlord, and the owner of a local market stall. One morning, Zain helps his eleven-year-old sister Sahar (Cedra Izzam) to hide the evidence of her first period, fearing she will be married if her parents discover that she can now become pregnant. Zain makes plans to escape with Sahar and begin a new life. He finally runs away, angered when his parents do indeed marry off Sahar to Assad, and catches a bus with an elderly man dressed in a knock-off superhero costumes, he calls him Cockroachman (Joseph Jimbazian). At the Luna Park in Ras Beirut, Zain meets Rahil, an Ethiopian migrant worker who is working as a cleaner at a theme park. She takes pity on Zain and agrees to let him live with her in exchange for Zain babysitting her undocumented infant son Yonas (Boluwatife Treasure Bankole) when she is at work. Rahil's forged migrant documents are due to expire, and she doesn't have enough money to pay her forger Aspro (Alaa Chouchnieh) for new documents. Rahil refuses Aspro's offer to adopt Yonas to him in exchange for the documents to be forged for free. Rahil's documents expire and she is arrested by Lebanese authorities. Zain panics when she does not return, and after several days he begins looking after Yonas, claiming he is his brother, and sells drugs again to make money. One day, while at Souk Al Ahad, Zain meets young girl Syrian refugee Maysoun (Farah Hasno) and claims that Aspro has agreed to send her to Sweden. Zain demands that Aspro send him to Sweden as well, Aspro agrees to do so if Zain gives him Yonas. Zain reluctantly agrees, and Aspro tells him that he will need some form of identification. Zain returns to his parents and demands they give him his identification, but they tell him he doesn't have any. Having disowned him for leaving, they kick him out of their house. Before leaving his parents reveal to him that Sahar died due to pregnancy complications. Zain is furious, steals a knife and stabs Assad. He is arrested and sentenced to five years in prison. While in prison, Zain learns that his mother is pregnant and plans to name the child Sahar. Disgusted by his mother's lack of remorse for her daughter's death, he contacts the media and says that he is tired of parents neglecting their children and plans to sue his parents for having children when they cannot care for them. Zain also claims that Aspro is adopting children illegally and mistreating them. Aspro's house is raided and the children and parents are reunited, including Yonas and Rahil. Zain's photo is taken for his ID card. Also starring Elias Khoury as The Judge. Rafeea gives a compelling performance as the pre-adolescent boy living in poverty doing whatever it takes to solve his money problems, the court case is not something you can seriously, but the leading actor, authentic locations, hand-held cinematography and apparently improvised material make it all worthwhile, an interesting drama. It was nominated the Oscar for Best Foreign Language Film of the Year, it was nominated the BAFTA for Best Film Not in the English Language, and it was nominated the Golden Globe for Best Motion Picture - Foreign Language.

            "content": "Nadine Labaki's CAPERNAUM practically dares one to say anything bad about it. After all, who could be 'against' a movie that exposes child abuse, the Syrian refugee crisis and human trafficking? Good intentions however, shouldn't be a barrier against critical thinking.\nFirst the positive. Labaki tale about a 12 year old Lebanese runaway Zain (Zain Al Rafeea) plunges us into the crowded streets. Zain's journey takes us from his dysfunctional family into the world of refugees, with abject poverty all around him. The camera-work is particularly adept. He meets up with an 'illegal' Ethiopian woman Rahil (Yordanos Shiferaw) and her baby and they form their own kind of outlaw family. There is no question of the poignancy and power of some of his encounters. (there's even a bit of humor, including an encounter with an elderly Spiderman impersonator who calls himself 'Cockroach Man'). Young Zain is a screen natural. He commands the screen (and is in every significant scene).\nThe movie's set-up revolves around court appearances for Zain. It's not an unworthy idea, but, in practice, it undercuts the flow of the events - and Zain's character. Cutting back and forth in time and continuity is too 'cinematic' for such a naturalistic movie. More critically, Labaki (who is also a co-writer) has Zain spout dialogue that isn't fully credible for an uneducated street urchin. And, then there's Khaled Mouzanar's score which telegraphs every single emotion the viewer is supposed to feel at every moment. If ever there were a movie which demanded a lighter (or even unscored) approach it's this one.\nCAPERNAUM has its heart in the correct place, but, Labaki's treatment of it, fits its translated title all to well - Chaos.",

The plot alone provides a totally gripping tension throughout, however that is rather masterfully intensified by the standout-jaw dropping-magnificent performance from the protagonist, played by Zain Al Rafeea. Zain plays a 12-year-old boy by the same first name and it is undoubtedly one of the best, if not the best performance I have ever witnessed from a child actor.The premise of the film surrounds Zain and the extreme hardships he must go through at the hands of his family, but more specifically the world he was born into. Despite many believed connotations of this film being around refugees, it's more a picture of human survival, extreme misfortune in life and profound stoicism. After watching this film, I find it hard to believe that anybody wouldn't take their life for granted.Nadine Labaki does a superb job of keeping this film as raw as it should be, and although on face value the film is about the horrific destitution which the protagonist has to go through, it is more a symbol of the horrors which go on in poverty stricken counties in the Middle East; horrors which to the West would seem otherworldly.This film evoked more emotion than any film has in a very long time, the shedding of tears should be prepared for prior to watching it. One of my favourite quotes of the whole film brings more painfully grievous connotations to an often informal phase... \"Life is a bitch\" - Zain.",

The film was co-written and directed by Nadine Labaki.Zain Al Rafeea portrays Zain, a 12-year-old boy who is intelligent, resourceful, and caring. Sadly, he comes from a background of extreme poverty, where his parents must use of of their resources just to keep the children alive. (Except for one of Zain's sisters, we never get a sense of how many children there are. They sleep curled up together like puppies.)For tragic reasons, Zain leaves home and tries to survive on the streets. He meets a Somali woman named Rahil, played by Yordanos Shiferaw. Zain, Rahil, and Rahil's son form a family of sorts. However, they too are entrapped by poverty and abuse.This movie is so powerful that it's hard to watch. It gives us a true glimpse into what life is like when you are poor and powerless. The reason it's a great film is not because it makes you feel good, but because it helps you to understand how bad life can be for others.Note that Capernaum has an IMDb rating of 8.4! I can't remember any recent film carrying a rating that high. The high rating is well deserved.We saw this film on the large screen at Tucson's wonderful Loft Cinema.

Well, whilst there were some (much needed) light comedic moments, this film was about as grim as they come. Does not make you feel good about the world and what human beings can do to fellow human beings. Whilst set in Lebanon, this film could've taken place almost anywhere, such is the human desire to exploit for personal gain.Zain is resourceful and wise beyond his years. He selflessly looks after a baby, whose mother goes missing. And this part of the film is probably the most astonishing. The baby acting was incredible! How did they do it? And the fact that the young Lebanese boy who played Zain, was also called Zain (Al Rafeea) was telling. I understand that the brilliant writer/director Nadine Labaki encouraged the cast to ad lib, and Zain (and the baby) did so to wonderful effect, drawing on his real life experiences. Labaki then rewrote the script based on new plot developments instigated by the cast. Astonishing.As a piece of filmmaking, you don't get much better than this. You may not find the film 'entertaining' but my word you would have to have a heart of stone not to be emotionally affected by the plight of Zain and his performance. A wonderful 8.5 out of ten.",

And is remarkable for the performances captured of its many unprofessional child and adult actors.The film's hero is an small child named Zain, who is the eldest child of an already large family struggling daily to have the most basic needs met. Part of the struggle the family faces is that although they are Lebanese, they are undocumented. This prevents them from accessing many services and proper work and leaves the parents with few prospects. Zain must help support his family through a number of street businesses and has never been free to attend school. These hardships have already formed Zain into a resourceful, street wise kid who is very protective of his younger siblings.\nWhen Zain can't prevent his younger sister Sahar from being wed-off to a neighbourhood shop owner he runs away from his verbally abusive parents. Zain lands on his feet when he finds shelter helping care for the toddler of an Ethiopian housekeeper who is now working using false papers. When Rahil is arrested for being in the county illegally Zain is left for many days to care for Yonas with no idea why the mother is not returning.\nAs this part of the story unfolds Zain, against all odds, is able to care for his new brother all while pulling him around the city in a cooking pot on a skateboard. But their luck runs out when they are locked out of their small shanty by an unknown landlord. When Zain is unable to get help retrieving his small stash of savings he turns to a forger who Rahil had been using to get fake documents. But this man is also a child smuggler and convinces Zain that Yonas would be better off with a new family and that he can help Zain migrate to Europe. Zain returns to his parents to find any personal documents they might have for him. A serious argument occurs when it is revealed that Sahar has died form medical complications relating to her young age of being a bride. Zain rushes off with a knife to confront the shopkeeper husband.\nThroughout the film we have been seeing short flash forwards of Zain being in a Juvenile Court room. And it is at this point that we see why it has in fact been two separate trials. One for Zain's attack on the shopkeeper and one that Zain brings against his parents from jail.\nThe second trial, originally an attack on Zair's parents' parenting choices, turns into enditment of the treatment of undocumented people in Lebanon. Zair's time in prison also serves as a foil for him to re-encounter Rahil.\nThe film ends with a triumphant rescuing of Yonas from the child smugglers and a hinting that Zain's parents, although very flawed, are in fact struggling with love for the betterment of their children over their own dreams.",

How can I possibly describe this feeling in one word? After the movie, I sat down speechlessly, being uncomfortable and being overwhelmed by guilt. 'Capernaum' pushes me to feel another level of emotion because it rather feels like a documentary than a fiction. The realism of this movie brings attention to the reality. I feel as if while I watch the movie, one kid in Lebanon is actually suffering from poverty, abuse, and inner turmoil a child should never experience. The most daunting fact is movie is not an exaggeration.A child losing childhood, life being so hard on him, and repeating after his abusive parents even though viewers know that he has a tender heart because that is all he has seen in the world. I am relieved that it ends with hopeful insinuation; if not, I would be totally depressed of devastation and helplessness.The movie achieves realism to the level of the documentary film. Camera movement mostly follow Zain's point of view, and it moves when Zain moves and runs when he runs. When he runs to hurt Assad, the camera does not focus on one point, changing the direction many times in short period of time, representing his mindset, being empty. AND a child actor Zain Al Rafeea is an inexperienced actor who went through similar life as Zain, and choosing him for the main character is director's best choice. Because of him, it all looks, no reflects what's happening on the other side of the world so well. The movie's genuineness really depended on him, and he manages to pull it off successfully.",

And excellent job from Khaled the composer for the wonderful music thoughout the movie.

Living in a place like Lebanon is one of them.It is a heart-breaking movie and even if it is fiction I have no doubt that most of what is shown in the movie is a reflection of current living condiitons in Lebanon for a lot of people.The plot is about a boy that sues his parents, but that is the framework to show how some people live in the country.The actor portraying the boy is excellent and so his parents. One can also see the struggle of an paperless Ethiopian refugee struggling to survive with a boy baby son. I wonder how bad it can be in Ethiopy for a women risking jail in Lebanon to have escaped from Ethiopy.Despite all the bitterness the film also shows the empathy and solidarity between the boy and the Ethipian women.",

The framing story of this movie is a court trial in which a 12 year old boy named Zain (Zain el Rafeea, actually a Syrian refugee) sues his parents (Kawthar al Haddad and Fadi Kamel Youssef) for giving birth to him. It is set and was actually filmed in contemporary Beirut, which is crowded, dirty, and full of slums. Zain is never seen going to school and is small for his age because of poor nutrition, but he is very \"street smart\". Some critics have compared him to Huckleberry Finn. He spends his time hustling on the streets to help support his family, which includes several siblings, and their activities include drug smuggling. After his parents sell his pretty 11 year old sister Sahar (Cedra Izam) as a bride for a few chickens to a local grocer (Nour el Husseini), Zain runs away from home. He moves in with an Ethiopian refugee mother Rahil (Yordanos Shiferaw) and her infant daughter Yonas (Boluwatife Treasure Bankole), where he babysits the girl while the mother is working. The mother is an undocumented immigrant, so when she is arrested by the authorities, Zain is stuck providing for her daughter. While their lives are brutal, there is just enough humor in the film to make it watchable. The child actors, all non-professionals, are excellent, and the film was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film.",

The photography plays very well with the environment and light, it helps to position the viewer in a chaotic and suffocating scenario.

There are areas in Beiruts were the roads are too tight for SUVs to come with their equipment. In addition, these roads aren't paved.So I understand that the crew needed a portable setup. Drones and DSLRsSome people are saying that these were done just to get the hype for the film but in my opinion there is an economical reason for the style the movie was done in.The crew was also working with inexperienced actors so a lot of them would uncomfortable with talking with the camera head on. That would be a reason why for most of the scenes the camera seems hidden and in strange angles.There seems to be consistent argument that the Director picked the pretty faced boy to compile the story more to the foreign audience. To be honest, the movie industry has been shameless about this from a . I would agree that the main character was played by some one who wasn't as pretty. The story would't have been as significant to me.I would also like to emphasize that the main character and his family are meant to be Lebanese not Syrian or Palestinian in the film. There has been a repeated concern that the movie depicts Syrian refugees in a very poor manner. The movie does the opposite. It depicts Syrian Refugees in a better situation than the local poorer community.Now as much as I like the film, the movie did have its flaws which were pointed out by the low rating reviews. I was going to give a 10 but after reading the reviews. I had to drop it to a 9.*********************Spoilers*********************\nThe second character you see in the film is the director herself. She plays as the child's lawyer and is somewhat playing the kid's savior in a way. It annoys me because it depicts the image that only the director herself can solve the situation. She is also putting herself on a self proclaimed pedestal. It also states that she sides with Zain's solution that these people shouldn't have children. I understand that Zain is 12 years old and is quite short tempered but his lawyer should be educated and a bit more reasonable. Again, if the lawyer wasn't played by the director I would be more forgiving.In addition, throughout the film Zain does not beg for money. He always buys what he can and tries to find work. This made me like the character more. The fact that he thought himself as a capable individual who didn't want anything handed to him.\n*********************Spoilers*********************If you are lebanese, I highly recommend to watch this. It's rarely we have movies that depict these kind of situations in the country. They are always shunned to side from the public eye but they need to be brought forward and discussed.A Movie that is current to the times.

It is a struggle, It is so painful, It is so hurtful to see children do this.

            "content": "\"Capharna\u00fcm\" (not the easiest title to get right) or \"Capernaum\" or \"Chaos\" is a Lebanese and American co-production that is mostly in the Lebanese language and this is not the first film, but the big breakthrough film for female filmmaker Nadine Labaki. Her work here runs for pretty much exactly 2 hours and we get to witness the struggles of a young boy in particular with his family, but also with strangers and the impact they have on his life. Really baity material and yep I am not surprised this film already garnered some major awards attention, most of all at the Cannes Film Festival, but also got in at the Golden Globes for example and seems very likely to make it into the last 5 Foreign Language Films from the extended list of 9 at this point. We will see. I think it is a decent film overall. And even if I don't think it is that great or best-of-the-year material, it would not be an undeserving Oscar nominee (if we forget for once the Italian entry got critically snubbed, that one would have been a great winner). Also thumbs-up for the child actor here, who is in virtually every scene from start to finish and does a really good job for his age. This film was also so well-received for the image of society it gives us, regardless if it is about parents sending their 11-year-old daughters into wedlock, salesmen trading very small children, innocent people being imprisoned or a lot more gruesome acts you get to hear about during these 120 minutes. So it is a pretty touching film. I also think the ending definitely makes it memorable. On the downside, it also lets audiences forget about some mediocrities during the previous 2 hours because it is that good. It is somewhat happy, but not entirely, but yeah finding the Black boy again is a bit of an emotional highlight fur sure, even if before that I was not too fond of the really really long story involving him and his mother. I thought the film had better flow before and after that when it is about the boy's relationship with his own parents and siblings. There is of course the heartbreaking story about his sister and there's no way that one won't touch you. How close he gets to taking the bus and gets away with her before his parents prevail. He even proves a worthy opponent (if you want to call him that) to his mother and that way he could have saved the girl's life. Or of course the really devastating comment from his mother about her new pregnancy and how she thinks this one could reduce the protagonist's pain. There is some real absurdity when she even says she will name the girl the same like her deceased daughter, which somehow shows that she is completely replacable and that the woman is probably not really capable of true motherly love, even if on one occasion she minimally protects the boy when the father has another violent outburst.What else? Oh yeah, the courtroom/trial scenes. Well, these did not do too much for me to be honest. I could have done without them entirely and to me it felt a bit like a weak Slumdog Millionaire parody. The more I think of it, the more these two films resemble one another. Oh yeah, we get to see the Black boy's mother in the witness stand and her words make it seem for a moment as if the central character could have killed or lets say stabbed her son, but this was certainly intended, even if the longer the film went, the more it became clear that the boy had a real connection with this very young child and would never do such a thing. The scene when he prefers to leave him behind like a dog and how he suffers from that before giving the boy to the suspicious guy shows that really he only wants the best for his new friend. And that the target must be somebody else. My money was initially on the guy who bought the boy, but wrong again. I won't tell you the actual \"victim\", but yeah it is somewhat obvious and perhaps the right person who gets it if you can call such an act of violence even right from any perspective. That fella is certainly also only a victim of his culture. Eventually I also really want to emphasize the film's very last shot that is somewhat evidence of how sad a movie this is. We need to wait all this time to see the boy finally smile and even there it is just a fake smile, even if a really contagious one. This shot makes the desparation of it all very easy to understand.Anyway, completely away from the story, this film is a success as well, some really nice camera work in here on many occasions, mouthwatering stuff indeed, and the music is also pretty fitting on each and every occasion. Or the lack thereof. This was an enjoyable film that sadly once again does not get the attention here in Germany that it should have. In my viewing, there was only one other audience member. Sad to see, but well, maybe the number will increase during the weekend. In any case, I am curious how this film will fare at the Oscars, even if there is most likely no way it will prevail over dominant awards season powerhorse Roma by Alfonso Cuar\u00f3n. But that doesn't mean you should not watch Capharna\u00fcm (the \u00fc still baffles me). No hesitation for me in giving this film a thumbs-up. Go check it out. I have seen other reviewers call this very close to a documentary and I agree with them. It does feel that realistic and authentic and that sure speaks for the quality of everybody involved with this project, most of all lead actor Al Rafeea and filmmaker Labaki.",

            "content": "An old and famous carnival called Jo\u00e3osinho Trinta said that \"the people like luxury, those who like misery are intellectual.\" It was one of his most remarkable sentences. It is very easy to sit in the privileged chair of an air-conditioned cinema and all the facilities that a privileged life can give and \"admire\" with the sociologist's air the misery exposed by the Lebanese director Nadine Labaki, and speak with wonders about \"Capharna\u00fcm\". It is extremely easy to contemplate the long-suffering Zain saga (Zain Al Rafeea), pose as a bar-table left intellectual, and lecture on social injustices and the need to seek a more egalitarian and less cruel society.These are legitimate interpretations, but I'm going to try to run away from them for the sake of appearing as insensitive and distant as the image of Zain's lawyer in the plot, lived by the director herself, who has no reaction to the speech of the boy's mother in court saying that she would never know what it is to have her life. And she could never bear what she endured. This is one of the many very strong scenes in this movie. In fact, as the lawyer, as much as I could sensitize myself with all the drama, as much as I could empathize, I would never know what it is to live and how to describe what it is to be so on the fringes of a society like Zain and your family.\"Capharna\u00fcm\" is a masterpiece with which we rarely see. It is also a film about how we fail as human beings in the most varied aspects. The exploitation of misery, slave labor, violation of the most basic rights, families devastated by poverty and lack of perspective of a better situation, the illegality of immigrant life, arranged marriages in exchange for money, negligent parents with their children. \"Capharna\u00fcm\" is a rosary of personal tragedies exhibited in 125 minutes of film.It is almost as if the region remained to this day suffering from the denial of Christ. The name of the film refers to the biblical city that was on the north shore of the Sea of Galilee. Nearby was the important Via Maris (road to the sea), which linked Egypt, Syria and Lebanon. In the Bible, Capernaum is one of the places where Jesus performed a series of miracles, such as two exorcisms, the healing of Peter's mother-in-law from a disease, and the healing of a paralytic in the well-known passage of the Bible where Jesus said to the man: \"Get up and walk.\" But, according to history, the people of the city also ended up not repenting of their sins and turned away from Jesus, who had foreseen the destruction of the city. From there, Capernaum, which was a center for tax collection and where there was also a Roman military post declined, becoming uninhabited in the fifth century after Christ.If it is possible to draw a parallel between the Biblical Capernaum and Lebanon drawn by Nadine, it is precisely in the moral misery of the human being who exploits one another, even in the lower strata. The human being who does not repent of his sins and continues reproducing the exploratory and vicious behaviors at every moment.At the center of the film is the story of the young Zain (lived monstrously by the boy Zain Al Rafeea). The 12-year-old forced to adulthood because of his parents' negligence, was arrested and sentenced to five years in prison for stabbing a man who had married his sister, Sahani. The reason for the crime was the death of the 11-year-old girl shortly after her pregnancy.Older of his many brothers, Zain had been forced to mature strength to help support the family. And it is because he already has an almost adult awareness in the body of a child that the youngster decides to sue his parents for the crime of having given them life. Zain considers that his parents were criminally negligent with the whole family and can no longer have children. The evidence was in his dead sister and himself, a teenager arrested and not even formally registered.The film alternates scenes of the trial with Zain's journey in the streets of Lebanon. Difficult life, difficulties to eat, lack of hope after losing the sister who had menstruated for the first time recently to a man who just wanted to abuse her...Until the escape comes and Zain comes across the Ethiopian immigrant Rahil (Yordanos Shiferaw), who welcomes him. Zain then takes care of his son, Yonas (Boluwatife Treasure Bankole), until the day she just does not come back. Illegal, Rahil is caught by the police, leaving Zain alone taking care of Yonas.It is one of the most dramatic moments of the film the period in which Zain sees himself as a father. It's heart-breaking to see him try and try to do the right thing and turn around like giving to feed the child and take care of it. Everything until the moment when it does not have more forces because the life between those who are at the margin simply can not advance.We see all this through Zain's eyes. A boy who does not find Hollywood heroes to help him. The closest to it is the old \"Cockroach-Man\", the \"cousin of Spider-Man\", which crosses his path. Zain needs to be the hero himself. So young, the boy feels himself carrying a huge burden of existence when all he wanted was to be a good man. And his speech at the end of the film is absolutely touching at the same time that it is very hard.\"Capharna\u00fcm\" deserved more than a mere Oscar nomination for foreign film. Maybe it's the best of all those who run for the Oscars. At least Cannes recognized its value by giving it three awards last year. Nadine Labaki has made a hard and brilliant film that deserves to be seen by all.",

A film that sends the same messages about parenting, kids and poverty on a more subtle, believable way. Unfortunately, now we can only witness this long set of scenes that have the occasional sparkle (especially in the second part) but feel utterly disconnected. So at the end it leaves us unimpressed or not really interested in the outcome for this boy, court hearing or anything else that is of great matter to the authors of this film.

However, for the next 60 minutes or so - half the movie - the film just drifts when it should be filling in the blanks. Yes, it shows the abject poverty that the main characters live in but it goes nowhere to providing a background to the main story. It is really only interesting if you never knew such poverty exists and/or never watched a movie that depicts such conditions (and scores of such movies exist).Worst of all, while the movie goes nowhere, it goes there incredibly slowly. Scores of scenes and detours that are unnecessary. However, there are some good, emotional moments amongst the tedium and this keeps you hoping that the movie is about to shift up a gear or two.Things do start to find some degree of focus in the third quarter but even then it's a bit of a false dawn. You're still in the dark as to what happened, and why, and what the point of all this is.I was starting to think the main plot was just a ruse to suck viewers in and that it was never going to be resolved when things are explained and the plot suddenly becomes tighter and more meaningful. The movie then hurtles to a conclusion.So, essentially you have 100 or so minutes of drifting, largely aimless plot development followed by everything being sown up in about 20 minutes. Ridiculously bad pacing that makes you realise that the movie really should have been about 40-60 minutes long!The ending is worth the slog, however, as it is quite powerful and profound.One also can't fault the performances. Zain Al Rafeea is excellent as the boy.",

He joins another family which includes Rahil (Yordanos Shiferaw), an illegal Ethiopian refugee, and her one-year-old son Yonas (Boluwatife Treasure Bankole).The film's title literally means 'chaos' in Arabic and it fits the film and its characters perfectly. Whether it be child brides, human trafficking, extreme poverty, refugees entering Lebanon, undocumented Lebanese wanting to leave Lebanon as refugees, and all of the usual other crimes that make great drama, \"Capernaum\" is chaos galore.At two hours, it feels rather long at times especially as it exposes so much despair with emotional distance. While most characters are well developed, those of Zain's parents are not. His mother Souad (Kawthar Al Haddad) is a monster throughout most of the film, then suddenly seems human in the later scenes. This extreme change might have been more believable if the film included a revelation scene which it did not.But the main characters carry the film all the way. Young Al Rafeea is the perfect anchor as someone who is wise beyond his years out of unfortunate necessity. He has an instinctual desire to protect his siblings whether it be his biological sister or his adoptive brother (Bankole has to be one of the most adorable youngsters to ever bless the silver screen). And Shiferaw more than holds her own as well.Yes, \"Capernaum\" is distressing and heartbreaking at times but it is worth watching especially in some key scenes at the end one of which includes a final still shot that can melt the coldest of hearts. - dbamateurcritic",

This movie deserves an Oscar for sure and the world should feel how these kids are selling themselves and lives just to survive.\"in Sweden kids die by the order of God only\"this phrase killed me cause I know kids in my country do not face the same fate.",

The kid who played Zain, did such an amazing job that I felt everything that he felt. It made me think that a person is defined by how they spend their childhood, and how they are treated is what makes them when they are adult and still we judge people so easily that we forget the hardships or struggles that person may have gone through. Despite of all the struggles that Zain went through he still loved his sister and the baby to which he wasn't connected in any way except humanity, It was difficult for him to part ways from his sister as well as that baby and the crime that he committed was also out of love for his sister. I don't know what to say anymore but I think this is one of the best movies ever made. The movie is made so real that while writing this review I feel like Zain is out there, as if this movie was just a part of his real life.\nThis movie will stay with me forever.",

            "content": "As someone who knows quite little about Lebanon and doesn't naturally seek out emotional character journeys, Capernaum really impressed and struck me. The movie shows scenes from a courtroom early on, where we learn Zain stabbed someone and is suing his parents for neglect. Then we go back through his life to understand what happened. I found it a very effective choice to show the outcome early, as it imposes an air of inevitability and futility that seeps into even the hopeful moments of Zain's narrative, which I think deepens the empathy we feel for his situation. The second act is pretty slow, watching Zain's day-to-day life caring for Yonas, but it is important in Zain's struggle, and the first and third acts make up for it in intensity. The family dynamic and relationship between Sahar and Zain was beautiful early on, and seeing how events came together to make him lash out first at Assaad physically and then at his parents legally was a powerful payoff. Labaki is telling Zain's story here and doesn't provide much insight into why the parents make the choices they do, but she is still successful in making us think about the overt moral questions she asks: was it immoral for the parents to have a bunch of kids without really being able to support them? What are the expectations of parents and families, and what systems should be in place if they fail? How does one break out of this cycle of abuse and poverty? I empathized deeply with Zain in this film, as any audience would. Capernaum is extremely effective as a slice of life character movie and in showing culture and life in Lebanon, and Zain's story and beliefs will stay with me.",

It is very well directed and, as many have said before, the kid in this movie is just amazing. But, having said all that, I found the movie to lack a bit of focus, especially in the first half, having too much to say without the time to do it. I think it needed to decide if it wanted to tell the tale of a boy and his very poor family or how a runaway kid can survive in a very rough environment or how can an illegal immigrant get through life in Lebanon or the proceedings of a courtroom drama about an existential issue. Having so much ground to cover it takes a while to get to, what is for me the most interesting and memorable part of this tale, when the kid has to survive on his own. That segment of the movie is absolutely flawless, and I dare anyone to be left cold watching it. Another thing I didn't love was the way the movie tied everything neatly in the end, that too felt a bit fabricated to fit the movie.

            "content": "This my be the best political film I've ever seen. It's Bunuel's classic Los Olvidados (1950) on steroids. Of course, it's not about politics. But its every fiber arouses fury at the political systems that enable such hell on earth.\nIn Lebanon a 12-year-old Syrian refugee boy Zain is serving a five-year jail sentence for stabbing the adult man who married and fatally impregnated the boy's 11-year-old sister. Their parents forced her into marriage.\nNow Zain is suing his parents for bringing him into a life in which they could not provide for or protect him. He's prompted by his mother's proud announcement that she's pregnant again, adding to her innumerable horde of children, all unregistered, unfed, uneducated, the disdained doomed.\nThe trial scenes are intercut with the events that led up to it. His father expels Zain for interfering with his sister being sold into marriage. The boy finds refuge with an illegal Somali refugee Rahil. He tends to her infant son Yonas while she works. When Rahil is arrested for her lapsed ID Zain struggles to care for Yonas. He's ultimately forced to let a Lebanese trafficker sell the baby.\nFor 126 minutes the film displays a gripping sweep of suffering. There is not a moment of drag or boredom. The cityscape looks like a giant warehouse crammed with storage boxes. There is little evidence of any living creatures enjoying any life. The humans we meet are locked into either selfish or desperate improvisations of escape and exploitation. All the actors are unprofessionals living out variations on real experience. If the merciful happy ending seems a bit miraculous, thus witnessing these people' suffering has earned us that relief.\nThe film is full of images and situations we haven't seen before. In one, Zain draws on his unsteady experience and observation to teach his sister how to deal with her first period. He wants her to conceal so her parents won't sell her into marriage.\nWhen he's forced to steal a bottle of milk from a sleeping baby, Ionas tastes and refuses it, then drops off - it's been drugged. Even the less suffering have their afflictions and desperation.\nWhen Rahil is under arrest, she begs her absent baby's forgiveness when she milks herself in her jail cell, to relieve the pressure. This entire drama is the milk of human unkindness.\nIn court Zain's parents are allowed their moments of sympathy. Unregistered, unacknowledged, helpless and hopeless, they resign themselves to perpetuating their cycle of suffering. Neither knows the simplest self-respect at even the thin end of the spectrum of white privilege. \"We're ants,\" says the father, so why let Zain go to school when he could be working for the man who will wed and waste the girl.\nOf course this Lebanon story speaks to the suffering and torment throughout the world's third world countries, the disenfranchised and the despairing, to which Donald Trump's attack on refugees and asylum seekers has also plunged America.\nThe film's title means Chaos. But make no mistake: this film is not about the apparent chaos. It's about the World Order so uncaring for the world's suffering as to nourish that chaos.\nTwo recent news items shadowed my consideration of this film.\n(i) Hundreds of millions of dollars have been offered to help the penurious Catholic Church restore its infernal Notre Dame cathedral. Right. Build the edifice and ignore the suffering. That's what Jesus would say. Let a symbol override humanity,\n(ii)Disney CEO Bob Iger's salary was $65.6 million in 2018. And that paled beside Discovery CEO David Zaslaw's one-year salary of $129.4 million. Those are one year salaries.\nThis is the World Order. This callousness sustains the chaos this film exposes so heart-rendingly",

Let's start from the things that I did like - Zain's acting was really solid, the film is pretty well-shot and edited, and I did enjoy to an extent from some parts of the story. And yeah, the Ethiopian baby is cute. That's about it.Now, this film has a big problem. One big, fat, unignorable problem - it's super shallow. Yes, I was somewhat invested on Zain's character. He went through hard things, and it's pretty hard to not feel anything. But this film - from its message, the way it's portrayed to the characters, there's nothing there whatsoever. If I was to compare Capernaum to another film, it would be to Bicycle Thieves, but while BT succeeds in communicating an interesting message, portraying a layered problem and telling a pretty interesting story, Capernaum just throws at you that hard lives of Zain and that's about it.So, to conclude it all - the film didn't make me suffer. It was pretty good on the technical level, and the plot isn't bad, but when digging into it it turns out to be quite shallow and not that interesting. Feeling a 5.7 on this one.",

            "content": "I saw \"Capernaum\" at a small theater in Manchester, Vermont and was captivated by the film making, and by the story. Capernaum is a Lebanese film (English subtitles) about a ~12 year old boy barely getting by in the slums, who runs away from his large disjointed family, and finds marginal shelter with an undocumented Ethiopian woman and her infant. The boy is later jailed for attacking an older man who forcibly wed the boys sister. The Ethiopian woman is likewise jailed pending deportation, while her infant son is sold off into a baby trafficking ring. It's a sad story about life and hope in extraordinary poverty, and it's told with brilliantly raw cinematography and invisible acting by a solid cast of non-actors. Capernaum is a mostly bleak film that takes a small positive turn at the end, which left the entire audience in stunned silence, and several theatergoers crying in the lobby. It's also an important film about global culture, human trafficking, poverty, and hope. Capernaum is an important film every First-World American should experience.",

There have been several noteworthy films of kids surviving in slums - \"Pixote\", \"Slumdog Millionaire\", \"City of God\", \"Children Underground\", and many others, and \"Capernaum\" fits strongly in that line pf must see films.

            "content": "This movie conveys a powerful message that was delivered with a perfect pace, cinematography and acting. The main idea here is obvious yet often overlooked by lots of parents in the middle east, that's (if you are unable to provide a healthy and prosperous life for your children, then don't ever think of having them!) It addresses this issue that many children here have, that they are unable to go to schools, have a proper education and normal childhood, because of some greedy-a$$ parents who believe that having more children will increase there chances of getting a better life, as their children will help them, by doing what? By not going to schools and joining the workforce at early ages.I just can't emphasize how children exploitation is a severe issue that lots of countries suffer from, you may blame the political climate in which these families found themselves live in, yes but can you answer me why on earth, like why in god's sizzling damn hell, would underprivileged parents bring lots of children into this world? When was having one child, two maximum, not enough? Why would a man who is unable to eat, or to provide for himself let alone his family, breed so much that he brings dozens of children into this world, other than for his own selfishness and greed! As he brings them to be his life long employees! Why wouldn't he thinks about his children future!This movie addresses this concept that many Arab parents have very well, the whole movie is well directed and touching, it surely deserves to be watched, to think about the children we find on our streets who beg for simple life essentials, and us to respect and appreciate the little things that we take for granted. This movie is a must watch.",

The Cinematography, editing, & stark performances are so natural & seamless, that it feels more real than a documentary. I spent most of the film in tears & shame; utterly oblivious & distraught as to the conditions which probably a very large portion of the population are expected to survive in. Where families are so demoralized they would sell their own children to wealthy paedophiles - who think that 11 year old girls are fit to bare children themselves. Where parents despise their young for costing them what little they have until such age of cultural or social-economic arrangement. The suffering, desperation, & decay is all so many have to thrive in. There are moments where people accomplish commendable acts of kindness & are punished for it as a result of such a cut throat environment. It demonstrates the dictatorship & oppression of a monetary system so obsolete, that it is no longer fit for purpose. Our ancestors lived healthier by comparison, when nature could provide, & not a single child on the planet was locked up by laws created by lesser men. When papers & Passports weren't worth more than life itself. I feel that this film is mostly educational, but is of modern credibility & relevancy where slavery, our devolution, & cultural retrograde are concerned. I am not surprised that this film won no \"British\" or \"American\" film awards; falling upon deaf ears, denial & depreciation of even subtitles, let alone other cultures. But the rest world comprehended it with ease & aptitude. This film is a masterpiece, & puts Hollywood to shame for the billions they blow on frivolous over glamourized trite commercials for all their depth. And it solidifies the heart rending struggles in the eastern world in paying the price for our excessive lifestyles of mono-mania & gluttony. The most universal film I have seen for what can only be described as an eternity. My only regret is that every human on the planet hasn't watched it.",

            "content": "In the early chapters of my life, Lebanon was an elusive figure of my imagination. Being born and raised in Toronto, I would hear stories of my homeland from my cousins, uncles and grandmothers. From their descriptions of the countryside, my homeland played in my mind like a fantastic Wild West; the stories always had an underlying sense that the country was a type of Eden, a magical place with magical people, a gem placed perfectly in the midst of chaos.When I made my first trip to the country I was twelve years old. My familial roots trace back to the northern part of the country to a town called Joub Janine in a region known as the Beqaa Valley which is nestled right below the currently devastatingly war-torn Syria. My experiences were life altering; a colossal shift to my consciousness occurred about the world we live in and how that sucker spins, how you can enter a world so electric and alien to your own world with just a 12 hour flight by plane.My first visit due to age was made up of primarily the country's decadent cuisine and visits to my family.I went back at the age of seventeen with my brother for three weeks, and it was then that my Wild West fantasy began to take true form in reality. Streets cross each other making a labyrinth of life, electric lines lay over and under and all around each other, looming above the streets like a friendly spider's web. The youth is passionate and wild, full of life and wisdom gathered from their surroundings complete with beautiful flowing hair and beautifully wrapped Hijabs rest on the woman as they socialize, smoking tobacco out of hookah pipes that give off the most fragrant of aromas. This aroma follows you, like the sun that stays on your shoulders with strength, or the full flavored tobacco that wafts through the streets and barber shop. The barber shop that is run by a man who's lost his tongue in the war yet he still knows just what you want from your hand signals. Lebanese like to use their hands when they talk, they throw them down towards the floor like they are letting go of weights and point as if they were being cut from a Tintin comic strip. Firearms are readily available and commonplace yet no one ever shoots each other, they are carried for their destined use of protection, and perhaps the occasional couple of discharges in the many farm fields of the country. Seatbelts are ignored and so are road signs, if any, yet everyone seems to get along just fine. Some ride in German automobiles while some entire families ride on one motorized scooter, newborns and all.Capernaum, the newest film by Nadine Labaki shows just how exceptionally talented the renowned Lebanese auteur is at capturing that land that holds my heart, and hers as well. Her style is, if comparable, reminiscent of the flavour of Larry Clark's Kids, with a dash of Paul Greengrass's Green Zone, and many hints of Vittorio Di Sica's brilliant Umberto D. The film is poignant; revolving completely around the world of a twelve-year old boy named Zain (Zain Al Rafeea). He lives in a steamy, crammed apartment with his band of siblings, and neglectful mother (Fadi Yousef) and father (Kawsar Al Haddad) in a war-torn neighborhood in Beirut. His parents out of devastating desperation give their daughter to the landlord of their building in hopes of leniency with their payment of rent, an act that naturally enrages Zain, causing him to run away from his family into the abyss of Beirut.In his journey of self-preservation destiny he meets an Ethiopian migrant worker Rahil (Yordanos Shiferaw). Rahil has an infant child of her own name Yonas (Boluwatife Treasure Bankole), who gives such a contribution to the organic documentary inspired style that is truly remarkable. Rahil takes Zain under her care for some time providing some of the most beautifully shot scenes of intimacy in cinema over the past little while. The film's heart is transcended through Zain and Yonas; their acting is so poetic, watching these two children interact, with the slightest of movements, give elusive kinetic energy that never feels premeditated in the slightest.Drama ultimately knocks on the films door and heartbreak occurs with Zain climatically commits a violent act causing him to stand in court with his parents. He declares hatred for his parents and seeks justice for them giving him life when they have no intention to properly love or care for him, as well as his siblings. This embodies the idea of Capernaum which is according to Libaki \"to give a voice to children who otherwise do not have one.\"I have watched a select couple of brief scenes from Labaki's previous films, yet never have I seen one in its entirety and this was quite the film to start me off. The opening sequence is melodious; we see Zain with a number of other children, horse playing through the tangles of flights of stairs and street corners of the neighborhood. Labaki takes this moment to transport the audience above an electrical wire of neighbourhoods to a bird's eye shot, tracking the kids as they gallop down streets in true Federico Fellini 8 \u00bd fashion, already showing Lebanon for what it is, a very dreamlike place. The delicate cocktail of human perspective documentary styled shots and sweeping wide-panning crane shots is absolutely fascinating and more than simply tasteful to the eye, it is transcending. The editing is psychedelic, completed masterfully by Konstantin Bock and Laure Gardette. During the introduction to the screening of the film it was said that filming had taken a year, and the editing process had actually taken the same amount of time. After watching the film it is quite obvious as to why it is such, it plays so naturally and voyeur in nature yet the story is absolutely engaging and just as strong as a destined plot driven production with seamless cutting from one physical place to another or one action to another in the more energized scenes. The palette of colours is gorgeous, with the sandy browns and vivid greens of the country effortlessly gracing the lens, operated by the very talented Christopher Aoun. The occasionally shaky yet simultaneously delicate sweep of Aoun's camera paired with Labaki's eye for the absolute accurate atmosphere of the country is where the film truly finds its class. Her method of seeming to let Lebanon function as a society while around her, and simultaneously filming these occurrences, in true fly on the wall filming style, is so effective at showing the beauty and despair this country harbours. The pair do not sensationalize, they simply observe.Although Labaki and Aoun absolutely shine in this film with their talents, we have seen films with similar concepts of documentary inspired emotion driven pictures, the real ultra-light in Capernaum comes from the films lead Zain. During my second visit to the country, I recall sitting on a roof one star-lit evening and looking to the north of us to Syria where we could see rockets and artillery punishing the land, the embers and matter from these vehicles of death flaring up the sky. I thought to myself at that moment how it would be to if it was me in that situation; if my family were only that much more north how devastating my life could have been.Zain Al Rafeea is actually a Syrian refugee, making his performance all the more impactful, genuine and tear summoning. Zain is the rarest portrayal of passion; through his depiction, one can easily see the infinite wisdom that has been added to his soul through his eyes as he stares into the camera, the natural wisdom given to those who have seen the hellish things he has seen. It is quite heartbreaking while brilliant all in the same; his bravado and way with words put him right up to par if not past his much older and experienced peers in Hollywood, an absolute diamond in the rough of an actor who took my expectations and surpassed them tenfold.Capernaum is an emotional wave that washes and continues to wash over you. I walked out of this film like I had witnessed a ghost. The epiphany of raw, no-holds-barred talented filmmaking. Capernaum is passion, Capernaum is struggle, Capernaum is love, beauty, and chaos. Capernaum is Lebanon.",

The boy has one outstanding trait, compassion for the lost child. He suffers hideous deprivations to keep this child alive and relatively safe. He doesn't know about the cataclysmic events that are playing out around him. All is pain. It is a marvel that anyone in this story can bear to go on. They do and the chaos just keeps going.

That is right off the bat an absurd idea. To start with his parents are dirt poor so good luck with that. His claim is that life is so bad he'd rather never been born. He believes his life is worthless. This however is not true because we see him greatly improving the lives of others throughout the film. I don't like this idea that so many people seem to share these days that life is meaningless and unimportant. Life especially human life is very important. Each and every one of us has a place and a purpose whether you realize it or not. I am so grateful for the people I have in my life. No life should be taken for granted.",

People should get a proper education and a minimum wage to live with. Teaching poor people that making more kids won't make their life better, but quite the opposite.

When Sahar (Izzam), his closest 11-year-old sister, is married off to their landlord Assad (El Husseini), Zain runs away and fetches up in an amusement park, soon is taken in by a sympathetic young Ethiopian single mother Rahil (Shiferaw), so Zain can look after her baby Yonas when she goes to work. After Rahil is nicked for her undocumented migrant status, Zain takes on the parental job in his own hands before doleful reality catches up on him, he eventually caves in and exchanges Yonas for money to buy a quota to be smuggled out of the country (a heart-rending manifestation shows even with steely resolution, the impoverished Zain must do the same like his parents under dire circumstances), only stricken by another tragic hammer blow which prompts his transgression of stabbing a \"son of bitch\", Zain is sentenced in jail for 5 years.The film starts in medias res when Zain is seen in court suing his parents of child neglect, then Labaki's tactical guerrilla-style flashback kicks in with a visceral immediacy and poignancy, cleaving to Zain's viewpoint until the rousing moment, when he vehemently pleads that his parents shouldn't be allowed to have more children, a blunt anti-natalism statement addressing the elephant in the room, especially following Souad's desperate defense of \"you cannot judge me if you are not in my shoes\", in this case, actually we can, no matter whose shoes we are in, some blatant benightedness must be severely censured, it is somewhat less plausible Labaki puts the words in Zain's mouth other than delegating it to his lawyer Nadine, downplayed by herself. Ironically, in reality, the actor Zain is vouchsafed a Norwegian passport after the movie's success, and his family is resettled in Norway now, ergo, there are real-life miracles like that spur poverty-ridden household prone to procreation, in case one of the offspring will become their savior, out of wretchedness, people would put faith in anything, however slim the chances are. It goes without saying that the canker lies in a larger context, the thorny immigrant issue is given a harsh once-over in real prisons with detained refugees, and Labaki also flags up the issues in the legal system (both allowing a minor to buy prescribed medicine and an underaged girl to enter matrimony should be put paid to).Not without its flaws (the plot is constituted of predictable mishaps piled upon unceremoniously to flog its sensible message to death, and its happy ending tends to feel cavalier), CAPERNAUM finds another wow factor in its amateur cast, Yordanos Shiferaw is especially touching in expressing sorrow and natural goodwill, whereas the extraordinary Zain Al Rafeea, whose down-in-the-mouth resilience magnificently reflects his suppressed ire singeing just beneath the surface, culminates his engrossing performance with a transcendent smile perfectly bringing down the curtain on a confidently wrought social reportage that dares to offer an unflinching look on the abject underbelly of a hand-to-mouth existence.",

            "content": "'Capernaum', the extraordinary film by Lebanese Nadine Labaki that won the Jury Prize at Cannes in 2018 and was nominated for an Academy Award for best film in a foreign language immediately reminds cinema lovers of the most impressive sequences from Italian neo-realism cinema, filmed immediately after World War II, but also films such as Hirokazu Koreeda's 'Shoplifters' depicting the social media plunged into poverty in today's world. The main difference is that those films - inspired and well documented as they are - are still works of fiction, and most of the performers are professional actors. In 'Capernaum' filming is done right in the slums of Beirut, and the actors are mostly real people who come directly from that environment, some of them illegal immigrants, and what they play on screen are their own lives or something very similar. The story of the making of the movie 'Capernaum' could be as interesting as the story in the film itself. Between fiction and documentary, 'Capernaum' is much closer to documentary, even if it retains a fictional narrative with a very original starting idea.Nadina Labaki's film offers an immersive experience in the life of Zain, a 12-year-old boy living on the streets of Beirut. The family is so poor that they don't even have the money to enroll their children, and they live outside of any education, health or social care system. The boy works as a helper and porter at a shop and learns to survive on the streets of the city. When her parents decide to sell her 11-year-old sister in a forced marriage in exchange for a few chickens, Zain resists (unsuccessfully), revolts and runs away from home. He will be sheltered by an illegal immigrant from Ethiopia, in exchange for help in caring for a one-year-old child, and he will also be a child without an identity. When she disappears (arrested by the immigration authorities) Zain will have to survive alone with her little boy. Arriving in prison, he decides to sue his parents for giving birth to him.The narrative structure seems chaotic, but in fact it is just a reflection of the lives of the heroes. All the filming is authentic, being done in the poorest neighborhoods of a city hit by poverty and wars, where every new day is a new attempt. Poverty and hunger are a constant threat and there seems to be no public or social framework to help these people, especially the children whose fates seem to be determined by birth. Nadine Labaki manages to put into action at best the actors who play their own lives on screen. The amazing lead actor, Zain Al Rafeea, is a Syrian refugee kid who found refuge in Sweden after filming. The atmosphere is overwhelming, and the authentic footage gives the film the power of a documentary, amplified by an emotional life story. At no point did I have the feeling of the director exploiting the situation of the film's heroes, and this may be because the cinematic treatment is doubled by empathy and uses a style that reflects the point of view of the character. 'Capernaum' offers its viewers a social and human document that deserves all the attention.",

Some people are thinking this is exaggerated but it's not, it is painfully true!\nThe acting was amazing as well especially the kid who is the main character.\nHowever Labaki stressed through the final scenes that the fault of all this misery lies on the hands of the parents having too many children. That is a really naive argument reducing failed governments, corruption, inequality and a flawed world order into a problem of parents having too many children.\nI am not sure if she actually meant that or not but showing the mother to be pregnant again stresses that point which is shame.\nIt can't be denied that poor parents having many children is a problem but it is a minuscule issue when looking at the more complex reasons for poverty.\nIt's a shame that she wasted such a compassionate effort on such a shallow conclusion.",

Listen carefully all of you, It's time to forget whatever child centric films and classics you have seen because Capernaum has cracked an unbelievable formula beyond your imagination. Yes. Every child centric Classic is suddenly looking like a lower content film to me, why? Because Capernaum has done something higher than highest. It's a story of a 12 years old child who sues his parents for giving him birth. He asks all adults to listen to him and says, why do you give birth to childs if you are not able to rise them carefully? Can you believe it? Such a mind shattering concept it is. It is unbelievable to accept but we gotta accept it because everything you see in the film is actually happening all around the world. I have question for all Movie Buffs out there, tell me why is it always Foreign Language Cinema cracking mind shaking universal concept? I hope we never get answer of this question and they keep making it to give us some special films. The writing of Capernaum does the big job already but it is the overall presentation which makes it look a Masterpiece in all Cinematic proportions. I don't believe how those child actors acted so naturally and so real? I just couldn't differentiate whether they are acting in front of camera or living the slum life in real. Even that Little kid who couldn't even speak gave all shots perfectly, i mean how? So, Zain Al Rafeea is the name of the leading child actor, i gotto remember this name for some time and may be forever. That smile he gave in the last frame is been stamped on my heart. Nadine Labaki did something unachievable thing with Capernaum. Most of the directors fail to take proper shots with adult artist and then Labaki shot a Cinematic Masterpiece with Children. Capernaum is a MUST SEE if you have Appetit for High Quality Cinema.RATING - 9/10*By - #samthebestest",

It is not only a story about refugees and the Middle East crisis although that is the back drop - it is a story about the worst of the human condition. When people are in abject poverty they are capable of losing their humanity to survive - Capernaum is brave enough to show the brutality, the degradation, the poverty, the starvation, the loss of human integrity and does not spare the details - but it also shows the slivers of light that permeate the terrible darkness. At the heart of all this is ignorance - a seething quagmire of ignorance made worse by war and loss of identity. Important questions are raised; why do some people in the midst of such misery find the will to survive and never lose their ability to give love and why do others only feed off misery in parasitic mode. Children are the hope of the future and this film enforces their innate wisdom and ability to survive against the odds.",

            "content": "Capharnaum is the little foreign film that could, becoming the highest grossing Arabic and Middle-Eastern film of all-time at the world wide box office as well as garnering attention with prestigious nominations for the likes of the Cannes Palme d'Or and a spot in this year's Oscar nominations for Best Foreign film.It's an incredible feat for a film with a budget of $4 million dollars, a lead in the form of the astonishingly good child actor Zain Al Rafeea (who had never acted previously) and the direction of Lebanese actress/director Nadine Labaki and when you consider just how hard hitting and confronting Capharnaum is, its story of success is even more incredible.Pulling no punches and showcasing the bleak and horrifying situations that exist in the country of Lebanon, here centred around Al Refeea's 12 year old but wise above his years Zain and his quest to sue his atrocious parents for neglect after he finds himself impressed for a crime that we begin to understand more of thanks to the films flashback nature, Capharnaum is a unique, eye-opening and emotionally strong drama that will stick with you long after the credits have rolled.Putting the weight of the films ambitions on the shoulders of Rafeea, Labaki has here found herself in charge of one of the most fully-formed and carefully considered child performances of the decade, with Zain a multi-layered child on the verge of teenage hood that is dealing with situations that he should never have found himself in.Tackling the poverty of Lebanon, the racism, the arranged marriage issue and the over-crowded prison/justice system, Capharnaum's character study of an unfortunate child harbors much within its narrative surrounds, that it becomes a film filled the heart and soul of a country that finds itself dealing with more than its fair share of problems that deserve the discussion that will come from watching a film as memorable as this.There's been many a film that tackles a child placed in a situation that is beyond their years and experience, such as the great Australian backed Lion or foreign gem The Rocket but Capharnaum excels in this area with Zain's journey from mischievous street kid to makeshift parent figure a harrowing one and one that feels natural and plausible thanks to Rafeea's turn and Labaki's direction, that is enhanced by some stunning cinematography by Christopher Aoun and moody score by Khaled Mouzanar, that helps make it a real cinematic delight in scale and scope despite the intimate nature of the story at the films heart.By the film's heart-warming final frame, you're well aware that what you've watched is a beautiful human tale, filled with despair, loss and sadness but also scattered love, laughter and kindness, a rare type of film that will stay relevant for many years still yet to come.Final Say -This critical lauded and heavily awarded foreign drama deserves its raft of high praise that currently sees it sitting pretty in the highly sought after IMDB Top 250. With a truly mezmorizing performance from its young star Zain Al Rafeea front and centre, Capharnaum may be tough viewing at times thanks to its subject matter but a film you won't be able to turn away from or forget in a hurry.4 \u00bd ice cubes out of 5",

            "content": "\"Capernaum\" (2018 release from Lebanon; 126 min.) brings the story of Zain, a young boy in Beirut. As the movie opens, he is being examined by a doctor, who observes \"he's lost his baby teeth, he's probably 12 or 13 yrs. old\" (Zain looks younger than that). Next, Zain is being led, in handcuffs, to a court hearing. We quickly understand that Zain is serving a 5 year prison sentence for stabbing someone, but that Zain is now suing his parents \"because I was born\". We then go back in time and get to know Zain and his family, including his many siblings, as we start to watch how things have unfolded. At this point we are less than 15 min. into the movie, but to tell you more of the plot would spoil your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.Couple of comments: this is the latest film directed by Lebanese actress Nadine Labaki, whose previous work includes the equally great \"Where Do We Go Now?\" Here Labaki (who also co-wrote the script) brings the story of how a young boy tries to survive in an urban jungle that is Beirut. The movie is plot-heavy so I won't say more. Instead let me just heap a lot of praise onto Labaki and her team for making such a deeply moving and, frankly, equally haunting, film. Some of the scenes will absolutely rip your heart out (check out for example what happens to Zain's sister Sahar...). But the highest praise surely goes to the young actor who portrays Zain. He is so natural and authentic, it simply blew m away.\"Capernaum\" premiered at last year's Cannes film festival to immediate and universal acclaim (winning the Jury Prize along the way), and a few weeks ago it deservedly snagged an Oscar nomination for Best Foreign Language movie, although I'm afraid that It cannot beat \"Roma\" (which for me was the best movie of 2018, period). It doesn't even matter, frankly. I saw \"Capernaum\" this past weekend. The Sunday early evening screening was attended so-so (about 10 people), but hopefully the positive word of mouth this movie surely generates can build a larger audience over time. I encourage you to check it out, be it in the theater, on VOD, or eventually on DVD/Blu-ray, and draw your own conclusion.",

            "review_title": "Voice of the Voiceless",
            "content": "They are children of the streets. You can see them in the slums and marginalized neighborhoods of every major city in the world - begging, selling trinkets or other wares, carrying heavy loads for some uncaring employer, or just hanging out. Without papers that prove their identity, they cannot go to school, find work, qualify for a passport, or even receive treatment at a hospital in case of emergency. Many do not know when or where they were born and have never celebrated a birthday. Winner of the Jury Prize at the 2018 Cannes Film Festival and one of five films nominated for Best Foreign Language Film at the Golden Globes, Lebanese director Nadine Labaki's (\"Where Do We Go Now?\") masterful and deeply affecting Capernaum focuses on the street kids of Beirut, Lebanon whose daily life is marked by a struggle to survive against odds stacked against them.The film's title refers to a \"disorderly accumulation of objects,\" a name appropriate for children who are regarded as objects, not people. Labaki spent years researching the film by talking to hundreds of children and their parents, often visiting detention centers and areas of the city off-limits to the public. One of her conclusions is that some people should not be parents. \"I would go into these shacks,\" she says, \"and see kids who were left alone all day. You start to ask yourself, what kind of mother leaves her child alone, with nothing to eat for the entire day? I would see a mother breastfeeding tenderly\" she says, \"and then minutes later, she would turn around and smack her child.\" The main focus of the film, however, is on Zain (Zain al Rafeea), a Lebanese boy of uncertain age who looks like eight but is thought to be twelve. He is serving a five-year sentence for stabbing a victim whom he describes as a \"sonofabitch,\" much to the judge's (Elias Khoury) consternation.Represented by his lawyer (Labeki), Zain is suing his parents, mother Souad (Kawsar Al Haddad) and father Selim (Fadi Kamel Youssef), for bringing him into the world without being able to offer any affection or adequately provide for his care or safety. As Zain, al Rafeea is not only a charismatic actor but an authentic one, a boy who, as a Syrian refugee, has been working as a delivery boy since age 10, living through similar traumas faced by his character in the film. Capernaum opens in a courtroom. As the scruffy, foul-mouthed boy is led into the room in handcuffs, we are taken back to events leading up to the present moment. While the lawsuit at first appears frivolous, the heartbreaking story that ensues makes it seem reasonable. Running errands for a local shopkeeper, taking part in his family's scheme to sell the drug Tramadol to prison inmates, and taking care of his many brothers and sisters, Zain knows nothing about the joys that childhood has to offer.Especially close to his 11-year-old sister, Sahar (Cedra Izam), he is distraught when she is sold into marriage and runs away headed for a town near the beach. On the bus, a strange-looking man (Joseph Jimbazian) dressed in a Spider-man costume (calling himself Cockroach-man) leads him to a raunchy amusement park. It is here that he meets undocumented Ethiopian immigrant Rahil (Yordanos Shiferaw) and her one-year-old son Yonas (Boluwatife Treasure Bankole), a child she keeps hidden from her employer and the authorities for fear of deportation. Working to save enough money to buy a new forged ID card from the sleazy trader Aspro (Alaa Chouchnieh), Rahil shows kindness by bringing the hungry Zain to her ramshackle home.Here she provides free room and board for his service as a babysitter for Yonas, whom he passes off as his brother (irrespective of the difference in their skin color which he attributes to his mother drinking too much coffee when she was pregnant). Though Zain cannot escape his impoverished circumstances, in bonding with Yonas, he finds that touch of caring that has always eluded him. When Rahil disappears after a visit to Aspro, however, a heartbroken Zain has to care for the little boy by himself, once again taking to the streets, wheeling Yonas around in a makeshift cart built from a skateboard and a cooking pot. Under the guidance of cinematographer Christopher Aoun (\"Kalveli: Shadows of the Desert\"), it is an indelible image.Reinforced by Khaled Mouzanar's haunting score, Capernaum touches a universal chord. Like the biblical city of the same name where, according to the New Testament, miraculous healing took place, the film does not wallow in misery but offers a glimmer of hope and a common humanity. While it is dark and often hard to watch, Capernaum gives us the opportunity to listen to the \"voice of the voiceless.\" It is a voice that must be heard.",

They just resorted to the easy way: compiling stereotypes and prejudices. And holding people accountable for their own poverty without any mention to the political and social system's failure. And I am really disappointed because I really liked Nadine's previous movies.\nRegarding the actors (if we can call them actors), people thought they were fabulous. For me (and I am not belittling what they did, don't get me wrong), they were living their daily life in front of the camera. The greatness of an actor is measured by the way he could embody someone he is not.... And obviously that's not the case here.\nThe spectator is left lost in front of all the babel-like movie. If we don't like it, we think we're incapable of empathy. But we need to go beyond this self-guilt as spectators. Let's just evaluate it as a movie.

You get a true feel for the living conditions.Zain has a good heart and does not put himself first when he is stuck with the baby.The end scene where Zain gets his identity is emotional.Having identification is something most humans with it take for granted and don't even think about it and this film really hits home how important having it is.A true Masterpiece and a must watch.",

Absolutely heart wrenching movie that talks about so many things that it will take hours to write down.

            "content": "Thanks to director Nadine Labaki, who takes us on a tour to a parallel world which is way different from the one that we live in. Poverty is devastating, whichever shade it belongs, Capharna\u00fcm takes us on a journey towards the worst shade of poverty that one gets to see. The story is seen through the eyes of a 12 year old boy, Zain living with his huge family in an impoverished neighbourhood in the suburbs of Beirut, Lebanon. Zain gives the audiences the world over, a sneak peek of a few days of his life in about a couple of hours. There is a parallel story of an illegal Ethiopian immigrant, Rahil and her cute little son Yonas, which merges with the story of Zain. Capharna\u00fcm is a gentle reminder to ourselves to understand how much of a privileged life we are living. The character of Zain is an inspiration to all of us to fight for what we truly deserve in life. Innocence Lost is a crime too but who is responsible? The Society? The Government? The Corporates? The Corrupt? or the entire system?Fantastic work from director Nadine Labaki touches an emotional cord within us with such a moving story. Outstanding Cinematography was the main reason for Capharna\u00fcm to have a soul on its own, ably supported by some very good editing to keep the liner story moving on beautifully. Production design, Costumes and make up team really must have worked hard enough to give the top notch authentic feel throughout the movie. Shooting in real locations amongst real people were a little amateurish at times as a lot of people were peeping into the camera, so were some supporting actors, many whom couldn't handle emotions very well. Music however little it was, sounded excellent, so did the sound mixing.Considering the very delicate subject of poverty and abuse, Capharna\u00fcm kindles our inner feelings to the core in every possible way. It makes us to understand the privileges that we get in our lives has to enjoyed without any complains. Poverty is the worst disease human beings can endure and humanity is the cure for it. A must watch movie for all ages to understand the hardships of life and poverty.",

            "content": "Inhabitants of a capitalist universe, it is natural that, when we go to the movies, we marvel at the wonders that reveal where the capital is. Capernaum subverts this logic by showing or practically spilling on the screen where capital is not.People who stay on the fringes of income distribution are commonly called \"economically vulnerable\". The film does not stop at political or moral issues, but makes clear that if there is vulnerability in the world, none is greater than that experienced by children.Zain is a boy of about 12 years old (not even the parents know when he was born) getting handcuffed in a court in Beirut. We imagine that it is \"naturally\" some kind of delinquency that \"this kind of people\" commits. However, through the narratives, we find that it does not. He has been serving time already for a few years for stabbing a man. What is involved here is a lawsuit, proposed by the boy, against his parents for having committed the \"crime\" of placing him in the world.The film is a succession of flashbacks that (do not) explain Zain's story but draw a profile of the children's universe in a place where they come to the world trough a religious discourse that masks an odd evil of parents. Ignorant, addicted, and slothful, they do not care a minute worrying about their children's fate. They do not know when they were born, where they are, they do not send them to school, and if an opportunity for profit arises, they do not mind \"raffling off\" a younger daughter into the ubiquitous lust of human predators.Fleeing from home, Zain receives, perhaps for the first time in his life, a bit of affection and attention from an illegal Ethiopian immigrant Rahil and goes on to take care of her son, the toddler Yonas, who, due to her mother's arrest, becomes a mission of life for the boy.Zain becomes a hero: he becomes gigantic, resilient, he invents unbelievable strategies. However, villains are many, some because they hunt, others because they do not care, others because they deny reality. Victory is impossible, just as this world legion of heroes is disposable.",

            "content": "This might be the most overwhelmingly powerful film I've ever seen about children. I was briefly overcome by it, which is unusual for me. With this tale of Zain, an existence-battered boy who sues his parents for the cruelty of giving him life, writer-director-actress Nadine Labaki has created a cinema-as-cry-of-anguish.Labaki and DP Christopher Aoun depict contemporary Beirut as a beautiful, swirling hell in which humans, constantly afflicted by scarcity, turn to their most predatory instincts to survive one another's attacks. Seemingly only the most violent and pugnacious instincts can be nurtured in the world depicted in this film. And one senses no impulse towards social reform on the part of the filmmakers. No solution is offered or even suggested. This social order seems to be merely a reflection of the true nature of the human beast. It is surprising and unexplainable, then, that part of this nature is the impulse to care about one another (even if this does not translate into the ability to care for one another) and to, against the character's own stated wishes, remain alive.The non-actor who is the lead performer, Zain Al Rafeea, a Syrian immigrant who has indeed grown up on the streets of Beirut, doesn't so much play the character as inhabit it. One senses that Labaki found someone who, as with Pierre Blaise as the titular character in Malle's \"Lacombe, Lucien\", actually was the character they were being asked to portray. The complete authenticity of Al Rafeea's behavior rescues the script from a potential problem. The misfortunes of the characters are so numerous and extreme that if the performances had any shade of artificiality the story might have started to seem ridiculous, like an out-of-control Thomas Hardy tale.One finds oneself simultaneously wanting to look away from Zain because the suffering seems so legitimate, and unable to look away. Some morbidly curious part of ourselves wants to try to read in the child's face the horrors that he probably has, in fact, witnessed. When it comes time for Zain to denounce life itself, we sense that the words are coming from the performer as much as the character. This makes them both more piercing, and more cathartic.Watching Capernaum, I found myself comparing it to two American films about harsh childhoods: the surprisingly gritty Hollywood adaptation Precious, and Sean Baker's spectacular indie, The Florida Project. I judge Capernaum to be clearly superior to the former and slightly inferior to the latter. Precious was ultimately, despite its bleak subject matter, a Hollywood film. Every scene was one of despair or hope, as if the two were mutually exclusive, with the resulting dialectic of course ultimately putting hope on top. Labaki does acknowledge moments of playfulness and empathy even in the hellish depths of her film's world. But her characters are totally at the mercy of the material reality around them. In that way, Capernaum is less complex than Baker's film, which subtly switches from the realist-objective to the expressionistic-subjective to show how the human imagination, despite all that besieges it, manages to create moments of beauty from the world around it. Labaki perhaps attempts such a thing in a scene where Zain finds himself in an amusement park, but this scene is the only false-note in the film. It comes off as a tired art-film cliche or a wholly unnecessary \"hommage\" to canonnical art films of the 1950s and 1960s.I think this is a very fine work of art. I'm glad it was made and am happy I had the chance to see it. I am, however, sympathetic to those who might reject the film. For it dares to ask, \"Is the ordeal of human existence worth while?\" Given the conclusion it seems to me it undeniably arrives at, some might fairly say, \"Better not to have asked the question.\"",

It is the catchy element in the movie and the rest of the visuals draw us into the clear picture of what Zain talked about. Zian is surrounded by a lot of siblings and his father and mother are planning for another baby. His life condition (which means his family's life condition) is worse in the sense they don't even care about their children. Zain doing a job in a provision store near his dilapidated house and he earns for his family. Ho doesn't even get an education not even his siblings too. That pathetic condition is clear in each and every corner of the movie. When his sister (she achieved puberty now) put up in the swirl of marriage Zian fought against his father and mother and then he eloped from his family. From there on, the cinema attains an emotional dimension deeply. When Zain babysits Rihal's (an Ethiopean lady who is doing multi-tasking jobs) toddler, Yohan he feels some kind of security and protection from there. Even though Rihal is living more pathetically than Zian lived, Zian adjusts to the situation and he gets love to care for the first time in his life. He looks after Yohan as his brother. On an occasion when he questions himself about the color of Yohan and him (because Zian is white), he states that while Yohan was pregnant his mother drank a lot more coffee. Likewise, that kind of innocence can be seen in the attitude of Zian, but actually, he doesn't know how to show it. You can see Zian smiling only at the end of the movie. In that way, Capernaum flows exactly as chaos and that's why Zian filed a case against his parents to bring him into this chaotic world. Capernaum shed our tears, it'll stay back in our minds and disturb us, and also it will glow upon our souls and resounds how lucky we are.",

They do not even have blankets, or their own separate beds. I do not want to give too much away, but I must say that this is a beautiful, profound film.

Don't think of it as a blood hell movie people just killing each other for no realistic reasons. But brutally realistic.The movie takes place in Lebanon. You may have heard something about how worthless human lives are in Arab countries. But hearing is simply not enough. This movie takes you to there and makes you live in the streets. Misery is everywhere. People are starving and everybody needs to think of theyselves because otherwise they will starve too. But they still continue to breed with incredible speed. This situation has its own reasons (which are compelitely unacceptable). But you know, you can't really understand it until you live it. The kid sues his parents for making him. He literally prefers not exist to this life. After all, is what happened to him his fault? Aren't his parents supposed to give him at least a better life? When you have a child, don't you agree to offer him a healthy life?The scenes are good but not great. You feel the crowded Lebanon streets with the great camera angles. The \"realistic shaking camera\" tactic is very useful in movies like these. Because you need to feel anxiety, the camera needs to move like your eyes, not knowing where to focus. The music wasn't really still in my ears, so I count this as a fail. Most of the time I always search the movies OST in internet after I finish the movies. But this movie didn't hit me with its music.I always say there is an unnecessary hype with kids acting. If they act avarage people hype them like they acted like a Dicaprio or something like that. I am sorry but acting is a serious job. It affects very heavily how the movie tastes. So we can't classify actors/actresses are kids/adults. I don't really remember a specific acting other then Yordanos Shiferaw. Her mother reactions was realistic. I really surprised when I saw she has no other works. Maybe she is a theater actress, I don't know. Hope best for her future.This movie comes with good -but not great- plot. Leaves you with questions about an important philosophy. Antinatalism. Great cinematography (visual) and good acting. Don't expect a mind blowing movie and you'll have a good time.",

As a film-lover, I found the film a bit derivative of other films by Danny Boyle, especially in its speed and camera work. But as a human being close to this cause, the film angered me beyond belief. It is pornographic and exploitative as everyone is saying. The children are \"cutified\" if that could be a word, primed for a foreign audience. The Ethiopian was portrayed as a \"Magical Negro,\" clearly implanted into the story as a parachute. The parents are one-dimensional and monstrous, which is not the case typically at all.

The drama feature films that Lebanon are putting are outstanding, there is not a bad movie, I'm talking objectively, because everyone have their own opinion on a movie.\nNow when I first saw this movie in 2018, when it was released, I thought it was a good movie but I didn't connect with it. But when I rewatched it 2 days ago, I could not let it out of my mind, and I'm a one who watches 7 or 8 movies a day. So I wrote a conclusion of the film, and more I think about it, more it gets me sad.\nThis film is about a life of a poor yet homeless child, and meets people in his homeless times and try everything to stay alive and survive life, while everything turns bad for him, and when something good happens it only last a moment or two. We see in the beginning how he's saying in his heart that why I've born like this why we are so poor like someone whipping us off in the ground.\nThe message of Capharna\u00fcm is that God don't leave anyone. That there is hope even when we are about to die. Teach us that you need to appreciate your life and gets satisfied with it because see how the homeless lives that they can't even guarantee to survive to another day.\nWhat scary is that could happen to anyone in Lebanon or other countries, that a kid poor or well can become and live like Zayn without even thinking about it, this is why in this hard life you need to work, to get money to live, because you don't know what can happen in life, sure God do everything even letting me write this review but he can do to you things that are very hard and sad to teach you and you will be able to do it on earth before you can join him in heaven.\nThere is more that I want to talk about this wonderful film, that is directed so well by Nadine Labaki who has a great vision to movies, and you can tell by her two previous features. I wish I could talk more about this movie how it reflects the time that Lebanon are passing into, but we need to stay positive and increase the hope and thank God for EVERYTHING.",

Poverty, neglect of education, domestic violence, child labor instead of school and the lack of any official ID are some key words to describe his situation. After having run away from his family, he ends up as a baby sitter of the illegal boy of an Ethiopian cleaning lady. When the latter is arrested, Zain is left behind with the full responsibility for the survival of the infant.The movie shows all this with a straight ruthlessness but the story also has its caring and fun moments, so that it does not ever become unbearable. Moreover, the dense pictures of Beirut street life are really compelling. That none of the passersby reacts, when bedraggled Zain, in his efforts to organize some food, pushes the baby through the streets in a pot placed on a stolen skateboard, may seem strange but only shows that poverty is no longer seen when it is surrounded by poverty.The story covers some other hot topics like human trafficking, Syrian refugees in Lebanon or child marriage. This all comes across very realistic and the inside Lebanese view makes it even more convincing.Then the movie also raises the moral question whether parents should have even more children, when it is already clear that they cannot care for the existing ones. A hard one but at least Zain has found a clear answer to it, which makes him sue his parents for having him born.A bit irritating for my taste was the fact that Zain is way too small and wispy for a 12 year old. Why not let him be 10 and the story would still be the same. On the other hand, the 12 years are only a guess by a doctor when examining Zain's teeth, since Zain himself does not really know his own age ...Despite all, the movie ends with a happy end. Not a fairy tale one, but Zain eventually turns into an official human being simply by being registered in prison. There is thus hope for a change for the better.",

            "review_title": "Review and Summary of Capernaum",
            "content": "In the film Capernaum there was a lot of things that I had learned in international relations such as child marrying, International Development, human trafficking, forced labor, child labor, and refugees. In Lebanon you walk down the streets and see children working, selling gum, and dragging gas canisters miles down the road. The streets are always busy and the parents are nowhere to be found. The children are all exhausted and restless with dirt all around them. They don't get treated nicely and get beat up by any adult. Throughout the film you see a wide variety of different religious beliefs and different hierarchy classes. The story began with Zain and his parents in court. Zain had been a juvenile for stabbing someone and wanted to sue his parents for child neglect and for being born.The story scene then shifts into the past where the story really began, which was at Zain's place to eat, sleep, and take care of his siblings. One of the siblings was chained to a wall crying. It was a very tight space with only a couple rooms. The father and mother smoked a lot of cigarettes in front of their children and would just smoke and sleep all day. The parents feed their children sugar and ice as a meal and have their children work to make money for the family. The parents are dependent on Zain to bring back their needs and to not screw up at work or else they will be living without a roof over them. The mother had numerous children and all were very young. The mother did not care for any of the children especially when she sold her own eleven year old daughter to a grown man to get married. In exchange they were given a couple of chickens. None of the children go to school to get an education as well.Sahar and Zain had a very strong relationship and Zain cared for Sahar very much. When Sahar got her period for the first time Zain gave her his shirt and told her not to tell the parents. The reasoning was because Sahars friend was kicked out of the house after getting her period and Zain did not want anything to happen to Sahar. Sahar had a relationship with an older guy, Assad, who Zain had worked for. Zain tried to make an escape plan with Sahar by saving up a ton of money from his job and getting a lot of food for them but she was already taken to Assad. This part of the film shows child marrying which is very sad because she was not ready to get married. Towards the end of the film Sahar actually passes away from being pregnant meaning she was raped by her so called \"husband.\"Zain is a part of a Syrian refugee family who was very poor. The parents didn't work which caused the family to be in poverty and have starving children. The parents throughout the film did not really care for their children; they would use their children to sell and get more food and or money. In the small space with a numerous number of children in the household. Many of the children were mostly little girls and none of them were in their teenage years yet. They all slept on the same mattress without any blankets or covers. There was one cover that was used to separate the parents from the children. None of the children had papers because they were all refugees. Zain would get slapped and thrown around by his parents and all Zain could do was to just let it all happen.The oldest was a little boy named Zain who was believed to be 12. Zain was asked by the judge what his age was and he told the judge to ask his parents. The reasoning behind this was because Zain did not have any birth certificate or paper work that showed when he was born and how old he actually was. Zain is the main character throughout this film. He worked to keep his family happy and brought food back to his family as well. He also took care of his siblings and watched after them everyday. At work he would lug around gas canisters and deliver food to people miles away. He worked from broad daylight all the way to night. His siblings and he would set up stands on the busy Lebanon streets and sell tomato juice and beetroot juice. Another clip showed the children selling chewing gum. Sahar was getting sexually assaulted by men on the street and Zain had to protect her from the men.One thing that Zain would do illegally was steal food from the corner shop that he worked at. Since his family could not put food out on a plate for all their children. Zain also would go to drug stores and give them fake prescriptions to get different medications. He was told to do this by his parents, showing that they do not care for their children and rather use them to not get in trouble. With the drugs the family comes together to smash the drugs into tiny pieces and use them to wash clothes that are then given to a cousin in jail.Once Zain had run away he met an old man on the bus who called himself Cockroach- man. Zain saw him get off the bus at a carnival and decided to go check it out. He slept at the carnival and ate what he had left. At one point he was on top of a ride and a lady who was cleaning the windows saw him. Zain went where the lady was and she gave him food to eat. Tigest, an Ethiopian immigrant who had a son named Yonas, was eagerly working to keep her and her son alive and avoid getting deported. She knew that when she was caught and deported her son would be taken from her and she would be alone in her country. At work she would keep her son in a bathroom locked up and once she was done working she would put her son in a bag so that no one knew she had a son. Tigest got her fake ID from a man named Aspro. Aspro told Tigest if she didn't have the money she would need to give her son Yonas to him. When Zain was left alone with Yonas he tried his best to take care of him but in the end went to Aspro for help. Tigest was arrested for being an immigrant. In the jail the cells were split up into different religious beliefs and different tribes were locked up together as well. Which also led him to a little girl selling flowers on the street showing child labor. Aspro told Zain he could get him to a different country and had different trips around the world. All Zain needed was a photo showing he was human. Zain then gave Aspro Yonas.In the end Zain is shown going back to his home and asking his parents for his papers not knowing they are refugees. So he did not have any papers. His father then shows a hospital bill and Zain asks who was in the hospital. It was his sister Sahar who passed away from her pregnancy. Zain then grabs a knife and runs down the street of Lebanon to stab Assad. He is then put in juvenile prison and sees Tigest. His mother came to visit him one day to tell him she was pregnant with another baby. She told him she wishes it was a girl because then she could name it Sahar. Zain was furious and told his mom he never wants to see her again. Zain's court case was shown live on television and Zain had a few words to say to parents who couldn't afford to take care of their children. Aspro was shown being arrested for keeping people captive and having them do forced laboring for him. The military found Yonas in a box by himself. In the end Yonas is given back to Tigest before getting deported and Zain gets his picture taken for his ID.",

            "review_title": "Review",
            "content": "Capernaum is a movie about a young boy, named Zain, who lives in a poor city in Lebanon. Throughout the film we see how Zain is emotionally impacted by the poverty and poor conditions he grew up in. Zain, a twelve-year-old boy who is incredibly mature for his age, becomes fed up with the selfish actions of his parents, and ends up making very significant decisions. Three common themes or topics seen throughout Zain's journey include gender, human trafficking, and migration and refugees.The first theme, gender, seems to play a large role in the lives of people and families during the movie. As seen in many places throughout the world, Zain's home city of Beirut views men as the providers for the family, while women stay home and take care of the house and the children. In their culture, it is typically custom for women/girls to marry a man and start a family at a young age. Often times the girls do not have a say in who they marry, as the fathers of the husband and wife make arrangements for the marriage. When Zain noticed a blood stain in his sister Sahar's sheets, he immediately became worried for her because he feared that his parents would sell her into marriage in exchange for goods. His family was poor, and he feared that his parents would be fine with giving her away even at the age of eleven. He took matters into his own hands and got her pads and helped her hide her period. This also relates to the theme of gender because it shows that the older brother was providing for his sister even at such a young age, which ties into gender roles. Another common topic throughout the film that relates to gender is education. It seems as if only boys go to school in their society. In the beginning of the movie, Zain's parents considered sending him to school in order for him to learn, be fed, and receive new clothes. Zain was twelve, while Sahar was eleven. This means that they were around the same age, however, their parents only ever talked about sending Zain to school. It seems as if in their culture, girls and women are not able to receive education, as they are expected to marry a man who can provide for them.Another topic that was seen in the film was human trafficking. This topic first occurred when Zain's sister, Sahar, got her first period. As soon as Zain saw the blood stain in her sheets, he recognized the possibility that she could be sent into marriage against her will. Human trafficking often consists of people selling or giving away children in exchange for goods or services. Unfortunately, many cases of human trafficking are sexually motivated. In this case, Zain and Sahar's parents sold Sahar into marriage in exchange for two chickens, due to the fact that they were poor. In simple terms, they received goods and in exchange they gave away their eleven year old child, knowing that she would be forced into sex in order to have a child. This frustrated Zain, as he ran away from his family when they gave her away. Later in the film, Zain found out that Sahar died during her pregnancy. An eleven year old, forced into a marriage, is clearly not developed enough to go through the steps of pregnancy. This shows how twisted their culture is. Although this is a fictional film, viewers of the movie learn about similar topics that occur in real life. Young girls are often sold into a marriage, even though they are clearly not ready to have a child. Zain recognized the unfairness of this exchange, causing him to leave. When he left, he came across Rahil, the mother of a very young child name Yonas. Throughout Zain's experiences with Rahil and Yonas, human trafficking in introduced yet again. When Rahil gets arrested, Zain has to take care of baby Yonas. He comes across Aspro, a man who is able to provide people with opportunities such as leaving the country. Aspro is determined to buy Yonas, and offers Zain money to own and \"take care of Yonas. Zain, desperately, ends up giving Yonas to Aspro and although the film didn't show how Yonas was treated, it is safe to say that Aspro should not have been able to \"buy\" Yonas. This relates to human trafficking because it shows how a child was sold to a man in exchange for money. Zain eventually returned Yonas to his mother, but in my opinion, no person, especially a baby, should be sold to a another person in exchange for money without the mother's approval. This movie really highlighted the issues that occur in areas of poverty such as Beirut. The topic of human trafficking is a recurring theme throughout the film that shows how much should be changed in these areas.A third and final topic that was prevalent throughout the film is migration and refugees. Many people in the middle east are determined to leave their country in hopes of a better life. The first example of migration is Rahil. She moved to Lebanon and was determined to live there and raise her son. However, she did not live there legally, which is why she got arrested. Another example of migration is Zain. Zain met a girl who said she had hopes of moving to Sweden. This seems to influence Zain a lot. He was determined to get out of Lebanon. He started selling drugs to addicts in hopes of making some money to help him leave the country. The fact that a child at such a young age was determined to leave his country by himself shows how bad the conditions are in this area. Many people leave their countries as a result of poverty, violence, war, or other issues. This film really highlights that fact. It vividly illustrates the struggles people face in the middle east.Overall, I really enjoyed watching this film. I think it was very interesting, but more importantly it educates viewers on the problems that occur in less developed countries. The topics of gender, human trafficking, and migration/refugees are all very prevalent throughout the film. Zain is faced with all three of these and even though he was so young, he managed to take care of himself and others while dealing with the obstacles thrown his way.",

Capernaum has been the recipient of many awards worldwide including, significantly, the Jury Prize at Cannes in 2018. The film's synopsis led me to thinking about the modern concept of childhood in general. Though the conditions which Zain is fighting in Capernaum are exceptional, it is interesting to note how children across the world, at an increasingly early age, are acting more like adults, to the point where an innocent childhood is perhaps bypassed completely. This fact is, questionably, the fault of technology.On planes and trains, there is the increasing sight of tablets and other technical paraphernalia being thrust into the hands of children to keep them quiet, some of whom are so young they can barely hold the things. And, there is s a danger, is there not, in letting children have unfiltered access to a wealth of information online which their brains are surely too young to compute? I was recently in earshot of some preadolescents who were talking with their parents about the recent Extinction Rebellion protests. This precocious intelligence was indeed scary.Having said all this, returning to the cinema, it's not the first time the movies have embraced the idea of children becoming premature adults through circumstance. More than half a century ago, Italian director Vittorio De Sica came to the fore with his Neorealist masterpiece, Bicycle Thieves (1948), in which a little working-class boy called Bruno (Enzo Staiola) helps his father Antonio (Lamberto Maggiorani) to find his bicycle after it's stolen. This, in turn, gave inspiration to French New Wave director, Fran\u00e7ois Truffaut, who a decade later produced his chef d'oeuvre, The 400 Blows (1959), about a young Parisian adolescent, Antoine Doinel (Jean-Pierre L\u00e9aud) who is forced into premature adulthood at the hands of neglectful parents who leave him to fend for himself to the point of making him run away from home completely.Returning to modern filmmaking, this theme runs again in Sean Baker's wonderful pseudo-documentary, The Florida Project (2017), about the precocious 6 year old, Moonee (Brooklynn Prince) who lives with her troubled mother Halley (Bria Vinaite) in a cramped motel room in the shadow of the lucrative mecca that is Disneyworld. While all these films are sad, they are successful precisely because of the precocity of their child stars.",

Baby Yonas whose relationship with Zain was so heartwarming, what a gigantic effort by director Nadine and the crew to establish that trust between those kids and let them lead the difficult story with such sensitivity.\nZain managed to portray all kinds of mature emotions that sadly kids in his condition has to bear. The huge responsibility of caring for and defending his sister while his parent neglected their kids to taking care of a toddler while trying to survive.\nI can't get over some of the scenes that will haunt me and as Nadine said in the intro, I hope this impacts many as it did to me where now I'm looking into organizations that will help children in need and help put a smile on their face.\nFinally I have to give high regards to the performance of the Ethiopian mother character Yordanos Shiferaw. I had to look her up expecting she won many awards in the festivals where this film was shown, I was shocked that there was no recognition to her. She definitely deserves an accolade for a breakthrough performance.\nGo see this movie, then go make a child happy :)",

The movie clearly exhibits that if the pieces of paper that are called \"passport\" or \"ID\" are not \"valuable\" enough (for whatever \"valuable\" means), people are not considered as respectful HUMAN BEINGS anymore.

In other words, raising a child and giving them a chance to become a good person is a tough task requiring a lot of work and sacrifices from parents. Unfortunately, some people take it for granted that everybody should bring children to this world. Moreover, their offspring must even be grateful for whatever life they've been given, however pathetic it might be.The movie tells us a story about such an egoistic couple who've recklessly conceived several children without any actual wish to be responsible for them, let alone take care of them. We see how the children are left to suffering in the slums of Beirut, and it's incredibly tough to watch. Even though it's revealed from the very beginning where the main character ends up, it doesn't make the whole tragedy less painful.On the other hand, isn't it exactly what movies are supposed to prompt in us? The real emotions, the tangible feelings that make us uncomfortable when we watch it all on screens at our cozy homes, maybe even having a delicious meal in front of us. It's important to clash such realities to cook a delicious meal to our minds as well and thus to have a look at ourselves from another perspective. On top of that, it's definitely recommended for parents to watch, especially for prospective ones, so that they could one more time reconsider that imperative decision they're about to take.After all, it can be easy to justify inevitability of the depicted tragedy by societal pressure in such a conservative and religious place as Lebanon. To cap it all, it's not a well-off country either. However, the problem appears universal and is unrelated to family income: even in affluent societies money can't replace parents' love, the unity of a family along with lots of truths and discoveries it exposes, which is all certain to play an important part in a growing human's life.",

In the second viewing this other dimension was where, or how, the emotion was silently accumulating.I suppose most reviewers will see the film as a fumbled attempt at realism. I'm sure other reviewers will use one of these standard words to include that other dimension of the film: magical realism, fantasy, whimsy, etc. And they might feel that this doesn't fit the hard reality of the story.I'd love to see the film again, but I think the brilliance of the director is that she creates a flow of styles of realities, for which we just don't have a word, partly because it's so saturated with so many different unnamable emotions. The movement in the film is a movement of the heart, Nadine Labaki's heart, and in her heart these different \"levels\" or \"types\" of reality are all one. That's not muddy, that's love.",

            "content": "Review: Capernaum (2018)\nCapernaum, 'chaos', follows the dismal struggle of Zain El-Hajj, a 12-year-old Lebanese boy suing his parents for the 'crime' of giving him, and his numerous siblings, life. At its premier at Cannes Film Festival in 2018, the screenplay, directed by Nadine Labaki, received a 15-minute standing ovation for its highly relevant and moving depiction of the increasingly dire situation for the majority living in Lebanon. Since October, nationwide protests have railed against government corruption and economic mismanagement, making Capernaum more relevant than ever, as it succeeds in depicting the resulting injustice of the poverty beckoned by years of growing crisis. According to a 2015 United Nations study, 77 percent of Lebanese residents were deprived in terms of economic status, but what film helps to achieve is the creation of pathos for the emotional and psychological effects of these stats, which increasingly fail to shock and evoke anger in our country, which seems to look more and more inwardly in its concerns and worries, with a certain 'every man for himself' attitude permeating politics and ethics in our post-Brexit era.\nZain, played by Syrian born actor Zain al-Rafeea, escapes his home in the slums of Beirut after his beloved sister is given away for marriage by their parents to a man twice her senior. While wondering the streets, he comes across Rahil, an immigrant hiding her undocumented son while working under a false identity. Zain becomes Yonas' primary carer and friend when Rahel is arrested, unbeknownst to him, and his suffering and desperation for survival is captured in his growing anger and frustration of his helpless situation as the film continues. Zain's character is not entirely separate from the actor's reality, as he grew up in the slums of Beirut himself after escaping the conflict in Syria, and was illiterate at the time of filming, so the integrity of his role is evident in his convincing and natural performance. Now living in Norway, he is a success story of children like Zain, his character in the film, who attempt to flee their conditions of poverty. The plot touches on Zain's desire and attempt to leave Lebanon by boat, an outcome which could have been disastrous had it succeeded, seeing as 3,740 deaths occurred among refugees at sea in 2016 alone. Instead, Zain ends up in prison for what he describes in court at the beginning of the film as 'stabbing a mother****er', whose identity is not revealed until later in the plot, leaving the audience unsure of what fate would have been worse.\nCapernaum is ultimately a film of moral dilemmas, which we as a Western audience are forced to contemplate from a position of privilege, but which we are made sympathetic towards through the struggles of each character. What sits most uncomfortably is the role of the parents in the 'chaos', seeing as they enabled Zain and his siblings' misery through their neglect and irresponsible continuation of having more children than they could cope with. However, viewers will also come to see the injustice of one-sided blaming, as it is the system of government and a lack of help for citizens which also denies the basic desire to love and be loved, something achieved through parenthood. This dilemma stays with viewers for days, and I would recommend Capernaum to anyone feeling downhearted in their current situation, as it certainly puts into perspective our own problems with those of others across the globe.",

            "content": "The film has so many layers of complexity within it because of the many events that lead to its making.\nDuring the mid 70s and into the early 90s, Lebanon was in war with Syria among other neighboring countries. The Syrian army invaded the country and controlled most of Northern Lebanon. Much destruction was caused in Beirut as a result of the constant war. What most people don't know is that Lebanon got bombed over and over by the Syrian army for almost two decades until its liberation from Syria in 2005.\nNow keeping all of that in mind, the female director and mother of two children, Nadine Labaki (who endured this war), made this film with all this in mind.\nLebanon is actually smaller than Los Angeles county. It now harbors more Syrian refugees than the country can contain. Today, there are almost the same amount of Lebanese people as there are Syrian refugees. I was in Lebanon 3 years ago and it was shocking to see refugees living in the abandoned destroyed buildings that their army destroyed in Lebanon; Some are literally living in the skeletons of past destruction. Yet, with all that, the director Nadine Labaki chose a Syrian refugee, Zain, to star in her film. She could have easily chosen a Lebanese boy to play the role of a Lebanese child, but she chose him in particular for a reason.\nIn the end, this film, in my humble opinion, is really a story of peace and forgiveness and a call for the world to care for its children. After all, the children of today, are our future who will direct a new path in our world.\nThe Lebanese community is embracing the children of its once rival neighboring country that destroyed a good part of Lebanon less than two decades ago.\nIf Lebanon is able to forgive and forget to help the children, then any country should be able to the same.\nThe ending of the film was truly captivating. The peaceful smile of a child that just wants to belong, co-exist and live in peace.",

            "content": "When journalists question Labaki about her \"film\", she mentions the great political cause that drove her to make it. She speaks of the misery she witnessed, the poor street children whom she drove by one day, her lucky young actor who was granted a visa to Norway thanks to her impactful film, etc. But she carefully avoids talking about... her film. She'd much rather talk about everything around it, leaving aside any potential ideas regarding her actual cinema. Why? Because she doesn't have a distinct cinematic voice, so she really doesn't have anything interesting to say about her own film. And because, as Godard said, \"cinema is a form that thinks and a thought that forms\", this complete lack of voice is obvious in her film, which is full of gimmicks, superfluous scenes, and an outrageous \"cathartic happy end\" worthy of a propaganda film: a (deplorable) government, a lawyer (shamelessly played by Labaki herself) and the media (known for their unprofessionalism) all contribute to rescue the hero, punish the bad guys and restore order and justice. (I say the Lebanese government is \"deplorable\" because it still practices torture, gender discrimination, racial discrimination, among a variety of other human rights violations). Formally, the film is shot with a Steadicam and the few drone shots are just there to highlight urban poverty. The fast-paced editing doesn't leave the audience time to actually look at faces and find genuine expressions in them. Our eyes are never free to wander around the frame - viewers don't even have time to think, because they're being held hostage by this chaotic and tearjerking mise-en-scene which desperately begs for their empathy but quickly becomes irritating.Labaki invented a new genre: the cinema-mensonge. Canne's Thierry Fr\u00e9maux made her famous, probably for strategic reasons. But that's his problem. Film critics and cinephiles are not blind, and they saw the film for what it is: a calculated exploitation of misery made by an uninspired and narcissistic filmmaker.",

Zain protests when his father tries to sell their sister Sahar to a pervert shopkeeper for some chickens. As Zain's protest fails, he flees from home and meets with a Ethiopian refugee Rahil and her son from where all of their life changes very deeply.\nThis is a story of thousands of families living in many parts of the world.

Caperna\u00fcm (\"Chaos\") tells the story of Zain (Zain al-Rafeea), a Lebanese boy who, while serving a five-year sentence for a violent crime, sues his parents for the \"crime\" of giving him life. A serious hats off to director Nadine Labaki for what is accurately being labeled a \"masterpiece.\"At points I felt that the story-line exceeded what is possible in reality, but that did not take away from the unbelievable creativity employed to weave together so many political and social-economic issues. Walking out of the theater, I noted to a friend that it makes one recall that there is an entire underworld that most people are unaware of, one of poverty, hunger and deep repression. He replied noting that the majority of the world lives there, it's just us unaware. That sums up so much of what this movie is all about and why we all have the uncomfortable duty to educate ourselves beyond social media slogans and quips and address it head on.Caperna\u00fcm has already won 27 awards and has been nominated for 36. It has been nominated for an Oscar, which is a no-brainer once you have watched it.",

            "content": "Capernaum is a difficult film that deals with the complex socio-economic problems of an underdeveloped and poor country such as Lebanon and how such a situation in the country and society affects an average family. It is brutal in its realism and will not leave anyone indifferent. The plot of the film revolves around a main character named Zain who is 12 or 13 years old (neither he knows exactly nor his parents because they have no papers and he is not reported to have been born), young but highly intelligent for his age, who fights against, poverty and destitution given to him at birth. Zain is the oldest child in his family, and the exact number of brothers and sisters is not shown to us in the film, which is what the director wants to show contradictory that in such a society, children are considered numbers. Young Zain cares most about his sister Sahra, who is about 12 years old and who is just entering puberty, but in a society where it is allowed to marry a girl who has just started getting a sexual graduation, he understands what that means. She decides to run away together with Sahra, who is not even aware of what is to come, but her parents have already arranged the marriage, and they have chosen a young man in their twenties who can help them financially. Due to the impossibility of a way to oppose his parents and that marriage, Zain decides to run away from home and then he will find out that the world he knew is even worse. He introduces a migrant woman to a baby from Ethiopia who fled illegally because of the war, whose life gets worse when she is arrested without paperwork, and young Zain decides to sell her to a man who trades people who promise him life in the western country. The baby is guaranteed by a foster family. Zain later finds out that his sister Zahra passed away due to complications related to the pregnancy, and then decides to take revenge. He stabs her sister's husband with a knife after which he is arrested and at the trial, in addition to the trial against him, he leads a counter-trial in which he sues his parents because he was born. At the end of the film, the baby is returned to its mother, the smuggler is arrested and Zain is photographed for the papers when we first time see his smile in the film.No one should lead this kind of life, without any social protection, but people, and unfortunately also children, live this kind of life. The director and director of the casting have just been looking for actors whose lives closely follow the background stories of the characters they play. Zain worked as a delivery man when he was only 10, and his sister in the film is a Syrian refugee who was discovered when she was selling chewing gum on the streets of Beirut. Zain's parents are so poor that they can't afford to pay the bill for his birth, which means that Zain can't get personal documents and therefore can't have a passport, receive medical care or go to school, so he is forced to work as a he would feed himself and his family. In the Middle East, marriage is directly linked to reaching sexual maturity (unlike European culture, where time and partner selection have a high degree of independent decision-making), but it also depends to a large extent on family interests and considerations. What also distinguishes this culture from the European one is the number of children in the family. In Europe, there is a tendency to reduce the number of children in order to achieve a \"demographic transition\", and to reduce mortality, especially child mortality, and then in the next step there is a reduction in birth rates. In Zain's family, children are numbers, they are considered a blessing, but their future is not considered. After Sahra's death, Zain's mother tells him \"when God takes something from you, he blesses you in return\", telling him that she is pregnant again, completely unaware of the world she is bringing her newborn into. She tells him that she hopes to be a daughter (she hopes because she knows that she has more benefits from a female child because she can marry her in 13,14 years and use her for financial gain as was the case with Sahra) to which Zain tells her that she does not have a heart and not wanting to see her, obviously aware of the situation.",

I guess billions of children live a hellish life just because their parents give birth to them even though they do not possess enough resources to raise the children. Consequently a person (child born by unworthy parents) has to live is entire life in hell for no fault of his own. I can relate to this movie because here in India I see such helpless kids each day who live on half filled stomach despite of working at such a small age. Movie is based on Very true and realistic concept. Your heart will ache. That last scene where the child smiles for the photograph might make you cry.",

Perhaps the best representation of this is a framing device where Zain literally takes his parents to court in an attempt to prevent them from having kids, where all the attendees are dumbfounded by the supposedly profound nature of his statements as if Frank Capra was brought on to tack on an ending to this screenplay. The events of the film are tragic, yes, but there isn't much in the way of context or theme to them, everything is just to provide another layer of struggle for our poor protagonist to contend with. Except juvenile prison, weirdly enough. It's sort of glossed over (like a lot in this film that probably should have been explored more), but once there Zain sort of gets taken in by an Artful Dodger-esque crowd without any sort of fanfare. It's Al Rafeea that really saves a lot of this film, delivering actual sincerity where Capernaum could have easily slid into being a very nicely framed arthouse melodrama alone. (2.5/5)",

            "content": "For this assignment I chose to write the film review on the movie we watched in class, Capernaum. This movie talks about the story of a Lebanese young boy who escapes from his careless parents. As the movie develops, it narrates how Zain, the young Lebanese boy, is able to survive on his own. He meets an Ethiopian refugee family, and as the mother gets caught, he took the role of a parent for the baby refugee, Yonas. Throughout the movie, viewers can see the horrible conditions these people live in and how mistreated and abused poor children are. This movie depicts many violations of human rights as it unfolds the conditions families in poverty live in. \n\n\tSince the beginning of the film, viewers can start to notice the inhumane conditions characters in this movie live in. One of the many sisters Zayn has, Sahar, gets her period at the beginning of the movie. When Zayn realizes what will happen to Sahar when their parents notice that she got her period, he does everything in his power to help her hide it as much time as she can. He was trying to help his sister cover this since he knew once their parents notice it, she would be sent off to marry the shop owner that sent her free food once in a while. After his sister is sent off to marry the shop owner, Zayn vanishes to the streets, and this is when he finds the caring Ethiopian woman. He now starts taking care of the baby as his mother goes out to work. When the baby's mother gets sent off to prison, Zayn takes responsibility of taking care of baby Yonas. When Zayn realizes he can no longer take good care of baby Yonas, he gives him away to a human trafficker in exchange of him going off to another country and starting a new life. But for this, he needs his papers or some sort of identification. He decides to go back to his neglect household in order to get the documentation he needs to go off to another country. When he gets to his house, he realizes that his sister Sahar, is no longer alive. He gets carried away by his anger and stabs the shop owner, which gets him sent off to jail. In jail, he reunites with Yonas' mother, which makes her realize that Yonas got handed to the human trafficker. \n\n\tThis film portrays the reality of refugee children, poverty, and violated rights. It creates consciousness about the current refugee problem in Lebanon. There are around half a million refugee children in Lebanon. Currently, there are many organizations looking to solve this problem. They have successfully managed to open schools in order to offer free education for school-aged Syrian refugee children in Lebanon. They are now working on regain these projects since the coronavirus pandemic slowed the pace of their plans. The pandemic has interrupted the refugee children education in Lebanon and has affected the school openings. Humanitarian groups continue to work to provide better life conditions to these children. Even though some have managed to provide them with free education, many of them are still not able to attend classes because their families can not afford transportation. \n\n\tIn conclusion, the movie Capernaum depicts the effects violation of human rights have on refugee children that live in extreme poverty. Portraying these kids lives' challenges makes viewers realize the seriousness of the refugee problem in the world fast it is growing. Even though there are currently many donor organizations that work hard to minimize the refugee current problem, there is still a lot of work that can be done. In my opinion, producing a movie of the inhumane ways many people around the world live in, and how horrifying the effects are on their lives, is a great way to create awareness about the world's refugee crisis",

            "content": "This movie really opened my eyes. While showing very treacherous living and working conditions while following the life of a 12-year-old Zain, it also shows the very real situation happening in Lebanon. When Zain appears in court many times, we see that he is in fact the plaintiff and is wanting to sue his parents. When asked why, he responds \"Because I was born.\" While living with his neglecting parents and many siblings, at times Zain has to choose between being a kid and working long shifts on the streets to support his large family. The actress and director Nadine Labaki says \"How did we get to the point where we deprived a child of the most basic right, to close his eyes and sleep. This movie depicts child and human trafficking, the struggle and fear the undocumented population goes through every day, and the unknown struggle young children are put through in these slums. Zain even takes over the role of a caretaker when Rahil goes missing and he takes care of her daughter until he no longer can. \nThe population of Lebanon, where the story is set, relies on commerce and trade; and Lebanon's foreign policy had been thoroughly influenced by Syria until 2005. In the movie, Zain is approached by a young Syrian girl who is selling boxes on the street. The girl told him about how she and her family received food, which was provided by a \"food bank\" for Syrian refugees. Zain pretends to be Syrian in order to get food and baby formula for him and the baby. Lebanon has many diplomatic relations with countries all over the world. Syrian refugees in Lebanon face many problems, including debt. Lebanon is already in a financial crisis, mainly due to the pandemic and the blast at the Port of Beirut. The poverty rates are rising every year. While the middle class is becoming poor, the poor are becoming extremely poor. The Lebanese government estimates around 1.5 million Syrian refugees as of 2020. Worsening economic and political instability has forced many people out of their countries and towards Lebanon. However, Lebanon is working with important international organizations such as Anera in order to help the refugees find places to live. \nIn one scene, we see Rhail sitting with a queer couple - a transgender woman who sells snacks and a parking attendant who wears a spiderman costume and calls himself \"cockroach man\". The gender rights in Lebanon are not as progressive as they are in the United States, but the LGBTQ community is more free in  Lebanon than they are in other parts of the Arab world. There is a Penal Code that \"prohibits having sexual relations that are \"contradicting the laws of nature\", which is punishable by up to a year in prison\". In 2016, the Court of Appeals of Beirut stated that a transgender man is allowed to change his official identification after undergoing sex reassignment surgery. \nCapernaum does not have a specific theme besides exposing the reality of the lives of these people. We see corruption, racism, and moral dilemmas that Zain goes through, including the adults that are to blame for his poor way of life: his parents.\nThis is a neo-realistic drama and the way it is shot is almost documentary-like. It is very captivating and closely connects you to the characters to make you feel compassion towards them as they are suffering. \nI definitely recommend watching this movie. As I said at the beginning it is very eye opening and made me want to learn more about the current political situation of Lebanon and maybe find out how I can help.",

            "content": "In the movie Capernaum there are a handful of examples of international relation theories.  In general the movie is about a boy named Zain who runs away from his abusive family, who sell their children away. He runs away to another town where he meets Tigest, a refugee from Ethiopia who is illegally living in the country with her illegal son, Yousen. He spends his time with them until Tigest suddenly doesn't come home one day and Zain is left with not many options. Overall in the movie there are many examples of international relation theories being relayed in the movie deal with human rights, human trafficking and issues with refugees and migration.\n\tZain's family raises their children with no documents, and gives them away in exchange for goods and money. The kids are forced to work and give the money to their parents. Zain tries to run away with his sister Sahra, but when he returns to the house she was being sent off to get married to some 30 year old, when she was just 11-years old. Zain fought for her to stay with him but his parents quickly separated the two and sent Sahra off with her future husband. Basically the parents are creating a human trafficking ring with there kids, they raise them until they are a suitable age and the trade them away. They have tons of children over and over and continue the process. They make sure to not have any documents of their children, meaning all their children don't have birth certificates, and are technically all illegally living in the country as well. Also meaning that the certain age of their children is unknown. \n\tAnother example of human trafficking in the movie is when Tigest is trying to gather enough money to pay the man to make her the forged ID. The man making her ID said he would drop all the charges if she just handed over her son to him. Saying that he will be sold to a loving family who can provide even more for him. Obviously, Tigest did not like that option and quickly turned it down without a second thought. But later on when Tigest is placed in jail as she waits to get deported back to her home country Zain is left to take care of Younus, Tigest's son. He is fine with taking care of him for a while, and they manage to make some money to buy stuff for them to live by selling things on the side of the street. After they get kicked out of their home it becomes very hard for Zain to take care of such a young child, and Yousen was starving as well. Zain had to do what was best for him, to give Yousen to the man so he could be placed in a better family, who can provide him with food and other necessities. Zain only did this because it was his last option, he never liked the idea but he had nowhere to go, no money, and wanted to start fresh, somewhere away from his family. Later on Yousen gets reunited with his mother and they get to spend the rest of their days together, but the fact that people have to give up their children in order for money and good to survive is ridiculous. They \n\tIn the movie there are many issues of human rights. Children at the young ages of 12 are forced to work on the streets selling products to people passing by. Children should be attending school and not sent off around town to work for their parents, not only does making them work put them in a dangerous situation but it causes them to \"grow up\" quicker. When I say that I mean they can be children no more, they are being forced to stand by the side of the street all day in order that their parents can buy food for them. They don't get much of a choice, because if they dont they are parents will most likely get rid of them. The government should create laws that prevent child labor, with penantlites against the parents for putting their children in that situation. This would help significantly reduce the number of children working on the streets selling goods. With harsh laws in place, nobody would put themselves at risk for such harsh penalties. \n\tThe movie Capernaum has many examples of refugees and migration issues. The most prominent example would be when Tigest cannot afford to get her ID forged. She was already living in the country illegally but her current fake documents were about to expire. She was trying to save enough money to get it fixed and renewed but the man would not lower the price. The only exception he would make was if she was to give her son up to him so he could sell him. Tigest obviously did not want to do that and didn't even think twice because her son was everything to her. The fact that Tigest had to find someone to forge her documents so that she wouldn't get deported is very frightening to think about. She eventually got caught with her expired fake ID card and was shoved into prison along with all the other refugees that had migrated here. There they wait until they are deported, but from the beginning it shouldn't have been so hard for Tigest to get a real ID from the country. If the country makes it so hard to gain citizenship then the only option left is to forge the ID. If they were to just create an easier process of gaining citizenship then they wouldn't have to be deporting and walking around checking as many IDs as they have to do currently. \n\tOverall, Capernaum has many great examples of human trafficking, human rights and refugees and migrartion. They portray the issues very well and the relation to the international theories are very prominent in the movie. They live in a very poor country and do many things to try to get by. All the issues in the country grow on each other, human right issues leads to human trafficking and issues with refugees and migration. Just by solving one of them the other two would decrease as well.",

            "content": "Capernaum is about a boy named Zain who is only twelve years old. He lived in the slums of Lebanon with his parents and many siblings.  Throughout the film, Zain and numerous people around him face multiple issues. Many human rights violations and problems are seen such as modern slavery, human trafficking, living unregistered, and child labor.\n\tLooking through a liberal perspective of international relations, there have been many issues of human rights violations in this film. During the film, Zains sister Sahar gets her period. This worries Zain and he tells her to hide it so that their parents won't sell her to Asaad who is a convenience store owner. Soon after, Zain enters his home to see chickens in the room and realizes that his parents were trading his eleven-year-old sister Sahar for some chickens. While Sahar was still a child, she was married off to a man because her family could not afford to live. This is human trafficking and modern slavery. Marrying off a child is a clear violation of human rights. People have the right of freedom from slavery. Sahar did not want to marry this man and she was forced to by her parents. This angered Zain and he left on a bus. Looking through a gender lens, woman clearly do not have the same rights and opportunities as men. Sahara was sold off into modern day slavery by being human trafficked.  Through a feminist perspective, this is clear inequality. The boys were not getting married off at a certain age. When Sahara got her period, it raised major concern from Zain because he knew she would be at danger from this. Forced child marriage is extremely unfair and harmful to a child. This ultimately led to Sahara's death because she got pregnant and could not carry a baby at 11 years old.\nWhile on the bus, Zain sees a man dressed up as spider man. This excites him because he was only twelve years old and still a child. The says that he is Spiderman's cousin. I liked that this was included in the film. It showed that Zain is still a kid despite the hardships he was going through. Zain decides to get off at the same stop as the man does and it turns out to be an amusement park. Now being homeless, Zain decides to ask for a job because he needs to support himself. The owner turns him down, but he meets a woman named Rahil. Rahil takes Zain home with him and supports him, and in return Zain watched her baby while she was working. Rahil was a refugee from Syria. She had to leave Ethiopia because she got pregnant out of wedlock. She was afraid that the police would deport her and take away her baby. This is another violation of human rights and gender inequality. From a feminist perspective, Rahil should have the right to have a child without having the fear of being deported. Rahil feared that her baby would be taken into custody when she was born so she had no choice but to leave the country. Pregnancy is a natural occurrence. Woman should not be at fear of losing their child just because they had it out of wedlock. From a liberal perspective, pregnancy should not be punished as this would be a clear violation of human rights as everyone has the right to life and liberty.\nDue to having no papers, Rahil has forged documents to be able to work. When Zain meets her, her documents are about to expire. Rahil goes to a man names Asporo, who had forged her documents the last time to get new ones. Rahil could not afford the new documents. Asporo told her to either pay or give up her child to him and get the documents for free. Rahil then goes to her job to get her money that she worked for, and they did not have it. The manager tells her that he is already risking a lot because she is illegal, so he won't give her the money. From a liberal perspective, this is a violation of human rights. Working for free, or not being given access to the money you have earned when you need it is modern-day slavery. Rahil not getting the money she earned caused her to not be able to get the papers that she needed. Rahil's papers expired and she was arrested by the Lebanese government for being an illegal immigrant, leaving Zain and her child alone. All people have the right to work so punishing Rahil for not having working papers could be a violation of her human rights from a liberal perspective.\nZain and Rahil's son were left without food and water for days. At one point, they were so desperate that they ate ice and sugar. Zain met a young girl named Maysoun working when he went to see Asporo to try and find Rahil. She told Zain that Aspro was sending her to Sweden and that he could do the same for Zain. Aspro tells Zain that he can get him out of the country but that he needs money, or he can give Aspro Rahil's child. Zain then starts selling tramadol on the street in shot form for money. He gets a good amount of money from this and keeps it in the house. When he goes back to the house one day it is locked due to Rahil not paying rent. Zains' money is inside, and he is now not able to get it. This means that Zain had no way out. He had to give Asporo the child. He goes back to Aspros stand and reluctantly gives him the child. At the end of the film, we find out that Rahil's child was locked away in a warehouse with hundreds of other people. These people were likely being human trafficked and sold into modern slavery which clearly is another human rights violation. It was extremely shocking to me that all these people from various backgrounds, some being extremely young like Rahil's child, were all being locked away and sold.\nAfter Zain gives Aspro the child, Aspro tells him that he needs a form of identification. Zain decides to go back to his home and look for his papers. When he goes home, he gets a rude awakening, that he doesn't have any papers, and neither does his entire family. His dad then shows him a hospital bill. His mom tells him that Sahar (his sister who was married off) died. Zain then goes off the rails and stabs Asaad (Sahar's husband). In later court we find out that Sahara was pregnant at eleven years old and bled out on the hospital floor because they wouldn't treat her. All because she didn't have papers.\nClearly, many people in the world are living undocumented with no papers. This causes many problems and leads to human rights violations. People have the right to life, not treating a patient due to them not being registered as a person is a clear violation. People need access to healthcare when they are dying no matter if they have an ID or not. Living without papers also causes another problem. Rahil was unable to work because the was not registered as a person. You need a form of identification to work, and Rahil did not have any. She ended up in jail for having fake, expired documents. She could not get real ones because she did not have any form of ID. It was not Rahil's fault that she was not registered when she was born. This is a clear violation of her right to work.\nThroughout the film there were numerous instances of child labor. This is unacceptable and illegal. Children should not be forced to work because their parents cannot afford for them to live. There were many times where Zain, and other people his age had to work in order to survive. These people are still children and work can cause injury and harm their mental health.\nCapernaum is a great film that talks about various issues that are going on throughout the world. This film has opened my eyes to many issues that I would not have been aware of in the past. I did not know that many people are born unregistered, and about the hardships they face. I also did not know about how common human trafficking still is today and how many children must work on order to help support their families. Capernaum was very shocking and really changed my view on the world, and I highly recommend watching it.",

The queasy themes and fates of the individual characters of this drama will leave no one indifferent. Most of the cast are non-professional actors, which turned out to be a good decision, especially in the case of a Zain Al Rafeea, a Syrian refugee playing the title role.

            "content": "I've watched this movie five times or more. I really liked it. The film focuses on the life of a boy, Zane, who lives in a Beirut slum. Movies are very fascinating and sad.\nIn \"Capernaum\" they did not shoot professional actors, but people from the street in the literal sense \u2013 they were selected there. Shooting on the streets of Lebanon \u2013 \"talking\" nature, poverty, grayness. All this makes what is happening so real and authentic that the film looks like a documentary.\n\nThe main character Zane is a boy from a poor family, without documents, without a childhood, without a future. The theme is not new, familiar to us from\" children of the dungeon \" Korolenko. But here the naturalness, sincerity of the \"actors\" is striking, you don't doubt for a minute that this is how real people live. No theatrics. Everyday dramas and tragedies are told casually, without pathos. And this only reinforces the impression. \nZane, who is about 12 years old, works, takes care of the younger children in the family, does not really eat, does not study. Somehow copes with everything, tries to protect her sister from the arbitrariness of her own parents. But the parents give a 10-year-old girl in marriage, but she will die from an early pregnancy. In Iran and Afghanistan, girls are married at the age of 10. And the worst thing is that most girls die from it. This masculine quality of the defender is also evident when he has to take care of someone else's child, the son of a former prostitute trying to survive in a foreign country. It's amazing that in the most dead-end situation, Zane is essentially a child, looking for a way out, acting, fighting. He is honest and straightforward. He sues his parents for giving birth to him for such a life, considering it irresponsible. Another detail and character trait of the hero: faith in justice. \nDespite the fact that he has seen a lot in his life, he still believes that the court will judge everything and correct mistakes. In the film, you can see a very difficult life of people who live in a country that is fighting without restrictions. We must stop the war so that our children do not cry and live a decent life.\n The film is like a very heavy drama, which is not something that makes you think about life, but rather evokes a sense of compassion for people like us. The plot has its own message, which lies on the surface. The film reveals the problem of poverty, corrupt people, hunger, family, marriage, and so on. \"Capernaum\" tells us about all the worst aspects of the above problems and nothing more. Everyone makes conclusions for themselves personally, there is no specific message, except that the message is that you need to love and appreciate what you have. \nThe film really deserves to be seen, but the film is clearly designed for one time. But you will not regret watching it, because everything was shot very well, despite all the conditions in which this film was created. And the fact of two awards at the Cannes film festival speaks volumes. By the way the film gets a lot of the best comments",

With her latest feature, writer/director Nadine Labaki has crafted a powerful film about impoverished children in Lebanon. It is not easy to recreate the harsh conditions of a poverty-stricken country, but Labaki pulls it off seamlessly. Using haunting cinematography, she draws viewers into the plight of a impoverished child living in Lebanon. From lingering close-ups to stunning establishing shots, the cinematography immerses viewers into the poverty-stricken country. In terms of acting, Labaki draws excellent performances from her relatively newcomer cast. Zain Al Rafeea delivers a dazzling debut performance in the role of a child that sues his parents for neglect. With heartbreaking expressions, he captures the plight of a poor boy that is neglected by his parents. It's one of the most authentic child performances that you'll ever see in a movie. Although \"Capernaum\" is undeniably unforgettable, ultimately it is not a film without flaws. At a little over two hours, it is slightly long and suffers from a lengthy running-time. There are times during the mid-section that it starts to drag and test the viewer's patience. Nevertheless, fans of foreign films will definitely enjoy \"Capernaum\" and so will movie-goers seeking meaningful entertainment. At a time when Arabic Cinema is rarely recognized in Hollywood, it's a timely reminder that the stories of Lebanese children are worth telling on the big-screen.",

I like to know ASAP where a movie takes place, so I had to google it to find out it's Beirut, but Capernaum could've been shot in the slums of many Levantine, North African, or Middle Eastern cities. Unlike most movies that proudly display the landmarks of the city or country therein, we do not get any shots of ancient ruins or the modern skyline, gorgeous churches or mosques, (Beirut is considered the \"Paris of the Middle East\" after all). Instead we get the slums, jails, and the courtroom. Much of the camerawork were close ups and \"shaky cam\" that gave much of the movie a claustrophobic feel to it. Can we talk about Zain (Zain Al Rafeea), the litigious 12 year old who stole the show \u2014 not sure if accurate because he was the protagonist, but my point is that he was phenomenal. He might be the best child actor I've ever seen, I'm not exaggerating here. And I mean \"actor\" as in he appeared in a movie, because Zain Al Rafeea apparently has had 0 training and comes from a Syrian refugee family. Unlike most child actors, who seem to need an adult counterpart to carry the plot, Zain must've been in 95% of the scenes, oftentimes on his own. In a film that is so ugly in so many ways, the beauty comes from the characters themselves \u2014 the smile of a child, the tears streaming down the cheeks of a mother reunited with her infant son. You have to see this one. Turn on the subtitles. This was nicest surprise I've had in a while when picking a movie.",

For me, however, this film never fully worked because the editing felt extremely haphazard, and at times even Labaki's direction, because the movie to me was essentially a bunch of heartbreaking moments (each rather separate of each other) thrown at you one after another to make you cry. Sure, it succeeds very much in the crying aspect.

He looks amazing on camera and delivers one of the absolute best child performances I have ever witnessed. There are many kids here, I believe all of them are real life street kids, and some newer pictures I have seen tells me that many of them have been saved from the horrible surroundings. Zain lives in Hammerfest with his family now. \n\nA remarkable film that is very humane and touching. The story is one thing, the acting completes it.

While Zain, the main character in this film had his fair share of annoying moments, he overall did a good job conveying the story.\n\nThere are several things I would've changed about the film but as a whole I enjoyed it. I truly believe that this is the strongest year for foreign films in a long time!\n\nThe story was interesting, and it was easy to watch. It's not ground breaking and likely most will never know its name (outside of select groups). I particularly enjoyed how caring Zain was in the film, it's hard to pretend the emotions he flooded the screen with.\n\nAs most of you I gave Cold War and Roma less than stellar reviews.

            "content": "I wouldn't call it entertaining per se, but it's certainly provocative \n\nTaking as its subject the horrific plight of guttersnipe children in the slums of Beirut, Capharnaum (the word means \"a place marked by a disorderly accumulation of objects\") is the kind of film of which a superficial reading might suggest miserablism at best, and \"poverty porn\" at worst. The third film from Lebanese writer/actress/director Nadine Labaki, the film is written by Labaki, Michelle Keserwany, and Jihad Hojeily and presents a milieu in which people are discardable, children are bought and sold for a few chickens; 11-year-old girls are married off so their family can pay the rent; babies are fed on ice cubes covered in sugar; refugees roam the streets; mental illness goes untreated; people without a Lebanese identity card don't officially exist. The film works because it never feels like it's exploiting, patronising, or trivialising the poverty it depicts, never attempting to manipulate the audience into feeling a preconceived emotion. On the contrary, it's notable for just how unsentimental it is. However, it's also deeply humanist, with compassion in its DNA and a quiet rage at its core.\n\nTelling the story of Zain El Hajj (Zain Al Rafeea), a young boy from the slums who sues his parents for bringing him into the world, the film then flashes back several months, showing Zain running away from home after failing to prevent his parents selling his beloved 11-year-old sister Sahar (Haita 'Cedra' Izzam). Seeking refuge in a rundown amusement park, he meets Rahil (Yordanos Shiferaw), an Ethiopian refugee working as a cleaner. Taking pity on him, she agrees to let him stay with her in exchange for him looking after her one-year-old son Yonas (an absolutely astounding performance by Boluwatife Treasure Bankole) when she's at work, and the trio quickly form a close bond, until one day, Rahil doesn't return home.\n\nUtilising a documentarian style, cinematographer Christopher Aoun sticks to handheld cameras and, for the most part, natural lighting. The scenes on the streets of Beirut are especially impressive, with Labaki shooting most of the material from roughly Zain's height, or slightly lower. This allows the scenes to adopt his subjective view of the world, without having to resort to less elegant POV shots. Chadi Roukoz's sound design is also superb in these exterior scenes, with the soundtrack crammed with car horns, shouting, crying, laughter, dogs barking, airplanes flying overhead, traffic on the streets. It's an aural overload, conveying just how the massive city is overwhelming Zain, and again, tying us to his subjectivity.\n\nLabaki sets the tone for the film to come in the first shot, as we see Zain, filthy dirty, in only his vest and underwear. It's subsequently driven home multiple times that life is almost worthless here - Sahar is sold for rent money, Rahil is encouraged to sell Yonas in return for forged migrant documents. This is a world in which people think of children as commodities. In such a place, Zain somehow manages to retain his sense of empathy, although he too is infected with the concept that everything is transactional. Nevertheless, in a world where adults are reprehensible, and children their innocent victims, Zain is the story's moral compass, exhibiting a humanity far in excess of any kindness than has ever been shown to him.\n\nIn terms of problems, the framing device of the trial is awkwardly realised, and for the most part, serves only to interrupt the far more compelling story of Zain, Rahil, and Yonas. The scenes in court also come across as more heavily scripted than everything else. Obviously intended as a means to dramatize how Zain wants a voice, it is nonetheless a narrative contrivance that gets in the way of the more accomplished filmmaking seen elsewhere. Surrounded by the more naturalistic realism of the rest of the film, the court scenes stand out because they feel like a didactic plot machination. There is also something of a sense that Labaki overloads the story, pushing just one too many hardships on Zain, and on occasion, the film feels like it's going to collapse under the weight of human suffering and thematic nihilism. This is a shame because some of the best scenes are those involving Zain and Yonas just going about their day, and if Labaki had had the confidence in these quieter moments, she might have scaled back the socio-political content.\n\nNever feeling exploitative, nor glorifying the poverty at its centre, Capharnaum isn't even especially sentimental. The conclusion is disappointingly didactic, and the journey there harrowing and exhausting. However, in the last shot, Labaki dares to offer a very cautious bit of optimism, and ultimately, the takeaway is not despair, but compassion And empathy.",

Capernaum is daring and it screams realism, I can honestly say that this is one of the best films I have ever seen in my life, in other words, this is a work of art.",

            "content": "An old and famous carnival called Jo\u00c3\u00a3osinho Trinta said that \"the people like luxury, those who like misery are intellectual.\" It was one of his most remarkable sentences. It is very easy to sit in the privileged chair of an air-conditioned cinema and all the facilities that a privileged life can give and \"admire\" with the sociologist's air the misery exposed by the Lebanese director Nadine Labaki, and speak with wonders about \"Capharnaum\". It is extremely easy to contemplate the long-suffering Zain saga (Zain Al Rafeea), pose as a bar-table left intellectual, and lecture on social injustices and the need to seek a more egalitarian and less cruel society.\n\n\"Capharnaum\" is a masterpiece with which we rarely see. It is also a film about how we fail as human beings in the most varied aspects. The exploitation of misery, slave labor, violation of the most basic rights, families devastated by poverty and lack of perspective of a better situation, the illegality of immigrant life, arranged marriages in exchange for money, negligent parents with their children. \"Capharnaum\" is a rosary of personal tragedies exhibited in 125 minutes of film.\n\nIt is almost as if the region remained to this day suffering from the denial of Christ. The name of the film refers to the biblical city that was on the north shore of the Sea of Galilee. Nearby was the important Via Maris (road to the sea), which linked Egypt, Syria and Lebanon. In the Bible, Capernaum is one of the places where Jesus performed a series of miracles, such as two exorcisms, the healing of Peter's mother-in-law from a disease, and the healing of a paralytic in the well-known passage of the Bible where Jesus said to the man: \"Get up and walk.\" But, according to history, the people of the city also ended up not repenting of their sins and turned away from Jesus, who had foreseen the destruction of the city. From there, Capernaum, which was a center for tax collection and where there was also a Roman military post declined, becoming uninhabited in the fifth century after Christ.\n\nIf it is possible to draw a parallel between the Biblical Capernaum and Lebanon drawn by Nadine, it is precisely in the moral misery of the human being who exploits one another, even in the lower strata. The human being who does not repent of his sins and continues reproducing the exploratory and vicious behaviors at every moment.\n\nAt the center of the film is the story of the young Zain (lived monstrously by the boy Zain Al Rafeea). The 12-year-old forced to adulthood because of his parents' negligence, was arrested and sentenced to five years in prison for stabbing a man who had married his sister, Sahani. The reason for the crime was the death of the 11-year-old girl shortly after her pregnancy.\n\nOlder of his many brothers, Zain had been forced to mature strength to help support the family. And it is because he already has an almost adult awareness in the body of a child that the youngster decides to sue his parents for the crime of having given them life. Zain considers that his parents were criminally negligent with the whole family and can no longer have children. The evidence was in his dead sister and himself, a teenager arrested and not even formally registered.\n\nThe film alternates scenes of the trial with Zain's journey in the streets of Lebanon. Difficult life, difficulties to eat, lack of hope after losing the sister who had menstruated for the first time recently to a man who just wanted to abuse her...\n\nUntil the escape comes and Zain comes across the Ethiopian immigrant Rahil (Yordanos Shiferaw), who welcomes him. Zain then takes care of his son, Yonas (Boluwatife Treasure Bankole), until the day she just does not come back. Illegal, Rahil is caught by the police, leaving Zain alone taking care of Yonas.\n\nIt is one of the most dramatic moments of the film the period in which Zain sees himself as a father. It's heart-breaking to see him try and try to do the right thing and turn around like giving to feed the child and take care of it. Everything until the moment when it does not have more forces because the life between those who are at the margin simply can not advance.\n\nWe see all this through Zain's eyes. A boy who does not find Hollywood heroes to help him. The closest to it is the old \"Cockroach-Man\", the \"cousin of Spider-Man\", which crosses his path. Zain needs to be the hero himself. So young, the boy feels himself carrying a huge burden of existence when all he wanted was to be a good man. And his speech at the end of the film is absolutely touching at the same time that it is very hard.\n\n\"Capharnaum\" deserved more than a mere Oscar nomination for foreign film. Maybe it's the best of all those who run for the Oscars. At least Cannes recognized its value by giving it three awards last year. Nadine Labaki has made a hard and brilliant film that deserves to be seen by all.",

Throw in an undocumented migrant worker who's also a dedicated mother and I am both surprised and captivated by this structurally intelligent and thoughtful film that fully justifies its 2hrs+ duration. Beautifully shot, Labaki's use of the visual language is sublime, finding beauty and poetry in urban decay and her compositions says so much more than words can. Casting non-actors who have similar experiences as the characters they play, she teases out performances that are raw, natural and hugely emotional, especially Zain Al Rafeea who plays Zain, who utterly mesmerizing with his expressive face and deep haunting eyes. This is a film that excels in its gritty storytelling and does so in a matter-of-fact fashion which brings not just authenticity but an emotional heft that makes this cinematic experience gripping and poignant. Except for one minor concession, the film refuses neat or contrived resolutions in favour of realism and hope in the face of despair. Moving and affecting, with a final scene that will simply break you heart, this is an indictment against human sufffering and a film I simply cannot recommend highly enough.",

            "content": "A SENSE OF URCHIN-CY - My Review of CAPERNAUM (4 Stars)\n\nWe've had so many films about impoverished children, from BICYCLE THIEVES to SALAAM BOMBAY! to SLUMDOG MILLIONAIRE to LION, that it's a genre unto itself.  Call it the Street Urchin Film.  The latest entry, CAPERNAUM, which roughly translates to CHAOS, comes from Lebanese director Nadine Labecki, along with her co-writers Jihad Hojeily and Michelle Keserwany and it follows Zain (Zain Al Rafeea), a 12-year-old child whose struggles as a homeless child on the streets of Beirut leads him to sue his parents for the crime of bringing him into this terrible world.  \n\nLabecki borrows from the Italian neo-realism of Vittorio De Sica yet employs a more active camera and adds a lush score such as that heard in LION.  Although imperfect in its storytelling, this winner of the Cannes Film Festival Jury Prize, packs an emotional wallop, reducing me to loud sobs at times.  \n\nCAPERNAUM uses a trial as a framing device where a singularly focused, self-possessed Zain faces off against his parents (searing, passionate performances from Kawsar Al Haddad and Fadi Yousef), whose neglect and abuse of Zain and their large brood of children proves almost unbearable to witness.  Labecki herself very capably plays Zain's prosecuting attorney.  We know that Zain has stabbed someone, which has led to a prison sentence for the child, but we don't yet know the particulars.  Having children affords the parents many social services they would not have otherwise, but they have no means to care for these children in the first place.  Desperate for money, they resort to such actions sending Zain to various pharmacies to amass opiates, which they grind up and soak into clothing to be sold at a local prison.  They also plan on marrying off their 11-year-old daughter Sahar (an incredible performance by Haita 'Cedra Izzaim) to their landlord's lecherous son.  \n\nIt's this particular event which sends Zain over the edge in a gut punch of a sequence in which he tries to escape with his sister.  The filmmakers carefully set up their special relationship so well that their separation hurts.  Zain retreats to the streets, landing at an amusement park where he meets an undocumented Ethiopian bathroom attendant named Rahil (Yordanos Shiferaw).  Hiding from her employers the fact that she stows her infant son in a stall at work, Rahil sees in Zain an opportunity to have him babysit while she's at work in exchange for room and board.  Naturally, tragedy intervenes, forcing Zain back onto the streets, but this time literally carrying a hungry infant in his little hands.  \n\nNeedless to say, CAPERNAUM takes you to hell on earth, but through it all, Zain maintains a ferocious stance.  He bravely stands up to anyone who would try to harm him or the baby with an intense gaze or a string of expletives.  It's simultaneously remarkable and devastating to witness.  Shiferaw also gives a tremendous performance as an immigrant at the mercy of everyone she encounters.  What happens to her while Zain and her child try to survive on the streets will also break your heart.  \n\nLabecki has great storytelling abilities and a unique directorial style.  Using non-actors whose lives closely resembled those of their characters, she had a script but allowed the actors to deviate from it and send her production off on many tangents.  Shiferaw, an undocumented immigrant herself, was arrested while they were filming.  Labecki shot a huge amount of footage to assemble the story here.  Sometimes it feels like a documentary, but her instincts for shooting action sequences, birds-eye establishing shots or observant shots of Zain pulling the baby along on a skateboard with a pan attached to it, show dexterity way beyond the expected cin\u00e9ma v\u00e9rit\u00e9 style often used in films like this.  I think the framing device detracts a bit from the impact this story could have had if it were to have been told linearly, but it's a minor gripe in a film with so much empathy and respect for its subjects.  A year ago, I would have said something along the lines of, you won't believe what a child has to go through in this film.  Now, however, with children suffering in cages within our borders, it's not such a stretch and CAPERNAUM articulates the chaos with such a timely urgency.  By the time it reaches its fascinating, bittersweet conclusion, you may find yourself conflicted.  Clearly that's Labecki's intention with this angry, despairing, yet oddly optimistic little gem.",

Try to find it.\nZain is a whipsmart, sharp-tongued 12 year old kid, who knows how to survive in the poor neighborhoods of Beirut. His parents taught him some tricks, but they also taught him what awful people are like, so when he's had enough of them, he strikes out on his own, without a plan, just a plastic bag of stuff and his street savvy. \nThe movie is episodic, and there's a framing device involving a lawsuit he files against his parents for creating him, with the help of some do-gooder. As a reviewer, I want to express the deep humanity of this movie, and the whipsaw of emotions it gave me. Zain has a shit life, but his compassion is entirely intact, and runs deeper than most people under any circumstance. For a while, he takes over daycare for the toddler son of an Ethiopian woman named Rahil, who is working in the country illegally. When she isn't able to return one evening, and has no way of contacting Zain, he does everything he can think of to care for the child. They were already living in a corregated shack in deep poverty, so the little that Rahil provided, including breast milk, must be replaced with Zain's cunning. \nThe emotions were overwhelming at times. Firstly, Zain is a hoot, cursing like a longshoreman at all the right people. But he has understandable fury, and when he acts in out on two occasions, there's no question about the rightness of his actions. You can also imagine that a 12 year old taking care of a toddler, literally on the streets, is pretty harrowing, and such a realistic portrayal of young children in peril made me curl up in the seat more than any horror film. Finally, I shamelessly bawled near the end, during a scene of incredible tenderness; the un-looked for kindness of strangers who do nothing more than show up and sing for young incarcerated men.\nThis film won the Grand Jury Prize at Cannes in 2018, meaning that it came in second to Shoplifters, another extraordinary film about people living on the economic edge, but never losing sight of family and kindness, even if their definition of family is more transient than we usually experience. Both are truly wonderful films, but Capernaum will be in my head for days to come.",

It follows a streetwise boy in Beirut who leaves home and survives in the squalor on the streets, even for a period of time with a baby. Ultimately, he's arrested for a crime and goes to court, where he sues his parents for giving him live. In the central role, Zain al Rafeea is incredible: full of spunk and grit. The performance (if you can call it that) from the 1-year-old is also astounding. Actually, all of the actors create powerful characters and director Nadine Labaki has captured their chaotic life of poverty with humanity and off-hand skill (the title translates to \"Chaos\").

She speaks of the misery she witnessed, the poor street children whom she drove by one day, her lucky young actor who was granted a visa to Norway thanks to her impactful film, etc. But she carefully avoids talking about\u2026 her film. She\u2019d much rather talk about everything around it, leaving aside any potential ideas regarding her actual cinema. Why? Because she doesn\u2019t have a distinct cinematic voice, so she really doesn\u2019t have anything interesting to say about her own film. And because, as Godard said, \u201ccinema is a form that thinks and a thought that forms\u201d, this complete lack of voice is obvious in her film, which is full of gimmicks, superfluous scenes, and an outrageous \u201ccathartic happy end\u201d worthy of a propaganda film: a (deplorable) government, a lawyer (shamelessly played by Labaki herself) and the media (known for their unprofessionalism) all contribute to rescue the hero, punish the bad guys and restore order and justice. (I say the Lebanese government is \u201cdeplorable\u201d because it still practices torture, gender discrimination, racial discrimination, among a variety of other human rights violations). Formally, the film is shot with a Steadicam and the few drone shots are just there to highlight urban poverty. The fast-paced editing doesn\u2019t leave the audience time to actually look at faces and find genuine expressions in them. Our eyes are never free to wander around the frame - viewers don\u2019t even have time to think, because they\u2019re being held hostage by this chaotic and tearjerking mise-en-scene which desperately begs for their empathy but quickly becomes irritating.Labaki invented a new genre: the cinema-mensonge. Canne's Thierry Fr\u00e9maux made her famous, probably for strategic reasons. But that\u2019s his problem. Film critics and cinephiles are not blind, and they saw the film for what it is: a calculated exploitation of misery made by an uninspired and narcissistic filmmaker.",

From their descriptions of the countryside, myIn the early chapters of my life, Lebanon was an elusive figure of my imagination. Being born and raised in Toronto, I would hear stories of my homeland from my cousins, uncles and grandmothers. From their descriptions of the countryside, my homeland played in my mind like a fantastic Wild West; the stories always had an underlying sense that the country was a type of Eden, a magical place with magical people, a gem placed perfectly in the midst of chaos.When I made my first trip to the country I was twelve years old. My familial roots trace back to the northern part of the country to a town called Joub Janine in a region known as the Beqaa Valley which is nestled right below the currently devastatingly war-torn Syria. My experiences were life altering; a colossal shift to my consciousness occurred about the world we live in and how that sucker spins, how you can enter a world so electric and alien to your own world with just a 12 hour flight by plane.My first visit due to age was made up of primarily the country\u2019s decadent cuisine and visits to my family.I went back at the age of seventeen with my brother for three weeks, and it was then that my Wild West fantasy began to take true form in reality. Streets cross each other making a labyrinth of life, electric lines lay over and under and all around each other, looming above the streets like a friendly spider\u2019s web. The youth is passionate and wild, full of life and wisdom gathered from their surroundings complete with beautiful flowing hair and beautifully wrapped Hijabs rest on the woman as they socialize, smoking tobacco out of hookah pipes that give off the most fragrant of aromas. This aroma follows you, like the sun that stays on your shoulders with strength, or the full flavored tobacco that wafts through the streets and barber shop. The barber shop that is run by a man who\u2019s lost his tongue in the war yet he still knows just what you want from your hand signals. Lebanese like to use their hands when they talk, they throw them down towards the floor like they are letting go of weights and point as if they were being cut from a Tintin comic strip. Firearms are readily available and commonplace yet no one ever shoots each other, they are carried for their destined use of protection, and perhaps the occasional couple of discharges in the many farm fields of the country. Seatbelts are ignored and so are road signs, if any, yet everyone seems to get along just fine. Some ride in German automobiles while some entire families ride on one motorized scooter, newborns and all.Capernaum, the newest film by Nadine Labaki shows just how exceptionally talented the renowned Lebanese auteur is at capturing that land that holds my heart, and hers as well. Her style is, if comparable, reminiscent of the flavour of Larry Clark\u2019s Kids, with a dash of Paul Greengrass\u2019s Green Zone, and many hints of Vittorio Di Sica\u2019s brilliant Umberto D. The film is poignant; revolving completely around the world of a twelve-year old boy named Zain (Zain Al Rafeea). He lives in a steamy, crammed apartment with his band of siblings, and neglectful mother (Fadi Yousef) and father (Kawsar Al Haddad) in a war-torn neighborhood in Beirut. His parents out of devastating desperation give their daughter to the landlord of their building in hopes of leniency with their payment of rent, an act that naturally enrages Zain, causing him to run away from his family into the abyss of Beirut.In his journey of self-preservation destiny he meets an Ethiopian migrant worker Rahil (Yordanos Shiferaw). Rahil has an infant child of her own name Yonas (Boluwatife Treasure Bankole), who gives such a contribution to the organic documentary inspired style that is truly remarkable. Rahil takes Zain under her care for some time providing some of the most beautifully shot scenes of intimacy in cinema over the past little while. The film\u2019s heart is transcended through Zain and Yonas; their acting is so poetic, watching these two children interact, with the slightest of movements, give elusive kinetic energy that never feels premeditated in the slightest.Drama ultimately knocks on the films door and heartbreak occurs with Zain climatically commits a violent act causing him to stand in court with his parents. He declares hatred for his parents and seeks justice for them giving him life when they have no intention to properly love or care for him, as well as his siblings. This embodies the idea of Capernaum which is according to Libaki \u201cto give a voice to children who otherwise do not have one.\u201dI have watched a select couple of brief scenes from Labaki\u2019s previous films, yet never have I seen one in its entirety and this was quite the film to start me off. The opening sequence is melodious; we see Zain with a number of other children, horse playing through the tangles of flights of stairs and street corners of the neighbourhood.",

The third film from Lebanese writer/actress/director Nadine Labaki, the film is written by Labaki, Michelle Keserwany, and Jihad Hojeily and presents a milieu in which people are discardable, children are bought and sold for a few chickens; 11-year-old girls are married off so their family can pay the rent; babies are fed on ice cubes covered in sugar; refugees roam the streets; mental illness goes untreated; people without a Lebanese identity card don't officially exist. The film works because it never feels like it's exploiting, patronising, or trivialising the poverty it depicts, never attempting to manipulate the audience into feeling a preconceived emotion. On the contrary, it's notable for just how unsentimental it is. However, it's also deeply humanist, with compassion in its DNA and a quiet rage at its core.Telling the story of Zain El Hajj (Zain Al Rafeea), a young boy from the slums who sues his parents for bringing him into the world, the film then flashes back several months, showing Zain running away from home after failing to prevent his parents selling his beloved 11-year-old sister Sahar (Haita 'Cedra' Izzam). Seeking refuge in a rundown amusement park, he meets Rahil (Yordanos Shiferaw), an Ethiopian refugee working as a cleaner. Taking pity on him, she agrees to let him stay with her in exchange for him looking after her one-year-old son Yonas (an absolutely astounding performance by Boluwatife Treasure Bankole) when she's at work, and the trio quickly form a close bond, until one day, Rahil doesn't return home.Utilising a documentarian style, cinematographer Christopher Aoun sticks to handheld cameras and, for the most part, natural lighting. The scenes on the streets of Beirut are especially impressive, with Labaki shooting most of the material from roughly Zain's height, or slightly lower. This allows the scenes to adopt his subjective view of the world, without having to resort to less elegant POV shots. Chadi Roukoz's sound design is also superb in these exterior scenes, with the soundtrack crammed with car horns, shouting, crying, laughter, dogs barking, airplanes flying overhead, traffic on the streets. It's an aural overload, conveying just how the massive city is overwhelming Zain, and again, tying us to his subjectivity.Labaki sets the tone for the film to come in the first shot, as we see Zain, filthy dirty, in only his vest and underwear. It's subsequently driven home multiple times that life is almost worthless here - Sahar is sold for rent money, Rahil is encouraged to sell Yonas in return for forged migrant documents. This is a world in which people think of children as commodities. In such a place, Zain somehow manages to retain his sense of empathy, although he too is infected with the concept that everything is transactional. Nevertheless, in a world where adults are reprehensible, and children their innocent victims, Zain is the story's moral compass, exhibiting a humanity far in excess of any kindness than has ever been shown to him.In terms of problems, the framing device of the trial is awkwardly realised, and for the most part, serves only to interrupt the far more compelling story of Zain, Rahil, and Yonas. The scenes in court also come across as more heavily scripted than everything else. Obviously intended as a means to dramatize how Zain wants a voice, it is nonetheless a narrative contrivance that gets in the way of the more accomplished filmmaking seen elsewhere. Surrounded by the more naturalistic realism of the rest of the film, the court scenes stand out because they feel like a didactic plot machination. There is also something of a sense that Labaki overloads the story, pushing just one too many hardships on Zain, and on occasion, the film feels like it's going to collapse under the weight of human suffering and thematic nihilism. This is a shame because some of the best scenes are those involving Zain and Yonas just going about their day, and if Labaki had had the confidence in these quieter moments, she might have scaled back the socio-political content.Never feeling exploitative, nor glorifying the poverty at its centre, Capharna\u00fcm isn't even especially sentimental. The conclusion is disappointingly didactic, and the journey there harrowing and exhausting. However, in the last shot, Labaki dares to offer a very cautious bit of optimism, and ultimately, the takeaway is not despair, but compassion And empathy.",
