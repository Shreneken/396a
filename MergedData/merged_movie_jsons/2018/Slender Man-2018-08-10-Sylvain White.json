            "content": "This latest version of the Slender Man mythology seems to be universally reviled though I don't entirely understand why. It's not great but it's simply not THAT bad.Alike Lovecraft Slender Man seems to be one of those commonly used subject matters that always seeems to miss the mark. Filmmakers just don't seem to be able to make the most out of the fantastic material presented before them.So yet again we see a tale of a group of young folks on the run from the Slender Man and spooky things happen. Yadayadayada.With a decent young cast including Joey King and Annalise Basso we're presented with the glossiest and most high budget Slender Man movie yet. Sadly along with the budget comes all the usual Hollywood horror flaws, demonstrating once again how badly Hollywood have lost their way when it comes to the entire genre.Sure it looks great, but the plot tail spins out of control by about the halfway mark and that's such a shame as up until then it was showing real potential. Hollywood need to go back to the drawing board, hire indie filmmakers to adapt material otherwise we'll just keep getting this Insidious/Conjuring tripe.Slender Man has it's moments and the concept is pure gold, this however is more squandered potential.The Good:It's Slender Man!AtmosphericGreat castThe Bad:Plot falls apart badlyPotential isn't metToo many common tropes and clichesThings I Learnt From This Movie:Slender Man mythology is fantastic but really inconsistent, no wonder they get it so wrong with adaptationsJoey King and Annalise Basso are going to be big starsSlender Man is like Aliens (Xenomorphs), he needs keeping in the shadows or he looks a bit sillyThis should have been called The Ring: Slender Man",

            "content": "Currently, \"Slender Man\" has the distinction of being on IMDB's infamous Bottom 100 List...the 100 worst rated major release films. While I certainly didn't enjoy the film, it seems odd that this one made the list when there are so many worse modern horror films which somehow avoided the list. I just can't see this as the 50th worst film....let alone 500th.The idea of the film is taken from a pre-existing story of a 'Slender Man' who will kill or make folks crazy who are dumb enough to call upon him. In many ways, the film is a very derivative project--using the existing notions as well as infusing it with ample parts \"The Ring\" as well as the \"Bloody Mary\" story that's been floating around for decades. With \"Bloody Mary\", a person supposedly calls the name out repeatedly until some murderous other worldly thing appears.The story begins with four very dumb high school girls having a sleepover. They find some info on the internet about a Slender Man and despite being warned, they summon the creature...and the rest of the film is about them each disappearing or going mad one after the other.The movie has a scary style to it, with its pulsing music and bass....though after a while it does become annoying instead of scary. The story itself is nothing new...consisting of lots of ideas from other stories, urban legends and films. The acting and direction are fair. My only serious complaint is that I wish it HAD been awful...that would have made it a lot more interesting.",

            "content": "Slender Man is okay. Basic formula you've seen before in these cheap horror movies. It's not scary, nor is it bad enough to be enjoyable in that sense. Surprisingly some of the cinematography looks good and there's some interesting surrealist moments, but the acting is okay at best and the dialogue is sometimes quite cringey. \"Scares\" are mostly just jump scares and a lot of the scenes felt the same. The source material is hard enough to work with so those familiar with Slendy's origins will find this strangely adapted. Slender works more for creepypastas and video games, not so much cinematically. Far from the worst horror movie made, but definitely disappointing, although what would you expect from a Slender Man movie coming out in 2018? Some will hate this movie because of how bland it is, and I could totally understand that, but from a more objective perspective, it's a functional film that lacks spirit. Not really worth seeing.",

Freddy Krueger was scary in the first Nightmare because they didn't focus on the character, but rather the psychological terror. Slenderman tries and fails to build a story around something that only needed to bring a feeling. It tried to get us involved in the lives of shallow and boring cookie-cutter horror-movie fodder characters. The horror genre needs to be left to the artistically gifted and intelligent artists. Slenderman is yet another mass produced generic label product waiting to be forgotten. Watch the trailer, it's way better than the movie. Or better yet, watch The Ritual for a better example of what Slenderman should have looked like.",

Then top that off with having a movie that was downright laughable in script, plot, character-wise and fully devoid of scary moments, and you have the 2018 movie \"Slender Man\" from director Sylvain White.I had to divide this movie into two, I couldn't suffer through the hardships of sitting down and watching it in one prolonged go. It was just that painful to bear witness to. I managed to endure 50 minutes in the first sitting, then had to give up. And I had essentially given up on the movie entirely, but my wife convinced me to watch the rest of it on the next day. So I did... And let's just say that the rest of the movie didn't do anything to lift up the ordeal that was the first 50 minutes.The entire movie was wholly and fully devoid of anything that would be scary to a grown up, which leads me to believe that this movie was intended for the same kind of airheaded audience whom would also believe that the Slender Man legend is actually true.The characters in the movie were unbelievably stupid, one-dimensional and completely devoid of any sense of intelligence and common sense. It was just painful to witness their actions and the way they milled about on the screen. Now, I am not saying that the actresses were subpar or inadequate. No, not at all. I am saying that the characters written for the story could just as easily have been portrayed by cardboard cutouts.Once the movie ended, you didn't even fell that the movie had come full circle. It had just dragged you along by the nose for the entire duration that it ran for, without providing any kind of proper entertainment.Do not succumb to the same mistake that I did when I went to watch this movie. The trailer actually made it look interesting. The actual movie, well let's just say that watching grass grow is far scarier...",

Instead of a clich\u00e9 horror movie, we have a \"nothing\" horror movie.While The Bye Bye man was hilariously bad in all aspects, Slender man is just boring and frustrating. It's a film that was made 5 years too late, containing the absolute bare minimum amount of effort. I do not recommend it.Thanks for another hit Sony!",

            "content": "Sometimes a single line of dialogue can stand out in such a way that you instantly realize that a movie is awful. For 'Slender Man,' that line came from Joey King.\"He's like a computer virus except he gets inside your body and messes with you!\" Oh, so you mean like a virus? Why didn't you just say, \"he's a like a virus.\"Several times throughout the film, that sort of hack writing shows its ugly face (as opposed to Slender Man, who technically can't be ugly because he has no face). There are zero clever lines delivered. Most of dialogue sounds like it was written by a Twitter bot designed to simulate mundane teen talk.The putrid writing isn't limited to the dialogue-the characters themselves contain about as much detail as one could write on a Post-it note. I think of the four main characters as, girl A, girl B, girl with a sister, and token non-white girl. They're essentially indistinguishable from one another. The only difference is that some are slightly more talented performers, and, of course, the most talented girls are the first to disappear from the story.What's really striking about the girls is that, even though they're allegedly best friends, they don't even seem to like each other. At one point, I girl makes a catty, resentful remark about her \"friend's\" trophies. Later, she says, \"I thought you didn't care about track. I thought you cared about Chloe.\" (It's a miracle that I remember her name).That moment is striking for a couple reasons. One, it doesn't seem like something that should be said between good friends, and, two, I hardly realized the girl ran track. Probably because it's never shown in the movie. I imagine the track angle played a larger role in an earlier draft then removed, but this line was left in. Editing isn't the movie's strength.When the girls aren't making odd comments to each other or expressing all the liveliness of a folding chair, they're attempting to appear scared. To show that they're scared, they basically do an impression of a panting dog that's trying to speak. It's a lot of breathing and stammering. Acting is also not this movie's strength.All the above flaws are enough of a turnoff, but the worst offense of this movie is that it's a scary movie that's not scary. It's painfully dull and devoid of anything that may actually make it entertaining. It's as if all the interesting scenes were removed. Why, I'm not sure. Maybe they also cut out the parts that made this appear to be a coherent story.'Slender Man' is one of the worst movies of 2018. It's not a scary movie that's so bad that it's secretly kind of fun. It's just a bad, boring movie. I recommend a hard pass.",

            "content": "Slender Man (2018) 1/2 (out of 4)Four teenage girls are having a sleepover when they decide that it's a good idea to jump online and search out the Slender Man. They come across a website that will call to him so they do it. A week later one of the girls go missing so the other three set out to contact Slender Man in hopes of getting her released.SLENDER MAN got released to some of the worst reviews in recent history and there's no question that it's quite awful but at the same time the film was mildly better than SMILEY. If you've never heard of that horror movie then go check it out. In all honesty, SLENDER MAN deserves all of the horrible reviews that it has gotten because it's pretty darn awful from start to finish. I will say that it avoids a BOMB rating from me because, believe it or not, it does move at a fast pace at least and I'll also say that I didn't expect the outcome of the film.With all of that being said, there's no question that the filmmakers of this really didn't know what they were doing as the story itself is quite dull and even worse is the fact that the story never makes too much sense. The Slender Man is never really explained so it seems they are expecting the viewers to already know the myth. One of the biggest problems with the film is the fact that the Slender Man isn't creepy and the first time we see him it's done so poorly that you have to wonder how this film got released. Even worse is the video that the girls watch to contact him. Jeez, really?The screenplay is pretty darn bad and so are the four lead characters. There's not an interesting one among them and even the supporting players are bad. Not for a second did I care for any of them and I certainly didn't care if the lost girl was ever found. The CGI effects are all pretty bad, the cinematography is poor and the overly dark look of the picture certainly doesn't help things. In all honesty there's not much to recommend here.Is SLENDER MAN the worst horror film ever made? Absolutely not as there are hundreds more out there that are a lot worse. With that said, it's certainly one of the worst horror films to be released by a major studio.",

            "review_title": "More is less",
            "content": "Much like the Blair Witch, Slender Man has always been scarier as an idea within the lore built around it than as a literal and physical presence of it. We laud what the Creepypasta community has done to up the ante with the character originally created by Victor Surge (properly credited at the end of the film as an early billing), and there have been positively freaky spins on the subject matter such as the YouTube project Marble Hornets, yet there have also been negative effects attributed to the character in the attempted murder in Wisconsin by prepubescent female friends. The tormenting figment of our minds is spooky enough to carry throughout 90 minutes of film with flashes here and there. Apparently Sylvain White (director) and David Birke (screenwriter) didn't get the memo.I won't pretend like I could have written or made a better film, but I don't know if the right plot was chosen here. This is a story where SM is already embedded in the national consciousness and skeptical friends decide to attempt to summon him, only to bear the burden of his haunting, kidnapping and/or killing. I personally would have liked to see this have gone in one of three different directions: (1) have a tone more like The Ring where the demonic evil is not known as a figure but simply as a watched video with a curse (they even mention \"virus\" that would be a lot like the Ringu series and get into the anatomy of it), with no alias or concrete image in association to it; (2) let it play out more like a psychological horror, even if it means recapturing elements inspired by the stabbing incident four years ago; (3) found footage fashion, but Marble Hornets already did that, so I'll annex that recommendation immediately. There would be larger opportunities to provide a certain cloud of mystery and intrigue to explore something further, rather than simply to have too tangible of a grasp on the subject matter. Idea #2 might glorify and inspire that notion a little more than we need though, and since idea #1 would tie more closely to the film's actual events I'd say that #1 would be my personal go-to. In fact, when the girls watch the video it actually reminded me of The Ring to begin with, and that was a good thing; too bad they did not continue much down that path.Characters also never really had any kind of realistic dialogue. The opening conversation between two schoolmates just has you thinking: \"This feels like they're reading a script.\" That's never a good thing. Like many horror movies, characters have trouble elaborating what they see and feel with each other, and it comes at an unnerving level here. Only one character ever tries to really cope with what's going on in a verbal manner, but she simply doesn't push enough to bring the others to her side and it feels like a lost cause. I'll admit that she tries, but she doesn't articulate herself well enough and from the outside looking in just comes off as sounding irrational. Well-written horror movies have characters who can actually think and speak rationally, yet still have trouble being able to overcome their villainous adversities.The way it was shot was another concern of mine. This film is dark, and by that I mean it is dimly lit to a fault. I know they probably opted for more natural lighting at times, but even then there are no carefully-constructed shots to contrast silhouetted characters with some sort of lighter background from a light or a dusk evening sky. Even many interiors seem like people forget to pay their electricity bills as they only light up the bare minimum amount. Forget tone, this was just a slighted level of realism that probably could have resolved a lot of the characters' dumb moments if they just turned on a couple of more lights at times. They're also always going out on their lonesome after sunset, which tends to be a recipe for disaster. White chose to let sound play a major role in the film, but often did not establish a shot for us to sense our place in the scene. Everything looked too same-ish to lack the feeling of impact moments take place as they should. I think the choice of shots got better as the film went on, but at that point it was too little too late.There were three scenes in the middle of the film that are almost back-to-back-to-back that probably provide the best overall tension. All three scenes have great buildup, but unfortunately only one executes strongly and the other two flatten out rather quickly. This mostly has to do with the fact that they try too hard to show more, and the effect is lessened as a result. That, or like many horror films it is just poorly edited (sorry to stray off-topic, but speaking of poorly edited... in the beginning of the film there is a \"One week later\" moment that shows up in the bottom right corner of the screen and it fades away the moment it comes on that you might actually miss it). The scene that pulls off its moments well works because of SM really only appearing soft in the background if that, and a lot of mentally-jarring moments for the character that make the sequence feel nightmarish. If more scary moments in the film were like this or if there were less attempts at scaring the audience in general, it would have heightened these moments much more and become extremely effective. Alas, it was not meant to be and we are resorted to cheap thrills. What makes matters worse is that I think some moments would have been great without inserting eerie music alongside them, and I don't want to call them jump-scares because to be honest there aren't too many here (most times they are intentionally telegraphed as they creep into the frame, but the ones that are there could have served better without the score).Before those three scenes that I mentioned (and outside of watching the main video), the story really had trouble grabbing me; past those three scenes (outside of a great 'mentally disturbing images' sequence and one of the visual shots near the end of the film), the story really begins to whimper out. It tries to work in two other characters to an extent and does not deliver on carrying out their arcs throughout (add in one of the main characters as well), parent involvement is set to a bare minimum and they are useless when present (in fact, there's a weird bit where someone thinks they are at the wrong address because they didn't see any cars in the driveway... ever hear of a garage??), there is little to no conveyed emotion for the loss of people near and dear to the main characters to feel their motivation as a great driving force, nobody ever listens to anybody in the film except when it's a detriment to their cause, and for some strange reason the girls all know the passwords to each others' laptops (just a small nitpick on my end). Worst of all, Slender Man was only slightly imposing and just not very scary, and he appears far too often. When I watch the Marble Hornets series on YouTube and he rarely appears in a quick couple of frames, I get the most unsettling chill in my body. When I play Slender and am traveling the forest as the stomps begin happening, the tension ramps up and gets me in the right mood to freak me out when something actually happens, no matter how scary. As a constant, Joey King was the only onscreen redeeming quality of this abhorrent mess.They should have gone with \"less is more,\" and they instead went for the reverse tactic. That did not work for Blair Witch (2016), and it's no surprise that it didn't work here as well. This wasn't even in the \"so bad it's good\" camp unfortunately, and I am someone who will be curious to watch this regardless of any ratings. I do ask that you try and heed my warning when I say there is not much you are going to get from this movie. It wasn't scary, gripping, fun, exciting, or anything like that. Just a morose form of cinematic poppycock that probably came out five years later than it should have, and with the wrong story to boot. I just feel like they missed the mark on what makes Slender Man spooky, or they tried too heavily to rely on his spookiness to tell the story that they did.Oh, and the first trailer ending shots of the girl in the dress is not in the film. I don't even know who that girl is suppose to be, because she is not in the film either heh. Sorry to spoil you there (more of an anti-spoiler).",

Those are the same people who hated Justice League, one of the better movies to come out in recent years.",

            "content": "Despite 'Slender Man' being one of the year's most poorly received films, more than once cited as one of the worst films of 2018, the premise was actually really intriguing and did have potential to work. So this is not coming from someone who wanted 'Slender Man' to fail, far from it. Also have an appreciation for horror and saw it with an open mind, just want to make all of that clear before somebody else tries to invalidate and criticise the opinions of those who disliked it. Seeing it, 'Slender Man' turned out to be that bad, for me it is one of the year's worst along with 'The First Purge' (have seen a lot of 2018 films so this is hardly coming someone hopefully with a sheltered life) and deserving of the panning it's gotten. Not quite worst of SyFy or The Asylum bad, it's not as amateurish, intelligence-insulting or non-trying-ish. It is however difficult to believe that it got a cinema release when it could easily pass for direct to video.The only halfway decent things with 'Slender Man' are the spooky setting and the atmospheric and moody lighting. Both not shining as much as they should have done, thanks to camera work that's at times chaotic and at other times self-indulgent, sloppy editing that made me physically ill and nausea-inducing use of flashing images. The sound is over-bearing and too obvious that it affects the horror.It is also very cheesy and awkward-sounding in the dialogue. The direction is pedestrian and while the cast try gamely their performances are thin and ill-served by having little to work with, clunky script-writing and poorly developed and bland characters doing them in. Worst of all is the story and the atmosphere. On top of not being \"fun\", 'Slender Man' fails badly at its two main objectives, being scary and being interesting. There is no tension, suspense or sense of dread for the horror to work, the reactions are too indifferent, the pacing is deadly dull and there is far too much of an over-reliance on jump scares, all without build up and incredibly predictable.From start to finish, 'Slender Man' feels like a short film over-stretched to lifeless breaking point. As said there are real issues with pacing and that there is far too little in the storytelling to sustain the length. The content is not substantial enough and too much of it is nothing new and sometimes pointless, with the horror elements failing badly the paper thin story and the predictable, disinterested way it's told makes for a real slog of a film.Overall, lifeless, very bland and poorly made. 2/10 Bethany Cox",

            "content": "At the time of writing this 'Slender Man' currently has an IMDb rating of 2.9. For anyone unfamiliar with the site that is incredibly low, for any film of any genre. Does the film deserve a rating that low? Not in my opinion, no. It is far from a perfect film and has many, many flaws, but what exactly has got it that low I can't say. The first thing you'll notice about this film is that it doesn't have the most attractive cast. We are used to horror movies having abnormally beautiful casts with actors and actresses who are perhaps not so great at acting. That really can't be said here and I think it was a good thing for the film. It made the characters feel more real and down to earth (mind you considering the subject matter for the film that goes out the window pretty quickly anyway).The films biggest sufferings come in the form of the writing. For one thing there are far too many dream sequences. I find most horror films have at least one these days unfortunately and that is bad enough. 'Slender Man' has at least half a dozen and they can be seen coming from a mile away. The dialogue is also especially sloppy in certain scenes.The character of 'Slender Man' is suitably creepy and definitely good enough to make a film out of. There are a couple of really good jump-scares, but there are a few appallingly bad ones too, like one where a woman simply walks past a character in a library. This is far from a great film by any stretch of the imagination, but it is also far from being as bad as people seem to be making out. Watch it for yourself and make up your own mind I would suggest.",

For me, this is along the lines of The ring,or vhs, where something awful will happen if you watch something.. it's spooky like candy man, in that you can summon this \"monster\"... and it's visual scares are not unlike those of One missed call, Shutter, Ouija, etc...\nIt has all the elements of a good, saturday night scary movie party... it's not to be over studied.\nit's not to be judged at an oscar level... it's unfair to even complain that it's been done before, due to the fact that the \"hip high school kids are dying\" trope is its own genre. The fx are fun, the jump scares are entertaining, the acting is accurate and well above the average for this genre. it's a fun film, if you like a classic date night saturday fright. it doesn't slow down at any point to become boring, and it's also not constantly shoving the villain down your throat like the last two TX Chainsaw movies did..if you enjoyed films like Urban legend, final destination, and the others mentioned above, there's no reason you wouldn't enjoy Slender Man.",

It features horror alumni Joey King (The Conjuring, Wish Upon) and Annalise Basso (Oculus, Ouiji: Origin of Evil) and introduces Jaz Sinclair and Julia Telles to the genre, the latter turning in a great lead. I never would've guessed that she was 23; makeup and wardrobe did wonders helping her fit into a high school setting, as well as everyone else, for that matter. Joey King's characters have always ridden the fence between strong and annoying, but this was one of her best performances I've seen. Annalise Basso in particular has always been one of my favorite actresses, and here she delivers a more minor yet important role with ease. The story wasted almost no time ratcheting up the oppressive mood, starting as early as the third scene and not letting up for the rest of the movie. Aside from a few unintentionally silly moments, the camera work, audio, and transitional effects were mostly great, with one fantastic scene near the end reminding me strongly of the 1990 Tim Robbins movie Jacob's Ladder. Slender Man isn't the new Blair Witch, but it's likely to stick with you for a good while. Just remember: whenever you hike through the woods, keep your blindfold on.",

It's really badly photographed and lit for the most part - even scenes taking place outdoors in the middle of the day more often than not look murky and dull. A lot of the special effects also don't look that great, this maybe coming from the unfortunate fact that the budget wasn't that big. But what really sinks the movie is its storytelling. The story details are often as murky as the visual look of the movie, with details being vague or simply lacking explanation at all. At times the movie feels like it originally ran a lot longer, but was cut severely down to 93 minutes. But even with that standard running time, the story moves at a glacial pace, leaving the viewer so bored that they won't be able to get much out of the occasional horror sequences.

Naturally, my expectations were extremely low for this film, but my \"affection\" for the Slender Man character (I used to play the games where I would crap my pants quite often) somehow managed to insert some hope into my brain ... Oh, what did I get myself into?!This is the worst movie of the year, so far. Without a shadow of a doubt, Sylvain White horribly directed what is supposed to be a horror flick. 2018 is actually being such a fantastic year for horror films (Hereditary, A Quiet Place, ...), but apparently, I am going to have the genre represented on both Top10 and Bottom10 of the year. So what went wrong?Basically, everything. The only reason why this is not an F is due to the young actresses, who I genuinely think do a job good enough to deserve a bit of credit, especially Joey King as Wren. She goes through some nasty stuff and even if the visual effects are awful (I'll get there), she is able to make them less unbearable. Julia Goldani-Telles is also good as Hallie, but these two are the only ones trying to make this movie work.I don't even know where to begin. I guess I'll start with the (alleged) scary scenes since it is definitely the aspect that annoyed me the most. There is an absurd lack of background lighting, the cinematography is appalling. I can barely see a single scene at night since it is so freaking dark. I can't be scared by a random girl screaming or by an increase in volume if I don't know what the hell is happening.Sylvain does not show anything worthy of technical merit. Besides the shameful cinematography, the editing is incredibly choppy which does not help the running scenes (which are already filled with poorly handled shaky-cam). Every scary scene is a predictable and cliche jump scare, something that not even the lousy horror films of today are doing anymore, to be honest (they are just bad for other reasons). He also uses an excessive amount of close-ups on people's faces and bodies being deformed by some ugly visual effect that left the entire audience laughing out loud. Yes, it is that bad.The score is a mere device to let people know that a jump scare is coming which completely ruins the element of surprise. Thankfully, the tone was consistent, at least they kept the horror vibe during the whole movie, even if they sometimes escaped and introduced some dumb high-school drama. David Birke gives zero characterization to the characters. They are just a bunch of high school girls getting scared and doing stupid stuff. There is barely a backstory or any development throughout the narrative.Birke's screenplay is another major problem. It is a massive exposition festival! If the characters are not searching for something online, they are reading it on a book or watching a video. There is not a single shred of information that comes out clean with a minimum of effort to not be absurdly lazy. The mystery surrounding the Slender Man is evident from the very beginning, and Birke still exposed so many unnecessary details, which dragged the film, ultimately becoming a boring time at the theater.Therefore, the pacing is profoundly affected. With such a short runtime, Slender Man is able to be astonishingly tedious. I yawned every five to ten minutes, while I was laughing at the horrific (not in a good way) scary moments and no, this is not one of those movies which \"is so bad that you love it.\" It is tiresome, scare-less and so annoying that it is impossible to fall into that category.I can't grant any entertainment value to this film. Even if you enjoy this sort of horror flicks, I can't guarantee your money will be well spent. Even if you love cheesy and predictable jump scares, these ones are too weak. Even if you get scared easily, this movie is annoying as hell. I don't think I will ever allow someone to watch this on my watch, and I will never watch this film again. I left the theater perturbated and it was not for the \"right reasons.\"Slender Man is probably the worst movie of the year, so far. Don't watch it, at all. I am sorry to Joey King because she does not deserve to be in such a mediocre film. Horrendous cinematography, choppy editing, the horror heavily relies on silly jump scares and on hilarious close-ups, and the screenplay is a lazy exposition party. Compared to other horror movies of 2018, this one looks like a Disney fairytale. That says it all.",

            "content": "Even if \"Slender Man\" wasn't tasteless in its own existence - coming a few years after a group of young girls stabbed a girl due to a belief that Slender Man was real - it wouldn't change the fact that \"Slender Man\" is an abysmal piece of cinema.The real character of Slender Man is sort of a fascinating take on modern myth, the internet and how stories spread in a modern digital age. It could work in cinema in many ways. Unfortunately someone at Sony thought they needed to ripoff \"The Ring\" but for teen girls rather than do something original.Four stock small town teen girls having a slumber party decide to summon Slender Man via haunted YouTube video because, um, reasons? Honestly I don't know why they did but hey maybe teenage girls in these days love their psychosis causing monstrosities. This Slender Man is some sort of supernatural being that drives people who look at him insane, or just kills/abducts them, or something - honestly his motivations are never explained other than being evil. How everyone seems to know about him is another question I had but, again, bad movie logic. Of course they brush it off as an internet hoax until they start suffering nightmares and the \"get me out of this town\" girl Katie (Annalise Basso) disappears on a school trip to a cemetery. Remaining friends Hallie (Julia Goldani Telles), Wren (Joey King), and Chloe (Jax Sinclair, netting her a Razzie nom) investigate and find out that Katie was into the occult and wanted Slender Man to take her away. Why she needed a group is anyone's guess.So down one friend, what do our somewhat disinterested teenage girls do? Summon Slender Man again in order to get back Katie, of course! You can see where this film is going. Unfortunately rather than play with the idea of a spirit haunting our teenage girls and slowly twisting reality until they break was beyond the scope of the writers so instead they opted for the most mundane path they could find. This isn't so much a slow delve into insanity, but rather a \"make the lights flicker a bit and throw on some kaleidoscope filters\" demonic haunting. The film isn't even 90-minutes long but it feels like an eternity.\"Slender Man\" is a passionless film. Director Sylvain White has a decent eye for filming but if he took this project with any level of enthusiasm it is painfully absent. There is the fleeting interesting segment that is immediately undone by actors who look disinterested in their apparent terror. No one ever seems invested in their paper thin roles, and not even a patented Joey King freakout can evoke a sense of panic. The titular villain himself is barely menacing due to his seemingly random interest in haunting our heroes. Writer David Birke just grabbed an unused \"Rings\" sequel script and copy/pasted some generic teen characters in there after watching \"Blair Witch\", but didn't know how to make anything scary at all.Not helping matters is the unavoidable fact that \"Slender Man\" is borderline unwatchable. No, it's not unwatchable as in being a bad movie, it's unwatchable because the lighting it atrociously bad. Never before have I seen a film so devoted to shadowy style that it shoots its leads in darkness on a sunny day. It's as if thick cloud hovers over our heroes despite the sun beaming on all around them. The night scenes in the woods - and boy are there many of those - are so darkly shot that I honestly had a difficult time telling what was going on. It's annoying because there is clearly a decent eye behind the camera with how some scenes are framed, but it's next to impossible to appreciate given its devotion to darkness.It's also painfully obvious that \"Slender Man\" was released in an incomplete form. Sony Screen Gems apparently feared a backlash due to controversy and had horrid test screenings so they edited it down and rushed it out after failing to sell it to another studio. Characters and plot points just vanish. Death scenes are off-screen or just assumed to have happened. Several of the horror scenes that made it into the trailer never appear in the final film. Hey you know the terribly acted Chloe who we were all begging to see die like in the trailer? Not shown at all - she just vanishes from the movie midway through. I don't think the film would ever be good or enjoyable if the missing scenes were returned, but at least it could have been a passable horror story rather than the forgettable disaster it is.\"Slender Man\" is just a mistake of a movie. It rarely-if-ever attempts to be scary and offers nothing to differentiate itself from the vastly superior films that do similar things. I just don't know how a film as disinterested in its backstory got made. You can quite easily make a movie about Slender Man and have it be unique. Take advantage of its internet-based history and make it a horror story about the original creation of the Slender Man - perhaps its \"creator\" was manipulated by supernatural forces to spread it online.I guess the only positive thing I can say about \"Slender Man\" is it's not quite as bad as \"The Bye Bye Man\" in terms of terrible attempted franchise starters, though it is easily more forgettable. \"Slender Man\" is a film that arguably should not have been made, and definitely one that will be shortly forgotten. This is a bare-bones attempt to squeeze some money out of a decade old internet meme that doesn't take advantage of its origins in any way. Slender Man may drive you insane you if you see him, Slender Man's film may bore you to death instead.",

Summoning slender man was the wrong way to go about it. I thought they would take a more subtle approach. They basically used slender man like the boogeyman in sinister 2. He appeared WAY TOO MUCH. Should of had him more of a shade background character. Not to mention slender man looked horrible. I can't believe they went with the cheesy internet depiction with the suit. The effects look high school grade at best. The only good thing I can say about the movie is that one of the scenes where a main character was making out with a boy from her class at his house tuned out to be the most hilarious scene I've ever seen in my life. I literally died of laughter, cried real tears in the theater at how bad the scene was because she had a slender man hallucination during it and it was just so cringeworthy, silly looking and just flat out terrible. I've never laughed like that in my life. Ending was unsatisfactory and poorly executed. I was going to give it a 2 but the entertainment factor was there because it was so bad that it was good. So I give it a 3 for that. Wait until it hits streaming.",

The three girls decide to make contact with the Slender Man in an attempt to get Katie back in exchange for something else. now in trailer in little teaser witch has footage cut out when i watched trailer it figures me out to think oh this character dies ? alright but in movie it will confuse the crap out of you it's like you watch movie then little teaser. in middle of movie it was boring, slow no point of seeing this in theater, Wren, who has researched Slender Man mythology, warns Hallie and Chloe not to open their eyes while the three are making contact with the Slender Man for fear of death or madness. and stupid thing is they need to bring staff they love to bring it and destroyed it i don't know why ? but that's what it is this stupid Chloe panics, opens her eyes and comes face to face with the Slender Man. Some time later, the Slender Man enters Chloe's house and drives her insane later that you never heard from her ever again not even in scene where Chloe is class stabs her eyeball Chloe gets a Scalpel points it in her Eye, she stab's herself Seeing all Blood Spreading around on another girl i am so CONFUSED right now in movie Slender Man comes to her house and drives her Insane or Possessed her ? witch you can see it in her eyes is black that's Chloe. scene doesn't show Chloe Stabs herself in eye in class ? they said she is been at home sick ?? then where was scene where she stabs herself in eye ? she was never heard again and all movie is like nothing at all it shows Slender Man like second or minute that's it, i thought to myself at end of movie witch ending sucked nothing made any sense at all nothing when i say nothing, nothing just empty ending hasn't explained nothing because footage is been taken away for no reason that's how movie made NO SENSE has director watched this movie before he released it ? has one of writers really read their scripts and plot ? god this is stealing people money stealing just stealing. and also If You Watch Slender Man just like in movie Where Girls Watch It, It Makes You Gets In Your Head Like a Virus This Movie is a Virus made me and made people to watch movie because it looks the way it is the story, scary, darkness, the way how the trailer is made but nope it changes into another way around it.the director is Sylvain White now getting to his history of movies his made never seen any of another's expect i liked 3rd direct to DVD I'll Always Know What You Did Last Summer (Video) witch i thought it was alright but nothing special but his made only best movie was Losers (2010) Jeffrey Dead Morgan, Chris Pine, Zoe Saldana, Idris Elba a better movie Sylvain White should have not made this movie wasted $10-28 million and box office made $23.4 million could have MADE Losers PART II. but no made this crap because Sylvain White wanted to scare everyone made it violent and dark but failed the all thing. people you really need to Watch The Meg (2018) Jason Statham is even 10 out 10 times better then this in august or wait for Mile 22 would way more better make more money then this crap.\npeople watch this in Netflix to save your money waste time but not money maybe one of these scenes in movie will be in Extended Cut or Directors Cut whatever it will be. 1.0 this movie sucked it will steal all your money and you won't see all footage of movie just half of it because it's 1h 33min short because director didn't want to build it for 2 hours long he wanted to make it short because his idiot, movie made nothing sense, didn't explain what happened to missing girl is she alright or ok did they end up finding her at all ? nope nothing explained this movie is just confusing as hell makes to hate movie so badly because nothing any sense. people DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY IN THIS GO AND WATCH THE MEG THAT'S MORE WORTH OF YOUR TIME...",

While it definitely isn't a good film overall, it's about the best portrayal you could expect from an internet horror concept which is essentially a very creepy tall faceless figure that takes children and is seen in old pictures that have been clearly photoshopped. The concept is creepy but really has no complexity or depth. This film at least delivers that same ominously bizarre atmosphere with sparing shots of Slenderman with the simple plotting and overall themes. You cant really expect a plot that goes anywhere with that simple subject matter. The film does drag on in between the creepy scenes with the annoying actresses brooding on in their personal terrors. Another huge problem is that Slenderman shows up maybe a total 2 min of the entire film combined, and the scares are very cliche and standard when he's sparingly featured. There is one sequence in the library that is done properly and has a considerable amount of decent scare ambition. The sound design and effects were firing on all cylinders throughout the film and created some very good sonic tension at times. There was also a considerably solid amount of solid camerawork throughout. Before you know it the film is over and the finale is ok at best but very abrupt. This film is the epitome of middle of the road cliche horror with some decent ambition at times, and is in no way deserving of such an embarrassing low rating.",

And it is getting monotonous seeing people write \"worst movie ever\" repeatedly. So my 10 may be inflated to offset these inexperienced film viewers ( I'd have given this a solid 7, maybe 8).\nBack to my review... First thing that struck me was this movie actually utilized actors that looked and behaved like real teenagers. Unlike many teen based films where they appear in their 30s and act like immature 20 something year olds. While their are so many variations of the Slender Man legend, including the factual murder case that occured in Wisvonsin in 2014, this film did effectively capture a few of those story lines. The use of shadows, visuals just barely seen and the music were also all very effective. The additional hallucenogenic visuals and that of Slender Man himself were also pretty good, sometimes the CGI was a but too obvious. Overall this movie was able to create an atmospheric, supernatural, myth based teen horror without gratuitous violence or nudity often found in movies attempting to attract a teen fan base.",

The story moved along decently with the characters. However, no movie is perfect, and this movie was surely missing or lacking certain traits. For one, the backstories of the characters weren't that explained. Other than the character Katie, who has an alcoholic father as the movie explained, no other character backstories were revealed or told. This might cause viewers to not get as attached or have as many feelings to/for the characters, which is the whole point of the movie. Furthermore, they could have done better with the effects. This is because about half of the special effects were noticeably effects. Don't get me wrong, some of them were good, but some were just only ok. In one scene (SPOILERS AHEAD), the main character Hallie has a dream/illusion that she is pregnant, and tentacles start to poke through her stomach. This scene isn't too well edited and is noticeably CGI. Another scene is where Hallie's friend Wren gets grabbed by tree branches (Slender Man's tentacles) and gets pulled out of a window. The tree branches did not have many textures to it, causing it to blatantly appear as CGI animation. Finally, my last reason for how Sony could've done better, is give Slender Man a backstory. Many people walking in to the auditorium may not know who this demon/entity is. Therefore, because Slender Man was never given a backstory, since he was created in a photoshop contest, Sony should have given one to him so movie viewers could better understand what material they are working with.Don't get me wrong, I thought this movie was pretty great for what it is, but there were some things they could have done better.",

The other thing I enjoyed was from start to finish it had a creepy tone which made it hard to know when the monster was going to appear... the false jump scares I found actually worked for most of the film the only I didn't like with the false jump scares was the library scene where they way overdid it to the point that when monster appeared and did something it wasn't scary they used the scares up with all the jump scares... In my oppinion it's not a bad movie I found the story was interesting I liked the use of the terrain and as a psychological thriller which is what this movie is in my oppinion It does that side of the job well... the creepy music kept me on the edge of my seat..

No. But it's not the \"worst movie ever\" like everyone loves to say about horror flicks nowadays. Go into it ready for some jump scares.. that's literally the game!Now, with that being said, the most notable negatives are character development and the the frequency of Slender Man. When I got out of the theater I couldn't even remember the characters names. The only one I could remember was Wren who was the worst and best character in the film simulatenously. Also, they made slenderman out to be summoned and whatnot, like The Ring, which in my opinion was a lost opportunity. I feel having Slender Man just exist out there in the world and prey on unsuspecting victims would be more intriguing. Because of this lack of origin, it sort of had me going, \"so wait.. where did he even come from then?\"Some of the acting was straight up cringeworthy, and some of the jump scares were completely unnecessary. The beauty of Slender Man is your ability to hear nothing but your footsteps on the leaves. The dead silence is what's terrifying. If any movie needed more silence, it would be this movie. Also, if any movie needed unexpected Slender Man placements, It would be this movie. Everytime he shows up, you know it's coming, and this totally defeats the purpose of this character!! Not knowing when or where he's going to appear is the beauty of the game to begin with!All that to say, I had some fun with it.. there are some notably uncomfortable moments that'll stick with me for a long to come, and open-minded viewers will probably agree to this.

Her father has a rather extreme incident of harassing her friends about where she is.

This is never even mentioned by any of them for almost a full half hour afterward.\nThe amount of fixation with the \"celebrity\" of Slender Man seems to be overwhelming everything else about the film. We are constantly told about how cunning and dangerous Slender Man is, and how he spreads all throughout the internet with his mythos, but we never see anything like this in the film. Anything involving SLender Man's actions in the film are incoherent and have to be explained after the fact in order for us to realize what is even happening, otherwise it all comes across as a completely random ghostly haunting from the ghost of something that might not even be sentient.\nIt's only very close to the end that the movie seems to remember that it had a plot once, and scrambles to catch up.\nAll of the above is enough to crater a movie, but it could've still been a watchable and even fun experience.

Every single horror movie trope/clich\u00e9 you can think of is in Slender Man and manages to execute them worse than a lot of horror films. There is pretty much no story or interesting characters to follow and instead we have a bunch of idiotic girls that are incredibly bland and make decisions that are very stupid. The only time they decide to group together and discuss or explore the Slender Man is at night. Is it not possible to do this inside or at daytime? In one scene a girl says \"Take me\" to Slender Man and as he gets closer she decides to scream and run away which makes no sense. The girls also perform a ritual where they have to close their eyes until they hear three church bell sounds and despite knowing this one of them opens their eyes too early leading to her getting attacked by Slender Man which I don't understand. If you're scared of Slender Man then surely you would follow the instructions of the mythology clearly to make sure you're safe.It seemed the film was solely interested in scaring the audience and it completely fails in that department also. There is a heavy reliance on jumpscares which were handled so poorly and some of the effects used were downright laughable. In one scene, a girl and a guy she loves start to kiss but then she begins to hallucinate where the guy makes a laughably bad demon face. The look of Slender Man itself was terrible. It's like the crew making the film didn't even bother a single bit. It's also strange how the film was made recently when the craze for Slender Man ended years ago.All in all, Slender Man is absolutely atrocious. All the performances were awful, the scares were cheaply executed and the story was SOOOO BORING! At least now I can say I watched Slender Man all the way through as if it were some achievement.",

A small group of friends watch a video that will \"summon Slender Man\", which consequently allows the titular mythological being to haunt them and possibly \"take them to a secret world\". Aside from the dreary cinematography and a decent performance from King, there is nothing to make me recommend this. Nothing! For a creature that's supposed to be well hidden, he seems to be flipping damn everywhere. Does Slender Man ever catch a break? Is this his full time job? Stalking children and taking them? I wonder what we could compare that to...(hint: a well-dressed pedophile)! Sorry not sorry. It's just another case of stupid characters doing insufferably stupid things. \"Don't watch the video\", \"Ok I won't\"...guess what? They watched it. \"Don't take your blindfold off\", \"Ok I won't\"...guess what? They did. The constant prowling in the woods in the middle of the night in total solitude was relentlessly dumb.

For some strange, and unexplored, reason, Mr. Jensen (Kevin Chapman) suspects and attacks Hallie (Julia Goldani Telles) for kidnapping Katie (Annalise Basso).\n4. There are a plethora of idiotic character decisions which are clearly just inserted for forced horror and drama moments.\n5. Most of the jump-scares are obnoxious and they fail to land.\n6. The character and plot development are pretty much nonexistent, which makes it extremely difficult for you to care for any of the characters, or for what's going on.\n7. The editing in the horror scenes is over-the-top and ridiculously stupid.\n8. The CGI looks absolutely awful.\n9. The acting is stale and obviously forced at times.",

The film lacked a lot of sense among the 4 main characters and even some support characters were completely left from the film. It is also a little late to fall on the band wagon for the Slender Man gimmick which was at it's peak around 2013-2014 with a video game that really grew to popularity.There were a lot of cool things they could've done with Slender man. However, it seems like the creativity of this film was lacking immensely as it was extremely predictable beyond all belief. This seems like a film that could've been made by college students but it being made by a studio is quite laughable. The special effects in the film were also laughable too. Especially this one support character named Tom, where his face stretches about and his head quickly jerks about like you may see in any other horror film. I went into this expecting it to be nothing special and that's what I got. If you're interested in a fun and interesting take on Slender Man as a character there is a Youtube series known as Marble Hornets which portrays a much scarier and thrilling experience for free.",

            "content": "Provocative, engaging, and for the most part intelligent- Slender Man may fall short of a full conclusion, but makes up for it in its earlier content and direction. The film has its flaws, there is no doubt about that. The acting from some of the characters, namely Jaz Sinclair (and quite a few supporting actors), are quite obvious and corny. However, that isn't to say the film has terrible acting as a whole. Both Joey King and Julia Goldani Telles give their performances all they can throughout the film, and I would never think for a second they were bad in those roles. I thought they fit the film perfectly, both in acting, and in tone, and I felt they made the right casing choices for what the film needed. Annalise Basso also gives my favorite performance in the film, as short as it is, as her character feels incredibly grounded and focused every time she is on screen. The formula is a bit typical for this type of film, and can seem a bit predictable and/or tedious to watch. However, for the most part, the film is pretty interesting to watch. It's interesting to delve into the minds of these characters and see what the future has hold for them, and it's quite impressive what these actresses have in store for these roles. My biggest problem with the film is the ending, as it seems remarkably abrupt, and almost as if they didn't have time to edit it with any sort of real conclusion. It basically gives you all you need to keep going, but it still feels more like a glimpse of what the ending actually was going to be, than any sort of true conclusion. That all being said, I did enjoy the tone of the film very much, and found it to be incredibly atmospheric and quite nice to look at. The cinematography is very well done, and I surprisingly enjoyed the look ad interpretation of Slender Man throughout the film. In the end, Slender Man is not a great film by any means, but it certainly is an underappreciated gem in the horror world, and I urge those who haven't seen it to go in with an open mind if they ever do decide to watch it.\nMy Rating: 7.5/10",

The movie was in focus, for around 30 seconds the dialogue wasn't bad and there were around 2 seconds of scary imagery.\nNow with a few points, I will mention the things that make it one of the worst horror movies of the 21st century.\n1. The story makes no sense. Scenes just sort of happen and end. This is probably due to the fact that the studio had to cut out a major piece of this movie. This movie isn't The Magnificent Ambersons, a bit of gore wouldn't save it, though I hope the original cut was more cohesive.\n2. No rules. 'It Follows' is a great horror movie, which establishes the rules of our antagonist throughout the movie. Here slender-man does all sorts of things, so you can only sit and observe sloppily put together scenes of things happening.\n3. Jump scares. While they didn't startle me, when I looked around, people were constantly jumping due to the loud sound effects. It would be alright if these jump scares were earned, but putting a loud noise because a character walks by is the laziest garbage.\n4. Boring. It's not bad enough to be 'so bad it's funny'. I only laughed 2 times and chuckled 4. Not enough laughs to spend money, gas and time for the sake of laughing at the weird decisions of the filmmaker.\nI genuinely hope that movies that don't rely on cliches and cheap tricks like Hereditary will pop up every once in a while even if audiences won't give them millions of dollars.",

They watch ... they close their eyes ... and on the 3rd bell tone, they open them again - never to be the same. It was all done on a whim, none of them really knowing what they were doing, or really even caring. It was just something to do when you're bored and watching POV porn together on a laptop. As one of the girls says when watching said porn, \"Some things you just can't un-see.\" I'm sure they all wished they could un-see the Slender Man video.One by one, they are all taken victim to the Slender Man in different ways after various sightings and attempts of appeasing him. Until it comes down to the last of the four girls - who is willing to do whatever it takes to protect her younger sister, now involved despite her attempts to keep her away from it all.The acting was something to be desired. The script and dialogue run-of-the-mill and generic. Basically the same teenage dialogue that is in pretty much every horror film of this caliber. The same story line - discovering weird drawings, online videos, mysterious chat sessions, etc ... nothing new or surprising here. They all even knew each other's laptop passwords too apparently, as they had no problem accessing them.The strength of this movie is in its visuals. The Slender Man \"sightings\" were fun. The cinematography was actually pretty good with excellent camera and CG work. They didn't overdose you on the Slender Man, keeping him a haunting mystery until the movie's final scenes. And even then, it wasn't overdone. The movie's sound was also very well done, keeping an ominous and dark overtone throughout.This wasn't really that bad overall. Not exactly good either though.

            "content": "Directed by Sylvain White (whom I'm in no way familiar with), Slender Man is a 2018 horror film based on the internet meme of the same name. It (supposedly) Stars Joey King, along with Annalise Basso, Julia Goldani Telles, and Jazz Sinclair as a group of four teenage friends. During a school trip, one of them, Katie (Basso) disappears miraculously. This leads the other three friends to try and investigate. But all hell breaks loose, as they soon fall into the same fate, one by one.Ever since it's theatrical release, this film has been railroaded by critics, especially the mass majority. Because of this, I was reluctant to go and see it, specifically with my mom; as instead, we went and saw Christopher Robin, and we both enjoyed it very much. With that said, I (finally) managed to pull it up online, and finally watched it. Is it is bad as it's been made out to be? No, actually, it's not. I'm sorry to say that actually found this movie very unnerving.Many people (mostly on YouTube) act like it fails on every level, which (at least, in my opinion) is in no way the case. It's well shot, has great tension, and the acting (for the most part) isn't half bad; I actually felt bad for these four girls and what was happening to them. And despite having top billing, Joey King isn't the real star of the film; she's not even in it all that much. The true star of the film is Julie G. Telles as Hallie. While not great, she gives quite a decent performance.I'm not entirely sure how this movie could've turned out better, specifically for social media. Many have complained that it came out too late, while others complained that it's PG-13 and not R-rated; yeah, sounds a lot like 20 % of the criticism on Venom. I partially agree with this as there was clearly a scene in the trailer that would've warranted it an R-rating. However, I can assure everyone that no horror movie is required to have an R-rating; implying that it's going to have blood and gore.Lastly, many have said that they found the whole thing unintentionally hilarious. Last time I checked, Ouija 2 (also pg13) had some unintentionally funny bits. Yet, that film had been praised by many.Overall, this is a film that does not deserve all the hate that it's gotten. Maybe if it had a different title, or if the premise didn't involve a \"dated\" creepypasta meme, it would've gotten a better reputation. I can't be sure if it gains said reputation in the future, but it is possible.",

It took me about 10 minutes into the movie to remember that I was actually watching a horror movie and it was only because one of the main characters mentioned Slender Man. After the initial \"introduction sequence\" we hoped the horror would escalate into something truly memorable, and that's what we got.\nIts just not what we hoped for.The characters in the movie are very, very bland. We have Katie, Hallie, Wren, and Chloe, a group of teenage girls who end up summoning Slender Man by watching a video in which they're instructed to close their eyes after hearing the bells toll, which allows him to enter their realm. After Katie goes missing, the friends seem worried about their friend, but eventually they seem very nonchalant about the entire thing and Hallie enters her own world of denial: there is no way Slender Man is real and Katie probably just ran away. There is no true horror in the entire film, even the intended \"jumpscares\" weren't enough to jolt anyone out of their seat. One by one the girls either disappear or their minds get taken over by Slender Man and they become very ill. \nThe only really MEMORABLE part in this entire movie was very unexpected. We find Hallie visiting her crush (Tom) at his house where they start making out on his sofa. His face eventually morphs into Slender Man, leaving Hallie screaming and fighting against him. I HAVE NEVER LAUGHED SO HARD IN MY LIFE!! It was so UNINTENTIONALLY FUNNY!! Our stomachs were hurting so bad and we almost couldn't breathe!! We saw a scene very similar to this in Truth or Dare, but this was far worse than anything we have ever seen. This scene in particular made me add another star to my overall rating.\nSkipping ahead to the ending, we are HUGE fans of movies that leave a rather open ending, but not at all how this movie was done. We find out that Hallie's little sister (Lizzie) went to Wren and wanted to learn how to summon Slender Man, much to Hallie's horror. (This is after Hallie's sister is admitted into the hospital for panic attacks and hallucinations) After viewing the video evidence, we see that Wren is standing outside of her window, about to jump to her demise until Hallie pulls her back in and a tearful Wren tells Hallie that there is no way to stop him; he wants all of the girls and there is nothing they can do to stop him. Wren is eventually taken by Slender Man and Hallie ends up sacrificing herself so he would leave her little sister alone, and the movie ultimately ends. \nIt was a very, very displeasing ending to any movie, ever. We are left with very little closure; what happened AFTER Wren and Hallie disappeared? What ACTUALLY happened to Lizzie after her sister disappeared and how did she recover? It was very hard to see who the main character really was. We were rooting for Wren, but once Hallie was the only one left, we realized that the LEAST likeable character in the entire movie was the protagonist the entire time and it was eventually turned into a story about how Hallie sacrificed herself to protect Lizzie. The plot didn't have any clear direction, as if they just rushed to make this movie and get it out to the public, despite so many flaws and horrible effects to truly make this one of (if not THE) the worst movie of the year. A movie that could have been so promising didn't even stand a chance.",

While you could say it's past its used by date, a good 5 years or so, when this titular being was the talk of the net. And the stigma of a true-to-life attempted murder in the name of the slender man means unwanted negative attention. Still the story could be effective if in the right hands, but 'Slender Man' mostly drops the ball with something rather superficial, and quickly produced with the feeling of wanting to forget and move on.I found it simply mediocre... dreary, yet glossed up horror with plenty of blank stares... well, outside a nervy Joey King performance. There are terrible elements sure (e.g the dialogues and pacing), but i didn't hate myself for seeing it. Some slick atmospheric visuals (in spite of all the dark shadowy cinematography), effective sound design (snapping branches & trees rustling in the wind) and a chopped up feel to the narrative's structure (despite not purposely doing it thanks to studio interference in the editing room) kind of gave off a disorienting dreamscape logic blurring time and space of random scene transitions and incomplete character arcs that \"for me\" kinda worked. It had a \"feel in the blanks'' structure with a lot of foreshadowing. A real mess of sorts and little in the way of Slender Man frights, but those few moments, especially involving King showed promise. It actually had me thinking of Wes Craven's 'My Soul to Take', especially the dreamlike air playing around with the character's gradual loss of reality, and the encroaching fear that sees them caught up in a nightmare of no escape. Once he comes calling, there's no going back.I would be interested in seeing the full uncut version though.

This movie was full of heart and had lots of work put into it to present the audience with the best representation of slender man known to man. Regarding the movie, the beginning starts slow and offers some of the best storytelling I have ever had the privilege of witnessing. After a good intro filled with laughs and a reprenstation of high schoolers that very accurately tells of how I had spent high school it goes into the actual movie and how slenderman slowly inserts himself into the minds of curious kids who think that the supernatural and it's influences are just games. Through a series of intense sequences of dialog and quick scenes of suspense the directors make use of the greatest influence of literary influence also known as pathos to get the viewers to not even want to blink so they won't miss anything. Many people dislike this movie but I believe that is just the mob mentality holding the them from wanting to physically express their love for this masterpiece. I could go on and on about all the things that make this movie a future legend but I am going to stop myself at just saying that this movie is a must see and I strongly reccomend anyone who wants to go to the movies and see something that will keep them on the edge of their seat while delivering easily the best movie that has ever been made.",

            "content": "Apart from a few impressively creepy images on the internet, I was unfamiliar with the idea and concept of 'the Slender Man'. To quote Wikipedia, 'The Slender Man (also known as Slenderman) is a fictional supernatural character that originated as a creepypasta Internet meme created by Something Awful forums user Eric Knudsen (also known as \"Victor Surge\") in 2009. He is depicted as a thin, unnaturally tall humanoid with a featureless head and face and wearing a black suit.' I'm still not sure I'm any the wiser!This then, is the film based around the character. And sadly, despite the efforts of a young cast saddled with irritating dialogue centred around writer David Birke's idea of teen dilemmas (affairs of the heart, usually), this is a fairly half-hearted affair. It owes some of its ideas to the central concept of 'The Ring (1999)' and employs much use of mobile phones to communicate events. The title character looks good, but is really just another 'bogeyman' whose function it is to traumatise flirting adolescents and administer death by CGI. With such a potentially creepy central character, I'm not sure this is the best use of his talents.My favourite character is Wren. Actress Joey Taylor transcends the triteness of some of her dialogue and emerges as not only the most likeable lass of the bunch, but someone you actually do not wish to see fall victim of the machinations of the Slender Man. Director Sylvain White cloaks most scenes in an effective, sinister cold shadow and the ambient score by Ramin Djawadi and Brandon Campbell does its best to sustain the atmosphere. Ultimately however, 'Slender Man' is disappointingly dull.",

            "content": "There was a lot of good work put into this movie. The casting, in my opinion, was awesome. I really felt that these five girls were believably cool and believably New England. I appreciated the move away from typical bland horror movie casting. I also believed that these girls would hang out with each other; again, it was believeable to me that these girls were in the same social circle. I super appeciated that the filmmakers shot in Massachusetts as opposed to LA. LA's great and all, but South Pasadena does not New England make. The location for this film was beautiful and absolutely necessary. These two aspects really worked for me, it is necessary for good horror to pay attention to realistic details - the movie is scarier as a result, and the experience feels authentic.There were some major story problems. I'll explain without spoilers. There was some slight allusion to the actual news story surrounding slender man, but I did think filmmakers could be more daring in this way. Amityville, Psycho, Texas Chainsaw ... there is a long list of films that have loosly based their stories around real events, and I think this film could have come closer to the actual horrific newsstory. There were nods, perhaps, but it seemed too reserved, which made me feel I was watching a movie made by a bunch of 'fraidy cats, which made me feel safe and protected from controversy, which is the opposite of what making a movie about slender man should have been. Also, there was no need to invent the summoning. Again, here, the original story of slender man, and the news stories surrounding it, were far scarier.Also, and I've said this recently about Dark Web, why are horror movies constantly pulling their punches?? Horror movies have gotten so much better in their production values, etc., but they rarely pay off all that suspense, that waiting for something horrific and grisly to happen, with anything horrific and grisly! You don't have to fill the movie with gore or anything, but give me at least one gruesome death that pays off my sitting and waiting for it the entire time, as you do in a horror movie. Not everything has to be Saw or Funny Games, but I mean, if you look around, some horror filmmakers have taken things pretty far, it doesn't make sense not to explore this, even for one scene. And, was something cut from what I saw in the trailor? Tsk, tsk. This alone brought my rating down from 6 to 5 stars. Looked like stuff was cut for a better rating or something, a note from marketing or distribution or whomever is calling the shots now. We need filmmakers, especially if they are going to make horror, to really make horror, and who can stand up to people who keep trying to tone down their films. If you want to see dollar signs, if you want to please the masses, please go make a Marvel movie and stay away from horror. And studio people, this was never going to be a blockbuster, this was always going to be for a niche audience, so make the movie that audience wants to see! Look at what you've done! Look at the ratings here on IMDB! And your audience wants to blame the actors or something, because that's who they see, but no, the acting was terrific, it was, if I could guess, the studio who screwed this up by watering it all down, and the filmmakers who screwed it up by letting them.",

            "review_title": "Slender Man: An Artistic Masterpiece",
            "content": "Slender man is a cinematic timeless neo-classical masterpiece of the horror movie genre. The genre of horror movies has long been notorious for bad films, with cheesy acting, characters and plot lines. Many of these so bad it's good films are b movies with low budgets. Slenderman creates a true and flawless recreation of this genre. The actors playing the main group of girls in this movie performed perfectly, managing to create humor through lines clearly written by writers out of touch with teenage social life while remaining completely serious. The writers of the film alone deserve a huge amount of credit for making the film the masterpiece that it was. The dialogue replicating the type of unintentional humor scenes in movies like the Room while not trying too hard to be humorous as to disrupt the movie. The dialogue between the characters illustrated just how out of touch the writers were with teenagers and high school social life, creating hilarious and absurd scenes such as the scene where the characters exclude Hallie's little sister from hanging out with them despite the fact that she's practically the same age and they really have no social standing in the first place to warrant this. This scene truly encapsulated the cheesy and artificial chemistry we see between teenagers in typically low budget movies, but to see this on such a high budget was great to see.At the base layer of the composition of this film is a nostalgic replication of the classic horror movie plots, that pays homage to the genre of cheesy monster movies. The movie mostly revolves around a girl getting kidnapped and her friends seeking to find her, without consulting adults who are largely absent in the film. Rather than consulting the police or attempting an exorcism, the movie's characters ignore most obvious options and constantly take matters into their own hands which is truly reminiscent of the cheesy horror movie genre in general.Truly a feat of this film is its ability to keep the audience engaged. The downfall of most cheesy horror movies is that they are a slog to get through. However slenderman keeps the viewer interested through it's downright absurdity at failed attempts to create a villain. This is another strong point of the movie. Slenderman is such a classic urban legend, and has become the boogie man of the post 9/11 generation, who have grown up in a culture that creates a fear of strangers among youth. It is this constant worry that something bad will happen that allowed the myth of slenderman to be such a terrifying character in he first place, not to mention his relation to technology and the metaphor of slenderman being manifested in technology. The representation of slenderman in this movie misses the mark completely, creating a monster that is not scary at all and arguably likeable. Slenderman does not have a defined character, and is more of just a guy kills people. That's it. It is almost like the influences he has in terms of nightmares and otherwise are completely separate from his character. This really allows for the actors and plot elements to shine as the star of the show, being the most entertaining things about the movie.I believe that the Slender Man film was originally much more developed, as the trailers vastly differ from the movie itself. The trailers show an entirely different plot that seems less rushed and much more planned out. This is possibly the reason for the scenes changing so abruptly, to the point where the viewer is confused. This is one of the things that makes the film so comedic, because a \"scary\" scene ends up becoming downright hilarious. The trailer also shows the girl who goes missing in the film, Katie, come out of the woods covered in blood, something that downright never made it into the final cut of the movie. I believe that the directors decided that the movie would have a better role as a comedic film. This was a great decision as it sets Slender Man apart from your run of the mill horror film that gives the movie with such a generic modern horror villain a certain spirit that is not commonly found in big budget horror productions. Overall slenderman is a hilarious film that is fun for the whole family. It's poor writing and bad acting clash with its high budget and big Hollywood production style, creating a type of movie rarely seen in the big budget Hollywood scene. It truly is a victory for the genre of comically bad movies, that fits in with its contemporaries like the room. If you want to make your kid not afraid of Slenderman, show them this film.-Rolf",

They had so much potential to be utilized with slender man, but made so many horrible choices with the liberties taken on the Lore. The acting borders from, \"ok\" to \"shamefully bad\", and the script was just horrendous. It's so all over the place, and the potholes grow larger every minute.The film also suffers from trying to stay tame in order to keep the rating safe for kids to be able to attend. It goes so far down the safety hole that it's almost more PG than PG-13. There's no gore, sex, or nudity. The only thing I can think of to maybe justify Pg-13 over PG is that one kid says, \"fuck\" once. (They say \"frick\" other times... seriously) it's just way too timid, and it borders on being flat out boring.The often beautiful shots (when they're not raped by hideously cheap CGI) and fantastic soundtrack are all that kept me from passing out into a boredom induced coma. They repeatedly try for the cliche jump scares, but you see them a mile off. It just fails on so many levels, and it's frustrating because at the root of it all, they really could've made something brilliant if they hadn't succumbed to being lazy, safe, and cliche. I'd say a generous 4 out of 10 and only for the cinematography and score which really are wasted on a turd of a film. The rest is just a sloppy mess.",

But oh my word does this plot fall apart.1: the \"mysterious\" slender man isn't mysterious anymore as he appears on screen every 5 minutes or so.

It's a PG-13 people. It's a rating to include the teenies, so you should know that it will be (generally) less scary/creepy/intense than a higher rating.Secondly, it can be tricky to try and make a full length feature film based on a myth and slender man short horror videos. Sometimes it works (Lights Out for example) and other times it doesn't. For me, Slender Man is right there on the fence between working and not working. It's a decent attempt in my opinion and while it does tend to drag at times, it didn't really get too boring for me, especially not as far as for me to turn it off. Dunno about this whole \"too dark\" thing either as I managed to see everything with no problems.The tension, scares and overall creep factor is pretty minimal in honesty, but they generally weren't TOO bad. I think if the film makers kept the full on detail views of Slender Man to a minimum it might have been a bit more creepy. The glimpses of him and clever 'blending in' tricks employed could have made for a bit more of a creepy atmosphere. The parts where this happened had more intensity for me rather than the full on 'up close & personal' shots although some of those shots were pretty decent enough. Javier Botet was pretty good as Slender Man and while it wasn't his creepiest role (Insidious holds that title I think as the Red Faced Demon) he still does a convincing portrayal as Slender Man.Like I said, this isn't a great movie but if you're struggling for something to watch then you could definitely do much worse than this.",

            "content": "I'd heard that this scary movie received many negative reviews, and I became interested to see why, so I watched it after it was broadcast on TV, directed by Sylvain White (I'll Always Know What You Last Summer, The Losers). Basically, in a small town in Massachusetts, high school friends Hallie Knudsen (Julia Goldani Telles), Wren (Joey King), Chloe (Razzie nominated Jaz Sinclair), and Katie (Annalise Basso) are fascinated by the internet phenomenon of the Slender Man (Javier Botet). Many online images which apparently contain a thin, unnaturally tall humanoid with a featureless head and face, wearing a black suit. They four friends find a video online to see how one can summon this mysterious monster. The girls close their eyes as they wait to hear the tolling of bells. A week later, the girls are on a class field trip at a cemetery, Katie is spooked by something in the trees, and disappears without trace. The three girls find out Katie had been involved in the occult and wanted the Slender Man to take her. In an attempt to bring Katie back, the three friends decide to make contact with the Slender Man in exchange for something else. Wren has researched the mythology of the Slender Man, including victims that have apparently been taken, and those that the monster has left behind. She warns Hallie and Chloe not to open their eyes when trying to make contact with the monster for fear of death or madness. Chloe panics, opens her eyes, and comes face to face with the Slender Man. Sometime later, the monster enters Chloe's house and drives her insane. Wren suffers from frightening visions. She searches for a solution while Hallie unsuccessfully tries to move on. Soon, Hallie's younger sister Lizzie (Taylor Richardson) suffers a major panic attack and is taken to hospital and sedated. Hallie finds out that Lizzie has tried to help Wren in an attempt to contact the Slender Man again. Hallie confronts Wren about Lizzie. Wren tells Hallie that the Slender Man only wants them before she is taken by the monster herself. Hallie, realising that the only way to save Lizzie is to give herself to the Slender Man, sacrifices herself for her sister. Lizzie recovers and reflects on the situation that resulted in the death of her sister and her friends. Also starring Alex Fitzalan as Tom, Jessica Blank as Hallie's Mother, Michael Reilly Burke as Hallie's Dad, Kevin Chapman as Mr. Jensen, and Miguel Nascimento as Kyle. King and her co-stars try to keep you interested with their petrified screams and cries of fear, and there are some gross-out eye-catching images during nightmare sequences and obviously the title monster appearing. The problem is it is let down by many repetitive moments, predictable bogeyman style material we've seen so many times before, terrible attempts at jump scares, it is just a flimsy and boring slog, a near pointless supernatural horror. Adequate!",

For me, There really isn't alot alot to complain about and it really brings a lot of suspense, horror, and thriller, and mystery which actually makes it more entertaining. Although it could have used a little more of Slenderman's wrath, It really describes his character which leads to a genius ending and a very good lesson. I recommend it to Creepypasta fans and people who are really into a lot of this genre. I personally enjoyed it. The suspense is my favorite part about this film.",

The characters are bland as hell, without any real character traits that will make me connect with them in any way.The story is very slow paced and kind of a drag, a lot of scenes in the trailer were cut out of the movie to make it marketable to teenagers, who probably ended up hating it anyway.The scares are pretty awful, the majority of them are jumpscares (aka just a loud sound being added to scare the audience a bit) and the ones that aren't are hilarious, I found myself laughing at every ridiculous attempt to try and scare the audience.Overall, pretty bad, 4/10",

The sound effects were visceral, and the 'in your face' (literally) camera style made it easy to connect with the actor's perceptions. We were taken on a gripping systematic journey with the teens as their carefree life descended into a hellish nightmare in the demonic hands of Slender man. As a modern metaphor, he is compared to a computer virus that infiltrates his victim's mind. I felt that the young actors did a great job. There were a few good jump scares (for those who need that!) and a sustained sense of terror. The dream-like scenes involving slender man were scary enough. He is such an impressive villain in that any interaction with him ultimately proves fatal. Like all good horror movies, good guys don't win!This movie has been heavily criticised, but it's always good to approach movies with an open mind and look for the positives.",

Here's why:The film makes use of a small cast mainly consisting out of teenage characters. Here's why 70% of the movie consists out of high school- peer pressure, teenage romance, girls bitchfighting and family problems. Fun for some people maybe but for a horror maybe not so suitable. \nSo its all about the small teen cast consisting out of 4 girls who are played by women I didn't even knew before. None of the acting is really worth mentioning but the actress playing the girl Wren does a decent job in my opinion.Then on to the horror part of the movie. It's all about our man Slenderman ofcourse. The ones who've played the game will know how he looks like and I can tell you: he looks exactly the same. Even the quality is the same. Its actually a very bad quality CGI/effect that runs through this movie. A highschooler could've done the same job. After the movie i noticed an actor was hired to play slenderman but this seems rather useless due to what's mentioned above. The jumpscares in the movie are rather cheap, nothing you haven't seen before. Even sometimes a bit funny due to the crappiness of the effects. Storyline has some big holes and character development is a mess, you're left with a lot of questions afterwards.I'll suggest everyone who's not a fan of Slenderman but just curious about him to play one of the games that are released about this character, you'll get the same as the movie but even better.",

            "content": "Okay, I guess its time to talk about urban legends on the Internet. Though I have my fair share of videos and channels I'll watch on YouTube, I'm not one to read fully into local stories about people claiming they saw things like clowns and monsters in the woods. Probably one that took the web by storm was Slender Man. I know the suit wearing, faceless thing has a backstory on websites, but the furthest knowledge I have comes from a video game that I played a while back. While I wasn't scared of this like a lot of survival games, it did give a spooky atmosphere and a lot of people did play it. And yes, I do know about the tragic stabbing that happened by two teenage girls who believed in Slender Man and wanted to impress him.Now while he was big, that was almost four or five years ago. Like a lot of video games, anything revolving around the internet tends to have s short popularity window. This is why we have gotten very few movies based off of Internet memes. On the one hand, it's hard to see why a Slender Man movie got made, but I do see the potential. In the New England area, we have four teenage friends; Wren (played by Joey king), Hallie (played by Julia Goldani Telles), Chloe (played by Jaz Sinclair) and Katie (played by Annalise Basso). They act like how a lot of high-schoolers, just trying to get through class, hoping to get the popular guy and trying to have fun. When they hear a group of boys admitting they were going to try and summon the \"Slender Man\", the girls decide to do the same. They go to a webpage and watch a hypnotic video that seems to invoke something. A few days later on a class trip, Katie goes missing and both Wren and Hallie figure it has to do with Slender Man. They spend a good chunk of the movie attempting to look into it's history and how it might be responsible for a lot of other missing children. The further they dive into the mystery, the more their lives start to become affected by occasional dreams and sights of the Slender Man. More people go mossing and they see more abstract images even if their the only ones that can see them. Can they figure out where their friends are?Where do I begin with Slender Man? I can start by saying that the concept of watching a forbidden video has already been done with in The Ring. The idea of doing it on the Web isn't a bad idea, but I can a hundred percent guarantee that nothing new is added here. For a movie that took four years to make, it steals from other horror movies like The Ring, I Know What You Did Last Summer, The Grudge, and The Craft. The cinematography is even shot like one of those films from the late 1990's. The worst thing about it is The Slender Man is dull and boring. The characters have no personality, there's little narrative plot, no focus, and it keeps witching points of narrative at complete random. It might focus on Joey King as a main character, before switching to another girl while throwing her out. It's like the movie couldn't decide if the movie should be a group story or something more personal. The Slender Man feel like random notes from a horror film fanatic who went insane. I swear, this was a tough movie to get through. I can't imagine even the most hardcore fans of Slender Man even liking this.I'll give this two slender men out of ten. It's a bad sign when I went to see this with a bunch of teenagers who were silent for the majority with no laughs, no screams, or even that much interest. This is one legend that will not last.",

Somehow I was positive, I like the subject and I thought that after all the Marble Hornets and whatever else was there - a proper cinematic take with solid budget would produce a decent result.Well... Is that the curse of video game movies? I suppose that's the closest explanation. They can't for the life of them stick to the core material. None of them. Of course, it might not have been better to have one and a half hour of white noise and weeping angels, but then again they could've taken some notes from Marble Hornets. Mixing that and the core game material, adding some coherence, pacing and relevant plot...Instead they just went for the lowest common denominator. Four teenage girls do something predictably stupid in an attempt to show that girls are apparently no different from boys when it comes to being stupid. Well, goal achieved. Then somebody goes missing and the rest start to dig around for exposition. Which, of course, provokes numerous repetitive, predictable and, frankly, yawn-boring Paranormal Activity moments, all of which include and suggest that Slender Man is impervious to anything, doesn't have any particular moral center and that the girls are just screwed. That much becomes apparent almost one third into the movie. Yet they will still do this and that, one stupid thing here, another there, an ear-cringe fest at the house or the library... At least \"It\" was artistic, this thing is just basic demon hallucination with lots of... well, not even noise. Because I wouldn't mind white noise, but they had to make Slender Man into a Leshy, or, rather, Spirit of the Woods from Witcher - and that felt absolutely out of place. Sure, we've seen sight-based monsters before, though not on the big screen, so maybe literally replicating the game wouldn't be smart, but Slender Man is a psychological horror. It's the embodiment of paranoia, of being watched, followed. It's like a proper \"It Follows\", which is also quite a terrible movie, but still far better represents the subject.The problem of this movie is that if you changed the CGI\\the dummy from Slender Man to ANYTHING else - the movie would barely change. Babadook, It, It Follows, Paranormal Activity, Insidious - you change the monster for any of these and the movie could very well go exactly the same. You don't have to change a single line of the plot. Maybe if this was a 90-ies movie - it could resound better, but nowadays you just feel that you've \"seen\" that before. And what you hoped to see - isn't there.I always like when characters try to take themselves seriously, or fight back. Clear Rivers in Final Destination 2 locking herself in the asylum, for example. It means that the writers want to explore, to tackle the subject, to toy with the viewer. Of course, when it becomes a monster slasher, like \"It\" - it kind of loses the mark, but if they have so much exposition, if they have introduced even the characters' friends, who, somehow, are involved - then why not work with it. Or, at least, make the conclusion properly tragic and realistic, like in Krampus.But no, no no no. Again, they went with all the easiest solutions. It's almost like they were forced to write\\make this movie, and, obviously, people have to work. The question is - why is it always wrong people working in the wrong places... The only reason I give this thing 2 stars is because it's about Slender Man. Though I'd personally recommend this film as a stoner film. It might be enjoyable to be watched intoxicated, simply laughing at every stupid scene.",

When I saw the movie when it release,I kinda feel that the characters DO kinda fit for the movie and also Slender Man does appear in movie but it's the tentacle version.The main theme of the movie is that 3 friends must find their friend who disappeared while on a school field trip.During finding their friend,Chloe,they go back to the sematary,where Chloe disappeared,to find her to see if she's alive.Things get worse when while getting her friend back,another friend,Chloe,goes missing but was later found by her friends.When Chloe goes back to her home,she later sees that someone was in her home and then was captured by slenderman by hand and acted strange to her friends.After the disappearance of the second friend, two friends,Wren and Hallie,must find a way to stop slenderman from kidnapping them and get their friends back but it never works when Hallie goes on the date and sees strange things from her boyfriends who acts possessed when it was just all in her head. When Hallie gets home,she sees her sister being possessed-like and was taken to the hospital.Now this is where the things get strange but creepy when Wren was at the library and light bulbs starts flashing on and then off and thats where you slenderman in a close up position of his blank white face and his hands and that's where she gets out of the library in fear. Back at home with Hallie,she sees that Wren took her Hallies sister into the woods,where they get to summon slenderman and Hallie goes to Wrens house and Wrens tells her that slender man wants them,which means the girls who are the main characters.The ending though was that all the main characters died or disappeared and was never seen again.Here's how the ending was: After Wren was captured by slenderman, Hallie goes into the woods to find Wren and that's where Hallie was captured by slenderman and the cameras skips to Hallies sister in a hospital bed,like shown in the first trailer,zoomed into the picture of four of the main characters who died,then into the school where they went with students in it and the movies ends with a, \"All characters died\" ending.But overall,the movie was ok and not that bad and not that scary if play the slenderman games,and 5 years late probably but its okay cause there were a lot of people in the auditorium.So if you are going to watch this movie,you'll have to watch it straight in order to get the movies plot.",

A tall, faceless, and long arms mysterious being does sound creepy when it is lurking in the forests, stalking people. The film fails to even being a scary movie. It has everything that fails in its clich\u00e9 of horror movies. Stupid teens, boring direction that lacks scares and consistent scenes. Lets not forget the plot does feel more like a rip off from The Ring movies.The characters are all bad and lacking in characteristics that you would root for. These teens made the stupid decision to watch a video of a slender man on a website. From there, Slender man is stalking these teens one by one. Luring them into the forest or traumatizing them to the part they go insane. Teens make the stupid decision and it is difficult to even care for them. Also, if it is a plot hole or something. But where are all there parents. They go walking around their homes on a school night, yelling and screaming cause something is coming inside their homes. And no adult supervision is found. Until, one of the kids ends up in a hospital and the parents finally show up out of nowhere. The direction is lacking comprehensive with its storytelling. Characters go missing when one of the girls is trying to reach her boyfriend. You really do not hear back about what happened to him.The acting is dull. Joey King, Julia Goldani Telles, Jaz Sinclair, and Annalise Basso were all tedious with their performance. The script also was lacking in characteristics with their characters. Which made it hard for you to even care for them.The plot was similar to The Ring. Except, they are being stalked by a mysterious tall, skinny, faceless man. It does have some creepy moments. But it fails with its clich\u00e9 horror storytelling. And the climax and third act gets lazy with its storytelling. That is not even sure how to end the film. With one character going insane in the hospital and decides to face the slender man herself.Overall, Slender Man is a bad film. It lacks scares and suspense. Characters make stupid decisions. Acting is boring. The direction is lazy and the script lacks in fleshing out their characters. Only good thing is Slender Man is kind of creepy.",

It's based on an internet urban legend that was created by Eric Knudsen,going by the pen name of Victor Surge-I guess that even he didn't want his real name associated with this piece of crap. The legend concerns a tall humanoid figure that is seen in photographs, usually unnoticed by everyone else in the photo, and he is also seen near children. He supposedly kidnaps the children and they are never seen again. Joey, Julia, Jaz and Annalise are high school kids that hear about the Slender Man from kids at school and decide it would be a good idea to try and conjure him up-you know high school kids are always doing dumb things when they get bored. One by one, the girls start disappearing and guess who is usually seen, right before they do a vanishing act? Yep, old Slender Man. It might have been better if they would have expanded more about what happens to the kidnapped children, once they are taken-does Liam Neeson come looking for them?-and why does he kidnap them in the first place. There are a lot of the false jumps, loud noises and people waking up from a dream scenarios that are used a lot in these cheap horror films. It's usually a sign that they are trying to cover up the poor writing.\nIt's rated \"PG-13\" for disturbing images, terror, language and sexual references and has a running time of 1 hour & 33 minutes.\nI wouldn't buy this on DVD. I wouldn't rent it either. If you really want to see this movie, I would wait until it comes to cable.",

I'm not sure how the unedited version would have turned out but either way this movie was gonna offend the real life people. At least make it worthwhile if you're gonna offend them either way! Also - there could have been many ways to do a slender man story without paralleling the real life events... if they were that worried about offending the real life people they could have taken one of those avenues... instead we're left with half of a movie using the blandest scenes they had.

            "content": "A horror movie only needs to accomplish to very simple but very important things. It needs to be atmospheric and it needs to be scary.Slender Man is definitely an atmospheric movie. Right from the start, you see the abandoned shopping mall of a sleepy town in the middle of nowhere. Most scenes take place at night, often in dark buildings or in a forest. The progressive confusion, nervosity and terror of the four main characters is also fascinating to watch.However, the movie isn't scary despite the appropriate atmosphere. The supernatural entity that gave the movie its title is quite unoriginal. It doesn't speak, it doesn't have any unforeseeable powers and it doesn't even have a face which is quite revealing. The weak attempts at jump scares are clumsy and predictable. I would go as far to say that Slender Man is one of the least scariest horror movies I have ever watched and I have come across hundreds.This would make for an average and quite lukewarm film but there are three minor elements that justify my slightly more positive evaluation. First of all, it's interesting that the movie focuses on four teenage girls instead of just boys or a mixed group which is a little bit different from the usual stereotypes. It's also great that the casting directors and writers didn't try to focus on artificial diversity, including one lesbian girl, one transgender girl, one physically disabled girl and one schizophrenic girl with borderline personality disorder. The four main characters might not have perfect chemistry but their friendship is at least believable. They are refreshingly normal.Secondly, the young actresses did a solid job. They aren't extraordinary by any means but they made the best they could with an at times shallow and unimaginative script. I really liked Joey King's acting as slightly sinister, nervous and hyperactive teenager who is a little bit different than the other three characters. I happened to find her just memorable and unique enough to not be exaggerated or even annoying. Thirdly and lastly, I liked how the movie ended. In the beginning, I found the resolution somewhat confusing and short but the more I think about it, the more I find it quite original and even courageous to end a film the way it did here. It's definitely not your standard Hollywood happy ending and this fact alone needs some praise.In the end, Slender Man is neither an ordinary nor an extraordinary horror film. It has just enough positive elements to be slightly above average or even good. I have seen far worse horror movies recently like Devil's Due or The Quiet Ones. The negative reviews of this film are often exaggerated. Horror movie fans should at least appreciate this film. Teenagers might even like it a little bit more because they could identify with the main characters.",

It's 4-5 shallow, empty characters with just enough flavor to tell them apart, and I just can't care about them.The movie focuses on the subtly of it all, the growing madness that Slender Man instills in his victims without properly building the tension or showing the characters slowly losing it, which would have given good actors the ability to save it. Instead they use a lot of \"it happened offscreen\" or sudden cuts to show a lose of time, and we get a character suddenly looking confused instead of taking the audience on a journey with the character.Maybe it's not the writing, and maybe the editor just didn't know what they were doing? \"What are all these long dramatic series in here?

It probably won't even be remembered as a campy fun horror film, like The Blob or every slasher movie ever. That said, the film did have its high points. The story was good, the creature and visual effects were fantastic, the and I oddly enough found myself entertained for the full ninety minutes. The setup for each shot once the scares started was effectively done, particularly in the forest chase scene halfway through where we can only see what they see during a rescue attempt of their missing friend, so credit to the director and cinematographer for that. Where the story falls apart, thougn, is the actual script itself, which fills the situations with so many familiar characters from the Hollywood Background Machine. Worse, it becomes so concerned with scaring you that it starts to forget its own rules (more on that later). In the end, the best thing I can say about Slender Man is that the end may have given us an excellent preview of the end battle in It: Chapter Two, and that while it was entertaining, you'd probably be better off making sure there's nothing else you want to see first.*SPOILERS SPOILERS SPOI?ERS*So by the time the end sequence rolls around, the last two girls have figured out that the sacrifice they tried to make to get their missing friend back earlier should have been a blood sacrifice. Stuff happens, they both die, and the little sister of one of the girls (who had been tricked into 'helping') is the only survivor.....and missing friend is still missing for some reason.

The ending was quite depressing, which wasn't a problem for me as I usually enjoy that sort of thing, but it was terribly done and incredibly unsatisfying. The formula for every jumpscare is the exact same so you always know when one is coming, which takes the fun out of it, not to mention a majority of them are just fakeouts to supposedly get you prepped for the 'REAL' scares, which are stupidly tame. There are no truly unexpected scares. The titular antagonist is only on screen for about a minute throughout the duration of the entire film, and his portrayal isn't even that frightening. Every scary scene has way too much buildup and not enough bang, although it does get slightly creepier within the last 10-15 minutes, but even then it isn't worth suffering through the rest of the film. I scare quite easily, but even watching it on a huge screen in a dark theater I wasn't scared in the slightest. Honestly, I could not stop laughing at how stupid the characters and their choices were and and how unscary the movie really was.

From my point of view, I have to agree with the reviews I've seen too - which is a pity as this could have been a great horror film.In short, a group of school friends attempt to disprove the existence of Slender Man, by beckoning him. When one of the friends goes missing, it becomes apparent that they were wrong in disbelief.The story has been told before, albeit with different characters bringing the scares. The way the plot unfolds, has also been done before, in some instances in the other stories I'm thinking about in that last sentence. The film actually felt like a 'lift and shift' from about 50 other movies I could name. Despite having an occasionally dumb script, the cast seem to do their best - thankfully they have to scream a few times and that detracts from the script. This film may actually go on to become the reason why the internet urban legend is killed and forgotten - pity. The 3 out of 10 I'm giving this is kind.",

            "content": "What an utter pile of trite this film was. At best, the acting was passable. There weren't any actors that I would say are phenomenal, but they were average. As for the visual effects, I will say that they were decent as well. As for the whole idea behind the Slender Man itself, I have no issues with because for there is little to no official backstory behind this internet boogeyman, so the film not really going into an explanation of what he is or where he came from is a nonissue.What is an issue is characters. All of the characters in the film hardly have personalities aside from the clich\u00e9 tropes that horror films use. Because of this, the film fails to keep you invested with the characters making their inevitable confrontation with the titular man in black lacking. This is one of the issues that several horror films share: these characters are not people. They are only there as disposable cannon fodder to be killed. As such, it's hard to care about the characters when they are in grave danger because you have no reason to.The film uses the same tired horror tropes that most average horror films employ such as using loud noises or jumpscares. Ultimately, they do nothing to mix it up or add a new spin on it. The Slender Man itself even looks bad given how it is poorly CGI-rendered. It could give one memories of 2017's The Bye Bye Man because it looks like the developers of the film took a snap of Slender Man from that 2012 game and poorly implemented it into the movie. \nUnsurprisingly, Slender Man is another bad film brought to you by Sony Pictures that is around four or five years too late. At the very least, the film is a riot to laugh at.",

We're in small suburban 'get me out of this town' America... again. These things are always set in exactly the same place aren't they. This one see's us join a group of 4 high school girls. They're bored. At a sleepover the subject of Slender Man comes up. An internet lore about a tall bloke with long arms that takes children to another place. The film's source is a muddy story, born via the internet in the early naughties. A narrative comprising different directions and ideas from a multitude of creators, no one really taking ownership. A creature designed by committee. This fundamentally is the problem with Slender Man now brought to the cinema screen. The girls watch a video on how to summon him, it's predictably spooky graphic nonsense. Some chiming bells, pagan symbols etc. Nothing happens... or does it. Wren (Joey King) is having nightmares and Katie (Annalise Basso) is oddly drawn to creaking trees in graveyards. Then Katie goes missing. It's all fairly standard stuff, largely at night, where figures are hidden in the shadows. Forests with tall trees and flashlights. Eerie music and nocturnal wildlife. Teenage occult dabblings. There's too much instant belief in the myth from the three remaining girls for this to have any bite, but I guess you have to except the tropes and hope for the best. It's biggest problem is it's reliance on jump scares, not to mention lack of substance. It's a nice simple short story at best, that even at 90 minutes feels like it's struggling to hold any interest. I'm fine with a silly suspense thriller. I don't need gore, amazing FX, not this has those, but I need a solid story and a plot that's engaging. This essentially is a bit of dull preamble, followed by a flatline hour of the three girls being stalked by Slender Man whilst they try to retrieve Katie from his clutches. One by one they're picked off, there's no ebb and flow it's just a slow creep or plod toward the end. I'll admit I do like the Slender Man design, he's a simple and elegant monster, but aesthetics alone cannot carry a film. The reports were right.",

So I just watched the movie for what it is, a movie about some scary monster.I thought it was watchable, somewhat enjoyable, though a little bit slow at times. Everyhting was pretty average. Some cool looking scenes, like the foggy forest. My favorite scene was the video call sequence where the monster(?) calls a person in the house...That was creative and genuinely chilling...a brand new take on the 80's slasher and \"Scream\" telephone tradition. Also the nightmare scenes with false awakenings and surreal imagery were cool because I like that kind of dreamlike randomness.In general I felt like the movie was a bit scarier than average horror film. Usually the monster feels just like an enemy and you know the hero is going to find some way to destroy him. But here, the monster is more eerie and abstract and creates an unnerving feeling because you start to fear for the main characters who seem to become more and more helpless against the monster.The monster itself was done pretty poorly. The concept of the character looks good on paper and has potential for super creepy scenes but that potential was not used very well. Yes, the movie is creepy, but mostly so when the monster is not visible. When he enters the picture the mood goes towards 50s' rubber suit monsters, if you know what I mean...you see the monster from close range and it just looks cheap. But even though the monster effects weren't that good, somehow the movie still has enough scarepower to stay interesting.I don't know why the movie has gotten so much bottom ratings. My guess is that fans of Slender Man internet stuff are disappointed in the movie and vote it down for protest. But for a regular horror movie watcher I say it's worth checking out once because it does have some creative quality. There are worse ways to spend your autumn night with.",

I always thought that the concept would make a good horror movie & I still think it could work, but it definetly didn't with this one. I went in open minded, because of reading a lot of sensibly sounding 5 to 6/10 reviews, and because the trailer didn't seem all that bad. With an open mind I watched the 1st 1/3 of their movie, staying positive, but it just went downhill from the starting point. I'll start with the pros, whatever few there is: Cinematography & editing were the only things that held up, it's not really visually bad, if we're judging it by what a pg-13 horror can be. It's decent and does not create problems, that made that 3.1 rating up there happen. Acting was also on level, that wasn't the aspect that will make the most cringe. What could make you cringe is the story/plot - in my opinion, this was the easiest, cheapest way to bring slender man mythos to screen - there's way more potential to this. Even bigger problem was the screenplay which simply felt lazy and lousy, as if they went with the first ideas on the whiteboard, not pushing the creative thinking it all. Basically, you've seen the whole formula too many times already. That's pretty much it, the script didn't generate any excitement, mystery or suspense, so it all came out as a flat note, a boring snooze fest. The trailer was better than the movie itself, and that has never been good. Believe an honest horror fan and stay away from this, read the creepypasta again, if you want a slender man vibe again.

How I tell ya?Now, is the story good? Well, no. It's a story. Long story short( HA!) The Slender Man movie is a compilation of \"scary\" images. There is no REAL story here, just a guy wanting to show his co-workers his film portfolio. Really, this looks like a demo-reel, a conceptual film about the character.Oh, and how, you ask, does Slendy travel around? Apparently, by watching this rip-off Ringu( (The Ring) video on a website (Yeah, not Youtube, just a website) he comes around creepin' while you're sleepin', weirdly possessing the father of the girl to attack her friends. That's what I thought at first, but NOPE. He's just insane and nothing comes out of that: He breaks into the her friend's house, tries to kill them and gets arrested later that night. Yeah, and good ol' Slendy is in the living room in a scene, but it's so dark that I can't see him. I have to REWIND even though the sound is telling me to be scared.Oh, and the ending? So confusing. I think.In short, don't watch this unless you want a really good nap.",

            "review_title": "Slender thin plot and characters: The Horror Movie Needs Some Tweaking",
            "content": "Horror movies are flooding into the theater almost as fast comedies, and despite the mediocre reviews they continue to be churned out at the breakneck speed. Tonight, despite a Sci-Fi horror releasing this week, a second horror wants to take a stab at winning the box office battle. Robbie K here, bringing you another movie review to help guide your viewing pleasures. Let's get started as I share my opinions on: Movie: Slenderman (2018)Director:\n Sylvain White\nWriters:\n David Birke, Victor Surge (based on a character by) \nStars:\n Joey King, Julia Goldani Telles, Jaz Sinclair \nLIKES: Short Run Time\nGood Cinematography\nMakeup/Visuals\nDesign of Antagonist\nOkay Acting Slenderman doesn't have much going for it for me, but at least the movie is at a short run time of about 80 minutes, so you don't have to put up with too long of a movie (assuming you stay for the whole show). The faster pace film has packs plenty of creepy-crawly mood to it, mostly thanks to the cinematography and setting designed for the movie. Bring in the makeup and visuals to further add that shadow of sadness/doom alongside the realistic setting and you an even strong case of being disturbed by the movie. Slenderman's various actions really can get under your skin, and once his form is solidly captured on set, you might get the final ambience of shivering in your skin as the CGI monster stalks the \"heroines\". As for the cast, they do well with the direction they were guided down, but I can't say more outside of that. DISLIKES: The Characters\nThe Disturbing Imagery\nPlot Holes\nChaotic Camera Work\nAimless Direction Unfortunately, the dislikes pile up, more so in how stereotypical this movie went forgoing any originality and potential for superficial gimmicks. The first aspect are the characters, very shallow teenagers who not only dug themselves a major hole in this film, but refusing to change. The static development leaves little to root for, nor any promise that things are going to go well for the teenage girls. Sadly, the girls primary growth occurs in their ability to tolerate the awful images the CGI ghost brings with him. Like the Ring, these visuals are not the most pleasing to watch and some felt unnecessary to include, thereby making their inclusion all the more pointless. Instead they should have worked on the story, for it had many plot holes and dead ends that were disappointing to say the least. Slenderman's avenues are quickly interrupted by prolonged bouts of cat and mouse games, where the camera work fails to capture all the details you wanted to see. In addition, the movie did not succeed in taking a firm direction, leading to this spiral of hodge-podge horror that left me bored, listless, and counting the minutes for this predictable film to end. I'll applaud the nods to other horror movies, but this piece meal needed some refining to bring Slenderman out to his full horror. The Verdict:  Slenderman looked insane, and it delivered on that quite well in regards to the mental war it plays on the girls. Your scares come from realistic setting and camera work, but outside of that there is little to harp on. The movie's story is unfocussed, needing some editing and rewrites to really dive into the tale they wanted to present. In addition, deeper characters and better focus on the CGI villain is a must if the series is to survive. As such, I can't recommend this movie for theater, nor is it worth your time at most rental sites (unless you are a teen looking to test your merit). Given everything coming out save your money and target those movies in the near future. \nMy Scores: Horror: 4.0\nMovie Overall: 3.0-3.5",

            "review_title": "Oh Dear...",
            "content": "For those who want to know; is Slender Man a good horror film, the basic answer is...not really. For the longer answer, let's strap ourselves in and analyze this mess. Going into this film, I had heard multiple stories; none of them good. I'm not going to focus on the film's tastelessness in bringing to life an internet legend that resulted in a disturbingly horrific crime. By the time this film premiered, the Slender Man craze had come and gone, and despite there been so much material for this film to use, it is really quite two-dimensional.To the film's credit, there are some genuinely creepy scenes that do create a sense of dread, with great use of imagery occasionally used. The functional original score does add to the sustained threat, the drum beat used when Slender Man is near being especially effective, though even the soundtrack can't save the film, with some of the 'scary' devices shamelessly repeated, causing the effect to be significantly reduced. As the film progresses, it begins taking clich\u00e9 horror tropes from better known franchises, in particular, The Ring, including a cursed video and a girl in desperate need of a hair-cut. If parroting classics wasn't enough, there are sequences of trippy hallucinations, in which POV shots that incorporate Hitchcock's dolly-zoom technique are used, alongside bizarre transitional effects that make little sense. During one 'horror' moment I burst out laughing, and unless Slender Man is secretly a parody, this represents a failure on the filmmaker's part.What doesn't help the horror are the film's characters. Two issues; first, I would be hard-pressed to describe any of them, considering the significant lack of characterization. Second, the main character is boring. Stereotypically in horror films, the protagonist tries to warn a group of rational-minded individuals who refuse to accept the truth, of the supernatural threat. This movie however, probably thinking it was being intelligent, flips this on its head, whereby the lead character is the one with their head in the sand. Hallie (Julia Goldani Telles) is a plank of wood, who isn't particularly likable, for A) her refusal to accept the truth, even when she sees Slender Man watching her, B) the inconsiderate attitude she demonstrates for her friends, being more smitten for a guy than her BFFs, C) her choice to ignore her sister (Taylor Richardson), and D) the idiotic decisions her character makes that put her, and others, at unnecessary risk.If you knew there was an evil entity in the woods, would you go there? Well, these characters do. Perhaps I should now talk about the 'plot'. Hallie, along with her three friends, Wren (Joey King), Chloe (Jaz Sinclair) and Katie (Annalise Basso), during a sleepover, decide to summon Slender Man, which is as easy as clicking on a link. The three girls are all affected by the 'ritual', eventually leading to one predictably disappearing. There is also Tom (Alex Fitzalan), who is shoehorned in as a potential love-interest, and whose narrative is largely unfulfilled in the five odd minutes he appears in. Besides the contrived nature of the plot, the second biggest issue is that the feature doesn't focus upon Wren, who is the film's most intriguing character, demonstrating a determination to help others, studious investigative skills, and courage; three qualities that the other characters lack.This is only exacerbated by the utter stupidity of the characters. Their investigation into how to put an end to Slender Man's pursuit leads them to an 'expert' online, who provides strict guidelines that must be followed to the letter. Do you think more than one character decides to do the complete opposite? You would be right. Do you think more than one character does exactly what they were told not to do? Two for two. This makes feeling sympathetic for the characters a challenge, for how can you feel sorry for anyone who lacks total common sense and reasoning?That said, the film is almost entirely logical...until the 2/3 mark where we get to a hospital sequence. Then it devolves into a contradictory, illogical mess. There is a twist around this part, though it was less a shocker, and more of an 'Oh, that's what's happening, eh?' Over the course of the feature, we occasionally receive glimpses of the world Slender Man inhabits, and in so doing, we can almost imagine the kind of film we could have received. All ghosts are meant to have 'rules' that they abide by, and the lacking complexity surrounding the antagonistic force is disappointing to say the least.Why is he summoned from the internet? How is he able to affect technology? Why does he wear a fancy three-piece suit? Why doesn't he have a face? How come he occasionally has tentacles? Why does he exclusively target children and teenagers? What is his secret to being so thin? I know the film is based upon an urban legend conceived entirely online, and the audience could do some investigation of their own, but still, refusing to add depth to the film's title villain is just lazy screen-writing.Slender Man is ultimately...fine, but it doesn't succeed in developing a compelling or thought-provoking narrative. Neither does it effectively create a nightmarish fantasy that will ruin your sleep. You can watch it once, though repeated viewing may potentially damage your intelligence.",

Why bother with any of these normal film essentials, when the dim, murky gray final product would obscure it all? SLENDER MAN comes from Sony, the official propaganda arm of Japan's so-called government. Sore losers Hell-bent upon seeking revenge over a World War Two that THEY started and lost, Japan has been using Sony to launch one sneak attack after another upon unsuspecting American film-goers. (SLENDER MAN begins with an on-screen warning that it may cause epileptic seizures and other dire psychological side effects.)

I'll admit it was epic but at the same time it was creepy & scary enough & better than other supernatural films which are blander, boring & let's face it, over rated to the core & made simply for the sake of film snobs & not causal viewers. The film is about the creepy internet & creepy pasta urban legend, Slender Man! Like Jeff The Killer, he's an urban myth demon, who takes children by luring them in. He gets in your head & then reels you into the dark abyss with him!Now there isn't a lot of complexity to this film, but I think that's great considering it makes a change from seeing other boring, complex & overload horrors designed to be made for snobby people as a pose to having a fun critic free night with mates to have a laugh with. The films story-line was simply & I liked it that way.The characters were good too, (beautiful) but the main focus was the horror villain himself. The visuals were pretty good too & the blandness of the film was designed to be like that on purpose to fit in with the films grim, dark & foreboding tone! So those moaning about the bland part obviously were wanting a comedy like film, you're in the wrong cinema screen if that's what you wanted. Though the gore was absent from this, I knew what type of horror this was & in fact wasn't bad. The film was also good for the run time & not too long & dragged out! 1 hour & 26 minutes.Though the film was a little bit weak & dull in a few places I overall thought it wasn't a bad film at all!

Not that I expected anything spectacular. But the photos with this cult figure, which popped up on the internet, were rather intriguing. Not really scary but mysterious. A faceless figure with disproportionate limbs who appears in the background while observing children playing. A kind of Pied Piper of Hamelin who lures innocent children and makes them disappear. The fact this creation is the result of an internet competition is widely known. I was only curious if this figure would convince in a horror film. Well, it's not really innovative. You'll see the same clich\u00e9s again. And the same stupidities and bad decisions are made by those who are about to become a victim. And the same tricks out of \"Horror for dummies\" are applied.And yet, I didn't think it was bad. \"Slender man\" certainly isn't such a big fiasco as you might think. It isn't as disastrous as the comments you can read here and there on the internet. It won't go down in history as one of the most frightening or bloody horrors of all time. And the obscure and dark images creates an appropriate atmosphere but also ensure that you can't see a damn thing most of the time. But I felt that constant threat and the fear among the four teenage girls. And no, I won't have panic attacks immediately when hearing the sound of crackling wood. But these sound effects did create a creepy mood.Normally I am such a person who whines about the fact that too little background information is given in a film. You are kept in the dark (appropriate for this movies) in terms of the origin and arising of the particular creepy phenomenon. With \"Slender Man\", however, I didn't think this was necessary. It made Slender Man even more mysterious. Summoning malicious demons also isn't exactly something new. Only recently you could see in \"Pyewacket\" how a frustrated teenage girl evoked something similar with the help of an occult ritual. And a long time ago, a group of young adults played a tape in \"The Evil Dead\" which caused Kandarian spirits to ruin everything. In \"Slender Man\" the cause of all the misery is a video on YouTube. Maybe that fits with today's time, but perhaps this bothered me the most. They tried to make it too hip. Especially when afterwards this ancient legend also knows about mobile phone technology.Maybe that's the problem with this movie. They focused more on the continuation of the internet hype and tried to make a modern horror out of it. They lost sight of the concept of a well-thought-out horror. Maybe it fits perfectly with the life the four teenage girls Wren (Joey King), Hallie (Julia Goldani Telles), Chloe (Jaz Sinclair) and Katie (Annalize Basso) lead. A group of carefree teenagers who gained a certain popularity status at school (as seen in so many other Highschool films) and show an everyday affinity with current modern technology. They have more affection for their smartphone than for their fellow students. Yes, they display a kind of arrogance. To such an extent that they simply ignore the warnings for watching the video. Until one of them suddenly disappears and they realize that they might be stalked by this lugubrious figure.Want to know my conclusion in the end? The whole legend created around this Slender Man was much more interesting than the film itself. All in all, it wasn't original and I didn't see anything baffling new in this film. But I still found certain scenes successful. Such as the one in the library with the use of a sort of psychedelic footage. And throughout the film, there are more of those hallucinatory passages. Also, I didn't think the acting was that awful. Ok, sometimes the four girls acted rather childish during meaningless conversations. And yes, some of their decisions were downright stupid. But that suited these young girls. And finally, I also thought the appearance of the mysterious Slender Man was reasonably successful. He blended perfectly with the background so you had this feeling that he could appear at any time. It's Javier Botet again who has put his peculiar physique at the service to play this nasty character. Just like he did in \"Mama\", \"Don't knock twice\" and \"Mara\". No, \"Slender Man\" wasn't disastrous, but seasoned horror fanatics will look at it in a rather condescending way. Beginners, on the other hand, might be afraid this faceless figure will show up. After all, they've seen a large part of the illustrious video. Not?",

I am of course talking about the incredible make out scene one of the girls who I can't remember the name of and some dude idk. Their romantic chemistry was built up throughout the movie especially the scene where they exchange glances - that part was just incredible. Anyway so they're making out and then the Slender Dude makes her start to hallucinate and the boyfriend starts to freak out screaming. Never have I laughed so hard in my life. It was like a terrible attempt at after effects - this was intentional of course.Overall, Slender Man is a modern masterpiece.It has just the right blend of comedy and story that makes it a super entertaining movie to sit through.And that's why I gave Slender Man 1/10",

There have been a few fan films made but this is the long overdue film which fans of the Slender Man character have been waiting for, but was it worth the wait? I am afraid not, not by a long shot which is such a shame because the Urban Myth, character and subsequent games could have ensured a massive audience but with its simple yet predictable story this isn't even scary in the slightest, yes better than the extremely silly Hereditary. In my personal opinion the film is just wrong and could have been far better, take the Urban Myth about Candy man (I dare you to say Candy Man 3 times) which actually acknowledged the Urban Myth or was it, this film from the start takes more 'its real' path and is let down because of it. I will put it to you, what is more scary, an Urban Myth that could be true or an Urban Myth that is ignored and made out to be real? One could be in the real world and the other you know isn't. This is the underlying reason why Slender Man has been so popular but the film will spoil the whole Urban Myth surrounding Slender Man and not add to it, which is an opportunity lost.

            "content": "Slender Man is a confusing abomination that is barely watchable and doesn't make a lick of sense despite very little actually happening throughout the entire film. There was a real life murder over Slender Man some while back, and for some reason Sony decided to whip this movie together and then back out after realizing it might be a tad tasteless or offensive, and thus they cut it down drastically and that's how we're left with this hollow husk of a movie that has to be seen for one to understand just how broken it is. It's possibly comparable to The Snowman, but I haven't seen that one. If you watch the trailers for Slender Man, and then the movie, you'll notice the boyfriend character from the trailer fails to make an appearance and several shots from the trailer alone fail to appear.What I think needed to be done to make this film worthwhile would be to have upped the ante if anything, making it more violent and wallowing in the tasteless nature of it, or making it a documentary on the real life murder, which is a vastly scarier and darker tale than the hogwash we get here. None of the characters are memorable whatsoever as they are all basically the same generic teenage girl characters, interchangeable from one another and equally ditsy with insane lines of logic throughout which somehow work out in one way or another due to plot convenience and poor writing and very little effort given in this project as a whole. This is only furthered with abhorrent pacing, with many slow, meandering shots thrown in of supposed visions, which are ultimately time-fillers to reach the 90 minute mark with inoffensive cheap shots of the wilderness. The image quality is downright gross and it's one of the hardest films to stare at for prolonged periods of time due to its disgusting color palette, horrible filters, and dull shot compositions.This movie is one of the most boring pieces of rubbish ever made, and thus I can't even recommend it as so bad it's good, because you're likely to fall asleep rather than so much as chuckle.",

Although following precisely the instructions from the clip, the girls say that everything is nonsense, but when the suddenly begin to have nightmares about the creature and one of them goes missing, their sanity and also friendship will be put to the test.It's a supposedly horror movie which introduces the legend of Slender Man and how four girls get involved in his stories. I say supposedly because it almost not scary at all. It bases solely on jump-scares, a cheap tactic which makes the viewer startle, but without a truly scary atmosphere or creature which can generate this type of emotion. Speaking of the atmosphere, it is mostly dull, lacking suspense, drama or any sense of empathy towards the characters, making the whole action truly pointless.The plot is simply stupid. It bases its entire action on the summoning of a mystical creature, which is also as dumb as it gets, which will do what it does best to take care of the main characters, one by one. You get no drama, no suspense, no emotion... just pure linearity and also predictability. The characters are very simple, not well developed, acting strange and making irrational decisions in key moments, eliminating any chance of caring for their fate. It's almost laughable when you see how they react in different situations; that's how bad they are.In order to describe the creature, the movie uses some \"special\" effects which are sometimes so bad that they seem to be made in a coffee break using last century's technology. You can only imagine how disappointing or even laughable this can get, when judging the fact that they should induce fear or at least drama. Another aspect which is to be mentioned is the finale. I honestly expected it to bring something different, something that might make the previous hour and a half a bit less pointless. Unfortunately, as with the rest of the film, it fails miserably do deliver anything out of the ordinary, ending suddenly and almost without any clue.As you might have guessed by now, this movie is a disaster. It isn't able to be what it was supposed to be, a horror movie, it fails to deliver a decent story or characters and it really fails to generate fear, drama, suspense or anything like these, except a couple of cheap jump-scares. It's a truly awful movie which should be avoided at any cost.",

Wishful freakin thinking. Instead, Slender Man is literally as bad as they get. Just think Bye Bye Man mixed with Jeepers Creepers 3 bad. The directing is really awful and it most of the editing and shots are super lazy and boring. It feels like they just got the director of one of those crappy teen dance movies..oh, wait, that's exactly what they did! And it shows. Most of the actors are bad but it usually looks like poor direction than bad acting. The script SUUUUUUUCKS and is literally the most cliche modern horror film ever, like a computer wrote it or something. The Slender man himself acts nothing like he does in the games or in the lore, and he actually runs around chasing people and roaring! Remember back in the awesome game when he just stands there staring at you from a distance? Remember how haunting that was how he didn't even move? Well now he runs and chases people like a zombie from The Walking Dead. Worst of all, the film just isn't scary and instead it's attempts to scare you are just really funny! You're blind if you don't see 99% of the jump scares coming and most of them are over the dumbest things. There's a scene with a girl in a library and you know a jump scare is coming...and it's just the librarian who walks past the camera in the most boring unclimatic way possible, like the director told her to not be scary...but the music is SO INTENSE when it happens, like this librarian walking past the camera was just the freakiest thing in the history of cinema! The entire movie is like this, just a painfully generic and boring modern horror film with nothing interesting, unique, fresh, or good. I gave it a bonus star because SOME of the cinematography shots are nice, and the musical score is occasionally good, although still a bit basic.

            "content": "For fanantics of the mythos and meme, Slender Man is too little too late. Slendy has been given mockumentary web shows (in addition to the awesome Marble Hornets) and plenty of fan films better than this supposed real deal, not to mention the popularity he was granted when an unfunny Let's Player screamed at some video games he was in. NOTE: One scene includes honest-to-God Deviantart images of the eponymous creature.It isn't original or interesting as a film on its own, either. Its similarities with the Ringu series have been noted, and it fails to translate to film that which sounds intriguing when presented as a creepypasta; a purportedly legitimate blog accompanied by an ominous series of inexplicable YouTube clips. That close-to-home realism and, dare I say it, found-footage camera work is what made the mythos believable and effective. This film is visibly more expensive, stars obvious actors (bad ones), is shot like any other movie, and has an OST by the talented Ramin Djawadi, albeit asleep at the wheel with this one.I don't mean to say that the Slender Man can't ever appear in a feature-length horror film with a budget. It's just that his is a story that works best when you read it in an email, see strange videos immediately afterwards, and soon begin to pay attention to noises from far away, as well as your own coughs. If you want to make a full-on movie about him - especially years after the Slendy ship has sailed and people are more horrified by American politics than forest-dwelling monsters that cause space-time disruptions and insanity - you'll want to make something less derivative, poorly acted, unironically formulaic and bland than Slender Man.",

The worst thing about the movie is it's boringness. The 90 minutes felt like 2 hours. Aside from that, the movie was predictable, laughable and und dumb. Pretty much every horror cliche was used in the screenplay, I guess. The characters were actually no characters due to non existent personality. Worst thing was by far how they depicted Slenderman on screen. They used CGI to create him and obviously didn't had the budget or talent to make him look realistic. When you could actually see him in all his \"glory\" at the end, he remembered me of a not fully rendered character from an animated movie of the 2000s. That's the reason for the horrible pun in my review-title. If you really want to watch this terrible flick, than look out for the date scene with our protagonist's boyfriend. It's hilariously bad.",

For example: it consists entirely out of wood, and so do the tentacles, or branches in this case. There is no suit, it is just the wood giving the illusion that it's wearing a suit. The teleportation was also kept in (although it used walking or hovering most of the time), and so were the drawings. But what surprised me the most was his \"final\" form at the end of the movie, which I won't spoil, but it is heavily inspired by an internet image made long before the movie.Honestly, I thought it was great if you have an interest in the character, but it definitely is not your money worth if you just want to see a horror movie. The CGI in one scene was definitely bad, the branches moving at his back looked awfully fake. And the movie was too dark in my opinion. But overall, the acting was great and so was the soundtrack and setting.",

            "content": "Through a feminist lens and applying environmentalist objectivism, this movie showcases the modern fear of environmental destruction resulting in devastating personal consequences. By making the beloved character of The Lorax into a terrifying emblem of masculinity and misogyny, viewers are left to question their environmental impact and their roles within society.The frequent symbolism of the oppression of the developing female body manifests through sensationalized imagery about the misunderstandings and stigma again representative of society's views. As feminism and environmentalism often go hand in hand, the film pays homage by using an actual image of a young pregnant woman birthing the roots for a revolution as far as environmental destruction pervades our society.The scene in the library helps the viewers visualize The Lorax's other hunting ground, as wooden shelves (the tortured and disfigured products of logging) are forced to cradle even more flayed and minced products of deforestation of Mother Earth. The Lorax is angered by this blatant disregard for the gifts of Nature and attacks one of the young women. While herself not a perpetrator of environmental destruction, she is struggling with her own development, and the conflict between environmentalism and feminism is representative of the way the patriarchy turns the oppressed against one another to distract from the oppression they face.In conclusion, this reinvention of the classic \"Lorax\" tale showcases the patriarchal fears of the consequences of oppression regarding deforestation and misogyny. The true message, as explained in the final scenes of the film, is that women must embrace environmentalism as a symbiosis to free themselves from misogyny and, at the same time, lift up the most powerful female entity of them all: Mother Nature.",

If anything, I'd recommend it solely for Joey King. She steals the show. You almost forget she's not the main character. If it weren't for the boring nothing characters that were made, I'd almost think it was about her and her friends, but then we go back to Hallie for the final act after spending time with Wren for like 30 or so minutes.

Indie survival horror games were made. And an unknown group of internet filmmakers expanded on the whole thing with their \"Marble Hornets\" series. And you know what's sad? When a group of film students with no real budget and bargain basement equipment can make a better movie and more interesting and layered story than a big budget movie house you know something is wrong. This movie is boring. It's dull. It's plodding and there's literally nothing to like about it. I was interested in seeing how Slenderman would be depicted on the big screen. But in the end it's just another example of how Hollywood doesn't understand the source material and messes it up every single time.

It has some intriguing visuals and some nice cinematography (most of the time), so it wasn't a complete waste.I see this as the kind of thing young teen girls would rent for their slumber parties, because that's the only future this film has.

White also refrains from going overboard on jump scares, and cuts down on the potential for cheesiness. The whole thing is suffused with a great deal of dread & atmosphere.

If the 16 year old part of me didn't like it, the 12 year old me definitely did. I have been a huge fan of him and his games back in 2013. I thought that a movie based on him felt like a good way to get him into mainstream again. I feel like it did it's job. The Story felt lack luster, The CG where tendrils explode through the mirror and where Tom's Head was shaking rapidly and making a distorted face felt unfinished, there was many Cliches and missed opportunities here and there. Slender Man himself looked pretty amazing, seeing him always left me with a smile on my face. The library scene has to be the best scene in the movie, it is executed very perfectly, and The Scene where Slender Man rises on his tentacles made me smile so wide, teeth were showing.

In these wooded scenes, we get the classic \"screen's too bright, so this black is actually a light grey\" and everything is indecipherable. We get layers of different shades of black, and hardly anything can be seen. So, ultimately, you're paying to see a film that you can't even see most of the runtime. Of course a fan of the movie may argue that this is on purpose to create a mysterious atmosphere, blah blah blah. I've seen enough films to know that this error is plain and simply that: an error.

I see no reason why to give \u00abSlender Man\u00bb such a low rating and bad comments, as if their lives depended on trashing it. After I saw and read the unfair (and coarse) reactions to Oz Perkins' beautiful and poetic \u00abI Am the Pretty Thing That Lives in the House\u00bb in 2017, I do not trust the judgment of horror audiences anymore. It became obvious to me that we have very different definitions of horror and that we like quite different kinds of ways to evoke fear and human magical thinking. \u00abSlender Man\u00bb is not even half as good as Perkins' motion picture, but it is efficiently packed, tense and scary. The problems I find about the movie are that its fable is underdeveloped, the profile of its horror source (the Slender Man) is underdone, the plot needed more elaboration and the creators should have gotten rid of some visually effective but dramatically pointless pieces. Just consider the scene when Hallie wanders through the corridors of the hospital where her sister is. It is a succession of gratuitous images to make the movie a bit longer. We have already seen many movies about girlfriends messing with the occult, we have seen the disappearance or killing of those kids dozens of times, and we have heard similar conclusions, told in the grave tone of the final narration, which are as silly as in this one. It is a pity then, because it speaks a lot about American fears, about the roots of terror in American folklore. It would have benefitted from more research and creative scriptwriting. As it is, \u00abSlender Man\u00bb only achieved a small part of its purposes, but I am sure that you have seen a lot much worse \"pelis\" than this.",

I loved the Slenderman games and find them incredibly unnerving to play (particularly alone in the dark with headphones on) and when I heard this movie was being made I was certainly intrigued. I mean this is such a mysterious character. That means that the movie has unlimited options in terms of what sort of story to tell.\nHowever, once the trailer was released I knew what we were getting: a movie that is weird for the sake of being weird. But...as a fan of the games (and someone with too much time on their hands due to the recent development of insomnia) I decided to give it a watch. I checked IMDB beforehand just to see how it was being rated. 3.1! I've NEVER seen a movie being rated so poorly. But, the comments were fairly positive. In fact, many of them claimed they didn't understand why the movie was receiving so much hate.\nI'll tell you why:\n1. The story is one of the most poorly written stories I've ever had the misfortune of experiencing. From the moment the movie starts, every single character is a cliche. Somehow, they manage to all be cliches and yet are still entirely underdeveloped. The character development is little to none and any character development that does take place is done through the characters themselves actually saying it.\n2. The sound effects used in this movie are supposed to resemble the game (I assume) but they happen at random times, they don't sound creepy, and worst of all, you can see that the creators were under the impression that cheap-sounding special effects would help set the tone...they don't.\n3. Without giving away any spoilers, you can actually see, moment by moment, all the other movies that this one took inspiration from (I say inspiration but it is closer to plagiarism.All in all, rather than leaving me scared or unnerved, this movie has actually managed to make Slenderman seem less like a horror characters and more like a spoof of one. If you'd added some jokes here and there, this movie could easily have been considered a horror movie spoof because it's THAT far away from being scary!",

At worst, it's Wren during the second half when she's always panicking or crying. The dialogue the leads are given usually sucks, especially during those first few scenes where they're basically speaking in teen angst mode.The whole plot kicks off because the girls watch a clickbait video on some shady message board, for no reason, and we're supposed to believe that this successfully contacts Slender Man (it actually comes across more like a hypnosis or brainwashing video, curiously). Katie allows herself to be taken by him, then the rest of the girls accidentally let him in by performing a ritual to try and get her back. Most of the film, then, is just spooky scenes and situations - Slender Man hacks into the girls' Sony phones and gives them video calls (twice!), but mostly he just torments them with hallucinations.The hallucinations and nightmares at least have some creepy imagery like Hallie lying naked in pieces under piles of leaves, a girl in a bathtub with a caved-in face, and tentacles coming out of eyes and mouths. Not like any of that means anything. There are also some nice shots of scenery around the town and in the woods, lovely camera movements, and beautiful shots like Hallie looking out of her bedroom window, illuminated by police lights. The music video-like editing is a problem, though, and it makes the sexual angst scene between Hallie and Tom look really stupid as he writhes about with a monster face.This is a movie that really plays on those horror tropes, without understanding what makes those tropes work. Jump-scares abound, characters have angst, and the sexual undertones of films like \"Halloween\" (1978) and \"It Follows\" (2014) are badly imitated.3/10.",

It's frustratingly all a case of been there, seen that. The jump scares, well didn't make me jump. But there are handful of redeeming features in the film. The four actress did a fine job. I also thought that, there were moments of threat that were genuinely decent. On a couple of occasions the girls see footage on their phones of someone/something from that person's/ thing's POV. I quite liked those scenes. There is also some good imagery and sound work, these also helped in creating a mild sense of horror.

There's so much that could be bashed upon through technical views, though to keep it simple, this film in general is a collection of lifeless, flat, completely overused horror cliches. The suspense factors were at an all time low, mostly, since the film made every build-up as obvious as possible, almost every single jumpscare, and abysmally slow-paced \"suspenseful\" execution was blatantly obvious, leaving nothing truly horrifying or new to speak of. The jumpscares, mostly, are cheap, laughable, and even head-scratching, mostly. ( The entire theater laughed at a specific jumpscare, even. ) The characters mostly find themselves in situations that lead nowhere, with some happening for the sake of fill-time, really it'd seem. They carry a small bit of life with their characters, but such can be seen mostly in the first quarter of the film, the time where things were organized. Otherwise, the film began to feel rushed, sudden, and in general a confusing, random seeming ordeal. In all honesty, aside my love of horror, seeing this film was sheer luck; I knew this film wasn't going to be great by the 3.4 or so rating at the time. To wrap things up, if you're fond or in general a fan of Slenderman, I'd recommend this for a laugh. This truly isn't the worst, but it's surely wasted potential; Slenderman as an idea seems as if it needs a lot of ideas to carry a whole film, this didn't carry a whole lot. Cliches, laughable moments, CGI Slenderman, and confusion moments that'll have you thinking. That's what you'll take away from this film.

My god was the acting awful, a well earned razzie nomination for [actress's name I forgot], congrats! But honestly the actors deserved a lot better, really isn't their fault they just had to run, get predictably jumpscared (I'll get to THAT later) and scream at some atrocious CGI for most of the film. Oh, if only there was a zero rating I could put. But its not just the poor cast, Slenderman doesn't deserve this either. one of the most famous horror tales and one that creeped out many during its popularity, especially me, being transformed into completely the opposite of what it was, and made into something so laughable it looks like it would be one of the parodies in Scary Movie. Poor old Slendy is barely in the film either, less than 5 minutes screentime in total and the occasional jumpscare appearance. Speaking of jumpscares, the ones in this film are some of the most clich\u00e9 and hilarious attempts of surprising/shocking the audience I have ever witnessed. The sheer amount of predictability in them is unbelievably stupid. The simple pan to one side, nothing there, Oh no! Then pan to the other, and there's nothing there either! Big surprise right? And then just when the character thinks they're safe and there is nothing there after all, they turn around and BOO! These are done so lazily, and it pains me to see that Blumhouse still uses them in their films, Invisible Man being an exception. Now I love Psychological horrors, Midsommar, Hereditary you name it. But that doesn't mean that I still don't like jumpscares. They can be used really well, in stuff like the original Insidious, or in IT. But this film misses every shot. I don't see the need to make the film a Pg-13, since when was Slenderman for people at that age? And I know, I know, pg-13 doesn't always ruin films. But with films like this and Venom, it does feel off. I'm going on and on so i'll finish my review here.\nVerdict: Lazy writing, bad acting and hilariously bad scenes drag this film down deep into 1 star territory and up to the point where it may even offend Slender fans.

The only thing that makes it just barely likeable is the fact that it's at least watchable.From the start, and heading all the way through to the climatic point and the finishing, Slender Man is a horror movie that feels more like a teen coming-of-age movie. It should've stuck to at least trying to be scary or haunting in any way, but the focus on the stereotypical teenage life is still quite appealing. The trailer certainly seems like a lie in telling us this was a horror movie, not a teen tale with a freaky mystery.The storytelling is really dragging and utterly predictable, meaning that yes, you can sense the \"jump\"-scares from minutes away and the actual theme itself could've successfully been more mysterious and ominous, which makes already makes it a missed opportunity.

The acting was really cheesy and over the top too. There is practically no build up and no suspense, they just throw the action at you. There are so many things that they could have done to make this a decent movie, but it was an obvious cash grab that played on a popular topic among tweens and teens. My daughter liked it but she said it wasn't scary, just annoyingly loud. The only comment she had to make of the movie was that it was \"interesting\".",

My review is probably bad because the movie was so bad because it was that bad that I just can't explain it. I guess the people that liked it are idiots or just ones that like pointless dumb movies.

The movie has the actual drawings I saw on some websites and creeped me out when I was younger, also some scenes are straight from the game Slender Man : The 8 Pages. The movie really highlights the creepypasta theme, and how it is viral and from the dark parts of the internet. I really liked that. The movie seems to introduce a form of being haunted really similar do The Ring, I don't recall having that on the original story, but I actually liked their approach. The movie really depicts what fear feels like. I felt serious chills down my spine. The movie soundtrack and effects are SPOT on and very immersive, those 3 bells really set the scene to Panic Mode. Also, the hallucination scenes were awesome. I loved this movie to all its extents, my girl thought didn't like it all, I think most people would have the same reaction to it as she did.

Wow this was a terrible movie. I never expected much in the first place. When they first announced that the movie would be made I thought maybe they could make a decent horror movie out of it. Then the first trailer arrived. It was a bunch of random creepy images and didn't even involve Slender Man at all. That's when I knew it would receive horrible reviews. It currently has an 11% on Rotten Tomatoes, 29 on Metascore, and 3/10 on IMDb. The plot was horrible. Very predictable, a bunch of jump scares, stupid decisions, and many laughable moments. The cast was horrible except for Annalise Basso, who is actually a good actress. But the order of disappearances for the girls goes from best actress to worst actress. Because of that the whole ending was so painful to watch. It was pretty funny to watch. The last 5ish minutes was hilarious. Because I don't care I'm going to spoil it. The girl we're left with is freaking out because of everything that's been happening so she goes to the woods to give her life to Slender Man so it can all end. When Slender Man goes in to full monster mode to take her she runs away screaming. Like a few seconds ago she wanted to give her life. Another hilarious moment with that girl is there's a part where she goes over to this one guy's house and they're about to have sex. She looks at his face and it's violently shaking with a smile and the room is spinning and she's screaming. It was one of the funniest scenes in a movie I've seen all year. The last dumb scene I'll talk about came earlier in the movie. Annalise (the good actress) went missing and the three girls go into the woods at night to get rid of something they love as a sacrifice to Slender Man so they can get her back. The girls are supposed to be blindfolded and not to look because if they see his face they'll be messed up forever. Of course one of the girls gets scared so she takes off her blindfolds and sees him, which had horrible effects and looked dumb. Then it's just a bunch of screaming and tripping through the woods followed by fake jump scares. There is not much good I can say about the movie. The only things are that Annalise was a good actress for the 15 minutes she was in the movie and there was maybe two instances where it was sort of creepy. Honestly it could've been a good movie if they did a plot similar to the video game, like a found footage thing with the plot of the game. Instead we got some funny jumbled movie with bad acting from Julia Goldani Telles and Joey King (who has been in horrible horror movies recently). This movie is going to win some Razzie Awards for sure. Don't see it. Don't waste your money. If you want to watch laughable horror film then this is the movie for you.My Grade: D",

I couldn't wait for it to be over.I could excuse the bad acting, cause yes, the actresses probably did the best they could with a bad script. The script did not bother to make the group of girls original or likeable, the one thing accurately shown about them is what teens do when they get together.\nHowever the lighting was unforgivable. I don't know where their budget went but they should have invested in a few more lights, as it was really hard to make things out (even though I was watching with the brightness to the max) and the shades being sliced in clear lines did not make it in the least a professional looking production.I know they probably really tried to have the climax of the film be all creepy, but again, clich\u00e9s. There was a clear lack of originality but one aspect of the film that was actually a little redeemable was their one use of trees at the end of the film; that was interesting, but I wouldn't say it's worth watching the film for that.",

Bunch of teenagers find spooky video one of them goes missing ahhhhh fight breaks loose amongst the group, random cheap jump scares with an obnoxious noise. But this set up is at least tolerable if you really like horror but they manage to just make every single basic element just down-right awfulThe movie is not scary, at all. There are cheap jumpscares everywhere with the most obnoxious and stupid sounds I think I've ever heard. Honestly by the 10th fake-out jumpscare I just laughed. The movie is also for some reason just incredibly dark and I couldn't see anything and Slender man looks just as bad as the terrible photoshops you would find online. For some reason the characters just hallucinate stupid ass distorted demon faces on people and the cgi is atrocious. All of these factors just don't build up any tension at any point in the movie and as a result who cares what happensI need to talk about the characters and acting because it is just something else. I do not believe for a second any of the actors cared enough about this terrible movie to bother trying because they are all so boring. Every scene where anything is happening they don't seem to care at all. Joey King's character just goes on speeches asking her own friends for help and they literally just don't respond or only say one word answers it's absolutely mind boggling. It is hilarious when the characters just say random plot points and it feels so unnatural. They are all 0 dimensional characters with not a single interesting quality.One of the reasons the movie is so boring is it completely lacks personality. The movie is so dreary but it doesn't make up for it with a compelling story or compelling characters with realistic and/or interesting emotions, behavior, and arcs. Sad and dreary does not mean your movie has to also have nothing interesting within it.If I'm being honest I don't know how I would bring slender man into a movie as I don't know much about him but the way they do it in this movie I don't really like at all. In the movie he feels less like an impending threat of him always watching and instead just feels like some stupid cgi monster with tentacles. I think one huge pitfall of this movie is slender man himself isn't scary anymore and the movie was made way too late.Now for the positives!!!!I liked 2 songs in the soundtrack(most of the songs in the soundtrack was basic horror movie soundtrackI like some of the more unique shots and camera movements (there were some though that were extremely jarring and dumb, additionally combined with some insanely weird editing choices that skip over entire parts of a scene, ex. One of the characters is crawling and then the next cut she's sitting down)Overall this is the absolute worst of horror movies and it's definitely disappointing considering the iconic character and the great uniqueness in horror genre over the past 5 years. Nothing is unique about this movie and even the basic stuff is made really bad.",

Consequently there's quite a bit in the trailer that didn't make it into the movie, resulting in some confusingly nonsensical scenes and characters. But the cinematography is pretty atmospheric, the acting's okay (I think it seems worse than it is sometimes because of the last minute hatchet-job), and although it's low-budget I think it had the potential to be a decent little scare-flick. There are actually some online hoping for a director's cut! Btw, Slender Man himself is played by Javier Botet, who played the title character ghost in Mama.",

However there were so many good points about this film that the fact it didn't live up to the title didn't matter so much . Go with low expectations and you'll enjoy this . Fortunately I had no idea of the back story or game so no preconceptions were going to ruin it for me . What stood out for me was SOUND - absolutely top notch and oscar winning potential - an absolutely essential ingredient for horror , PHOTOGRAPHY was exceptionally good throughout with many hirchockian tricks . ACTING all of the main protagonists acted extremely well in particular the character WREN . LIGHTING another essential element of horror - and finally DIRECTION - as a technical movie this was superb , it was only let down by the the key elements of script , story and sheer scare factor of the main character the monster ! Perhaps it was a metaphor for adolescence and the horror came from the cerebral conflict in the pursuit of female adulthood ? It was clearly influenced by the Ring but by trying to be real and believable rather than horror myth it kind of failed in its true potential - but it was TWICE as good as I expected it to be and I'm glad I saw it - I wasn't disappointed and neither will you be if you have low expectations.

            "content": "Let's start off by saying that the 3.2 score (which makes it one of the bottom 100 rated movies of IMDB) is by no means justified, it just isn't, at all. Having said that, it's not a perfect movie either.I don't know the Slender Man story other than it's a figure appearing in pics and videos. Can't say I know much more after this movie, which is one of the few downsides of this movie. There isn't much of a mystery, if there ever was any. There were interesting ideas, some of which came in the epilogue (and feels a bit like they needed to add some beef into the story afterwards), but in general this is more of an atmosphere flick.And the atmosphere is where this movie really shines in my opinion. It's well shot and the atmosphere is super creepy throughout. Music is good and there are some pretty interesting visual trickery that actually works. The slender man itself is not necessarily as scary as it might've been and would've probably benefited of \"keeping it more in the shadows\" so to say.The acting is ok, but the biggest gripe is that the story is really thin. It's kind of like a watered down version of The Ring, could've easily passed as a Ring sequel. Again, I don't know the relevance of watching the video in web stories this is based on, but here it's pretty much how it worked in Ring, you watch a video - weird things start to happen.So.. super good and strong atmosphere is enough to make it a winner in my books, but the story could've been better. Not necessarily everything makes sense here and I'm not sure if it needs to always either. There is practically no gore in this movie (another plus in my books).For what it's worth I thought The Nun was much worse and boring than this, watched both during the weekend. Maybe this is a bit of a slow burner, but I like my horror that way.",

The acting was so cringe it became harder and harder to watch as the film went on however I've seen these actors in other work and I'm going to have to blame it on direction and writing here. The Slender Man concept, although slightly outdated had so much potential but unfortunately was made into one big snooze fest. The major fault here was showing Slender Man, thus eliminating all suspense and having to rely on underwhelming jump scares and making the audience wait for some sort of twist that never comes. If this film was created the exact same but produced 10 years ago for a teen audience I think it would haver received a much better reception.If you're as excited or intrigued as I was about this film, watch it by all means but go into it with extremely low expectations so it is at least borderline bearable",

They are supposed to be teenagers, and they do look roughly the right age, but dear god the dialogue is just unbelievable. I'm convinced that it must have been written by a bunch of studio bosses that haven't interacted with the 'youth' in decades. It was only a year since I was a teen myself, and I can say that none of us ever speak like the caricatures in this movie. The very first thing they discuss is a YouTube cat video, commenting that it would be cuter if it exploded? Then one of them meows. Literally. The scene is so cringeworthy that it's been cut out of the extended previews online. The acting is atrocious but I hesitate to completely blame the actresses since the script is dire. They are all equally awful though, and the side characters are no better.So after the frankly bizarre cat video scene, the film properly opens with an equally inane conversation in a school hallway. Stilted dialogue highlights include, \"Super funny, like whoa\" (complete with gratuitous vocal fry of course) and \"The dudebros in their natural habitat, let's observe shall we?\". The girls awkwardly 'flirt' (I think) with some guys, only one of which will ever be seen again for an absolutely brilliant CGI moment which I'll get to later. The girls are going to hang out for the night, and just before that, Hallie's little sister sees Wren coming to the door. This is to set up a friendship there since Wren is going to introduce the sister to Slender Man later on, but they only interact once, and the tone of the scene seems more like the sister is in love with Wren, so it really doesn't pay off. So the four friends laugh and giggle, they watch a porn film (which we don't see or hear, thank god), they have a little chat, then out of absolutely nowhere, they search up Slender Man and watch a video to summon him. This is not the only Googling scene in the film, and it's reminiscent of Twilight, but worse. Chloe narrates a Google page about it for some super subtle exposition, literally telling us exactly what is going to happen next in the story. This is 5 minutes into the film, and we've just been told the entire plot. Wow.The 'summoning' video is an issue all on its own. So they play it, and we see some unusual, unsettling imagery that seems unrelated cut together. There's a blue tone over the shots. Some of it is related to a death later in the film. A creepy high pitched music plays over the scene. And best of all once they watch it, they're doomed by Slender Man. Yep, they tried to rip off The Ring. It's just not even close though. The tape scene in that film makes me feel properly uncomfortable like I've just watched something genuinely dangerous. The video scene in this film just makes me groan with cringe, and anger at the blatant copying. Not cool.So the film trundles on, Katie vanishes out of the film which is the catalyst for the rest of the 'story'. However, it has no impact on us since she has absolutely no development. All she has done in the film is chat about cat videos and watch a porno, so it's pretty hard to connect to or care about the character. After Katie disappears, her father breaks into Hallie's house, convinced that the friends are hiding her somewhere. He violently confronts her, and it feels as though he's being set up as a proper threat in the plot, since they have a scene showing his alcoholism too. But no. The next night, the girls break into his house instead to snoop in Katie's room for clues. One of them stays at the front door to distract him and they have a little 'emotional' chat. So is he an abusive bad father? Or is he a pitiful man who just lost his child? We don't find out, and he is never seen or mentioned again. Great.The 3 remaining girls enter the woods to confront Slender Man, and it doesn't work. But then it does, and Chloe breaks the magic circle and looks at Slender Man, which curses her? Or something? It's so darkly lit that it's nearly impossible to see what's happening. Which is a shame, since the only positive thing I can say about the film is that there is some nice cinematography, but sometimes that gets screwed up too. This leads to the point which I find the least funny, and the most frustrating out of all the problems. Chloe (for no discernible reason) opts to lie to her friends about her meeting Slender Man. Wren can tell something is wrong and keeps asking her about it, causing conflict between the friends as Chloe and Hallie think Wren is going mad. That's right, they shoehorn in a forced conflict just to create character drama in the most cliched way I can possibly imagine. Immediately after that happens you just wait for the girls to realise, 'Oh no! Wren was right all along, we should have listened to her!' There are multiple obvious cliches (to the point where you can predict all incoming story beats) but I think that one is the most irritating because the film can't even be bothered to provide us a good excuse for Chloe to lie about the whole situation.So after the pointless friend conflict, Chloe goes mad and strangles herself, it's not seen if she dies, but similarly to Katie and her father, she just vanishes out of the movie and is never mentioned again. I didn't even realise it till after the ending, I actually thought I must have missed a scene, but no. It's just that bad. Now we're down to 2 friends, and one of them, Wren goes to the library in a scene which I was almost ready to praise, for actually feeling similar to the game. She runs around the library corners in terror, and each time she turns, Slender Man is there. There's a shot of her face made blank like his too, which actually looked not bad. I thought, ok, that's fine, just keep it up, but not even 10 seconds later they ruin it. There's a very odd scene where the library corridor stretches till it just looks silly, and the effects are really not good. I am by no means an expert in the lore of the character, but I wasn't aware that he could warp space and time. To top it all off, they decide to attempt a jumpscare, which consists of putting a loud boom noise over a woman slowly walking through the library. In what universe is that a good scare?!So we inch closer to the end of the film. Hallie goes to see one of the boys from the opening scene to hang out, but she's starting to go a bit mad too. This leads to by far the funniest scene of the film. So they lie on the couch together, they kiss, then something happens... I don't know how they shot this but oh my god. His face is still while the background zooms in and out. Loud noises are screeching in the background, then his face glitches out, then it cuts again and his face twists into what I think was supposed to be like the expressions in The Ring, but again it just doesn't compare to what it's ripping off. It's hard to describe quite how ridiculous it looks but I was laughing almost hysterically when it happened. In fact I laughed out loud pretty often during the film which I know was not the intended reaction.We're almost at the ending now, but just before we get there, something odd happens. There is a short scene in a school classroom. Nothing happens, but there is an animal eye shown on the desk. Hmm, strange. This is because there was supposed to be an eye getting stabbed in this scene, which got cut out to try for the PG-13 rating. Instead we are left with 30 seconds of characters giving each other dramatic looks, and then a random eyeball, which should really have been left on the cutting room floor. I noticed another instance of this a few minutes later when Wren is about to jump out of a window to commit suicide. Hallie just stands and watches, but then all of a sudden pulls her away. Again, the scene got cut for the PG-13 rating, and it's stilted, disjointed, and obvious. No context is given for either of these scenes which really messes with the flow of the film and leaves the viewer baffled. Wren and Hallie have an angsty chat for a minute, then Wren is unceremoniously wrenched out of the window by Slender Man, and we don't actually get to see what happens to her. This is the 4th character that this happens to. There is no atmosphere and no tension, I actually didn't know that this was supposed to be the climax yet. All of a sudden Hallie goes to the woods, then she is made into a tree. Yep. That's the ending to the film. She just walks into the woods. Goes near a tree. Then the roots grow into her and she is now inside a tree. My husband and I just sat back, floored at what we had just watched. The cherry on top though, is an ending narration from Hallie's sister which is thematically irrelevant to the plot, over a shot of unrelated students walking down the school hall. (A setting which has only been used twice).Wow. I can't understand how a film could go so badly wrong. The pacing is jarring, probably due to the very short 1hr 30m running time which is just not enough to set up either the story, or any of the characters properly. Everything moves at a breakneck speed and scenes end without any warning which left me confused about what was important to the story and what was unimportant. Another huge problem is that it isn't scary in the slightest. There were so many cheap and pointless jumpscares that weren't clever or done well, By far the worst one though was a girl walking down the stairs and looking out the window. Nothing changes or moves in the scene but we hear a loud sound. Even though the sound was.Overall, I could go on for hours about how terrible this film was, but honestly I did enjoy how bad it was, so I give it one point back. I'd give it a 2/10.",

Don't get me wrong though I love this movie to watch for fun; I think Slenderman is really cool and they did a fair bit of showing him which I love. This movie just tried and failed at what it set out to be, but on the flip side it accomplishes being a cool tense thriller that's a tad scary at times. I highly recommend this movie; just don't go into it, expecting to scared out of your skin.",

Yes it is the movie is mainly dark and you will have some jumpscare moments really they did it good with it when ever it was there my body right away signaled my heart increasing the rates, characters did their job too, anyways theirs no need to under rate the movie i think it's under rated, highly recommended for Slender Man fans when ever you heard about it before, 6/10\u2b50",

It's debatable as to whether it's all just been done before and we are all conditioned now to the horrors and mundanity of everyday life as it is. I however, don't want to believe you just mature and grow out of horror films and stop being scared by them, I'd rather believe that a simple lack of talent and savvy behind most of the juvenile and it would appear, gay male directors in the field is attributed. The DVD special features to this film prove of more entertainment value that the actual film itself. The cool and attractive young cast talk about their intricate roles in this masterpiece of a film they're making, that they (posthumously?) believe is going to scare the **** out of everybody. Fat chance. Interestingly there is a couple of key scenes included that are shown being filmed in a natural light and you can see the 'potential' in it immediately. It's of course, too bad as usual that the filmmakers don't trust their instincts and basically cloak the whole movie in darkness, where blackness and canned sounds stand in for anything image wise. It gets pretty boring. The girls immediately summon the urban legend and make asses of themselves and are systematically removed from the picture. How or why we're not too sure of, nobody else exists or is in the picture, it's just a bunch of cutesy fools all flailing around in the typical supernatural vacuum. Minus scares.",

They summoned Slender Man from a website, by a link says \"SUMMON HIM\". I mean what kind of creatures can be summoned from a website?\n2. To \"summon him\", you must watch a video and follow the instructions in the video, and when you're done, congratulation, Slender Man is summoned, go and have fun with him!\n3. Slender Man is a good pranker! He made me laugh a lot with his pranks... What's dumber than making a pranker creature in a horror movie?4. Oh, yeah, the cast was dumber than Slender Man.5. Slender Man, please, grow up.. stop playing with the trees, it's noisy!!6. The CGI of Slender Man was like a man with some toilet paper rolled around his face.7. This message is for the developers of this \"game\", please, fix the glitch of the faces, and the horror-dreaming stuff.8. One more thing, please, fix the performances too, cause they are bad!9. The finale.. LOL!10. And now, the dumbest thing in the movie award goes to... The script! Congrats to the script, it was super-dumb!WOW, this movie is terribly bad! As I said, it was one of the most anticipated movies of the whole year, but it disappointed me very very much! It easily became one of the worst movies of 2018 -if it's not the worst already-!One more thing, why Katie's father thinks that \"people can not just disappear\"? Wake up, MR. There's something called kidnapping, didn't you hear about it?I think you already know what I'm gonna give this terrible movie, don't you?

This is yet another generic Hollywood-horror flick that we've seen hundreds of times. There's little salvaging this from being a complete dud. The approach they took with bringing Slender Man into the film was just terrible. Summoning him like some sort of demon but instead of using a Quija board it's a laptop.The tension in the film is so poorly built. Things just happen for the sake of them happening. This film isn't boring because nothing happens, it's boring because the same thing happens over and over again. It's rushed. Characters go missing early on with no development or build up. The 'scares and sequences' are as generic as possible. Running in the woods, twigs snapping, repeated jumpscares of just random people popping up with the cheap tense music the background. It gets repetitive. I found myself laughing out loud multiple times. Such as the scene where Slender Man videos calls one of the characters. Think about it. The supposedly scary monster video calling people? Come on. Also the hallucination scene when the lead character was kissing a guy at his house. Comedy gold.The dialogue is plain, and kinda cringe at times. The acting is pretty good. Joey King is going to be a big star someday i think. The effects aren't that good. Looks like they took them straight out of the video game. This film feels like a horror movie put together by people who've read summaries of great horror movies but never actually seen one. Although i have given this a lot of criticism, i don't believe this is one of the worst of it's genre like it's been rated to be. It's low effort, cheap, but watchable enough. At least i didn't fall asleep like my friend did.",

The only good thing about the movie was the music. Other than that the atmosphere was boring, cheap effects and weak jump scares that wouldn't even scare a child.There really is a LOT of missed opportunity here for a decent horror movie based on the Slenderman myth... but instead they just wasted their time and created a crappy film you should forget about and rather read some creepy pastas about Slenderman, since they will definitely get you more spooked than this.",

This leaves a film with artsy boring psychedelic-ish effects and bad sound effects. Not to mention the dreary script... I mean does anybody ever enter somebody else's house without turning on the lights? And what actually happened to the girls? Oh yeah it also mentions self mutilation but nothing ever happens.

I have played many slender games and i started this movie while i was thinking i am going to see a bad movie cuz of the reviews....People who rate this with 1 star i think they need to see more movies for sure.

The very first scene where the girls are on the bleachers, it was very terrible in the acting but it gets better. Some things that I wish had been different were\n* the lighting in the background. I wish slenderman had been more illuminated in the background so I could see him. The girls would see him and gasp and I hadn't even seen what was scary. This happened several times.\n* the CGI was a bit obvious also. It wasnt too distracting but the make out scene where his face was distorted. that was terrible lol I laughed at it as it was happening.\n* the plot was okay but I wish it would have said something about why their parents were letting these young girls out at night after a girl had just gone missing. I wouldn't let my kid out at night in these situations. And also the end was very abrupt. I wasnt expecting it to be ended so quickly and it was weird she said take me then ran away? Maybe she just got too scared but still was a disconnect there.\n* I wish the characters were a little bit more distinguishable. They didnt really have anything that stood out about them except the one girl was African American and the other was a ginger and one had a sister. That was how I kept track of them because I didn't really know which one was the main character.\nBut overall I think the movie did its job on being a horror movie. It had its unsettling scenes and creepy moments. I did enjoy it but it did leave me with questions at the end",

The girls were very believable.\nNo giant plot holes or people doing unrealistic things.Cons:\nDerivative work in some ways.\nDesign of the Slender Man could have been better.\nCGI was just bearable. Needed more budget.And a final note I'd give to horror directors, from a true fan. We like our supernatural critters to be discovered when people do things completely at odds with their normal behavior. It makes it plausible that the Big Bad could have been out there the whole time. I wish our introduction to the Slender Man could have happened a different, more intriguing way.And we like our critters with inhuman motives, things SO DIFFERENT from what we might consider motives, that we could never understand them. This movie does a good job with that, but others do not.I give it a 5 out of 10, with no markup to \"balance\" the low scores. 5 is a solid score for a horror movie on IMDB and this movie deserves that.",

If this was made in 2011 or 2012 when Slenderman was actually relevant I would imagine it would've been huge box office success, it'd still probably be bad but the hype would've helped carry and help with the succession. The writing, first and foremost was unforgivably cringey. In the first ten minutes there's pieces of dialogue that I've never heard any real people say, let alone a bunch of fifteen year olds. It lives into endless bad horror movie cliches with both the characters, dialogue and cheap jump scares but manages to savour some sort of dignity with the occasional scenic shot. I'm sure if this was a 12A young tweens would be terrified by this for the best part of a year but as a 15, for the people who were around for the Slenderman phenomenon who are mostly in their 20s now Will just this mundane, cringey and tiresome.

            "content": "I really don't know what to say. Acting was wooden and stilted as hell. \nOnly memorable parts of the soundtrack were the many sudden piano sounds and other clich\u00e9 (DUN!!!) jumspcare noises that played over everything. EVERYTHING. Even things that aren't scary (Example: There's a scene where a librarian walks past the screen and apprently it's supposed to scare you as evidenced by the sound cue, but the problem is: she's not doing or saying anything scary. She just walks past looking like she's lost. Like how was that scary????).\nThat's just about the only thing I can even recall as the story and dialogue were easily the most forgettable part of the whole movie. Actually, there almost IS NO STORY. All I remember is that 4 girls in high school summon Slenderman by going onto some forum or chat room and clicking on a link to a video that makes Slenderman come after you after watching it (which is already stupid on it's own, by the way. If that's all you had to do to get him to come get you, wouldn't the whole world be dead already?). After that, things just happen with no rhyme or reason and with no real consistency. Sometimes Slenderman decides to take victims immediately, sometimes he decides to let victims get away even when he has no reason to and the perfect opportunity to just take them. \nSlenderman himself looks like a poorly rendered Playstation 1 game model. They actually had an actor play as him? When??? He looks like he was built completely from scratch in CGI but done in like 2 minutes. Way too much CGI and way too lazily done!\nI'd also just like to point out that some of the best scenes from the trailer are NOWHERE in the movie. Like the eyeball stabbing or the guy throwing himself off the roof or the cops finding that pale girl in a field holding something in her hands. The most interesting parts of the trailer: completely cut from the film.\nOverall, I was really hoping for this to turn out good, but then again, this was made by Sony. So I really should have seen this coming the second it was first announced. If you're wiiling to basically turn your brain off for an hour and half and you're VERY easily scared, you might like this. But me? I'm gonna go re-play some of the awesome Slender games like The Eight Pages, Sanitorium, and The Arrival and just forget this ever existed. Leave it to Sony to make disappointing half-assed cash-ins on whatever is or was trendy. :(",

            "content": "This somewhat forgotten picture of 2018 amounts to a disappointment more than anything else. To address the obvious first: yes, this movie was made a few years too late, and sadly the quality of the finished film means it's likely that it will never be redeemed by gaining cult status by fans of either the horror genre or Victor Surge's eponymous character.There are maybe one or two frightening scenes that work well in the movie and it occasionally plays with suspense quite well for the first hour. Alas, as the film drag on the numerous fake-outs make the film a laborious bore and it's a struggle when it comes to the last half hour.You are waiting for the film to end once you've passed the sixty-minute mark, yet even when the film ends it's very unsatisfying. There's nothing wrong with the film's ninety-minute run time but there were far too many scenes cut from this movie (often integral ones revealing the fates of the characters we come across), so when the film ends seemingly out of nowhere it really feels as though you've missed something. You're just sat there left wondering, what was that all about? There's no resolution and therefore, no payoff so it feels as though you've wasted your time.Even watching the trailer back after finishing the film they feel like two very different products and that's a shame because this could have been so much more than what it ended up being. Especially when you consider Sony already had a ready-made story in their grasp as they could have easily adapted the 2014 'Slender Man' stabbing of Payton Leutner into something appealing. Nevertheless, what you're given is what is essentially an unfinished film, one I definitely would have felt cheated at paying to see in a movie theatre.Ultimately, Slender Man itself is an old internet creepypasta/meme from a by gone decade, which like this movie is best left forgotten. But, if you're someone out there looking to be entertained by this character (though I can't seriously believe there are many of you nearly a decade on), you're probably better off watching an old YouTube \"Let's Play.\"",

The point in slender man is that you barely see him or just glimpses. It wasn't scary at all, no jump scares either. You can tell it had been cut to pieces to get a lower age rating and in places it didn't make sense because of it. The acting wasn't too bad but the script was badly written also. It was so cliche in places you wanted to throw things at the tv and scream why would you do that it's 2018!! The pace was slow in places for a \"horror film\" and it just seemed so bland. It trails along from bad to good effects then bad again. Parts of it looked creepy to start of with then looked silly. It could of been so good. It's great source material and if someone like James Wan had the directors chair I think it could of been something special. However I struggled to finish it but did and didn't really care about any of the characters because to be honest parts of it just didn't make sense. A waste of a perfectly good premise. Avoid if you like decent horror. I would say try the Nun this year but that also was pretty poor considering it was a conjuring spin off.\nPlease someone try again and make a good movie of it.",

It presents an eerie atmosphere, as the majority of the scenes are shot at night with dark lit rooms, fog slowly creeping in the background, and ventures into the deep unforgiving woods that forces us to constantly scan the background for a shadowy figure. The acting is sufficient, I thought Julia Goldani Telles stood out and played this role quite well. With all of this going for Slender Man, its main downfall is that it lacks a fluid story that captivates its audiences. The pacing is erratic throughout the film, characters are so busy that I was never able to connect with any of them. Despite some nice visuals and tense moments, the main villain Slender Man also fails to be scary, he comes across as a generic boogeyman that we never really learn much about. Overall, I didn't think this was a bad horror film, it definitely has certain qualities about it that passes as watchable, but I feel like a much better movie is somewhere deep in those woods.",

Slenderman should not have had as much film time as he was given, if the film was made in a more atmospheric manner it potentially would have been better.

            "content": "From the director of Stomp The Yard (yes, you heard me right, the dance movie) comes Slender Man, based on a internet trend that died out years before this film came out. The basic premise is that a group of girls come across a online \"ritual\" to summon the titular creature. Then one of them goes missing. Now the remaining three have to dig deeper into the Slender-Lore to hopefully get their friend back. But why even bother caring? Why would anyone make this besides for the money? Slender Man is hardly scary. It actually feels a bit dumb. What really bothers me is that one of the actresses who plays a part of the main group, Jaz Sinclair, is WAY older irl then her character lets out to be. Proof? Slender Man came in 2018. Sinclair starred in another Screen Gems film, When The Bough Breaks, which came out in 2016. Her character in the latter was 21 years old. So assuming that was also her real age at the time, Jaz would have been 23 years old at the time of Slender Man's production. Wow. What a bad decision among the other ones this movie makes. If you want to watch it, go ahead. Just don't say i didn't warn you.",

Also, it doesn't play kitschy tropes from the dime-a-dozen horror flicks that come out each year.

I honestly don't know), everyone in the movie theater cheered. You won't be rooting for these insufferable kids, you'll be rooting for the villain. \nAre horror movies not allowed to have any blood anymore? There is not a single drop of the red stuff to be seen anywhere. No clear on-screen deaths either. The Slenderman gets sold as a creature that will screw up your mind more than it will actually cause any physical harm.\nThe special effects and creepy imagery are nice enough. Certainly well done.

Most of the plot involves characters doing the same things over and over again. Various \"scary\" set-ups are reused multiple times. Characters utter awkward, wooden lines at inappropriate times. Together, these constitute about 90% of the runtime.The remaining 10% of the movie is where things get funny. A few scenes, which are concentrated in the middle-to-late portions of the film, go completely off the rails. In one, a wildly underdeveloped character's face morphs into a caricature while speaking normally. In another, the staff of a hospital turn into automatons. People openly laughed in the theater.

I wanted to like this movie, and I wanted it to succeed. It did not. There is no passion, and no attempt to scare. Plot - the plot is weak and without imagination. Woah the kids saw a scary video and now the monster is going to get them! \nCharacters - par for the course in horror movies which is to say terrible. \nSound design - cliche to the point of nausea. \nPlease save your money and wait until you can see this for free.

With the girls encountering slender man one at a time & the eerie music that's supposedly building suspense , you can just tell when the jumpscares are coming. The only part I fairly enjoyed was the library scene, the camera work was intriguing. There were also some parts that were flat out confusing and had no correlation to actual plot but most likely added to keep the story going , which is fine, but they should at least explain it further on during the film. The ending made absolutely no sense it was poorly executed. Don't waste your money, everyone dies or goes mental and the dead ones get turned into trees, that's basically it.",

I turned off the lights, blasted the sound system and watched the movie alone and yet, I find myself falling asleep. Special effects aren't convincing. And yes, I strongly believe that horror doesn't need to rely on gore. Not at all. I was genuinely terrified by \"The Ring\" (Japan version). Thai movie \"Shutter\" sent chills down my back. \"Mirrors\" made me fear my own reflection for months and these movies relied not on gore but atmospheric tensions and the fear of the unknown to grip viewers in fear.

I was honestly surprised that the movie wasn't completely terrible. However, I can't say I recommend this movie to anyone. Things I liked:-Slenderman himself looked cool (except in the final scene)-Some background details were interesting (ex. Slenderman's shadow in the background)-The movie doesn't show Slenderman much-The movie makes good use of found footage in some scenes-Some memorable visuals-The movie builds tension wellThings I disliked:-The performances were extremely unconvincing -Too many pointless jumpscares that make no sense-The story felt like it was directly taken from other shows/movies (excluding the ending)-Several pointless scenes that add nothing to the story or characters-The movie takes itself too seriously-Toward the end of the movie, the main character's sister becomes severely ill and the movie expects the audience to care. However, this character has had only two scenes and has not been developed in any way up to this point-The ending is incredibly unsatisfying. I can't describe it without spoiling it.In the ending, Halle, the only one of the four girls still alive, goes into Slenderman's woods in order to sacrifice herself to save her sister. Once she finds Slenderman, she runs away and he grows massive spider legs and runs after her. She then gets wrapped in Slenderman's tendrils and becomes part of a tree. Halle's sister is no longer ill and then the movie ends. Overall, Slender Man isn't the worst movie I've ever seen. It has several very interesting and suspenseful scenes. However, it is held back from being anything memorable by a clich\u00e9 story, uninteresting characters, and an overly melodramatic tone. 4/10",

Story and charactersDumb teenage girls summon creature and get killed one by one. Okay so story isn't interesting at all, in fact it's one of the worst examples of uninspiring writing and story telling. Characters are really dumb and generic as well, with no personality to speak off. There is girl that dies first, token black girl, suspicious girl and girl that believes in legend.Cinematography, acting and soundTo it's defense there were some cool and good looking scenes, especially how some of the camera angles were utilized. But really it relied to much on the cheap stock footage effects and facial close ups. Effects were overall alright, but you can clearly see that budget was lacking to make it look good. Acting was horrendous, wooden and over-exaggerated, with some cringe worthy moments in between. Sound was well used and it did fit the scenes really well, but like some effects, they used way to much stock footage like sounds for moments, although they were well utilized.Enjoyment and verdictI really enjoyed this movie, for all it's lack of creativity and scary scenes, it made me realize that this isn't really a boring movie, rather a really generic one.

Goodness, this is a terrible movie. How it was not a straight-to-Netflix release is the most mysterious and scary thing about it. I forget the rating, but you can take little kids to it. It's not a frightening film at all.The plot, such that it is, involves five basic and very stupid teenage girls with impossibly basic names like Haley, Chloe, Wren, Leslie, and Katie. The girls possess about as much intelligence, courage, and resourcefulness as the Scooby Doo gang. Unfortunately for them, they also possess a link to a Slenderman video, which they watch during a camping trip. Or sleepover. It doesn't matter.Katie is the first to go, unless I've confused her with another character. Her absence bothers the remaining girls enough to finally sit down research Slender Man on the Google. They really struggle with the concept, but eventually come to understand that Slender Man is sighted by folks all over the world and is responsible for most missing children cases. You know, *that* Slender Man. The one from the Internet!What makes this an awesomely bad movie, rather than merely boring one, is how rudely Sylvain White treats his audience. I felt like I was being insulted by Donald Trump after sharing my \"belief\" that the human body isn't really like a battery. Some insults came in the form of overtly referencing other horror films like The Ring, Silent Hill, and even Hausu. (Who does that? Who includes Hausu references and expects their viewers no to laugh?) Other insults were verbal. Characters explained things I'd just seen or already understood because they were so easy to understand. Characters asked each other if they were okay when they obviously were not. The music and sound effects were equally insulting. Slender Man's bell sounded like it came from a cartoon. Slendy himself looked like he was wearing a tight-fitting sheet face mask he bought off Amazon.If you enjoy stupid horror films-and I do-this can make for an entertaining theatre experience.

Looking back it's obvious alot of film is on the cutting floor of the studio, take Tom for example, its stressed that he acted weird the day after but there's no follow up. The three boys in the beginning of the movie that were supposed to Summon SM but chickened out dissapeared after that scene never to be spoken of again. And the girl from the mental hospital? You'd expect a visit to her but no this is the climax already and now the movie's over and you didn't care enough about the characters or felt their connection to eachother. And Slenderman himself, they never properly explain to the audience what his 'thing' is (engulfing teenager girls in his special tree, but why), his powers, the \"he wants us\" comes out of the blue, he's shown way too much so that you become desensitived and cherry on top looks directly taken from the original Slenderman game, with the bad graphics and all.Go watch the Nun instead in the cinema's and wait for this to hit the internet",

However I watch a LOT of horror movies and this was scary enough that I felt that knot in my throat that said LOOK AWAY NO DON'T YOU WILL MISS IT BUT I'M SCARED BUT I WANT TO SEE IT. And the visual effects were subtle and quite interesting. If you pay attention there are lots of little visual tricks that support the SLENDER motif. And it doesn't really end...does it....",

            "content": "It wasn't boring, it was bad.The movie was entertaining where it needed to be. The problems are coming form actors and directing. It wasn't a brilliant plot. It was simple and cheap but nothing too bad. The flaw is how it is executed. Terrible acting to say the least. The actors were undoubtedly the worst part. Except for Annalise Basso (Cathy), most of the girls are terrible actresses mostly Joey King. Where the movie tries to be scary, just ends up being creepy. Like that scene, when a teenage girl looks at herself in the mirror, then becomes pregnant, then some kind of tentacles come out of her belly. I don't know if it was supposed to scare but all it did was a big WTF.The movie isn't complete trash. I have to admit that the visuals and the aesthetic of the movie are on point. The lightning, the cinematography, everything is beautiful and they did a really good job.\nI also liked the \u00ab disturbing \u00bb imagery. The summoning video Ring rip-off was actually very great. Also, Slenderman is almost full CGI but I think he was well executed and isn't too noticeable. He still looks better than the crooked man from Conjuring 2!\nThe music from the movie is also really great even if you hear it scream Game of Thrones. It is good but I would've liked Ramin Djawadi to explore something else.Before we end, I have two more flaw to point out. I saw a spoiler-free Youtube review before I watched the movie. The guy from the video (I can't recall his name so I can't credit him, sorry) said; \u00ab How do you think the movie ends? ... Yes exactly, that's how it ends \u00bb, and he was right. This is one of the most predictable ending ever but my problem isn't there. My problem is with the final narration from the sister of one of the girls. No one cares about her, the movie talked about her two times, and it ends as if she was an \u00ab hero \u00bb, she is the only survivor... the end... ???? ???????? Like they couldn't just end the movie with \u00ab They all die, he's unstoppable, the end \u00bb?? The felt necessary to add the sister telling what happenned? BUT in their defense, I think it's probable that they feared a lawsuit or something with their original ending, so they added this voiceover saying \u00ab slender man is bad. no summon him pls. \u00bb\nLast flaw here, this movie feels soooooo unoriginal. I felt like it copied so many things. Most of the scenes reminded me of other movies, which cannot be only an \u00ab hommage \u00bb. Here is a list of what I can recall;-Library chase scene: Obviously reminded me of It (2017)\n-Demon video thing: CLEARLY a copy of The Ring, even though some might call it an hommage\n-The weird camera effects (like zoom in and out at the same time): Look I know they don't own these but the Insidious movies really used these effects and I wouldn't be surprise they took it from there.\n-The hospital long hair lady: This is the craziest. I almost laughed out loud. How low do you have to be, to copy a concept from an American Horror Story teaser? Like not even the show, a t e a s e r!! The movie litterally steals an idea from a trailer for Season 6 (Roanoke)\n-Hospital hallway man: Reminded me of It Follows\n-The \u00ab sex scene \u00bb: this one is a little pushed I'll admit but it reminded me of Truth or Dare.Overall, if you expect to see an awful movie (like I did), you will end up having an OK experience with an average horror movie.",

It's obvious to anybody who has visited online horror forums before that nothing good is gonna come out of a major motion picture based in an internet creepypasta. The source material is not elaborate or cohesive enough to justify making a full-length film about it, unless the writers are able to expand on it and fix it, which is not the case here.Since there's so little backstory behind this creature, the plot is very straightforward and a little uneventful. Four friends decide to summon the entity known as Slender Man out of boredom during a sleepover. At first, they don't take the consequences of their actions seriously, until, after a while, one of them disappears. Not much else happens. However, part of the narrative feels disconnected from the bigger scheme, because some minor events are left without resolution.The characters are basically non-existent, with only slight hints of what could pass as a personality for each one. The consequence is the audience's complete indifference to what will happen to them, limiting the interest in watching this film to an occasional jump scare or possible gory outcome to a particular scene. The actors do what they can with the material they're given, but the result is mediocre at best.The awful CGI is distracting, though there's not a lot more they could have done here. The biggest problem is the concept behind the story, too broad to be scary. It negatively affects the cinematography that follows the same generic path. There is one or two interesting images that would form nice compositions if they were part of a collage in an art exhibit, but here they're just not very special.If anything, the biggest flaw in this film is taking itself too seriously. It misses the opportunity to have fun with its own stupidity, and prevents the audience to do the same. Therefore, there is no reason to watch it. Skip it.",

It wasn't ALL bad, it was nice to see it go back to the original story, by having Slenderman hunt after vulnerable children, and the acting wasn't awful. Hell, even Slenderman itself didn't look too bad, but dear god I was disappointed.The characters were flat and disappointing, with little to no development throughout the movie. The dialogue was ridiculous, with its feeble attempt at connecting to other Slenderman horror series through the \"It's like a computer virus but the computer hardware is your brain\" line. Especially when the virus connection has been made before, but through the physical sickness way. It would've been perfectly fine to reference MLAndersen0 or Marble Hornets by calling it a sickness or something like that. Some of the way the scenes were filmed made me think they had a GoPro attached to a selfie stick on their stomachs.I'm mostly upset with how Slenderman was portrayed, as it is the main villain and focus of this movie. Its appearance was fine, it looked nice, whatever. But... why was it crunchy? When its tendrils would move, there were crunching and cracking sounds. The way it was \"summoned\" into the movie was pathetic, a video? Really? Who's idea was it to make Slenderman walk? It ruined the horror factor of it, because it just looked downright silly. To quote my friend's opinion on that, he said, \"Slenderman has effeminate hips.\" Also, why did it clip through the houses like this is a poorly rendered G-Mod map? Why did it video call the main characters? Why, why why?!To close this off, I want to mention a line that was downright insensitive. In the end scene, the younger girl says, \"Messed up people doing messed up things, to make more stories to talk about\" which is a very obvious connection to the stabbings that happened a long while ago. Which is... pretty yikes, to say the least. Why do people keep on bringing it up? Do you really want that poor girl to relive her trauma?",

Yes a lot of movies had a bad ending or they didn't have good effects but the plot was great and it can be the other way around, but Slender Man didn't have good effects or a good ending it was just really bad. Slender man is a trashy movie because it has weak character development and a muddled plot.When the movie first started they didn't really give any specific information about the character Slender Man. As the movie started to come along they only gave a couple of details about Slender Man. I didn't really like that because if I didn't know who he was and went to go watch the movie I would be confused about who Slender Man is, I wouldn't understand what Slender Man would do. Leaving character development out is a big thing because you wouldn't understand what was going on. It makes the movie worse because you won't get the concept of the movie or the character because you don't understand.The plot made it a bad movie too. The plot was muddled. At first, everything was fine until all the girls had a sleepover and they were face timing some boys from there school, When the boys dared them to go on the dark web and watch some video. First of all, you shouldn't go on the dark web and watch some random video and second, you shouldn't be talking to boys late at night. So after they watch the video of a glitching screen they all went to bed. The next day one of the girls go missing; this is where everything just gets so confusing and stupid. All of a sudden all the girls start to feel something weird happen to them. Then the scenes just start to change to them hiding them running in the woods then hiding and holding things in the middle of the woods walking in the street at night, then more people go missing. To me this movie was very confusing it was pointless, like why are girls running in the woods in the middle of the night? Why are they walking in the middle of the road at night? Why are they walking in a cemetery? Why didn't you inform someone instead of gathering your friends to go sit in the middle of the woods to see if Slender Man comes? It just doesn't make sense to do all that extra stuff that doesn't even connect with half the movie.I do not recommend this movie to anyone. This movie overall was awful, it just didn't make sense, the movie was all over the place. For me personally, it bored the crap out of me my cousin fell asleep my mom and my sister left to go to the store, and at some point of the movie this random lady got a phone call and her conversation was even more interesting than the movie.",

Dialogue felt forced and was difficult to listen to without a few cringes, cinematography was bland and overdone in all but one portion which lasts for almost a minute, and the general story was not good. Generally movies based on something has a clear picture of source material, and a movie like this had so much source material to work with. Multiple games, a youtube channel with enough content for multiple hours (which is something I would have appreciated seeing become the movie adaptation, so take this with a grain of salt if you will) and stories upon stories on wikis and creepypasta. None of these sources seem to have been referenced, as any ideas lifted aren't explored as much as touched upon. The villian has many powers, most of them only shown once, sometimes twice, making it feel super underwhelming. The movie drags on with various plotlines that hold no relevance, and are uninteresting and by the end the last few scenes feel rushed. Not a very good movie in the slightest.",

            "content": "I was familiar with the slenderman character before going to this movie. He is a creepypasta that I especially enjoy but I am also not completely informed of his origins. Going into this movie I didn't know what to expect but I knew it wouldn't be like the videogames.The concept behind the movie was very full of potential. A group of girls go online and they watch a video about slenderman. This causes them to have adverse side effects which they later discover to be slenderman. One friend goes missing and the rest have their lives flipped upside down. Overall, a good start. Nothing particularly unique but it had my attention. However, the movie starts to fall apart about halfway through. There are elements introduced that have absolutely no payoff (ex: the book that Wren finds at the library). They introduce the idea that they can get their friend back from slenderman which presents the idea that they could go on to defeat him but in the end this scene just serves as a way for their friend Chloe to be subdued by slendy. However Chloe's \"illness\" is barely touched on afterwards. What happens to her? Will essentially she just be a zombie? Then the end of the movie was just disappointing. Hallie goes into the woods to sacrifice herself in order to save her sister. She gives herself up to slendy and is absorbed into the slendertree. So she's a tree now. Is that what happened to Katie? Is Katie a tree now? Just seems a little lackluster to me.Overall, the movie is alright. I enjoyed the first half the most. The end just seems to lose direction. I would've enjoyed to see the girls defeat slenderman and get Katie back somehow or at least have them try to hold their own and have the audience watch and slendy overcomes and eventually takes them. I understand that bringing a creepypasta/video game into the cinematic world can be difficult but there just seemed to be no direction at all at the end which is disappointing considering how much could have been done with the character of slenderman.",

For people who don't know what the slenderman is, it may not be as dissapointing, but I always enjoyed the creepypasta story of him online. The mystery behind it is mainly what makes slenderman cool to me, but this movie just added unanswered questions. For instance, they used very stereotypical characters, who had unrealistic reactions to life or death situations at times. I'm not blaming the actors, but the way the film was planned out.I could go on for a while on this topic, but if you are interested in creepypastas like the slenderman I recommend a series called Marble Hornets. Unlike the slenderman movie, this one is a zero budget series found on youtube called an ARG. It may sound cheap, but I think the actors did a great job, and it had a better story than this movie. Essentially, I found it more interesting and there were parts that were more chilling in their own ways. (Again, this is just my opinion, Marble Hornets is not for everyone)I hope this helped :), also I apologize for grammar mistakes, english is not my first language!",

There was this one scene where this girl is like \"take me take me\" to slender man and when he comes for her she starts running like how illogical and stupid is that, probably the funniest part of the movie. The ending was so bad it was one of those where you think there's more to it and then it kinda just ends like okay. There's also some scenes that were showed in the trailer but not in the actual movie.

What did movie did right, in my opinion, was that it showed Slender Man in all of his shapes and also that he in a way uses the internet to get to people. That made it interesting. I also liked the way he distorted the realities of the people he was infecting. A weakness of the film was that the characters didn't really get a personality. The girls would all be interchangeable I guess. I also didn't like how few screen time Slender Man actually had, and that it never becomes clear what happens to the children he takes.

In fact, Slenderman is Nosferatu, be it in a new design.As for where the movie fails; there is not enough story to go around and it leaves the main characters (four teenage-girls) rather underdeveloped. Yet at the same time, thank God, not as dumb blonds stalked by a hockey-mask wearing psycho. Instead, this is a somber, surreal piece of work, with no dead bodies or any blood on screen. This isn't a movie where characters fear what they see; They fear what might be coming and it's chillingly effective. In fact, things are shown so ambiguous, suspense wise, one questions if it is happening for real or just in the minds of the characters. If this movie works it's because of the idea that events might just have been a bad dream. A nightmare.And nightmares are the scariest films of all.Verdict; An ambitious attempt at innovative horror but the story slipped somewhat under the radar. Rating; 6.",

I shouldn't have felt the annoyance the pressure just to get this movie done with. This movie had sound that was actually quite a headache because when something creepy was about to happen, it went from deep sound to really high pitched noises that kept on getting louder and louder which did was not Slender man at all, we shouldn't have expected a haunting to happen at all it should be dead silent, completely normal and then Bam!

His metrology could be compared to Pennywise the Clown from IT, but with much less flare. \nThere is also a big theme of hopelessness throughout the film.  They didn't meet with a scientist (which is odd because they found their book) to find a way out.

For example, during one of the scenes in the bedroom, you see Slenderman's shadow emerge behind them. How scary!\nFurthermore, it is a very progressive film, as I thought all of the main characters were all diversified and well written. In addition to that, the main protagonists were all female, which should be a good standard for films to come. This is a good contrast to the new Ghostbusters film, which was criticised for having an all female cast, as the cost of good writing. This film delivers both; a good diverse cast and good detailed writing. \nVery good film and would recommend to anyone who is wanting to get into the genre! \nGood tidings and viewings!\nConor, L., (2021).",

Seriously, Imagine if you had your own movie and you only had 5 minutes of Screentime.\n\n-The Characters: \nThey were flat like paper, Who would want to watch a horror film where some group of teenagers scream every 5 damn seconds? And due to them summoning Slender Man for some reason, their dumbass actions get themselves disappearing one by one.\n\n-The Ending: \nOkay... What? So Basically this film ends with one of the characters getting teleported to the forest where the Slender Man is located, she encounters and gets chased by Slender Man, The character gets turned into a tree just to save her sister, and then the sister talks about how the slender sickness spreads or something and then the film ends. Like.. what?\n\n-The PG-13 rating: \nThis rating really bothers me, I don't remember Slender Man being a PG-13 Character... And this was probably the reason a fuckton of scenes were cut.\n\n-False Advertising:\nLots and lots of scenes from the trailers ended up getting cut. hell, even a character named \"Allison\" ended up being cut,\n\nAt the end of the day, This Movie is pretty \"meh\" that really could've been better and I wouldn't recommend it.",

It's 4-5 shallow, empty characters with just enough flavor to tell them apart, and I just can't care about them.\n\nThe movie focuses on the subtly of it all, the growing madness that Slender Man instills in his victims without properly building the tension or showing the characters slowly losing it, which would have given good actors the ability to save it.  Instead they use a lot of \"it happened offscreen\" or sudden cuts to show a lose of time, and we get a character suddenly looking confused instead of taking the audience on a journey with the character.\n\nMaybe it's not the writing, and maybe the editor just didn't know what they were doing?  \"What are all these long dramatic series in here?

The horror is made in a very very cheap way with imagery that isn't scary, jumpscares that won't scare you and bad special effects.\nThe Pacing is so slow and altogether the movie is very boring. There are many things that do not make any sense and I would have also wanted to see more about the real life stories like the two girls who sacrificed a friend because they believed in slender man. Another big thing that comes to mind is the way the sequences are filmed. Every scene is shot in such a choppy way.\n\nAltogether Slender Man just bored the sh*t out of me and it didn\u2018t scare me either.\nBUT, if you wanna get drunk with a bunch of your friends I see that you could find some enjoyment in this movie. Otherwise I don't recommend it at all.\nI can't give this movie an honest rating by the way because there's now 0/5 on Rotten Tomatoes. LOL",

What Slender Man should have done is been one of those films that plays on technological fears and senses of paranoia, and used it's scares with subtlety.  There's a new brand of horror a lot of films do now where there will just be something in the background, and they won't dwell on it, it'll just be there.  Maybe you'll see it, maybe you won't, and that's what's creepy about it.  That's perfect for Slender Man, that's really what was creepy about him in those original images that made him popular in the first place.  And at times, this movie almost does that.  The weird thing is there are glimpses of what could be a good movie in here, like the director knew what made Slender Man scary but then the studio said \"no, more jumps scares, more Sony product placement\", and now here we are, just another cheap teen horror movie like every teen horror movie.  Literally this is just another teen horror movie, it's got all the ingredients of one: over the top acting, jumbled editing, big CGI jump scares, Joey King screaming at things, all the ingredients.  It's so frustrating because Slender Man is one of our modern monsters and he is a good one and he can be so scary, but this movie doesn't know what makes him scary.

This movie isn't the so-bad-it's-good kind; it's very much the opposite. I wasn't entertained at all. The best thing this movie had was the titular antagonist, the internet phenomenon that is Slender Man. Even years after it stopped being relevant it still posessed a certain creepiness factor. And yet he was heavily underutilised, appearing in the flesh in only a couple of scenes. He mostly infulences the protagonists psychologically through dream sequences or some hallucionatinons but rarely do we see him actually doing something. It's merely implied and that is a big misstep. The movie is also filled with sequences that obviously lead to a jumpscare of some kind and there one can see the lack of creativity behind the scenes. The actors don't do the film any favors as well. They try their best, in particular Joey King, with the script they are given but it doesn't seem to work. The characters just aren't compelling at all. That along with the very incoherent plot make the film almost unwatchable. For the first, say, 15 minutes I was actually thinking that it wasn't that bad but after the first girl that disappears everything just goes downhill. I'd say there are a few solid creepy scenes in the film that showcase what it potentially could have been but it just seems incompetent at what it's trying to do in this final form.

In one forest scene, I was watching a black screen and being blinded by the flashlight moving across the camera every couple of seconds.

Maybe someday,  someone with balls and talent, can produce a film that plays into the themes of technology, internet, and cult following.

Also, it somehow fails to meet even the criteria of a film genre that has already relegated itself to lower than substandard expectations. Month by month we see shitty jump-scare horrors all as indistinguishable from one to the next, promising some transient thrills with boring, boring, BANG dynamics. Yet it not only fails to tell a compelling story in any regard to its ill-timed and criminally (literally) insensitive boogieman, but it also fails to deliver in the already lazy formula it is reliant upon. It's an utter waste of scream queen Annalise Basso who goes missing within the first 15 minutes despite her being the actress with the most credentials. Joey King of The Kissing Booth takes center stage and does her best (which isn't all that great) with the anachronistic dialogue written by a 50 year old man trying his best to capture the spirit of high school aged girls.",

It takes them weeks for them to find out that the oh-so-scary slender man got her.\n\nThe story was stale. Why do you decide to take the point of view of a few high school girls? Why not something a LITTLE more interesting? Like a parent investigating their high schooler\u00e2(TM)s disappearance?\n\nThe CGI...sweet Jesus...Sony, it is 2018...\n\nThe actual movie is dark. No, I mean, literally dark. If the lights are turned off in a room, or if it is nighttime in the woods, you can barely make out anything that you are seeing, unless you watch an edited version of the film, which I seriously doubt someone would waste their time editing this hollow catastrophe - if you deleted the bad scenes in this movie, and only leaves the good ones, we would have the very first film that only featured end credits, only we would not, since there would not be a movie in that case, WHICH IS WHAT WE REALLY NEED!!!!\n\nSome things are just...STUPID! Like when they going LOOKING for slender man (STUPID YOU WANNA DIE FOOLS?), and they have to sacrifice something they love (-_-) for him to spare their lives. They bring blindfolds so they do not accidentally look him in the eye (no - face? No, wait, he does not have a face either...). They put on the blindfolds, AND SECONDS AFTER, ONE OF THE GIRLS TAKES OFF THEIR BLINDFOLD WTF WHY IN THE NAME OF JESUS CHRIST WOULD YOU TAKE OFF THE BLINDFOLD WHAT COULD YOU POSSIBLY GAIN FROM TAKING OFF THE BLINDFOLD INSANITY THATS WHAT YOU THICC ;) INDIVIDUAL!!!\n\nWas there anything good about this movie? Yeah, the cinematography - the camera position are good and creepy. But that is IT. NOTHING ELSE.\n\n0% fresh. I would guzzle gasoline then inhale a Zippo before I watch this dull, dull movie ever again. It is so bad up to the point that it actually feels unfinished, but maybe it is not.

The acting is sufficient, I thought Julia Goldani Telles stood out and played this role quite well. With all of this going for Slender Man, its main downfall is that it lacks a fluid story that captivates its audiences. The pacing is erratic throughout the film, characters are so busy that I was never able to connect with any of them. Despite some nice visuals and tense moments, the main villain Slender Man also fails to be scary, he comes across as a generic boogeyman that we never really learn much about.

They do a Google search for Slender Man, summon him like fools, and now they have to try to survive.  Now I do actually do like the lore of Slender Man... to an extent.  In a sense, it is the internet's version of a campfire story.  I think it's a fun to look for him in the background of pictures online, and I do enjoy playing the video games, as simple as they may be.  That said, I can sniff out a turkey pretty far in advance, and there was no real reason for this movie to be put into existence.  The mystique is largely what makes this character as effective as he is, so why are they making a narrative focused on learning more about him?  This was about as terrible as I was expecting, and may God help you if you were excited for this.  Right out of the gates, this starts off on the wrong foot with these girls.  They don't talk like natural people, they talk more like how adults think teens talk, and it is awkward.  It is not helped by the fact that these girls aren't the best of actors, which is hindered even further because nobody in this makes logical choices.  Not to get into spoiler territory (I just know there are people out there that don't want Slender Man spoiled for them), but there are way too many points where you will audibly talk to the screen, asking hard-hitting questions like: \"why don't you go to the cops?\" or, \"why don't you talk to an adult?\"  This is a folly of many a horror movie but here, it is considerably worse because it is so noticeable.  To further exacerbate things, in the smack dab middle of when these girls are dealing with Slender Man, they take a break to bicker about boys.  Why?  Because this is written by somebody who does not have a clear understanding of how sensible human beings operate.  I don't think that this is the worst thing in the world, it is just a very poorly conceived horror flick.  It is basic, and when this thing is finally wrapping up, there are way too many dream sequences for you to even start being scared.  They make up the rules as they go along, so much so that the rules in this universe aren't clearly defined enough so that you feel threatened.  It gets tedious with the amount of research they do on computers, and there is even bad lighting to boot.  Yeah, this is a big time waste of your time.",

A tall, faceless, and long arms mysterious being does sound creepy when it is lurking in the forests, stalking people. The film fails to even being a scary movie. It has everything that fails in its clich\u00e9 of horror movies. Stupid teens, boring direction that lacks scares and consistent scenes. Lets not forget the plot does feel more like a rip off from The Ring movies. The characters are all bad and lacking in characteristics that you would root for. These teens made the stupid decision to watch a video of a slender man on a website. From there, Slender man is stalking these teens one by one. Luring them into the forest or traumatizing them to the part they go insane. Teens make the stupid decision and it is difficult to even care for them. Also, if it is a plot hole or something. But where are all there parents. They go walking around their homes on a school night, yelling and screaming cause something is coming inside their homes. And no adult supervision is found. Until, one of the kids ends up in a hospital and the parents finally show up out of nowhere. The direction is lacking comprehensive with its storytelling. Characters go missing when one of the girls is trying to reach her boyfriend. You really do not hear back about what happened to him. The acting is dull. Joey King, Julia Goldani Telles, Jaz Sinclair, and Annalise Basso were all tedious with their performance. The script also was lacking in characteristics with their characters. Which made it hard for you to even care for them. The plot was similar to The Ring. Except, they are being stalked by a mysterious tall, skinny, faceless man. It does have some creepy moments. But it fails with its clich\u00e9 horror storytelling. And the climax and third act gets lazy with its storytelling. That is not even sure how to end the film. With one character going insane in the hospital and decides to face the slender man herself. Overall, Slender Man is a bad film. It lacks scares and suspense. Characters make stupid decisions. Acting is boring. The direction is lazy and the script lacks in fleshing out their characters. Only good thing is Slender Man is kind of creepy.",

My problem is the deleted scenes. I watched as the eye stab from the trailer didn't happen, as the girls just suddenly had the laptop, and we were all left qondering what would happen to that boy. It left me with a bittersweet feeling at the end, because while I did enjoy the movie for what it was, there were obvious pieces in it missing that I was left to fill. And all because they said they didn't qant to be offensive. Which I don't think they even achieved. In my eyes there is no way to not make this movie and not have it be offensive, honestly. So, you either make the movie or don't. Unless they decide to ever release a directors' cut ( which I think we all know is very unlikely), then I guess I'll be left with the bittersweet feeling of a good movie that's only partly done...",

The movie was way to involved with the four main characters, whom all of them in that group had a very bland personality traits where the movie instantly began to become lackluster with the obvious small town suburban like characteristics, which quite had me disinterested in the story of this film. \n\nIn my opinion, Slender Man should obviously be the main attraction and this film missed a big opportunity in using the poise and feminized strutting catwalk that Slender Man does when chasing it's victims. Pretty much Slender Man is like a haunted or devilish runway model or influenced fashion queen that stutters the runway with purpose chasing after you, showcasing a kind of Mike Myers and Freddy Krueger type way of horror.",

I enjoyed playing the game and listening to these urban legends about him, but this movie was.. EH!!!!\nJust to know, this review is gonna be a funny review actually.\n\nSlender Man is directed by Sylvain White, written by David Birke and starring Joey King, Julia Goldani Telles and Jaz Sinclair.\n\nThe story is about a group of girls summoning Slender Man and when he got summoned, one of them gets missing, and the others trying to run away from him.. this is the whole story!\n\nNow, that's what I call a horror-pranks film, it's full of unscary scenes, with Slender Man pranking these girls.. or poor girls.. how did you talk all these pranks from a man without a face?\n\nFirst of all, let's count the dumb choices in this movie...\n1. They summoned Slender Man from a website, by a link says \"SUMMON HIM\". I mean what kind of creatures can be summoned from a website?\n2. To \"summon him\", you must watch a video and follow the instructions in the video, and when you're done, congratulation, Slender Man is summoned, go and have fun with him!\n3. Slender Man is a good pranker! He made me laugh a lot with his pranks... What's dumber than making a pranker creature in a horror movie?\n\n4. Oh, yeah, the cast was dumber than Slender Man.\n\n5. Slender Man, please, grow up.. stop playing with the trees, it's noisy!!\n\n6. The CGI of Slender Man was like a man with some toilet paper rolled around his face.\n\n7. This message is for the developers of this \"game\", please, fix the glitch of the faces, and the horror-dreaming stuff.\n\n8. One more thing, please, fix the performances too, cause they are bad!\n\n9. The finale.. LOL!\n\n10. And now, the dumbest thing in the movie award goes to... The script! Congrats to the script, it was super-dumb!\n\nWOW, this movie is terribly bad! As I said, it was one of the most anticipated movies of the whole year, but it disappointed me very very much! It easily became one of the worst movies of 2018 -if it's not the worst already-!\n\nOne more thing, why Katie's father thinks that \"people can not just disappear\"? Wake up, MR. There's something called kidnapping, didn't you hear about it?\n\nI think you already know what I'm gonna give this terrible movie, don't you? Yup, it's definitely an F!!\n\nOkay, guys, thank you as always for reading my review, let me know if you like my reviews or not, and I welcome all the comments.",

When Hallie is portrayed as a fast athlete we have no given  proof if she really is because we never see Hallie run around the track; in fact, she slips while she runs away from Slender Man near the end. Hallie decides to give herself to Slender Man to save her sister Lizzie but runs away regardless. Slender Man NEVER RETURNS a captured soul, he ether kills them or given the Slender Sickness which will kill off the victim and he doesn't turn humans into trees! \n\nDo I really have to point out all other flaws? Not worth it. This movie insults Creepypasta fans and is EXTREMELY late of Slender Man's popularity.",

Sadly, though, this movie was not banned and it still even remains in theatres today. \nThis movie would've been watchable in 2012, however in 2018, its lack of substance, or anything that makes it scary, is just bad, and we as an audience would no longer just enjoy the movie because of the character that we all knew and loved back then. \nThe actual slender Man has like arthritis for some reason and so every time he movies it makes this popping sound, it doesn't come off as unsettling, it comes off as \"oh, I would immediately know the location of slender man if he was anywhere near me because he pops like a god-damned chiropractor's office.\" \nSlenderman also has a fetish for trees. I realize that because of Slender: The Eight Pages, the forest has become a big part of the Slenderman lore, and so it's understandable that bits of the movie would take place in the forest, but literally I get the feeling that if this movie was rated NC-17, we would end up with tree tentacle porn.\nThis movie is retarded, and if you watch it, watch it to laugh at it, don't think that it's actually going to be good.",

        {
            "content": "So to put my experience with this movie in context: I have a long history with the Slender Man mythos. I came across some of the Marble Hornets videos back in 2010 or 2011, before the game came out and the character became sort of a meme, and I became obsessed. I poured through every webseries and blog I could find. Searched for forum threads of photoshops and did research on similar historical iconography. I even made my own short film on the subject. The community that was built around this monster was truly fascinating. An instantly recognizable monster whose stories were being built by a disorganized group of horror fans and amateur writers and filmmakers spread out across the internet. It was rapidly evolving modern folklore, and it was really cool to watch. Nearly the whole community seemed to understand what made Slender Man scary, and if they added context or back story, it would always be small and it would always raise more questions. The less you know about him the better. There were no solid rules. Just various accounts of stalking and death. Going back, a lot of this writing is fairly mediocre outside of the bubble of that passionate bunch of people, though some of the stuff still really holds up. One of my prized possessions is the complete series of Marble Hornets on DVD signed by the guys who made it. So with all that being said, I am going to address this film in two different ways: firstly as a film fan, and then as a Slender Man fan.\n\nThis is a very bad movie. Just atrocious. Wow. Do not watch it. Damn the writing is just so godawful. This is a movie about a bunch of teenage girls that was written by a middle-aged man and it is painful to watch. They spout weird dad jokes, and the flow of their conversations is so stilted and weird. They talk about leaving town in only the most generic, general ways. When Slender Man gets brought up, of course one of them has never heard of it, and the rest must explain it to her and the audience. They're all incredibly stupid. There's a scene where they all just have to sit still and wear blindfolds, and because the writing is trite garbage, one of them moronically lifts her blindfold and looks straight at the monster. Dumb. The drunken father of one of the girls breaks into his daughter's friend's house and attacks a couple of children and then is back in his home no problems the next day. Ridiculous. The whole set up and plot is basically a straight rip-off of The Ring. They watch a video, and then they are cursed to be killed by a monster. Plot threads are picked up and dropped almost instantly. There's a very pointed line about one girl having a bunch of trophies, and it's spoken with resentment. It sounds like a line you're supposed to remember but this almost conflict is never brought up again. There is a person feeding them information through the internet whose identity is called into question several times that stops being relevant halfway through the movie and they never address them again. The editing is choppy and the dream sequences are generic. The effects are inconsistent, sometimes they're creepy but usually they're in your face and looking awful. The sound design is full of odd choices. There is a sequence where she hears something downstairs and you hear metal clanking to the floor. This is later revealed to not be the monster, but I couldn't help but imagine Slender Man sneaking through the kitchen and accidentally knocking a pot off a shelf and it made me laugh in the middle of a scene that was supposed to be tense. Some of the cinematography was okay. The actors were alright, they probably would have been good if they had anything to work with, the cast really deserved better.\n\nAnd as a Slender Man fan? What a mess. The writer and the director obviously have no concept of what makes this monster scary. Watching Slender Man videos trains you to watch the background for him. One of the scariest things about the character is seeing him when the protagonist doesn't. In Marble Hornets, the characters would become paranoid about doing things they don't remember and would film themselves when they sleep. Leading to recordings of Slender Man watching them while they lay unconscious. Characters would walk through the woods and you would catch a glimpse of him in the background. It increases the paranoia. He's always watching. In this movie the only time you see Slender Man is when the characters do. It's so blunt force about it. Wouldn't want the audience to miss him. Got to have him front and center. Wouldn't want to leave anything for someone to notice on a second viewing. Well, that's not fair really. I suppose there is one time where we see him and the girls don't; when his shadow sneaks into their room like he's fucking Peter Pan. It looks so stupid, and it's not even consistent with how he normally works. As someone who obsessively researched the Slender lore and got so freaked out by the videos that I would see him out of the corner of my eye next to trees and street poles, I can tell you that just finding the videos is enough to get someone hooked. That's what the community means when they say that he spreads like a virus. You find out about him and you go deeper and deeper and then you share your story and he spreads. Like a disease. The writer of this movie read the virus thing and instead decided to make it that Slender Man is \"a computer virus but for your brain.\" Stupid. Nonsensical. So I suppose he did do some research, they showed a couple of the original Victor Surge images. They have the woodcarving of the skeleton. There's a brief mention of shadow people. But they obviously didn't do much more digging than that. And then there's the videos. They decided to rip off The Ring and make it so that instead of someone just becoming consumed by thoughts of Slender Man after finding videos or blog posts, there's a whole video-based summoning ritual that people do at parties. Sort of a modern Bloody Mary. Then well after that they find all of the drawings that are usually indicative of someone completely corrupted by Slender Man, a \"proxy\" as most people call it. But that doesn't actually make much sense for the character at that point, so it feels more like an element they knew they had to include but didn't know where to include it. All the videos they watch are strangely highly edited, with a whole lot of cuts and music playing over them and circles edited in to point out ol' Slendy, once again they have to point him out every time he's there because subtlety is impossible for this movie and it doesn't trust its audience to pay attention. And all these videos are posted on some deep web site. Why though? There's no violent content. Why are they not on a YouTube style website? You know, like they are in real life? And to cap it all off. Ever wonder what happens to Slender Man's victims after he takes them? Want to know what happens to these mysterious disappearing people? HE TURNS INTO A TREE AND THEN ABSORBS THEM INTO HIS TRUNK I GUESS.\n\nOKAY. SURE. WHY NOT? FUCK IT.\n\nIt's just such a waste of a good monster. Slender Man can be terrifying, Marble Hornets frightened me more than any other horror media back when I first found it. But this movie is not remotely scary. Slender Man can be fascinating, finding all the little clues strewn about writing by dozens of different creators made me feel like I was uncovering some great secret. But the lore in this movie is so blunt force and expository it doesn't spur any curiosity. And ultimately, Slender Man can be great metaphor. He's been used as a way of addressing child abductions, self-medicating, our broken medical system, emotional isolation, mental illness, and fear of the wilderness. In this movie he is just a generic monster in a generic monster movie. He's the Bye Bye Man. He's Annabelle. He's It Follows, but shitty. Don't watch this movie. It's not a good movie.",

The VFX and camerawork were admittedly admirable at times and the beginning of the film, though rather cheesy in its premise, seemed promising. But from then on, the plot and acting had no linearity to it at all. The film made no sense, with certain things leading to others things that had no reason and looking for any excuse to show off the VFX budget and shock the audience. I really wish I could get my $15 back but, alas, I'll settle for this bitter review.",

            "content": "My first encounter with Slender Man was with the freeware online game, Slender: The Eight Pages, that went viral back in 2012 scaring the bejesus out of everyone that played it. Actually, what dared me to play the game was the YouTube videos of people playing Slender, watching their reactions of nervous laughter and all out fear. So, this meant I went into the screening assuming this was a horror flick based on the phenomenal game, but sadly no, and as was exiting the cinema accusing the production team of not even having played the game, disrespecting it\u2019s source material or totally missing out on some great potential. But, after a little research, I discover that the game itself was based on a recent folklore meme created by Eric Knudsen (credited as his pseudonym Victor Surge) back in 2009. It\u2019s apart of this creepypasta movement that exploded via internet forums and chain letter style emails with copy and pasted (Hence the origin of creepypasta) images of folklore legends, many of which relating to ancient urban myths and horror stories. This being a competition to who could create the best paranormal images and so Slender Man was born in the Internet. I also discover that this isn\u2019t the first film to feature Slender Man with an American found footage film Always Watching: A Marble Hornets Story which starred the famed, lanky and gaunt Doug Jones back in 2015. And there\u2019s a number of smaller independent films and shorts based on Slender Man. I\u2019ve yet to watch any of these films so it\u2019s impossible for me to make any fair comparisons. So, I went in expecting a film based on the computer game and sadly was greeting with something totally uninspiring and unrelating apart from the scary no-faced character. But does knowing this might not have been inspired by the game make this film any better or forgivable? Hell, no! As a stand alone horror, it\u2019s terribly executed and unoriginal, snatching bits from other horrors like The Ring in terms of myth and more recently the Autopsy of Jane Doe in terms of imagery. So, four girls hear about a scary video that claims to have some connection to children\u2019s disappearances across the globe and so, they dare themselves to watch it during a sleepover, inviting a dark and sinister entity into their lives, the Slender Man. An urban legend that abducts children or sends them crazy with continually hauntings and nightmares. It\u2019s a basic story which needn\u2019t be trashed with poor performances or poor editing. I\u2019m partly in conflict as to which owes more to the failure of this film, because their performances are no way aided by the obvious chopped up ending which would have an effect on the entire film. The trailers clearly indicates the film had some serious re-edits with so many loose ends that they couldn\u2019t have been simply forgot about, because there\u2019s some screenshots that hint at more of some of the character\u2019s unfinished stories. But then I read about the controversy that spooked studios and distribution about promoting and even releasing the film. The Waukesha stabbing in 2014 where two 12year old girls stabbed a fellow classmate apparently to appease Slender Man and out of fear of him killing their families if they did not comply. When this film was announced, one of the fathers of the girls who committed the stabbing, urged local cinemas to refrain from showing the film, calling it \u201cextremely distasteful\u201d And this isn\u2019t an isolated incident, there has been a number of acts of adolescent violence spurred on by the Slender Man myth. But ignoring the controversy, the film is poorly made and is not a good representation for director Sylvain White\u2019s relatively small filmography. It\u2019s super clich\u00e9d with bad plot lines, poorly acted and has such a weak script, and even weaker scares. The script and story are just plain stupid most of the time, again maybe owing a lot to bad edits, but no one would venture into dark woods, or walk the street alone at night when under threat. The imagery isn\u2019t that terrible, trippy and subliminal at times but it\u2019s nothing new and isn\u2019t enough to save the film at all. Considering the amount of source material there is, and for me, just coming from the game; there\u2019s so much potential that got sadly wasted and missed that makes me believe I could make a better Slender Man movie. Only thing I thought suited the film was some of the sounds, the tolling bells and the looming hum. This film is begging for a spoof, especially when one character prematurely expresses his sex face. It\u2019s just one of the worse horrors I\u2019ve seen lately, it\u2019s one of the worse films I\u2019ve ever seen.

But so what? I mean if anything, I did this backwards. I felt like this is the kind of movie that I'd have to be intoxicated to watch, but I feel really mean saying that...so, let's not say that! Instead, let's just say that this is definitely one of the worst movies I've seen this year. \n\nI don't really know where to start and I don't want to spend much time on this but let's get started. The screenplay is probably the worst thing about this film. I can tell this is the kind of film that was pushed out really quickly to make bank, but it came out a few years too late. This screenplay didn't really have a beginning, middle and end. The characters weren't given any distinctive quality traits that separated them from one another. There were obviously a couple of cool ideas here but it was just so rushed. It was an hour and a half but it flew by like a bullet. \n\nThe other problem was that this film was mostly written in post. Most of its intense, 'scary' scenes were rapidly cut together and paired with bright flashing lights, iffy sound design, and lackluster animation. I felt like the editors were trying to sculpt something out of nothing and it just wasn't there. It sucks because the actors weren't too bad but this film tried to make scares out of nothing. \n\nTo be honest I'd rather get back to drinking so I'm going to cut this review short. I normally write reviews to help myself become a better writer but I don't feel the need to elaborate more on this. Cheers!",

The established canon being torn to pieces, the cliche and overdone orchestral jumpscares and plot, and the complete lack of any substance had me busting my gut in laughter. Almost seeming like a parody of the mythos, this film is a must-see for anyone interested in creepypasta, just for the raw comedic value.\n\nAs it stands on its own, though, without any ironic enjoyment, the film is utter garbage. Four nondescript boring leads in a town that apparently has never heard of light switches, flashlights, or common sense, embarking on a soulless, incoherent plot about kidnappings, brain viruses that are like computer viruses(?), and the corniest acting and scenes this side of the millennium. If you want a genuinely good horror flick, then this movie will make you either fall asleep or contemplate jumping off a building.",

Directors nd writers put no though or energy into this at all. It was cheesy, predictable, and downright boring. All this was, was a simple cash grab piggybacking off of someone else's success.

With this being said, there were a few scenes that shinned beyond the occasional jump scare, but that couldn't save the movie from establishing itself as a complete train wreck.

Maybe seven or eight years ago, definitely not several years after the tendrilled, blank-faced figure hit peak popularity, and definitely not after a poor girl was assaulted by two impressionable young girls in his name only four years back. Well, here's Slender Man now, a terrible movie adaptation of an already worn premise that's torturous to watch in every single way imaginable.\nYou know exactly what kind of movie you're in for within the first few dialogues of Slender Man. The four \"teenage\" girls speak like they're forty-year-old men reciting their best Generation Z impressions, all while giving the spooky trees surrounding them a solid run contending for the film's most wooden performances. Lead character Hallie (Julia Goldani Telles) is an especially boring black hole of charisma that's impossibly hard to root for given her next-level stupidity and complete void of personality.\nWhere there's no logic in Slender Man's character development (which it doesn't really have to begin with), there's even less in its titular big bad. With the abilities to appear in dreams/visions, manipulate tree trunks and tree branches (?), as well as haunt social medias in a shameless rip-off of The Ring, none of the Slender Man's powers have any sort of correlation, sense, or palpable installation of fear. Also, he's got tentacles.\nReally, unless you're thirteen years old and on some early 2010's scene, there's nothing scary about a very tall man without a face wearing a ([n] admittedly dapper) business suit. Apart from some truly horrid VFX more than a notch below the quality of a student film, the only frights arrive by way of the cheapest of the most leading of choreographed of jump scares harbored in inappropriately messy, nonsensible horror sequences.\nPerhaps the most insulting part of Slender Man is the moral haphazardly slapped onto the epilogue. In a tasteless attempt at justifying its controversial existence, the film's closing monologue involves a character describing Slender Man's true powers as a virus preying on curiosity, specifically online obsession. It's an obvious nod to the 2014 tragedy in which two girls stabbed their friend to near death as an offering for the fictional online creation, but it's downright offensive the film thinks it has something important to say.\nWith awful acting, writing, directing, storytelling, and every other imaginable aspect that goes into movie-making, Slender Man is a film that lands dead on arrival. There's not even a trace of ironic fun to be had with it.",

            "content": "Slender Man is based off online stories about the titular supernatural being whose fame was born 9 years ago and died about as far back. In the film, a group of girls decide to summon the Slender Man to prove he doesn't exist, but when one of them disappears all hell breaks loose.\u00a0\n\n\n\nFind a comfy seat, settle in, and try not to fall asleep as Slender Man is so thin there's barely enough substance to keep you awake. Nothing about this past the 15 minute mark is at all engaging. It starts off quite well where it does a fine job introducing its protagonists, setting up the legend behind the Slender Man character, and had me keen to see where it ends up heading. But where it goes isn't scary, suspenseful, or even barely interesting... it's a straight up bore and going into the third act I was fighting to stay awake. It progresses so agonisingly slow and the occasional attempt at a horror sequence rips away any suspense as oppose to introducing it. There really isn't much variety to the horror sequences either, one or two moments are unique in that they're not going straight for the jump-scare but rather the presence of something creepy in the background.\n\nAs time goes on and the Slender Man starts becoming more physically involved in the horror sequences it becomes even less scary. It's one of those situations in horror where I feel like a less-is-more approach would have worked much better in generating scares. Any time it looked like it was starting to build suspense it completely ruins it with a predictably timed jump-scare or by simply showing the Slender Man which completely took me out of the film every time.\n\n\n\nI want to highlight the editing here which is at times absolutely shocking and also the basic progression of the story that at times didn't make sense from scene to scene. Some of the editing and scene transitions are noticeably dreadful and jarring to the point where I couldn't tell what I was watching in some action/horror sequences because of jarring rapid cuts. And it's not just the editing within sequences that's awful, it genuinely feels like at times entire scenes are missing as it cuts from one location to the next and I'm straight up lost. For instance, as I mentioned in the premise a girl goes missing, when this happens in the movie one second it's day time and she's there and then in literally the next scene it's late afternoon and she's now missing. It took me a bit of time to gather what had happened and it's not the only transition that is dreadfully executed. And then I did a bit of research and found that Bloody Disgusting is reporting that major scenes were cut from the film by Sony/Screen Gems in fear of backlash to their gruesome nature.\u00a0\n\n\n\nAs far as the performances go, none of them really stand out as being any good. The four lead teens are played by Joey King, Annalise Basso, Julia Goldani Telles, and Jaz Sinclair and none of them really make an impact. Annalise Basso is the one I'm most familiar with as she was great in both Captain Fantastic (2016) and Ouija: Origin of Evil (2016). However she really isn't given much to do and I'd say is wasted in the story. Joey King I didn't really enjoy in here, she didn't really sell me on the situations her character was in, and this only adds to her questionable year with her role in Netflix's The Kissing Booth\u00a0which isn't good in the traditional sense. Julia Goldani Telles I'd say contributes the most to the film in that I found her character at the very least slightly engaging and at times was rooting for her specifically to succeed. She sold me the most on the horror of some sequences so I guess there's one positive.\u00a0\n\n\n\nI wouldn't suggest Slender Man to anyone, even if you were a fan of the legend 8 years ago this doesn't offer much content to scare you and is ultimately severely disappointing. There's a real lack of suspense and terror in the film with only the first 15 minutes being effective and a very small handful of scenes that followed actually bearing a tense nature. Watching this is a waste of time, time that could be spent towards an actually good horror movie that'll scare you as oppose to putting you to sleep.\u00a0\n\n2.9/10",

Wow this was a terrible movie. I never expected much in the first place. When they first announced that the movie would be made I thought maybe they could make a decent horror movie out of it. Then the first trailer arrived. It was a bunch of random creepy images and didn\u2019t even involve Slender Man at all. That\u2019s when I knew it would receive horrible reviews. It currently has an 11% on Rotten Tomatoes, 29 on Metascore, and 3/10 on IMDb. The plot was horrible. Very predictable, a bunch of jump scares, stupid decisions, and many laughable moments. The cast was horrible except for Annalise Basso, who is actually a good actress. But the order of disappearances for the girls goes from best actress to worst actress. Because of that the whole ending was so painful to watch. It was pretty funny to watch. The last 5ish minutes was hilarious. Because I don\u2019t care I\u2019m going to spoil it. The girl we\u2019re left with is freaking out because of everything that\u2019s been happening so she goes to the woods to give her life to Slender Man so it can all end. When Slender Man goes in to full monster mode to take her she runs away screaming. Like a few seconds ago she wanted to give her life. Another hilarious moment with that girl is there\u2019s a part where she goes over to this one guy\u2019s house and they\u2019re about to have sex. She looks at his face and it\u2019s violently shaking with a smile and the room is spinning and she\u2019s screaming. It was one of the funniest scenes in a movie I\u2019ve seen all year. The last dumb scene I\u2019ll talk about came earlier in the movie. Annalise (the good actress) went missing and the three girls go into the woods at night to get rid of something they love as a sacrifice to Slender Man so they can get her back. The girls are supposed to be blindfolded and not to look because if they see his face they\u2019ll be messed up forever. Of course one of the girls gets scared so she takes off her blindfolds and sees him, which had horrible effects and looked dumb. Then it\u2019s just a bunch of screaming and tripping through the woods followed by fake jump scares. There is not much good I can say about the movie. The only things are that Annalise was a good actress for the 15 minutes she was in the movie and there was maybe two instances where it was sort of creepy. Honestly it could\u2019ve been a good movie if they did a plot similar to the video game, like a found footage thing with the plot of the game. Instead we got some funny jumbled movie with bad acting from Julia Goldani Telles and Joey King (who has been in horrible horror movies recently). This movie is going to win some Razzie Awards for sure. Don\u2019t see it. Don\u2019t waste your money. If you want to watch laughable horror film then this is the movie for you. My Grade: D",

I have to say, the only thing that \"scared\" me was the noise and music build up to the jumpscares, but once you get into the rhythm of the movie it's not scary at all, because you expect the jumpscares, and that's really the only scary thing this movie has got going for it. One of the other issues I had was the lighting. I understand it's supposed to be a dark, scary movie with silhouettes and shadows, but some sets were so dark that you couldn't see what was actually happening. The other lighting extreme was when a character would be walking in a dark place and suddenly shine their LED phone torch right down the barrel of the camera. If the effect of this was to temporarily blind you, then it's spot on.\nA few things in this movie actually made me laugh, like some of the scenes, acting, and a couple of the jump scares even made me giggle.\nThe only good thing about this movie was the camera work. There were parts of the movie where characters were experiencing hallucinations and nausea, and the camera work did an excellent job of portraying that feeling to the audience. Apart from that, it is not worth the cost of pop corn and tickets.\nOverall, this movie is boring, cringey, too long, and uneventful. The acting, although hilarious at times, was unconvincing. I recommend saving your money and skipping this \"horror\" movie.",

Sony could have done so much with this movie if they only had good writers and a competent director. This movie was a joke, and not a funny one. I went to the movie with my girlfriend, and we spent the whole movie, along with the rest of the audience, laughing at the CGI in the \"scary\" scenes and groaning at the \"character development\" scenes. It was a cringy mess. If you've seen The Ring, (A great movie by the way, would absolutely recommend) than you've seen this movie. They did not go off of source material at all except for the way Slender Man looks. This movie could be so much better if only Sony had hired/compared some people who worked on the Slenderman games and original stories. Especially the guys of Marble Hornets. This movie had 20 thousand times the budget of Marble Hornets, but that series is 20 thousand times better. Characters: 2/10. Bland, boring, but the acting was passable. Source material: 2/10. They got Slenderman's look right. CGI: 1/10. The dog from Bye Bye Man, the cats from Catwoman, hell, the Amazing Bulk looks better. \nMovie theatre atmoshpere: 7/10. Had a blast laughing at the movie with everyone. Everyone had a good time for all the wrong reasons. This movie makes you feel comfortable, the last thing a horror movie wants to do. Scares: 2/10. One or two got me, but only because shaking/twitching/possession rattles my cage. Total: 14/50. Would not recommend as a horror. Go in wanting to see a horror comedy like Scary movie and you'll have a great time. Better luck next time Sony. Sincerely, a disgruntled 15 year old.",

The popularity has kinda died out.\n\n'Slender Man' is a water down horror movie with more yawns than thrills. It's painfully dull. So boring in fact, I actually fell asleep 12 minutes into it. Of course I had to re-watch it which was horrible.\n\nThere's nothing redeemable or anything good about 'Slender Man'. The script is terrible with endless amount of horror movie clich\u00e9s you thought died out for good. The clich\u00e9 of how teenagers talk in these type of horror movies. Not forgetting the questionable decisions that leads to their demise.\n\nAll the performances were pretty bad and not convincing during the more \"scary\" elements - Just made the scenes more funny to be honest. Joey King is on a winning streak recently by starring in terrible movies, and she's really bad in the movie.\n\nThe atmosphere or tension is none existent to build up any suspense, just loud jump scares through out. Most of the quiet scenes felt like filler than anything else. When it tries to be creepy, it's embarrassing.\n\nOverall rating: Sony, YOU HACKS!",

            "content": "Just to preface, I don't feel good about criticizing Slender Man. It feels like telling a kindergartener that their fingerpainting is lazy and derivative. I wasn't expecting too much going into this movie. And within the first 10 minutes, I gathered enough to know that the movie didn't want you to expect much of it, either. I like to lump movies like this into a category I call Sleepover Horror, along with recent gems like Bye Bye Man, Wish Upon, and Truth or Dare. Sleepover Horror does not hold itself to very high standards and asks that audiences do the same. The only standard is that it must be PG-13, catering to young adolescents who want to be spooked with their friends under a pile of blankets on the couch on Saturday night. To be frank, I have a soft spot for these kinds of movies. My first forays into horror were films just like these from a previous era (circa The Grudge). And when you're 13, you don't know or care that they're mediocre; they deliver what you and your friends want. So I would never grade Slender Man with the same rubric as something like Hereditary. Apples and oranges.\n\nBut even the nostalgia of my younger years couldn't redeem this failed attempt at movie making. I actually think it started out fairly promising. The premise was good enough, the characters were good enough, and the atmospheric tension was good enough (also, props to Joey King for acting her heart out no matter what script she's handed). For me, the biggest stake in the heart of this movie was pacing. When we're dealing with Sleepover Horror, I can forgive a lot: bad acting, ridiculous dialogue, painful plot contrivances, exposition through text messages, etc. But I can't forgive boredom, which Slender Man dished out in full service. I was along for the ride until Hallie's date with Tom: perfectly fine scene, but I have no recollection of what happened after that. I blacked out. I can't remember anything, because nothing in the following scenes made any sense plot-wise and therefore blurred together in a feverish attempt to mimic \"The Ring.\" I came to around the part where Wren's trying to jump out her window for some reason, but by that point, I was no longer invested. If Slender Man had shaved 15 minutes off of its runtime and trimmed some of its fat, I think I might have held out until the end. It was a 90-minute movie that felt much, much longer.\n\nNot to pile more dirt on its grave, but I have a list of other minor issues with Slender Man that I want to get off my chest:\n\nI don't even know if the writer's originally planned this script with Slender Man in mind as the Big Bad. The fact that it's called Slender Man is totally meaningless; the film barely addresses any of his lore. It may as well have been called Spooky Steve, or Creepy Creeper, or Bye Bye Man 2. If you're going to make a movie specifically about Slender Man, you should probably draw upon what made him creepy in the first place. Like how he's always stoically planted in the background; he never moves and you never see him up close. That shit can be really effective for spooks (see \"Courage the Cowardly Dog\" episode with Ramses and the slab). As soon as we see him up close, he's robbed of his power. He seemed like a ripoff of the Crooked Man from Conjuring 2, both in the way he looked and moved.\n\nNot to harp on the mythos, but didn't they explicitly mention that Slender Man has the power to hypnotize his victims and lure them in? That seemed to work with Katie, but the other girls were lure-proof. They kept screaming and running away. Hallie even has a weird moment at the end where she's like \"Take me, sir. I'm ready to die\" and then immediately changes her mind and bolts.\n\nWhy did the nurses in the hospital wear old-timey uniforms?\n\nThis movie has a real lighting problem. Most of it is in so much shadow that you can't see the actors' faces (intentional?), and then it'll suddenly cut to, like, the surface of the sun. For viewers in a dark theater, this was torture (and it happened about every 5 minutes). Like in the woods scene, when they have flashlights and then shine their lights right into the camera and it feels like you're in a dentist's chair.\n\nThey couldn't decide who it's protagonist was. My vote would be for the younger sister Lizzy since she gets a great little voiceover at the end that attempts to tie things together with the final word \"ya know?\"\n\nHallie is always mentioning she has track practice but never goes to track practice. What are you hiding, Hallie?\n\nHallie's family dinner is really quiet, dark, and awkward. I hate when movies do this. Hereditary did it too, but it had the excuse that a huge tragedy had just occurred. Wouldn't you at least want to turn on a few lights and play some light dinner jazz?\n\nObligatory library research scene. Why was Wren there? She was just using the computer; does she not have one of those at home? Also, I really wanted to the librarian to play a more central role, like in Bye Bye Man.\n\nI think the director was trying to imitate The Ring with all the fog and bluish tones, but I was getting some heavy Twilight vibes, especially with all the forest scenes. I was waiting for a sexually charged scene between Hallie and Slender Man where she's like, \"How old are you?\" and \"How long have you been 17?\"",

Before going to see this film, I had already predicted that it would be some cheesy and atrocious film rendition of the game Slender Man. Needless to say, my prediction was spot on. First of all, the timing for the release of this movie is way off. The movie should've been released when the urban legend of Slender Man was in its prime. Other than that, the story was extremely boring, cliche, and often times very predictable. Another cliche aspect of the film were its \"horror\" features. Slender Man was riddled with predictable jump scares and little to no psychological aspects. There were only a couple parts that truly scared me. When it came to the atmosphere, the film was okay at best. The dark and foggy forest, Slender Man's home, was truly creepy. This was partly complemented by the sound design including the blowing of leaves and the creaking of branches. However, these scenes still didn't make up for the atrocious overuse of jump scares. Another thing I was disappointed with was the acting. It wasn't the worst in the world, but it certainly wasn't great. Acting is really supposed to sell the plot to the viewer and make the movie more interesting, but the acting in this movie didn't appeal to me or make the movie's already boring plot interesting. It lacked substance and didn't really make the characters memorable. Speaking of characters, the character development in this film was awful. The four main characters were just your typical high school girls seeking adventure. As I've said before, there is nothing memorable about these characters. Lastly, I'd like to touch upon the editing. Everything was fine except the CGI. The CGI was horrendous and made the movie much worse than it already was. A simple solution to this would be to show the main villain less. Reason being because it wouldn't showcase the limited CGI effects and also introduce a more eerie, psychological horror-type aspect into the movie. Great horror flicks like The Blair Witch Project (1999) have done this and I don't see why this film can't. Overall, I believe this movie was outdated for its time, boring, predictable, and simply just a bad movie.",

Other horror films with the family friendlier rating have proven effective at offering thrills and chills without tons of violence or gore (such as Poltergeist, Truth or Dare, and A Quiet Place) so please don't blame the MPAA rating for this film's faults.\n\nI think what ultimately killed Slenderman was the studio and the distributor's fear of OFFENDING a society that THRIVES ON BEING OFFENDED. Naturally, the people that might take offense wouldn't watch it anyway, so it is the audience that ultimately pays the price. 2018 is the year of \"finding something to be offended by\", and the film's backers fell into this societal fad. \n\nI sincerely hope horror's recent return to the mainstream isn't further strangled by the \"hashtag\" society of prudes and wannabe victims that have pulverized the entertainment industry to the point where every movie and TV show feels like a political advertisement. \n\nBottom line: Wait for an unrated home video release for this one...If there is one.",

The acting borders from, \u201cok\u201d to \u201cshamefully bad\u201d, and the script was just horrendous. It\u2019s so all over the place, and the potholes grow larger every minute. The film also suffers from trying to stay tame in order to keep the rating safe for kids to be able to attend. It goes so far down the safety hole that it\u2019s almost more PG than PG-13. There\u2019s no gore, sex, or nudity. The only thing I can think of to maybe justify Pg-13 over PG is that one kid says, \u201cfuck\u201d once. (They say \u201cfrick\u201d other times... seriously) it\u2019s just way too timid, and it borders on being flat out boring. The often beautiful shots (when they\u2019re not raped by hideously cheap CGI) and fantastic soundtrack are all that kept me from passing out into a boredom induced coma. They repeatedly try for the cliche jump scares, but you see them a mile off. It just fails on so many levels, and it\u2019s frustrating because at the root of it all, they really could\u2019ve made something brilliant if they hadn\u2019t succumbed to being lazy, safe, and cliche. I\u2019d say a generous 4 out of 10 (i hate 5 star ratings)and only for the cinematography and score which really are wasted on a turd of a film. The rest is just a sloppy mess. ",

The creepy fiction inspired two adolescent girls to complete an act of ruthless violence that was more terrifying than any story. A quick search of the character reveals numerous accounts of the way this 21st-century boogie man abducts children. These stories are often accompanied with photoshopped images of the figure throughout history, adding to the mystery and allure of the character. \n\nIt was only a matter of time before Hollywood would try to profit off of the character, so naturally, this Slender Man film was born. The film follows a group of high school students who accidentally summon Slender Man into their world. They watch a bizarre internet video filled with spooky shots of forests, pagan looking symbols, and otherworldly bells. Honestly, this reminded me of the VHS tape that is played in The Ring. A week later, one of the girls goes missing, and the rest of the group must face the Slender Man to try to get her back. \n\nFor being based upon a character that has inspired so much imagined and real-life horror, Slender Man the movie isn't very scary. The film is plagued by horror movie cliche after cliche and an ending that was so inevitably mundane that I left the theater wondering why I had even bothered. Save for the wonderfully atmospheric shots and creepy forest settings, there really aren't many redeeming qualities to the film. We see this CGI monster far too often for us to really be scared of the unknown of it. Instead of getting behind the characters as they try to investigate the mythology and motivation of the Slender Man, I spent more time rolling my eyes at their terrible judgment and cringe-worthy dialogue.  There was a real opportunity to craft a modern horror classic based upon what is arguably one of the most terrifying spooks in recent years. What we get instead is a boring and uninspired movie that will have even the most die-hard horror fans wishing they had kept Slender Man away from the big screen.",

We are introduced to the four main characters. (One of the positive points of Slender Man is its actors.) The dialogue and pacing is pretty good, but then things just fall apart. There are a lot of dull scenes of the characters talking, arguing, and investigating without much interaction with anyone else. It doesn't help that the rules to Slender Man are vague and confusing throughout, and the exposition is delivered haphazardly. The ending in particular is a muddled mess.\n\nTo its credit, the actual scares in this are pretty good. They do manage to capture what makes the Slender Man so scary in the first place. There are some really impactful visuals. The director is an artist when it comes to spooky forests and having Slender Man fading in and out of the background. (Although on the other hand, there is an annoyingly large amount of close-ups.)\n\nAs spooky and nice looking as this movie can be, the good bits are just too few and far apart. I can't recommend this.",

            "content": "Urban Legends are things that every middle school and high school kid, as far back as I can remember, have perpetuated through word-of-mouth and online rumors and storytelling in ways that are meant to inspire a sense of mystery and, in most cases, horror through describing beings and encounters just fantastic enough to be interesting while being close enough to reality to be truly frightening. The Slender Man is no different. I am in my mid-twenties and, from what I can remember, I first heard about the Slender Man phenomenon around my junior year of high school (2011). At the time, my younger middle school-aged brother was the type of kid that couldn\u2019t watch even the tamest horror movie without pissing himself. Some of his friends at school had told him about a tall guy with no face that would kidnap you if you stayed out too late (I\u2019m paraphrasing). One night when we were leaving the local rec center, not even 500 yards from our front door, he downright demanded that we call our mom to get a ride home because, in his words, \u201cIt\u2019s too dark out. The Slender Man could come get us on the way.\u201d This was, to me, the dumbest thing I had heard out of his mouth in a while, but I asked for details and he told me what he knew. I thought that this sounded like a cool story. Some supernatural tall guy that comes outta nowhere and steals kids during the night? I\u2019m in. A movie based on this story could go one of a hundred different directions. They could have gone the ultra out-there route and had the Slender Man end up being an alien abducting people (The Fourth Kind, anyone?). They could have made a found footage movie (for less money), also in the woods, similar to the storyline we got, but in a more grounded way with way less computer and phone screen exposition. What did we get, you ask? (this is the part where you get my actual review) We got a 90-minute sequence of teenage girls looking back and forth from each other to their (Sony) phone/computer screens followed by 45 minutes of a CGI tree monster facetiming people before ultimately kidnapping them. There are some decent attempts at fear-inducing imagery early on in the film, many of which were heavily influenced by (read \u201cripped off of\u201d) the Ring franchise, but nothing we haven\u2019t seen done before, better. Character development is almost non-existent. We know one girl\u2019s dad is an alcoholic (though it never plays into the plot) and another girl runs/ran track. That is the extent of an attempt made at fleshing out any of the characters in this movie. Many of the sequences taking place in old buildings or in the woods used sound to their advantage and were definitely high points in the theater experience. The notion that something might sneak up behind you after a crunching of leaves or creaking of floorboards is a whole hell of a lot more relatable and frightening than much of the on-screen CGI-heavy visuals in the final act. The ending of the movie, which I will not spoil here for those of you who have been waiting your whole lives for a Slender Man feature film, was one of the most rushed, laziest endings I have seen in a very long time. This leaves the viewer annoyed and ultimately willing to forget any of the slightly more positive areas of the experience in favor of remembering the movie for what it is; a forgettable throw-away with a solid concept wasted on bad storytelling, mediocre acting, and a closing sequence that would drop a student film a whole letter grade.

            "content": "To say this film was mediocre would be the understatement of the millennium. \"Slender Man\" is the reason why moviegoers today are losing so much faith in the modern horror genre. (\"A Quiet Place\" is an immensely better 2018 horror flick.) People say Hollywood lacks originality these days, and you really can't blame them, especially when Sony of all companies makes a film based on an Internet creepypasta... from 2012.\n\nI have a theory: had this film been made at the height of the Slenderman phenomenon 6 years ago, the effect would've been a bit stronger, and the film would've probably done slightly better at the box office. (This film has only been out for a day and I don't see it staying in theaters for more than a month.)\n\nAnd now for the actual movie. The acting isn't too horrible, but that's not even the main issue. Any frightening characteristics still associated with our old pal Slendy are now gone. Rather than have our sharp-dressed antagonist be a horrifying, rarely-seen stalker that watches you from afar, they've made him into a physically destructive, confrontational, borderline-slasher villain, like a paranormal Michael Myers. Other than his trademark suit, nothing about this movie truly says SLENDER MAN. Not even the infamous circle-and-X logo makes an appearance. Even Slendy's edgy fanboy Masky is absent. (Fans of the \"Marble Hornets\" franchise will understand.)\n\nSpeaking of which, if you want a more effective and unsettling picture about this jaded internet meme, go watch the \"Marble Hornets\" videos on YouTube. The 2015 feature-length spin-off \"Always Watching\" is almost as bad as the 2018 film, so pick your poison, dear viewer.\n\nIn conclusion, getting murdered by Slendy would've been far less painful than this 93-minute embarrassment of moving pictures.",

And the one that spawned this film is one of the first & best!\n\nSLENDER MAN.\n\nThis particular tale started out as a short story on the net. From there, it blossomed into a national phenomenon, in good ways, & bad. Does this film do ol' Slendy justice? I would say....a little, but not fully.\n\nDespite being 1 & a half hours long, it felt a lot longer, it crept along at a snails pace which, I'm sorry to say, hurt the film overall. There were good parts, to be sure, but it took FOREVER to get to them! The film's atmosphere was that of a modern gothic mystery, but then it de-evolved into a clich\u00e9 slasher flick without the boobs or gore!\n\nThe cast did well with what they were given which, sadly, wasn't much. I did believe they were a group of semi-misfit teens who messed with something they didn't fully understand till it was too late. I just wish these young starlets had been given better material, better direction....really, just a better movie. They were given half a can of corn starch & 3 packets of hot sauce & told to make a meal, & they managed to make something at least edible.\n\nThe effects were fine, but not enough to save the film. Slendy looked as he was supposed to, & there were parts where reality was distorted in a way that made you question what you were seeing.\n\nThe music was generic, but harmless. The sound effects were a good blend of harsh tones & white noise meant to disorient & set your jaw on edge so you didn't know what to expect, it was a moderate high point.\n\nSadly, I can't recommend Slender Man to any hard core Slendy fans. All the elements are there, but there's just....something missing. It's like the difference between regular candy & soda, & the sugar free & diet stuff, mainly the aftertaste. It's not an insult to the Slender Man, because it's not even on his radar; it's a generic ghost story that someone crammed Slendy into, which resulted in, not a bang, not a whimper, but a dull \"...meh.\" I have no choice, but to give it 2.5 stars outta 5. See it once for the curiosity; but once you see it.....it'll be pretty easy to un-see it.",

On top of the movie being dull, Slender man himself always looked cheap and unrealistic. How am I suppose to fear him if he looks like something you would see on a YouTube video? Even with the few close ups of Slender man didn't do it for me. He looked cheap, not real, and fake. The build up to scares were okay, not the best, but acceptable, but the pay off was so bad.

The writing is clunky and on par with a first draft, the acting is stiff and phoned in, and there's little sense of direction to be found anywhere in the movie.  Slender Man himself looks like he's wearing a sock over his head.  Unfortunately, this movie is a complete flop in the horror department as well.  When they're not unintentionally funny, the scares are mostly flat and lame (but don't worry, the movie compensates with obnoxiously loud music).  Even if you get scared at first, you probably won't get scared by the end, because this movie is as repetitive as all get out.  As an example, there's a certain scene in which a character gets scared by Slender Man and then wakes up in bed, only to immediately get scared and wake up again.  Seriously.  It's enough to make me wonder if this film is intentionally bad, because I can't imagine that anyone who was making this film thought this was passable.  Above all, this \"movie\" is a feeble attempt to cash in on an internet trend that faded into obscurity long before the movie came out.",

I found myself saying \"oh, remember that bit of information. It's probably going to be used later on in the film.\" Nope. There were just so many dead ends in this film that I can't even fathom why it was made. In conclusion, I've seen better horror films on YouTube. I don't think you should see this movie.

I mean, the editing was atrocious, the camera work was average (hence why there is still a half star on this), the writing and acting was nothing short of comical.  Most of this movie was boring, like to the point that I fell asleep for 10 minutes, and didn't even realize that the scene had transitioned.  This film also has some fetish for random shots of the forest that look like stock footage that was edited to look so dark that you had no clue to what the hell was happening on screen.  You couldn't see a damn thing, it was so dark.  Overall, this is garbage tier, and had one \"Scary\" scene that made me laugh out loud.",

But one of the most glaring problems is the black girl character, where in the trailer its shown that she stabs herself in the eye at school, however the movie completely cuts this scene to idk, keep it PG-13? For the kids? Well congrats, they've made it where the last scene with the black girl doesn't even show her dying, nothing. She's just gone for the rest of the movie w/o any explanation. And final point...not scary in the slightest. I was impressed by one scene near the end featuring Slender Man that made the film a bit more entertaining, but it just isnt nearly enough.",

Of course I had to re-watch it which was horrible.There's nothing redeemable or anything good about 'Slender Man'. The script is terrible with endless amount of horror movie clich\u00e9s you thought died out for good. The clich\u00e9 of how teenagers talk in these type of horror movies. Not forgetting the questionable decisions that leads to their demise.All the performances were pretty bad and not convincing during the more \"scary\" elements - Just made the scenes more funny to be honest. Joey King is on a winning streak recently by starring in terrible movies, and she's really bad in the movie.The atmosphere or tension is none existent to build up any suspense, just loud jump scares through out. Most of the quiet scenes felt like filler than anything else. When it tries to be creepy, it's embarrassing.Overall rating: Sony, YOU HACKS!",

Where to begin? I guess we can start with the acting. You know how there's that horror movie cliche where the characters wearing the least amount of clothes die at the beginning, but the surviving characters lose more and more clothing as the movie goes on? Well, Slender Man is like that, but if the acting got worse as the movie goes on. I mean, there is some intense scenery chewing from our leading ladies. To put it bluntly, the script is a lazy mess. It doesn't follow it's own rules for how Slender Man behaves. Characters say and do random things that are never brought up again (like the main character being on the track team, which is never ever used by the story). Some scenes read like an emo highschool girl's BDSM fantasy. Several scenes rip off of Marble Hornets very poorly. There are several \"dream-within-a-dream\" scenes that are laughable at best and boring at worst. In fact, that's a good analogy for this whole movie. Half of the movie is hilarious and the other half put me to sleep!Now for Slender Man himself. Sometimes he looks like a bloke wearing a tube sock on his head. Other times he looks absolutely T H I C C. Like, this guy has some hips that just don't quit. He's not very slender at all! Also, some of his effects look like the crew for Birdemic came in and did the CGI. There's a shot of him standing in the woods in broad daylight with UNFINISHED tentacle renders floating behind him. Also, there's a chase scene at the very end of the movie that looked like a PS1 era cutscene. It was so cringey it was a riot.The soundtrack is the only saving grace of this film. Ramin Djwadi did the music, and there are some good horror vibes and ambient noises. The end credit music is easily the best music in the film, although that may have been colored by how happy I was for Slender Man to finally be over. This is a GREAT bad movie to watch with friends.

I had no interest in watching it, but she did and I wanted to go because I guess it might have been at least funny. And it kind of was. We were basically ripping on it, making our own MST3K commentary on the film. There were two other people in the theater, and I'm pretty sure they were on a date night and we both ruined it. Suffice to say we both had a fun time watching it. And honestly if I wasn't watching it with her and making fun of it, I would probably be a lot madder at this movie. Because regardless of the viewing experience, the hype is real! This movie is as bad as people made it out to be! Like I thought that maybe I can find a positive about this film, but honestly it's been a long time since I've seen a movie that is fundamentally broken! Like I cannot think of a single thing about this movie that worked! Maybe there are some creepy imagery that worked, but there are far better horror films with the same imagery that work a lot better! I guess the sound design is also kind of decent too, if you ignore all the stock sound effects. Other than that, nothing!The acting is horrible! Like not a single actor in this movie is good! They are all terrible! But I mean even with good actors could not save the writing of these \"characters!\" None of them get developed! They are all interchangeable suburban teenage girls, except one is apparently a track star, one has red hair, one's black, and one looks like a cross between Regan from the Exorcist and Chloe Grace Moretz! There's no main character as the movie shifts around the four leads but they all act the same! It's basically one spirit character of whine and whimper and make faces that probably look like they are scared! The directing is **** Not only did director Sylvian White not direct the actors to be good, but so much of the framing and shot composition is **** He couldn't make a movie scary because it is filled with jump scares! Nothing but jump scares! There are creepy imagery, but it is blatant how hard the movie wants to be the Ring of the YouTube generation! The editing is also bad, making the timeline of events confusing and jarring! The rules also do not make sense! One of the scenes have the girls give up something precious to them, but they have to be blindfolded to do so and not take it off to look at Slender Man, or else you'll go nuts. Well one of the girls did, and yet they all start going crazy? Like Slender Man is a troll! Speaking of him, if you are afraid of ****ty CGI monsters, then do not watch this movie! Otherwise the Slender Man looks stupid and ridiculous! The plot drags out as not much happen! It's not even a fun movie to watch on it's own it's just a drag to watch!It's not like a Slender Man movie can be good. Because it can be, but there was no way a Hollywood adaptation of the Internet legend would be anything but bull****, let alone a movie made by Sony! If you want a decent Slender Man story, go look up Marble Hornets or Everyman Hybrid on YouTube. You want a good horror film like this about creepy imagery and a cursed video, go watch the Ring. If you want to watch a good horror film about scary white people, go watch Get Out! I can kind of recommend this movie if you want to watch it with friends and rip it apart as like a bad movie night. But even then it's not really all that much of a fun bad movie to watch. It's just flat out bad. Don't waste your time! But if you do, just imagine every time the bell rings, it's really just Taco Bell and Slender Man wants his victims to try their new Nacho Fries. And nothing is more scary than eating Taco Bell!",

There are some really impactful visuals. The director is an artist when it comes to spooky forests and having Slender Man fading in and out of the background.

While it5.7/10 Honestly people are being way too harsh to this film calling it the 'worst horror they'd ever seen\", and just being completely extreme and vague in their \"criticism\" without actual legitimate explanations why they hated it. While it definitely isn't a good film overall, it's about the best portrayal you could expect from an internet horror concept which is essentially a very creepy tall faceless figure that takes children and is seen in old pictures that have been clearly photoshopped. The concept is creepy but really has no complexity or depth. This film at least delivers that same ominously bizarre atmosphere with sparing shots of Slenderman with the simple plotting and overall themes. You cant really expect a plot that goes anywhere with that simple subject matter. The film does drag on in between the creepy scenes with the annoying actresses brooding on in their personal terrors. Another huge problem is that Slenderman shows up maybe a total 2 min of the entire film combined, and the scares are very cliche and standard when he's sparingly featured. There is one sequence in the library that is done properly and has a considerable amount of decent scare ambition. The sound design and effects were firing on all cylinders throughout the film and created some very good sonic tension at times. There was also a considerably solid amount of solid camerawork throughout. Before you know it the film is over and the finale is ok at best but very abrupt. This film is the epitome of middle of the road cliche horror with some decent ambition at times, and is in no way deserving of such an embarrassing low rating.",

There are some moments that the characters do some dumb thigs, they make pretty clear that they can't uncover their eyes in one moments and see SlenderMan or they are going to be mentally destroyed somehow, and after 10 seconds one of the characters does this exact thing and one second later all of them with the same thing. The movie try to give some possible ways to combat the monsterm, but it is so weak the way that they did it, one of them get to one place to take something, them she takes it and it got mentioned one other time, but it does have zero influence during the course of the movie, it didn't made any sense. The conclusion of the story is also pretty down, like characters saying one thing and doing another, it got so slow in a point that it didn't even scare you anymore, this a high problem in this movie, the script could have been a bit better done and creative. Another big problem in this movie, is that, that the characters aren't much relatable in a way that you would care and cheer for them, there isn't much development for them, and the little bit that happend it didn't really implies in you caring for them, cosidering that this movie is about people in dangerous and not about the monster, they had to make we care for them to this work better, unfortunately it didn't worked out in this way.The sound of the movie are great, for real, they are done with maestry, there are a lot of moemnts during the movie that i got scared, and it was very thanks to the sound design here, it is very similar to sound that happened in the game from years ago, a very strange and messy thing, wich did represented in sound the creepy and crazy creature very well, the sound in the forest, the details that they did applied in the audio section, made this movie be scary.One thing that they did here and it gave us very nice moments, is the suggestiveness, in a lot of moments you see a shadow or a tree, and you be like that it could be that or not, it is good, letting our mind work to see something or not, that did happened a lot witht the characters to, just that in some moments it was very ridiculous, but mainly at the start of the movie, it did worked out very well.The acting is not the best neither the worst. Joey King did a very nice character, the problem is that she didn't had any development, the little that i cared about her, it was because of the actress. Julia Goldani had a bit more emotional moment, i think that she did well in some moments, but mostly of the movie she had a poker face that didn't pleased me very much. Jaz Sinclair also had the most cliche faces during some moments, unfortunately she didn't had much time to work or room to do different things.The CGI is awful here, like it is the worst 10 million dollar budget cgi ever, they did turned the light out of the movie in a lot of moments, wich could have been good to hide the bad cgi, but even with that, the cgi is so exposed and so bad and fake that when they show him, the fear kind of go away, because it is so fake, the creature naturally have a strange form and could scare people easily, but the did invented somethings here with the trees that just didn't worked for me.The movie was working better when the thing was being more of a mental situation, but when they decide to show and interact with the monster physically, things stop working.",

But Slender Man was a special case, mainly because it provoked an almost fatal attack on a girl and because it was perpetrated by other young girls.It was terrible and now we have the fiction in which we have turned it into a monster marketed in the cinematographic firmament.Ironically Slender Man in this film becomes a Freddy Krueger type monster because he comes for you from another dimension but you invoke him watching a video like you did with Samara in ''The Ring'' but soon you learn its performance is the most basic of all because Slender Man follows all the formula of the evil spirit that simply wants to kill. You don't know its final goal and it doesn't matter, he will come for you again and again because it's specified it must do it. Hurray for originality.Empty horror, null suspense, poor coherence, a predictable failure.There are better offers in the genre, this film is absolutely nothing that you have not seen before and I have to say that it's fair to emulate a formula without feeling original but you can do things right but obviously those elements didn't matter to all the people involved in this film.",

I enjoyed playing the game and listening to these urban legends about him, but this movie was.. EH!!!!Just to know, this review is gonna be a funny review actually.Slender Man is directed by Sylvain White, written by David Birke and starring Joey King, Julia Goldani Telles and Jaz Sinclair.The story is about a group of girls summoning Slender Man and when he got summoned, one of them gets missing, and the others trying to run away from him.. this is the whole story!Now, that's what I call a horror-pranks film, it's full of unscary scenes, with Slender Man pranking these girls.. or poor girls.. how did you talk all these pranks from a man without a face?First of all, let's count the dumb choices in this movie...1. They summoned Slender Man from a website, by a link says \"SUMMON HIM\". I mean what kind of creatures can be summoned from a website?2. To \"summon him\", you must watch a video and follow the instructions in the video, and when you're done, congratulation, Slender Man is summoned, go and have fun with him!3. Slender Man is a good pranker! He made me laugh a lot with his pranks... What's dumber than making a pranker creature in a horror movie?4. Oh, yeah, the cast was dumber than Slender Man.5. Slender Man, please, grow up.. stop playing with the trees, it's noisy!!6. The CGI of Slender Man was like a man with some toilet paper rolled around his face.7. This message is for the developers of this \"game\", please, fix the glitch of the faces, and the horror-dreaming stuff.8. One more thing, please, fix the performances too, cause they are bad!9. The finale.. LOL!10. And now, the dumbest thing in the movie award goes to... The script! Congrats to the script, it was super-dumb!WOW, this movie is terribly bad! As I said, it was one of the most anticipated movies of the whole year, but it disappointed me very very much! It easily became one of the worst movies of 2018 -if it's not the worst already-!One more thing, why Katie's father thinks that \"people can not just disappear\"? Wake up, MR. There's something called kidnapping, didn't you hear about it?I think you already know what I'm gonna give this terrible movie, don't you? Yup, it's definitely an F!!Okay, guys, thank you as always for reading my review, let me know if you like my reviews or not, and I welcome all the comments.",
