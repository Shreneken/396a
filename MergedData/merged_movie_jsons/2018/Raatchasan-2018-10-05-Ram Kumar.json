The backstory of Psycho was good.Screenplay: The screenplay in this movie is engaging and brilliant. First half seems to be normal. But, the true fear starts in its second half, though there are very few loopholes.Music: The best one about the movie is its BGM. 80% of the fear is because of its BGM. The dark music which completely matched the film. Gibran again proved himself to be the best music director.Acting: All actors did their best. This is the best movie ever for both Vishnu Vishal and Amala Paul in terms of acting. All the other actors dedicated well.Other things: The runtime in this movie is too long which is around 2 Hours and 50 minutes. But one doesn't feel that the movie is dragging, because of the engaging screenplay. Each and every scene in this movie is essential. Moreover, editing was crispier which added more thrill to the film.On the whole, it would be a great movie if you watch it in theatre.My rating: 4.5/5",

This is the longest rollercoaster I have ever sat on. Very gripping narrative, with a mind numbing, soul quenching background score. From cinematography to editing to acting, all in all a masterpiece.\nMovies first half ends at a point, where you are hungry to discover the killer but the second half leaves you at the edge of your seat until you reach home, still in the reminiscences of the killer, one struggles to sleep. \nYes, all of this despite being completely unfamiliar with Tamil language.",

            "review_title": "Awesome except for having unneeded dramatized ending",
            "content": "The movie is awesome and keeps you engaging until the final climax where suddenly characters started making sillying mistakes and allowing the killer to slip from their hands. Which really was frustrating.\nGiven that the actor asking in few scenes before to another police officer to shoot at killer without thinking but when himself presented the same opportunity doesn't do so. He has a clear shot ahead while the killer is just paused prior hammering the kid. Actor could have simply shot at killer's hammer holding hand but instead he simply moves near and allowing the killer to slip again.In several instances I found it dumb for police officers to gave up their vehicles and chase killer on foot when apparantly the killer is in vehicle.The entire buildup and suspense was truly engaging and the story went quite good untill it reached its climax and closure sequence. Unnecessary past reference that too out of context which lead to illogical conclusion of teasing the killer just to distract didn't made sense. And killer in-spite being diagnosed with hormone disorder disease had surprisingly super natural stamina to keep attempting to arise after every blow. Actor was literally giving the killer third degree kind of beating still killer was amazingly agile and quick on feets.To sum up the frustrating mistakes were:\n1. Police officer not shooting (at least on legs) even when Hero is explicitly repeating to do so on phone.(Atleast he fires at tire. Bless him for that); Plus why he allows the killer to play with cards?2. Hero not shooting killer (hypocrite) when had clear chance. Was he afraid that killer's speed of swinging hammer being faster than bullet?3. The actress while running upstairs away from killer is clearly trying to save the kid but surprisingly she somehow manages to forget the kid in very next scene. Lol. Killler was too scary for her consciousness maybe4. The doctor driving the car when found the kid ahead and after having a glimpse of killer surprisingly turns to feet instead of car to run away. How smart!5. In a chase scene where the actor is chasing on feet and other officer on bike, the killer gets rid of them easily by applying the brakes and making bike officer to bump on the Van. And amazingly the unhurt actor prioritise to console bike officer instead of continuing chase by bike or foot. Bike officer wasn't really fatally injured!",

The lead actor is decent n the actress very hot.\nThe plot is about a man who is obsessed with serial killers n who wants to join film making business but out of family pressure has to join police police force. At the same time there is a serial lurking in the cops's precinct killing young girls.\nThe female who played the cop's sis cannot act for sure.\nSome of the action sequences were laughable n also the last scene with the cop n the killer face to face n the then hide n seek n the action was a bit lousy.\nThe house of the killer had a creepy feel to it n there is sufficient tension n suspense.\nThe background story of the killer was given too much time, in fact the problem with Indian cinema is that they spoon feed too much but thank God there were no lousy songs n unnecessary muscle flaunting.\nThe film deserves a 7 but I am a bit generous with an 8 cos of the effort.",

One of the main reasons being that not a single second is boring and the speed with which the narrative moves is refreshing for its 2 hrs 25 mins runtime length. The other being that I am always looking and searching for a good thriller that lights up parts of my brain in all the wonderful ways only a thriller can.This certainly went above and beyond my expectations. Watching 'Ratsasan' is like going on an exhilarating rollercoaster ride which doesn't want to end until the viewer is satisfied and has been left completely quenched from their craving for a thriller. It is unique and infinitely creative as far as storytelling goes for the thriller genre.'Ratsasan' defines what edge-of-your-seat really means. It masterfully balances all the elements of a great thriller with an intelligence and style that only a handful of movies have mastered as of yet. 'The Silence of the Lambs' and 'Se7en' come to mind and in recent times 'Gone Girl' and 'The Invisible Guest'.'RATSASAN' IS ONE OF THE BEST THRILLERS I'VE EVER SEEN.10/10.",

AND, I an my wife both knew the magician was the killer as soon as we saw her...umm...him solely because he stood out --- white - bad makeup and male body shape, he/she stood out so much, it was obvious - had they used a general brown Indian older man - we would never have guessed it - that was a huge blunder from the director's part for absolutely no reason but kudos to him for trying to divert the audiences attention to the pedo pervert teacher when they first showed the magician on screen but it wasn't a big enough distraction.",

The story, direction took so many aspects from this and mix it up to suit Indian version. Those who haven't watched any of these will feel Ratsasan is great and all that. But I felt it was a huge disappointment to see too many concept copies. Neither it leads a good love story, a predictable prolonged suspense, annoying starting without any purpose of him being aspiring film maker. The story jumps too many emotions just to keep people rolling on with suspense and emotions which it does multiple times.It could have been a great movieif the director stopped too much taking much plots from all these movies to tell a simple story. Though I understand why it is liked by many. Because most Indians don't watch foreign films or even Hollywood films. And it takes granted for film makers to take things from others and pick a story and fuse those elements.Acting are good in parts, but I wish they established a simple story, hold a bit to weave a nice character development of villain and antagonist to fit the story. Overall if you see movie as someone who never watched any world movies than surely it's good film but can't be called the best.",

            "content": "It was a surprise hit of kollywood. There was no popular face associated to the film and hence, no big expectations, but the word of mouth spread quickly and It ran in some theaters over Chennai for over a month. Distributors were ready to release it in Telugu as well. Quickly, the name spread all over facebook and possibly every single social media platform plus youtube and it gained nationwide acclaim. Currently, no. 7 in top rated Indian movies on IMDb. This is because a lot of Indians on IMDb are amateurs whose only job is to exaggerate everything related to Indian cinema. Ratsasan is an example of those films which are good, but overpraised.Story is same as any other Psychological thriller. Feels a little inspired, but the treatment is good. There is an overuse of BGM. There is a different BGM used for almost every single situation ,some of them are really good though.Like every other tamil film, the hero has a love interest, and he won her after beating some goons. Sounds familiar? The action scenes were lousy(as always). The cops may spent months and even years to find a clue about the killer, but our main villian can find anyone's address, threaten his/her family notice being noticed by anyone. Talking about logic? Moreover, it was edge of a seat kind of thriller( watch Theeran Adhigaram Ondru to know what it means). The length is surely a problem.Besides these obvious flaws, I can say Ghibran did a brilliant job as composer ,his sountrack enhances the feel of the film, without it, it would be boring.I can say the film didn't dissapoint me, it's reviewers did.",

Remember he's not the killer, he's was just a school teacher.2) How come the school teacher has the same doll in his house? Remember the teacher only invited the student because they use the same taxi.3) The killer was too overpowered, easily entered the school teacher's house to plant the evidence (like that baby doll). Not to mention overpowering a cop only using playing cards.4) The cops are so incompetent to the point that the only competent cops in the film are the protagonist and some cop that let the protagonist out of the jail. His supervisor constantly being a hindrance, his friend who has aim a gun at the serial killer yet wouldn't shoot him, and even the protagonist himself sometimes would do stupid things like waiting for the schoolgirl to be captured while sitting in the car for about 1 kilometer away.5) Almost everyone would see the twist coming from miles away (the serial killer is the son)Overall, I think it's a solid 7/10. Good thriller but could've been better.",

Back ground score is too obtrusive for this kind of movies and murders the eardrums.When compared to the last A R Murugadoss movie which belonged the so called 'psycho' Tamil movie genre , this one is way better.If somebody finds this edge of the seat and horrifying I recommend Jee Woon Kim's ''I saw the Devil' as a cure",

The BG Score by Ghibran was great, kept me glued to the screen. The children performed so well in their respective roles, and so did Amala Paul, Kali Venkat, Nizhalgal Ravi, etc..

This approach to a \"hunting a serial killer\" is unique and something that will keep you in the \"edge of your seat\". The characters are believable and although you still have to make some leaps, the actors portray them well enough to forgive that.The second half is where the movie begins to show that exactly what our main character was asked to put into his script; \"Bollywood\" moments. Sad to say but the ending and the reveal of the killer is lame and predictable (first word that came when i watched the ending). I was hoping for a \"show don't tell\" type of situation but off course they introduce a character who is only there for a voice-over and exposition before killing him off.I really thought the movie was going to great but damn the ending is disappointing, which is maybe telling of the fact that the producers probably wanted to add some commercial elements in it to better market the movie.",

The editing at the very initial part of the film seems like the creators were in a hurry to narrate the actor's story and the killings. It was like watching too many cut scenes in sequence. Also some scenes could have better cut off to save too many explanations.\n3. The diseased villian so strong that he could stand up even after the brutal bashing by the actor at the end part.\n4. The killings were well planned and brutal but the killer seemed to be just an average one. (No he isn't a raatchasan). Atleast the teacher psycho seemed more terrifying.\n5. There are no CCTVs on the streets. May be the police might not find it handy.\n6. Prothestic department still stuck on dashavatharam days.\n7.

Otherwise, the plot just crumbles.Like most tamil suspense movies the focus seems to be more on sensation than on plot. Most of the other actors (the heroine's character, doctor's character played by N Ravi and many more) it seems are there just to make the film 2 hours and more. They hardly contribute to the plot.Like in such movies nowadays, through coincidence or by accident the clues are found one after another, plot gets unravelled and the murderer is apprehended rather than the hero or the police actually racking their brains and investigating.Watch only if you have nothing else to do.

            "content": "I was simply blown away by the detailing and the research that has gone into moulding the major antagonist (psychopath) character in 'Ratsasan'. After a light-hearted 'Mundasupatti', Ram Kumar returns with a chilling serial-killer flick that keeps you hooked from start to finish. However 'inspired' serial killer plots these days might seem, Ram Kumar's treatment is fresh and this is what makes the film downright amazing!The film starts off a bit slow showcasing the failed efforts of Arun (Vishnu Vishal) in successfully landing a producer for his dark, serial-killer subject, but picks up pace once he transitions into a cop and the murder investigations take centre-stage. We saw a similar psychopath (with motiveless malignity) in ARM's 'Spyder' earlier this year but the forceful insertion of way too many commercial tropes made the film appear tepid overall. I did wonder if someone could make a serial-killer film with negligible compromises in Tamil and I got my answer almost a year later.Ram Kumar's 'Ratsasan' boasts a script that is spine-chilling in itself. It features multiple edge-of-the-seat moments, supported greatly by an eerie background score from the brilliant Ghibran (songs are just about okay, though). There are a few red-herrings thrown early on in the film and having watched a multitude of serial killer flicks (in various languages), it's easy to predict that things are going to get a lot more gruesome in the second half. What I really liked about the film is the fact that the director has not shied away from portraying/talking about murders in all its viciousness, especially when the subject matter isn't one that can be digested easily by audiences.The main antagonist is neatly packaged, in terms of looks, slickness, and a proper backstory. The plot twist is one that we don't exactly see coming but it doesn't come across as startling either - but hey, if it works on screen, it most definitely WORKS. Vishnu Vishal looks fit for the role of a cop, and this time around, he is able to emote pretty well too. Ramdoss is also really good, especially in the scenes where he breaks down completely. Amala Paul is functional, and unfortunately, her character remains underwritten for most part. Some characters (such as Arun's mom, sister, and landlord) don't appear in the film after a few scenes early on, but that's okay considering it is focusing more on the serial-killer-hunt.If you are looking for a racy serial killer flick that has as much substance as style, then I'd say 'Ratsasan' is certainly worth a viewing.",

They could've easily cut out all those drawn out, maudlin scenes and brought it in at 1 hr and 34 minutes. And the last thing is this - Is modern India still so ass backwards that criminal suspects could be freely beaten like that or school kids can be slapped and tormented without someone decapitating the teacher?

If this was released in English, it would gross a copious amount of money, gain numerous accolades and be stored in a time capsule to be viewed by future generations. It is a hallmark of the talent that is being encouraged in the industry right now and I commend those who back such brilliant minds and favour them over the recycled \"mass-era\" malarkey.The movie does a crafty job of building up a likeable character in Arun, a young lad with the enthusiasm to achieve great heights paired with a healthy will to serve. He is not scared to explore his boundaries and think outside the box. He is willing to take chances that nobody else would take and believe in himself when nobody else believes him. His inquisitiveness is his gift but it leads to despicable uncoverings, one that would be taboo in cinema 10 years ago. This character is almost at a parallel with Ram - he is willing to push boundaries.Special mention to the BGM producers and everybody involved in the sound department. I don't have superlatives to explain how well they have done. From my memory, I can't remember a movie with a such a significant role in enhancing/potentiating the emotion of the movie.This is not only South Indian cinema.\nThis is Indian cinema.\nWake up Hollywood.\nIndia is in town.",

There it is, another great psycho killer revenge drama in Indiana Cinema which can be called a Thriller too but not firmly. Although the thriller elements are less comparatively, one might find it Chilling and twisting with no Universal Classic Thrillers in watchlist in the past. Raatchasan is story of an aspiring filmmaker who joins Police department and gets involved in a Psycho Killer Murder chain on which he was supposed to make film earlier. This idea of trying to mix Filmy mind in realistic murder chain sounds interesting already but doesn't get enough boost on it till the core. Otherwise, as a murder mystery and crime drama the film keep everything on high from the twists to storytelling. However, the film comes with some blur loops which i feel are enough to not call it a great thriller but that doesn't mean just this one thriller factor takes away everything from the rest of the brilliant narrative. It might have some mistakes as a thriller but as Crime Drama or a Psycho Killer drama it has all perfectly blended. Couple of things were not done well such as the lady officer'a character which was too childish and non sense. Just a suggestion, it might have made sense if the last case had been the daughter of that lady officer and she had a change of heart. But anyways they left it incomplete and absurd. The actors were good in their roles, the screenplay was tight, music was dull and was put in for no reasons. Direction of Ram Kumar is fantastic considering the kind level Tamil Cinema has, so anyhow he was bounded to do some fumbles like leaving many scenes in bleak, unsettled in hurry. The same film might come out better in cinematic proportions if Remade in some bigger Industries. Certainly, this is a Classic Film and recommended to everyone but frankly it could have been the Bestest ever from the industry where it fell short.RATING - 8/10*By - #samthebestest",

Other casts were also good.But, it's a long movie, it is around 2 Hr 30 Mins. But, don't worry, you will not feel like that the story is dragged. You will enjoy your every minute watching this movie.

            "content": "As I was browsing through Facebook, I came across the IMDB Top 10 Indian films of 2018. Of course I had no doubt that Sriram Raghavan's Andhadhun will make it to the top spot but I was curious to know the second spot, which went to a Tamil film, Ratsasan. I was so happy to watch this film that immediately I had to write the review to let people know about one the best who-done-it crime-thriller ever made in India.Ratsasan tells the story of an aspiring film-maker, Arun Kumar, who wants to make a psychological thriller film. After being turned down several times, Arun finally decides to become a police officer but little did he know that the information which he collected to make a psychological thriller film, will come in handy to track down a psychopath whose victim is teenage school girls in the city of Chennai.Ratsasan starts off with usual murders taking place in Chennai but gets to the point directly and keeps you engrossed till the actual drama unfolds. Few scenes in in the first half will send the chill down your spine while second half consist of momentum building up and will keep you tensed. There is a scene in the second half which shows a school girl's kidnap situation and how the police react to each and every step. It will definitely keep your mouth wide-open for sometme. But main twist is in the end which is the highlight of the film and you will know who is the main culprit here. The action scene in the climax is superbly executed. Credit goes to the director for handling the thriller quite well. Acknowledgement for screenplay as well. Dialogues are good. Story is awesome.. Hats off to Ramkumar for keeping the audience on the edge of the seat. A big shout to the writers for valuable story while dialogues are superb. Background score is superb making the film more intense. Cinematography is nice catching the essence of Chenna city while art direction is simple.Ratsasan belongs to Vishnu Vishal as he will surprise you with his versatile act. I loved the actor playing the role of Christopher. Other actors were equally good.Overall, a perfect what-will-happen-next thriller to enjoy and break-away from your usual daily routine. Superb 4/5",

This type of semi commercial movie can't be great and appreciated.\nArun's hobby is to collect newspaper stories and he makes a room full of newspaper cuts which he uses to write movie scripts, but never shine, and then tries to become a police officer. In the meantime a serial killer is killing school going girls in a brutal manner. Arun is used to this as he has read many articles from the newspaper. He suggests some breakthroughs but the senior lady officer does not care. Here her exaggeration is one of the weak points of the movie. In the killing process, Arun's own sister is killed in the same manner. The father reacts excessive, as the director want to weep the viewers, so lame. Forced sympathy. Strangely the mother has no reactions her lovely daughter has been killed. The make up is really appreciable.\nIt boringly drags a lot as well as some other drawbacks but I don't want to spoil. I would like to recommend this movie, without over expectation, which I had, and I am frustrated. So, assume it is a regular one time watch mystery movie then watch it, you will like it.",

            "content": "This is a movie you'll have to stick with beyond the first twenty minutes or so because the opening seems very disjointed. The principal character, Arun Kumar (Vishnu Vishal), is trying to negotiate a film deal as an assistant director, and suddenly has to do an about face and accept a position as a sub-inspector with the local police. He gets in trouble with his brother-in-law for forging his niece Ammu's (Abhirami) report card, and in an effort to save face with Annu's teacher (Amala Paul), pays for the objects her mute daughter shoplifted at a neighborhood store. It all seems rather confusing until the story line settles into an investigation of serial murders targeting teenage school girls. That's when Arun rises to the occasion and uses his extensive background of studying vicious crimes to solve a mystery that's continually thwarted by an overbearing police captain (Suzane George) who almost never sees things his way.The clever screenwriting reaches a level of complexity when it reveals a circumstance behind the third missing murder victim named Meera. By chance, Meera had a recording device in her hearing aid to help her with her speech, and it provides a clue to the type of music associated with the serial killer. But even that clue leads to an unusual twist that you might see coming, later confirmed when it's revealed that the suspected murderer had a son with an aging disease that left him disfigured and the brunt of cruel derision during his youth.The relentless pace in the latter part of the movie is supported by a tension filled musical score that keeps one's nerves on edge, and even if you've seen dozens of crime movies that hinge on a suspenseful climax, this film will set those apart with a stylistic portrayal of the serial killer as a skilled magician using his talent to confound Arun in his attempt to save a potential fifth victim. The action becomes so dizzying that you won't be able to figure out how the sub-inspector dealt a final blow to the killer with an iron rod. You can replay it any number of times you want and it will still leave you baffled, though one's sense of relief that the serial killer has been stopped will overcome any momentary confusion. I saw this film under the title \"Raatchasan\", with it's English sub-title 'Demon', and after witnessing the brutal manner in which the young victims were killed, you'll find that translation entirely fitting.",

            "review_title": "Well Crafted Serial Killer Movie from South Indian Cinema which challenges South Koreans in Thriller Genre",
            "content": "Once famous Indian director Anurag Kashyap said,' there is more to Indian cinema than just Bollywood. I think regional cinema, specially Tamil and Marathi cinema, are exploring some really bold themes.'It is a travesty that our knowledge of Indian film industry does not go beyond typical Bollywood \"masala\" movies when someone tests our knowledge about the subject. A country like India where every language tends to change its dialect after every fifty miles, Indian film industry further divides into several different regions, specially, in Southern demographic portion of the country and makes us acquainted with Kannada, Malayalam, Tulu, Telugu and Tamil film Industries collectively known as South Indian Cinema.As Anurag Kashyap hints indirectly about risk taking ability of regional Indian cinema in his comment, a Tamil psychological thriller \"Ratsasan\" (Monster) released in 2018 further validates authenticity of his observation. \"Ratsasan\" directed by Ram Kumar shocks its viewer with dark but gripping narrative, emotionally charged performances and tactful treatment. The suspense of this Tamil thriller is so captivating that it kept me hooked till the end even there were no English subtitles available. The way it has been shot, narrated and paced you can easily fathom whatever situation \"Ratsasan\" unravels in its whole run time. Ram Kumar who has directed only two films so far including \"Ratsasan\" seems to be heavily inspired by South Korean serial killer movies like \"Memories of the Murder\" and \"I Saw the Devil\", in one of his interviews he admitted the same. In \"Ratsasan\" he successfully creates similar atmosphere of consistent fear on screen with a potential of sending shiver to viewers' spine.\"Ratsasan\" is a story of struggling film writer who wants to make a movie on psychopaths but after being rejected by many film producers despite having a good script and family pressure he joins police force. Fate plays a unique trick on him after joining the police force when he finds stark resemblance between couple of recent murders and those unresolved cases from the past which he took as research material for his ambitious film script. Though his immediate superior creates few problems for him but with his typical writer's curiosity and instinct he investigates those murders and proves that these recent murders are the work of the same serial killer.Film's main lead Vishnu Vishal as Arun Kumar has done satisfactory job as per director's requirement because role demanded both resourcefulness and vulnerability same time and Vishnu Vishal seems comfortable in balancing both as story's main protagonist. Along with Vishnu Vishal the other actor who shines is Manishkanth who plays Vishnu's brother in-law. In few sequences he steals the show. Amala Pual who plays the love interest of Vishnu just plays the love interest of Vishnu, nothing more.On the whole, \"Ratsasan\" is well crafted serial killer movie from South Indian Cinema which challenges South Koreans in thriller genre but there are certain positive as well as negative technical aspects which need to be mentioned. Background score plays major role in psychological thrillers, if it has been incorporated well, increases viewers' interest in knowing what will happen next. Mohammaed Ghibran as an editor has done splendid work and his score increases the intensity as well as impact of grim situations. Editing seems reasonable not choppy but initial scenes of the film in which Vishnu's progression from failed script writer to police officer has been shown, feels bit hasty, more character development was needed there. Though film's villain Christopher creates right amount of shivering fear in viewers mind but in prosthetic makeup his character miserably fails and looks farcical and could have been better.",

The cinematography, setup, thrilling part of the movie is impressive. So I give it a 6/10. But 8.5 is for the masterpieces, you know. For an irreplaceable flick by the next.Ratsasan is a crime thriller with an experimental angle, obviously not without influence by foreign movies. Few things I liked are police officials being corrupt and lazy. It's funny actually. Few that I didn't liked are fast pace with background score that leads to many unexplained subplots towards the end. Why did Christopher killed the senior police official with a gap of about a decade? Why didn't the senior police told Arun about 6 finger issue on the phone? How did Arun knew the door to underground is towards his left? Why did actually, Sofia reject Christopher's proposal? Why did all classmates made fun of Christopher? And so on...The script is unbalanced, contains heavy subplots towards climax and a few near the first half. One kid abducted, chased and hidden, another police assaulted, abducted, protagonist appear and found out the clue, chased him, killed him all within 30 minutes or so. The maker of the story tried hard to cover all lose ends but not fully did that. Summing up, it's an average psycho thriller, with impressive psycho thrilling setup and good cinematography. A full 54/100.",

            "review_title": "One of a kind!",
            "content": "A thriller is all about deception and revelations, just like a magic performance, and this movie has lots of it. After watching this movie, I can't help but notice how close this movie is to the three acts of Prestige, Christopher Nolan describes in his epic thriller - 'The Prestige'.Every magic trick consists of three parts. The first part is called \"The Pledge\". The magician shows you something ordinary: a deck of cards, a bird or a man. He shows you this object. Perhaps he asks you to inspect it to see if it is indeed real, unaltered, normal. But of course... it probably isn't. The second act is called \"The Turn\". The magician takes the ordinary something and makes it do something extraordinary. Now you're looking for the secret... but you won't find it, because of course you're not really looking. You don't really want to know. You want to be fooled. But you wouldn't clap yet. Because making something disappear isn't enough; you have to bring it back. That's why every magic trick has a third act, the hardest part, the part we call \"The Prestige\".Very few legendary filmmakers in the world have the audacity to reveal the killer, out in plain sight, very early in the movie but still fool us and keep us guessing till the very end. Ram Kumar does it with so much ease. It's very hard to believe that someone who is just one movie old has written a script like this. Ram Kumar doesn't wait to reveal his plot in the beginning. He dives right into the mystery few minutes into the movie and he manages to keep us at the edge of the seat right to the very end. Extraordinary storytelling!One of the major aspects of any thriller is its running time. Lesser the running time, easier it is for the director to keep us hooked to the movie. Ratchasan has a running time of almost 3 hours (2 hrs 50 mins). A lengthy movie like this has all the possibilities of running into dull sequences that drag the movie and rob the audience of a sustained suspense. But I cannot find any dull sequence in its entire running time. Not even one!Few minutes before the interval, the hero zeroes in on who he believes to be the killer and goes to a school to capture him red handed. But when he arrives there, he was told that the person has left for his home. He feels dejected as he has to trace him all the way to his home, which may give enough time for the person to escape. But as he leaves, he senses something is wrong. So, do we. As we can guess, the killer is still at the school. But he cannot do anything but leave, as he has very little information to capture him, at this time. All he has is his gut feeling that something is wrong. The clock is ticking and the killer is still out there. Just when he is about to leave, a little hand stops him. The camera zooms past the hero and we find out it's the hand of a little girl who was molested earlier by the killer (shown earlier in the movie in an excruciating sequence). Entire theatre erupts in claps and whistles, not for any mass hero, but for the screenplay! What a delight to watch.This movie's protagonist also has a love interest but not the usual, no-brainer, only-for-glamour type. She blends in with the story and has a purpose too. Interestingly the only duet in the movie does not take place in a far fantasy place, as it usually does. It happens as the hero is investigating a murder in which he needs the help of his love interest. The best thing about the writing is that each and every character has a purpose and we are convinced of the actions they perform. The purpose and the connection are cinematic at some places but none of them can be brushed away as irrational. Again, screenplay scores!An enormous amount of detailing has gone into every character that makes them look so real and connected, to the story. There are some characters (Kali venkat and one other elderly constable, for example) who are in the frame right from the beginning but contribute very little. But, when the time comes, even if it is for a few minutes, they perform like they have been waiting for that moment. Vishnu Vishal has delivered his career-best performance. Munish Kanth deserves a special mention for his terrific acting. He even outperforms Vishnu Vishal at some places.Music is the second biggest plus for this movie. It elevates the movie into a whole new level. Gibran aptly maintains the eeriness this movie requires with his bgm. So subtle yet so terrific. It's amazing to think that just a melody played on a piano could jolt you and terrify you. Such is the finesse of his bgm. One of the highly talented yet underrated music directors in the industry.This movie is not for the week hearted not because of any goriness but the intensity with which the movie travels, the spine-chilling revelations, number of high octane suspense moments will leave you disturbed even after you leave the theatre.But for thriller lovers, this is one rare masterpiece that you shouldn't miss!",

Under pressure from his mother, he takes a police job from his brother-in-law. Beating suspects is standard operating procedure. A school girl goes missing in an apparent abduction. Arun investigates the case on his own but his disbelieving superior relies on the standardized beatings. A psycho is murdering young female students and leaving behind creepy doll's heads. Arun falls for his niece's teacher Viji.This is a Tamil crime thriller mystery. I like most of this with a few minor reservations. I like the lead. The murder mystery is good but it does get a bit campy with the reveal of the killer. The climatic battle is part superhero and part camp action. The twist is obvious although I didn't figure that the mother would like that. The camp value in all that is higher than expected. It doesn't really fit the brutal gritty realism of the serial killing. Then there is the section of hilarious comedy with the initial meeting with Viji. Don't get me wrong. It's very funny but it doesn't fit the rest of the movie. This film has differing tones that don't always fit together. As for the police beatings, I think it's a great setup to Arun's dislike of this police tactic. Then when they are holding the suspect in the hospital, they start beating him up with Arun's approval. It seems counter to Arun's view on police beatings. All in all, I like most of this even with some of the problematic elements. It's a compelling crime thriller mystery.",

The sense of suspense is immense in both films, there are twists and turns throughout, the brutality and corruption reach breaking levels and the overall atmosphere is chilling. Ratsasan excels at portraying an interesting youthful protagonist and a memorable villain. Yet at times the film seems trite and shakily constructed. The editing skips about quite suddenly and it struggles to juggle its main characters. Many plot elements seem lifted from sitcoms, especially when the characters are being introduced, which made the tone inconsistent. Many other plot elements are clich\u00e9d: rogue police recruit vs. Stubborn commander, serial killer calling card, tragic childhood backstory, and so on. The serious plot elements relied on implausible acts and coincidences: protagonist bumps into the female teacher at the store, protagonist finds the correct auto rickshaw by accident, protagonist enters hospital elevator from behind (I still can't figure out how this was done in time without anyone noticing). Finally, the final magic battle was too silly to take seriously, even if it was quite interesting to watch. I give it such a high rating only for its masterly execution, not the underlying story.",

With continuous twists and turns the movie keeps you glued to the screens and keeps you guessing every 10mins.This edge of the seat thriller has several spine chilling moments which is enhanced because of the apt BGM by M.Ghibran. The writing by Ram Kumar should be lauded for creating and designing the Character of the Psycho Killer. Lead Vishnu Vishal has given a fine performance as the Cop and Others have done a decent job. All in all Raatchaasan's gives more chills which make up for the little flaws it has.\n.\n\ud83d\udc4d Goods : Outstanding Writting by Ram Kumar, The Story itself is the winner.

In spite of the considerable duration, the movie doesn't appear sluggish and the unrelated events have been restrained.The sets are commonplace but still seem scary, especially the hideout.The screenplay is a bit weak and clich\u00e9d - police investigation missing out on simple details and procedures(I couldn't believe that despite of spotting the van, they don't take any pictures, do not alert the traffic and other police to trace and stop it!), the coincidence wherein Arun takes the same auto-rickshaw, the post-mortem indicating no rape but the arrested teacher is a rapist and so on.Overall, the movie is well-made and engaging work.

Hence, I do probably belong to the majority of fans who decided to give it a go after the numerous brilliant 'by word of mouth' reviews. Ratsasan (2018), didn't disappoint. In fact, it blew me away from the very first few moments itself and never let go of the pace for not even a single second.Ratsasan, is about a young aspiring filmmaker Arun, who gets constantly rejected by producers who are unwilling to invest on his projects involving psycho serial killers. Eventually after much persuasion from his family and a standing offer from the force owing to his father passing away while on duty, he ends up joining the Police as a Sub-Inspector. From there, Arun gets embroiled in the chase of a Serial Killer who kidnaps and kills School girls.Writer-Director Ram Kumar, made Ratsasan with a lot of heart and deserves majority of the kudos for enthralling us with the thriller of a lifetime. Ghibran 's BGM is another highlight of the movie and keeps one clinging on to the edge of the seat throughout. Vishnu Vishal does justice to his portrayal of the protagonist who is often chasing shadows in his hunt for the serial killer and is definitely one of the actors i would watch out for in the future. The support cast of Kaali Venkat, Munishkanth (such an underrated actor) and others are brilliant as well.Tamil Cinema is going through a Renaissance right now, one that reminds me of what Malayalam Cinema went through a couple of years ago - one that sadly did not last long. I just hope that gems like Rasasan, 96 , Pariyerum Perumal, Kolamavu Kokila and Vada Chennai keep on coming.If you haven't seen it yet, you are missing out on something special.",

            "content": "Tamil cinema has offered noteworthy thrillers so far and they actually remain memorable for their slick execution and their deeply impactful moments. Ramkumar's Ratsasan stands among the best ones ever made in Tamil cinema. This 3-hour psycho-thriller starts with a very promising intro scene which reveals to us that the film will mainly depend on the mysterious murders that are happening in the city. Ramkumar introduces us right from the beginning to what we are going to experience in the film. The specialty of Ratsasan unlike the previous thrillers is that the director is sticking us with this suspense throughout the whole film. During this, we get to witness an aspirant filmmaker turning into a police officer, his family and his bonding with them, a teacher and a deaf and dumb child, another teacher who misuses his students, and an arrogant police officer who spoils everything. All these subplots are connected to the main plot of the film which revolves around the serial killings of young girls. Even with all these subplots, the film doesn't lose its pace because the director sets us that our only motivation as an audience is to watch Vishnu Vishal's journey to track down the notorious serial killer. Ratsasan is a very different commercial film because it has no dance numbers, no love tracks, no comedy tracks, and no unnecessary things that will ruin the film's pace. The film starts on a lighter tone when establishing the characters but after the interval, the film becomes as serious as it can be. The dark and gritty second half is well packed with twists and turns which serve as the film's main engagement factors. Speaking about the cast, they have all contributed to making this film as impactful as it should be for its strong content. Vishnu Vishal has one of his suitable characters and his performance as Arunkumar makes us want more from him. On the other side, we have Amala Paul, Munishkanth, Abhirami, Suzane George, and Kaali Venkat in the supporting roles scoring well in their given space. The real show-stealer of Ratsasan is Saravanan who plays the main antagonist roles: Christopher and Mary with so much hard work and dedication. We can clearly see on the screen that he has given his best through this film. Even with his minimal dialogues, Saravanan proves his capabilities as an actor taking the role seriously with excellent body language and appearance. Hats off Saravanan and Yasar (young Christopher)! Ratsasan works brilliantly for its adrenaline-rushing background score done by the promising Ghibran. There's no doubt that Ghibran is the heart and soul of Ratsasan. His brilliant background score brings us to the edge of our seats while giving us thrilling moments in the film. A round of applause for Ghibran! Technically, Ratsasan is a well-made thriller. The editing and the cinematography are simply outstanding. Ramkumar has delivered one of the finest films of Tamil cinema. The screenplay is well-written which is why Ratsasan is effective. The flashback portion is so hard-hitting and has a very subtle message that people should recognize. Ramkumar's work should be appreciated for the fact that he has brought a totally different film from his previous comedy Mundasupatti. It's so interesting to see a director who's capable of doing a full-fledged comedy film and an intense psychological thriller in a short span of time. Salute Ramkumar! Except for a few logical mistakes, Ratsasan is a well-researched film and Ramkumar has made sure that the film has a lasting impact through its edge-of-the-seat narrative. Overall, Ratsasan is A MUST-WATCH PSYCHO-THRILLER!",

It's about the police officer Arun who didn't fullfil his dream to become a filmmaker, but proves his emotional and intellectual competence while chasing a serial killer.Vishnu Vishal did a very good job as the police officer Arun in the main role. The cast is filled with incredible young actors, but on top of that some popular actors such as Radha Ravi, Amala Paul and Kaali Venkat. As you see this cast you can expect to see comedy and romantic elements. But it doesn't distract from the main story and each scene has its purpose.From cinematography to performance everything was great, but Gibran's background score was the really standing out point. When it comes to the key factor it's the characterization and performance of the antagonist. There was only one little \"disappointment\" in the conclusion, where a moment to connect to major characters was missed. But expect for that, this is one of the best movie experiences in tamil cinema ever.I would recommend to let your very little children watch it with the whole family and not alone. It's not like the movie is not appropriate for a young heart expect for they won't understand some aspects of the movie. So making them a lil' bit feel safer will be more fun for them.9.5/10",

            "content": "What's the difference between script and screenplay? An expert may tell you that a script is the set of primary dialogues which describe the story while screenplay is the added layer with directorial inputs.I wouldn't recommend such definitions and would rather advise you to watch this Tamil Classic \"Ratsasan\" (2018). Pardon me for saying this but it's a pretty ordinary story. In fact, years back I had seen a CID episode (Yes of Daya Darwaza Todo fame) with very similar plot elements. But the screenplay, the execution on screen makes the movie exemplary. The story deals with a young man, Arun (Vijay) who aspires to be a film director. He has researched extensively on serial killers and has a script ready for a serial killer movie. Unfortunately, none of the producers give him a green signal. A dejected Arun finally succumbs to all around pressure and on his brother in law's guidance, takes up a job as a Police SI. When a teenage schoolgirl gets abducted, her parents then find a mutilated doll's head in a gift box attached to their dog's collar. Arun finds a similarity with another girl who was murdered few days ago, and both of them being 15-year-old school students who were kidnapped while returning home from school. Just like the victim, the hair on the doll's forehead is uprooted, the eyes are drilled, and her mouth is damaged. Apart from that, in particular, there is a knife mark on the corpse's forehead, ears and nasion. The same marks were found in the doll's face .Arun becomes convinced that these were the deeds of a deranged mind but his Superiors completely disregard his theories. Nevertheless the hunt begins for the psycho killer and we find a two and half hours of edge of a seat stuff.The direction is splendid to say the least. Ram Kumar weaves a tale of brutal murders, conceited clues, a 'never say die attitude' possessing protagonist, red-herrings and a wonderful backdrop as a reason for everything that transpired. Editing and camera work deserves a special mention. There's one particular scene where the cops try to rescue a girl from the clutches of the devil. The scene begins with Arun & his team speeding down the highway whereas the girl tries to fend off the antagonist in a secluded mansion. This part is so beautifully shot that without even depicting an iota of violence or gory scenes, suspense is amped up in the minds of the viewers. It's a perfect cinematic experience.As far as the negatives are concerned, I have to say that the villain was shown all too powerful. Consider Ammu's abduction scene where She was captured right in front of her house during her birthday party. Will any serial killer take such a risk ? Further which daring soul would attempt to stash the body in the Dickie of her Father's car who happens to be a cop?But overall, Ratsasan is an engaging thriller for the most part with a taut storyline and compelling performances which keep us hooked till the end.Kudos Kollywood.",

If you start watching it, you can't stop yourself. It's story will keep you engaged and this has only became possible because of its cinematography and the BGM. Most of the horrorness in this film is due to this BGM. The psycho and the police. The first part of the film is not that horror and like a normal crime thriller movie but when the story continues you start crying, laughing, becoming afraid and getting a feeling of fear.

            "content": "Ratsasan is a pitch perfect crime thriller. It haunts you with the very first scene and continues to do so with its tight screenplay and heard before story of psycho killer. Movie's plot delivers more than expected and surprises you with each scene unfolding a new mystery before you.Arun played by Vishnu Vishal is an aspiring writer-director who seeks different producers to produce his feature film he has written after years of research on psycho-killers worldwide. Arun fails to get any producer to back his film. Unemployment kicks in and Arun give up the dream of being the filmmaker and takes up the job of a police officer with the help of his Brother-in-law played by Munishkanth. He moves and stay with his sister Kokila played by Vinodhini Vaidyanathan, Doss and their daughter Ammu played by Abhirami, also the niece of ArunArun finds it difficult to be a police officer due the never ending chores of his senior officers which were forced on him to make him feel no important at all. One day a simple case of disappearance of a school girl named Amuda grabs his attention. The gift box containing mutilated doll found after her disappearance make him conclude that it is not just kidnapping for ransom but a brutal work of psychopath murderer. He finds the pattern in disappearance and concludes to find Amuda dead as it was two days already past her disappearance. Arun takes up the case to track down the psycho killer but eventually fails each time. Another school girl named Meera is abducted and her teacher Viji played by Amala Paul helps Arun to track down the suspect involved in abduction. It was late though as Meera's dead body was found dumped in municipality bin. Finally Arun catches the suspect, a school teacher of Ammu's school, Inbaraj with gift box containing mutilated doll and Meera's school bag at his place. Inbaraj in order to escape hold Venkat played by Kaali Venkat at gunpoint and at the same time Ammu is abducted too and Arun finds the same gift box with mutilated doll head.What I can say after watching Ratsasan is just one word 'awesome'. It is like some serious mind blowing Hollywood flix that got you by your throat and freeze you with the fear of losing out if you even blinked. I have to say that it is not permissible during the movie like that even to go pee or see anything other than screen. The only thought that clouded my mind was, 'catch him Arun, and catch him fast before he abducts another one and another one and another one'.There are few scenes that can jolt you from head to toe and one such scene is when he recovers a body from his own car. It really was heart wrenching.\nThe sole purpose of this movie I can guess is to make you aware of the psychopaths out there in the real world lurching in shadows and waiting for their turn to attack. May this movie be a fiction but is inspired of psycho killer out there who exists for real.Movie rhythm is dynamic. It is fast paced to compliment the situation and need of the well written story. Movie score by Ghibran is top-notch as it instills fear in your skin and so is editing by San lokesh. Movie is mostly shot in low key lighting to show the vulnerability of Arun and it fits perfectly with great direction of Ram Kumar. However, it could have been better, the cinematography I think.Vishnu who plays Arun does some serious acting there and I applaud him for all his effort but who really makes the mark on my mind is the psycho killer who was barely there on the screen and still haunted me. The villain of the movie played by Saravanan did his job really well giving the story it's much deserving villain it needed.This movie has UA certification that means parental guidance is required for viewer under the age 12. However, I don't want anyone below 12 to watch it. Even if you got some faint-heart and no interest in stuff that kills your heart beat please watch something that don't. If you are aged above 12 with heart for adrenaline please stick your ass down on anything and start watching one of the greatest flix you haven't seen yet. I promise you will not regret it, instead you will urge other to watch it as well",

Saravanan nailed as Christopher (the psychopath). Vishnu Vishal, Amala Paul,Munishkanth,Abhirami & all others did really well. Hats off to Ram Kumar, writer/director of this masterpiece. Will must say Ghibran's musical is icing on the cake. The movie wouldn't have this effect except the brilliant background sounds. It's been 3 years since the movie released,but never fails to amaze. This movie set a benchmark in psychological/crime thriller genre of Indian cinema. I absolutely loved it & have watched more than 5 times;but always it gives that much thrill. Highly recommended.",

Granted, yes, I was on the edge of my seat throughout the entirety of it, there was that one CONSTANT repeating factor in a lot of these kind of films that broke Ratsasan too in my opinion.The protagonist and how they were handled in the film...Why is it that EVERY crime thriller HAS to have the investigator be the ONLY one with any ideas about how the crime took place??! Why is it that nobody, not even a single other officer/family member/i dont know the grocery vendor can come up with even the smallest clue that could lead to the conclusion? Why does the protagonist never fail in these films? Where is the vulnerability? Where is the character development? Why do all these protagonists know more than killer and are all 150+ IQ holders with the greatest attention to detail?? Someone please explain this to me. This was the same formula in two other films that I recently watched. Forensic and Anjaam Pathira from Malayalam.And then there's the added aspect of the protagonist being this flawless, good guy, a complete family man who only does good for the society...oh COME ON! He doesn't raise his voice against his senior officers even when his child is in the hands of the killer. This could've also just been the actor's fault because he had one expression throughout the film, seriously. Still, if at all this is the reality we live in, WHERE are all these flawless men?? And to think that this is also a film that presents pedophiles and psychopaths...talk about polarizing personalities. Now, don't get me wrong, there's no fault in someone being a good enough person but when the stage is set to constantly show out the character's heroism, it simply blows down to the typical Indian filmy treatment. The realism that makes these films so exciting gets lost somewhere along the way.ALSO, what was up with the killer's avatar???! I find it extremely hard to believe that the creators of this film couldn't afford an actual Anglo-Indian dude that they had to settle on that almost non-human-like make-up...?? Or at least give him some realistic make up? That was pretty much the last straw for me with this film...damn.All in all it's really just a good thriller film. Good. That's about it. There's nothing new about this serial killer story, possibly not even the killing pattern.",

            "content": "I was blown away by the execution of this movie, It started out kind of routine with the main character and his mundane life being shown. However there is more than meets the eye to this protagonist. The movie masterfully introduces the main character as a movie buff who aspires to become a director and one of his primary ideas is to make a film on a serial killer. In that vein, he is not supported by his family, namely his brother in law who pushes him to become a police officer to escape his joblessness. He carries the meticulous planning of his film idea into his job as it so happens that there is also a killer on the loose who nobody seems to have the faintest idea of how to catch him/her. In the process of figuring out who and why they are killing young girls, the movie also masterfully shows us the way by which the protagonist is stymied in his investigation, in a sort of parallel to how he was prevented from pursuing his passion for filmmaking. At the same time, the director and writer take us on a rollercoaster ride with twists and turns which are plotted and executed brilliantly, keeping us the audience at the edge of our toes and biting our nails. There is not much gore in this movie but the way by which the director and writer handled the relationships between characters and the emotions in the movie, evoked sympathy in the characters that are in the midst of danger, The prime example of this is when certain characters come in contact with the killer and us as a the audience does not want them to die and wants the main protagonist to get there in the nick of time pulled of me. Few movies in that regard have done that for me. Furthermore, the end of the second half is bit prolonged and after building up so much tension the director includes an unnecessary fight which could have been removed. This is the only problem with the movie.\nLastly, hats off have to be given to the actors and the music director for putting in their effort to elevate this movie to another level. (In particular, the actor who plays the main character who carries the whole movie on his shoulders and balances his emotion in each scene very effortlessly)All in all, I was captivated by this movie and I hope to see more of this dirirectors work in the future.",

The film truly deserves praise for its brilliant direction ( by Ramkumar) and immense research which does serve aspects of drama which is both necessary and at times overly done. Catering well to human emotions, the movie even manages to discuss efficiently strong social issues. Though the romance between the protagonist (Vishnu Vishal) and female lead (Amala Paul) seems to be done just for the sake of attracting audience, the movie as a whole is very well created. Props to the crew , the cinematographer (P. V. Sankar) and special effects team for their contributions as well.All in all, this is a highly recommended watch!",

Is it the psycho or someother instinct that triggered the murders?The answer to your spark of excitement hearing the outline will be beautifully sketched out in this full fledged edge of the seat thriller. Vishnu Vishal has come with his career best performance and the role looks tailor fit to him.Amala Paul as the love interest looks convincing though in a minor role.The rest of the cast needs to be appreciated for not going overboard,except Susan George who played hero's egoistic senior officer;it was irritating.The screenplay here is well thought out and sharply written.The film has an innovative reveal to its credit and never packs itself under a commercial framework.The dialouges are short and to the point.Director Ramkumar has efficiently made the writing on to the screen, with the help of the technical side.Ghibran could be easily credited as the new age BGM king, for he deserves no less tag for his work in Ratsasan.The BGM pumps up your heartbeat and adrenaline rush is severe.The sound design is marvellous especially during the second half.P.V.Shankar's cinematography is fantastic.Though the film runs for 152 minutes, it hooks you to the seats with an increase in your pressure as the movie develops.Overall,with a proper psycho story, top class making and efficient direction, Ratsasan is easily the best murder mystery produced in the country in a decade or so.If you decide to skip this, you are probably going to miss one of the best theatrical experiences.",

            "content": "Ratsasan is the new pyscho thriller written and directed by Mundasupatti frame director Ram Kumar. Once again he teamed up with Vishnu Vishal and other supporting actors like Kaali Venkat and Muniskanth from Mundasupatti for an all new spine chilling psycho thriller. It is a complete shift for Director Ram Kumar as the script and screenplay for Mundasupatti is simple, and straight for a laugh out comedy drama whereas, Ratchasan is quite complex in terms of script, content and visual treatment. Pysho-Thriller genre is not very successful in Tamil cinema and very few directors explored this rare genre but Director Ram Kumar put his heart and soul in this film to bring out the best form from his cast and crew. The best thing about this movie is unpredictability. The script and screeplay plays well with the audience mind and make them guessing all the time till the last frame of the climax. Lots of unpredictable twists and turns are framed through out the film to give an all new experience of watching a dark fearful pschoctic thriller. Vishnu Vishal mentally and physically well transformed for his role. Dialogue delivery and body language is perfect for the lead protogonist and Vishnu Vishal gave his full potential to justify the fearless cop character on screen. Director ensured that there is no major logical flaws while investigating the mystery case and at the same time lots of inferences are quoted in different layers of the film to convince the audience. Amala Paul plays the female lead but there is very little scope for her to share the screen space with Vishnu Vishal. Muniskanth and Kaali played their part well to support the investigation process with Vishnu Vishal. All the supporting roles are well connected with the screenplay except Suzanne character. The main cast ' The Pscho Killer' Character was well written and executed on screen. The entire story was scripted around the vilian character and it worked out really well to give the spook shocks for the audience throughout the film. The real hero of this film is Ghibran. He comes up with terrific background score that keeps you horrified and glued to the seat. Once the villian character was revealed to the audience the BGM score was at different worldclass level to give the edge of the seat experience. There are couple of slow romantic tracks which are nice to hear but it is not required for this racey thriller. It does look force fit in the screenplay. Kudos to director for not showing heart broken gory scenes but he frightened the audience with his awesome script. Editing looks neat but the length of the second half is little dragging. Also, flashback scenes look redundant in the second half and not very convincing. Approximately, 15-20 mins of run-time could have been chopped to maintain the gripping experience at high.On the flipside, the make up for the villian character is not upto the mark. It gives an artifitial amateur look for a gruesome serial killer. Suzanne character does look irrelevant for the script but that's the ground reality in the police department. Overall, Ratchasan is a top notch Pscho-Thriller backed up by deadly back ground score from Ghibran. I'm sure it will give you the edge of the seat experience and test your fear factor.\nRating Out of 9.8/10",

I would give the director a 9/10 for his brilliance in the movie making. Kiddos! I would give 7/10 for the acting....while the main lead carried the role very well, I thought he was missing some raw emotions during the car and police station scene. Not sure why but I was thinking of Kamal Hassan in those scenes...his facial expressions and body language would have nailed it. Whilst the actor was probably trying to keep it realistic i.e. police officers being immune to emotions, etc but then again...lets not forget he's a rookie police here and the depth of emotions can be very different when it involves family. And finally for the storyline, I would give a 6/10...considering all the hype and anticipation, the truth once known was expected to be more profounding then it actually was. In short...very-very well done!",

Of course I had no doubt that Sriram Raghavan's Andhadhun will make it to the top spot but I was curious to know the second spot, which went to a Tamil film, Ratsasan. I was so happy to watch this film that immediately I had to write the review to let people know about one the best who-done-it crime-thriller ever made in India.Ratsasan tells the story of an aspiring film-maker, Arun Kumar, who wants to make a psychological thriller film. After being turned down several times, Arun finally decides to become a police officer but little did he know that the information which he collected to make a psychological thriller film, will come in handy to track down a psychopath whose victim is teenage school girls in the city of Chennai.Ratsasan starts off with usual murders taking place in Chennai but gets to the point directly and keeps you engrossed till the actual drama unfolds. Few scenes in in the first half will send the chill down your spine while second half consist of momentum building up and will keep you tensed. There is a scene in the second half which shows a school girl's kidnap situation and how the police react to each and every step. It will definitely keep your mouth wide-open for sometme. But main twist is in the end which is the highlight of the film and you will know who is the main culprit here. The action scene in the climax is superbly executed. Credit goes to the director for handling the thriller quite well. Acknowledgement for screenplay as well. Dialogues are good. Story is awesome.. Hats off to Ramkumar for keeping the audience on the edge of the seat. A big shout to the writers for valuable story while dialogues are superb. Background score is superb making the film more intense. Cinematography is nice catching the essence of Chenna city while art direction is simple.Ratsasan belongs to Vishnu Vishal as he will surprise you with his versatile act. I loved the actor playing the role of Christopher. Other actors were equally good.Overall, a perfect what-will-happen-next thriller to enjoy and break-away from your usual daily routine. Superb 4/5\n1 out of 2 found this helpful.",

The masses love a film with a pounding background music and a little action. But there are also people like me who put the plot and cinematography above in the priority list. And oh boy this film delivers in all forms! Checks all the boxes.I had to deduct two stars because of inaccuracies in the investigative procedures shown in the movie, the plot conveniences and a few cliches, especially during the climax. However, the climax was fantastic to look at and that's what the audience asked for.Overall, a must-watch Tamil film. Especially if you are a fan of Tamil films.",

This movie should be part of the all time greatest Indian psycho thrillers. My only disappointment was they wasted some 15mins overall showing Amala paul Vishnu vishal romance. Actually it wasn't that romantic anyways. That part could have been filled by more thrilling clips. But still I would give 10/10. Purely for the way the storyline was scripted and the BGM.",
