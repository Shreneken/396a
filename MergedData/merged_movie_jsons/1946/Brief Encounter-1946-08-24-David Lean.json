            "content": "Certain songs, or melodies, associated with films one has seen, stay in our sub conscience forever. This is the case with the Rachmaninoff's Second Piano Concerto for this viewer. Any time we hear it, or parts of the main themes are played, it immediately evokes this romantic film of 1945. It's a tribute to its director, David Lean, that after more than sixty years, it still is one of the most cherished movie experiences for a lot of people that saw it, or that are just getting acquainted with it.\"Brief Encounter\" owes it all to one of the best talent in the English speaking world of the last century: Noel Coward. As part of his \"Tonight at Eight\" theater work, this one act play, \"Still Life\" was turned by its author and David Lean into what we know as \"Brief Encounter\", a bittersweet account of two lovers, doomed from the start.The film works because the exquisite chemistry between its two stars, Celia Johnson and Trevor Howard. Both these actors make Laura Jesson and Alec Harvey come alive and stay with us every time we view this timeless film. The story is not far fetched and is made real by the two stars that elevate it to one of the best films of all times. The movie is done with an impeccable sense of decorum and style, yet it has such a sexy subtext. That was a time when a film didn't have to \"bare it all\" in order to catch the viewer's imagination. In fact, Laura and Alec let us know, without being specific, about the passion that both feel for one another.Celia Johnson was not a great beauty. Neither was Trevor Howard the epitome of handsomeness, yet, their scenes together project such a heat, as the one that their characters are feeling at any given moment. The fact the two illicit lovers are played by people one could relate to, is what makes the film resonate the way it does every time we watch it. Of course, we realize this situation had no future from the start, yet, one keeps hoping their love will end well.The supporting cast is excellent. Stanley Holloway is seen as the station master Albert. Joyce Carey is perfect as the woman in charge of the refreshment area of the station where Laura and Alec spend some of their time together. Cyril Raymond makes Fred Jesson, a man who perhaps understand much more than what he lets know. Everly Gregg is seen as the chattering Dolly Messiter.\"Brief Encounter\" is one of the best films directed by David Lean, a man who was able to give the film the right tone and made it the classic that it is.",

She is flustered when a talkative acquaintance runs into them. It's been only a few weeks ago since she met him at the train station. Their friendship turns into longing and finally obsession.Celia Johnson gives a haunted look that speaks to her internal conflict. That is the central issue of the movie.

Celia Johnson and Trevor Howard as the \"ordinary\" lovers were perfect together, and Celia Johnson's monologues were so beautifully written, and flawlessly expressed. Also the depiction of the dull husband was very well done. This movie is important to many, because it tells the tale of doomed love, told beautifully here. There were some parts that I thought I was going to cry. Before I saw this movie, I never appreciated Rachmaninov's 2nd piano concerto as much as I do now. The perfect placement of it, was what made the movie what it is today. The music was the best element of this movie, and reminded me of the beautiful Vocalise by the same composer. You will be moved by this! 10/10. Bethany Cox",

            "content": "There's not a lot to say. Like many classics this film is simply constructed with all the elements in balance so that none stands out. Everything in it contributes something essential; the lighting, the unromantic railway station sets, the minor characters and of course the music, the ultra-romantic Rachmaninov Piano Concerto no 2. The emotional rollercoaster of the illicit affair has seldom been better portrayed. Perhaps it is a little understated for transatlantic tastes but no-one viewing this movie would not appreciate that the English can be as passionate as the rest of us.Celia Johnson as Laura and Trevor Howard as Alec are perfect together. It being 1945, they do not get to bed \u0096 that would have ruined the audience's sympathy for them in those rather more censorious times. It's all in their minds but their faces give the game away \u0096 to each other and to the bystanders. Nothing happens to drag anyone near the awful divorce courts, but you are left wondering whether Celia will ever feel quite the same about her dull, comfortable, patronising and boring husband. As for Alec, he professes he will love her forever but then, he's a man.\nNoel Coward produced this film from a short play of his from 1935 (the war and post-war shortages are absent), and his dulcet tones may be recognised in the railway station announcements. David Lean directed, and it is a remarkable collaboration. The action is opened out a little \u0096 a row on the lake, a drive in the country - but the scenes from the play set entirely in the railway refreshment rooms still remain the centre of the story. The parallel relationship between Albert the station guard (Stanley Holloway), and Myrtle the refreshment room attendant (Joyce Carey), is an interesting counterpoint to the angst-ridden middle class would-be adulterers. Surely Noel old boy you weren't suggesting that the working class handles this sort of thing better? We see things largely from Laura's point of view and perhaps Alec didn't feel quite so guilty, but their consciences are going to make them pay. A gem of a movie.",

            "review_title": "Yes, an affair, but really a tribute to committed married love",
            "content": "YOU CAN SAFELY READ MY INTRO - NO SPOILERS TO STARTI adore this movie, more every time I watch it.First, just a brief introductory summary to whet your appetite for this great picture (my all time favorite), a vintage black and white film set in Britain during the 1940's... During one of her weekly Thursday shopping excursions in a neighboring town, a rather plain (though earnest and engaging), contentedly married, middle aged housewife named Laura encounters an affable and kind (also married) doctor, Alec, at the train station refreshment counter. Circumstances force a brief interaction and thus begins a series of Thursday meetings between the pair, with casual chance acquaintance quickly replaced by growing and consuming attraction. Most of the scenes revolve around the station tea shop which serves as a sort of \"home base\" to the affair. It is Laura's tale; thus the events and emotions are related totally from her point of view, all to the romantic strains of Rachmaninof's Piano Concerto. Read all the other rave reviews about the superb acting / character portrayals, the atmospheric enhancement of the whizzing and hissing trains, and so on. They're all true...plot, character, setting, and atmosphere are all done to perfection in this film. BEWARE - SPOILERS AHEADHowever, if you want a little serious insight into this movie, consider my unique \"take\"....Yes, it's dramatically moving and intense, that farewell touch of Alec's hand on Laura's shoulder. However, I'm probably one of the only viewers who regards this movie as a tribute to married love, as opposed to the middle aged affair between two ordinary people which is its obvious theme. True, the drama revolves around Laura and Alec, their encounters at the train station, their thwarted passions, and their guilt ridden emotions (especially Laura's). But, let's remember, Laura is narrating the tale as she wishes she could tell it to her husband, Fred, obviously her best friend and \"the only one who would understand\".Well, isn't a new romance exciting, the more so if forbidden? Champagne lunches, boat excursions out in the countryside, daydreams of Paris and Venice, hanging on each other's every word. Don't we all sort of yearn for it every now and then? However, if Laura and Alec had remained together, before long they would have resembled...Laura and Fred! The Grand Romance seldom lasts, at least not in its original form; it takes on a more meaningful form. (Failure to realize this of course fills modern divorce courts.) Poor dull Fred! He's my favorite character...I absolutely adore him! He often gets a bad rap from the other reviewers. Don't buy it! Really, there's nothing wrong with him. He probably reminds many a wife of her husband, engrossed with his crossword or whatever. Steady and predictable...the most desirable quality, longterm, in a spouse!Everyone wonders why the movie shows Laura's husband but not Alec's wife, nor does it give us much information about her, other than the fact that she's \"delicate\". That's because Brief Encounter is really the story of Laura and FRED. Even though he's not present in that many scenes, his character is well drawn.Fred may not currently be \"sweeping Laura off her feet\" but he's actually very kind to her. In the end, he realizes she's been having an affair and is grateful she's chosen him. I categorically disagree with those who claim that Laura returns to her husband only because of society's expectations, not out of love for him.What happens after the movie closes? Well, maybe Fred pays her a tiny bit more attention and, hopefully, some spark of romance might be rekindled. As for Laura, I think she'll be extremely relieved that her affair WASN'T consummated, occasionally scold herself for her brief period of insanity, realize the depth of Fred's love, and try to make it up to him for her \"emotional disloyalty\". I doubt Laura will spend too much energy bemoaning what she might have had with Alec; the affair has made clearer to her what she DOES have with Fred.It's \"boring\" (?), stable, committed love versus brief romance and passion. No movie portrays the contrast better than Brief Encounter. Pity more people today don't make the choice Laura and Alec did. The world might be a better place.This movie puts to shame modern cinema where the main characters are generally in bed within the first five minutes. Don't miss it!",

Alec then slowly starts to get these strong feeling about the sweet and somewhat shy, as well as married, middle-age woman that in no time at all turns into an uncontrollable, by both Laura as well as Alec, love affair that in the end if not checked my well break up both of their marriage's.Even though both Alec and Laura are married, not to each other, we only get to see Laura's husband and family in the movie which is shown in a long flashback, that takes up almost the entire film, from only Laura's point of view. After that innocent meeting at the train station the two always end up meeting on a Thursday when Laura travels to Milford to buy groceries and Alec has the afternoon off from work. Alec a doctor at the Milford hospital has a wife and family who we never get to see but sense are very much in love with him. Alec's life starts to take a sudden turn away from them as he starts to slowly fall in love with Laura.You never once get the impression that Alec and Laura are willing to leave their wife and husband so that they can get married to each other. The two star-struck lovers only want to keep their affair secret and live double-lives but the guilt of the affair consumes Laura. For the first time in her marriage Laura lied to her husband Fred, Cyril Raymond, about her being in love with another man. Even though she admitted it to Fred in an almost whimsical way, that Fred took as a joke, Laura also realized that no matter how much she was in love with Alec, and he with her, in the end it would only lead to nothing but heartbreak for her as well as everyone, Alec together with her and his families, involved. It was later when Alec got a job at his brothers new hospital in Johannesburg South Africa that both he and Laura could finally break up their affair by the two never having to as much as cross their paths again. Even saying goodbye to each other for the last time was never to happen when the two were interrupted at the train station by Laura's chatter-house friend Dolly Mesitter, Everly Gregg. Dolly's non-stop talking prevented the two from having the last few minutes together with each other but at the same time also prevented Laura from throwing herself on the tracks, by momentarily keeping her mind off the fact that Alec was about to leave her, as Alec's train left the station. Extremely moving adult drama about two persons who find out only too late in life that they were meant for each other but missed the boat, or train, when it came into the station and have to do with what they have: try to forget they ever met no matter how much sorrow and grief it would bring them. Both Celia Johnson and Trevor Howard were touchingly effective as the star-struck lovers Laura and Alec who knew that their affair was doomed from the start and just had to accept what fate had handed them: try to forget that brief encounter they had one fateful evening in the railroad station outside of Milford.",

Part of the enjoyment was the style of writing and acting that is purposely theatrical in order for the 1940s British subject matter to be handled in the fairly explicit way that it was. For those who 'don't get it' or find it boring well what can those who do 'get it' say? How sad perhaps that something so lovely and so humane and so complex in its dialogue and beautifully formal in its British tone cannot be enjoyed by a few who demand ..DEMAND.. it suit them in 2009. Hilarious! Maybe the multiplex mind thought BRIEF ENCOUNTER was about colliding underpants, which just might be right for them. CLASH OF THE TIGHT'UNS anyone? Maybe a remake with Adam Sandler and Drew Barrymore called HERE/NOW might be the right update. This gloriously stuffy and furtive Noel Coward play is transformed in this film to be the black and white smoky British damp equivalent of HUMORESQUE or NOW VOYAGER.. and if you love those films (so easy!) you will love this.",

            "content": "Brief Encounter was written by Noel Coward and directed by David Lean.The snobbish Coward was gay and Lean had married multiple times during his life. Here was a film made by contrasting personalities.The movie is all about middle class restraint. It might be to do with the film censorship of the time or not to offend its audience. After all this is a romantic drama about nice people and middle class mores.Laura Jesson (Celia Johnson) meets Dr Alec Harvey (Trevor Howard) in a cafe at a railway station. She has some grit in her eye and he removes it with his handkerchief.They then sit and chat to each other. Both are seemingly happily married and have children. When Laura gets up to catch her train, Alec impulsively asks to meet again.They do meet, have lunch, go to a cinema, walks in the country.Told in flashback by Laura, her desire and longing for Alec only gets more intense. Enough for them to take risks. A discreet visit to an apartment owned by Alec's friend.Brief Encounter is a simple movie that is rooted to its time. Lean disguises the simplicity. Laura's and Alec's increasing serious relationship is in contrast with the more comic tone of the station master Albert and the cafe manageress Myrtle. The latter are more working class and flirt rather openly. Laura and Alec try to keep everything discreet.This is a genteel romantic drama. People talked in clipped tones. It hides a lot of passion underneath and this is highlighted in Laura's narration. There is desperation when their final goodbye is interrupted.Brief Encounter would not work today. There have been attempts to do something similar. Falling in Love starring Robert De Niro and Meryl Streep had similar themes.",

            "content": "How many times have you been caught in a love triangle in the middle of a civil war while you lose your plantation home? How many times have you wandered into a bar in Morocco and gotten caught up in a lost love who is now married to a resistance fighter? If your answer is anything more than zero, then what the heck are you doing watching movies. \"Brief Encounter\" is a 1945 British film that shook the world of romance because the story is essentially so boring that real people immediately felt it in the core of their hearts. And 75 years later, I'm willing to bet that it'll grip you the same way.Plot summary: two strangers meet briefly on a railway platform and soon realize that they are both there every Thursday at the same time. Over the course of several Thursdays, recognition becomes familiarity, familiarity becomes friendship, friendship eventually becomes love. But the problem is that they are both taken.THIS, my romantic friends, is how love happens in the real world. It's not planned, not necessarily elegant, and in most cases it's not opportune. In a word, it's imperfect. The power of this film lies in the way this theme is brought to life. We are immersed in a world of mundane details. We eavesdrop on random conversations at the railway station, miniature dramas of everyday life, until we settle on the 2 protagonists and become interested in their story. The camera continues to remind us of how ordinary the world is, taking detours to sideshows and unrelated plots involving nonessential characters. But it's not boring because we know that this is how real life works. And before you know it, you are swallowed up in this world as if it's your own.\"Brief Encounter\" is the sort of film that can make you feel like you're falling in love even if you've never been in love. Or it can remind you of that \"what if\" scenario you left in your own past. Excellent cinematography and lighting, along with the excellent acting, are icing on the cake. If you want to feel--or remember--what love is like, then this is your ticket.",

            "content": "'Brief Encounter' grabs you from the start, with a chatterbox interrupting a man and a woman who are silently sitting together in the caf\u00e9 of a train station, but were clearly in the middle of a conversation before she arrived. When the man (Trevor Howard) eventually departs politely for his train, he presses the shoulder of the woman (Celia Johnson) and slips out through the door. She then takes the train with her friend, who continues to talk incessantly despite her obvious signs of grief. It's at this point that director David Lean first brilliantly utilizes an interior monologue in the mind of the woman. This leads to these fantastic lines:\"This can't last. This misery can't last. I must remember that and try to control myself. Nothing lasts really. Neither happiness nor despair. Not even life lasts very long. There'll come a time in the future when I shan't mind about this anymore, when I can look back and say quite peacefully and cheerfully 'how silly I was'. No, no, I don't want that time to come ever. I want to remember every minute, always, always to the end of my days.\"I was hooked from then on, and the film never let up. Based on a play by Noel Coward, it's very well written, and very well executed. The British production has an intelligent, indie feel to it, it's without major stars, and has nothing resembling the fanfare typical of Hollywood movies at the time. Rachmaninoff's Piano Concerto No. 2 provides a fantastic score, with dramatic moments, and following the ebb and flow of emotions perfectly. As you can probably guess, the pair are involved in forbidden love. After returning home to her kind but somewhat boring husband, who takes more interest in crossword puzzles than in her, she recounts the past, starting again with a brilliant bit of us listening in to her thoughts:\"Fred, dear Fred. There's so much that I want to say to you. You're the only one in the world with enough wisdom and gentleness to understand. If only it was somebody else's story and not mine. As it is, you're the only one in the world that I can never tell. Never never. Because even if I waited until we were old, old people and told you then, you'd be bound to look back over the years and be hurt. And my dear, I don't want you to be hurt. You see, we're a happily married couple and let's never forget that. This is my home. You're my husband. And my children are upstairs in bed. I'm a happily married woman - or I was, rather, until a few weeks ago. This is my whole world, and it's enough, or rather, it was until a few weeks ago. But, oh, Fred, I've been so foolish. I've fallen in love. I'm an ordinary woman. I didn't think such violent things could happen to ordinary people.\"In telling the story, the film captures what it's like to feel yourself slowly but inexorably drawn to another person, even while knowing it's wrong, feeling guilt, and telling yourself that it can't go on. Those early innocent moments lead to those with the subtlest of sparks, and soon the two are on each other's minds throughout the week, until they might meet again each Thursday. It's honest, and far from tawdry. The pair simply fall in love, and as he puts it, \"It's no use pretending that it hasn't happened because it has.\" It's romantic, and heartbreaking at the same time.Lean gives us several fantastic scenes on the railway platform. I also loved the one with Johnson running down the street in the rain, and another with the camera twisting to an angle as it slowly zooms in on her face when he's left. The inclusion of the relationship between an older caf\u00e9 owner (Joyce Carey) and a night watchman (Stanley Holloway) is playful and fun, and helps provide a counterpoint to the main story. There is a lot to love here, including a powerful ending.",

The movie works through subtlety, both in the subtlety of the performances and in the subtlety of the actors in the roles.

            "content": "Long before he made his grand widescreen epics, master director David Lean made small, intimate films about normal people who find themselves outside of their comfort zones. His most famous of these early works - and arguably the gold standard by which all ill-fated love stories are compared - is this 86-minute treasure from 1946. It is the rather simple story of a chance meeting between housewife Laura Jesson and Dr. Alec Harvey in the refreshment room of a suburban London train station. The plot starts innocently enough when Alec removes some smut from Laura's eye, but then they inevitable become drawn to each other and fall in love.Lean employs a flashback technique to tell the story (penned by Noel Coward along with Lean and Anthony Havelock-Allan) and actually begins with the quiet farewell between Laura and Alec. From there, Laura recalls the entire story, narrating in a breathless and at times frantic voice-over. Watching the events unfold in her memory and listening to her narration, we are drawn completely into her mind as Rachmaninoff's Second Piano Concerto floods the soundtrack. Despite their respective marital statuses, the two begin to fall in love and soon enough, romance and even lust (at least in typically stiff upper-lip British form) have shown up on the scene. After a while, they start to meet on a very regular basis and though both know it will never work, they still spend time together.Leave it to Lean to transcend the tendency to produce a predictably romantic and masochistic wallow and come up with a more complex set of conflicting emotions. Probably because Laura's narration is so honest and involving, this movie resonates far more than a more Baroque \"chick flick\" like Irving Rapper's \"Now, Voyager\" or Jean Negulesco's \"Humoresque\". Granite-jawed Trevor Howard portrays Alec with sympathy and unapologetic yearning, but it's Celia Johnson who galvanizes the film with a multi-layered performance as she makes Laura's desperation palpable but never off-putting. With her saucer eyes and emotionally pinched demeanor, she truly brings a genuine soul to this vulnerable, emotionally closeted woman who is unable to come to terms with her unconsummated affair. Providing just the right amount of comic relief are Joyce Carey as the haughty refreshment room hostess and Stanley Holloway (well before his ne'er-do-well Alfred Doolittle in \"My Fair Lady\") as the persistent train station attendant who constantly flirts with her.Criterion has once again done a superb job in bringing this movie to life as the pristine print really brings out Robert Krasker's crisp cinematography. Film historian Bruce Eder provides informative audio commentary on an alternate track and goes in-depth into not only the production but also the careers of Lean, Coward and all the actors with speaking parts. Beyond that, there is the original trailer and an interesting demonstration of the restoration process. If you have seen Claude Lelouch's \"A Man and a Woman\" (with Anouk Aim\u00e9e and Jean-Louis Trintignant) or Ulu Grosbard's \"Falling in Love\" (with Robert DeNiro and Meryl Streep) or Richard Linklater's \"Before Sunrise\" (with Ethan Hawke and Julie Delpy) or Sofia Coppola's \"Lost in Translation\" (with Bill Murray and Scarlett Johansson)....you owe yourself to see the original inspiration.",

            "content": "Have you really never seen Brief Encounter? What have you been doing all these years? You have a treat in store.I have a great love for British films of the 1940s. There seems to have been a great flowering of creative talent then, and the films of the period look beautiful, and have such wonderful characters in them. David Lean is more famous for his huge Technicolor epics, like Lawrence of Arabia, or A Passage to India, but Brief Encounter is his most moving film. It is shot in atmospheric black and white, and tells the story of two people who fall in love, in mundane little England.Celia Johnston plays Laura, a middle class woman who lives a happy but predictable life, who meets Dr. Alec Harvey, played by craggy Trevor Howard. There starts a doomed love affair, set to the sweeping romantic sounds of Rachmaninov's 2nd piano concerto. This single piece of music plays throughout the film, and stirs up exactly the right emotions. The film will make you want to own a recording of the music.Such is the power and influence of this film, that it has been remade a few times, and spoofed on countless occasions. It created the archetype for the romantic farewell on a station platform, with steam hissing from trains, and an orchestra playing in the background. Though this has been copied often, it has never been bettered. The film involves a few scenes on railway platforms, and some of these are mundane, others joyous, or despairing, wretched. The director uses many deft tricks to heighten the emotion all along the way. A simple tilt of the camera, or contrasting mood of another character, serves to add tremendous power to the emotion of the scenes.Times were different then. People were brasher, accents were stronger, and social attitudes to affairs quite different. The period of the film gives it much of its charm. It does not make it a cold study of a different culture, however. The film is very personal. The character of Laura's husband is hardly seen in the entire film, which means that we identify more with Laura's feelings. We see the affair and next to nothing else.Celia Johnson brings a great deal to the film. She is so likeable, and so able to express the misery that her new love brings her. Her manner of speaking is quite alien to a modern ear. In the 1940s, it was quite normal to add a Y sound to many words. \"Hat\" became \"hyat\". The accents are not forced, though - they come across as quite natural, and very likeable.This film would not be made this way today. The modern audience would demand younger stars, and nudity. See this film to witness how it was once possible to make films about love without bedroom scenes. Brief Encounter is very much stronger for lack of these. Stoicism and restraint are under-rated traits in modern cinema. Modern directors and writers would do well to remind themselves with this film, that a story can be given tremendous emotional power by techniques which seem to have been lost.",

            "content": "Steam ... cut-glass accents ... Rachmaninov's 2nd Piano Concerto ... the refreshment room at Milford Junction ... \"the shame of the whole thing - the guiltiness, the fear ...\" - it all adds up to David Lean's famous film treatment of the Noel Coward tale of love blossoming and withering at a suburban railway station.  Laura Jesson is a complacent middle-class housewife who gets a piece of grit in her eye one day and is helped by Doctor Alec Harvey, and the romance begins.     Coward's screenplay is characteristic of his oeuvre.  There is the neat precision of the circular plot, beginning and ending with the brainless intrusion of Dolly Messiter, and the matching sub-plot of the Albert-Mrs. Bagot courtship.  There are tongue-in-cheek self-references (on the cinema screen, \"Flames Of Passion\" coming shortly) and the trademark Cowardian grounding in exaggerated Englishness (\"One has one's roots, after all\"). Most typical of all is that overwrought cascade of middle-class vocabulary (\" ...so utterly humiliated and defeated, and so dreadfully, dreadfully ashamed\").  Coward patronises working-class people abominably.  Albert and Mrs. Bagot amble effortlessly through their romance because, bless them, they are simple folk.  Alec and Laura suffer torments, having so much more sensitivity, and, you see, they have reputations to lose (\"the furtiveness and the lying outweigh the happiness\").     Having made the transition from editor to director in 1942, Lean was at the helm for the fourth time for \"Brief Encounter\", all four films being Coward projects - and a highly creditable job he made of this one.  The scene in which Alec explains coal-dust inhalation and Laura falls in love is a model of sensitive direction.  Reflections of Laura's face in the train window and the make-up mirror suggest in visual terms the existence of her 'other self', the id to her ego.  Thundering steam trains and Rachmaninov stand for the irrepressible sexual urge.  Stephen Lynn's flat, with its bachelor urbanity, contrasts cleverly with Laura's safe, staid home and safe, staid husband Fred (\"I don't understand!\")  Alec's silent hand on Laura's shoulder is wonderfully poignant, the suppressed emotion eclipsed by stupid Dolly Messiter, her face filling the screen and 'wiping out' the great moment.     Sex has to be dealt with obliquely, but it is very much the driving-force of the film.  \"If we control ourselves, and behave like sensible human beings ...\" offers Laura hopefully but hollowly.  Neither man nor woman is capable of restraint, at least until after the climax in Stephen's flat.  The boathouse and the little bridge hint furtively at sexual union.  Other reviewers have declared the liaison to be 'unrequited' or 'unconsummated', but I am not so sure.  In the grammar of 1940's cinema, the return to the love-nest of tousle-haired, hatless Laura is the equivalent, I would suggest, of our modern bedroom scene.  Isn't that why Alec suddenly decides to take the job offer?",

            "content": "Two people meet in a train station and have a \"Brief Encounter\" in the 1946 film directed by David Lean, based on Noel Coward's beautiful story of love found and love lost. There is much talk of a negative first review on this site; I confess I didn't read it.Celia Johnson plays a married woman, Laura, who once a week goes into town to shop and see a movie; Trevor Howard is a married doctor, Alec, who helps a friend out one day at a week at a nearby clinic. The two meet while waiting for their trains, the assignations becoming more and more important to each, until they realize they've fallen in love. This is the 1940s in Britain, and there's no decision to be made.This is a very famous movie, and I can still remember the scene in \"Touch of Class\" as Glenda Jackson and George Segal cry over it. That's far from the only film in which \"Brief Encounter\" is referenced: there's also 84 Charing Cross Road, Truly Madly Deeply, The Heidi Chronicles, The Care and Handling of Roses, The Mirror Has Two Faces, and many others. And with good reason. It's a tender love story about two good people who have probably never hurt anyone in their lives and find themselves in a precarious situation.The story begins at the end, before the audience realizes what is going on when a chattering friend of Laura's (Johnson) joins her and Dr. Alec Harvey (Howard) in the caf\u00e9. Just then Harvey's train is called and he rushes off. Laura looks stunned. Her narration begins, continuing on the train and once at home as she, in her mind, tells her husband the story of her relationship with Alex, how they met quite by chance. Then he went with her to the movies. Before long, she was meeting him on Thursdays outside the hospital. Laura is riddled with guilt and finds herself lying to her husband (Cyril Raymond). We don't get the impression that Harvey is feeling equally guilty; in fact, one gets the impression that he would do anything to be with Laura. However, in the end, he takes drastic measures not to be with her.Was the affair consummated or not? Nowadays, with email relationships going on, we know there's such a thing as emotional infidelity, and these two are definitely guilty of that. Physical? I have to agree that it's unclear. They have their special places - the bridge, the boathouse...it's up to the viewer. But Alec's decision certainly hints that something went on.Johnson and Howard weren't beautiful Hollywood stars, which lends realism to the film. They were both attractive, Johnson with her huge eyes and Howard with his chiseled features. (Johnson, by the way, was the sister-in-law of Ian Fleming, and her children purchased the rights to his books.) Laura's marriage is conveyed realistically as well - not unhappy, but not really exciting either. Yet she knows her husband is a good man. He gets the last line in the film, and it's one of its most beautiful moments. Perhaps they will come together as they once did and appreciate one another all the more.The film is scored with the music of Rachmaninoff - maybe it's a little too much at times, but at other times, it's achingly beautiful. The moment when Alec places his hand on Laura's shoulder as he leaves is one of the great moments in film, and a testament to the fact that love doesn't have to be shown using obvious sexual scenes, only with the use of some imagination.Despite \"Brief Encounter\" being dated today, it serves as a strong metaphor for post-war Britain. During the war, both men and women experienced more freedom from class and social restrictions than they ever had, but afterward, things returned to their conventional ways. It was a hard adjustment for many. \"Brief Encounter\" shows what happened to two people bound by the mores of the times.",

            "content": "David Lean's 'Brief Encounter' was criticized when it was first released for being 'more like a French film'. Yes, that statement rings true, but 'Brief Encounter' is all the better for it's low-key, minimalist approach. It feels REAL.The subject matter was scandalous for a film made in the 40's; primarily because the two parties involved in the affair were portrayed so sympathetically. Of course, this tale of illicit love will barely raise an eyebrow of outrage from modern film-goers, we've 'Been there, seen that'. Although no longer shocking in content, this film is still very powerful because of the deeply felt emotional states of the two characters, Alec and Laura.Celia Johnson and Trevor Howard are perfectly cast as the ordinary housewife and married doctor. Johnson has more share of the action, as it is through her character that we view the pair's infidelity (achieved through flashback & voice-over). The pair are not glamorous or showy stars, so they are utterly believable in their roles as the ordinary, lovestruck Britons. Johnson's soulful eyes and capacity for displaying emotion is brilliantly used here; we, the viewer, feel her repulsion and disgust at what she has allowed to happen- 'I felt like a criminal'- but feel her torment, too. Howard is occasionally stiff, but still very, very good as the doctor who meets Johnson after she gets a piece of grit stuck in her eye. Alec, like Laura, is painfully aware of their situation, yet he is much more boyish and romantic- Indeed, when Alec talks about his desires to further himself in the field of medicine, Laura remarks 'You looked like a little boy, just then'.Every 'brief encounter' between the pair has that sense of urgency, desperation. The constant use of trains and the Rachmaninoff music is symbolic of their restrained inner desires, as are the films playing when the two meet together (every Thursday) to attend the cinema. The use of shadows and lighting (exemplified when Howard kisses Johnson passionately in the shadows at the train station as an engine blows)are terrific. Lean's direction is wonderful, every scene is beautifully handled.Amazing film.10/10.",

(No 'just' about it!)It functions equally well on whatever other level the viewer wishes it to. Knowing that Noel Coward played the male lead in the original 1936 West End production of his own play adds an obvious gay subtext to its tale of forbidden love; while despite being set before the war (the copyright date on 'Flames of Passion' is 1938) looks thoroughly wartime (especially Celia Johnson's chic, pre-New Look suit) and must have struck a chord with lonely wartime wives tempted to stray while their husbands were away on active service.Now comes the moment where I must declare my own interest. I find Celia Johnson quite breathtakingly lovely and heartbreakingly moving at the core of the film, she looks terrific in that suit, and I could spend all day just looking into those big, sad, imploring eyes of hers...",

            "content": "Irrevocably putting UK maestro David Lean on the international map of a rising future cinematic titan, continuing his auspicious collaborations with famed playwright No\u00ebl Coward, BRIEF ENCOUNTER has surmounted itself at the apogee of film romanticism ever since. Based on Coward's one-act play, it is a garden-variaty extramarital affair between Laura Jesson (Johnson), a middle-class housewife and Alec Harvey (Howard), a married doctor. The film starts in the refreshment tea room of Milford Junction Station, a recurring place where they part ways after their weekly assignations, which also bookends from their first chance meeting to the ultimate farewell, but Lean cunningly leaves them in the periphery of his frame in the opening introduction, the initial perspective is of a gabby interloper Ms. Dolly Messiter (Gregg), an acquaintance of Laura, with whom she shares the same train route. Ms. Messiter's intrusion noticeably throws the pair for a loop, but Alec manages to retain his courtesy until his train arrives, and leaves Laura in an almost catatonic state, even the obtuse Ms. Messiter can tell there is something amiss about her, only if she would know, she has inconveniently obtruded herself into their last goodbye. After returning to her suburban residence, the voiceover of a distraught Laura begins to enunciate their weekly encounters from stem to stern, at once mundanely amicable and irresistibly intimate. Hence, the story is exclusively told from Laura's viewpoint, and Celia Johnson's extraordinary performance is nonpareil in its acute caliber and immense empathy, it sweeps all over you like a cataract ever since the very first gaze she projects in a close-up, which is so galvanizing that we are rapt in anticipation of its seething undertow's unfolding, and she pampers us with the full treatment, playing out against a cordial and debonair Trevor Howard, who has his own challenge to live up to Johnson's standard in less ample allotment in terms of screen time and backstory, and leaves a sterling impression as an idealist, upstanding, charming man, makes for an emphatically conflicted dyad with Johnson enmeshed in the moral quagmire, and together they elevate the material onto a situationist slant that entirely shucking off their personal liabilities from homily: it can happen to anyone, and when it happens, no one can afford an easy escape, more pertinently, in Laura's imaginative vignettes, Lean's film rams home that this luxury of living one's dreamed life is an everyday illusion that individuality is practically irrelevant, an inevitable temptation those who encounter must cope with wisely, touch wood! Plumping for Rachmaninoff's Second Piano Concerto as the film's thematic signifier, Mr. Lean also constructs every shot with fluid nicety and supreme lighting in sharpening the focus on its romantic mythos and the characters' torrid inscape, and cleanses any blemish of vulgarity from the seemingly indiscreet situation, this is a film very close to perfection by this reviewer's lights, and hopefully yours too.",

            "content": "David Lean's great masterpiece has slipped in and out of fashion over the years and since it deals with so much that is mundane and is so terribly, terribly British it was inevitable that it would be lampooned mercilessly. Yet few films have struck the kind of emotional chord with audiences as this one has. Although it deals with a milieu that is regimentally insular and with characters whose very ordinariness strikes you as somewhat peculiar, it has a universal appeal. Who isn't susceptible to a chance encounter with someone who, perhaps only for an instant, appears more handsome, more exciting than anyone or anything else in our lives. Innocence isn't an excuse and feelings are everything.Laura Jesson's idyll with the handsome doctor she meets on a station platform is hopelessly romantic because it is so innocent and so inconsequential. What Laura and Alec feel for each other transcends the drabness of their lives and their surroundings and creates possibilities that in the everyday we can only dream of. Of course, one reading is that of gay wish-fulfillment; the impossibility of the central conceit and as Laura says 'the shame of the whole thing, the deceit, the fear', something Coward would have been well aware of as a gay man in the 1940's, dreaming of the perfect partner outside of the constraints of society. It's only one reading, naturally but it can't explain the film's universal popularity. Love, not sex, has no boundaries.It's magnificently made. Lean uses only a few sets and locations. It's as if Laura and Alec are caged in by their surroundings and their emotions and can never escape the shabby tea-rooms and cinemas where they meet. Yet Robert Kraser's luminous black-and-white cinematography keeps adding a dimension to proceedings as if the shadows thrown up only serve to heighten the protagonist's guilt. And as Laura and Alec, Celia Johnson and Trevor Howard were never better. Indeed Johnson gives one of the cinema's great performances; the simple mundane words and actions stand in complete contrast to the naked emotionality on display. If the film is heartbreaking it is Johnson who breaks your heart. Today we may feel smugly sophisticated and think of films like \"Brief Encounter\" as 'old-fashioned'. If we do, then the loss is ours. \"Brief Encounter\" may never again make the lists of time best films yet it will always remain a timeless classic.",

Lean had great problems with intimacy, and much preferred grandeur (he virtually abandoned his son, and didn't meet one of his grandchildren until she was about 30). I'm not knocking the epics, because I've enjoyed them as well, but at the end of LAWRENCE OF ARABIA one knows about as much about Lawrence as one did about 3-1/2 hours earlier. ..unlike Alec and Laura in this film, whom we know very well after 1-1/2 hours, or Pip and Miss Havisham in EXPECTATIONS, characters who leapt off the screen and endeared themselves to us (it also helped that some really gifted actors & actresses played these roles).I never tire of BRIEF ENCOUNTER - it's one of the screen's great romances, perhaps because it doesn't quite end \"happily ever after\".

But when she meets a doctor (Trevor Howard), the possibility of something new arises.Robert Krasker's* cinematography tells the story almost as much as the acting. There's a stark contrast between the flowery, optimistic look of Celia's and Alec's day on the rowboat, and the dreary, hopeless look of Celia's wandering through the city towards the end. The movie makes it clear that even though Celia and Alec have a good relationship, their love simply can't be. This becomes especially clear when Celia waits a long time for him in the train station's refreshment room, but he never returns.I haven't seen all of David Lean's movies, but I'd actually say that this one is better than his most famous ones (which tended to glamorize their topics). It's a movie that I recommend to everyone. This and \"I Know Where I'm Going\" were probably the best British movies of 1945.

The immediate post-WW 2 era in the UK was a period that saw Brits struggling with the disppearance of traditional social mores that had endured for over a century and the new world order that came about at the conclusion of the war.  (For another, beautifully crafted cinematic example, see Neil Jordan's exquisite movie \"The End of the Affair.\")Food rationing was still in place in postwar Britain.  Women were having to deal with getting to know their menfolk again, after their years of absence at war. Like their American \"Rosie the Riveter\" counterparts, British women had enjoyed newfound and unfamiliar independence during wartime, working for the war effort.  And, like their US \"sisters\", they were expected to relinquish those jobs to returning men.\"Brief Encounter\" is, in many ways, a metaphor for the struggle that men and women were going through, stuck with having to conform to social expectations while bursting to escape to the greater independence glimpsed fleetingly and pleasurably during the war, when everything and everyone were turned upside down.Being the work of Noel Coward, that master observer of and commentator on English manners, \"Brief Encounter\" frames this struggle as a torrid love story bubbling under the surface of British reserve, which demands maintaining appearances at all costs, regardless of the personal pain involved.This passionate pair, who never even exchange a kiss, are constrained and ultimately kept apart by expectations--of their families, of their social positions, of Great Britain.When Alec puts his hand on Laura's shoulder at their final, unexpectedly truncated meeting in the station snack bar/waiting room, it's as erotic and far more touching than just about every sex scene you'll see in movies.The first reviewer completely missed the point and the relevance of this movie in film history and, especially, in British cinema history.",

To have their performances for posterity.Brief Encounter was an expanded version of a small one act play that takes place entirely within a railroad station. Two middle-aged people meet quite by chance in a railway station, he a doctor, she a homemaker and without either intending it, fall in love.Because the whole thing is narrated in flashback from Celia Johnson's point of view we get a whole lot more of her in it. But Trevor Howard does get his innings in. My favorite scene in the film is how he describes his wish to go to Africa and teach preventive medicine for various tropical ailments. His voice filled with idealism and I think it's right then and there that Celia falls for him. You can see it in her reactions shots.We don't see Trevor's wife. My guess is that she's not terribly supportive. We do see Celia's husband, a nice man, kind, but terribly dull. My favorite of the supporting performances is Valentine Dyall who plays Howard's friend who's a real creep, but allows his apartment to be used for their trysts.Brief Encounter made both the leads international stars. Celia got an Oscar nomination for 1946 which was when Brief Encounter made it to American cinema, but lost to Olivia DeHavilland. Laurence Olivier's Henry V was also making its American debut that year which was why he was up as well in the male player category.As good as the leads are, and as good as the film David Lean directed is, Noel Coward wrote this for himself and Gertrude Lawrence and what a treat it would have been to see them.",

To anyone under 50 who lacks a degree in or a highly developed passion for Social History the social landscape against which the story plays out will appear all but incomprehensible, as remote from the world of today as Atlantis. Over 50s on the other hand will navigate effortlessly via such long forgotten landmarks as lunch at the Kardomah, tea at Fuller's and in between a trip to Boot's Lending Library. In common with Andy Hardy's Carvel the Milford Junction of Laura and Alec is an idealized concept that fits the real world where it touches. This leaves the story and the name of Noel Coward, who adapted his own one-act play 'Still Life' for the screen should tell us all we need to know. Coward, in common with Terence Rattigan and Arthur Miller, was above all a craftsman (not for nothing did Arthur Miller spend his spare time making furniture) and were this a piece of furniture and not a piece of celluloid it would be a Louis X1V commode - I speak as one whose own furniture goes back to Louis the fourteenth; I don't pay by the fourteenth it goes straight back to Louis, but that's another story. In many cases films that began life in the theater don't 'open out' well but this is at least one exception to the rule. Although Coward wrote an extremely 'tight' one-acter set entirely in the buffet of a railway station he has constructed skilfully 'extra' scenes set in a tea room, a boating lake, a hut by the lake, a cinema, a 'borrowed' flat and Laura's home to say nothing of creating extra characters, not least Laura's husband (Cyril Raymond and Alec's 'friend' (an uncredited Valentine Dyall). Howard, who actually began his career in comedy (Terence Rattigan's French Without Tears) is now much better known for his 'rugged' military types but though Celia Johnson was an equally accomplished actress and scored heavily as the cockney wife in Coward's own 'This Happy Breed' she scored equally highly as Coward's upper-class screen wife in 'In Which We Serve' and never really strayed far from Laura Jesson, solid, dependable, quietly attractive, perfect 'wife and mother' material. The acting throughout is almost beyond praise and it seems somehow anachronistic to watch it on DVD via a plasma screen with surround sound which makes Alec and Laura seem so far away they might as well be dwelling in caves as Mock-Tudor semis in a world full of Acacia Avenues. The real way to watch it is surely at the local Odeon where you could enter halfway through Reel #4 and leave at exactly the same place three and a half hours later having seen in the interim one 'B' picture, one newsreel, one cartoon, plus the 'trailer' for next week's film, possibly Basil Dearden's 'Frieda' (1947) set in an identical 'Neverland' in the Home Counties.

            "content": "Like many film buffs, I am often surprised when a film director wins the \"Best Director\" award at the Oscars or some other ceremony and yet the film itself is denied \"Best Picture\". Re-watching \"Brief Encounter\" recently helped me to understand how such a thing might be possible. There is no doubt that it is a superbly directed film and that David Lean's \"Best Director\" Oscar nomination was well-deserved. Nevertheless, I have never been convinced by the arguments of those who would claim the film as a great classic of the British cinema.This was Lean's fourth film, and like his first three (\"In Which We Serve\", \"This Happy Breed\" and \"Blithe Spirit\") was based upon a work by No\u00ebl Coward, who adapted the screenplay from his one-act play \"Still Life\". It tells the story of the relationship (the \"brief encounter\" of the title) between Laura Jesson, a middle-class housewife, and Alec Harvey, a doctor. The two meet at a railway station while she is returning from a shopping excursion to a nearby town, and arrange to meet again. They quickly become friends and then fall in love. Although their relationship is never consummated (the censors were insistent on this point), they come to care deeply for one another and make plans for a life together. Both, however, are married with two children, and although divorce was legally possible in the Britain of the forties, it was very much frowned upon by social convention. The story is narrated by Laura in the first person, imagining that she is confessing her affair to her husband Fred.Many people assume that the action takes place in Home Counties suburbia, and certainly the accents (either Received Pronunciation or Cockney) are suggestive of south-east England. Only one character, a policeman who appears briefly, has a northern accent. Other factors, however, do suggest a northern location, notably Alec's reference to coal mines in the vicinity, the initials LMS (London, Midland and Scottish Railway) on the railway carriages and the rugged scenery in the countryside scenes. Finally, the matter is settled when we see references to cities such as Leeds, Bradford and Lancaster on the destination boards on the station platform. (These scenes were actually shot at Carnforth station in Lancashire).The whole of Coward's play is set in the station refreshment room. Although Lean does open the film up by introducing other settings, such as Laura's home or a cinema, many of the key scenes still take place at the station, and it is in these scenes that Lean shows his gifts as a director to their best advantage. The black-and-white photography of the steam trains is particularly striking and takes on a symbolic quality; constantly in motion, rapidly arriving and departing, they seem to stand for the rapidity of change in human affairs, and in particular the rapidity with which the romance of Laura and Alec develops and then come to an end. These scenes have become even more evocative ever since the steam locomotive ceased to be an everyday means of transport and became a potent symbol of nostalgia.\"Brief Encounter \" may have been beautifully photographed, but I was less enthusiastic about either the writing or the acting, both of which are characterised by a deadening emotional reticence which does not sit well with either Lean's dramatic direction or the use on the soundtrack of that supremely romantic piece of music, Sergei Rachmaninoff's Piano Concerto No. 2. This is supposed to be the story of an all-consuming, albeit unconsummated, passion, but one would not think so to judge from Coward's script. Coward's greatest gift as a writer was his mordant wit, which he could put to good use in his comedies, but his attempts to write serious drama could often seem artificial and mannered, the sort of drawing-room theatre which in the next decade was to be so angrily rejected by the Angry Young Men.Nor would one think so from the well-mannered gentility with which Celia Johnson and Trevor Howard mouth their lines. For all their talk of love and desire, I was never convinced that either of them really felt the emotions they were talking about. Even during her lifetime Johnson was regarded as something of a national treasure by an older generation of film-lovers, but I always found her cut-glass accent grating, an early case of Irritating Vowel Syndrome. In this film she sounds more like an aristocrat than any Lancashire housewife (or even London housewife) I have ever heard.We never see Mrs Harvey, so never learn why Alec was dissatisfied with his existing marriage, but in Laura's case we are supposed to infer that she finds Fred dull, although he is caring and affectionate. Unfortunately, Alec, although idealistic, does not come across as being any more exciting than Cyril Raymond's Fred. Trevor Howard never suggests that if Laura were to leave her husband for him she would be doing any more than exchanging one stolid bourgeois suburbanite for another. (It does not help that, although Howard was only 32 at the time, he looked considerably older). Howard was to give some great performances in films like \"The Third Man\", but this is not one of them.One criticism made of the film is that it is \"dated\", by which is normally meant that attitudes towards sex have changed since the forties. It is certainly true that divorce does not carry the stigma that it did seventy years ago, but there is still a widely held view that adultery is immoral and many modern viewers will still sympathise with Laura and Alec's decision to put their families and their marriages before their love for one another. The problem is that neither Coward, Johnson nor Howard are able to persuade us that this decision really involved any great sacrifice. Lean does his best, but steam trains and Rachmaninoff can only take you so far. 7/10",

            "content": "It's not difficult to see why one who only really knows David Lean from 1957 onward - from River Kwai onward he seemed to only make lush, epic films of romance and adventure, only four to be exact - to come to a film like Brief Encounter. Of course Lean made other films, like Dickens adaptations, but this is so very intimate, mostly about two characters (maybe two other ones are supporting, but that's it) and the relationship they have, an emotional affair that never really, far as we can see, develop into sex. But Lean was at his best when he made his epics intimate, when it was just about two characters in a room or a place trying to figure things out - those are the scenes that made Kwai and Lawrence so compelling, was taking the high stakes of human beings amid the large vistas. Here, the locations are set in gloomy old England, immediately post-war, and is simply about two adults - Celia Johnson as Laura and Trevor Howard as Alex - who know they've made a connection, and know they have to move on. How can they? One of those tremendously dramatic scenes in films, the kind that one may take for granted, happens not too soon after the film begins. We see the couple together about to separate - for good, it seems - as the sort of \"End at the beginning\" style of non-linear storytelling. At a caf\u00e9 one of Laura's friends, played by Everly Gregg, comes in and won't.. stop.. talking. A stream of words, perfectly friendly, but without any shred of a sense of what's going on in front of her unless it's spelled out. The two women get on the train after the couple separates, and she continues to talk. Laura narrates, but it's more about the immediate thoughts in her head, as Lean cuts between close-ups of Gregg's non-stop mouth, and Johnson's face, sullen, distant, and her thoughts shift between \"I wish you were dead. No, that is wrong, I didn't mean that. But I wish you would stop talking.\" It's one of those moments that made me sit up and take notice. Brief Encounter isn't about to make these characters, just because they're in their 30's (verging on 40's) with marriages and kids, not have thoughts and feelings that drift into how people think and feel. But so much of what this film is about is repression, how one must stuff real feelings underneath for responsibility. Of course, Laura loves her kids and, to a large extent even, her husband, who also talks and talks, though isn't as unpleasant to listen to as the chatterbox Dolly. But she still has thoughts - more narration, but the kind that is a rarity in intelligent movies, that reveals about character instead of spelling things out - and we feel for her even as she is doing something \"wrong\" in the eyes of many.The theme of Brief Encounter is universal, love that cannot be, going back to Shakespeare. But somehow this story spoke more to me - maybe as I'm an adult and not a teenager anymore - than, say, Romeo & Juliet. Laura and Alec, and as played by these two magnificent actors, mostly due to their restraint, but also in how warm and kind and generous they are as actors for their characters, are people who become so raw and moving that they become embedded in the audience's consciousness long after it's all over. There's also a nice contrast with a working class couple, who we see from time to time at the caf\u00e9 the middle class couple regularly meets at. It's interesting to see how their relationship develops in contrast to the main couple (perhaps obviously so, the only nitpick about the movie). But it makes Coward's play richer too; not all hope is lost for everyone, and, as usual, life goes on - until it doesn't.This is a small triumph about love in the face of all odds, and how mature people deal with it. Few tales of infidelity have ever been this rich, and though it may be aped by others it's hard to come close to its purity. And amid the ultimate sadness, there are still many moments of happiness between this couple. Hell, we even get a scene where they go to a Donald Duck cartoon! Perhaps today it might not work as well due to modern audiences expecting more passion, more sex. That might be fine for today. For 1945, its sense of showing love develop like this is never less than touching, and it holds up due to its sharp dialog, class distinctions, and the richness of Johnson's character and performance (Howard, too, is quite good, though is in a way kind of a supporting character too despite the length of screen time: it's Laura's story, ultimately). Along with Allen's Manhattan (which name-checked Coward at one point by the way), this is maybe the most simple but incisive film about love-loss in the 20th century.",

For moviegoers of the era, that template would have appealed to most at time when people weren't so self absorbed with celebrity and fame. Today, the picture would be a drag as an original release, although for cinema fans there's much here to admire. Director David Lean tells his story with compassion and grace, and though the extramarital affair appears doomed from the start, the fated couple enjoys their moments of fleeting happiness together. What I could have stood less of was the intrusive narration by Celia Johnson's character; my own feeling is that an effective story doesn't need to be translated by one of the characters. And if I didn't know the director of the film was David Lean, I would have guessed Hitchcock, who constantly employed chance meetings, conflicted characters and British ambience, with the railway station setting a natural.",

            "content": "My fourth film from David Lean is yet further proof \u0096 after the expressionistically atmospheric 'Oliver Twist (1948)' \u0096 that the director is every bit as talented when he's not creating sweeping widescreen Technicolor epics. A glance at the brief plot outline for 'Brief Encounter (1945)' didn't exactly catch my interest, but the deceptively-simple story is handled so masterfully that my attention never waned. Laura Jesson (Celia Johnson) is a happily-married housewife with two young children. For the duration of her marriage, she has remained dutifully loyal and absolutely content with her current situation; her husband, Fred (Cyril Raymond), is a plain and somewhat uninteresting man, but he loves her very much, and that's what matters most. Laura's tale unfolds in flashback, as she imagines recounting to her husband the emotional events of past weeks, as she came to fall in love with a charismatic married doctor, Alec Harvey (Trevor Howard). Following several chance meetings, as though fate were pushing them together, Laura and Alec begin their brief romantic liaison, despite the obvious immorality of their actions and the knowledge that their time together is devastatingly limited.In the early period of his directing career, Lean collaborated with producer/writer Noel Coward on four occasions, and 'Brief Encounter' is the result of their final partnership. The story was expanded from Coward's one-act place, \"Still Life (1936),\" and adapted by Anthony Havelock-Allan, Ronald Neame and Lean himself. In a refreshing change from most romantic pictures, 'Brief Encounter' depicts love as a frustrating, tormenting and even violent emotion; though Laura is at first enchanted by her affection for the handsome Alec, the guilt caused by her disloyalty threatens to destroy her emotionally, and the bitter fact that her love is ultimately doomed leads her almost to suicide. Robert Krasker's cinematography is beautifully moody, often using locomotive smoke {multiple pivotal scenes take place at a train station} as an effective aesthetic device. Some have noted the film's apparent ties to the film noir genre, with Lean choosing to shoot much of the film in rain-slicked streets, dimly-lit interiors and unglamorous industrialised train stations; the film's conclusion notes the futility of love, and its tragic, detrimental effect on comfortable family relationships.More than anything else, 'Brief Encounter' is an exploration of family morality. There's no doubt that Laura loves her husband, but her life with him is so tedious and unstimulating that her weekly shopping journeys into London are all that keep her functioning. Laura's romantic liaison with Alec fills her with an unbridled joy, an emotion that so overwhelms her that it is not until hours later that the ethical implications of her actions finally strike home. The devastating moment when she first finds herself lying to her husband, a minor but all-important detail, is one of the film's most powerful moments, more so when Laura later muses: \"It's awfully easy to lie when you know you're trusted implicitly.\" With its sympathetic attitude towards marital infidelity, a film such as 'Brief Encounter' could never have been made in Hollywood. The Production Code {a.k.a. the Hays Code} strictly prohibited the portrayal of adulterous relationships that were \"explicitly treated, or justified, or presented attractively.\" Nevertheless, the film was David Lean's greatest critical success to date, and his film was nominated for three Academy Awards {Best Actress, Best Director, Best Writing}, in addition to tying for the Grand Prize of the Cannes Film Festival.",

The hesitation to express their feelings followed by an equally overwhelming hesitation to let go. An affair very brief, doomed from the start but this brief doomed affair was the highlight of the lives on two very ordinary people.To the above add the fact that the ill fated lovers (who never were) never even had the chance to say goodbye out of fear of their affair being realised, only made their torture as well as the audience's even greater.A note should be made of how societies and attitudes change. I cannot help noticing how the protagonists of this story although they are involved in an illicit affair they maintain their dignity and class at all times. If that were the case in today's England chances are these two would take a bottle of vodka get drunk, have sex only to regret it the day after; a Bridget Jones kind of story in other words.

From this seed grows a friendship despite both of the pair already being married. Despite the odds, they continue their secret meetings even though they know that it cannot continue and must come to an end at some point.I watched this as I was curious how a film from this period would treat a relationship that was essentially adulterous.  I was unsurprised to see that the love affair was never actually consummated and that the nature of their relationship was very restrained and controlled despite the longing they both had.  How moved you are by the story depends on your view point I suppose.  I found it very hard to feel for these people as neither seemed to try and solve the problems in their marriages - I didn't support their relationship and it left me a little cold.  At times the emotion came through well, but for me personally I found the manner of their relationship to have a smothering effect on this.The look and feel of the film is still admirable though; it is in black and white and has a real atmospheric feel to it.  The claustrophobic nature of the sets and colours portrays the siege mentality of the lovers' relationship and feels almost like a noir so well is the atmosphere presented.  The cast do well but they are prevented from really letting their passion show in acts or words or looks due to the rules of the time in cinema.  Johnson delivers a good performance nonetheless; she is the one who demonstrates her inner turmoil the best.  I felt that Howard overdid the stiff-upper-lip thing and he never really convinced me as a man who was tearing himself away from the most important thing in his life.Overall, I am very aware that this film is often seen as a classic among critics and the wider populace, but I must say I didn't buy into it. Visually and atmospherically it really works, but as a love story I was left cold and disapproving of it.  I could understand what they were feeling but my inability to support them meant I was uncaring and unable to really sympathise with what they must have been feeling.",

That is just to name a few, yet people always forget the outstanding and underrated delight, Brief Encounter.Brief Encounter is a momentary story, however a film of which generations of film aficionados and the average film-viewer hold dear to their hearts. It was one of David Lean's first films and remains one of the most \"British\" films of all-time. It follows the story of Laura Jesson (Celia Johnson) who by chance meets Dr. Alec Harvey (legendary British actor Trevor Howard) and it quickly becomes obvious that they have fallen in love, which swiftly develops into a full-blown affair. The film remains sympathetic towards the two main characters, both actors wonderfully act out the guilt they feel for deceiving their marriages. Yet, the both of them can not retain from showing their love for one another; the film revolves around the infamous set-piece of a train station and tea-room.Brief Encounter was a highly controversial film upon release, even becoming banned in Ireland. Some may wonder why a film like Brief Encounter was controversial, there's no questionable content whatsoever and there is not one single explicit scene in film. Yet, the film does hold a beautiful sexual tension and shows sums up the \"guilt-ridden love\" which the protagonists feel for one another.Brief Encounter is beautifully shot, evenly paced and forcefully depressing, while remaining beautifully layered in charm and wit. The characters are splendidly scripted and then crafted with elegance. Brief Encounter is a film that has prowess; a classic piece of film-making and a film that has \"classic\" written all over it. Brief Encounter is heart wrenchingly honest when showing emotion and being open on the phrase \"love is a force beyond the power of nature\". Brief Encounter is bittersweet and poignant, without being soppy, sloppy or over-sentimental.Brief Encounter is a film that even today gets hailed as a classic of British cinema. It is also certainly a film in which the British Film Institute and British public hold dear to their classic cinema traditions. A highly recommended film and a romance that beats the cheesy, modern-day blockbuster romances, of which the market is horribly cluttered with.",

With respect to the cinematography we see influences of German expressionism (light and shadows) in the scenes when the lead characters are hurrying through the stationtunnels to catch their train on time after their little appointments. The use of the second piano concerto of Rachmaninov is very appropriate. The pulsating music symbolizes the pressure that the time table of the trains is putting on the appointments of the lovers.In effect \"Brief encounter\" is a sort of Western Ozu movie, describing middle class life just after the Second World War.Finally I would like to call attention to one tiny detail. The husband of the female lead is a crossword affectionado. This way Lean frames him as a little dull.

Rachmaninov's 2nd helps considerably, but the housewife and the doctor and their doomed romance, however improbable, manages to be both funny and touching, and Johnson in particular manages to put across the helplessness of a happily married woman who lets a new window open, just for a moment, in the realisation that it will be her only chance. David Lean's direction is atmospheric and sympathetic, and there are a number of choice smaller parts for the likes of Joyce Carey and Valentine Dyall. Perhaps the best of the Coward-Lean collaborations.",

Told in the first person, of Laura Jesson(Celia Johnson), a country housewife burdened with the boredom of the security of her husband(Cyril Raymond)and family. Laura goes on weekly shopping trips and a movie matin\u00e9e. An accidental meeting with Dr. Alec Harvey(Trevor Howard)at a railway station turns a casual relationship into a rapid developing love affair. Albeit brief and bittersweet these secret encounters in WWII England is intensely romantic.Wide-eyed Johnson is excellent as a woman knowing she is wrong, but letting her heart's desires rule her actions. Howard is cool and in control. Also in the cast: Stanley Holloway, Joyce Carey and Marjorie Mars. BRIEF ENCOUNTER is filmed in glorious black & white and dares your heart to get involved.",

            "content": "It might be thought that there is nothing new to say about this great classic, which every true movie lover must have seen. And 72 years later, fans are still visiting Carnforth Station in Lancashire where it was filmed to get the atmosphere for themselves. I have earlier pointed out that some inspiration for the film probably came from an earlier film, BRIEF ECSTASY (1937, see my review, which also had restrained lovers denying themselves happiness out of consideration for 'decency', which is Celia Johnson's word to describe her dilemma). But last night, BRIEF ENCOUNTER entered a new and higher dimension. At the Royal Festival Hall in London, it was shown on a giant screen with the music on the sound track replaced by live music from the London Philharmonic Orchestra and pianist Alexandra Dariescu, which was superbly played by Alexandra, who specialises in Rachmaninov. The evening began with a normal performance of Rachmaninov's Second Piano Concerto. After an interval, the film was shown with the orchestra and pianist sitting beneath the huge screen, and they played live all the portions of the same concerto to match the places where the recorded music would have appeared. Stripping the music from the film to enable this to happen was apparently so lengthy and tedious a business that in one day they could only get through sixty seconds of the film. This was truly a spectacular event, one of the great cinematic experiences one could have. In the last two scenes of the film, the sudden extra-loud burst of Rachmaninov from the live orchestra hit everyone in the solar plexus with such overwhelming force that the wave of emotion was almost unbearable. Much of the packed house consisted of younger people who could never possibly have met the type of English people of circa 1943 who were portrayed in the film. For about five minutes, there were ripples of laughter from the younger viewers at some of the dialogue and scenes, as the characters were behaving and speaking in a way so alien to them. But this very soon ceased. For the rest of the film, the enormous audience sat riveted in silence so intense that you could have heard them breathing if they weren't in fact mostly holding their breath in rapt attention. The overwhelming performances of Celia Johnson and Trevor Howard, with their honesty and purity of emotions, succeeded in silencing all cynical viewers entirely, as they sat immovable with amazement at what might for so many of them have been their first experience of seeing a film portraying pure romance. As has been wisely said, the power of the film largely comes from the fact that nothing happens, as only two or three stolen kisses and walking arm and arm, and sharing some laughter are all that the unfortunate couple manage to extract from their trapped situations. Having met by chance in a tea room at a railway station, with wartime rationing limiting the amount of milk and sugar they can have in their cups of tea, Johnson and Howard try to remain faithful to their spouses and home and children while falling hopelessly in love. And they succeed. Their self-restraint is a now vanished virtue in this age of today, where no one is restrained about anything any more. Truly this is the most outstanding memento of the traditional English 'stiff upper lip'. David Lean's fantastically inspired direction succeeds in making small matters happening in a rural train station into matters of world importance, since the film deals with the universal problems of love constrained by circumstance. The moody cinematography by Robert Krasker and the powerful editing by Jack Harris give such support to Lean's genius that the film was transformed into a work of art, using only the simplest of subjects and settings. The sub-plot of the flirtation in the station tea room between Stanley Holloway and Joyce Cary is wonderfully funny and well done, and acts as a necessary foil to relieve the tension of the main romance. The small actress Margaret Barton as the tea room assistant also adds character to the situation. I see from IMDb that she is still alive aged 91. Among the most astounding revelations in terms of casting, which I noticed in this viewing for the first time, is that the cellist and organist who gives such a touch of humour in the Kardomah and cinema scenes is none other than the much loved Irene Handl, who in her 183 film appearances was later to become Britain's most popular cockney actress. I never previously realized she was the actress in that part. And speaking of casting surprises, it is Noel Coward's own voice over as the station master making announcements. I wonder if there is anyone still alive who remembers seeing Coward's stage play, upon which this film is based. Three talented people, all uncredited, worked on the script and dialogue, namely Lean himself, Ronnie Neame, and Anthony Havelock-Allan. The evening was all the more remarkable in that it was introduced by actress Lucy Fleming, Celia Johnson's daughter (and Ian Fleming's niece). She read extracts from the letters which her mother wrote home from the filming location at the time, which were fascinating. She revealed that Johnson's daughter in the film was her real life niece, Henrietta Vincent. The letters describe Johnson's anxieties and apprehensions about getting the part right and being true to the character. She describes one occasion when they shot at the station all night until 7:30 AM. The studio work was done later at Denham. The reason why they had to go so far north as Carnforth to make the film was that the War was still on, and the Government would not give permission for arc lights to be used at night anywhere further south because of the German bombing. After the film my wife and I reminisced about visiting dear Trevor Howard at home when he was old.",

            "content": "David Lean's small masterpiece about forbidden love and failed relationships set amidst the atmospheric sects of suburban London is one of those movies that certainly stays with you and not for all the happy reasons. Cella Johnson and Trevor Howard perfectly portray two people in rather normal marriages and lives, yet feel unfulfilled and begin a simple yet passionate romance that lasts for weeks and changes them both, especially the woman, whom we see from her point of view. As the story progresses, we see the dullness and melancholy she goes through and the one chance at excitement and change she has when going out every Thursday. It is here she meets a handsome doctor and they obviously have feelings for each other. This story has been done many times, but in director Lean's hands, the film is centered on the two lovers and their tumultuous relationship. The film is very brief at only 86 minutes, but I think it is a testimony to the relationship of these two people and how it will impact their future. As mentioned before, the acting is strong especially in some small supporting parts with Stanley Holloway as a flirtatious stage conductor. The photography is moody and perfectly captures that dark, eerie feeling of post-war England. All elements come together in this terribly tragic but ultimately moving story about men, women, and everything that can happen between them.",

            "content": "Greetings again from the darkness. The Magnolia Theatre in Dallas included this one in its Summer Classic series and it drew a decent sized audience, even though the one-night-only showing was on the same evening as many of the local fireworks shows for Independence Day. If you are unfamiliar with this film, you should know that it garnered director David Lean his first of seven Oscar nominations. In contrast to this \"little\" film, Lean went on to direct such epics as The Bridge on the River Kwai, Lawrence of Arabia, and Doctor Zhivago.Marital infidelity has long been a favorite topic in Hollywood ... umm ... I mean on screen. Rarely is it treated with such respect as it is here. The story is based on a short play from the great Noel Coward. With numerous scenes added for the film version, it never feels forced or over-written. What really makes this one standout is that the two lead characters are basically happily married people who just stumble into each other and a bond forms ... despite their level-headed acknowledgments that it's not a good idea.Laura (Celia Johnson) and Alec (Trevor Howard) are just going about their daily routines when circumstances bring them together at the hectic train station. We learn this in the opening scene through the internal-dialogue (narration) coming from Laura. See, the bulk of the movie is a flashback as we are really starting at the end. This opening scene is brilliant as we can all relate to the frustration Laura feels as her yappy, but well-meaning friend, unwittingly crashes the going-away party. We see the torture on the faces of Laura and Alec, but it takes the rest of the movie for us to get the full story.The setting of a train station adds a time-sensitive element to the rushed time together. While they bond through tea, food and movies, the train whistle is the reminder that the precious moments are at the mercy of a schedule that won't allow for flexibility. This is no Meet-Cute of which films today seem to think is a required element. No, these are two real adults who have not before noticed an element missing in their lives. Perhaps Coward is saying that nothing must be missing for two kindred spirits to connect, but that the real choice continues to lie within each of us ... loyalty, fidelity and judgment are on constant alert.It should be noted that Celia Johnson's performance really carries the film. She was nominated for an Oscar and is just brilliant in her emotional roller coaster ride. Trevor Howard, a strong character actor, makes a terrific partner for her. They strike us as real people, not movie stars, caught in a real life dilemma. To prevent an over-wrought emotional wringing, we get the comedic balance of conductor Stanley Holloway and his flirtatious ways with prim and proper shopkeeper Joyce Carey. Their playful (yet similar) relationship counteracts the upper-crust complexity of Laura and Alec.The film and its players offer up a few interesting side notes. Celia Johnson was not a fan of acting. She was seduced into playing the role after her friend Noel Coward personally read the script to her. Celia was married to Peter Fleming, older brother of Ian Fleming - he of James Bond fame. Noel Coward had a multi-layered career that included playwright, actor, songwriter and singer, novelist and even director. Mr. Coward personally selected the Rachmaninoff piano concerto that so wonderfully accompanies the movie's happenings. The bookstore shown in the film was later spun off from Boots Pharmacy, which only this year was purchased by Walgreens. Lastly, the film was originally banned in Ireland for showing marital infidelity in such a positive light. Though released in 1945, it wasn't shown in the United States until 1946, thereby pushing the Oscar nominations to 1947.",

            "content": "David Lean's final collaboration with Noel Coward stands head and shoulders above his previous efforts. It is also one of the greatest achievements in British cinema of the 1940s, which is saying something.Firstly, this is quite simply a brilliant piece of writing from Coward. Much has been made of how daring it was in its acceptance of an extra-marital affair, but perhaps the real breakthrough was the frankness and realism with which it dealt with the universal experiences of love and heartbreak. It's beautifully simple and perfectly constructed. The idea of opening with the end of the affair, when we the audience know nothing about what has gone on, gives the final scenes such greater resonance when they come round again. The use of language is also inspired. Take for example Laura's daydream on the train, as she imagines dancing and dining with Alec in various exotic locations. As reality sets in again her monologue trails off into flat, everyday sounding words, taking us from the Caribbean to Ketchworth in a single sentence.All through the picture Lean's direction matches pace with the screenplay. I've mentioned in other comments how much Lean has in common with Hitchcock, even though they made very different films. Brief Encounter shows the kind of thing Hitchcock could have turned out had he wanted to make a romantic drama. The use of jarring sound effects, emotional close-ups and voice-overs to convey the intense psychological states is perfectly suited to this kind of thing. More than once Hitchcock used whistling trains to mimic a nightmarish scream. Lean uses them to symbolise the soaring emotions of his protagonists.This is a wonderfully rhythmic picture, right from the start, with the two trains perfectly timed to fly past at the beginning and end of the opening credits. The Rachmaninov piano concerto is ideal \u0096 just like Coward's play it runs the gamut of emotional tones, and there is enough in there to score a whole picture.The decision to return to black and white after the uninspired use of Technicolor in This Happy Breed and Blithe Spirit was an essential one. From start to finish the film is packed with atmosphere, with drifting smoke, light and shadow. The tone would simply be unachievable were in not in monochrome.As in The Happy Breed, Celia Johnson gives an amazing performance. Her delivery and her emoting are so natural and believable she helps prevent the film getting bogged down in staginess or melodrama.For those that like to think of directorial careers in that way, this could be considered David Lean's graduation picture. It's also his masterpiece (yes, I'd say it's better than Lawrence of Arabia). Brief Encounter is a timeless and monumental piece of film-making.",

            "review_title": "Why Is This Movie Magic.....an explanation!",
            "content": "Brief EncounterIn a review of this movie I could look at the history of postwar movies, the societal mores of 40's, the role of duty and destiny in film, the use of mood music, the list is just endless and each a 500 page book in itself. However, I want to focus on what is, what exactly is, the magic ingredient that makes this movie so enduring, raises it up as one of the most popular movies of all time, garners Oscars, and why has it has made a profound contribution to our very understanding of what we believe is Britishness.I have read other reviews on here and mostly they seem to get lost in the mire of the plot, the acting and the music, when really there is little remarkable here, in of itself, to raise this movie above the stature of any everyday \"soap-type\" drama.I think the unique \"magic\" of this movie lies with one simple thought, and this thought is stretched out across the whole canvas of the movie relentlessly by the director. This is the unresolved tension between personal choice and duty. Of course these two principles can co-exist, and perhaps this is the normal situation, however, when they exist in opposition or indeed contradiction we are all in big trouble and this is the human dilemma we see mirrored here.The \"magic\" is how David Lean, using every trick in the book, manipulates the viewer to feel the pendulum of choice swaying backwards and forwards between these two poles, duty or choice. I will give a few examples of how he achieves this effect and thereby manipulates the viewer to mirror this tension, in their seats, whilst watching the movie;-1, the script writing does not overly-develop the characters, in fact we really know very little about them, however their apparent \"normality\" makes the viewer fill in all the blanks and feel intimate with Laura and Alec. Sympathy2, the settings, the station, the trains, the station caf\u00e9, the running through tunnels, the rushing music, the whistles, the smoke, all of these give a feeling of urgent movement, despite nothing out of the ordinary really happening, these underpin the feeling of instability throughout. Instability3, the juxtaposition of the mundanity of conversations in the tea room and the constant chit-chat of the irritating friend masks the real action of Laura and Alec, you the viewer want to see the relationship progress at pace but we are forced frustratedly to watch these \"delaying\" scenes, this mimics the frustration of the characters in resolving their relationship. Sympathetic frustration.4, the masterful use of the camera to show reflections, close-ups, and micro-gestures of the characters shows a near forensic examination of conflicted inner emotion, most unsettling. (Indeed a very common Hitchcock trick)5, the inner world of Laura, whilst mostly appearing calm and collected on the screen, is revealed by the overlaying narrative, we see one thing, but hear another in direct conflict with the image, when her inner thoughts proclaim \"I'm an ordinary woman I didn't think such violent things could happen to ordinary people\" we see clearly the abyss of the her self destruction should she fly to close to the flames of passion, all said whilst she sits in a comfortable armchair by the fire assisting with the crossword. Image contradiction.In reality, it was never the case that Laura was going to choose Alec, never, never, never, but we feel, when the pendulum sways this way and then that, Laura could choose, it is this constant tension and the viewer being held in similar tension I feel is the magic of this movie.David Lean snaps the chord of this tension with the near self-destruction of Laura on the station platform, it was all just a storm in a teacup, in the tea-room in Milford. The coup-de-grace comes in the form of Fred, the husband, who says \"Laura, whatever you dream was, it wasn't a very happy one!, ......you've been a long way away,.......thank you for coming back to me\" when we all know duty must always come before the indulgence of personal choice, this is after-all, the fundamental British spirit and character.",

I have often thought that one of the biggest lies told by virtually all Hollywood films is the one about fate. Hollywood peddles the fib that happiness is out there about to come to you and all you have to do is, well, nothing. Just keep doing what you're doing, working your dead-end job, loving somebody who doesn't love you, yearning for the man or woman down the hall. Whatever's meant to happen eventually does, and you are meant to be happy.What a load of codswallop.\"Brief Encounter\" is one of very few films of any genre that acknowledges the fact that fate plays tricks, that it can give and take, and more often than not, leaves you wondering what could have happened if you hadn't stopped there at that moment, or looked away when you shouldn't have, or weren't buttonholed by a friend at the worst possible moment.It's almost unbearable, but \"Brief Encounter\" is proof that beauty comes from pain, just as pain comes from happenstance.",

            "content": "The beauty of David Lean's Brief Encounter as a love story is its unprecedented and natural showcase of the process by which Celia Johnson actually falls in love with Trevor Howard. And it fits her character so deeply, as she is the critical type, an unassumingly feminine vessel of healing and servility, on whose shoulder you want to rest your head. She is a suburban English housewife who tells her story in voice over in the first person while at home with her husband, imagining that she is coming clean about her affair to him. The story begins as she hazards into the neighboring town for shopping and to the cinema for a matin\u00e9e, by herself and generally content with that. Coming back from one of these weekly outings, at the station she gets a speck of gravel in her eye which is dabbed away by another passenger. Both are middle-aged, married, and have children. The other passenger, a doctor played by Trevor Howard, eventually divulges his enthusiasm for preventive medicine. Taking pleasure in each another's companionship, the two plan to meet again. They are soon worried to find their blameless and relaxed rapport swiftly growing into love.Most love stories, especially now, portray the characters' falling in love as an incident that has propelled the story. Brief Encounter, one of the few love stories to march to a different tune, is only about the spark and deepening and situational turmoil of love, laying bare the definition of it, its lack of any commonsense safety net, its random context, its power to make two people feel idealistic about themselves and ultimately about the two extreme extents of emotion in which it can leave you. And for this, a film must draw out the most personal familiarity with it all of each actor, the writer and the director. It is an emboldening task.Rachmaninoff's music emphasizes the uncontrollable feelings that put at risk the trustworthy tedium of the couple's otherwise normal romantic lives. The black-and-white cinematography, discernible by both stylishness and uncommon realism augments the story gradually with the most beautifully realistic tones and atmospheric Englishness.Brief Encounter carries Noel Coward's tenderly and sensitively in depth and perceptive script to radiant life, extracting lyricism and poetry from the most, to all appearances, ordinary doing. Trevor Howard gives a distinct performance, and Dame Commander of the British Empire Celia Johnson realizes a heartbreakingly wise, even moving portrayal of complete self- possession.",

It's not just how the train station--the refreshments room, the underground passage, and the platform in the opening shot--is used to create the sense of confinement but also the way that the whole film is shot in closeup. Even when Laura & Alec make their escapes to the country, the camera never pulls back to give you a panorama that might suggest that, at least for a few brief moments, they are free. Another effect of this technique is that not only do you feel how crowded Laura is by people like the silly acquaintance she runs into at the train station but you also virtually never see Laura & Fred in the same frame (until the very last shot, of course), which helps to portray her feeling of isolation.

            "content": "Brief Encounter is the story of a forbidden romance, an affair between a married woman and a man who meet at a train station. Their relationship is expressed in detail from the female character's conscious dialog reflecting on the affair, the lovesick girlish way she behaves around the young man (and before meeting him), and in speaking lies to her husband and friends in an attempt to hide the affair. This is an excellent observational film, and it really gets into the psychology of the characters who have the affair. The romance is so forbidden and sweet that it feels like the romance should go on and they should be together, but morals prevail and the couple soon learns that they must part ways. And they do part, in the most memorable fashion, with wonderful pacing that makes one think that they will, indeed, rush back into each other's arms.Brief Encounter is a wonderful English film which romanticized the train station. A good observation of characters and a detailed look at social history and marriage during the 1940s, Brief Encounter is to be enjoyed and admired as much as it is to be looked at from a historical and moral standpoint.",

            "content": "Quite simply, the most intensely romantic movie ever made. Plain Jane Celia Johnson meets dashing rogue Trevor Howard in a train station cafe. She has a loving husband but is obviously bored with a life that doesn't fill her time. He's a successful doctor having marital problems. They reach out to one another and make increasingly forward overtures at starting up an affair.With none of the melodramatic trappings that were the bread and butter of swoony romances up to that point in time, \"Brief Encounter\" is a love story for a more cynical, jaded audience. It exists in a world forever altered by a horrible world war, and it's a very realistic and adult portrait of adultery. We get swept up in the passion these two strangers feel for one another, but we are never allowed to forget that the indulgence of their urges could very well come at the expense of those they love. And, one also suspects that they likewise are not going to find the satisfaction they're looking for in one another; if they have the affair, how long before the forbidden glow wears off and they're faced again with the cold reality of their lives.Celia Johnson gives an astonishing performance as the heart and soul of this film. Her acting is wonderfully understated and intelligent, and she creates a wholly believable heroine. I don't understand how she didn't go on to have a more robust film career, unless her less glamorous looks held her back.My wife and I got a copy of this movie from our library, and with about half an hour to go, the DVD crapped out on us and we couldn't finish it. None of our local video stores had it, so we bought it just so we could see the end. Now we watch it regularly. So I guess that's my review in a nutshell: it's good enough to buy so that you can see how it ends.And I can never hear that Rachmaninoff theme without instantly thinking of this movie.Grade: A+",

The two were absolutely ideal together on the screen. The love they found and shared so briefly was memorably drawn into our minds by the strengths of their respective performances.Remember their parting scene? Remember when it appeared that Johnson would commit suicide? Remember, when she returns to her husband how he says, \"You came back to me!\" While the film may have been too talky as Johnson relates the encounter, it is a memorable one. Viewed by gossips, friends and colleagues by mistake, this was certainly a memorable film celebrating 2 top talents. It's as if the affair were ill-fated with Johnson and Howard meeting up with people they knew along the way as well as when Johnson returns home to find that her son has been hit by a car. Were these 2 people essentially bored with life, their spouses or with their intimate selves? The film deftly brings out that this could happen to any of us.A wonderful film especially for romantics of any age.",

            "content": "This movie handles a pretty delicate matter, at least for 1945 movie standards, when a middle aged married woman gets tempted to cheat on her husband when she falls for another married man whom she met at the train station.The theme of adultery of course wasn't too popular in the '40's but the movie in now way feels as if its deliberately trying to be controversial or groundbreaking. It's a movie that simply tells the story of average normal people, with real-life feelings and emotions.I call this movie a little drama since it's a British movie, made without a big budget or any big stars in it, though Trevor Howard became a well known name later in his career. It's also a movie set at limited locations and it of course is mostly set at the train station and its small caf\u00e9.Kind of ironic that this movie got directed by David Lean, who would later make many great big epics, such as \"The Bridge on the River Kwai\", \"Doctor Zhivago\" and \"Lawrence of Arabia\".It's a nicely directed movie, that keeps things going, without ever getting sentimental or over-the-top with any of its emotions. Also the story itself is kept simple, without ever heading into any sidetracks. Here is the story and this is how it is. Nothing more, nothing less. With this movie Lean also earned his first Oscar nomination and it was one of the first movies to win at the Cannes Film Festival.A real great little humble drama from David Lean!8/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/",

Celia Johnson gives a masterful performance as a decent, veddy British and proper lady who is swept away by a man she doesn't know; within four weeks, they profess their love for each other. But since this was 1945, there can't be much more than stolen kisses between the two amidst highly dramatic surroundings (tunnels, bridges, train platforms), yet Lean and Coward allow you to feel the intricacy of this relationship, the guilt but also the guilty pleasure. The movie is indeed as decent as the wife, but that doesn't make the \"illicit\" clinches any the less important, for this woman blossoms and matures in the course of the film, and the director is careful to let us sympathize...and swoon right along with her. *** from ****",

            "content": "Sir David Lean is probably best known for his large canvas approach to film-making but here he shows equal facility in working with effectively the miniature format in this simple, everyday tale of adultery.Trevor Howard and Celia Johnson are the star-crossed but ill-fated lovers, whose paths collide in a railway waiting-room. He's a General Practitioner, on his way home from work, while she's a bored housewife, out for her usual afternoon jolly in town where she'll do a bit of shopping, go to the movies and return home to her devoted, but dull husband. Howard, like her, is outwardly happily married with children but when cupid's dart strikes them both, they embark on probably the most platonic love affair depicted on-screen. That's not to say they're not passionate about one another, their every utterance and look confirms their mutual attraction, but when finally he gets her to meet him alone at his friend's empty flat they're both confronted with their own guilt and have to decide whether the game is worth the candle in taking their relationship to its natural conclusion with a physical union.Beautifully written by that old dilettante No\u00ebl Coward with surprising insight into human desire, it's also superbly directed by Lean, who knows that the whole film revolves around Johnson and tells the story from her viewpoint with her own recollections and inner monologues driving the narrative. Significantly, we witness her daily interaction with her crossword-loving husband and two young children and so get to share her inner conflict and yet we see nothing of Howard's personal life.She really does have a remarkably expressive face, so much so that Lean can barely keep his camera away from it, but when he does, it's to create beautiful little vignettes in monochrome, such as when the couple go boating on a lake, cross a bridge in the country or especially when Johnson beats her retreat in the night-time rain at the film's climax.One suspects the weather eye of the censor on that, I guess, predictable non-conclusion and yet the film still feels modern in taking us into the mind and wants of a woman dissatisfied with her supposedly happy life as a devoted housewife and mother.Swept along throughout on Rachmanonov's beautiful soundtrack, it's sympathetically acted by the two leads, especially Johnson. Although he's probably better remembered for those wide-screen blockbusters of his later years, here Lean ably demonstrates that less is more and shows himself to be an insightful commentator on class, relationships and most of all a woman's heart in this quite wonderful British movie.",

            "content": "If I ever taught a class in film, this would be one of the films that I would teach. There were so many moments in this film that I felt that I was watching a modern day piece of cinema. The emotion behind the characters, the stages of their relationship, and even the background that represents their attraction to each other. If anything, I would teach this film as a amazing film of character study. Here we have two characters, both of which we know nothing about, and even one that we know less and less about. Laura is our narrator, so we see the film through her eyes. We see her daily routine, we see her children, we see her family, we see Laura's life. We never see Alec's life which somehow always left me to question the truth behind him. Celia Johnson does a beautiful job of playing the confused housewife. The woman that is comfortable with the life that she has, but somehow searches for more. She questions her life, wondering if there perhaps may not be something more behind an unexplored door. This door is Alec. She stumbles upon him randomly and opens the door to find that he is just as repressed as she is. Together they fall into each other's arms. In three weeks, meeting only three times, they are in love ... confessing it to each other. You don't see lovers climbing balconies or dying in each others hand. You see unbridled love. You witness the excitement from Laura of meeting someone new, the disappointment when she doesn't get to see him on one of her scheduled Thursdays, you see the shame on her face as she lies to her husband about her where-abouts that day, and you see the realization in her eyes that this romance will never last. They have their own lives, they have forged their own paths, and while they may dream about what life may have been like if the two of them had ever ended up together, they both know that it will never happen. One of my favorite scenes in this film is when both Laura and Alec are in the train station and they are talking about how their relationship will never work, how they must never see each other again. The train station represents their departure. It is symbolic of their carriage that will take them back to their \"real\" life. It is almost as if it is the crossroads of their life. In the city they are a happy couple, in the train station (especially in the deli) they must now watch their back, and be weary of who may be watching. Then they board the train and head back to their husband/wife respectively. In this scene, as they are talking about how they can no longer be together, we are taken back to the beginning of their romance when a young couple runs behind them to catch the train. Almost as if we were watching them together again, running ... arm-in-arm to catch the train. I was impressed with this film and I actually enjoyed it. I think film students in a classroom setting would appreciate it more for the film history value. This is the perfect cinematic example of two star-crossed lovers that can never be together!!

            "content": "It's a woman's story, told from her point of view and in her own narrative voice, about a passionate but Platonic affair between a married woman, Johnson, and a doctor, Howard, who meet accidentally at a railway station and begin to have dates every Thursday. They go to the movies, have lunch, spend afternoons in the countryside, gradually fall in love with each other, and then part.But it's an adult woman's story and younger people, who don't think much any longer about mores, may be bored with it because they don't understand what all the fuss is about. Never mind adultery and self respect. If they like each other, why don't they immediately go to bed? That's unfair of me, I know, but let me put it this way: for those who see \"One Night In Paris\" -- about Paris Hilton frolicking in the sack with her boy toy of the moment -- and think of it as a love story, \"Brief Encounter\" will seem pretty dull.Here, for instance, is the opening scene. I defy any normal debauched fifteen-year-old boy to find this in any way gripping.A gabby woman, all smiles and chatter, is in a tiny railway caf\u00e9 and spots a friend, Johnson, seated at one of the tables with a stranger. She bustles over, invited herself to sit down, and blathers away. The stranger, Howard, is introduced as a doctor who is leaving England next week. He appears to be nothing more than a casual acquaintance of Johnson's.But it doesn't take much effort on the part of a viewer to see that something of import is going on between Johnson and Howard. They each look solemn, they cast furtive glances at one another while trying to be polite towards the intruder. The gabby woman has interrupted something -- but what? Well, she's just amputated the last few minutes that two mature people who are deeply in love are ever going to have together. The couple sit and listen silently, then Howard announces, \"I must go,\" stands up and says his good-byes, and places his hand briefly on Johnson's shoulder before walking away.It's not a soap opera or a Harlequin romance, even though Howard is a doctor instead of, say, a humble book keeper. None of the characters is evil or even ill intentioned. Both Howard and Johnson act about as sensibly as any two people of maturity would act in 1945. They must be careful to preserve their own dignity and to avoid gossip. When they have a rather lavish lunch, they must lie to friends about the champagne.It was directed by crabby David Lean, who had made a spectacular \"Great Expectations\" and was to go on to the even more spectacular \"Lawrence of Arabia.\" He's extremely skillful. There is, after all, no action in the film, no mystery, no spooky atmosphere. Yet he and his photographer have made the best possible use of stony night time settings among brick buildings, cobble stone streets, and deserted public squares. The lighting and shadows induce an atmosphere of drama without being at all menacing. Lean gets in some licks at Hollywood during the previews in the local movie theater. \"COLOSSAL.\" \"STUPENDOUS.\" \"EPIC MAKING.\" \"FLAMES OF PASSION.\"The acting is fine too. Trevor Howard has never been a volcano of expressiveness but the role calls for someone with passion who is unwilling to divulge what he feels. (He would be otherwise for Lean in \"Ryan's Daughter.\") Ditto for Celia Johnson. They're both of the right age as well. They're not yet middle aged, only on the cusp, and they have that sinking feeling that, after this, nothing truly dramatic is going to happen in their lives. Their personal niches are already established.Howard may seem a little wooden, but we certainly get our fill of Celia Johnson's buried impulses through the course of her narration. She's a handsome woman, married to the stereotypically reliable but dull mate. He's a nice guy, though, a decent provider, and he and Johnson love their two children. She has a thin, geometrically perfect nose that ends in a dull point, and over-sized calf-like eyes that radiate winsomeness and a fear of the dark. In some ways the most interesting character is the friend whose flat Howard uses for an abortive assignation with Johnson. That would be Valentine Dyall, who almost catches Johnson in the apartment and makes snide comments about her. The actor -- and the role as written -- leaves us wondering if he's gay.Anyway, given the simplicity of the story, it's not likely to get much better than this. Rachmaninoff's second piano concerto, which has since become almost a clich\u00e9, helps.",

            "content": "Beautiful, engaging & packed with powerful emotions, Brief Encounter effectively breaks down the gradual process of falling in love through the intense feelings of passion experienced by two married strangers whose chance meeting at a railway station sets into motion a series of events that leaves a lasting impact in the lives of both.Directed by David Lean, the film doesn't have the vast canvas, broad brushstrokes & epic stories that the filmmaker is today best known for but it sure has the same intimacy in every fibre of its frames. The progression of the characters' bonding is carried out with such compassion that their relationship feels genuine, heartfelt & incredibly fascinating to watch.Their married life only adds more complexity to the love that blossoms between the two. They are aware that it is against the sanctity of matrimony and even try to resist the temptation. But what they feel in each other's presence is also more wholesome, intoxicating & emotionally fulfilling than their settled lives at home. And deep down, they both know it won't last forever.Celia Johnson & Trevor Howard play the doomed lovers, and deliver outstanding performances. Curiosity, confusion, interest, hesitation, trepidation, guilt, shame, longing & overwhelming sense of loss, Johnson perfectly articulates every single one of these emotions and is effortless in her rendition. Howard is just as good if not better. And the palpable chemistry they share is both heartfelt & convincing.Overall, Brief Encounter is a timeless treasure that exhibits ample understanding of the why n what its characters are feeling in each other's company and looks at it from an objective lens. How this forbidden romance will end is clear in the first scene itself but it sure don't make things easier or less poignant & heartbreaking when the film later returns to it. Quite the contrary actually. An enduring gem of its genre, this British romance is definitely recommended.",

            "content": "*This review may contain minor spoilers*Brief Encounter (1945) is something I'd like to call a near masterpiece, if not simply a masterpiece. It's well made to every single detail; The acting by the leading actress (Celia Johnson) is remarkable, the direction surprised me in a good way, this certainly doesn't follow the basic scheme of a love story. A very capturing film indeed, it's a good proof of its great screenplay.This movie feels like a film-noir picture, but there's no criminality or murders. Instead there's a love affair, between a man and a woman who both are married. They start having secret (brief) encounters at a railway station. The trains that lead to the station become symbols of getting away and letting go.The station is the place where they can escape the dull reality. It's the place where they can love each other without thinking of their spouses. When they're together they forget the outside world. But: \"Nothing lasts really. Neither happiness nor despair. Not even life lasts very long.\" As Laura Jensson said.A surprisingly sad romantic film, something I wasn't expecting, but something I was very pleased with. I just wanted to find something entertaining for the Saturday afternoon and ended up watching a cinematic gem. All of us know David Lean as the director of the Lawrence of Arabia (1962) the epic spectacle film. So if you've seen that, this is something completely different. A small film, you might say, but sometimes small is better.The film-noir feeling, that I mentioned before, is captured in the storytelling, camera-work and lighting. And all of those worked brilliantly. As we know film-noirs were dark and this also is a dark story. A survey of misery, about letting go.9/10 Near masterpiece by David Lean, film-noir of love.",

It makes me think, that maybe it is we - in our time - that are cheated, when it comes to love and life. We can get a divorce very easily, even with children in the marriage, without anybody rising an eye-brow. We can have causal sexual relationships. Unfaithfulness is still seen as bad by most people, but not by far so bad as in the 1940:s. It is almost more common that children grow up with single mums or in step-families, than in nuclear families. And so on.We think we are modern, mature and realistic, but I think we miss out on what these people in the movie had. They had a strong feeling of responsibility, decency, and self-respect. And I wonder, if a sacrifice like theirs would not still make you feel better about yourself in the long run, than any however so exciting sexual adventures - even if you do not realize this at the time. I think there is much to say for old-world morals..! Despite of the above, I think it was refreshing to see a middle-aged and not very physically attractive love couple for once. This was very innovative and modern I think - not even in our time they make many movies, in which a middle-aged, and a little worn and haggard mother can still kindle strong feelings in a man.

            "content": "I may not have seen any of David Lean's work from prior to this 1945, suburban drama, but it would seem before he was taking on the broad and war themed epics he is more commonly known for in Laurence of Arabia and The Bridge Over the River Kwai, he was taking on much more smaller, but equally epic in their own right, projects like Brief Encounter. Films like Brief Encounter get across a sense of the grand or of the 'epic' through facial expressions and reactions on the character's behalf. They are driven by emotion, feeling and action; a sense of danger but a sense of excitement. Films like Brief Encounter can turn a relatively mundane event like a train passing through a station, and make it dramatic or visually exciting; through sheer horror or otherwise.Brief Encounter might be one of the films others refer to when attempting to label Lean with an auteur status of some sort. The film is, essentially, a relatively routine story about a female meeting a male and becoming rather fond of one another. What Lean does is make it seem as anything but familiar or 'routine', through a series of conventions and ideas including, but by no means limited to, telling the film through a female perspective and encompassing a certain taboo feel to the film by having both characters married, but continuing with this affair of sorts anyway.The film begins with a certain Laura Jesson (Johnson) sitting in a train station caf\u00e9 with a man, a doctor, named Alec Harvey (Howard). Another woman comes over and sits down with them, happily nattering away and ruining what we will later discover to be quite an important moment for both individuals. The individual talking away like she does acts as an immediate distraction for the audience, perhaps forcing us into listening to what she is saying rather than observing what the other two are expressing: a certain angst on their faces. We feel there might have been something between them and this is confirmed later on when, on the train home, Laura provides a voice-over detailing she wants her immediate 'feelings' to 'pass'.The film is, primarily, narrated to the audience as a would-be confession to Fred Jesson (Raymond), Laura's husband whom she sits opposite in the evening upon getting home and 'speaks' to. This seems to suggest what a woman's (for the time) behaviour should reflect, but demonstrates Laura as an oppositionalist to this ideation. Someone that should not have indulged in the near-affair activity she has been for the past few weeks, plus, when the time comes that it ends, she does not even confess to the husband who should, as the man of the house and dominant figure, have the right to know. Rather, she keeps it to herself and us the audience, blurring the lines between what is essentially a confession to us but also a placing of us within he female perspective \u2013 a forcing, for the males in the audience, to see things from a woman's point of view and the problems that arise in being labelled the 'lesser' of the two genders. Laura does, at one point, even offer an apology for loving this other man.The scenes in which the love blooms mostly carry that very sweet and soft natured tone. If the two go to the cinema, it's as if what's showing and how good it was is immaterial to the fact they are out together and actually there. Additionally, if they row off course on the lake and into a low bridge, getting a bit dirty as they try to get back on course comes with the territory. The point of all this amounts to the distinct change in mood Lean applies to this text, his daytime and very upbeat scenes of the pair twinned with dark, gloomy and nighttime set scenes of both danger and guilt; two examples of which might be Laura around at Alec's apartment before one of Alec's acquaintances arrives and comes close to seeing them both there as well as the following scene in which Laura 'feels like a criminal' for having to 'escape' Alec's apartment.The prior writings on this film seem to allude to a new found identification for women, specifically following The Second World War. Perhaps the film is an anti-thesis of sorts to the ideation, if one is a woman, one must find a partner and settle down as soon as possible while systematically focus on raising two children (as Laura does in this film, one boy and one girl); keeping a neat and tidy house (as Laura does, thanks to lingering shots of their rather pristine living room) and making the dinner when required. In Brief Encounter, Laura goes through an experience following one of her many trips to a local town for supplies and so forth, that would have been of a far more pleasurable and less stressful nature had she not have subscribed to what she was 'required' to do as a young woman. It opens up some interesting issues to do with independence and individuality on the female's behalf, the kinds of which the text very much explores wonderfully well and is well worth checking out.",

The script conveys the guilt-laden ecstasy of adultery with surprising candour, especially given its era, and the narrative ploy of showing the same scene from different perspectives predates Tarantino by 50 years! Despite the insanely aristo accents, Johnson and Howard turn in wonderful performances, brimming with restrained English passion, and they do it all under the impeccable gaze of Robert Krasker's beautiful cinematography, managing to transform an old Northern train station into an embodiment of mystery, passion and danger. The fact that 'Brief Encounter' was running against 'Henry V', 'The Best Years of Our Lives' and 'It's A Wonderful Life' in the 1947 Academy Awards suggests that there may be some truth in the notion that they don't make 'em like they used to. A dazzling, monochrome gem of a movie: very English, and a deserved classic.",

            "content": "Filmmaker David Lean is best remembered for the grandest of epic action adventure films such as Lawrence of Arabia and Bridge on the River Kwai. Massive productions shot on location with casts of thousands, Lean was the master of the genre. Then there is Brief Encounter, an intimate tragic love story shot mostly in and around a train station. A polar opposite but every bit the polished masterpiece Lawrence is. For the most part it is a series of close-ups and two shots focusing on its two main characters played by Trevor Howard and Celia Johnson. Yet Lean is equally adept at achieving the same high level of powerful emotion found in the panoramic settings of his epics from two people sipping tea at a table in a train station. Trevor Howard is just right as the doctor whose innocent good samaritan act has him falling in love. His lack of movie star looks gives him an ordinary but sincere earnestness that allows you to sympathize with his infidelity. Celia Johnson as the everyday housewife is a wonder. Her guilt ridden narration coincides beautifully with her sad eyed visage of a woman struggling with her emotions. The scene where she finds herself falling in love with Howard registers perfectly on her face where, saying nothing you not only feel that love but also the melancholy of her situation. Touchingly subdued and understated it is the best female performance I have ever seen in a Lean film and one of the best in all of film, period.Contrasting the mannered performance of the leads are two station employees doing their own Cockney mating dance in a more earthy style. As the couple Joyce Carey and Stanley Holloway are absolute scene stealers, not only providing comic relief but giving the film a crucial balance that helps prevent it from becoming too maudlin or syrupy. Then there is the music score, Rachmaninoff's piano concerto #2. It is perfect background music for this romantic masterpiece that gets better with age.",

            "content": "The relationship that develops between a British housewife (Celia Johnson) and a doctor (Trevor Howard) happens quickly and lasts briefly. Writer Noel Coward and director David Lean present two people who are needy at the same point in their lives, falling into something sudden and deep. The story takes place over the course of four Thursdays.They meet casually on the first Thursday, when Laura Jesson gets grit in her eye on a train platform. Dr. Alec Harvey, a man she just met in the refreshment room, helps clean it out. Initially their interaction is quite minimal. Hardly romantic. Later they end up seeing each other again outside a store. It's another platonic run-in. He takes the afternoon off from his medical practice, and they go to the cinema together.Laura and Alec have such an enjoyable time, they decide to do it again the following Thursday. During the six and a half days that follow, Laura considers not seeing Alec again but does end up going. He has a medical emergency and doesn't make it to the restaurant where they planned to dine. However, he finds her later at the train station when she's heading home. He explains what happened and they agree to try again the following week.The third Thursday it become more serious. They take in another movie then enjoy a lovely drive together. Alec kisses Laura at the station before they go their separate ways. The fourth Thursday they want more. Alec's staying at a friend's apartment downtown and asks Laura to head over there with him.She declines, then changes her mind at the last moment. Alone in the apartment, it seems as if they will consummate the relationship. But all of a sudden Alec's friend returns, so Laura has to hurry out a back door. She feels ashamed. Yet all they've done is kissed, nothing else.Laura phones her husband and fibs about why she's spending so much time downtown and why she can't get home to fix dinner. She is not owning up to what's been happening with Alec. Though, ultimately, Laura realizes it has to end. This is when Alec says he's been offered a job in South Africa which he will take to make things easier on both of them. Neither one will leave their spouses or children to be with each other.It can't be anything more than friendship, because BRIEF ENCOUNTER is restrained by the production code. The characters are bound by a strong sense of morality. Laura and Alec's story, which is quite simple, allows us to feel powerful emotions. There is light comic relief with minor characters in the refreshment room of the train station to offset the heavier moments. And there are also scenes set in the present, where she's at home with her husband and children, remembering the events of the past four Thursdays.Perhaps the most engaging part is Laura's continual voice-over narration. We are privy to her innermost thoughts and feelings. She is telling her husband everything in her mind, but we are the ones she's really telling. She's a lonely soul, trying to maintain propriety but needing to reach out and connect with someone in a meaningful way. She decides a lot of the people she meets are idiots; she even calls herself an idiot at one point. But she doesn't consider Alec idiotic at all.In an interesting sequence, Laura's on the train home and looks out the window. She glimpses herself dancing with Alec, driving with him in the countryside again and traveling abroad with him. It's presented as a montage, but a fantasy montage.At one point the camera switches to the reverse angle of the fantasy figures dancing. Suddenly from their vantage point we see Laura on the other side of the train window. It's a skillfully made, imaginatively conceived film. The primary setting is the train station. But it really takes place in another realm. Two hearts have been derailed but are now back on track.",

That two \"average\" people meet by chance and fall in love is a plot to which all of us other average people relate. That these two can have a most passionate love affair without actually having sex is a tribute to the writing, direction and the acting. I tear up every time I watch, knowing the ending but still hoping for them to somehow stay together. Yes, they are committing \"adultery\" - but they have lived the stayed and somewhat boring stereotypical British life and find a glimmer of passion in spite of it.

            "content": "There isn't very much to the story of BRIEF ENCOUNTER--two strangers, with their own families and lives, meet from two different walks of life. Over the course of a few Thursdays, Laura (Celia Johnson) and Alec (Trevor Howard) meet by accident, become friends, and fall deeply, desperately in love. Their encounter, however, is brief for a reason--when apart, they can't wait to be together again; but when together, they (especially Laura) are wracked with guilt at betraying their respective spouses. The tale is told through Laura's eyes, and most of the film shows the lovers as they struggle to deal with the guilt brought about by betrayal, mixed with the heady rush of true, deep love.That's all there is to the tale--one would imagine it'd be a storyline better fitted for a short story, since only the written word could do such a scenario justice. But BRIEF ENCOUNTER, benefitting from the simple, unadorned writing of Noel Coward and the voiceovers given to the character of Laura, is supremely successful in creating the atmosphere needed for this story to work on screen--one of furtive intimacy. In the brief kisses stolen, on bridges and in a stranger's apartment, you feel always that Laura and Alec are both truly happy but desperately worried at the same time. Their final parting is heartbreaking in its simplicity; the lack of fanfare somehow fitting a relationship that was doomed from the beginning. It's a farewell ruined by a chatty, gossipy acquaintance, and the end of a love ultimately not recognised and therefore, by some measure, unreal.The actors who fill the roles of Laura and Alec are pivotal because it is necessary to make the love story one that is believable, and most importantly, sympathetic to the audience. Both Celia Johnson and Trevor Howard rise to the occasion--Johnson in particular is a brilliant choice. Her large, expressive eyes easily register the emotions--the pain and loneliness and desperation--that cannot be put into words, however effective the voice-over.A film that is at once heartbreakingly simple, and yet simply heartbreaking. Delightful.",

As well as the interactions between the two strangers, we get to see the life of the woman Celia Johnson and an insight into why she may be tempted into an affair. The two leads the doe eyed Celia Johnson and the charming Trevor Howard are brilliant exuding a great chemistry that really does convince you they are in love. Even the back up characters are great and add extra charm to an already charming film. This is very much a film of it's time full of lovely plummy old English accents that hark back to a seemingly gentler period. It all builds to a wonderfully poignant climax which leaves the viewer in a moral quandary. Brief Encounter is undoubtedly a classic and even though it's nearly 70 years old the subject matter is timeless. A fantastic film that remains eminently watchable even today.",

            "content": "This couldn't be more romantic--all the more so for it depicting unrequited love. Trevor Howard and Celia Johnson are convincingly taken with each other, as the casually-met commuters Alec and Laura. The plot is nothing here but the elaboration of the premise. That is--what happens between two married people, both somewhat unsatisfied, not quite young, and sort of attractive--fall in love? Brief Encounter reminds me a lot of the less successful DeNiro/Streep movie Falling In Love, from 1984. I mention this much later film because I don't think Brief Encounter is dated. Sure, by the 80s it was much easier to sneak around, but that element really only matters in one scene in Brief Encounter. Otherwise, the qualities (and the emotional content) of infidelity haven't changed.We see this mostly from Laura's point-of-view. I agree with those who see some of the skulking about amid noirish backdrops; we're usually either in dismal weather, in nightime, or both. Even the escapes to the country have a desperate, contingent feel. Laura has to be around Alec, but never really relaxes with him, either. The fact that we never see his family is a device to keep the focus on Laura. She can't just slip back into the comforts of home without some guilty psychosomatic consequences. It's true that there's nothing wrong with her domesticity. After all, the reason she's able to cross paths with Alec and develop their relationship is that she has plenty of free time, presumably because her husband does well enough so that she can be out and about during the day.Cyril Raymond, as her husband Fred, makes a solid, straightforward, if somewhat dull spouse. We get the feeling that Laura realizes her life will never change appreciably. She's maybe in her late thirties and already feels middle-aged; Alec represents the path not taken. She doesn't want to face the facts: she has her family, she's a wife and mother, but what about her? In a more banal sense, she lacks excitement. She's just vulnerable enough (as is Alec) to entertain an alternative. So she finds herself arranging things so she has plenty of time to meet up with Alec at the rail station's cafe, and then venture out on 'dates'.The more adventurous she gets with Alec the harder it is to conceal things: her lies multiply, she gets seen with him, she misses a near-emergency with one of her kids, etc. One might say that he does the right thing by moving to South Africa. It's either something like that or they both get found out. At least that way the status quo can be left intact. It's agonizing for both of them in their final scene together when the chatterbox friend monopolizes their time. But it's fitting as well, since it shows the fragility of their relationship. Even though it's not more than a bare hint, the possibility of their reuniting in some undetermined future leaves an intriguing gloss to the romance.This is beautifully done. There's so much conveyed in Johnson's eyes, by the subtle shifts in her face, that you want there to be more. A sort of autumnal sadness, vivid but quiet and melancholy. Some very good movies make you think--this one makes you feel. An exceptional character study; hard not to watch. 10/10.",

Who among us hasn't had strong feelings for someone they can never have? Trevor Howard delivers stoic but believable lines. Celia Johnson conveys her inner conflicts with amazing realism. What really surprised me how Rachmaninoff's Second Piano Concerto was so welcome to me as a viewer. Many times, especially in the older classics, I find the music a distraction. In Brief Encounter, each time the Concerto came on, it was a stirring moment.Love is such a strange emotion. It is silly when we see it in others, and how it causes them to behave. On the other hand, it is very real to us when it hits home. This movie lets us inside the heads of two respectable people as they struggle with self-control and social boundaries.I couldn't help thinking about how, were this movie made in today's Hollywood (maybe it has been remade???), we would have been treated to a bedroom scene or two. In my opinion, that would have cheapened the film and taken away from the intense romantic mood. Watch for Howard's hand on Johnson's shoulder in their final scene together. If it does not give you goosebumps, then you have been officially desensitized and should stick to modern, R-rated \"romances!\"",

Both have means of getting places and where one is perfectly balanced, the other is harder to stabilize. If comparing Brief Encounter (1945) to Love Actually (2003), you know that the latter is the bike with an uncontrollable and unstable use of clich\u00e9s which drives it into the predictable and poor section of British cinema whereas Brief Encounter takes a controversial concept and uses it in a comfortable manner to make for a film that reflects the true meaning of love, which arrives at an unpredictable destination.It's very sad to see British cinema has fallen away in the romance genre. Having viewed many British romances including Notting Hill, Four Weddings and a Funeral and Love Actually, I find it amazing to think the same country produced this film, which contains the same ideology of facing love against all odds, but is handled in such a more delicate and consequential manner.Oscar nominated Celia Johnson steals each scene with a shy and analytical approach whereas Trevor Howard is that charming and likable symbol of hope, and not a clich\u00e9 man with curly hair stereotype emerging from out of the blue.This film is all about the love story. Filmed just after the Second World War we see little evidence of the war in this setting as the film focuses upon social class. Made at a time when divorce was the last option for a married person we see drama and heart breaking moments because of Laura's social class. The posh voices, settings and dress codes will make you wonder what has happened to this country.Many may argue the film is now dated but how does the issue of betrayal and love really differ from modern cinema and significantly, real life? This ultimately feels different from the majority of current romances. There is inevitability about current films such as the ending. They are star driven clich\u00e9s that do not have a point or purpose.Brief Encounter is a surprise. A shocking and riveting view, told in a dramatic flashback mode that questions betrayal and love. Composed with Sergei Rachmaninoff's beautiful score, we have arguably one of the finest British love stories.",

            "content": "A spoiler can't apply here, as the title gives the show away. Viewing this film in 2005 is an experience. Firstly, to be reminded that 'class' Brits really did speak (then) like these main characters (the sheer speed of that RB speech for a start) against the pervasive time warp for this viewer raised in far away New Zealand. Decades rolled back and I recall how many older acquaintances 'way out here' simply LIVED for these British treasures, just loving the sheer clipped classiness of them all. Against that is the still relevant timelessness of an unsought, unexpected event of two people already married falling headlong into a 'true love' but which in today's 'freedoms', would be relatively OK to go along with, and never mind the fall-out of 'broken homes' etc.As historical evidence it is almost surreal to be reminded that middle-class women really did lead such challenge-less lives of 'duty' in this case to a suit-wearing but always kindly husband and a child, and the train trip to town to shop, have lunch, and go (alone usually) to a movie was the uplifting event of the week.Despite the uncomfortable reminder that this really was how dutiful middle-class Brits (and others) expected to live their lives, David Lean with Noel Coward's material transcends the unbearably mundane to an absorbing viewer engagement that lasts many hours after. Despite the inevitability of the outcome being signalled through the technique of voice-over protagonist recall, I couldn't help being drawn into the minutiae of the life-changing encounter, nurturing an empathy right through that something good just might happen to bring around a happy ending.I learnt later that this was filmed whilst World WarII was still going on, but the war forms no part of the narrative, and the location was a single railway centre in a small township apart from London and any possible sounds of war.Absorbing, engaging and memorable.

            "content": "This is an excellent and very true film, with a masterfully nuanced and real performance by Celia Johnson. The emotions the woman goes through, her decisions and why she makes them, all ring true. I wouldn't change a thing in the film, but I do think that viewers misread the situation if they think that the feelings between the man and the woman are the love of two soul-mates for each other, or that these two could have had a happy life together if only they had met before they'd married other people, or if only society would let them divorce their current spouses. The time-constraints of most movies (other than specifically \"here's how they fell in love\" movies) typically make it necessary for characters to fall in love so quickly, that the only source of love presented in movies typically is 'love at first sight' or the immediate recognition of soul-mates. But that is not the kind of emotion that is going on in this movie. To understand the emotion these two feel for each other it is important to recall one of Jane Austen's greatest insights into the sources of feelings of love: the feeling of gratitude one feels upon discovering that some worthy person of the opposite sex appears to feel esteem and love for you. What we have here are two people who, like most of us who are over 40, have gone a good many years without having sparked in the heart of some new person special feelings of regard and admiration. Thus each one is particularly ready to feel grateful and appreciative of someone who does appear to feel that way. Through their chance encounter, the man and the woman here each get the impression that the other finds them quite pleasant and admirable; and each feels such gratitude for this that the warmest feelings arise for the other. Thus the love each feels for the other doesn't spring from any deep knowledge of the other person's character or qualities or interests, it springs from a response to the other's perceived feelings. And thus, to use an analogy from sound amplifiers and microphones, an emotional feedback loop comes into play, where the emotion expressed by one instigates a stronger emotion in the other, which in turn instigates a stronger emotion, etc. Jane Austen explores this dynamic in Pride & Prejudice, chapters 6, 44, and 46, where her characters note that there is \"so much of gratitude or vanity in almost every attachment,\" and how it is Elizabeth's feelings of gratitude for Darcy's admiration of her that leads to Elizabeth's love for Darcy, and how the 'love at first sight' alternative was a much more untrustworthy basis for feeling love, because that was how her love for the rake Wickham developed. Austen also explores this in Northanger Abbey, ch. 30, where Henry Tilney's love for the heroine Catherine is founded on no quality of hers, but springs from his gratitude for her love for him. Thus I agree with commenter \"roghache\" (March, 2006), about Laura's husband Fred, and who said that if the man and woman here did leave their spouses and marry, very soon their marriage would look like the woman's current marriage with her husband (I have more comments on Fred in the \"did her husband know she was carrying on\" message board). There is simply no good reason to think that the doctor is so much different a man than her current husband. Indeed, there is good reason to think he is worse: for the doctor is a married man who takes the initiative to cheat on his wife and to persuade a married mother of young children to cheat on her husband and risk her children's happiness. The doctor's friend, who surprises them in the flat, quite properly feels contempt for the doctor (in the one scene in the film that gives us information that Celia's character did not have) (I have more comments on this in the \"what if Stephen hadn't returned\" message board). Were Celia Johnson's character not the woman who was the object of the doctor's affection, but instead a woman looking on as he directed his attentions to one of her friends, I think she would see quite quickly that he is not an admirable man. Lastly, I note that it is not 'society' that is keeping these two from marrying, it is the commitments they have made in the past, by which they obtained spouses, children, and places in society that they obviously value, that hold them back. There is no more reason why 'society' ought to be reformed so as to allow them to end those commitments and yet keep their reputations for honor, than for 'society' to be reformed so as to allow them to stop making payments on their mortgages yet keep their houses, if they are tired of the jobs they have to do in order to get the money to pay the mortgages. Dramatists and filmmakers too often treat sexual and family commitments with a level of unimportance that perhaps reflects their own desire that such commitments not be very binding in their own lives. If, however, the commitments in question were commitments by film producers to pay contractually- promised fees and royalties to writers and directors, I think our movies would be filled with expressions of the high inviolability and importance of keeping promises.",

I wasn't expecting that he had all the same brilliance this early on. Brief Encounter is a respectable and intelligent drama about a serious subject matter, especially for it's time period. As far on movies with the subject of infidelity, this was much better than Unfaithful, which was good but more of a Hollywood dramatization. Brief Encounter is a realistic portrayal of the guilt behind infidelity. The script makes it realistic by making Laura paranoid in the right way. When she feels guilty and paranoid, it's irrational. She'll think that people she doesn't even know can tell she's having an affair just by looking at her. She'll refuse to make eye contact with them. And she'll come up with elaborate alibis when it's not even necessary. It's the narration that's used to hear Laura's thoughts that really sells the paranoia. And there's no huge twist. Just a woman dealing with the guilt of cheating on her husband. I really liked that the movie never gives an excuse for her actions. Her husband is a perfectly normal guy. There are no marital problems between them. He's not an idiot or a jerk. I wouldn't have wanted to see this if the movie was about her reasons for having an affair. The movie's not about her justifying her actions, just dealing with them. An absolutely astonishing early film for David Lean.",

            "content": "David Lean's mastery of film technique is much in evidence in this quite remarkable film version of Noel Coward's play Still Life. In taking a short, stagebound piece of work and crafting it into an intriguingly non-linear, involving, deeply moving romantic drama, Lean serves up one of the very best British films of all-time; a masterclass of acting, mood, lighting, editing and photography. It would take a pretty strong heart not to get caught up by the love dilemma at the heart of the film; it's such a heartfelt piece of storytelling, so real, so honest, so easy to relate to. In the role that made him a star Trevor Howard is magnificent (he was never better in all his long career); and Celia Johnson conveys her emotions and inner turmoil quite brilliantly.Neglected housewife Laura (Celia Johnson) habitually frequents the nearby town of Milford every Thursday. She rides in by train, does her shopping, goes to see a movie, then has a drink at the station before returning home. One Thursday, quite by chance, she meets a young and enthusiastic doctor named Alec (Trevor Howard) at Milford Station. As if fated, they cross paths several times more and it quickly becomes apparent there is much more than just a casual acquaintance between them. Despite both being already married, they fall in love with each other almost instantly; and must face the horrible fact they can never truly be together as they have made their beds elsewhere. The film charts their blossoming romance and the devastating realisation that they're trapped in a love affair which can never end in true happiness.The film is, at its core, a story of two ideally suited lovers who have already married and started families with someone else. It's such a simple, unsophisticated story it terms of plot\u0085 but the real sophistication comes into effect via the brilliant examination of their aching emotional turmoil, the internal moral tug-of-war they undergo as they try to make sense of the consequences of this life-changing brief encounter. By mixing up the story chronology \u2013 starting almost at the end, then tracking back to the start of the affair \u2013 Lean cannily draws us in to the heartbreaking plight of the distraught couple. The music (by Rachmaninov), plus Robert Krasker's evocative photography, are merely the icing on this most delectable of cakes. Brief Encounter is, quite simply, one of the true greats and absolutely MUST be seen by any serious movie lover.",

            "content": "Filmed in 1944 while World War II was still raging and while London was barely recovering from bombings by German aircraft, director David Lean and writer Noel Coward's \"Brief Encounter\" remains a poignant film 60 years later. Recently, it was featured on cable's Turner Movie Classics and is also available on a fine DVD. It stars an all British cast- Celia Johnson and Trevor Howard head up the cast as Laura and Alec, would-be lovers who are married to other people but meet regularly to catch different trains in a train station. They naturally fall in love and are tempted to engage in an affair but the line of friendship is never truly crossed and they don't physically consummate their feelings. Now, of course, this is due to the powerful censorship in London at this time. Sex was a taboo subject even to married couples, even though Kinsey was at this time making his famous investigations and interviews on human sexuality. But also these are frigid, repressed British folk. Celia Johnson is not attractive (she is sickly thin and her eyes indicate she never got any sleep or something) and Trevor Howard is old looking and has haggard teeth (so does she) and their physicality is never really quite hot but it's a good film. It's moody, romantic and slow-moving. They watch films together, go boating together, and the structure is interesting. Laura narrates the tale of her \"affair of the heart\" as if she is recalling the past, writing it in her diary or even telling it to her husband. However, this can also get annoying. She's very talkative and a lot of times she is saying a lot of nothing. Her use of language was probably common or regional in parts of England. While men can still enjoy this classic movie, for it never really bores the audience, this film is clearly a woman's film. Celia Johnson is speaking on behalf of British women and she seems to be the incarnation of a romantic heroine from paperback romances that women read at the time. While there is no actual adultery, they have already \"cheated\" on each other's spouses in their hearts. Above all, this is an emotional affair. This quiet, intimate, reflective movie is a different animal from the huge, panoramic epics that director David Lean is most famous for - the 1962 classic Lawrence of Arabia and 1965's Doctor Zhivago. David Lean's early films were mostly films like this one. A great movie classic. Enjoy.",

And yet, it's almost a two-character film, with Johnson and Howard carrying most of the story with only an occasional turn from STANLEY HOLLOWAY for a touch of humor in some of the train station scenes and JOYCE CAREY as a gossipy train companion.It's almost a time capsule of a much simpler time--during postwar WWII--no television, no cellphones, just crossword puzzles and knitting for our two main characters--and, of course movies. During much of the narration, it occurred to me how much Celia Johnson sounds like Deborah Kerr--same pitch of voice, same intonation.Summing up: A simple love story with a bittersweet ending, nicely understated without any melodramatic outbursts of passion, with Johnson winning a Best Actress award from the N.Y. Film Critics, but losing the Oscar to Olivia de Havilland of TO EACH HIS OWN.",

            "content": "A masterpiece of proverbial British civility and restraint. Beneath those respectable exteriors-- the impeccable grammar, the gentile politeness-- passions catch fire and come to a boil with all the driving force of the steam engines that barrel through the dingy station where the lovers meet. Johnson and Howard are near perfect as bored spouses on the edge of adultery. But then they are thoroughly middle-class with family responsibilities, even as the romantic strains of Rachmaninoff insist otherwise. Rarely has social convention been confronted by personal passion more intensely than here. I get the feeling that were the movie made today, a satirical version would appear on Saturday Night Live the following week. Nonetheless, the results rise above standard soap suds thanks to the consummate skills of director Lean, cinematographer Krasker, and the cast principals. Note that opening scene in the seedy station with the gabby woman. Watch the nuanced and beautifully choreographed expressions from Johnson and Howard as they fall back on inbred civility to defuse a difficult intrusion. It's a minor masterpiece of repressed emotion.For all the attention to detail, the movie does cheat. Did they have to make Johnson's husband such a comfortable dullard, such that her straying passion seems more an act of personal survival than questionable infidelity. Note too, how the lovers are stopped short of genuine adultery by the inopportune arrival of Howard's friend, the insufferable Stephan, (who also provides insight into why Howard wants escape). Anyway, I expect mores of the time dictated that Johnson could be forgiven her intentions as long as there were no actual consummation. Thus her \"punishment\" need not go beyond an emotional defeat.All in all, the movie strikes me as rather threatening to the sedate middle-class, suggesting as it does that beneath calm appearance, lies unrequited passion waiting to break the bonds of societal repression into some unknown but more daring future. I doubt that some such theme will ever get more delicate treatment than here.",

I should like to comment on two lines of dialogue and perhaps address young Americans right at the start.I am an American, thirty-eight year-old man living in Maryland and to any American under the age of forty a brief note: I am tired of hearing, \"what's the big deal?\" Now, you have as much right to your opinions as I have mine. Still, what you may have missed was the warmth of each significant character; even Beryl pours a drink for a visibly shaken Laura. The impeccable tact of the major characters, the discretion evinced, or the unpredictable nature of timing (a major theme in \"Brief Encounter\")and perhaps you didn't quite soak in enough of the warmth which pervades the film. View \"Brief Encounter\" twenty years from now and see if your opinion has changed.\"It's awfully easy to lie when you're trusted implicitly\" says Laura in voice-over. That line is a bodkin to the soul. ALL of us know what the line means, ALL of us know how shatteringly true the line is. And thank God the line is not spoken by Laura in a didactic way.Much has been made about the cast selection. Celia Johnson and Trevor Howard, both inspired choices, are credible as soon as we see them. They are not Madeline Carroll and Errol Flynn. Big deal. (Of course,  Flynn and Carroll would have failed in these roles).Here are the boldest pieces of the film; the fact that Laura was going to willingly make love with Alec and was thwarted by the return of Alec's room mate; Laura in voice-over, \"I'd like to say it was the thought of you and the children that stopped me (from jumping in front of a rapidly moving express train) but it wasn't!\" and a few others. \"I felt like a criminal,\" says Laura in voice-over. She's no criminal but we know what she means.The film, intended or not, is about Laura. Whether she's tipping the barrel organist for playing, \"Let the Great Big World Keep Turning,\" or telling Alec \"Self-respect matters and decency matters...\" this is Laura's film.\"Thank you for coming back to me.\" Laura's husband ends the film. As far as tears go, that line does me in every time. Did he somehow know about Laura and Alec? Many say he did. I say, \"does it really make any difference?\"",

I feel there is a lot of manipulation in it, dictated by the cage of Post-WW2 behaviour and morality. Both Celia Johnson as Laura and Trevor Howard as Alec are in unsuitable marriages, and selflessly they both give up a chance of fulfillment. Yes, they both have children, and there would be a scandal, but both David Lean and Noel Coward sadistically keep them in their separate cages for the rest of their lives. For the sake of the taboos of the times they will suffer, and being already in early middle age it does not need a clairvoyant to see they will remain suffering for the rest of their lives. This film is not a weepie with an 'honourable' ending harking back to Victorian times (the remnants of which lasted well into the late 1950's) but a repressive look at marital masochism. Louis Malle blew this myth away in 'Les Amants' when he showed how both lovers attempt happiness and will at the end of the film have the courage of attaining it, knowing full well that society and convention will impose guilt upon them. This was in 1958, and the cage was still there even in France which however was arguably less repressive than the UK with its continuing vicious 'moral' and anti-gay laws. Could and would the UK have been able to make a similar film as 'Les Amants'? I doubt it. WW2 did not open up new ways of living in the UK, as its conservatism did not allow it, and its everlasting 'moral honour' would have prevented it. 'Brief Encounter' in its need to enforce this conservatism did not bring hope to British cinema, but only cemented its rigid codes for at least a decade and a half after. Those who despair at this analysis will even now not approve of this analysis but I believe films should be put into an historical perspective. Despite Celia Johnson's superlative acting and Trevor Howard's brave upper lip, I consider this film as a warning to never return to those times again (which is possible), and to see it for what it is; an excellently directed and well-filmed portrayal of an era of profound self-oppression, and for that reason it will sadly last as being a masterpiece. The final scenes induce questionable tears which I personally recoil from, but which by force of manipulation inevitably flow. They need not have flowed and are there to satisfy complacent minds. Rachmaninov's ' Piano Concerto 2 ' in its melancholia only heightens what is happening in the foreground and was imposed upon the film by Noel Coward.",

Valentine Dyall plays a doctor acquaintance of Alec's who learns of the forbidden romance and makes his opinion known. Directed by David Lean with a clever screenplay that is insightful despite being, at times, corny.

The musical score by Rachmaninof is exquisite. Unless you just hate classical-style music, you'll really appreciate the beauty of the score and how it complements the film--not overwhelms it. Also, the cinematography is great--lots of great angles, shots and care. The writing was also very good--the story and dialog were well-crafted. And finally, it was very refreshing to see such ordinary (and perhaps unattractive in the case of Celia Johnson) people in a love story. I just can't imagine Hollywood casting Trevor Howard as a romantic lead! Now, what I didn't like. The basic story is glamorizing extramarital affairs, as the basic plot involves two married people falling for another. I COULD have accepted this is their spouses had been monsters. We don't know about Trevor's, but Celia's husband, though a little dull, loves her dearly and seems like a very decent guy. So this left me thinking much less of Celia as a character--she's looking outside her marriage with little apparent motivation other than possible selfishness. Secondly, although I am sure this film is adored by most women, I venture to guess many guys will be left cold--I know I was. This reminded me of the incredibly over-hyped An Affair To Remember, though Brief Encounter was a generally superior film.It would have been interesting to see how the film would have handled by anyone other than David Lean and Noel Coward. The French would have probably had some nudity and the characters NEVER would have struggled over the indecency of the affair. American studios, in the 1940s, would have probably drastically re-written the story or not attempted it at all. Ingmar Bergman would have had the characters either go mad or kill themselves!",

            "content": "The director known for his epic spectacles, such as \"Lawrence of Arabia\" and \"Bridge on the River Kwai\", began his career quite differently. This intimate and simple romantic drama tells quite an ordinary story of two quite ordinary people, ordinary-looking, who lead ordinary lives and whose paths cross by chance. They fall in love, but as they are both in marriages with children, their love must not be realized. There is nothing spectacular about this story and all you will see in this film millions of people experience every day. Technically, the film also isn't anything special. Leading roles are interpreted by Celia Johnson, a television actress with only a few films in her career, and Trevor Howard, to whom this is the first serious role. However, these two, with the help of David Lean's excellent directing, managed to bring to life emotion so powerful that, from this potentially mediocre film, it made an unforgettable masterpiece of the genre. If you have never been in love with all your being, there is a real chance that you'll find \"Brief Encounter\" totally uninteresting, but if you at least once experienced this pervading feeling... still, you better skip it, because it will rip you apart. And the ending... oh my God.10/10\"Simple, honest, and unforgettable.\" - Harold Robbins",

And I think many of us have had a person for whom we had passion but we knew that something wasn't right and if we continued, it would end with great sadness.\nI remember once watching this movie with middle aged Brits who laughed and said, \"No English person speaks this way. And furthermore, none ever did.\" That is sort of missing the point. There are scenes and characters throughout that show the class system in British Culture. There are moments when the middle class shows mocking affection for the workers yet at the same time feels sincere pity for them. The working class always feels superior to all others, they do not fear showing their contempt..\nAs many times as I have seen this movie, it is never easy. I am going to be wiped out when it is over, so I gotta be prepared.\nAs a young person, it was a bore, at 30, I realized it was genius.",

This is the last and most celebrated of the four, a simple love story marked with the visual elegance that would be the trademark of the director. Howard is fine as the doctor while Johnson's performance as the woman is rather uneven. The score consists solely of Rachmaninov's Second Piano Concerto, and while it adds a wistful quality to the film, it is somewhat overused. Based on a play by Coward, the dialog is at times a bit trite, more apt for a teen romance than an adult drama. The narration is at times superfluous.",

The different ways of reading this film are plentiful too. A gay love story made acceptable by transferring the male/male relationship to a male/female one. The images of the trains going through tunnels, the progress of Alec and Laura on the boat being stopped by a bridge etc. It's all semi-plausible and always such a pleasure to watch.

            "content": "David Lean, one of the greatest British film directors, made \"Brief Encounter\" (1945) long before he became world famous for celebrated epics like \"Lawrence of Arabia\" (1962), \"Doctor Zhivago\" (1965) or \"The Bridge on the River Kwai\" (1957). Does the mastery of these later works show in this early flic already? You bet! And what's even more impressive is that a romance as we experience it here is far removed from Lean's later works, and it nevertheless succeeds in its own right. Sure, in comparison to the later monumental films \"Brief Encounter\" might look like a small, rather unimpressive black and white affair at first glance - well, at least that's the impression you might have before you've actually seen it. To put the record straight: \"Brief Encounter\" is a gem, a true classic. Despite the plot appears to be based on a clich\u00e9 taken from a dime novel. For dealing with a fleeting relationship against all norms has rarely been shown in such a deeply moving way that can tackle walking the fine line between tear-jerking sentimentality and heartfelt sincerity. Time and characters might be dated, the film's impact clearly is not.The tale of \"Brief Encounter\" is simple: A middle aged housewife who is securely married with children makes the acquaintance of a doctor, whose situation isn't much different. It's perfectly clear from the beginning that whatever might develop between these two cannot succeed under the restraints of the society they're living in. So how can the liaison continue? Where can it lead? Well, to a brilliant psychological study and a breathtaking film. David Lean explores this forbidden relationship in such a suspenseful and gripping way that his inventive cinematography succeeds in making one feel dizzy when reality finally begins to tilt... Of course it's primarily David Lean who knows how to tell a story (see e.g. also his Dickens adaptations \"Oliver Twist\" or \"Great Expectations\"), but the two leads, Celia Johnson and Trevor Howard, play so well off each other that they completely make the film their own. And by the way: It's refreshing to see someone like Celia Johnson in the lead, an actress that lacks the otherwise common great looks for a change and thus alongside her talent helps to make the film work. High recommendation!",

            "content": "This is such a sad little movie about two people who don't know that they're missing anything in their lives and then find each other to discover that which they are missing in the other person. It's a view into a new life for both of them, only for it all to come to an end and for them to return to the lives they had before. This lack of permanence is the core of the film, and feeds well into David Lean's Summertime, which I ended up watching a few days later. I suppose I should write my thoughts on that one too at some point.One of the interesting things about the story's structure is that it plays out as a confession from Laura Jesson to her husband, but the confession is entirely in her head as they sit in their small sitting room and he does the crossword after a long day. She's unburdening herself of the affair she just finished with Dr. Alec Harvey, a general practitioner she meets at Milford on her Thursday excursions to buy groceries and take in a movie. The key to this movie's success is the very strong relationship that builds between Laura and Alec. They are both happy in their little lives, and then the new person gets introduced and they feel like they've been missing something. Laura is warmer than Alec's wife, and Alec is more exciting than Laura's husband.But the relationship is a slow build. He helps her get some grit out of her eye, then they find themselves in a crowded restaurant for lunch and share a table. It's a series of small steps that mostly center around the small train station at Milford where they wait for their respective trains that go in opposite directions. They steadily get to know each other and like each other to the point that they profess their love for each other. That steady build and tight focus on their relationship is really what makes the whole emotional journey work.When reality seeps in and the two decide that their relationship cannot continue, Alec takes a job in South Africa, essentially running away while also finding a way to advance his career from just being a general practitioner. Laura understands him to a certain extent, but she can't quite accept it. She gets thrown into despair, and when their final goodbye gets cut short by a busybody acquaintance of Laura's, they don't even get their last words, just a quick tip of the hat. This was actually where the movie began, but the scene played out from the acquaintance's perspective. We saw Laura disappear from the table and out of the little tea shop only to return moments later with a thin excuse. Now, late in the film, we see how deep her sadness had run and that she was close to suicide in the face of the reality of losing Alec.But that's not where she was when she started her internal confession. She was in her sitting room with her husband, her genial and clueless husband, who embraces her warmly when she breaks down into tears and refuses an explanation. In the final moments of the film, she gets a firm reminder of what made her so content before she met Alec, and it's the good man who was doing the crossword on the other side of the room. That moment where Laura melts into her husband's arms after nearly running away from him to chase a dream is the height of the film for me.I would have considered the temporal nature of the relationship interesting, but the same basic concept playing out in Summertime makes me think that this was something that interested Lean as a filmmaker, pointing me towards the final section of Lawrence of Arabia where peace instantly breaks down or the final moments of Bridge on the River Kwai where Alec Guinness's Lieutenant Colonel Nicholson realizes what he had built for the enemy. This idea of temporary emotions giving way for more permanent situations seems to be an idea close to Lean's heart, and something I'll have to keep an eye out for.Brief Encounter, though, is a touching little film about brief emotions and how they can linger and even fade over time. Over the course of Laura's internal confession, she feels everything she felt, and in the end, she finds that she can begin to move on. It's a wonderful little film that expertly uses sight and sound to create its series of emotions and sell them to the audience.",

            "content": "I am no doubt biased in writing about this film, because it is my all time favourite, and has been for many years. But I only recently had the chance to see it on the big screen for the first time, and the experience has left me dazed ..again.  Previously, when I had seen the film on television or on video I had marvelled at the precision of David Lean's direction, the complex simplicity of the story, the mastery of No\u00ebl Coward's fairness to his characters and the marvllous use of music in unfolding and reflecting the narrative. Seeing Brief Encounter in a cinema made me far more aware of the subtleness of the acting than before, and of course Robert Krasker's brilliant cinemaphotography. I cannot praise Celia Johnsen's performance enough -the truth in her eyes at every moment of the story becomes so much more impressive when experienced on the big screen. Both her performance, and that of Trevor Howard are wonderfully contained -searching, unsure, and above all vulnerable. It is, for me at least, the vulnerability of their relationship that is the core of the film's appeal and longevity. It is their reasoning and attempt to resolve their dilemma which intrigues us, but it is as much the telling of the story that fascinates as the story itself. Big screen viewing allows appreciation of detail. Note the many signs that adorn the background throughout the film -signs displaying names of places far away, which seem to heighten the theme of transition; of the constant attraction towards other places to everywhere but where we happen to be. Note the word 'Room' displayed back to front in the cafe window as Laura at the height of her despair wonders whether to og back to Alec's borrowed flat. The word reads as; MOOR, and conjectually 'more room' is precisely what Laura needs at that moment. Other details that help weld the theme of transition and change are  the frequent uses of clocks to denote anxiety.  Clocks and watches represent the inevitablity of life -Time cannot, alas, be frozen at moments of happiness. Each shot of a clock or timepiece heightens this. Most revealing is the choice of present Laura makes for her husband -a desk clock with a barometer (another signal of change). The clock plays a part in the deception she creates -telling a story about having to travel some way in order to buy it, while actually spending time with Alec, and is also a persistent metaphor for the urgency of making the best use of  time while one can. The obvious symbols of trains traveling in opposite directions as separate destinies and the railway station as the crossing point have been well documented, but manage to grip our attention and imagination every time. The railway station itself, though not glamourised in any way, manages to evoke incredibly romantic images in it's ordinariness. And the sounds of trains moving, continuously, and the other noises of the station -bells, clanks, the rattle of coffee-cups etc all intrude upon the attempts the two protagonists have of being alone in quiet. In sum there is no film I know that manages so well to marry the various elements of film making with film aesthetics, is more successful in marryings narrative, theme and sub-text in technical use of sound, lighting, editing, photography and music. It is a total film experience, where appreciation of the whole never ends, and where -upon each new viewing- new insight is given into it's myriad of parts.",

            "content": "This is not a film that makes you leave the cinema with a spring in your step, or with a more hopeful view on life. Brief Encounter is a film about despair, guilt, and a desperate longing to liberate yourself from an endless cage. The film begins and ends with an inevitably doomed romance - a romance that is is shrouded in guilt; a romance that is fueled by an intangible desire to pursue, but is shackled by the shame of your actions. A romance that is destined to fail, never to last.Despite that, Brief Encounter has to be one of the most emotionally-poignant pieces of art that I have ever experienced.The film begins at the end - a doctor bidding a brief and emotionally-hollow farewell to a woman he'll never see again. There seems to be a palpable sense of despair between the couple as they depart unceremoniously; as an audience, we don't know how or why these emotions came to fruition. Our questions are then answered by the following scenes, supplemented by the protagonist's (Laura) narration.I must admit, I wasn't a fan of the narration style at first. As Laura shamefully narrates her cherished, yet guilt-ridden moments with the doctor, it struck me that the narration wasn't intended for the audience. The narration itself is a confession - but the worst part, is that the confession is intended for her husband, however Laura cannot ever tell him of her secret relationship with the doctor. This self-contained confession accentuates the film's themes of repression, thus the narration serves a very definitive purpose.Repressed guilt and self-eroding despair. That is the unfortunate reality for Laura and Alec; those are the two emotions that shackle their relationship from truly blooming; their romance engulfed in guilt and shame - from beginning to end. I found this to be such a striking contrast: their unmeasured love for each other, framed against their shackling guilt of loving each other.And that is why the film's beginning is so impactful - we know the ending of the story: an unceremonious and despairing farewell. The result of structuring the story like this, is that there is a great sense of pain and despair pervading the film from the beginning right to end; constructing a heart-wrenching experience that the audience must endure and experience.I should also mention the effectiveness of (one of) the film's settings: a train station. It is a place where trains come and go; a great sense of futility and a lack of purpose in a seemingly endless cycle. As Laura pondered in an early monologue: \"There'll come a time in the future when I shan't mind about this anymore, when I can look back and say quite peacefully and cheerfully how silly I was. No, no, I don't want that time to come ever. I want to remember every minute, always, always to the end of my days\". Life is big, towering and imposing. Alec, the doctor, is an idealist with great ambitions; I myself strive to live a big and satisfying life, but what I learned from the film is to appreciate the small and fleeting moments in our lives - the brief encounters. Life is short - no feelings last a long while; appreciate the flickering moments that are happening in front of your eyes right now.That is what Brief Encounter is to me: a film that aches and oozes with unadulterated beauty. It's a film about repressed guilt and shame in the face of an ultimately doomed romance, the shackling feeling of bottling up your emotions, feeling trapped and unhappy for a reason you cannot understand. The film is abundant in striking contrast: Love and Shame, Hope and Futility. Brief Encounter is truly a tremendous piece of art, one that I have been so glad to have experienced.",

            "content": "Films which have weak plots and characterizations sometimes score points for atmosphere due to strong technical aspects which often feature great cinematography. Such is the case with Brief Encounter, an earlier effort from iconic director David Lean based on a one-act play by Noel Coward.The film is a chronicle of an extramarital affair between a physician Dr. Alec Harvey (Trevor Howard) and a housewife Laura Jesson (Celia Johnson). A good part of the film takes place inside a train station which sports a caf\u00e9 that sells coffee and pastries. The film has expanded single train station setting of the play to additional locations referenced in Coward's work. .The brief encounter refers to the short first-time meeting between Alec and Laura where he helps her remove an irritant which has gotten in her eye. But the \"encounter\" actually lasts over a month on successive Thursdays, the day in which both the newly minted \"lovers\" have matching intersecting schedules where they soon catch trains heading in opposite directions.The characters and plot are quite insubstantial. Despite being married, Alec and Laura \"fall in love\" for unexplained reasons. In other words, their falling in love is a given. We're treated to their proclamations of love for one another ad infinitum. At a certain point it becomes tiresome.The film keeps your interest because ultimately, we want to know what happens to the relationship. But along the way there are too many perfunctory scenes with little suspense: Alec missing an appointment; Laura's son sustaining a concussion after being side swiped by a car; a colleague becoming incensed after Alec uses his apartment where he has a short rendezvous with Laura; a slight boating mishap in which Alec gets his pants wet; Laura's sympathetic husband comforting her over her depressed mood and the gossipy acquaintance that constantly annoys the besotted housewife during one of her many reveries.The narrative is also seriously compromised by the overuse of voiceover narration as Laura explains her dilemma to the audience.One other curious thing about the film is that Alec and Laura's affair appears to be unconsummated. Despite some kissing there is only one scene in which they are alone together inside a house and Laura must run out after Alec's colleague appears.Noel Coward's theme here is forbidden love and I suppose while the intimacy is never suggested, it's more important for Coward to get across the idea that rebellion against the social order is not necessarily a bad thing. This is in keeping with the fact that Coward was alleged to be a closeted gay man.Some reviewers here were put off by Alec and Laura's lack of morals, conducting an affair in which they were bringing shame upon themselves for betraying their spouses. But keep in mind (especially in Laura's case), she makes no bones about her feelings of guilt over conducting the affair. And ultimately, they both decide to call it off as they realize that it will not work.I am not sure if Brief Encounter could have been made in the 30s when the play was written. But after having gone through most of World War II, the idea of an extramarital affair was no longer as scandalous to the general British public as it might have been prior to the war.In addition to the heady atmosphere, I would recommend Brief Encounter simply because of the cinematography. David Lean masterful feel for creating compelling visual scenes is on display here. You will be impressed by the variety of shots and lighting that makes you feel you're viewing a work of art!I was not impressed by Trevor Howard who I imagined could be much better in a role as say a by-the-book army officer than a doctor specializing in preventive medicine. I liked Celia Johnson much better than Howard whose backstory is weak. For those who say Johnson is plain-looking I would strongly disagree-in her heyday she appears to have been quite attractive! The supporting players inside the station and on the train also add to the film's atmosphere but their machinations are quite peripheral to the main story.I would recommend taking a look at Brief Encounter as It certainly has attained an iconic status over the years. But in terms of the characters and plot it's no doubt decidedly overrated. See it for the marvelous visuals!",

            "content": "My title concerns rather the younger generation, too absorbed in watching \"Sin City\" and other dismaying commercial and violent flick to give a chance to anything in black&white.Although, Brief Encounter has a stunning cinematography: the shots of the trains and the steam from the engines in the station, and the very inspired and very modern direction of Lean, considering the date (1946): particularly the close shot of Mrs Messiter when she never stops speaking, or the camera leaning slowly on the side as an effect of collapse to reinforce the drama when Laura feels overwhelmed by Alec's departure. Amazing.The soundtrack is using the gorgeous second concerto of Rachmaninov. Some critics may say that the over use of music hides the imperfections of a script or a direction: it may be true most of the time but not here. The film is an excellent example of a 20th century Romantic love story (Romantic with capital R as the movement of the 19th century). Thus, it may appear a little outdated here, as most of people may unfortunately not make such a big deal about cheating relationships nowadays. However the guilt still exists and the movie strikes a very modern chord in this point of view.The acting is excellent and I recommend the movie to anybody interested in the art of cinema. This is a much better love story than the later \"Summertime\" also by David Lean, with Katharine Hepburn (this one, extremely out of date).",

And maybe it is. I found myself having trouble paying attention, and I really did not get as much out of it as I should have. Lean does good work, and there is no reason to believe this is not on that list.The one thing I will say is that it stands out as one of Lean's shorter films. Maybe more of his films are 90 minutes than over two hours, but he does seem to have an attraction to the epic storyline. I am pleased to say this is not one of those (not to say they are not good in their own right, but sometimes you just do not have a full afternoon or evening to invest in a film).",

True love is formed by shared experiences, deep bonds and understanding of the other person. This supposed great love is formed over a few hours of brief, superficial, polite, flirtatious banter. Anything else is lust, which I also can't fathom as neither one is particularly attractive, physically or emotionally. The scene in the pub between the owner and the 2 men is pointless. The scene where she almost commits suicide but doesn't and then admits no thoughts of her children or husband made her stop is weird. I don't have children but from my understanding that is certainly not typical of mothers. The most baffling aspect is why she would go home and confess all this to her husband, which is the epitome of cruel and selfish behaviour. No wait, the most baffling aspect is probably her husbands reaction. Many people state the music it what makes this movie so good. Go by the soundtrack. The film itself is WAY over-hyped.",

            "content": "'Brief Encounter' is a movie about two people who have an elicit love affair.Released in 1945, at the end of WW2, it's quite surprising how stifled and censorious an attitude it brings to the subject. During the war years of 1939-45, so many men - including husbands - got sent off to fight, that the female population left behind were literally sex-starved. Many would open their legs for no greater price that a pair of stockings. In fact, during the build-up towards D-Day, with hundreds of thousands of comparatively rich, handsome Yanks supplanted over-here, over paid, and over-sexed; the issue became one of genuine political concern. By the time hostilities ended, almost 60,000 British women had found American husbands. And that could only have been the tiniest tip of a hanky-panky iceberg.How such judgemental Victorian prudery managed to almost instantly re-emerge with peacetime is therefore all the more inexplicable.Nevertheless; that's how it was. And Coward's movie encapsulates those social attitudes wonderfully well. Most of what we see entails the desperate longings, the romantic assertions and the hastily contrived liaisons. It's all very chaste. They do, in fact, get it together at least once. The only clue we see of this is when the hero is caught dressing himself in a friend's apartment (our heroine has already left). The friend has given him carte-blanche freedom of access in his own absence should he ever need it, but clearly not for the purpose of seducing married women. We see his embarrassed shame at discovery. He, after all, is single; but he has still managed to betray the trust of his best friend.Our heroine, on the other hand, is a married women, and her betrayal is of the profoundest. The adulterous relationship is a passing thing, but now she must reconcile herself to its guilt for the rest of her life.Their whole experience is largely played-out against a backdrop of railway stations and roaring trains. Moments of tenderness are as temporary as any meetings at a station, Passion surges like the powerful but anonymous locomotives. The noirish lighting is beautifully realised, frequent gloom lingers over their encounters like doomed hope. Love and loss, desire and guilt, the bittersweet paradoxes of physical joy.Towards the end of the movie, after they have parted for ever, we see the heroine at home with her husband. It's a comfortable middle-class lounge. She is half lost in her lost dream. The husband in kindly and solicitous. Perhaps he doesn't know the extent of her betrayal, but it's clear that he knows there was something and spares her feelings from undue questions.In this day and age it's almost impossible to imagine those stifling social mores of half a century ago.",

For me the brilliant examples of the old romance films are It Happened One Night, Bringing Up Baby, The Shop Around the Corner, Casablanca, Meet Me in St. Louis and many others, and Brief Encounter seems to be the first classic film of this genre that I've rated so low. The actors and the directing are quite fine, but the story is the biggest flaw of this film. It's not interesting enough. It has some dramatic moments, but it doesn't have passion. Laura doesn't look like a lonely woman, she has her loving husband and two kids. Alec in his turn is too plain and boring. I don't know, maybe there was a point in showing them so simple and common, but it doesn't do any good. They just don't look like two persons who need this affair. The film runs slightly less than an hour and a half, and for me it was as though I watched a 3-hour movie. It lacks good dialoges, interesting characters and moments. Too plain and boring to have a user rating higher than Bringing Up Baby or Meet Me in St. Louis and higher critic rating than It Happened One Night and Bringing Up Baby. Maybe some more charismatic actors could bring life in this, but we'll never know. I don't recommend Brief Encounter and advise you to watch any of the other films I listed, if you haven't seen them of course.",

But they're married, so you know this can't be a simple relationship. You think all along: can this have a happy ending, and what is a happy ending in this context? Do you even approve of the relationship?All this told with some wonderful old English settings, 1940s sensibilities and charm.Unfortunately, after this intriguing dilemma, the movie then drifts for a period and then we have a conclusion that is a damp squib.

There is a torrid love affair going on between two strangers who meet secretly at a train station. The viewerw can understand the depth of the feeling and the agony of unrequited love.Their love is hidden from family and friends and no one must ever know their real feelings, because that was the accepted convention. Thus, raging passion seems all the more engulfing because the couple accept the limits that this affair can never be intimate. The rousing music of Rachmaninoff is wonderful and rather unrestrained; however, it is somewhat strange given the understated role of the two leading characters. I was very impressed by the acting of Celia Johnson. This is a actress who performed mainly on stage and who was known to the public in few movie roles, e.g. In Which We Serve and The Prime of Miss Jean Brodie (she was outstanding in both). She is the sweet and passionate housewife whose life becomes unhinged by the presence of a caring medical doctor in the person of Trevor Howard, who steps in to give routine medical aid. From that point on,the romance becomes impossible to escape without breaking their hearts.The time and place are not at all clear because it could be set in suburban London or another English suburb in the 1930's or 40's; I found this lapse somewhat glaring but since it was made in 1946, I took that as the actual time.

            "review_title": "The British invented the chick flick?",
            "content": "This an undynamic movie filled with trivial moments, but it's dramatically trivial also. A trivial heroine meets a trivial someone (trivially, on her commute), is given carte blanche to see him by a husband portrayed as a hopeless dolt. Most of their affair occurs in a train waiting room, where their last moments together are interrupted by the trivial matters of a trivial acquaintance. She confesses the affair to the dolt who regards it trivially, & instantly takes her back. We are intended to value that; so much for conflict. The two lovers are ordinary dullards and extraordinarily unspecific. I find it disturbing that fans describe what we see as 'passion.' They have the dictionary definition of an affair, nothing more. The movie has been completely scrubbed of any unique details. The stakes are low. To hear anyone call it England's answer to Casablanca is horrifying. Casablanca has much more finely drawn characters, in an infinitely more satisfying/rousing/interesting plot. More importantly Casablanca has a structure. This does not. I was making my own impositions on the material as I watched. As Howard rowed her out in a boat, I had already rejected this as a romance and had jumped to \"woman-in-danger\" movie imposing, \"...this is where he turns out to be psychotic, takes an oar and brains her... he's actually an ingenious killer who chose her as his next victim because she's such a dullard.\" What can I say? I was ready for any form of complication.The narration is extremely mundane. It's like some sort of unworldly completest wrote it. \"... and then I blew my nose and disposed of the tissue!\" is only slightly more uninteresting than the actions she notes. Our heroine remarks that an associate has an ugly hat, while wearing quite an unflattering choo-choo-Charlie cap for the whole movie. Actors range from the merely average in looks to the quite homely. Alec (Trevor Howard) is about as attractive as James Woods, but to Laura, he represents a fantasy figure.I got more out of this by seeing it as a tiny-goaled fantasy of escape from the suffocating bourgeois structure that trained her to be uptight, AND to imagine herself a suitable heroine for a love story. But she lacks the imagination for any dramatisable, feature-film-scaled rebellion. Not being part of the British class system, I lack any larger social codex to detect the merit in this.",

While I'm not at all offended by eroticism in films, it is an incredible change of pace to see love portrayed in such a subtle and gentle way. And depending on your sensibilities, you can see it as romantic in terms of Laura's short tortured relationship with the dashing Alex or her deep friendship with somewhat dull husband, Fred. The story wonderfully explores the idea that sometimes it is easier to feel close and understood by someone you meet by chance as opposed to those who are close to us.

I wasn't really sad at the end (purportedly 1940s audiences were audibly sobbing at the end) and was always aware that I was watching two actors acting.

            "content": "The genius of Noel Coward is combining fluent dialogue with a complete acknowledgement of the characters and their feelings: he takes them seriously. The witty remarks are there to uncover a deeper, thoroughly unwitty truth. He shows us the morals, but never becomes a moralist.In this beautifully crafted script, there is no wit. The woman in the bar at the train station and her admirer have the snappy dialogue to juxtapose the tender, almost sentimental conversations of the heroine and her hero. But they mirror the troubled love of Laura and Alec: they can have a relationship starting any minute if they only would acknowledge their love. Alec and Laura utter their love, but can't have a relationship: there is simply too much at stake.Anyone who has been in love, fiercely, relentlessly, knows what Laura and Alec are going through. Their falling in love is not the bored housewife with the flirty doctor. It's finding something you didn't know were looking for, and as you find it you don't understand how you ever could do without it. They don't fall in love because they are unhappy in their present lives. They fall in love because they understand each other perfectly, and more important, feel understood by the other person. It is beautiful irony that the aspects of their personalities that make it impossible to continue the affair are the ones that they appreciate the most. The fact that Laura is so haunted by the affair is why Alec loves her. The gallantry of leaving for Africa to give them both their freedom back, is why Laura is so attracted to Alec. For modern audiences the thought might rise: just leave both your spouses and get on with it. But their moral standard, not to throw away something good for something better, not making five or six people unhappy for your own careless happiness, is something to strive for, even now.The fact that their affair is presented as something that imprisons them instead of a liberation maybe the only moralistic point in this movie. They kiss, multiple times, and probably would have gone further had Alec's friend not returned too early.The techniques that director David Lean uses are highly symbolic but they're realistic at the same time. It keeps par with Coward dialogue, equally symbolic. As with the last lines of Laura's husband who says: you were far off in that dream, but I'm glad you came back. That sentence sums up the movie, the affair, the relationship with her husband. But for him it's something he says to comfort his wife. Love is never easy, but as hard as it's presented here with such a tender pen, makes you realise why it's the most important thing in the world.",

            "review_title": "A mature depiction of an extra-marital affair !!!",
            "content": "'Brief Encounter' is a film from the initial part of David Lean's career as a filmmaker when he was majorly known for being the most skilled director at interpreting Noel Coward's plays on celluloid. The screenplay of 'Brief Encounter' written by Lean himself along with Ronald Neame and Anthony Havelock-Allan is based on Coward's play 'Still Life'. The film spreads out the play and expands on it. Unlike Lean's more popular works like 'Lawrence of Arabia' or 'The Bridge on the River Kwai', 'Brief Encounter' is a much more contained film with a smaller scope. But for me the film is as special as Lean's more grander works due to its intimate storytelling and mature depiction of an extra-marital affair.I think there are a few hints in the film about how suffocating the uptight nature of British middle/upper class society could be at the time. But to be honest, the social commentary is very nuanced and the major aspect that Lean is interested in is the exploration of the characters, especially Laura. The film is interested in focusing on the struggle that Laura goes through while balancing a sense of guilt along with desire. Most generic films that deal with extra- marital affairs resort a little too much to steamy sexual scenes for depicting the passion between the participants which invariably ends up being nothing but a source of the audience's titillation without saying anything about the characters. 'Brief Encounter' on the other hand is based solely on the characters' inner struggles. David Lean never judges them for their actions. There is a humane sense with which Laura and Alec get treated. These characters know that what they are getting into has no future, but the circumstances and tender nature in which they treat each other makes it impossible for them to resist each other's company.Lean also beautifully shows the difference between the grander scheme of things and the individual problems and struggles. A person can be going through the most traumatic experience, but it might not be of any significance in the bigger picture. This theme is brilliantly depicted in the first scene. We enter the railway station tea stall. We see the ancillary characters in the story talking to each other. Suddenly the camera pans away from them and moves to a table where Laura and Alec are sitting. We don't know them yet. We don't even hear what they are saying to each other, their conversation gets drowned by the other conversations being held in the room. It's only when we enter the psyche of Laura which happens later in the film that we truly get to understand the gravity of that first scene. Lean's direction from a basic technical standpoint has to be admired too along with the way he handles the theme of the story and his actors. He remains nuanced in his way of using the camera. Whenever Lean wants us to know what Laura is thinking, he approaches Laura ever so gently with the camera along with the dimming of the lights in the shot. There is a scene where a sudden change in mood makes the camera tilt to the right, as the tension settles, the camera tilts back to its normal straight position. Lean also does something that I love, he stages one particular scene twice, but from different perspectives. It always impresses me when a director is able to pull this storytelling technique off properly and Lean does so with flying colours.From an acting sense, the film has good performances all round, but the only actor that deserves a special mention is Celia Johnson. She is the one who drives this film forward. She is very subtle, very expressive and brilliantly portrays the struggle of Laura. She makes it impossible for the audience to not feel for Laura. Her voice-over is also brilliant.If I have to nit-pick, I'll say that maybe the voice-over in some scenes could have been more discreetly used. In certain scenes I thought, the emotional effect would have been more powerful if what Laura is thinking wasn't completely told to the audience, but it really is a very minor complaint.I'll end this review by reaffirming my appreciation for 'Brief Encounter'. This is an example of a mature piece of filmmaking where the director fleshes out the central character completely in front of you. Highly recommended.",

I have the film on tape, English Pal, VHS, and would be happy to make a copy if needed.Celia Johnson has quite protruding eyes in several scenes, and if Trevor Howard was anything of a doctor perhaps he would have diagnosed an over active thyroid!Remembered also for the musical score which used Rachmaninoff's 2nd Concerto in G to such popular effect.A lovely film, worthy of any collection.",

            "content": "I have a hard time reviewing this movie. It causes many mixed emotions - but perhaps that was the intent of the writer and director. This tale reminds me somewhat of \"Bridges Of Madison County\", in that a bored housewife can so quickly find herself falling for a complete stranger. Also in both movies, the women had decent nice husbands, although a little on the boring, safe side - which makes the unfaithfulness all the more difficult to justify. Of course there is the huge difference in that BOMC results is a consummated adulterous affair, whereas BE does not - and of course that is probably due to a reflection in the times they were made (1945 vs.1995). But both movies are the same in that they ultimately do the right thing in the end and stay with their husbands. I'm still actually surprised that a 40's movie tackled the subject of an affair so openly. I guess it was considered okay provided the end result was the saving of the marriage...I don't know since that was way before my time.I found the cinematography quite beautiful and sweeping in the imagery conveyed - especially the train station scenes with the smoke were quite beautiful in black and white. I also loved that the music score was Rachmaninoff's Piano concerto No.2 - one of the most romantic pieces ever composed.My biggest downside is that I never really bought the chemistry between Johnson and Howard. I get that maybe they had purposely cast less-than attractive actors for the parts so ordinary folk could relate to them. But it made their relationship all the more unlikely in my opinion.I do think the redeeming part of the whole unfaithfulness is that she realizes ultimately that no good can come of the relationship - and is a statement for the preservation of a good, solid marriage. All marriages go through times of dull, stale, sameness - but if we all jumped ship for the first interesting bloke that comes along, where would our societies and families be? I have to say the writer and director write and present a very engaging tale. They are quite good at the melodrama and manipulating your feelings for the good or bad.I guess the bottom line is that this is perhaps viewed as a cautionary tale as something that could happen to anyone, as evidenced by Johsnon's character's own words:\"I'm an ordinary woman. I didn't think such violent things could happen to ordinary people.\"",

Anyways what's unfortunately happened, has happened!Let's get talking about this movie, it's such a very sad tale that Laura and the Doctor had to face in society where cheating was a shame to anyone finding out. I'm sure they would be afraid that their kids will be taken from them if their partner's ever found out. I honestly thought at the end, I was going to see them run away together but unfortunately, they had to call it quits when he had to go to South Africa for his new doctor job. It's just heartbreaking like you honestly would shed a few tears to see that both of them have drifted apart.Very good movie but again, it's heartbreaking \ud83d\udc94",

            "content": "Beware spoilers!In intention, it was, I believe, Coward's presentation of pre-War England to a post-War generation. He'd tried something of the sort in 'This Happy Breed', with results that were far from happy - a sort of poor man's 'Cavalcade'.In the meantime, Olivier had made his patriotic statement in 'Henry V'. Professional jealousy would be understandable.In 'Brief Encounter', we have an altogether sparer piece, in timescale and characters. For all the impact of the music - 'Rach 2' is essentially a co-star - and rather expressionistic photography of Krasker (foreshadowing his work in 'The Third Man'), it is ostensibly a domestic tale worthy of a writer such as Kate O'Brien, whose 'latest' ('Pray for the Wanderer') Laura so coveted: a rather old-fashioned story of a woman denied the belated chance of happiness by the rigid dictates of a hypocritical society. Almost a throwback to the Victorian melodrama of the 'East Lynne' type.But the quality of the film itself is calculated to excite curiosity about the characters and their society. A cascade of questions naturally ensues.What exactly is Alec doing in Milford every Thursday? For a hospital consultant to let a 'humble GP' 'take over' his patients for a day seems a rather peculiar arrangement, even for those pre-litigation-mania days. Is Laura the first woman he's picked up? After all, a doctor can always make himself useful with little domestic emergencies...How are Alec and Stephen really connected? Could it be that, in those fondly remembered days at medical school, a soign\u00e9, slightly older, student had picked up a pretty grammar school boy from the North? And been dumped in favour of a girl - Madeleine, say? (Stephen really is a thoroughly poisonous portrait of a homosexual - perhaps based on some acquaintance of Coward's?)And what of Madeleine, the only concerned party we don't see? Laura jumps eagerly on Alec's description of her as 'delicate' to suppose her to be some sort of invalid - a wonderfully catty moment! - by implication, unable to satisfy him sexually. But isn't it likely that he has painted a self-servingly unflattering portrait? Is she quite the doormat he makes her out to be - so subservient as to jump on a liner to South Africa at the snap of his fingers? The South African story also deserves some thought. Isn't it all too convenient - that a new hospital in Jo'burg should be starting up - AND his brother is in a position to give him a job - just at the time he needs a funk-hole into which to escape? (The sort of over-convenient coincidence of Harry Lime's 'accident' in 'The Third Man').(Incidentally, Alec shows his true colours over the South African job - when he offers not to take it if (a thoroughly distraught) Laura says she doesn't want him to.)More practical questions also arise - divorce and separation, the legal and social effects, especially on a doctor's career. Had Laura run away with Alec, in 1939, she would have had to count on losing her children. Deception on an industrial scale would probably have been necessary to preserve his career - not to mention the threat of needing to move every time their past caught up with them. And we see how much she hates the minor deceptions she practices on Fred. Fred. Spouse-as-obstacle-to-love. Surely, he is the true villain of the piece, a barrier both to romance and female liberation...Look at the two males side by side - Fred is older, first of all: at least 40. Unlike Alec, he will most likely have seen service in the First World War, probably on the Western Front. To this may be attributed his desire for domestic tranquillity. (Not for nothing is his catchphrase 'Have it your own way'.) Alec may have seen more gore, in his professional capacity; but to pick up one's mug of tea and find floating in it the brains of someone one was just talking to - and to observe, take part in, the casual rutting in which soldier and officer alike sought, when in rest, to blot out the horrors of war - all that would have given Fred a sense of proportion about sexual passion that Alec clearly did not share.The truth is, Fred more than likely has contemplated his wife's possible infidelity long before Alec comes on the scene. She is pretty enough, for all her dowdy clothes (and silly hats). We see her flirting very winningly in the Kardomah - Fred will have witnessed similar incidents. And he probably has long concluded that it wouldn't matter - he would be hurt, he couldn't help that - but nothing would be worth breaking up the home, certainly not something as worthless as a cuckold's pride.At the end, whether the affair has been consummated or not is a matter of indifference to him. He clearly assumes it has. He has only waited to say something for fear of appearing to make her choose, whilst she is still under the influence of her passion. (A New Man of his time, indeed!)And what of that passion? Some reverse discrimination here, surely? In the case of a man in Laura's situation, wouldn't we just say he was 'thinking with his unit'?These questions are no more than examples. The railway, cinema, shops, streets are all fertile areas; comparison with 'Still Lives' is instructive; and so on.But this is no museum piece, viewable - like so much British cinema, unfortunately - only as visual archaeology. Its triumph is essentially artistic: to integrate the social document and narrative into a seamless whole, as satisfying as entertainment as it is rich as research material.",

I cannot quite relate to the parts of Stanley Holloway and Joyce Carey as the working class comic relief playing the parts of the station master and head station caf\u00e9 attendant.I did mix with `council house kids' in the playground at my primary school in the early fifties and do not remember their adult parents speaking in `mockney'.As British drama schools of this era were run by fairly left wing intellectual middle class staff, they tended to drum out the local accents and vernacular of their drama students to a received English pronunciation - what I call the `Cholomdley-Warner' school of speaking, (which I now find rather appealing after the endless kitchen-sink type dramas from the early sixties onwards).The consequence was we had actors like Audrey Hepburn trying to affect a cockney accent (My Fair Lady (1964)) but sounding false.Note-one of the best contemporary and authentic cockney accents is spoken by the actress who plays `Nan' to the Slater family in `East-Enders' on  the BBC soap.I also have a great love for the Rachmananov piano concerto no:2 in C minor, played here by Eileen Atkins and this seems to add perfectly to the emotional dimension and tone of the film, matching its general mood.Any film directed by David Lean should be seen alone for his breadth of vision, use of light and shade (e.g. effect on steam and smoke) and  the high standard of editing.'Brief Encounter' is no exception.As previous reviewers have identified, this film should be viewed in the social context of when it was filmed and its subject matter.The censor certainly had no problems here and young discerning viewers  can perhaps enjoy this film in the same way I can enjoy certain quality films of the 1930s.One of my interests is spotting the identity of bit part actors in different film roles, e.g a young Valentine Dyall (who was a foil of Spike Milligan in the 1960s).He comes back unexpectedly (as Alec's room mate) at the flat to where Alec takes Laura.Do we detect the frustrated homosexual predeliction of Coward here?If so, this could only be hinted at in 1945.The old type cinemas I remember when you saw a cartoon, Movietone News, a 'B' Feature and then the Main feature for continuous performances if you wanted, is certainly evocative, as well as the `Lyons Corner House'  type tea shops where I went as a child and a teenager, as a chess tournament venue.`Thank you for coming back to me',  the last line, is quintessentially full of British understatement and makes me suspect her husband,(a whizz at crosswords), was not so gullible as his character suggests.One regret, we do not see Alec's wife to judge for ourselves why he is considering leaving her. I rated it 8/10.",

The film has much technical merit including insight into middle-class sensibilities and the internal struggle of an ordinary woman to fulfill her family obligations.

While he may have the veneer of a good doctor, he was your typical smooth operator, full of himself and likely a serial cheat. Sadly, the way they were more than willing to betray their families made them wholly unlikable: wishy-washy and lacking moral fibre. If anyone in the film stood out, it's the patient and kind spouse, Fred. His compassion and understanding at the very end is the most noble act in this all together tawdry affair. As depressive and dishonest as the wife is, Fred is solid and loyal - proving that he is a better and stronger man. If I was rooting for true love tested, then the ending was perfect.",

            "content": "Brief Encounter/1945/***1/2Main Stars: Celia Johnson Trevor HowardDavid Lean's Brief Encounter is a huge work of art. Yes, the story sounds unoriginal: When a married woman meets a man in a railway station and they both fall in love. But the process of it is what really stood out. The main character Laura Jesson (Celia Johnson) is the dreadful looking, despondent wife who falls in love with Dr. Alec Harvey (Trevor Howard) in a railway station. They first meet when she gets something in her eye and calls someone over because her eye is in deep pain. When they first meet, they don't seem to get involved that much but they sure do spot each other and go on their ways. Laura seems somewhat paranoid and crazy at times; talking to herself on the train and that starting to laugh for no reason too thinking badly about a woman who talks too much around her. She then goes home and notices she's been gone for a while now. She didn't want her husband to think suspiciously of her because she's been cheating on him. Then she starts to imagine back at the good times she and Alec had had together. This somewhat also reminds me of Vertigo because that's another story about a man and a woman that fall in love with each other and the woman is MARRIED! Or is she? The film is a bit more mysterious and suspenseful than I was envisioning it. I was envisioning just a dramatic love story but putting mystery and suspense in there makes the film even more enjoyable. May I add it was very well-acted too? This film also was fun to watch because of the quirky camera and the good music. This obviously wasn't as violent and involved as Wolfgang Petersen's surprising mystery thriller Shattered which was another dramatic love story which was actually pretty good. It had a pretty similar story to this film when it comes to the drama and the mystery even though this one is definitely tamer and didn't involve a murder of someone. Brief Encounter is obviously better than Shattered yet not as suspenseful. Yet Shattered will never be a classic and probably never was. It was just one of those pretty good violent/romance flicks that keep you watching. So this film is very enjoyable from beginning to end and waaaayyyy better than I expected which I didn't expect much from it even though I saw it got four stars in the TribTV TV guide. So I decided to flip to TCM to watch it and see if it was any good and it was great! Although it may have been great, the ending of the film was a bit over-dramatic. Laura was asked if she was okay by her REAL husband after she was done daydreaming and instead of replying with words, she started crying and that was it. Then you slowly see The End pop up on the screen and then the movie slowly fades away to black. Movie directed by David Lean.",

The interesting part is the conclusion, which could turn out in a myriad of ways. This premise reminds me of Lean's later epic, Dr. Zhivago (although the woman and men roles are reversed in it), but is much more centralized.The film's cast is very small, mainly focused on three characters. Laura Jesson is the woman in question, who is a completely typical person. The whole film is narrated by her and witnesses from her viewpoint. My favorite character is her husband, Fred Jesson. He is a trusting and laid back man, who is usually seen working on crossword puzzles. Laura realizes that she is not getting the satisfaction she wants from the marriage after meeting Dr. Alec Harvey at a train stop. He is a woman's man: caring, handsome, intelligent, and personal. Throughout the film, we get to see Laura frequently visit Dr. Harvey, which puts her loyalty to Fred into question.The film started off slowly, but became much more interesting after the first twenty minutes or so. It is very dialog and narration heavy, which is hard to understand at first but gets clearer along the way. To add some flavor, classical music is often used to accompany the scenes.I was unsure if I would like Brief Encounter before watching it (and even as I started watching it), but I ended up liking it very much. The story is rather simple, but is fluently put together and interesting. It also helps that the characters are easy to relate to.

            "content": "Most modern viewers won't like this film. They've been raised on films in which adultery is no issue whatsoever and you need exercise no control over your lust so they may be confused as to why Alec and Laura are making such a big deal out of it. That says more about modern society than it does about the quality of the film.The film is beautiful- the ultimate romantic movie. Laura (Celia Johnson), a 'happily married' middle-aged housewife, meets Dr Alec Harvey (Trevor Howard) by chance at a train station- he helps get a piece of grit out of her eye. Laura thinks nothing of it but as they bump into each other on their daily routines, it escalates into full-blown love. But can love conquer all? What I love about the film is that it makes no moral judgements on the characters- Laura and Alec are not portrayed as evil and Laura's husband isn't portrayed as an idiot. Laura and Alec are simply normal people who want something more from their lives. There's nothing wrong with Laura's marriage- it's perfectly 'normal'- but the possibility of true romance is too attractive to resist.The film manages to be romantic without ignoring the realities of life. Yes, the social restrictions of the forties mean that Laura and Alec's anguish may come across as melodramatic to a modern viewer but there is no reason why modern viewers shouldn't be able to identify. We all live relatively ordinary lives which are for the most part satisfactory- or at least, not unhappy. But there's a little part of everyone that wonders whether they could be happier if their life was different.",

It is very intense and the ending is heartbreaking, but the story will keep you enraptured from start to finish.Laura (Celia Johnson) is a housewife who travels by train once a week to shop in a nearby town. Alec (Trevor Howard) is a married physician who works in a local clinic on the same day of the week. They meet by chance when Laura has a cinder in her eye, which Alec helps remove. Their romance starts innocently enough, but quickly blossoms into a passionate love affair. Alec sees that the relationship will only cause heartache, so he takes a job in South Africa. The story of the couple's last day together is sadly romantic and very moving, culminating in a poignant final sequence at a train station where they met.\"Brief Encounter\" is beautifully filmed in B&W. Johnson and Howard are both excellent, portraying two people in a relationship that cannot continue. The film is a perfect departure from most today's movies, as it deals maturely with adult themes and has no filthy language, no toilet humor, and no violence.I've watched \"Brief Encounter\" numerous times and it actually seems to improve with each viewing. I think you'll like it unless you hate B&W film or you prefer today's mostly sophomoric movies.",

The ongoing narrative of Celia Johnson has you caring about her from the very beginning and the 'main stage' of 'Melford Station' is a wondrous post war setting which really draws you into the period of the film. Trevor Howard as the male lead gives a straight forward rendition of a man torn between two women but few actors could replace him in this role. Celia Johnson is magnificently cast as the routine housewife whose life suddenly changes with that one Brief Encounter. I recommend anyone to see this film as it is truly wonderful.

            "content": "SYNOPSIS: A married woman falls in love with a doctor. NOTES: Nominated for the following prestigious Hollywood awards: Best Actress, Celia Johnson (lost to Olivia de Havilland in To Each His Own), Best Screenplay (Adapted) (lost to The Best Years of Our Lives), Best Directing (won by William Wyler for The Best Years of Our Lives). Celia Johnson in Brief Encounter, Best Feminine Performance of 1946. \u2013 New York Film Critics Award. Brief Encounter, number four on the National Board of Review's Ten Best of 1946. Third to The Wicked Lady and Piccadilly Incident as the U.K.'s top box office attraction for 1946. COMMENT: Frankly, Trevor Howard and Celia Johnson are not my idea of romantic lovers. But then of course that is what Brief Encounter is all about. They are not supposed to be. That is why the film was so popular. Not only did it break with tradition but it presented a pair of lovers devoid of Hollywood glamour. Average people with whom many cinema-goers could identify. This of course is what is wrong with the remake with Richard Burton and Sophia Loren. Which is why said remake was not popular. But for my money \"Brief Encounter\" is just a bit too homely on the one hand, too upper-class on the other, too defiant of convention yet too conventional (which can be seen in the ending and the fact that the affair is not an affair, legally at any rate). I also find the low- life scenes in the railway refreshment room (which is the scene of the original play incidentally) obtrusive. A pity. I like Stanley Holloway, but I don't think he belongs in this film. To my mind, Coward has got the ingredients for his dramatic formula not only wrong but has mixed them incorrectly. But I am a lone voice. Most everyone thinks Brief Encounter is wonderful. Certainly there can be no disputing the wonderful effectiveness of the music score (cleverly drawn from Rachmaninoff's Piano Concerto, which popularized this work and catapulted Rachmaninoff into the big league of popularly acclaimed composers), or the atmospheric brilliance and absolute attractiveness of Robert Krasker's superlative cinematography. Some deft examples of effective film editing too reveal Lean's former skill as film editor. My 2017 VIEW: This expansion of Coward's one-act play was hailed as one of the all-time great masterpieces of the English cinema when first released. A contemporary viewing is apt to disappoint. True, Johnson and Howard play with great charm and sincerity. Their dialogue is restrained and realistic, and there is a wistful, poignant mood (reinforced by the choice of Rachmaninoff's 2nd Piano Concerto for background music) in their scenes. Unfortunately, a great deal of this mood is dissipated by the low-life scenes of laboriously stilted comedy relief involving Stanley Holloway and Joyce Carey \u2014 which both play in an extremely stagey, heavy-handed manner. They seem even more theatrical because Lean has filmed their scenes in exactly the same manner as he uses for the tender, romantic scenes between Johnson and Howard, viz. large close-ups.",

            "content": "I understand what this movie tries to depict: ill-fated love. Two people meet by chance. They find passion. They must part (invitus invita, to take a Latin phrase from Suetonius). The movie almost succeeds. Almost. It leaves one aspect blank, one question unanswered. Why? Why does any of this happen? What is there in either of these characters to attract the other? The story provides no answer. She, Laura, is a bored housewife. The oomph has gone out of her marriage. I get it. Her husband is placid. He spends his evenings doing newspaper puzzles. Her kids annoy her; they are quarrelsome and, appropriately, immature. What she needs is a new man, a lover, someone exotic, someone full of excitement and, well, someone with oomph. In walks Alec Harvey. Is that what she sees in him? I sure don't. In fact, I don't see anything much at all in him. He's not terribly exotic. He's not terribly handsome. He's not terribly exciting. Now, if a darkly brooding Heathcliff or dashingly elegant Rhett Butler had walked into that railway restaurant ... that would be different. But he isn't Olivier and he isn't Gable. Animal magnetism, that isn't it. Maybe it's his mind, his scintillating conversation. He makes her think of faraway places and romantic adventures. Is that what sparkles irresistibly? Not that I can see. Altogether, he's a pretty dull dog, so far as their dialogue suggests, not much of an upgrade from the model she has at home. He talks about preventive medicine. She's mildly interested. They watch some B movies. Physically he's a reasonable but not an extraordinary specimen. (Can she really be so sex-starved?) Spiritually they don't seem to have much of anything in common. (They do share an enthusiasm for Donald Duck.) She reads novels. (He doesn't.) Otherwise, she's interested in - not much. I guess she likes Rachmaninoff. (Does he?)So, what accounts for their infatuation? What is there that makes their hearts beat as one? What attracts her to him, and not just as a casual fling, but so desperately - after only four platonic Thursdays together - so desperately that she wants to commit suicide Anna Karenina style when he walks away? I don't know. What attracts him to her? I don't know. Well, yes. It's Celia Johnson. She had an arresting beauty. Is that it? Is he a wolf on the prowl? He walks away not so desperate. He's the one, notice, who initiates the liaison. He aggressively pursues a carnal consummation, appropriating a friend's apartment to facilitate the assignation. He walks away after that assignation fails. It would be nice to know why Alec is dissatisfied with his life and wife. Laura asks him about his domestic situation. All we learn is that his unseen wife is named Madeline, that she's petite and dark haired. What has Madeline done wrong? Has she done anything wrong? What incites him to cast his roving eye on attractive women in railway stations? He keeps his backstory obscure.Two lonely people fall in love (let's give Alec the benefit of the doubt). We don't understand why their loneliness is so crushingly profound. How can we understand their love? I feel more deeply the yearning of Ernie Borgnine and Betsy Blair in \"Marty;\" they both are repressed, closeted people. Or Ronald Colman and Greer Garson in \"Random Harvest;\" memory-less, he is friendless; she feels for the lonely lost lamb. Or take another brief encounter, a truly heartbreaking brief encounter, Joan Fontaine and Louis Jourdan in \"Letter from and Unknown Woman.\" There we understand the emotions. We understand her passion and his callowness. Here characters are barely sketched out. Motivations are unfathomable. Without character and understanding, the depth, the chemistry just isn't there. And that is the whole movie. There is no more. Still, despite all this, \"Brief Encounter\" is a memorable film. It does stick with you. It did leave me with an emotional tug. Why? For that there is only one answer: Celia Johnson. She is luminous, the expressiveness of her eyes, the sublimity of her smile, mesmerizing as the image dissolves at the end and the camera moves in on her face lost in reverie. She must have been tremendous on the stage. It's a shame she wasn't filmed more often. \"Brief Encounter\" is worth watching, for her. Her performance makes you overlook the weakness of the story.

            "content": "This was one of the most irritating movies I have seen in a long time. There are so many reasons why.  But first let me state that I saw this in a film class and was not appreciative at all.  It was for a women's film studies week.  Second, I like some classics (including Gone With the Wind), but not this one.  Third, I like voice-over movies, if it is well done.Where to start?  First the plot.  Don't try to stop me if you have heard this one.  Married woman goes to town during day.  Woman meets stranger. They go to pictures.  They meet every week and fall in love.  She turns him away.  The End.  This is a very stereotypical chick flick.Second, the voice over.  My god, this was the worst voice-over I have ever heard.  It had more presence and was more meticulous to detail than the voice-over in Stanley Kubrick's \"The Killing.\"  Any movie where the voice-over states in quick, matter-of-fact monotones \"I was rather hot.  So I sat down.\"  as we get a picture of the speaker sitting down at a bench is bad in my book.  Plus it is serious about it.  For the most part it is like reading a book, only with no personality.  Quick, no change in tone, except when imagining she is addressing her husband, and with a grate-your-nerves high-fallooting British (maybe I am wrong, but foreign) accent.  I wanted to yank her voicebox out by the end of the first twenty minutes.Third, overly melodramatic.  I mean this was a turn-on-the-waterworks, bring-out-your-hankies type of story.  And it belittled me by not letting me feel this for myself, but my trying to forcefeed me my emotions.  I can have my own feelings thank you.  Either way, skip this movie.  It is one of the worst of the bunch.  If you want a good voice-over movie see \"Election\" (four voice-overs) or \"The Opposite of Sex\" (the voice over loses itself) or \"The Killing\" (it knows that it is almost mocking).  1/10",

            "review_title": "A Breath of Fresh Air",
            "content": "What a breath of fresh air this film is!!I watched this film as part of a David Lean double-header with \"The Bridge on the River Kwai\".  You'd think you could hardly find two less similar films, but I was surprised exactly how much they had in common.  I saw each of them as a kind lovesong to a mythologized past.  \"Kwai\" romanticizes the war, the soldiers, the prison, the bridge, whereas the reality was far more brutal.  \"Brief Encounter\" romanticizes pre-war Britain.The performances in the film are case studies in understatement.  Celia Johnson and Trevor Howard do little to overtly establish the emotional turmoil their characters are experiencing, yet the message comes across very well indeed.  Compare to \"Casablanca\", for instance.  With no disrespect to that magnificent film, \"Brief Encounter\" manages to convey the same level of emotional intensity without resorting to the sort of grand dramatic scenes that Hollywood specialized in at this time.\"Brief Encounter\" is a thoroughly English film.  I love all things English, so I have complaint about that.  But it is unusual to American audiences, which makes it a barrier especially to modern viewers.  Some people call the film dated, and this is partly what they mean.  I don't think it is dated at all, not really.  The attitude of the characters toward their relationship is unusual.  It's been very much en vogue for a long time now to treat adultery very casually in films.  This film treats it very seriously.  But there's nothing dated about that.  It's not as though adultery used to be a moral issue and isn't now.  It's that we're unaccustomed to seeing a film portray it so sensitively.I've noticed a lot of people really digging into this film and throwing up all sorts of interesting conjectures.  From the sexual orientation of Alec's friend to Alec's real agenda in all this, it's fascinating to speculate about what else might be going on.  But I think it's important to remember that this story is told from Laura's point of view.  This is deliberate, and it's important.  The film is not so much about Alec and Laura as it is about Laura.  If Alec is a womanizer, a psychotic, or a con man, it makes no difference to the film, because Laura believes him, and she believes that he loves her.  This film is about how she responds to this sudden and unexpected tumult in her life.I've heard others refer to Laura's husband as the villain of the piece.  In a sense, I suppose he is.  In a sense, he stands in conflict to the heroine's desire.  But not really.  The really troubling thing about Laura's \"affair\" (be it consumated or not... it doesn't matter in the least) is how utterly irrelevant her husband is.  Her pangs of guilt seem to have less to do with her family than they do with simply obeying a pre-existing moral code.  Adultery isn't wrong because of the pain it inflicts loved ones, it's wrong because society says it is.  Laura is intellectually aware that thoughts of her family should make her feel guilty, and sometimes they do, but other times they don't.  Her family is, in the grand scheme of things, only a very minor complication.  The main complication, the real barrier to Laura's happiness, is society's mores.  That's the villain.But even that is too simple.  That's the beauty of this picture.  The idea isn't that society's rules are wrong, or repressive.  It's that society's rules are simple, while life can get very complicated.  It's about the conflict between those simple rules and this simple love, and the complicated web of guilt, self-loathing, confusion, and despair they create. What's the answer?  Free love?  Open marriages?  No, that would create other problems, obviously.But then, this film isn't about finding answers.One last comment:  for such a great director, I noticed that the directing was nothing very special in this film.  I mean, the cinematography was gorgeous, but it was shot in a very simple, straightforward, unimpressively effective manner.  Until the end, when Laura runs out on to the platform, after Alec leaves.  That sequences... the angled shot of her face, the sense of claustrophobia, despair, and blind panic.  It's an incredible moment.",

Celia Johnson and Trevor Howard are perfectly cast as the strangers who fall in love after a chance meeting in a station tearoom.

The look on her face and the way she says \"Oh Alec\" strikes a very specific nerve for me. Then the dialog when she's leaning out of the train window, and the train pulls away ever-so-slowly . . . probably the best heartbreakingly romantic scene ever.

Johnson is particularly impressive in the way she tactfully skirts the overwrought potential of her character with a performance that is nuanced as it is endearing. The stellar leads are also supported by several interesting characters, especially Myrtle the sassy cafe manager and Albert the cheeky station conductor.Perhaps the only criticism of Coward's pithy script is that it doesn't sufficiently develop Laura's relationship with Fred, her seemingly mild-mannered and understanding husband.

Alec is trying to explain his work to Laura and she admits to not understanding - never the less he continues. As Trevor Howard makes each medical term he uses sound erotically charged Celia Johnson almost faints into her Banbury as she succumbs to his metaphorical ardour. It is one of the sexiest scenes in cinema with the actors keeping their clothes on - a hard act to try and follow today.

Secondly, the dialogue is among the most banal I have ever heard. This has little to do with the time it was made. Didn't they have subtlety in 1945? Implied meaning? Good God woman, you don't have to tell us you sat down, we can see it on the screen. I think the direction is actually very good: excellent use of limited settings, some good lighting and camera angles. But the dialogue. Oh God. \"I love you, with all my heart and soul\", the good doctor says. \"I wish I was dead\", Laura sensitively replies. I was in audience with my Film colleagues and we just cracked up. Is this kind of dialogue \"quaint\" or \"British\" or \"typical of the era it came from\" or just plain bad? I'll go with the latter. I don't think there's much problem with the plot really, and I like the way it was told. But Celia Johnson was neither attractive (not her fault) or interesting (her fault) in anyway. She always had a self-pitying look on her face, and this was reflected in her dialogue. As someone else said, she didn't seem to care so much for her family, but more about personal risk in having an affair. Her decision is made for her in the end, which left me feeling that she was lumbered with a family that deserved her more than she deserved them. You know she would of carried on seeing the bloke if she could. So, to summarise, poor acting and poor dialogue. They're usually quite important to a film. David Lean's direction was fine, but I really couldn't give a toss about such silly, selfish and dull characters. The thought that this is considered one of the all-time great tearjerkers is enough to draw one from me, that it's considered one of the best British films ever made is downright depressing.",

Its a simple story about two innocent characters who fall in love, but feel shameful about having an affair. Its narrated from the woman's point of view, the story is melodramatic and bittersweet. I respect that it was filmed during the war though.I'm not saying its a bad film, I'm just saying its a chick flick, which is a genre I'm not a fan of.I'd recommend it to people who liked \"The Notebook\", \"In The Mood for Love\", or \"Closer\".",

            "content": "Brief Encounter remains a classic simply because of the timeless integrity of its subject matter.Celia Johnson plays Laura, a morally upright woman contemplating an extra-marital affair with a charming doctor called Alec (Trevor Howard). What is remarkable is that you feel sympathy for Laura even though she is falling into the realms of adultery. The acting is so impressive simply because they are playing characters you are likely to meet in real life. Also, the reason why this romance works so much more than most commercialised Hollywood romances, is because the leads are not particularly attractive. They are normal, every day people, who meet by chance. It is something which could happen to anyone.The direction from Lean is educated and mature. He does not overplay any scenes, he simply lets to tension build within a likely situation like it would do in real life. There is no supernatural or extra-ordinary element to this film. It is effective because of its relation to reality.I recommend this British classic to anyone and everyone.",

The casting of Johnson and Howard was a masterpiece in itself, never mind the brilliant direction and of course writing. Pace is something many films get wrong; in this one it's as exquisite as the cinematography.For me, Brief Encounter is about being trapped, imprisoned, inside a warm, comfortable and safe place that you only saw for what it is because you looked outside one day and found something new, unfamiliar, powerful and overwhelmingly beautiful.Having seen the film many times, I am moved to tears most by the tea room sequence at the beginning, because of course the significance of the tragedy unfolding is all too familiar already. Her husband welcoming her back at the end is merely the icing on a jewel of a terribly British (nay English) cake.If your heart beats, and your blood runs hot through your veins, and you still have life left in your soul and a soul in your life, treasure this movie.",

            "content": "This movie directed in 1945 by David Lean tells the story of a woman called Laura Jesson (starring Celia Johnson) who is apparently happily married to a man \u2013 Fred Jesson \u2013 and has with him a son and a daughter. The Jesson family lives in a small village near a larger town called Milford. As a housewife she goes off to this town every Thursday in order to buy some house staff and also goes to the cinema and has lunch at a restaurant. By hazard, one of the days when she is waiting for the train back to the village where she lives she encounters a doctor called Alec Harvey who helps her get a speck of dust from within her eye. Since then they will be tangled into crazy love story which could be characterized as gradual but really quick. The movie starts in media res since we are presented at the couple of new lovers in the bar of the railway station. After that, it is told that the man is leaving to Africa and then there is a very sad, short and emotionless though deep farewell. The uses of the camera are really helpful in order to watch the development of the story. Besides, the spectator is the one who knows almost everything within the plot since even Laura's feelings, emotions and thoughts are told using a very important tool in cinema, I mean the voice-over. Furthermore, we are told every step of the love relationship and the family daily life, the lies Laura ends up telling to her husband. The whole story is told because the woman sits on the sofa after one of her weekly journeys from Milford and is willing to tell her husband everything that has happened to her from the moment when she meets Doctor Alec for the first time. We are conducted to the images by means of some ambiance music Laura herself turns on at her sitting room. This same music returns the woman to reality and puts us back to the story of the two lovers and back to reality again. This very music also marks the end of the movie and is a very important element in the film. The characters in the story do not evolve a lot except for both lovers; Laura and Alec are turned into very introspective characters who are even able to lie to the people they love the most and willing to hide from everybody else. Nevertheless, Laura seems more conscious of the dangers of such love story while Doctor Alec is less prudent. On the other hand, Laura's husband \u2013 Fred \u2013 is a flat character who shows a tremendous love and a great and admirable respect for his wife and his children. The spectator may find that this one of the best love-sad stories ever told or seen on a film since, from my point of view, it gather of the elements for it those mainly being a married woman in what turns to be a happy but dull and monotonous marriage who finds a man who silently comes to be very important in her life, even crucial and a sad ending with what I interpreted as a suicide attempt. In the story the feelings of the spectator move from fear, to joy and to sadness at it happens with Laura's own character and we become a silent witness of the whole story since we know that the woman is cheating on her husband but we cannot tell anybody. I highly recommend that you watch this movie since it is very interesting to know the inner feelings of the main character and it is something that could happen to anyone in real life. Besides, the mechanisms are very well used and it seems a very real story.",

            "content": "Director David Lean earned the first Academy recognition for his career when he received a Best Director Oscar nomination, and a Screenplay Writing nomination he shared with Anthony Havelock-Allan and Ronald Neame, for this essential romance drama starring Celia Johnson and Trevor Howard. Johnson received her only Oscar recognition, a Best Actress nomination, for her role as a British housewife in an unexciting marriage such that a \"brief encounter\" leads to an affair (or does it?). Noel Coward wrote a play called \"Still Life\", which was the uncredited idea for the film's story.While sitting in her living room with her dependable, yet dull husband Fred (Cyril Raymond) and fumbling with her cross-stitch, Laura Jesson (Johnson) thinks about her relationship with Dr. Alec Harvey (Howard), a man with whom she'd had a chance meeting at a railway station when she'd gone into town. She remembers a great deal of detail, including the characters in the station's coffee shop like the station master Albert Godby (Stanley Holloway), who flirts incessantly with Myrtle (Joyce Carey), the hostess-waitress behind the counter. As if by fate, they meet again and Laura's relationship with Alec, who's also married, grows to the point that they plan to consummate it with a physical encounter at one of his friend's apartment.The film's story is really about what constitutes an affair and at what point is a wife being unfaithful to her husband. Laura contemplates all of this including whether or not to go through with the clandestine meeting. Naturally, there are some bumps and/or other circumstances along the way which make both parties think through their plans and their decisions, making sure that it's a conscience act versus one that just falls together easily.An intricately written and directed drama, against the backdrop of trying, fateful times (World War II) which deserves its high rating.",

A classic moment comes when Laura (Celia Johnson) contemplates suicide, Lean uses the sudden appearence of a train and scream of its whistle to convey her desperation. For me \"Brief Encounter\" is so great because it has such a downbeat feel to it. It is, in short, one of the truely honest films about love ever made.",

            "content": "Brief Encounter is a film from the director David Lean released in 1945. The production is starred by Cecilia Johnson ( Laura) and Trevor Howard (Alec) and it is an adaptation of a play written by No\u00ebl Coward (Still Life) The film itself has also been adapted later for theatre plays, opera and radio programmes, receiving always positive critics. The movie is set in a train station from Lancashire and some of the kernel events in the story are developed in that particular place. The soundtrack is repeated in almost the whole film and it is the Piano Concerto No. 2, composed by Sergei Rachmaninoff. The film tells the story of Laura Jesson and Alec Harvey, both married , who accidentally meet in a train station and quickly fall in love. The film presents then, their love story in a dramatic way, because, as mentioned before, both are married. Love, cheating and moral values are some of the main themes that this production explores and, in my opinion, it is the duty of the spectator to condemn or support the couple, to judge whether they are acting wrong or just following the instincts of two people in love. However, the film also presents some mysteries that the spectators must find out by their own. There are also some technical aspects which are important to mention in this story. First of all, it is essential to highlight the \"role\" of the voice over, which is as important as any of the characters. Thanks to this voice, the spectator knows what is happening during the whole story and it makes impossible then, to miss the main events in the film. Secondly, the story ends in the same moment that it starts but, almost the rest of the film is a flashback from Laura's mind, which permits also to see what the voice over tells. There is also a fictitious flashforward, again from Laura's perspective, when she imagines how would be her future life with Alec. Finally, there are also some fadings (not complete) which make way to other subsequent scenes ( in time). Places are also important: the train station plays a crucial role in this story and there are specific spaces within the station which are recurrent as the cafeteria, the tunnel for going from one platform to the other... The clocks in the station are also repeated motifs as they are the indicators and limits of the couple: they indicate they time left. In my opinion, the film is good in the sense that leaves the spectator thinking for possible solutions to those mysteries previously mentioned. However, I did not enjoy very much Laura's character, as she transmit a continuous feeling of anxiety and also that it is not very clear the director's point of view or the message he wants to express. In spite of these minute details, I liked the film, and I think that the plot is also innovative and original and got to attract me and that is something I appreciate while watching a film.

Coward's original brief encounter was homosexual, in Preston, Northern England whilst waiting for a connection in his theatrical days. It was indeed brief, but here transformed into something heterosexual, and unbriefly memorable. The reality of such an encounter between 1946 middle-class Britons would have been as unlikely as the movie's contradictory Southern English accents. But then, movies are not necessarily about the truth. They're about the truth in untruths; the 'ah- but if's? They stand or fall by their ability to storm and overwhelm critical scruples. Few movies we merely tolerate as just okay, or mildly annoying. Mostly we love them or hate them. It may be the ambience of middle-class correctness in austere 1940's Britain which makes this movie believable, but it's the profound aspirations to decency and loyalty it inspires which makes it great.",

            "content": "Along with \"The Fallen Idol\" and \"It Always Rains on Sundays\" this film represents the best of British cinema. (By the way, I wrote \"movie\" and then replaced it with the word \"film\" in the previous sentence because in several ways the excellence here has much more to do with the art of filmmaking than usually seen in commercial cinema.) Don't get me wrong, this thoroughly engrossing, intense film is enjoyable and even entertaining too: if you like some depth in your entertainments.Two points for me make this film soar over usual fare and linger in our minds long after watching it: 1) interiority of character and 2) single-minded focus in the narrative, devoid of diversions or sub-plots.Re: interiority, here the entire story is reflected and refracted via the character of Laura: reinforced by countless filmmaking choices, from extended voice-overs to long reaction shots, we get the kind of insights into one character's mind more typical of literature than the medium of film. From the opening scene in a suburban train station cafe, where we see the camera focus on the expressive face of Celia Johnson's Laura, the film frequently succeeds in unearthing the submerged layers of society life--in one instance using the device of Laura's face reflected in the train window glass to delve deeper into her psyche.Re: the singular narrative focus derives as much from the format of the original material as an actual choice per se: in other words, the fact that this was based on Noel Coward's one-act play works further in its favor than we realize at first. By its very definition, a one-act play cannot really have multiple climaxes and sub-plots. And thankfully so: because unlike some British fare from the era featuring nearly impenetrable British local slang and accents, here we have the kind of clarity we expect from watching an English-language film. No subtitles needed. (The lack of too many digressing sub-plots means that the chances of us viewers getting lost following the voices of sundry London or city folk is minimized too.)",

The love-play was cringingly stiff-upper-lippedly wooden, and any sexual undertones there were in this pathetic, laughable encounter, would have perhaps been better served in one of his proper effervescent comedies.Noel Coward, as probably everyone knows, was worthily called \"The Master\" for his quick-fire scathing wit. So I think he must have been surprised, as was probably everyone else involved, by the lasting success of this dourly adapted tear-jerker.I must agree that it was slightly better (thanks largely to David Lean's direction) than other similarly dreadful British movies prevalent at the time, but it's still one for my trash can, if not yours, and I'll leave the reverence for \"Brief Encounter\" to those who enjoy a good weep.

Her true thoughts and feelings punctuate the external action as we hear a subversive and confidential commentary to which other characters are not privy.Mrs Jesson falls for a doctor (Trevor Howard) whom she meets by chance at the railway station during an afternoon shopping trip. Showing his professional credentials early on, by removing a piece of grit from her eye, he appears to be as much a gentleman of leisure as she is on weekday afternoons. They embark upon a fairly harmless romance that centres around visits to the cinema and the tea shop.No ordinary Tea-Shoppe this, though, boasting three quarters of a string quartet (exceptional performance by Irene Handl as an arthritic, provincial cellist) and fancying itself to be an outlying satellite of The Palm Court at The Ritz.With great supporting performances from the staff at the Station Buffet (particularly Joyce Carey and Stanley Holloway), Laura's loquacious friend Dolly Messiter (Everley Gregg) and her faithful, but not-so-sharp, husband Fred (Cyril Raymond) we are soon transported to a bygone era where we are quickly drawn into every aspect of their unusual preoccupations and neuroses.This film really captures the mood of the time and the underlying confusion and torment that besets these pretentious, stilted and unfulfilled individuals.",

Romance is developing too fast. The story almost \"live\" from Thursday to Thursday. The lady's husband was full of understanding and mild obtuse. I think it would be interesting to know the doctor's family.Celia Johnson as Laura Jesson leaves a great impression as emotionally troubled woman. Some cynics would say that it seems a little impersonal. I think that the effect corresponding to the conditions and the grayness of postwar life. Her expressions of love and sad look at the end saying enough. Trevor Howard as Dr Alec Harvey is paired with Laura was very good. Character is somewhat contradictory. Maybe even pathetic. I try not to overdo it. He simply does not transmit strong emotions.I would not use the term \"affair married people.\" About morality or validity of ordinary people is too say.

Based on a story written by a genius (Noel Coward), screenplay written and directed by another genius (David Lean).  If ever we were predisposed to like a film, it would be this one.  And so we have.  If not for the relatively small number of votes this has received, this film would be about #20 in the top 250. Can that be?However, I approached my first viewing of this film with a critical eye, and here's what I saw: 1) Boring.  After the first thirty minutes it was clear that the remainder would be more of the same (and so it was).  I had to force myself to stay to the unquestionably predictable end.  I just didn't care about these people and their childish infatuation with each other. 2) Unconvincing.  People don't fall in love like that.  Ever.  These people had absolutely no reason to be in love with each other (and no, that ISN'T what makes this a great story).  This kind of character and plot development is fine for cartoons; doesn't cut it for adult dramas, even melodramas.  The female character did nothing but fret about the wrongfulness of her actions. It got to be quite annoying to this viewer.",

It might be all right as a stage play, but frankly as a film it is an utter disaster. Unlike that other pseudo-classic Citizen Kane, this film will not let you sleep: it winds you up as the two protagonists display the broken hearts they are wearing on their raincoat sleeves. Is Celia Johnson going to run off with the cardboard doctor, or is she going to stay at home with her Times crossword-filling husband, lie back and think of the Home Counties idyllic post-war England that this film portrays?

Among all the love stories on extra marritial affairs i have seen till date, Brief Encounter tops the list by margin. Possibly the only film which shows an extra marritial Affair but doesn't harm the basic morals and commitments of the marriage. The film runs on just 2 characters of Celia Johnson and Trevor Howard and they make the entire narrative look real, gripping, engaging with thier Charming chemistry. I must admit director David Lean is a Genius, the way he showcased this unusual film with tight narrative of around 86 minutes is just mind-blowing. His ideas of telling the story are brilliant, whether it is narrating the story from the lead actress's point of view or the trick of repeating the climax scene at the beginning and still making it feel all the way different is just unbelievable. There will be films made on an affair, true love and sacrifice but none will match the timeless impact of Brief Encounter. Recently, i remember watching bollywood flick #TheLunchbox (2013) which also includes an unusual lovestory and i loved it so much but Brief Encounter came almost 70 years before that, just imagine how powerful it is.

For how it portrays love, and its impossibilities, it belongs with Casablanca, and what came before. The world, and the British, were reinventing themselves, after the war, and this world, of having to choose between passion or conventions was soon to be dead. But the play is from 1937, and was kept pretty much unchanged in what it depicted. So this film is as much in between worlds, in between conceptions of love, of cinema, of social conventions, as Rachmaninoff is a modern mind living in a Romantic world.To me this is a tragedy wearing a romance's clothing, but as a film, this one is dated. don't misunderstand me, that's not necessarily a bad thing. Simply new codes were invented, new (or simply different) demands were infused in the audiences. To our modern ability to see, the film is overly staged, the acting is overly dated. But we do have a great female interpretation by Celia Johnson, and that sure is a strong point, because the film depends a great deal on us buying our way into the world as seen by Laura. And we do, at least i did.But Lean is, or was to become at this point, a great director. I wouldn't see him going so far as he did if i'd seen this movie when it was new. He relies on the heritage from older days, from expressionism, and from more recent ones, from Toland/Welles and their than recent experimentation with composition and lighting. This cinematographer would shoot The Third Man, and that's tells us something. Still, and still considering Rachmaninoff, and Lean, i think these two mirror each other in how their work, at its best, builds images, extremely over the top, but incredibly pure and powerful. Landscapes. What Lean would give us, his Arabia, his grand vision that opposes desert to intimacy is not even hinted. Not here, where he still lives in a world of intimacies, of repressed feelings, of unachieved visions, like the visions of Paris and Venice that Laura imagines without ever getting them. Here, in this film, it's Coward's vision that overcomes every other vision, that's what we're kept with: the critic to hypocrisy, the contrast with the natural and pure flirtation of the \"lower\" class, the veiled hint of homosexuals in the character of Stephen.What will stay with me is the smoke and smell, and the refreshment room. This is a film about trains, passing each other, crossing, never ending, random lives submitted to useless moral and an outdated world, that exists no more. mismatching. memories.My opinion: 3/5http://www.7eyes.wordpress.com",

As a general rule, I only love romances if I have a crush on the actress; Celia Johnson is very pretty but she's not Audrey Hepburn in \"Breakfast at Tiffany's.\" And this sort of peaon to bourgeoisie love made impossible by society is exactly what I find myself unable to finish in novel form. Yet it works so well, and I'm totally swept away by this movie. Its pinnacle for me is a brief sequence, where Johnson's character narrates her hopes of traveling to far-off lands with her new lover and we see dreamlike images of the two in Paris, Venice, the tropics...just hazy enough that our imagination carries us away. And ultimately the story is about dreams and yearning, not any specific middle-class love affair/society tale. I can only credit this universal dreamer's appeal to David Lean; I'm unfamiliar with Noel Coward's other work and while the story and dialogue are excellent it's really the direction that carries the viewer off, in my opinion. David Lean is at the top of my list of favorite directors, primarily on the basis of \"Lawrence of Arabia\" (which also hovers at the top of my list of favorite movies). He is able to use imagery and mood to tap into our deepest dreams and desires so that his stories take on a mythical quality all beyond preportion to their subject. Clearly the protagonist wants to escape her life in dreary England but a key to the film is that this England is romantically dreary, not dull but melancholy. That's all I can say, it's very hard to convey this film's appeal. Just see it and you will understand.",

            "content": "BRIEF ENCOUNTER is Lean's last \"small\" picture, as well as being the last of his collaborations with the great Noel Coward, as Lean was determined to be known for something more than just being the best interpreter of Coward's work on the screen.  The film is based on Coward's STILL LIFE, a one-act play about a middle-aged man and women -- both married with children, he a physician and she a suburban housewife -- who start an illicit affair that is doomed from the beginning.  Though Lean expands the story in his adaptation, not a shot of film is wasted on the nonessential and not a single essential aspect of the original work is lost in the translation.The tragic lovers first meet inside a small deli at a train station located in Milford, England just before the start of W.W.II.  Laura Jesson, the housewife (poignantly played by Celia Johnson), travels to Milford from her home by train every Thursday where she spends the day shopping, having lunch with friends, taking in movies, etc.  Dr. Alec Harvey (played by Trevor Howard), a general practitioner, meets up with her sometime after he agrees to assist his friend Stephen (played by Valentine Dyall) at Stephen's practice in Milford.  Alec travels to and from his home by train, which frees Stephen to service his other patients at a second practice in London a few days each week during which time Alec resides at Stephen's flat.  Alec departs on a train that leaves just before Laura's in the early evening . .. every Thursday.Their first meeting occurs when Laura gets a bit of coal dust in her eye from the stack of a passing train just outside the deli.  She hurries inside for help from the matron who runs the deli (Myrtle, played by Joyce Carey). Naturally, the good doctor, who is sitting at a nearby table awaiting his train, comes to her aid.  This brief encounter sets up the logic for the more friendly and personal chance encounter that occurs the following Thursday in a small restaurant in Milford, which marks the beginning of the end of the affair, one that is never consummated by anything more than three kisses.  Indeed, while they fall deeply in love and remain so to the end and beyond, they will meet only three more times, on Thursdays of course, in Milford.  And these are the only times they will see or talk with one another throughout the film before their affair of three weeks ends. \nThis is not so much a film about a doomed romance as much as it's a film about two people who come to fully appreciate the extent of the wretched emptiness and loneliness in their own hearts when they discover in each other the kind of companionship that is possible between kindred spirits. Though they share moments of the most exquisite joy, they are nonetheless constantly tormented by the guilt and the shame that comes with the little lies and evasions they play out to conceal their love from others, primarily from Laura's husband, Fred, a kind but self-absorbed man (played by Cyril Raymond), and her friends in Milford.  These are two very decent people, and they are also tormented for the sake of their respective spouses and children.  It is these dark feelings that doom the relationship, as they both agree that the pain of deceit is greater than the delight of their love and would utterly destroy them and the lives around them.  Before they become more deeply involved, they decide that Alec must take the position in Johannesburg, South Africa that has been offered him and go their separate ways forever.Nothing is directly revealed about Alec's relationship with his wife and children.  Indeed, they are never seen and are only mentioned twice in the film . . . just so we know that he has a family in another town.  However, Alec's loneliness is evident from the beginning, and we see him come to life in Laura's company; the passion he has for his vocation as he reveals himself to her.  We also see that Johnson's character is somewhat frivolous, but this aspect of her makeup is by design, a contrivance behind which she hides herself.  Inside is a sensible and caring person, an adult, who comes out from behind her hiding place to meet with Alec and is about to endure the greatest heartache of her life.  And herein lies the key as to why the film works so well, for Laura narrates the story.  We are let into her psyche, and watch and listen as she undergoes a process of self-realization and discovery.  It's a painful journey accented by the comings and the goings of the trains.  Further, the story is told in flashback, an unspoken confessional to her husband in voiceover as they sit together at their home in the evening -- he reading, she knitting -- shortly after she has returned from Milford where she and Alec have just ended the affair. \nIn addition to the visual and voiceover narratives, the notes of Rochmaninoff's Piano Concerto No. 2 rise and fall just under and over the narratives as the mood demands.  It plays briefly during the opening credits along with the attention-grabbing opening sequence and then is reintroduced to accompany the voiceover narrative just under the characters' dialogue. It swells up to support the drama's emotional tension at key moments or to rush the rails along with the passing trains.  The music is ingeniously attached to the narrative, as it naturally flows in the background from the radio in Laura's and Fred's parlor!  To reinforce this, Lean briefly breaks into the narrative at the mid-way point, and we are jerked back into the parlor, into the now, when Fred interrupts Laura's thoughts to reduce the volume on the radio.  Naturally, the break in the narrative occurs at just the right moment . . . before it continues on again.Also, the film's larger story begins and ends with the scene of the couple's final breakup, which is interrupted by Dolly (played by Everley Gregg), a boorish twit and one of Laura's acquaintances who also travels to and from Milford by train.  The interruption of the couple's final goodbye is balanced against the earlier interruption that occurs at the flat in Milford when the couple is in danger (?) of consummating the relationship just as Stephen arrives home early one night.  Laura flees from the flat out the back door.  If the film's narrative breaks down at all, it's at this point, for we are privy to the conversation that ensues between Alec and Stephen .. . after Laura's departure.  Stephen discovers the decidedly feminine scarf that Laura inadvertently leaves behind and voices his disappointment in Alec rather harshly.  Stephen of course has no idea who the fleeing woman is; he just knows it's not Alec's wife!  I believe this violation of the point of view works, as it is brief, there is appropriately no voiceover and it is immediately followed by a sequence in which poor Laura is running through the pouring rain as if a hoard of demons were after her.  We are to understand that the conversation is both real and accurately imagined by Laura at the same time.  I suppose some critics would complain, but I think it's brilliant.  In any event, it strikes me as the height of absurdity to believe that Lean, who was one of the industry's leading film editors before he took the director's chair, simply failed to notice it.As it is indispensable, there is at least one other aspect to the film that must be acknowledged.  Through Laura's eyes, we watch the delightfully uninhibited exchanges between Albert (ticket inspector, played by Stanley Holloway) and Myrtle the matron, the working class lovers.  These sequences smartly support the narrative and serve to underscore Alec's and Laura's repressed desperation and the flatness of their lonely middleclass existences.This is Lean's most masterfully constructed film, and all of the performances, especially Johnson's, are solid gold.The only weakness, and it is so minor as to make this complaint almost petty, is the unnecessary voiceover touching on Laura's brief moment of madness when she rushes out of the deli with the notion of throwing herself in front of an oncoming train just after Alec leaves the station for the last time.  Aside from the action itself, the creative lighting (which briefly narrows around her, plunging everything else into darkness) and camera work (which tilts the frame and the world around her) that are employed here is all the narration needs.",

            "content": "\"As time goes by...\", the theme song of Casablanca is lingering in my mind when I recall the scenes of this magnificent classic movie, those were the days.  I don't remember I watched it on TV or in a small cine-art movie house.  Anyway, not until today do I realize that `Blithe Spirit' is also a work by David Lean, a movie woke my spirit up when I was watching it definitely a late night at home on TV some years ago.What makes a master a master?  Master is a veteran or a genius who is able to handle both blockbuster productions and decently budgeted works with panache, the films leave marks on people's memory, they make people remember them.  Needless to doubt, David Lean is one.  Master Lean is sacrosanct in the Brit film industry, who can forget the formidable A Passage to India, Doctor Zhivago, Hobson's Choice (the title has become an idiom in the English language, frighteningly powerful), Lawrence of Arabia, Ryan's Daughter, The Bridge on the River Kwai etc.Very likely Laura and Alec's romantic episode can take place in real life now so easily if a bored housewife commutes so routinely between two confined points meeting the same group of passengers and one day gets familiar with any one of them on any ordinary day.  Unlike today, at that conservative time, any \"unusual\" acts of married women, especially middle-class women, were the delicious ingredients, the juicy titbits of the neighbours' gossipy recipes.  The pain, the tension and the temptation come into sight when their seven weekly trysts at the refreshment room of the railway station are being scrutinized so closely by every eye around them in hot pursuit.Unattainable love is the most heartbreaking and the most unforgettable because it is a living fantasy.  Fortunately and unfortunately movies offer such fantasies.  When Laura and Alec's relationship starts, they are seeing a movie trailer \"Flames of Passion\".  It somehow foretells that this relationship can only exist in movies.  Lean has wonderfully and successfully captured the emotional nuances of Laura in form of narration. After Laura bade Alec farewell, viewers find her in the living room of her house with her husband, yet she is losing herself completely in her own imagination with two big blank eyes, envisioning the `happy journeys' with Alec in Paris, Venice.  She is overwhelmed with memories and in a sudden, her suppressed emotions, despair and remorse erupt and she burst into tears in Fred, her reality, her husband's arms.  That's the most impressive scene to me, she was flung out into realty from fantasy.Time has changed.  If Laura and Alec lived in our time, their story or chaste romance or clandestine affair or `adultery' would be like brushing teeth or going to toilet, nothing special.  Fate is merciful to their on-screen regret.  Their unfinished business is finally completed by another pair a couple of generations later.  The train takes departure from Carnforth Station, UK and passes through the invisible tunnel across the Atlantic to New York and New Jersey in the new world, the USA four decades later in the mid-80's, a more open era, a more opulent epoch.  Who are they? Molly and Frank (Meryl Streep and Robert De Niro) in `Falling in Love'. They run into each other when doing shopping for Christmas and meet again on the train between NY and NJ and the story goes on.  Again, it's the train, commuting time provides time for affair.  Well, they are luckier to have a happier ending but please no sequel.  Sequel may lead to break-up and make the entire `romance' a remorse.  Perhaps we have to give a standing ovation to Doris and George in `Same Time, Next Year' because they have more self-control and patience with their yearly affair so they can keep it for more than 1/4 century.I have not read the original script by Noel Coward or attended any play on stage so it's hard to tell if the movie out-performs the theatrical production or not.  I hope a local drama group will produce it one day.  As for the movie, it is able to stand the tests of time.",

It was as though, the director was running out of film, so they had to fit everything into a scene as quickly as possible. This is how people used to talk back then, or rather, how they used to act on screen.Trevor Howard is brilliant as the charming, conscientious, good-willed Doctor. The entire cast does a decent job of keeping the audience interested in the film, but I couldn't help thinking how attitudes have changed somewhat since the film's release, and I kept thinking what it would have been like to watch the film with someone from 1945 to gauge their reaction. Maybe they would have stormed out of the screening in disgust at the notion of married couples having affairs with other people.Brief Encounter is regarded as a classic, and who knows - maybe it was. But times change and so too do attitudes. This is a decent film, with often laughable dialogue, but it does not grip today's audience like it would have gripped the audiences of the forties. All it relies on now are its basic storyline contained within the social boundaries of its time, and half-decent acting, interrupted only by the fast-talking delivery of the cast.",

            "content": "Brief EncounterReview By Joe Donohoe'Brief Encounter' is a Noel Coward film made in 1945. 'Brief Encounter' is a Romance/Drama. David Lean directed the film while Noel Coward, Ronald Neame and Anthony Havelock-Allan helped produce it.'Brief Encounter' is a very simple story in which Celia Johnson plays a housewife named 'Laura Jesson', who always goes shopping in the local town on a Thursday. She buys groceries, goes to the cinema and stops by the local teashop to have refreshments. Whilst she is in the teashop she meets a local town doctor named Alec Harvey (played by Trevor Howard). Although they are already married, they gradually fall in love with each other. They continue to meet every Thursday in the same caf\u00e9. But they both know that their love is impossible.I thought 'Brief Encounter' was a film I wouldn't enjoy. Usually black and white romances aren't my sort of genre, but after I finished watching 'Brief Encounter' I realised that this film is truly marvellous.\nThe on-screen chemistry between Laura Jesson and Trevor Howard was superb not to mention the quality of the acting by the supporting cast. Celia Johnson acts superbly as 'Laura Jesson'. She was 100% convincing, and I'm surprised she didn't win any awards for her superb acting. Trevor Howard acts the role of Dr. Alec Harvey extremely well, totally convincing, great acting, and had a real presence on-screen. The direction by David Lean was great, you could see that he played a big part in making this film what it is. The lighting was also fantastic; another great aspect of this film.\nAll I can say about this film is positive; I really think this is one of the greatest love stories ever in film history. If only film directors and producers could make memorable films like 'Brief Encounter' now.\nThis film is a must-see, A true masterpiece.",

There's a very fine reason this film endures. Even though the film IS dated, it exists in such a way that it seems quite natural. It does always amaze me when I see criticism for ambitious art work from an early medium and hear it dismissed rather coldly, as some initial reviews for \"Brief Encounter\" have done here on IMDb. I've had friends give a miss to \"Citizen Kane\" because they found it drab. Naturally, the failed to understand that just about every film convention that they are so used to being exposed to 60 years on darn-near originated in that film!Similarly, in \"Brief Encounter\" the reflections of post war English society in the behavior of the characters are incredibly genuine. This in of itself is a departure from typical film-making of that era. Hell, it's still atypical to loads of Hollywood films. The glamour in this film is almost nonexistent except when it's deserved in the fantasy sequences, so I can wholly accept the players in this story as very true to life mid-20th century. The very fact alone that the characters have visible physical flaws illustrates the ordinariness of the situation in its place and time. I love it for that. I don't like voice over, but I respect the need for it in a film such as this.If you can't relate or accept the historic nuances of this engaging movie then I'd suggest you're probably unable to relate to art outside of your own prejudices, and I'd recommend giving this film a pass. However, if you're willing to view numerous contexts within this movie, then you'll be richly rewarded.",

My original intent here, after more than a half-century, and having seen the flick only once, was to observe, no doubt unnecessarily, that at least \"half\" the impact could be traced to Rachmaninoff, and the other to the Johnson/Howard twain, by way of the director. My lesser, er, ah, \"spoiler,\" observation was to deflate the Noel Coward writing credit. NC, for all his lifetime \"success\" and celebrity, was, to me, a pale and self-puffed shadow of the true English wit and snob, Oscar Wilde, whose mots and brilliance remain unsurpassed in the English language. To me, at any rate. Coward herein has supplied a one-note, and an overly sentimental one at that, insight. Rather like his one-note comic success in the wondrous personage of Margaret Rutherford madly bicycling her way through the countryside hedges in \"Blithe Spirit.\" The rest of that flick, like everything else I ever witnessed of the Coiward oeuvre, well, his WWII salute milked a twinge or two, could be summarized, to me at least, by that deathless line, \"Tennis, anyone?\" But this brief encounter is, for sure, one to remember.",

The story is simple enough and unfolds delightfully, but the dialogue in the opening scene is rapid. We're in a train waiting room. Tea is served and everyone is terribly friendly. Well aside maybe Myrtle at the counter who's putting Mr Godly in his place. I won't namecheck everyone, there's just too many worthy bit parts that make this tick. Laura (Celia Johnson) and Dr Alec Harvey (Trevor Howard) are who we're most concerned with. It's clear there's something between them, but Dolly, who gate crashes their table is clueless. She's a gossiping acquaintance rather than someone Laura can trust. Laura has a secret you see and could do with someone to trust. Her heart is broken. Broken because Alec is leaving for Africa with his wife and children and she's staying in England with her husband Fred and the children. Her children are a pain in the arse, I'd want to bugger off to Africa with the dishy Alec too! Fred though is a lovely man. He's just rather fond of The Times crossword and Laura wants more than sewing by the fire of an evening. She's happily married, tells herself this... but she's fallen in love, with Alec. One chance meeting, then two, three, fate playing its cruel games. Alec is quite charming. He's also full of life and it's possibilities. An afternoon spent together is all it takes as they get to know one another and become smitten. Maybe I'm a soppy sod, but it's lovely to watch. Even though they stand to hurt those they love and one another. Laura leads us through her daydream, talking to us as she paces the train platform, realising the danger. \"You know what's happened don't you. I've fallen I love with you\". You feel Laura and Alec's excitement. It's whirlwind stuff. All very prim and proper, but Laura whose eyes we see everything through is floating. That is until the lies get complicated and the guilt grows. Laura's numbness at the reality palpable. Based on a No\u00ebl Coward play, you'd expect it to be good and it really is marvellous. These characters are perfect and brought to life magnificently. Although Alec's friend Mr Lynn is a little slimy, but I guess that's his purpose. \"It's so easy to lie when you're trusted implicitly. So easy and so degrading\". It's easy to think of films of the era as old fashioned, but this feels as modern now as it would've 75 years ago. It's a melancholic masterpiece.",

This could be a storyline for a film written in modern times, although Brief Encounter is set in 1945, not sporting flashy lighting, effects or glamorous costly film locations, just a select few rather unromantic settings. But with all this combined it made for a nice change from the sexualised love affairs portrayed and consumed in present times.Celia Johnston plays Laura, a married middle class woman who leads a repressed yet comfortable life. A chance meeting as she is going about her weekly shopping trip leads her to fall in love with Dc. Alec Harvey, played by Trevor Howard; this sparks a secret love affair which runs over a 7 week period.Through Laura narrating the film she conveys a personal, yet biased viewpoint to the audience. Allowing us to sympathise and identify with her character, delving into the emotional depths of her mind of a love lost forever.The lack of sexual activities between the couple makes for a refreshing change, modern directors should certainly take a leaf out of this films book. David Lean has managed to convey love's meaning without the need for bedroom scenes, replacing this with other passions the characters possess, such as dining out or visiting the cinema.The simplicity of the plot conveys metaphorical meaning regarding the struggle that both women and men were going through during war time, having to conform to their given social classes whilst longing for freedom.Maintaining appearances, even in front of friends, played a major role in the lives of those living in the 1940's. Brief Encounter presents that idea in a sympathetic light, highlighting the pain caused from these given expectations.The audience are moved by Laura's farewell, where Alec bids her goodbye by touching her shoulder, this contact makes for a far more explosive and heart wrenching scene than many a passionate kiss in modern films can provide.Laura choosing to stay with her husband again allows audiences to identify with her character; she has chosen this path in favour of moral and family values, maintaining both the sanctity of marriage and her reputation reflected by her social class. The story is conveyed through a daydream, a reminiscent Laura returns to her predictable life once more having lived out a fantasy woman of the time could only dream of.",

And I think that compared to today, people were a lot stuffier, both in their speech and general demeanour.  This was the time when any lady of good reputation wouldn't be seen dead without her hat and gloves!",

Brief Encounter is, for many at least, the final word of cinema in the long unresolved issue of human love affairs. Calm and, at times, almost dispassionate, fragile and princely understating, this one is the triumph of the narrative cinema of emotions \u2013 but never emotionalism. You can blame it endlessly \u2013 for its high minded Britishness, for its dated nobility, for the pride of its characters before real love \u2013 but you would be missing the point. Brief Encounter is the product of its times and accusing it of reserve would be as if condemning a Jane Austen novel for not including pages of oral intercourse. And, in any case, how many times in your \"film life\" will you find yourself before such sincerity of expression of unselfish love AND feel strangely unfulfilled similarly to the characters portrayed?",

            "content": "I really struggled with this film. The cinematography is some of the best and most compelling that I've ever seen. The opening shot of the train at night is absolutely gorgeous and you could hang a print on your wall. The genius slide into Dutch angles at the climax hammer home the subject's emotional state in an unforgettable moment . However, the plot is as fairly mundane and the characters uninteresting and underdeveloped.The script was developed from a 1-act play and it shows. There are many unnecessary shots and scenes seeming to pad the running time by detailing how the female lead spends her mundane days. Perhaps the point, to make the viewer feel the character's boredom. If so, it works. The character's motivations are never adequately portrayed and there's never any real understanding of why they are drawn together other than the idea that they are both bored and lonely.The film relies heavily on voice-over narration to somewhat clumsily exposit plot details, character emotions, motivations, and background in order to avoid having to show them to us. As a result, I never felt any kind of emotional bond with the characters or cared about their situation. The narration claims that they are desperately in love, but not so much as to even consider the idea of divorce. The social norms at the time frown heavily on divorce, but it hardly seems rational to consider suicide as an alternative to social judgement and alienation, especially when one of the characters seems content to relocate to a different content.The beautifully filmed climax at the train station is at once amazing and confusing. It's never really developed or set up by the film, it seems to come out of no where and the idea of committing suicide over a lost love that someone has kissed a handful of times and no more than that seems like the worst kind of melodrama. I wondered if this was really a story about a woman struggling with deep depression and trauma who was able to find respite in a short love affair. It's not, but that would have been a much more interesting story.",

            "content": "Here's a classic that aged like 1940s swimwear: tight, functional, and still moderately attractive, but not as revealing as it was in its day.\"Brief Encounter\" opens with 1940s housewife Laura Jesson (Celia Johnson) coming home after a miserable afternoon. She joins her husband (Cyril Raymond) by the fireplace and descends into thought, reflecting on the affair that just ended.Her first encounter with Dr. Alec Harvey (Trevor Howard) was brief indeed. In the doorpost of a station refreshment room he helped remove a piece of grit from her eye and quickly walked on. From then on, the two meet regularly on their way through the city and steadily fall in love, despite having families of their own.\"Brief Encounter\" is regarded as one of the great films by British critics, not in the last place because it addresses the buttoned-up bourgeois morale that dominated UK society for decades. It was directed by David Lean (who had 'almost 1,000 women') and written by Noel Coward (a homosexual), both of whom had a bone to pick with British morality. However, despite these credentials, the film lives up only in part to its reputation.Its problems all concern Laura in some way or another. Lean does not succeed in nuancing Johnson's aggressively monotone performance, nor in having the dialogue flow in a manner that seems remotely natural. And while the blabbering side characters flow confidently from Coward's pen, he seems clueless when it comes to creating a three-dimensional female lead. The stiffly delivered stream-of-conscious narration conjures the image of a thin-haired forty-year-old sweating in his attempts to imagine what a married woman thinks like. Some pretty cinematography and a hearty scooping of hunkering Rachmaninov hardly ease the swallow.But if \"Brief Encounter\" is a so-so character piece, its merit as historical allegory is considerable. The ever-present sense of judgment surrounding the core romance weighs on the viewer with increasing relentlessness. In one of the film's best sequences, Laura joins Alec in an apartment a friend let him use, with the unspoken intent of having sex. When said friend returns home early Laura has to escape through the back door, but she is heard. It is then up to Alec to explain his intentions.His friend is the film's embodiment of the English upper-middle-class man that would rather die than acknowledge the mere suggestion of such vulgarity. When Alec has apologised and turns to leave shame, he halts him: 'Perhaps you could let me have my latchkey back. I only have two and I'm so afraid of losing them.' The mixture of impeccable posture and evident contempt hits harder than any blow would.As such we find \"Brief Encounter\" still a key work in the British cinematic canon, but its importance as historical document exceeds its qualities as a film. Returning to the bathing suit simile: you might want a quaint postcard of one, but would you really don the polka-dot yourself?",

The backdrop of dullness and every-day tedium only seems to enhance the violent and overpowering passions of the two central characters. Lean's subtle direction and the use of black-and-white cinematography are impressive and preferable to his work in later overblown epics whilst Rachmanioff's Second Piano Concerto fits the story perfectly. Trevor Howard is also faultless in his film debut but it's Celia Johnson's understated performance as the tragic Laura that lives in the memory. Her portrayal of the trapped housewife is without equal in modern cinema. This is a film full of soul and emotion and gets better with every viewing.",

Namely, because the convoluted sentimentality concerning a lock frustration of this kind of human beings. In which those characters were at the mood, from a background installed before the war and whose intimacy was in the apparently shy approach. David Lean in this movie also had had as target two married people, whom after the war meet in a railway station and made love in a hotel nearby, during a short time before different trains arrive. At where after they go, but in opposed directions for the beginning of a more democratic open society and less asphyxiated for their common and illusory sensibility, as it was usual for other couples of the kind in a Europe with problems of reconstruction at the time. This movie symbolizes also the provincial middle class that took the opportunity to travel to the capital, should be for a little more of individual freedom than staying in family at countryside. Another point is the profession of the masculine character, a physician : it's more easy for the director at the time, when pressure out of the story was tremendous about prudery and boundary for mental strip-tease in private life as occasional adultery, cutting the tradition of the scarlet letter and interdiction or banning a woman from the community. No. It was an answer to the anxiety of all Mrs. Miniver of the time by the behavior of this dame here, but the medical exercise was also targeted as a kind of candidate to D.Juan, which it was not easy for the reputation of the gynecologists. The trend of this movie from that time just after the WWII finished, it was mainly the fact that most of its duration is plenty with the talks between two human beings, which was also somewhat forcing the traditional dramatic stand in such a motion pictures, about their common past failed because destiny and out of their own will for having another bid for the flashback of destroyed happiness. What does pretend David Lean with this kind of story, as a piece of lifetime, illustrated mainly by such a couple in tourism at the interior in this moment of the history ? Could be that the strength of the conflict between them became the lost opportunity of the past, it was also good as motivation for the explanatory agreement of their lives in the past, for this dramatic conception stepping up the feelings of such a carnality for their attractive skins and flesh desires for both - with the smell around them mixed in such a chemical magnetism of their eyes and noses -, compensation and too conciliation of the wounds from the two minds. Because the lack of self-esteem at the beginning of another cycle of affects, which put the physician alone and at the departure to South Africa ; and indifference for what the others are thinking about them, if they were next in the same kind of dilemma, as a situation concealed on the funny anonymous state of developing much more absence of prejudice and less irritating prude of themselves.",

I used to visit my grandparents in Silverdale, near Carnforth, and recently I went back to the area to see it all again. I am thrilled that the location used for the station scenes in Brief Encounter has been restored and is open for visitors (it is still a working station).The lovely thing about Carnforth station is that wide ramp coming up to the platform, up which Laura walked or ran to catch her train. The huge clock is important in the film, and there is a restored one there now. The place called \"Milford Junction\" in the film is fictitious and I am not sure where it's supposed to be, but judging by the accents of everyone in the film it must be in the Home Counties! So it seems charmingly weird that there are platform signs in plain view in the film showing that trains are going to Lancaster and Morecambe, Leeds and Bradford (as there really were at Carnforth and the trains still go to those places). Either David Lean didn't notice (which seems unlikely) or he had a sense of humour, or he wanted to confuse us about where this place was. It's a classic, obviously, and the issues raised are as relevant today as they were in 1946.The love story stands up even though the clipped accents can seem strange to us. Because of the time in which the story took place, the outcome was different from what it might be today. Nevertheless, the central tragedy of the story makes it memorable - the fact that 2 people couldn't be together for whatever reason (a completely believable one). The soundtrack is also perfect and as a David Lean fan, this is one of his best. Celia Johnson and Trevor Howard's performances were immense and pitched just right. It's a British classic.",

This movie played hopscotch across this boundary multiple times. Lean, like De Sica, is a man of capacious spirit and broad passions. As such, he is not especially good with nuances. The question to ask when you watch his films is: to which end of the spectrum does the film incline? What a polar director- good and bad range along opposite sides of the gulf. \"Summertime\", to my mind, is a far superior film, though much of that can be attributed to Lean's exuberant use of color and Hepburn's shattering fragility.

The cinematography and direction is superb (you'd expect nothing less from David Lean), the acting wonderful (despite an inclination to ham things up from the comic characters!) and of course the music - Rachmaninov might have written his second Piano Concerto especially for the film, it goes so beautifully with the various moods and drama that the script evokes.I was not alive in 1945, but I sense that \"Brief Encounter\" captures the zeitgeist perfectly. I just about remember steam trains and I'm sure that when I was about 5 years old the station buffet at Clapham Junction (and everywhere else at that time) strongly resembled the one used in the film (A visit to Carnforth station is a must for fans, by the way!) The glimpse into the comfortable, if bland, existence of the bourgeoisie of the time is revealing, and the tension of the restrained feelings is, at times, almost unbearable! Howard and Johnson capture this tension so well. The 'forbidden' love of these terribly British upper middle class people has been read as a metaphor for homosexual love, of course. However, in a rather drab post-war world, it must have been refreshing to observe such wild passion in the cinema!Finally, I love the almost perfect structure of this film - the opening scene which is the closing scene and the subsequent flashback works so well on a dramatic level. Above all, I suppose I love the very Britishness of \"Brief Encounter\" - the class divisions in post-war England are starkly revealed. What a unique glimpse into a particular moment in time, long since disappeared, and although the film is very specific in terms of time and place, it deals with universal feelings.",

Muted and laced with prickly repartee a bit beyond the threshold of real-world conversation, Coward struck a fine balance between the humor and gravity of emotions roiling just skin-deep under the constraints imposed by British politesse. In that light, the main disappointment in an otherwise moving work of art lies in the overly long, stultifying voice-overs.I first heard \"Brief Encounter\" on the radio at least 65 years ago. One memory has stuck with me from that broadcast, the dullish, nicey-nice husband, played by Nigel Bruce (then the preeminent Dr. Watson to Basil Rathbone's Sherlock Holmes) and his warm-hearted lines addressed to his wife toward the end of the play.

Thus, the relationship which is established between both of them is forbidden. The director of this film is Sir David Lean. He made a lot of famous and hugely successful films. For example:Great Expectations or Oliver Twist, and many more. However, Brief Encounter isn't his best film. Although I don't like this movie, it has been adapted to the theater, opera and, even, to the radio. Nevertheless, there are a few details which I like. One of them is the set. I think the director didn't resort to unreal sets. Moreover, this movie has a great moral content.

For instance, Psycho, Titanic, Jaws, etc. Even David Lean has directed much more interesting and amazingly entertaining movies. In conclusion, it's excruciatingly tedious. Maybe I don't like this movie because of the leading actress indecision. But, as I've said, if you want to see something this movie could be OK. Glenda Bello Burguet",

            "content": "First of all, anyone who decides to watch this movie must not be ignorant to the British way of life in the 1940's, particularly in the case of the middle class. It focuses on a woman in her thirties who, being married to a dullard with children, finds a new, exciting, yet adulterous love with a doctor. Being set in the 1940's, the shamefulness of adultery is even greater in society, and seems almost as if it does not exist. This, therefore, is why the relationship is doomed from the start, and both lovers are unfree to let their passion and love overtake. A previous reviewer of this film appeared to detest the film for it's lead female star's performance, the dialogue and basic storyline, for reasons that suggested they did not understand, or were unaware of the behaviour of society, and different social classes during the period it was filmed and set. Although opinions vary, I think I can safely say that this film is fantastic, and beautifully acted, written (Noel Coward), shot and directed (David Lean). If you are oblivious to what you should expect from this film, at least give it a chance. So many people believe this to be one of the greatest films ever made, and certainly Britain's finest classic. The archaicness of the language, although very British and very proper, gives the film part of its superiority and integrity; and if you really can't get to grips with it, then just have a little giggle at it instead. Another contribution to the film's beauty is the location and how it is shot. Naturally a black and white film, it is set mainly at a railway station, where the unfortunate lovers first, and often, meet. Shots of the steam engines passing in and out and racing by, silhouettes of the characters on lamp lit streets and various camera angles representing the character's state of mind, make this film particularly unique.The diegetic music is that of the classical Rachmaninov concerto, which only makes the film more dramatic and poignant. Also, the occasional powerful sound effects of the trains, contribute to the feelings of the main female lead character, mostly when she is guilt ridden and fearful about the affair. This brings us to the performances. Trevor Howard plays Dr Alec Harvey, whilst Celia Johnson plays Laura Jesson. Howard acts to perfection, with a handsome charming look, and flawless gentlemanly qualities, adding slight sneakiness, which allows his character to persuade Laura into confessing her mutual love for him. Yet it is without a doubt a film dominated by the graceful screen presence of Celia Johnson. She is magnificent as the distraught lovelorn woman, who can make any female viewer completely relate to the feelings of loosing the man they truly love. The grief in her voice reveals her pain and a sense of drained, non feeling acquired after having to let go of Alec, and never seeing him again. She is a natural beauty with, what Alec mentions, her wide eyes, and despite the previous reviewer disagreeing, an outstanding, well pronouncing speaking voice, projected mainly(and most memorably)in narration throughout the film. You may more than likely find the idea of a man and woman, who know very little about each other, falling in love a bit far fetched, however you may also let that slip aside, as the love between them becomes tragic and heartachingly painful due to the circumstances, and because both characters are restricted from taking it too far, and have to learn to let go.Please give this film a chance, as I'm sure you won't find anything else quite like it.",

            "content": "BRIEF ENCOUNTER has three elements that insure it will always stay a classic: 1) the performances of Celia Johnson and Trevor Howard as lovers who, for dull and practical reasons, can not be together; 2) the memorable black and white imagery of steam trains rushing through the station in which much of the movie takes place; and 3) Sergei Rachmaninoff's excellent score (the composer, of course, died before the movie's production, but his concerto is edited to fit the movie so seamlessly that it could easily pass for an original score). The movie,however, also has one element that works against it, and that is the incessant voice over narration by Johnson's character. The movie does need the narration, but it needs much less of it. When the narration begins, it reveals an inner world that is hidden to the other characters, and establishes a dramatic contrast. But, as the movie continues, the narration more often than not merely restates what we see on screen and adds little to it. In fact, it sometimes ends up actually dulling what we see on screen rather than enhancing it. Despite the negative impact of Johnson's narration, the movie still has two powerful performances by actors playing somewhat passive characters. The stereotypical British reticence which is played for laughs so often is played here with a convincing, undeniable seriousness. And, since it is a David Lean movie after all, the setting of the film is a memorable character. The trains (which seem to make an appearance in every one of his good movies...) sweep people away, tempt suicide, and generally overpower the humans with their loud rumble and their giant clouds of smoke. When not around the train station, we are in various drab apartment interiors, and, in one dramatic break, on a stone bridge in a meadow. The characters would not be so intriguing if their lives did not play against such rich settings. BRIEF ENCOUNTER is especially interesting when played against BEFORE SUNRISE, another story of a brief encounter between two lovers on a train. While that film, made in 1995, is more true to how European and American lovers behave today, BRIEF ENCOUNTER is still perhaps more true to how we actually feel. BEFORE SUNRISE is a charming account of an encounter, but BRIEF ENCOUNTER really invites you to think about the choices that its characters make. Perhaps its greatest achievement is that it manages to dramatize its characters so intensely while still leaving the option of judgment to the viewer when the movie ends.The Criterion DVD, however, still leaves much to be desired. It does not even have a making of featurette. All it has is an old-fashioned commentary taken from the laserdisc, recorded at the time when audio commentaries were merely papers read out loud, rather than true commentaries.",

This would explain why the husband wished to turn the music from the radio down and also why it dominates the whole story: because Laura is thinking actually of Alec Harvey, even talking in her thoughts to her husband. Why i make this link? Because that was Alec Harvey who spoke of the odd musician in the restaurant and also asked Laura whether she herself played the piano.

Oh, that's right - without her, his dinner would not be on the table at six every evening. He was a complete dork.They did a great job making those other women in the film come across as gibbering idiots - I never knew people could talk so fast and say absolutely nothing! Especially that one that interrupts Laura and Alec in the caf\u00e9 at their farewell. Jeez, you just want to knock her one on the head with a baseball bat to get her to take a breath! I didn't see what was so special about the doctor, though, that she should go so nuts over him. He was nice to her, but I would have thought he would have been a little more dashing or better looking or something... I don't know, he seemed a little geeky to me. Not that Laura was all that, either - she sorta reminded me of an Edsel with the headlights set a little too far apart... those googly eyes! Goof: In the final caf\u00e9 scene, the distance shot shows Laura sitting in her chair wearing just her suit and hat.

The England it depicts has completely and utterly disappeared, so all we are left with is what in it is universal and timeless.  It is a superb account of the shared sufferings of human beings, even when they are living calm, peaceful and relatively prosperous lives. It is sympathetic to every character, yet depicts acute suffering amongst those who feel they have no right to feel any sorrow of any kind. So English of an old fashioned kind.  It is a masterpiece.  Coward's script s pure Coward, so much so that it occasionally sounds like a parody of his rhetorical style, but ultimately it works perfectly.  I don't know how such a now historically, technically and socially distant film can be so affecting and seem so relevant, but it does.  It is also beautifully photographed and gives us a wonderful glimpse into the world of our grandparents that really existed.

A remarkably simple story of 2 souls crossing paths and becoming permanently intertwined, it throws up issues regarding class, social standing and what it means to truly love a person for who they are, regardless of their background. Celia Johnson, in possession of one of cinemas most expressive faces, relates a story, supposedly to her husband but more to herself, which she could have told entirely without saying a single world; her face tells us everything we need to know. Trevor Howard makes a perfect companion, playing a man far more sure of what he wants, while also being at the mercy of his feelings, which he wears completely on his sleeve. I feel like their falling in love happens to quickly and too soon, and that a little bit more of a build up would have made it more convincing. But when they profess their love for one another you really feel it, and it's not hard to believe that they would have given up their ways of life for each other, even if it would have been scandalous all those decades ago. It's a very talky film, and the dialogue is often so fast that you might struggle to understand what's just been said. Despite these niggles, Brief Encounter is a classic of British cinema for a reason, and just one of many influential projects in David Lean's enviable filmography.",

            "content": "A realistic romantic affair between married lovers.\n\nDavid Lean's romance drama Brief Encounter (1945) is like the original In the Mood for Love with its nuanced portrayal of a desired affair between unhappy spouses. I love how Brief Encounter is told from the woman's perspective as it feels rare to find a film willing to take female desire seriously as an act of emotional satisfaction instead of simply a sexual theme. The impossibility of their love feels all the more enticing as you really are rooting for them to run away and be happy, knowing full well it would be wrong. David Lean's direction wants you to empathize with the adulterers, so see how miserable spouses may feel in a potentially loveless marriage.\n\nOn this Valentine's Day, I've been feeling lonely and wanted to cheer up by watching something romantic and Brief Encounter destroyed me. David Lean captures passionate love and tender flirting in his most succinct classic at a brief 86 minutes. Brief Encounters is an emotional epic as it lets your heart swell to massive proportions with a hopeless romantic sentiment. I think Brief Encounter is easily Lean's best film alongside Lawrence of Arabia.\n\nCelia Johnson gives her leading lady Laura Jesson her best tortured performance that glows with affection for her new love, while also endearing you to her playfully flirty lady. Her character shyly starts to relate to a fun partner, who shows her real attention. Her big, dark eyes draw you, so that you gaze into them the entire film, while she narrates her short fling with a married doctor. Her narration is honest as she admits her conflicted feelings, while expressing how tiresome the gossiping women around her are with their hilariously incessant talking.\n\nTrevor Howard and Celia Johnson have nice chemistry with subtle acting as they must quietly interact, so as not to get caught kissing in each other's arms. Howard's Dr. Alec Harvey is fairly open about his growing love for Laura Jesson in these sincere admissions of adoration. I really appreciate how Celia Johnson looks down or her eyes shine with an inner flame because she cannot quite confess her passionate love yet. They are extraordinarily well cast too because they look like they could be any random stranger in the audience, who happens to stumble into one another.\n\nNoel Coward's writing is ahead of his time with scandalous subjects like infidelity and a woman having the agency to actually admit to herself that she's unhappy in her marriage. All the conversations are dripping with curiosity, sincerity, patience, fondness, and even lust. I think Coward bravely bursts with passion for such a taboo subject matter in 1945. Robert Krasker's cinematography looks like a film noir, but the crime is adultery. All the shadowy silhouettes and endless fog with Brief Encounter a mysterious atmosphere that intrigues you immediately. Charles Staffell's fog effects look believable as do all the impenetrable darkness cascading across this dreary train station. Jack Harris' editing is quite clever and creative with sharp cuts from memory to reality or fade outs to a singular romantic encounter of note. \n\nIn short, I highly recommend Brief Encounter for David Lean's precise shots and dreamily romantic atmosphere. Celia Johnson should have won Best Actress at The Oscars for her timeless depiction of natural romantic need.",

It\u2019s heartwarming and makes you feel good when two people who are meant to be together find one another in a film, and recognize it from the first moment they meet. But when conflict arises in the story, I need something more to ground their relationship than that intangible feeling of \u201cfalling in love.\u201d And that\u2019s where my big problem with Brief Encounter begins. This is a film about two married people that become smitten with one another, despite the fact that they have perfectly wonderful home lives with caring spouses and children. I want to make it clear that I don\u2019t think this is a far-fetched story, or that people are not tempted to stray in scenarios very similar to the one we see in this film. In fact, part of what I dislike about the movie is the way the desires of these two people develops, because it feels exactly like the kind of slow fade that leads to any number of bad decisions we all make. I\u2019m also not claiming that I\u2019m somehow better than the main characters. While I haven\u2019t been unfaithful in my marriage, I\u2019ve certainly made mistakes and have regrets. But that doesn\u2019t mean I get enjoyment out of watching other people show terrible judgement. What irritates me even more in Brief Encounter is that the movie attempts to justify the actions of the two lead characters by blaming it all on \u201clove.\u201d I\u2019m not sure if I\u2019m just old-fashioned or if I simply have a different mentality about this kind of thing than the rest of the world. But in my opinion, there was never any love experienced between these two characters. What they shared was some lustful desire, but they pretty it up by labeling it love because that removes some of their culpability. In truth, the most loving thing that either of these characters do for one another is when the doctor leaves and moves away with his family in order to break off this damaging relationship. That\u2019s my problem with movies like this, it feels as though the filmmakers expect me to be heartbroken at the end, but I\u2019m actually glad that their tryst is stopped. The other weird thing that bugged me in Brief Encounter is the internalized voiceover. It felt unnecessary, and it was made even weirder because it was spoken like an interactive discussion when she wasn\u2019t actually talking to anyone. There simply wasn\u2019t much that I could care about in this film, and it makes me angry that infidelity stories like this or The Bridges of Madison County are presented as \u201cromances.\u201d",

I understand that for the era it was fairly revolutionary, but I suppose that's what both the cruelty of time and the increase of human depravity will do to a society's shock value threshold. It's not a bad movie in any respect, I'll add. The acting is respectable, the camerawork is inventive, and even the ending had me sighing in relief.

            "content": "'Brief Encounter' grabs you from the start, with a chatterbox interrupting a man and a woman who are silently sitting together in the caf\u00e9 of a train station, but were clearly in the middle of a conversation before she arrived.  When the man (Trevor Howard) eventually departs politely for his train, he presses the shoulder of the woman (Celia Johnson) and slips out through the door.  She then takes the train with her friend, who continues to talk incessantly despite her obvious signs of grief.  It's at this point that director David Lean first brilliantly utilizes an interior monologue in the mind of the woman.  This leads to these fantastic lines:\n\n\"This can't last. This misery can't last. I must remember that and try to control myself. Nothing lasts really. Neither happiness nor despair. Not even life lasts very long. There'll come a time in the future when I shan't mind about this anymore, when I can look back and say quite peacefully and cheerfully 'how silly I was'.  No, no, I don't want that time to come ever. I want to remember every minute, always, always to the end of my days.\"\n\nI was hooked from then on, and the film never let up.  Based on a play by Noel Coward, it's very well written, and very well executed.  The British production has an intelligent, indie feel to it, it's without major stars, and has nothing resembling the fanfare typical of Hollywood movies at the time.  Rachmaninoff's Piano Concerto No. 2 provides a fantastic score, with dramatic moments, and following the ebb and flow of emotions perfectly.  \n\nAs you can probably guess, the pair are involved in forbidden love.  After returning home to her kind but somewhat boring husband, who takes more interest in crossword puzzles than in her, she recounts the past, starting again with a brilliant bit of us listening in to her thoughts:\n\n\"Fred, dear Fred. There's so much that I want to say to you. You're the only one in the world with enough wisdom and gentleness to understand. If only it was somebody else's story and not mine. As it is, you're the only one in the world that I can never tell. Never never. Because even if I waited until we were old, old people and told you then, you'd be bound to look back over the years and be hurt. And my dear, I don't want you to be hurt. You see, we're a happily married couple and let's never forget that. This is my home. You're my husband. And my children are upstairs in bed. I'm a happily married woman - or I was, rather, until a few weeks ago. This is my whole world, and it's enough, or rather, it was until a few weeks ago. But, oh, Fred, I've been so foolish. I've fallen in love. I'm an ordinary woman. I didn't think such violent things could happen to ordinary people.\"\n\nIn telling the story, the film captures what it's like to feel yourself slowly but inexorably drawn to another person, even while knowing it's wrong, feeling guilt, and telling yourself that it can't go on.  Those early innocent moments lead to those with the subtlest of sparks, and soon the two are on each other's minds throughout the week, until they might meet again each Thursday.  It's honest, and far from tawdry.  The pair simply fall in love, and as he puts it, \"It's no use pretending that it hasn't happened because it has.\"  It's romantic, and heartbreaking at the same time.\n\nLean gives us several fantastic scenes on the railway platform.  I also loved the one with Johnson running down the street in the rain, and another with the camera twisting to an angle as it slowly zooms in on her face when he's left.  The inclusion of the relationship between an older caf\u00e9 owner (Joyce Carey) and a night watchman (Stanley Holloway) is playful and fun, and helps provide a counterpoint to the main story.  There is a lot to love here, including a powerful ending.",

It's so perfect, in fact, that it's really not right that such a masterpiece should be discussed in the context of another, but since I watched this film due to its relation to Carol, I nevertheless spent quite a bit of its runtime thinking about the thematic choices Haynes made when he decided to incorporate brief elements from this film in his own and will do so anyway.\n\nBrief Encounter is not a subtle film because it doesn't have to be. There is no subtext, as the entirety of the story is communicated through Laura's inner monologue, thoughts and feelings laid out along with the plot. When first considering the inclusion of this film's beginning/end structure, I briefly entertained the notion that this was a mistake, a reimagining of a straight story used to communicate a gay one to an audience and a regressive bit of \"gay via straight signifiers\" filmmaking that limits so much of queer cinema. I quickly decided that that was idiotic and moved on.\n\nIt's obvious that, by deliberately choosing to reference this film, Haynes wanted to make clear the difference between gay modes of communication and straight ones, pointing to the similarities of the two couples' situations (forbidden love) while ultimately revealing that though society forces straight people into rigid structures that prevent them from attaining happiness, it does so to an unbelievable degree for queer people. This is true to the point that we have been forced to create happiness in the midst of oppression, subtle looks and touches communicating what we can't say out loud, each little signal an act of rebellious defiance against a system that hates us. Haynes is a postmodern director, and so he made his film the way he did to make a specific point: Carol incorporates bits of Brief Encounter in order to proclaim its own emancipation, to state that it will refuse to compromise for the sake of straight people, to show that we have to hide twice as hard as any straight couple, to make clear that we will always survive even when society criminalizes our very existence.\n\nBoth films are masterpieces, but for entirely different reasons, Brief Encounter specifically for the reasons stated previously. Carol, on the other hand, is perfect because it adds a level to what its predecessor was trying to say, taking the universal text of what came before and making it queer. That little act of bold defiance is one that might not have ever been done before, making the film just as vital as the work it echoes because ultimately, we're just as important as those that would like to snuff out our own brand of love.",

But only to the external observer: inside Laura Jesson, everything does. I enjoyed this even more now that it's squarely aimed at my new middle-aged, spouse-and-two-kids, London commuter demographic; we might not be much to look at it, but there's a lot going on under the surface, you'd better believe it.",

Brief Encounter is reasonably original, especially for its time, in that both the man and woman in the relationship are married, and not to each other.\n\nThe movie starts well, showing how they first meet, how they start to see more of each other, some amusing incidents along the way, and how they fall in love.  But they're married, so you know this can't be a simple relationship.  You think all along: can this have a happy ending, and what is a happy ending in this context?  Do you even approve of the relationship?\n\nAll this told with some wonderful old English settings, 1940s sensibilities and charm.\n\nUnfortunately, after this intriguing dilemma, the movie then drifts for a period and then we have a conclusion that is a damp squib.  Writer Noel Coward and director David Lean pull their punches and the ending feels like a cop-out.  Very disappointing, especially after all that went before it.\n\nGood performances by Trevor Howard and Celia Johnson in the lead roles.",

VCB is vastly more embellished in plot and liberal in tone, and it had a much stronger emotional pull on me. It's a bit harder to buy into the mores of the 1940s, and maybe for that reason or just because of the writing I didn't get much out of this emotionally. It's so overwhelmingly naive in tone and cliche in plot, and if it weren't so well executed I would have found it cloying and unpleasant. As it is, Celia Johnson has enough pathos and reserve to sell the character. \n\nRachmaninoff's 2nd piano concert is maybe the perfect musical pairing for this movie. Like Brief Encounter, it's ultra-sentimental but pulls it off effortlessly, to great effect. It's a great choice, though it is a bit odd when they reuse the same excerpts at different points in the story.",
