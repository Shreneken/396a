            "content": "The second of the Bogey and Bacall pairings has Humphrey Bogart playing his second pulp fiction detective for the screen. Previously he had done Sam Spade in The Maltese Falcon and now he's Philip Marlowe in The Big Sleep. He's at the top of his game in both.Bogey's been hired by Philip Waldron to get rid of a blackmailer that's got something on one of his daughters, the amoral and disturbed Martha Vickers. The older daughter Lauren Bacall intrigues Bogey a bit more when she tries to pry into exactly what Bogart is doing for her father. Seems as though a family chauffeur has gone missing a while back and the family is concerned on a number of levels.The plot glides into the question of the missing chauffeur and Bogart meets all kinds of interesting characters before all the mysteries are solved.The Big Sleep proved that the teaming on screen of Bogey and Bacall was no flash in the pan success that they had in Two Have and Have Not. They are surrounded with a great cast of players. Dorothy Malone got her first notice on film as a bookstore proprietor. Elisha Cook essays one of his typical roles as a luckless fall guy. John Ridgely is properly menacing as gambler Eddie Mars.But my favorite in this film has always been Bob Steele as the vicious killer Canino who Ridgely has on retainer. Why Bob Steele wasted his time with two bit grade C westerns when he was doing work like this is beyond me. My favorite scene in The Big Sleep has always been when Bogey blasts Steele after Bacall has diverted his attention. When you hear Bogart utter those words, \"over here, Canino\" he was never more chilling or menacing on the screen before or after.Set comfortably within it's time in the Forties, The Big Sleep still packs quite a wallop for today's audience. May you never have Humphrey Bogart looking to nail you for some misdeed.",

            "content": "THE BIG SLEEP has a reputation for being a film that gets lost in its own complexity and which fails to clearly identify all the perpetrators of all the murders that litter its scenes. There is a certain truth to this: like the Raymond Chandler novel on which it is based, the plot is extremely complicated, and it requires the viewer to mentally track an unexpected number of characters--including two characters that never appear on screen, a pivotal character who doesn't actually have any lines, and a character who is frequently mentioned but doesn't appear until near the film's conclusion. There is not, however, as much truth to the accusation that the film never exposes all the killers: only one killer is not specifically identified, but even so his identity is very clearly implied.All this having been said, THE BIG SLEEP is one helluva movie. In general, the story concerns the wealthy Sternwood family, which consists of an aging father and two \"pretty and pretty wild\" daughters--one of whom, Carmen, is being victimized by a blackmailer. P.I. Philip Marlowe is hired to get rid of the blackmailer, but an unexpected murder complicates matters... and touches off a series of killings by a number of parties who have covert interests in the Sternwood family.Perhaps the most amazing thing about the film is that you don't actually have to pick apart the complicated story in order to enjoy it. The script is famous for its witty lines and sleek sexual innuendo--much of it lifted directly from Chandler's novel--and the cast is a dream come true. Philip Marlowe would be played by a great many actors, but none of them ever bested Humphrey Bogart, who splendidly captures the feel of Chandler's original creation; with the role of Vivien Sternwood Lauren Bacall gives what might be the finest performance of her screen career; and the chemistry between the two is everything you've ever heard. The supporting cast is superlative, all the way from Martha Vickers' neurotic turn as Carmen Sternwood to Bob Steele's purring hit-man Canino. There's simply not a false note to be found any where. Although the film really pre-dates the film noir movement the entire look of THE BIG SLEEP anticipates noir to a remarkable degree--it would be tremendously influential--and director Hawks gives everything a sharp edge from start to finish.Two versions of THE BIG SLEEP are included on the DVD: the film as it was originally shot and the film as it was released to theatres in 1946. The actual differences between the two are fairly slight, but they prove significant. Although the original version is somewhat easier to follow in terms of story, it lacks the flash that makes the theatrical version such a memorable experience; it is easy to see why Hawks elected to rescript and reshoot several key scenes as well as add new ones, and both newcomers and old fans will have fun comparing the two. The DVD also includes an enjoyable documentary on the differences between the films and the motivations behind them.I don't usually comment on picture quality unless there is a glaring issue, but several reviewers have noted portions of this print have a flicker or seem a bit washed out. I noticed these problems, but I can't say that they in any way distracted from my enjoyment of the film, and they certainly don't prevent me from recommending it--be it on the big screen, television, video or this DVD. And I recommend it very, very strongly indeed.Gary F. Taylor, aka GFT, Amazon Reviewer",

            "content": "Philip Marlowe is a private detective who is hired by General Sternwood to investigate a case of blackmail involving his youngest daughters' gambling debts.  The General has lost his right hand man, Shaun Regan, and needs a man able to do the job.  Marlowe investigates the blackmailer, Geiger and tails him to a house. When he hears shots he rushes in to find Geiger dead and Carmen strung out of her head.  With Geiger dead, Marlowe follows the trail to Joe Brody, who also gets rubbed out, and then to Eddie Mars, who's wife is rumoured to have run off with Regan.  As he digs deeper Marlowe finds only corruption and deceit but also starts to fall for the General's eldest daughter, Vivian Rutledge.Despite the fact that this film is overly complicated at times, it still stands out as a classic bit of noir, even if aspects other than the plot are what really makes it as good as it is.  The plot starts simply but quickly becomes a much more complex beast that moves beyond the issue of blackmail and into murder and lies.  For many viewers, this will be a challenge - so many characters come and go in a short period that it is hard to keep track of how they all relate to each other, and the fact that we're not always supposed to know the connections just makes it more difficult at times. However, if you manage to make it past the midpoint of the film without having totally lost track of people then it becomes clearer towards the end. It may sound silly, but this time I watched the film with a pen and paper to help me keep track of who's who - it really helped; but it is worth noting that, even with help, bits of the plot will make little sense at times.The focus of the film is not the plot - the focus of the film I think is the relationship dynamic between Marlowe and Vivian.  In this regard the film really works well.  The relationship between is tough but trusting no matter what; at times it is a little hard to see the affection between the two being real or realistic but it is the dialogue between the two that makes it work despite this.  The writing is fantastic, the scenes between them do fizzle but the dialogue across the whole film is perfect: it is tough, memorable and basically it is the way I'm sure we all wish we could talk at some point in our lives!  The material is also quite daring for the period - murder and tough talk was not unusual but the issues of drugs and nymphomania are hardly common subjects for such a mainstream film at the time.The performances are fantastic and perfectly fit the material.  Although this is not my favourite Bogart performance (I love him in Maltese Falcon) he is still brilliant here, he is cool, tough and intelligent - at times his power over women threatens to be unrealistic but his presence makes it work. His character is not as complex as in Maltese Falcon but Bogart does harried and world-weary better than anyone else.  Bacall is great even if I don't personally find her that attractive; she has a great chemistry with Bogart and delivers the goods.  Vickers is also good but in a less subtle role.  The support cast includes tough turns from Cook, Heydt and Ridgely all of whom convince as tough guys but not to the point where they threaten to eclipse the shining star of Bogart.Overall this is a classic film despite the fact that the plot is too difficult at times and doesn't always hang together.  The flaws here are covered by a tough script that delivers the goods in terms of both dialogue and characters.  The plot is a complex web but the basic energy and relationship dynamics keep the film moving really well through scenes that continue to show their influence in films today.  Not a perfect film but a great bit of noir that is likely to be loved by the vast majority of viewers - just keep that pen and paper to hand though!",

            "content": "The Big Sleep (1946)Even hardened film noir and Humphrey Bogart fans admit that this is one confusing movie. It makes sense, but it is edited down to such essentials, and it barrels along with the intensity of a bullet in a smoky canyon using overlapping dialog e and a shower of names, half of whom end up dead, it's really an impossible job for a mortal viewer.And that's where it's aura, and magic, and legend, lie. It's a great film, and if it's flawed by its excessive velocity, it's defined by it, too. Enjoy Bogart as such, and Lauren Bacall for her sporadic appearances, and for Elisha Cook Jr. for a brief, wonderful splash. All the side characters, even the ones who are clearly only characters, are dripping with criminal drama. The photography is dark but never obscure, the action is fast but never unreasonable, and the lines are classic noir.In fact, the dialog, if you are paying attention, is one of the gems of 1940s movies--really witty and cutting, and cunning. The movie is brilliant top to bottom, if only you could keep track of what was going on. Suggestions: Read the plot in the Wikipedia entry before you watch the movie a second time. (The first time, just dive and and get lost. It's too much fun to care, if you can let go.) Watch Bogart's delivery, his physical presence, his wherewithal. Listen to Bacall sing (pretty darned good). Watch the amazing light and camera work (Sydney Hickox) with it's constantly moving perspective and layers of action. Follow the score (Max Steiner) which is appropriately restrained, turning just slightly when Bogart and Bacall are in scenes together. Howard Hawks pulls of a quirky masterpiece here. You get to the end and frankly don't care too much, perhaps, about the outcome, about who survives and what their futures might hold. But that's fine, too. It might just make you want to watch it again. Good filmmaking does that.",

            "content": "Many fans of this classic film are drawn to it because of Bogie and Bacall, who do indeed make a deft acting duo. Here, Bogie plays Philip Marlowe, the tough talking, street savvy PI, who has his roots in the crime novels of writer Raymond Chandler. Bacall plays Vivian Sternwood, the adult daughter of a wealthy man. Vivian is just as tough and cagey as Marlowe. And she has a younger sister named Carmen, who seems to have fallen in with a bad crowd. It's up to Marlowe to investigate, and to save the Sternwood family from financial ruin. \"The Big Sleep\" is a story of blackmail, murder, multiple motives, lies, and all manner of general mayhem.Humphrey Bogart and Lauren Bacall are certainly persuasive in their roles. I also like the script's snappy dialogue. For example, in a conversation with General Sternwood, Marlowe responds: \"Hmm\". Sternwood follows up: \"What does that mean?\" To which Marlowe fires back: \"It means, hmm\". Marvelous.But the film's plot is an incoherent mess. It is hard to follow, disjointed, and has obvious lapses. Further, secondary characters (Geiger, Brody, Mars, et.al.), and their interrelationships, are poorly defined. To some extent that vagueness and lack of precision are fairly common in 1940's pulp detective stories.The best approach to \"The Big Sleep\" is to engulf the relationship between Marlowe and Vivian, marvel at the acting of Bogie and Bacall, enjoy the witty dialogue, and ignore the discombobulated plot.",

            "content": "Starting out, I must advise that my review here is for the 1945 pre-release version of \"The Big Sleep\", which had quite a few scenes redone prior to it's release to general audiences in October 1946. With filming already completed by Spring of 1945, there were two main reasons for the year and a half delay; first, with World War II underway, Warner Brothers felt compelled to get it's war related films into theaters while they were still timely. Secondly, Producer/Director Howard Hawks was convinced he had to re-shoot some scenes involving Lauren Bacall, who was critically panned in her latest film, \"Confidential Agent\" with Charles Boyer. In the original print, Bacall is presented in a few scenes wearing a distracting veil, and it's her more glamorous side that the studio needed to capitalize on.Much has been made of the complexity of the \"The Big Sleep\", and deservedly so. On my latest viewing, I took pen in hand to keep track of the characters and situations. That only helped so much. For example, Humprey Bogart's character, private detective Philip Marlowe is tailing rare book dealer Arthur Gwynne Geiger for his client General Sternwood; Geiger allegedly holds gambling debts involving a few thousand dollars on Sternwood's daughter Carmen (Martha Vickers). Following Geiger's auto to his residence, Marlowe studies his surroundings, and then hears a woman's scream and gunshots, followed immediately by two cars careening out of the driveway. Entering the house, he discovers the lifeless body of Geiger, and a spaced out Carmen Sternwood. Out of this scenario are offered two, maybe three possibilities. First, General Sternwood's chauffeur Owen Taylor is implicated, as he had fallen in love with Carmen and wanted to defend her from blackmail. Secondly, a shady Geiger accomplice Joe Brody may have done it, OR may have chased the guilty Taylor from the crime scene either to retrieve some incriminating blackmail film or to remove him as a potential witness. OR, the spaced out Carmen could have killed Geiger herself, and although this wasn't offered as a possibility in the film, she WAS present, and may have been entirely coherent when the murder was committed.And this is how the story proceeds. Even more characters are introduced to spin off the original plot, and Marlowe is off investigating the proprietor of a gambling house named Eddie Mars, Brody's accomplice Agnes Lozier, the salesgirl at the rare bookstore, and Harry Jones (Elisha Cook Jr.), a tail on Marlowe who gets rubbed out after setting up a meeting with Agnes that might provide more information to go on.All of the intrigue aside, it's the chemistry once again between Bogey and by now, Mrs. Bogey, Lauren Bacall that propels this movie forward. Whether just sizing each other up at the beginning of the film, or as unwilling accomplices and possible lovers by film's end, it's the snappy banter and smoldering tension between the two that put the sizzle into this edgy noir thriller. As if to prove how great an actor Bogart was, this film offers us a glimpse at his incredible range. Of course I'm referring to the bookstore scene in which Bogey portrays a nerdy client seeking information on a non existent rare book. With a mere upturn of his hat's brim and a cleverly positioned pair of glasses, Bogart completely transforms into an almost unrecognizable comic character who befuddles and infuriates the store's proprietress. He follows that up with a walk across the street, and a double entendre filled conversation with a disarmingly seductive Dorothy Malone in a scene that could have lingered into X-rated territory if not for the task at hand.One could go on and on about \"The Big Sleep\", and others have, but to appreciate the film's mystery, darkness and noir complexity you'll have to view it. But don't try to solve the case, you won't want to hurt yourself.",

            "review_title": "Classic private eye tale with Bogart and Bacall in fine form",
            "content": "This classic of American cinema, actually made during the war and released in 1946, got a whole nation of young men affecting Bogey mannerisms, raising their eyebrows or showing their teeth while grimacing, and especially pulling on their earlobes while deep in thought, a smoking cigarette dangling between their lips. It was the genius of Howard Hawks, who directed, to do everything possible to make Humphrey Bogart a matin\u00e9e idol, including having Lauren Bacall slump down in the car seat so as not to tower over him. With this movie a new kind of cinematic hero was created, the existential PI, a seemingly ordinary looking guy gifted with street smarts and easy courage, admired by men, and adored by women.Hawks fashioned this, part of the Bogart legend, with a noire script penned by William Faulkner, et al., adapted from Raymond Chandler's first novel, that sparkled with spiffy lines, intriguing characters, danger and a not entirely serious attention to plot detail. Hawks surrounded Bogey with admiring dames, beginning with the sexy Martha Vickers who tries to jump into his lap while he's still standing (as Marlowe tells General Sternwood), and ending with the incomparable Lauren Bacall, looking beguiling, beautiful and mysteriously seductive. In fact, every female in the cast wants to get her hands on Bogey, including a quick and easy Dorothy Malone, bored in her specs while clerking at a book store. Hawks also employed some very fine character actors, most notably Elisa Cook Jr., and Bob Steele, the former as always, the little guy crook, (Harry Jones), and the latter, as often seen in westerns, the mindless heavy with a gun (Canino). Charles Waldron played the world-weary general and Charles D. Brown was the butler.I was reminded somehow of the old Charlie Chan movies with the dark, mysterious, ornately-decorated interiors heavily carpeted and studded with ethnic statuettes, especially the house on Laverne Terrace that Bogey keeps coming back to, and the glass-paned doors and glass-separated cubicals of his office and others. The atmospheric L.A. created here has been much admired and imitated, cf., Chinatown (1974) and L.A. Confidential (1997), two very superior movies that continued the tradition.In comparing this to the book, I have to say it's a little on the white-washed side, and not as clearly drawn--'confused' some have said. Of course liberties were taken with Chandler's novel to make it romantic. Chandler's novel emphasizes cynicism, and romance takes a back seat to manliness and loyalty to the client. An especially striking difference is in the character of General Sternwood's younger daughter, Carmen. She is vividly drawn in the book as something of monster, a degenerate sex kitten who would try and do just about anything. She is twice encountered butt naked by Marlowe, once in his bed. Being the sterling guy he is, he turns her away. (Right. I could do that.) Another difference is in all the sleazy details about the low-life underworld of Los Angeles that are omitted or glossed over in the film, including Geiger's homosexuality and his gay house guest, Carol Lundgren. (Of course there was a code in those days.) Bacall's character in the movie is actually a fusion of Vivian and Mona Mars from the book, made nice for movie fans. In the book, Marlowe kisses Vivian, but turns down her invitation for more intimate contact. In the movie, of course, there is no way Bogart is going to say 'no' to Bacall. In the book Marlowe seems to prefer whiskey to women.Most of the sharp dialogue comes right from Chandler's novel, including Bogart's grinning line, 'Such a lot of guns around town, and so few brains.' Interesting is the little joke on Bogart in the opening scene. In the novel, Chandler's hero is greeted by the purring Carmen with the words, 'Tall, aren't you?' Well, the one thing Bogey ain't is tall, and so in the movie Carmen says, 'You're not very tall, are you?' Bogart comes back with, 'I try to be.' In the novel, Marlowe says, 'I didn't mean to be.'By the way, the film features Bacall singing a forties tune and looking mighty good doing it.(Note: Over 500 of my movie reviews are now available in my book \"Cut to the Chaise Lounge or I Can't Believe I Swallowed the Remote!\" Get it at Amazon!)",

            "content": "THE BIG SLEEP is one of the more entertaining private eye movies I have seen.  A dying old man has two beautiful, uncontrollable daughters: Vivien (Lauren Bacall), and Carmen (Martha Vickers).  Carmen is being blackmailed, and her father hires P.I. Christopher Marlowe (the beloved Humphrey Bogart) to get the blackmailer off her back.  But Marlowe finds that somebody else has done this job for him: the blackmailer is murdered almost under his nose.  And as he puts it, \"That didn't stop things. That just starts 'em.\"I have not read Raymond Chandler's novel, on which this movie was based, but those who have say the title refers to death.  That is never explained in the movie.  Howard Hawks packs so much plot into 114 minutes of footage that the movie feels like it's bursting at the seams.  The story is not incomprehensible as some would have it; while there are many improbable coincidences, there is no element I can point to and say \"That couldn't have happened.\"  (Although I'm still not quite sure how Carmen got into Marlowe's apartment).  True, the plot really is very hard to follow, and Marlowe's periodic explanations of events, without which the movie would indeed be nonsensical, smack more of inspired guesswork than logical deduction.  But the furious pace at which the plot unfolds lends more excitement to the movie than nine out of ten of today's lazily plotted would-be thrillers.THE BIG SLEEP's greatest strength is its delightfully droll dialogue.  When Chandler writes the novel and then Faulkner helps adapt it, you expect some verbal fireworks, and you sure do get them.  \"How do you like your brandy?\" \"In a glass.\" - \"You're not very tall, are you?\" \"I try to be.\" - \"I'm getting cuter every minute.\" - \"Such a lot of guns around town, and so few brains.\" - \"Is it any of your business?\" \"I could make it my business.\" \"I could make your business mine.\"  \"You wouldn't like it. The pay's too small.\" - \"She tried to sit in my lap while I was standing up.\"  Bogie and Bacall get two of the best exchanges; they have a horse-racing discussion where racy double-entendres are dripping like savory sauce off of every word, and they also get a truly hilarious telephone conversation where Marlowe convinces Vivien not to call the police.But THE BIG SLEEP has a harder side that is also effective.  It is shockingly violent for a movie produced under the stern eyes of the Hayes code censors.  The movie is too unpredictable to generate much suspense (you can't dread something you don't know is going to happen), but the ending is one of the most intense, nailbiting scenes you'll ever see.The 1940s were not a great era for film music, which makes Max Steiner's brooding score all the more impressive.  The print I saw was very low-quality, so I can't judge the cinematography.The acting is wonderful.  Bogart gets to show his chops at one point by switching off the hard-boiled personality he developed for THE MALTESE FALCON and impersonating an antiquarian bookworm.  Bacall radiates class whether she's at ease smoking in a cafe or outwitting a man holding her at gunpoint.  Martha Vickers' Carmen strikes the perfect balance of appealing seductiveness and outright nastiness.One final note: this movie is almost Bond-like in terms of the number of appallingly beautiful women Marlowe accidentally encounters, all of whom seem to have a burning desire for him.  Even his taxi driver wants him. Dorothy Malone, whose character name we never learn, plays the sexiest book seller you will ever meet (and yes, she wears glasses; eat your heart out, Dorothy Parker!). Minus fifty points for credibility, plus a hundred points for entertainment.  Regrettably, I cannot promise similar thrills for the female audience; it just kind of depends on how you like Men In Suits.Rating: ***1/2 out of ****.",

I've developed my own beliefs on who did what to who and in what order over the years, and I would need some convincing to change my mind, but I think that is not why I turn back to this one again and again. Initially, private detective Philip Marlowe (Bogart) is summoned to the Sternwood mansion by General Sternwood who wants Marlowe to resolve his daughter Carmen's gambling debts. But soon Marlowe is caught in a web of murder, extortion, pornography, love triangles, organized crime, and missing persons. No wonder the plot is convoluted. It would have to be so to get past the production code! All along , everyone is telling Marlowe all events resolve around Regan, but Marlowe didn't care. Instead what everyone cares about is that the Bogie and Bacall characters can live on and develop that sizzling relationship in peace. Warner Bros capitalized on the PR aspect of the event of releasing this film and made it less dark and a lot more romantic than the source material and who-killed-who became a side show instead of the core of the film.What with Marlowe flirting or more than flirting with a book store proprietor, an eager cabby, Vivian Sternwood and her thumb sucking sister (even little Jonesy winked at him once, didn't he?), I'm surprised the private eye had the chance to solve any crimes at all. Bogart's Marlowe was sort of a '40s forerunner to James Bond as a chick magnet. It was adolescent male fantasizing, Warners style. Not only that but this Marlowe was clever enough to indulge in racetrack double entendres with a glamorous, sophisticated looking babe like Lauren Bacall. No wonder viewers aren't terribly concerned if they can figure out the convoluted plot when they can have fun, sexy times with this particular noir crowd.So stick with this for the clever dialogue, for the atmosphere, for the weird characters, and most of all the chemistry that is Bogart and Bacall. Everything else is just window dressing.",

Bogart and Bacall star in this grand black and white thriller. Private eye Philip Marlowe(Bogart)is hired by a very wealthy family to protect a young woman from her own indiscretions and along the way there is murder, blackmail, car chases and gun play to deal with. Right smack in the middle of this complex case Marlowe finds time to fall in love with his client's eldest daughter(Bacall). Murder galore does not phase our cool detective with the cigarette hanging from his thin lips.Flawless acting from Bogart and Bacall. There is a very talented supporting cast that includes Regis Toomey, Martha Vickers, Elisha Cook Jr., Bob Steele and John Ridgely. Then there is the charming Dorothy Malone that sizzles in her short time on screen. Very witty dialogue and colorful characters make this a classic among classics.",

General Sternwood, who lives with his pretty and wild daughters Vivian Rutledge (Lauren Bacall) and Carmen Sternwood (Martha Vickers), explains that he has been blackmailed by the bookseller Arthur Geiger on Carmen debts in gambling. The general also tells that he had been blackmailed in the past by the scum Joe Brody (Louis Jean Heydt), but his Irish friend and shamus Sean Reagan resolved the situation. Then Sean decided to leave L. A. with Mona Mars (Peggy Knudsen), the wife of casino owner Eddie Mars (John Ridgely), but now Sean has gone missing. Vivian meets Marlowe when he is leaving the house and tells that she had borrowed money from Eddie Mars to pay for photos of Carmen.Marlowe follows Geiger from his bookstore home and when he hears Carmen screaming, he discovers that Geiger is dead, Carmen is doped and also a hidden camera missing the film with photos of Carmen. Marlowe brings Carmen home and when he returns, Geiger's body is vanished. Then Chief Inspector Bernie Ohls (Regis Toomey) invites his friend Marlowe to go with him to see a body of the general's driver in a Packard that has been withdrawn from the pier. Marlowe connects the dots and is evolved by a complex network of blackmails and deaths while Vivian and he fall in love with each other.\"The Big Sleep\" is a splendid film-noir, actually one of the best I have ever seen, directed by Howard Hawks with a magnificent story of blackmail and deaths and stunning performances. Lauren Bacall is the perfect femme fatale and Humphrey Bogart, my favorite actor ever, has another top-notch performance. The plot has many details and sleazy characters and I intend to see this movie again in a near future to \"catch\" details that might have gone missing. Last but not the least, I found the explanation of the title in Google that means \"death\" and is explained in the novel. My vote is nine.Title (Brazil): \"\u00c0 Beira do Abismo\" (\"On the Edge of the Abyss\")",

Bogie, playing Philip Marlowe - one of his finer roles, commands the screen, wise-cracking with felons and coppers alike, giving a few beatings and taking a lot himself. The night scenes are wonderfully shot, with shadow and fog effects being used perfectly. The main reason to watch this movie, though, are the scenes between Bogart and Bacall. Their on-screen chemistry (fueled by their off-screen romance) lends the most weight to the film. My favorite of their exchanges is when Bogart, tied up yet still smoking, tells Bacall to \"take this cigarette out of my mouth\". And, of course, they kiss. A short while later, she helps Bogie take out a hired killer. Bogie remarks \"I didn't think they made them like that anymore.\" They certainly don't.",

Even those who love this film like I do will usually honestly admit that the murder mystery is muddled and made little sense. However, this doesn't really seem to matter that much since the mood, acting and dialog are so exceptional, this seems to be a film that can even overcome plot problems.The best part about this film, by far, is Humphrey Bogart. His Phillip Marlowe is terrific--sarcastic, tough and blunt. Hearing him spit out great one-liners is something you just have to see to believe and even some of the minor scenes (such as the one in the book shop) come off wonderfully due to his characterization. It sure helped that he was ably assisted by a great supporting staff (especially Lauren Bacall), but even without them this would have been a first-rate film due to Bogey.The direction also deserves a lot of credit. Howard Hawkes sure did a good job of setting the Film Noir atmosphere. Exceptional camera work, music, lighting and pacing all made this a sit on the edge of your seat type of film.As for the story, Marlowe is called in to help a rich old man find a missing friend. However, what happens next and all the twists and turns just don't add up to a lot--especially when you find out who did the crime and why. But don't worry--you can actually look past this!! By the way, although I loved Bogart, I also really loved Robert Montgomery's version of this character in THE LADY IN THE LAKE. While not necessarily better or worse than Bogey's version of the character, he was nastier and more sarcastic (while Bogart was a little more self-confident and tough). In fact, I am shocked this other movie isn't just as famous as THE BIG SLEEP--it definitely deserves to be and would make a great double-feature.",

            "content": "I'm trying to piece together a story about noir, what it is, how it works and where it came from. It seems to me that noir -- what I call noir -- is bigger than what it is normally tagged as. Its deep, a new notion of how the world works and how we narrate it. I think like jazz, its peculiarly American in origin. The backbone of noir, I believe comes from a stew of experiments in the thirties with legs in the detective story and the movie-about-movies or \"shows.\" It became more distinctly cinematic and tied to formal narrative devices with \"Citizen Kane.\" That's my story and I intend sticking to it. After that, you can see how the young thing was shaped, not entirely with deliberation. I think this was a milestone of noir and much of it was by accident.The books are based on one simple notion, I believe, that Marlowe was the only soul we see that isn't trying to force the universe, trying to be someone. He just is. He just accepts the world and what it serves up, perhaps noticing that the world seems to be designing coincidental impediments. (These are created by us watching, but that's another story.)Plus, he is primarily motivated to \"see\" what things are all about. Halfway through this, he apparently solves the problem, but still has to keep looking, \"detecting.\" Now for the accidental amplification of the genre. Books nearly always are reduced in translating to film. There's just more space for more events in books. But with this type of mystery, you just cannot take bits out. So Faulkner and partner kept it all in, all wedged together. Its too much and confuses the ordinary viewer, at least the kind who really wants to \"understand.\" But the whole point of noir as it has grown up is that fate is capricious and that the world presents some \"dark logic\" that we can't quite reach. We can sort out the shreds that fall from the sky, but beyond is some machine that we can never see.So the fact that this movie makes less sense than we expect matters. I think it is an accident of talent, that it wasn't intended. But its effective as all getout to be encountered with confusion just as Marlowe is, though he gets to pull his ear. And we just get to pull our eyes.There's a strange overlay between the zen acceptance that Marlowe has for the inexplicable world, and the fact that overtly horny women flock to him. I think the attraction is less the usual wisdom and strength, but a similar sort of calmness that comes from simple recognition that the world isn't logical. Ted's evaluation: Worth watching.",

            "content": "Read all of my reviews at www.midnitcafe.blogspot.com This classic film noir has very few of techniques generally associated with noir. It contains no skewed camera angles; and though it is darkly lit, it is not overcome with murky, obscuring shadows. The hero is not down-and-out, poor, or desperate. There is no retrospective narration, or flashbacks. Yet, the Big Sleep is widely considered to be one of the very best of this genre. It is a cynical, perverse, murderous world filled with loads of confusing action and unknown motives. It is, in fact, one of the great films of one of the screens greatest actors (for my personal top 10 actors list, click here), and most talented directors.It was directed by Howard Hawks fresh off of the successful pairing of Humphrey Bogart and Lauren Becall in To Have and Have Not. The two star here again and it is easy to see why they made another two films together. Based on a Raymond Chandler novel of the same name, many people complain that this film is incomprehensible. Somewhat famously it is reported that Bogart and Hawks, after arguing over who killed one of the characters, called up Chandler to get the correct answer. Chandler didn't have the slightest idea, for the novel is rather vague on this point. It's true that both the novel and film leave many plot points as to who did what to whom more than unclear, but there is so much style in both that it's hard to make a convincing argument against them.A good deal of the confusion within the film comes from the production codes in effect at the time it was produced. Chandler's novel deals with murder, homosexuality, heterosexuality, and pornography. At the time, these things were deemed unfit to show on a movie screen and so Hawks had to hint at them using various subtle methods. For instance, when Carmen Sternwood (Martha Vickers) is found by detective Phillip Marlow (Bogart) in the novel she is completely nude and sitting posed for a hidden camera. Since pornography is explicitly against code, in the movie she is dressed in a silky, Japanese gown. There is still a hidden camera, and its missing film becomes a catalyst for much of the action in the film. We must infer from the exotic nature of the gown that there was more than just pictures of a woman in a gown going on. There are many similar instances in the film like this. For an audience member who has not read the book, they must pay close attention to the subtext, or the film will seem baffling.Personally, I am very much a fan of the book, and all of Chandler's work. While I appreciate that some of the finer plot points are a bit vague in this film, I also understand that the film succeeds not in the details of the story, but in a sinister sense of style. The film oozes with a dark, disquieting atmosphere. Nearly everyone Marlowe meets is hiding something, and is of less than upstanding moral character. Hawks does a great job of keeping nearly every scene in the dark or in the rain, or both. There are so many characters coming in and out of the shadows and with their own shady character that it is difficult to keep up.Bogart, of course, does a marvelous job as Marlowe. He seems to understand a lot more information than the audience is ever given. Chandler wrote Marlowe as a detective who sticks by his own set up morals, remaining somewhat of a noble creature trying to stay afloat amongst the muck and sewers of the city. Lauren Bacall does a very good job portraying Vivian Sternwood Rutledge, in a role that is much different than the one in the book. Like many films from this era, they create a romance that wasn't really in the source material. I don't mind though, because Bogart and Bacall really sizzle.What can I say that hasn't been said before? This is really classic noir at its best. It's got Bogart and Bacall. It was directed by Howard Hawks, written by William Faulkner from a novel by Raymond Chandler. What more could a lover of classic cinema want? More reviews at www.midnitcafe.blogspot.com",

            "content": "Considered as a classic example of the film noir style, Howard Hawks' \"The Big Sleep\" is famous not only for the complexity of its convoluted plot, but for the high quality of its dialogs as well as the legendary coupling of Humphrey Bogart and Lauren Bacall. Oddly enough, the movie's most famous traits were not in the film's original version, and became the result of a series of changes and additions Hawks did to the film from the day when the shooting ended until the day it was released. The original version had less romance, and a better explained plot; it was only after the success of the two stars as a couple that it was decided to add more scenes between them, and \"The Big Sleep\" as we know it was born. Time proved that the changes were worthy, as now that both versions are available it is easy to pick a favorite. This review of \"The Big Sleep\" is based on the 1946 final version, as personally I find it superior to the less convoluted original (but definitely less fun) cut.In \"The Big Sleep\", private detective Philip Marlowe (Bogart) makes a visit to Gen. Sternwood (Charles Waldron), an old handicapped man who has a mission for him. Sternwood tells Marlowe that he wants him to take care of the gambling debts of her younger daughter Carmen (Martha Vickers), as she is being blackmailed by a bookseller named Geiger (an uncredited Theodore Von Eltz). Marlowe takes the job, but before leaving he is confronted by Sternwood's other daughter, Vivian (Lauren Bacall), who wants Marlowe to find out what happened to their former employee Sean Regan, who simply disappeared under mysterious circumstances. Marlow finds Geiger and follows him home, but the plot thickens when he finds Geiger dead in his home, killed by a mysterious man and with Carmen in the crime scene while high on drugs. But this death will only be the beginning.Based on Raymond Chandler's novel of the same name, \"The Big Sleep\" is definitely one wild ride to a dark world filled with gangsters, femme fatals, pornographers and drug addicts; in simple words, the epitome of Film Noir stories with the character of Philip Marlow as one of the genre's biggest icon. The script (by the excellent team of William Faulkner, Leigh Brackett and Jules Furthman) follows closely the novel's story, but of course, with many interesting changes and additions, most of them being the exchanges of dialogs between Bogart and Bacall in an attempt to cash in in the couple's popularity. It is in this series of dialogs where the magic of \"The Big Sleep\" is, as the focus on the relationship between the couple drives the movie and makes the complex ambiguity of the plot feel more accessible and enjoyable.As usual, Howard Hawks' direction is direct and straightforward, letting the dialogs to drive the movie but at the same keeping true to the Noir style of its hard boiled source novel. It is easy to notice that Hawks considered the characters to be more important than his story, as the film focuses entirely on their actions instead of the results of those actions. It is this style what makes the film work, as he makes sure that the many supporting characters of the film receive a moment to shine in scenes of great emotion and juicy lines of dialog. Visually, the film is a textbook of how to make a movie in the Noir style, with the excellent cinematography by Sidney Hickox being a highlight of the movie, and the subtle yet appropriate score by Max Steiner creating the proper atmosphere of decadence that runs through the film as Marlowe gets deeper and deeper inside this dark world.Being that the screenplay makes the characters the main focus, the performances by the cast are essential for the film. Bogart's portrayal of Raymond Chandler's best-known character, Phillip Marlowe, easily ranks as one of the icons of the Film Noir genre, in a legendary performance only equaled by Lauren Bacall's Vivan Sternwood. Their chemistry on screen was explosive, and Hawks knew exactly how to use it for his benefit. \"The Big Sleep\" is certainly one of the best (if not THE best) film with the legendary couple. As many have pointed out, Martha Vickers is a highlight of the film, stealing every scene she is in with her delightful portrayal of the wild spoiled brat Carmen Sternwood. A remarkable group of actors make the supporting roles of the film to come alive, each one of them adding their talents to the movie with excellent results. Dorothy Malone and Elisha Cook Jr. stand out among the rest by stealing the small scenes they appear.The overtly complex plot may be considered by many as a flaw of the movie, specially as it is hard to follow at first and it gives the feeling of constant plot holes. However, this ambiguous way of telling the story is just another device Hawks uses to keep the story character driven. It may seem at first that Hawks doesn't care too much for the plot (and on a second thought, maybe he really didn't), but in the end this overtly complex puzzle reflects what Marlowe himself is experiencing, and in many ways makes the audience to identify with the detective and his work trying to solve the mystery of who is blackmailing who. True, it is certainly difficult to follow the plot at first, but the way Faulkner and company have written the script certainly makes up for this difficulty.Probably \"The Big Sleep\" may not be everybody's cup of tea, but personally I think that anyone interested in the history of cinema should give it a try. It showcases some of the best performances ever and shows Howard Hawks, that famous Jack of all trades, proving his talent and versatility in the Film Noir genre. A real classic. 9/10",

            "content": "I take exception to something that previous commentator David R. Baker of Missouri makes in reference to film music. He states: \"The 1940s was not a great era for film music which makes Max Steiner's brooding score even more impressive.\" HE'S GOT TO BE KIDDING! Did he ever hear of Erich Wolfgang Korngold, Bernard Herrmann, Alfred Newman, Miklos Rozsa and Aaron Copland, all of whom did their best work in the 1940s? And Max Steiner himself was responsible for such outstanding scores as those for 'Casablanca', 'Now, Voyager', 'Johnny Belinda' and 'The Letter'. The others had a hand in 'The Song of Bernadette', 'The Sea Hawk', 'Citizen Kane', 'The Heiress', 'The Lost Weekend' and 'Spellbound', among many others. In fact, the 1940s is often referred to as The Golden Age of Film Composers. And another mistake, Bogey is Philip Marlowe--not Christopher Marlowe. As for 'The Big Sleep', I agree, Max Steiner's score was an important ingredient. So are the quirky characters, including actresses Dorothy Malone (as an oversexed bookstore owner who seduces Bogey on a rainy day afternoon) and Martha Vickers as the thumb-sucking sister of Bacall, a nymphomaniac, whom Marlowe refers to as having tried to sit on his lap while he was standing up--just one of the punchy lines in the witty script. Confusion abounds everywhere in the plot that's as full of holes as swiss cheese--but who cares? It's all done in mock-serious style with the usual Warner Bros. finesse in black and white cinematography. Only jarring note is the script's insistence that every female in the cast sees Bogey as a sex symbol--something even Bogart would have found amusing since he never considered himself that much of a looker. He makes Philip Marlowe a believable enough character and the part fits him like a glove. After the preview, the studio added additional Bogart-Bacall scenes of hanky panky to give the film an added zing. It works!",

            "content": "The best noirs tend to offer complex labyrinths in which we enjoy getting lost. They portray conspiratorial worlds in which invisible forces pull and push us around like puppets on a string. In this regard, what made \"The Maltese Falcon\", a 1941 noir directed by John Huston, influential was the way it communicated this conspiracy. In Huston's film, dialogue was fired rapidly, his sets were resolutely claustrophobic, his plot was impenetrable and his characters existed within a mass of hazy motivations, unspoken schemes and sinister intentions. The very cinematic language of the film was oppressive, every detail, word and object actively working against the viewer. It was all very murky.And of course it was up to our intrepid avatar, Humphrey Bogart, to cutlass his way through this conspiratorial web. Through him we hacked and we slashed, peeling back the layers, trying to get at some truth. Whether we got there or not was unimportant. Noir's joy is in being tangled within a spider web of fate.Released five years after \"The Maltese Falcon\", Howard Hawks' \"The Big Sleep\" is up to the same game. Hawks takes Huston's aesthetic, inserts a little sex appeal in the form of Lauren Bacall, amps up the sexual innuendos and expands his sets, but for the most part achieves exactly what \"The Maltese Falcon\" did, Hawks creating a moody, seamy and oppressively dark world of scheming players, pawns and puppet masters.Humphrey Bogart plays our hero, of course. His character was called Sam Spade in \"The Maltese Falcon\" and Philip Marlowe here, but for the most part he's the same guy in both, Bogart bringing the same mixture of cynicism, wit, intelligence, coolness, sexiness and toughness that makes most of his better films memorable.As for the plot, nobody knows what's going on and that's how it should be. A great film noir is an almost tactile thing. Like reading a good Chandler, Thompson or Connelly novel, noir immerses you in a world that is as thick as it is black. \"Falcon\" and \"Sleep\" may not have the technical wizardry or scope of later film noirs, but they have a purity and immediacy that most of those films lack; an abstract quality, the essence of noir distilled down to the bare essentials.It's therefore interesting to observe how noir has expanded as the decades have rolled by. In the 40s and 50s directors like Hawks and Huston gave us noirs confined to tiny rooms, their characters battling their way from one small sound-stage to the next. The genre then expanded with the political thrillers of the 70s and sci-fi movies of the 80s. Nowadays noirs have the expansiveness of \"The X Files\" or \"The Wire\", their characters at the mercy of a far wider-range of forces (politics, science, sex, religion, money, mysticism, Hollywood, genetics, technology, screenwriters, family, fate, bureaucracy etc).The best modern noirs take place in a forever un-mappable universe, their heroes increasingly lost, set adrift in a world of conspiratorial influences so vast that the human mind can do nothing but succumb. True noirs of today can be found in films as widely divergent as \"Ran\", \"Inland Empire\", \"Mulholland Drive\", \"The Wire\", \"Code 46\", \"Boarding Gate\", \"Eyes Wide Shut\" etc etc. Of course nobody thinks of these films as \"film noirs\". They much rather champion self consciously emulative fare like \"Blood Simple\", \"Fargo\", \"Brick\", \"LA Confidential\" or \"Red Rock West\". But those are all retrograde noirs, nostalgic, content to ape convention rather than explore the world as better directors do. They reduce noir to a aesthetic choice, a kind of chic, designer existentialism, rather than anything more socially, psychologically or philosophically meaningful.What all these later noirs lack, though, is Bogart. Actor Cary Grant, in a 1946 letter to a British publisher, said it best: \"Bogart is so much better than any other tough-guy actor. As we say here, Bogart can be tough without a gun. Also he has a sense of humour that contains that grating undertone of contempt.\" What Grant forgets to mention is that Bogart also exuded a kind of cool sexuality. No surprise that he married Lauren Bacall, 25 years his junior.10/10 \u2013 Along with \"The Maltese Falcon\", this is a genre defining classic which plays as well today as it did over a half century ago. Bogey, Bacall and Hawks teamed up in 1944 for another (arguably) masterpiece, \"To Have And Have Not\". Worth multiple viewings.",

            "content": "This is one of the first real noir films I've seen, and I must say, it was every bit as good as I had expected. I have been interested in the genre for a while, after seeing many attempts at noir, and quite a few neo-noir film that impressed and entertained me. Still, nothing beats, or even matches, the real thing. I had also been wanting to see a film with the famous Humphrey Bogart, so when I found this film at the local library and discovered that it perfectly fit the criteria, I naturally borrowed it immediately. I was surprised by how interesting and entertaining this film was, and the incredibly sharp(not to mention equally well-delivered) dialog impressed me greatly. You just don't get that with modern Hollywood cinema. The plot is exceptionally well-written, although quite complex, which will surely discourage some potential viewers. There are a lot of characters to keep track of, something that seems to just be a problem with some of these, as well as neo-noir films(particularly L.A. Confidential). The pace is kind of slow, but not overly so... not like many other films of this period. Also, it seemed more laid-back than slow, kind of like American Pie(but, of course, there's nothing else that this film has in common with that... at all). The acting is top-notch. Bogart and Bacall are wonderful, and they compliment each other perfectly. They have great on-screen chemistry. The rest of the cast all give convincing performances... I was impressed with Martha Vickers, who was only about 20 years old at the time, and this was apparently her first role that was bigger than a smaller supporting one. The characters are well-written and interesting. I thoroughly enjoyed this movie, and I believe that just about any fan of classical cinema will, too. I recommend this film to anyone who can watch a good movie, even if it is almost 60 years old. It's especially recommended to fans of noir, Humphrey Bogart and/or Lauren Bacall. 10/10",

Even though there was a twenty-five year age difference between them, I believe that they really did love each other. In this film, they don't seem to have enough chemistry to make a very mediocre script watchable.I couldn't finish Raymond Chandler's novel (I still have yet to get more than halfway through), and I could barely finish this movie. It's just so...dull. To apply that famous quote from Grand Hotel, \"People come, people go, and nothing ever happens.\" That just about sums up this movie. We're introduced to a lot of characters, but most of them don't end up doing much. Some people get killed, but you couldn't care less. And I'd be pressed to remember what happens in the rest of this film. I have a faint recollection of Bogart being tied to a chair, but that's it. That's all.Bogart played Bogart- and he definitely had a short-guy complex. He claimed he was 5'8, but Lauren Bacall was 5'8, and she dwarfed him, so he must have been shorter than that.You can tell that he's short, even when he's trying to look imposing, because he's often shot in close-up sitting down, and when he's with his leading lady, she is often sitting down (or hunched over with bare feet, in the case of Ingrid Bergman when filming Casablanca) or they're both sitting and she's sort of slouching. Lauren Bacall plays Bacall, as she often did, but she's one of the more watchable \"actresses who just played themselves\" from her era.I don't understand the obnoxiously high ratings on most Bogart films, but I especially don't understand the high rating for this cure for insomnia. I liked Key Largo and To Have Or Have Not, but I didn't like this one- although to be fair, I liked it more than I liked Dark Passage.I'll give this film a rather weak 4/10.",

            "content": "All the girls/women in Howard Hawk's 1946 Classic 'The Big Sleep' either want to sit in his lap, remove their reading spectacles for or flirt with Humph in one way or another. Even if they don't actually like him, you can almost smell their respect for him.As we all know, the Raymond Chandler story is both complex and intriguing, but that's only half of it. You can stick this movie on umpteen times (as I do) and there's always bits that seem new and fresh, as well as the those that linger long and deep, like a fabulous fragrance. The story, for me is almost second fiddle, though it could easily be first, if I chose it to be. The period detail, the sharp banter and the suspenseful music, the shady characters, the lurking night-time shadows...I could go on.Howard Hawks did make some great films and this must rate as one of his very best. It's become famous for helping to cement Lauren Bacall's life-long relationship with Humph, probably the most loved and respected (and no doubt, envied) courtship in Hollywood history. The black & white photography is remarkably efficient and deceptively simple, yet has all the detail and complexities it needs. There's a real art in making a movie flow so easily and naturally.ALL those who even think of themselves as movie buffs, film-lovers or really anybody, who appreciates a fine film must see The Big Sleep at least once. It does come up on TCM occasionally and it's well worth the effort in tracking down the DVD. Comment Comment | Permalink",

            "content": "If someone asked me to summarize the plot of, say, \"The Treasure of the Sierra Madre,\" I could probably do it easily enough. \"Three men go gold prospecting and one of them goes nuts.\" But Raymond Chandler's plots, of which this is one, defy facile description, let alone analysis.I understand that William Faulkner is given lead credit for the writing but I can't imagine he had very much to do with it. Faulkner wasn't sober all that often -- \"Old corn-drinking mellifluous\", Hemingway called him -- and description, not dialog, was Faulkner's forte anyway.Anyhow I'm not going to bother much with the plot. Half-way through, Humphrey Bogart, as Chandler's private detective, Philip Marlowe, appears to have satisfactorily wrapped up the case assigned to him by General Sternwood. The misbehaviors, legal and otherwise, seem to have been explained to the General and Bogart has been paid off. But Bogart decides to poke around further, on his own, largely because he's fallen in love with Sternwood's daughter, Lauren Bacall, and she with him. If someone can provide a logical link between Bogart's love for Bacall and Bogart's decision to kibbitz in events of no consequence to either of the two, I'd be grateful.Here's what Bogart tells Bacall in his office. \"You're trying to find out what your father hired me to find out and I'm trying to find out why you're trying to find out.\" Amen.And -- let me ramble for a moment -- what in the name of all creatures is Geiger the crooked book dealer up to? \"Blackmail,\" somehow involving photographs of Sternwood's naughtier daughter, Carmen, the one who tries to sit in Bogart's lap while he's standing up. In Chandler's novel at least Marlowe manages to get hold of one of Geiger's books. \"It was filth,\" says Marlowe -- meaning pornography. Okay. That at least tells us what kind of illegal enterprise Geiger was involved in. Simply OWNING a copy of \"Lady Chatterly's Lover\" could wind you up in jail, never mind SELLING it. The \"blackmailing\" business is a poor substitute because it raises additional questions the movie doesn't answer. Who was being blackmailed for what? There are too many other discrepancies between the novel and the film to bother with. And Raymond Chandler and William Faulkner are no more than popular pegs for the real author -- Howard Hawks -- to hang the story on. Bogart is nearly perfect as Philip Marlowe, just as he was nearly perfect as Dashiel Hammett's Sam Spade in the earlier \"The Maltese Falcon.\" Bogart and Hawks had made one previous film together but this was their last. Hawks didn't like Bogart's horning in on his supernally beautiful new find, Lauren Bacall, and sneaking off for mid-afternoon, umm, assignations.What one remembers from \"The Big Sleep\" is not the story but the characters and the exchanges between them. \"The Maltese Falcon\" at least had the search for the black bird to hold it together. This movie has nothing of the sort. Instead, we remember Bogart imitating an androgynous book collector, a scene that was improvised on the spot, as many of Hawks' memorable moments were. The movie has a kind of slapdash quality to it that keeps it from becoming more than an entertainment. Yet -- entertaining it is. It's filled with little quirky gestures, mannerisms, and apothegms. Hawks has Bogart pulling his ear while he's thinking. And it's a wonder that some of the banter between Bogart and Bacall sneaked past the censors.",

There is a famous story about this movie in which co-writer Leigh Brackett called up Chandler late one night to ask him who killed the chauffeur. Even HE didn't know. So, apologies to everybody who gets a headache trying to follow the story, but hey don't sweat the small stuff.The Big Sleep has big pay-offs too. 1. Bogie and Bacall were never better, and their on-screen chemistry is the stuff of legend for good reason: their every scene together is like watching Ali take on Frazier. High powered Old Hollywood screen presence is a thing sorely lacking in what passes for drama in these days of 'reality' TV.2. Whole sections of Chandler's dialogue were lifted right off the page, and this is the movie's best feature. Chandler was a master of hard- boiled dialogue, but he also mixed a lot of really funny bits into the fireworks, as Marlowe verbally probes and challenges everyone he meets. The creators wisely did not set out to 'improve' on Chandler, they just adapted his work for the screen.3. The sort of viper pit atmosphere which modern Hollywood mostly fails to create in its thrillers is here in purest form thanks to smart choices of staging. The posh house in which Bogart/Marlowe meets his client is full of people, none of whom are completely suited to the place. The old general lives in his sauna-like greenhouse, and the girls seem So, right off, you get this eerie feeling of generalized wrongness on a soundstage filled with expensive-looking decor. As characters move to more comfortable surroundings (smoky gambling houses, and other dingy out of the way places of sin) the viewer gets to participate in the full film noir experience: seeing where casual crime encroaches on 'respectable' society as we follow around femmes fatales who are not to be trusted.Great fun.",

These were among those posted on the menus on the wall near the phone where Phil Marlowe (Humphrey Bogart) made some of his calls. As most critics agree, the actual gambling, bootlegging, murder mystery portrayed in this movie is secondary, maybe even unimportant. As the detective, Bogart is always able to arrive at highly accurate conclusions from seemingly vague information. He gets beat up several times, only to doggedly pursue the bad guys in the next scene, all because he was falling in love. The real reason for 'The Big Sleep' is to feature Bogart and Bacall in some very witty dialog, near the beginning of their real-life romance which led to marriage. And, in the end, the private detective gets the 'angel.' One of my favorite lines, addressed to Bogart by two different characters, in different scenes, \"You sure take chances, mister!\", after a Bogart wisecrack. The dialog in this movie is simply remarkable, and I laughed enough times that I could almost call this a 'dark comedy' and keep a straight face.I saw it on DVD from my public library, in glorious black and white, of course. This is a prime example of a classic movie which could have benefited from color photography, to help distinguish the various locations and characters. This DVD release has both the recently-discovered 1945 'dircetors cut', 116 minutes and more linear story telling, plus the 1946 theatrical release, 114 minutes with the re-shot scenes to intensify the Bogart/Bacall interplay.

Too many people look for films that are simple and straight forward. This film is neither, nor does it pretend to be. The book it is based upon is no simple read either. So if you get numb with more than 1 plot in a film, this film is not for you.If your a Bogart fan, or a Bacall fan, this is your film. Bogart is in fine form, almost at sex symbol status at the time this film is made. He carries pretty much the entire film, enduring beatings, getting into murders, & pretty much trying to be a step ahead but sometimes finding himself a step behind. While the film is not perfect, it is pretty close for its genre. You have to enjoy this type film to like it. Taking Chandler's material & having a writer the caliber of William Faulkner working on the script is not going to produce a simple film.This one is getting dated, & while it doesn't quite make it where it is a perfect classic, it is a very good film. Casablanca accidentally worked out to be a better film, but that is only because that one was an assembly line production. This was was expected to be great before it was released. That might be why it does not live up to the expectations, but it is still a very good film.",

            "content": "Raymond Chandler is perhaps as well known as his famous Private Eye in his many books. Further, there are many Hollywood greats who have played his leading detective, from Dick Powell to James Garner. In this early Black and White the studio script written by equally famous William Faulkner, we have our hero Phillip Marlowe (Humphrey Bogart) contracted by rich, retired but concerned General Sternwood (Charles Waldron) to find his daughter Carmen's (Martha Vickers) missing boyfriend. His other daughter Vivian Sternwood (Lauren Bacall) seeks to hamper Marlowe's investigation as she believes it will reveals many other dark family secrets. No sooner does he begin his search for the missing chafferer, when all sorts of mysterious gunmen, blackmailers and a police inspector (Regis Toomey) want to know what he is up to. What begins as a missing person's case, soon leads to extortion, Blackmail and eventually multiple murder. Chandler originally wrote this story with a slight twist in it, yet as one watches the movie, it becomes so confusing, even the author forgets who killed whom. Were it not for excellent character actors like Elisha Cook Jr, Bob Steele and John Ridgely as Eddie Mars, the mystery would go flying off leaving the audience stranded. The trick is to pay close attention and enjoy the magic of Bogie and Becall and interestingly enough you'll find that this film became a Classic because of them.

            "content": "Howard Hawks ranks as one of the least pretentious Hollywood filmmakers. In Todd McCarthy's biography, \"Howard Hawks: The Grey Fox of Hollywood,\" Hawks summed up his philosophy about messages in his movies. \"I never made a statement. Our job is to make entertainment.\" First and foremost, Hawks considered himself a storyteller. Second, actors and actress either adhered to Hawks' dictates or he wrote them out of scenes, sometimes movie entirely, and gave their action to others. Not surprisingly, when Hawks hired William Faulkner, Leigh Brackett, and Jules Furthman to adapt mystery novelist Raymond Chandler's \"The Big Sleep,\" he told them, \"Don't monkey with the book\u0097just make a script out of it. The writing is too good.\" Between 1944 and 1947, Chandler's shabby but heroic private eye Philip Marlowe appeared in four films, including \"Murder, My Sweet\" (1944), \"The Big Sleep\" (1946), \"The Lady in the Lake\" (1947), and \"The Brasher Doubloon\" (1947). During this period, Hollywood filmmakers made what French critics later called 'film noir' movies. Essentially, 'film noir' movies occurred at night either indoors or outdoors. The gritty black & white photography stressed realism, while the low-key lighting forged haunting shadows that boded ill for the characters. Urban thrillers bore the marks of this movement. Flawed male heroes and the treacherous dames that trapped them in a web of intrigue populated these films. The atrocities of World War II and Nazi persecution of the Jews destroyed the innocence of American isolationism and created more mature movies where characters suffered from flaws. Although \"The Big Sleep\" fits into this oeuvre, Hawks shunned such artificial narrative gimmicks.In \"The Big Sleep,\" Philip Marlowe (Humphrey Bogart) works for $25 a day and expenses. He uses his wits and fists to relieve the wealthy but crippled General Sternwood (Charles Waldron) of an extortionist. Sternwood has two daughters: a divorc\u00e9e, Vivian Sternwood Rutledge (Lauren Bacall), and an undisciplined hellion Carmen Sternwood (Martha Vickers). Arthur Gwynn Geiger (Theodore Von Eltz) demands $5-thousand dollars from the General for a sheaf of gambling debts that bear Carmen's signature. No sooner has Marlowe gotten onto the case than an assailant shoots and kills Geiger. Marlowe enters Geiger's house moments after the murder and finds Carmen sitting in a nearby chair drugged out of her mind. He finds a concealed camera but the film has been removed. Marlowe discovers a black book of addresses and hustles Carmen back home. Marlowe's former boss, Chief Inspector Bernie Ohls (Regis Toomey) with the District Attorney's Office, pays him visits at home while Marlowe is examining the black book. Bernie informs him that a Sternwood limo has just been pulled out of the ocean with Owen Taylor, the Sternwood's chauffeur, dead behind the wheel. Ohls wants information. Marlowe explains the blackmail angle and later divulges what happened to Geiger, but he leaves Carmen's part out of the murder.\"The Big Sleep\" qualifies as one of the most convoluted murder mysteries to emerge from Hollywood. Hawks and Bogart argued over the identity of who killed the Sternwood chauffeur. They called Chandler, but he could not conjure up a plausible answer to their question. Eventually, Hawks and his scenarists worked out a solution. The solution to Taylor's murder, however, remained hidden until 1995 when the original version of \"The Big Sleep\" was made available to the public. Originally, Warner Brothers showed the original to American troops overseas, but Jack L. Warner shelved the movie until after the war so the studio could release its other war-themed movies before the Axis surrendered. Meanwhile, Bacall had received abrasive reviews for her performance in \"Confidential Agent\" (1945), and her agent, a worried Charles Feldman, suggested Warner reshoot several scenes and invent new ones to showcase the insolence of Bacall's character. When Warner Brothers released \"The Big Sleep\" in 1946, Hawks had jettisoned the expository Taylor murder solution scene and added other scenes that would have been more appropriate in one of his screwball comedies. Ultimately, Marlowe solves the case, eliminates the villains, and woos Vivian, but the plot makes very little sense, which may account for the film's following. McCarthy quoted Hawks about the director's own perplexity: \"I can't follow the story. I saw some of it on television the other night, and I'd listen to some of the things he'd talk about and it had me thoroughly confused because I hadn't seen it in twenty years.\" Incidentally, the title \"The Big Sleep\" refers to death. The first third of the action makes sense as Hawks and his writers establish the basics. The scene where General Sternwood meets Marlowe is pretty strange. The General suffers from a host of maladies and stews in a hothouse. He indulges in his vices by proxy, watching his visitors drink and smoke and sweat at the same time. The mediocre Burt Reynolds crime comedy \"Shamus\" reversed this scene and had its equivalent character living in a freezer. Anyway, Marlowe encounters a number of sexy ladies, including statuesque Martha Vickers as the looney Sternwood daughter who tries to sit in his lap while he is standing up. There's a funny scene when Marlowe masquerades as a homosexual in Geiger's book store. He flips up his fedora brim, puts on shades, and speaks with a lisp. Later, as if to reinforce Marlowe's red-blooded nature, he visits a book store across the street and the Acme Bookstore proprietress (Dorothy Malone) lets down his hair, locks store door, and shares a bottle of rye with Marlowe while it rains outside.Hawks may have been one of the earliest American filmmakers to ridicule Hollywood conventions. In a scene where a vicious gunsel, Lash Canino (Bob Steele), questions a man (Elisha Cook Jr.) at gunpoint, he threatens to shoot him and adds, \"What do you want me to do, count to three like in the movies?\" B-movie cowboy actor Bob Steele is terrific in his scenes! Don't miss \"The Big Sleep.\"",

Marlowe becomes involved with the oldest daughter , a society dame called Vivian (Lauren Bacall) and her uncontrollable as well as addled sister Carmen (Mary Vickers) who seem unconcerned with disappearances , further complicating the mystery . Only General Sternwood seems concerned as mobsters and hired killers continue to appear in the path of the investigation .This first-rate and entertaining picture draws its riveting tale and power from the interaction of finely drawn roles as well as drama , emotion and moody atmosphere .

Twisted film Noir about murders , troubled relationships , treason , dark secrets , including an unforgettable dialog ; being based on the novel \u00a8Big Sleep\u00a8 and screen-written by the prestigious William Faulkner , Leigh Brackett , Jules Furthman and the same Raymond Chandler . Eager to repeat the success of To have and have not (1944), Warner Bros. studio chief Jack L. Warner gave Howard Hawks $50,000 to purchase the rights for \"The Big Sleep\" ; Hawks bought the rights for $5,000 and pocketed the rest. It has a convoluted and difficult intrigue though stars can quite compensate for some far-fetched moments . It packs a good realization , an original script , haunting atmosphere , intriguing events ; for that reason madness and murder prevail . Here Bogart is extraordinary and as cool as ever ; he plays as the tough-talking P.I. , his scenes with Lauren Bacall are awesome and at their best compared to those they shared in \u00a8Dark passage\u00a8 , \u00a8Key Largo\u00a8 and \u00a8To have and to have not\u00a8 . The couple throws in enough sparks to ignite several lighters . This was the best pairing of cynical Humphrey Bogart and sultry Lauren Bacall , a fifth film was planned several years later, but Bogart died before it could be made . Due to Humphrey Bogart's affair with co-star Lauren Bacall, his marital problems escalated during filming, and his drinking often resulted in his being unable to work. Three months after the film was finished, Bacall and Bogart were married.

            "content": "I've seen The Big Sleep a number of times over the years; it's a terrific movie with witty dialogue, a classic Bogie performance, and an unlikely number of hot women throwing themselves at the middle-aged detective. The great flaw of the film is the story, which by the end is a jumbled, confused mess.I just watched the earlier version of the movie, before Lauren Bacall's agent begged the producer to add and re-shoot scenes because he was afraid the critics would trash her for her performance as they had in her previous film - or at ignore her in favor of Martha Tilton's flashy performance as the kid sister - and he wanted to see a replay of the magic of her first movie with Bogart, To Have and Have Not.The original version of the movie would, like the final version, have been a classic 40s detective movie with a great performance from Bogart and Howard Hawk's crackling direction. It also wouldn't have been said to make no sense. Since The Big Sleep is the only Raymond Chandler book whose plot holds together in the slightest, I always thought the movie didn't make sense because they were flummoxed by how to make a movie about porn and drugs without mentioning either. But that wasn't really the issue. The 1945 version spends time explaining what's going on a couple of times, drawing connections between characters and crimes. Much of this exposition is in one particular scene with the police, and it's gone from the final version. It's understandable that they cut it, as it's a major drag on the action, but its removal makes the film incoherent.While you can argue against making a detective movie no one can follow, the pace was improved (another somewhat overlong scene of Bogart searching a house was also tightened) and the film added its most memorable scene, a suggestive conversation between Bogie and Bacall that is exactly what fans of To Have and Have Not (and Bacall's agent) wanted. The end result is faster paced and even wittier than the first version.If you're only going to watch one version of this, you should certainly watch the 1946 version. But if you're a film buff, or just want to know what on earth was going on in that 1946 movie, check this one out.",

            "content": "The story itself is a mystery, that becomes more of a mystery (and perhaps more frustrating) the more you think about it. Compared to this, The Maltese Falcon's story is for kids (by Dashiell Hammet, another of the prime pulp/detective novelists along with Raymond Chandler). Bogart trades his Sam Spade for Philip Marlowe, an exchange that changes only certain patterns of witty dialog, but not by much. Marlowe is investigating a blackmail on a General, who has two gorgeous, tricky daughters, one of them Carmen Sternwood (Martha Vickers, not given enough credit along with her headlining co-stars), the other Vivian Sternwood (Lauren Bacall, right in her prime). As he digs deeper into a story of murder, corruption, and romance, things may seem out of place, almost confounding, but that is Chandler for you.I have not read all of the Big Sleep, but as a Chandler admirer I always find his use of first person narrative, trademark classical cynicism, and the kind of early day brutal, almost satirical jabs at society (highs and lows) very entertaining, and of the highest caliber of writing. For the screenplay three heavyweights- Leigh Brackett (also responsible for Altman's The Long Goodbye), William Faulkner (one of the key doomed writers of the 20th century), and Jules Furthman- pump together a script that somehow keeps this kind of twisting, keen sense of narrative and humor while still making it commercial. In some ways its as much a romantic tug & pull story, with witty, strong banter going between Bogie and Bacall, as it is one of the key film noirs.But is it as gritty a film noir as some of the less expensive ones like Detour or Gun Crazy? Does that even matter? Does Chandler's sense of the darkness of the world get lost in some of the more typical classic Hollywood aspects of the film? It might for some, especially if you're a purist for the book. Director Howard Hawks, I think, brings a balance to the styles, giving his 'there's danger when there's action' statement some good grounding here. It's almost too good a kind of direction for a film like this- everything is polished and down to the line, and even in the other director's cut from 1945 this is still prevalent. But he never lets loose his actors too far or constricts them from their alluring, striking personalities. On the contrary, this really makes use of its star players so well that at times, even when you're not sure what's going on the script carries it so completely that you just love hearing Bogie and Bacall talk. There's even a sense of whimsy in many of the better scenes. If by the end you can't understand what has happened totally, you may have missed the point- it's about the twists, the style, the kind of popular edginess of the day. It's not with the clarity or humor or experimentation of a classic like the Maltese Falcon, but in its own league the Big Sleep earns its status over time as a must-see.",

            "content": "O.K., so no one really knows what happened in this film (e.g. the actual solution to the mystery is still being debated today, and apparently wasn't known at the time either). It's still a classic, with Humphrey Bogart as Philip Marlowe investigating a murder and a socialite's (Martha Vickers) involvement for her father (Charles Waldren). Her sister, played by Lauren Bacall, gets involved pretty deeply in the story too, which also features a quirky (redundant?) Elisha Cook Jr. performance. There's also a great scene between Bogart and Dorothy Malone in a bookstore. Directed by Howard Hawks with a William Faulkner script. Added to the National Film Registry in 1997. Bogart's Philip Marlowe is AFI's #32 hero.Part of the reason for the film's muddled plot is the fact that it was completed in 1944, and was then shelved due to Warner Bros.'s rush to get their backlog of war themed films out the door before they became dated, per the pending end of World War II. Subsequently, Hawks' earlier film with Bogie & Bacall, To Have and Have Not (1944), was released, which contained such great interplay between its two stars (who would fall in love and marry in real life), that Jack Warner decided to put this film back in production a year after primary photography had been completed. The script was spiced up and several scenes were cut and/or altered to make it even better than the original, which was never released but can be seen (if infrequently) on TCM along with a documentary detailing the changes.",

            "content": "Humphrey Bogart, one of the biggest movie stars of the 20th century was the one and only choice to play Philip Marlowe. The great thing about him was that he didn't seem like your typical heroic figure and that puts him right at home in the seedy environment of film noir where everybody seems kind of crooked, even the police.Though he played kind of heroic figures there was always a sinister quality to him and this is played out beautifully in this movie where he seems to be most comfortable with the villains rather than the more straight-laced characters.The plot of The Big Sleep is so complicated that you are often thinking that you are being put on. Names and events are hurled at you every 2 seconds so if you only watch this movie once you will be totally lost. The most complicated character belongs to Lauren Bacall's Vivian. Marlowe is in the dark about her role up until the last 20 minutes or so and therefore it was really unbelievable that the role is played so well by Bacall (this was only her second movie).The whole movie is quite good but a little bit slow for my taste. If you have seen The Maltese Falcon it was definitely the better of the two. Still, there are those priceless moments when Marlowe goes into the Geiger bookstore and is met with the absolute hilarious line by the clerk: \"What do they look like - grapefruits?\" The director, Howard Hawks, was certainly an actor's director and he gave some of the best roles to among others, John Wayne, Cary Grant, Gary Cooper and of course Bogie himself. This was as far as I can remember the last time that Bogie and Hawks worked together and I think that anything that they would have done afterwards could not live up to this, so maybe it was a good choice. Hawks would die a very old man and by the the 60's his inspiration had virtually dried out (he made Rio Bravo 3 times).Had Bogart lived longer he would probably be in spoof after spoof of his undying persona and it's a bit of a disappointment that he was not very successful at playing a different character. The part of Captain Queeg in \"The Caine Mutiny\" is absolutely terrific and so different from Marlowe. Although, in my opinion he is the essence of 40's movies cynicism, he should have been much more than that.",

It's an incredible experience for film lovers of all ages. Humphrey Bogart is Philip Marlowe, a private investigator called in to solve a blackmail case, and that's all you need to know because you just need to observe as Marlowe lurches from scene to scene, deeper and deeper into a convoluted mire that triumphs as each scene unfolds.One of the greatest detective films ever made, directed by a genius, starring another, and as dialogue goes it has few peers. 10/10",

            "content": "(Glad to see that following last night's TMC showing, IMDb at last lists Sonia Darrin's sharply etched \"Agnes\", the unfriendly sales girl, among the cast credits, after what had been an inexplicable omission.)Alan Silver and Elizabeth Ward's excellent source book \"Film Noir\" goes into some detail ferreting out the strictly noir elements of this otherwise compromised private eye melodrama. Understandably, their concern is with the movie's noirish subtext and not with the film itself. Still and all, much of noir's appeal lies in its dark forebodings about the basic nature of things. Thus, the subtext here may be worth ferreting out, but that hardly compensates, in my book at least, for the movie's overall failure to live up to standards of either a noir classic or even a movie classic, despite the fabled Bogart-Bacall-Hawks collaboration. Now, there's no need to dwell on the notoriously convoluted plot, except to insist that it really does undermine the end result. Most importantly, the general incoherence drains viewer interest because of mounting difficulty in maintaining the many threads. As a result, interest in a subtext, for example, is abandoned to hardy professionals not so concerned with whether the movie succeeds as a movie. Thus, it's the characters that must sustain audience interest. However, an unusually large, and at times confusing, supporting cast is required by the screenplay meanderings. That would be okay if the characters and their actors were consistently interesting. But they're not. The trouble is that except for the two leads no one else gets much screen time. Thus, genuinely interesting characters or actors such as the general (Waldron), Carmen (Vickers), Canino (Steele), and (Agnes) Darrin, get shuttled around by the pallid likes of Mars (a badly miscast Ridgely), Ohls (Toomey), and Brody (Heydt). In short, the screenplay is not only confusing, but over-crowded, as well. True, many of the one-liners are memorable, but no one seems in charge of what they add up to.Also, I think many folks are too much in thrall to the Bogart-Bacall-Hawks mystique to notice that this is not a triumph for any of the three. Bogart's Marlowe is basically a one-note character, who spouts snappy one-liners, sees through most every ploy, and proves irresistible to anything with long hair. To me, it gets quickly tiresome, Bogie or no Bogie. At the same time, nothing shows the movie's basic flaw better than the ruinously unnecessary afternoon dalliance between Marlowe and Acme girl Malone. Not only is it awkwardly handled (Hawks), but undercuts the credibility of the Marlowe character early on. Whatever Bogart's appeal, it's not that of a matin\u00e9e idol. Then there's Bacall. To her credit, she never claimed to be much of an actress. Instead, she's a presence. The trouble is that Vivian's devious nature calls for more nuance than Bacall can manage. Thus, her performance is reduced to dialogue without behavior, and an object lesson in what proves good for a career does not necessarily prove good for a movie, basic attractions or no basic attractions. Then too, I don't see much of trademark Hawks anywhere on screen. No overlapping dialogue or real snap. Looks to me like he was shackled by the screenplay and Warner's desire to employ a bevy of contract players. Then too, there's the question of final edit, which wouldn't be the first time a studio had botched a director's cut.I'm also puzzled by some of the sub-standard sets, especially the outdoor night scenes. The occasional fog serves not only as atmosphere but also masks the shabbily done backdrops. Given the name cast and director, it's surprising to me that these detractions would pass studio muster (or Hawks'). Now, none of this is to deny that the movie does have its moments. The first 15 minutes or so amounts to a gem of an opening act. The interplay between Marlowe and the mansion's assorted characters is cleverly conceived and executed. Also, there's enough boldness in the production to hint at such forbidden adult themes as drug addiction and nymphomania. As a result, Carmen Sternwood amounts to one of the most unusual characters of the Production Code 1940's, daringly brought to life by the under-rated and star-crossed Martha Vickers. Nonetheless, the sum total adds up to a disappointingly disjointed result, made more so by the caliber of the artists involved.",

In Fact, it is well Known that Martha Vickers, playing the Nympho, Drug Addict, Carmen Sternwood was so Good, She Dominated the Film and most of Her Scenes were Cut so Bacall would Not be Overlooked.Howard Hawks Stiff Style and overlapping Dialog is completely Unnecessary here because the Words themselves are so Witty and Snappy, Sarcastic and Humorous, that Hawks need Not Intrude with His bit of Clunk. A Howard Hawks Movie almost always Looks Studio Bound, Fake, and Staged. It is Evident by anyone Watching this Film-Noir, must Immediately Notice the Lack of Expressionism. The Movie was entirely Shot in a Studio and on Sound Stages and boy does it Show and the Gritty and Dark Meilu of Noir are only Evident a Few Times.But Despite Hawks and Bacall almost Sinking the Thing, the Film still manages to be Great.

Not the \"Inserted Scenes\" of Bacall jousting Innuendos with Bogart and Embarrassing Herself in the Casino Singing and making Silly Gestures. OK the Racehorse Scene at the restaurant is Remembered fondly but Not for Bacall but the, once again, Sexually Charged Dialog.There's plenty of Sexy Girls, a lot of Violence, and Code-Busting subtexts like Pornography, Homosexuality, a Teenage Sex and Drug Addict, that make this Film-Noir No Doubt.

The film is enhanced by the adaptation of William Faulkner, Leigh Brackett and Jules Furthman. The movie has an excellent look and the music score by Max Steiner enhances what we witness on the screen.The new director's cut shows a much tighter film, although both the studio release and Mr. Hawks' version are equally excellent. The film capitalizes in the interplay between Marlowe and Vivian. As portrayed by Humphrey Bogart and Lauren Bacall, this seems to be the main reason for watching the film. However, there are small details that render the film the brilliant piece it is.The dialog is intelligent and keeps us interested in what's going on. As Bob the Moo suggested in his commentary, it helps to keep pen and paper handy because the many sub plots will get anyone confused if no attention is paid to the proceedings we are witnessing. Also, this film seems to have gotten away with murder, no pun intended, by having been given an OK by the Hays group, because the way some things are said that convey another meaning. There is a homosexual undercurrent because of the figure of Geiger, who is obviously gay, but without mentioning the fact, or drawing undue attention to what's going on.The best thing in the film is Humphrey Bogart. He is a cool Marlowe who can unravel the mystery he is investigating. The gorgeous Lauren Bacall is just as good in her cool approach to Vivian. Not only is Ms. Bacall talented, but she casts a large presence on the movie.Howard Hawks' direction got excellent performances from the cast. Dorothy Malone's book store manager, emits so much heat, she smolders the screen! The nymphet Carmen Sternwood, hitting on Marlowe at one point, and high on drugs next, is interpreted by the sexy Martha Vickers showing she had promise. Charles Waldron, Elisha Cook Jr, Charles Brown add another layer to the film's texture.The film in any of the two versions prove to be a perennial favorite of fans of this genre thanks to Mr. Hawks' understanding of the material.",

I could tell right away from the first scene that this film was not to my liking as the young woman threw herself at Marlowe whom she just met. Later a bookseller and the other sister threw themselves at him as well. So I was not sure what the tone of this film was, was it a fatuous noir flick, or a more serious mystery one? I guess it tries to do both, but where are the cops -- they're never around. And where is the client, the old man who is in the first scene then disappears for the rest of the film? How does he feel about all of this?Why does Marlowe even care about any of these people, is it a sense of bringing people to justice, but then he never does that, he obstructs justice and obfuscates repeatedly. Is he in love with the \"good\" sister, which is laughable as she is as awful or worse than the other sister. Why is the plot so convoluted and confusing? There are too many characters involved and it is impossible to keep track of them all and their motivations. Why was the bookstore emptied out?

And, believe me, unintentional laughs it certainly did produce.Now 70 years old, The Big Sleep is filled to overflowing with plenty of wise-cracking dialogue, and cutie-pie bantering.... And, of course, Bogart's character was so ridiculously hardboiled and always just a little too sure of himself (regardless of any imminent danger) - And that all quickly added up to a truly comical romp down \"Nostalgia Lane\" for me.Anyways - Here in The Big Sleep, Humphrey Bogart plays (as only he could possibly play) character Philip Marlowe, a 25-dollar-a-day gumshoe who, agreeing to take on a cut'n'dry case of blackmail, inadvertently finds himself completely caught up in a very messy and tangled web of murder, treachery and, yes, romance that, believe me, gets screwier and screwier by the minute.I honestly can't imagine how any audience (even from the 1940s) could ever take The Big Sleep's story with dead-faced seriousness - 'Cause it's not.

By the end, you don't know really who did what and it was a relief to hear those police sirens as Bogie and Lauren embraced-you knew it was the end.This film noir faded to black all right! You really have to blame Raymond Chandler's writing for this colossal bomb.",

            "content": "The Big Sleep is one of the best known and distinctly archetypal examples of a style of movie-making we now call \"film noir\". It is also notoriously hard to follow, with a plot so and labyrinthine and subtly suggestive it leaves most viewers baffled. And yet it is immensely popular, was a commercial success in its day, and has long been praised as one of the all-time classics of the form. It must have some secret.The screenplay is adapted, very faithfully I must say, from the novel by Raymond Chandler. In a book, where it's possible to chew over a story point-by-point, such complexity is quite acceptable. But Chandler's story seems staggeringly unsuitable for the movies. For a start, the intrigue does not revolve around any tangible goal or object, like the titular bird in The Maltese Falcon, a similar but far simpler work. This means rather than watching out for who's hiding what, we have to pay attention to the relationships between the characters, none of whom has any obvious reasons for helping or hindering one another. The characters themselves are numerous, with more heavies, molls and dodgy businessmen than you can shake a pistol at. And while the dialogue is sparkling with quotable quips, whenever anyone gets onto the actual subject of the investigation, it suddenly turns into gobbledegook. Bogart's going over with Joe Brody over whoever may or may not have the photos of Carmen is a veritable tongue-twister. No wonder audiences then and now were confused.So what else does The Big Sleep have to its name? Well, most importantly it has its too leading stars, Humphrey Bogart and Lauren Bacall. Bogart and Bacall were built for noir styling. They both have a hard iciness to their personae, but with easygoing charisma and a knack for delivering smart dialogue with aplomb that makes them absolutely irresistible. And between them they have chemistry to boot. Even if you didn't know they were an offscreen couple, you would still think them destined for each other on screen. It was their first pairing a few years earlier that livened up the otherwise uninteresting To Have and Have Not, where they took a few classy lines of script and made the air crackle.Standing between this stellar pair and that convoluted plot is director Howard Hawks, and this is where things get really neat. Rather than try to elucidate the story, Hawks buries it even further. At any moment which deals with the finer details of the plot, Hawks dresses up the image with shadows, movement or really whatever clutter is available. In the opening scene at Sternwood's house, the gloomy, cavernous interiors show off the old-world austerity of the place. He then makes a bizarre jungle of Sternwood's greenhouse, with bits of plant invading the foreground like tentacles. All of this is part of the atmosphere, or more precisely the trappings of film noir, and Hawks lays it on thick to immerse us in the picture's world. However, Hawks was exceedingly good at bringing individuals out of the mosaic. In the first scene between Bogart and Bacall, all the other business fades away, the sets become light and bare, and suddenly we are just looking at two people. Compare this to the scene in which Bogart finds a drugged-up Martha Vickers at Geiger's house, where Hawks places her to blend in with the lavish decoration. She is effectively part of the scenery, not a focal point as Bacall is.The upshot of all this is, we don't end up feeling as if we've been told a story as such, but we do feel we've been given an experience. When Sternwood sets the scene to Bogart, we are unlikely to pick up all he says about Regan or Geiger, but we do remember the old man's mutterings about brandy and cigars. When Bacall comes to Bogart's office, we don't recall what she has to say, but their funny telephone conversation, where Bogart pretends Bacall is his mother and Bacall pretends Bogart is her father, sticks in our minds. By all means, try and fathom what's really going on \u2013 it's a rather fun intellectual exercise for repeated viewings \u2013 but the real point of The Big Sleep is to give us the very essence of hard-boiled fiction, of mean-faced hit men and double-crossing dames.

A rare book dealer, blackmail, murder, payoffs, a missing chauffeur, a missing wife - yikes! The story is so convoluted that the script writers had to call Raymond Chandler, on whose novel the film is based, to ask him who killed a particular character. Chandler says it's in the book, but the writers couldn't find it. So in the general release film, we're left not knowing, although the cut shown to serviceman does resolve the question. But somehow, it doesn't matter because of the casting.Humphrey Bogart is terrific as Sam Spade, absolute perfection. He mines the humor in the character as well as the drama. Lauren Bacall is drop-dead gorgeous and sexy as Vivian Rutledge, and her chemistry with Bogart is va-va-va-voom. Their dialogue, with those sexy innuendos and undertones, is one of the delights of this film, particularly when they're discussing horse racing. Mrs. Rutledge feels it all depends on \"who's in the saddle.\" Fabulous. That scene and several others were added much later to benefit Bacall's character; Warners and her agent were afraid more bad reviews like she received in Confidential Agent would ruin her. (The fact that she was miscast in Confidential Agent seems to have escaped everyone.) According to Raymond Chandler, Martha Vickers overshadowed Bacall, so lots of her footage was cut.Bogart and Bacall made several films together, but I think this is their best. Bacall, admittedly nervous in \"To Have and Have Not,\" though it didn't show, is supremely confident in this and gives as good as she gets.I just followed the story and attempted to keep track of it, all the while enjoying the repartee between these two. I usually don't think of Bogart as sexy, but he sure was here. Goes to show you what love can do.",

Hawks knows the story is way overcomplicated - at one point in the writing of the script, Brackett and Faulkner realized they couldn't tell who killed the guy who was found in the car in the bay; they telephoned novelist Chandler, who, after a long pause for thought, admitted that he didn't know either! (The novel's worth - as with most of Chandler's best - derives from his ability to write paragraphs like poetry.) But Hawks was a director in love with challenges like this one; so he turned the whole film into an exercise in mood and character. Could the mood make the characters come alive? Could the actors take this opportunity to drive the plot despite the lapses and complications? Obviously, my answer is a strong \"yes!\" As a viewer, I become immersed in this other world that is so predominately night, and in learning all I can about these characters.

Although I fully enjoyed the films back then; I expected to more fully comprehend them when I was older. Now, I am older, and, while I still enjoy films like \"The Big Sleep\", I do not expect there will ever be any way to understand the storyline of this one. Mr. Bogart is detective Philip Marlowe, hired by older General Sternwood (Charles Waldron) to solve an increasingly complicated crime. The aptly named Sternwood has two sexually charged daughters: Lauren Bacall (as Vivian) and Martha Vickers (as Carmen). And, check out young Dorothy Malone as a bookstore clerk.The pairing of Bogart and Ms Bacall is terrific; and, Ms. Vickers is no slouch, either. One of the best scenes involves Bacall unsuccessfully trying to ignore an itch under her dress; finally, Bogart invites her to scratch away. Such scenes have a great sexual energy, and innuendo. Although the story, as a whole, is too vague, the script is exceptional. It's full of wit. Raymond Chandler (original novelist), Leigh Brackett, William Faulkner, and Jules Furthman have written exceptional conversational dialogue. And, the film has a wonderful look; it's directed, with great style, by Howard Hawks. His Bogart/Bacall scenes are very entertaining, and the action sequences exciting; especially notable is the confrontation between Bogart and \"Lundgren\" (Tommy Rafferty). ******** The Big Sleep (8/23/46) Howard Hawks ~ Humphrey Bogart, Lauren Bacall, Martha Vickers",

Bogart, encapsulates Marlowe perfectly, and Bacall who plays Vivian Reagan is able to bring out a convincing performance. The rapid scenes and sudden actions by each character do not really leave any time to process what just happened. The movie does have an incredible score and sound effects, such as the gun shots. But, I was really not able to understand what was happening. Although the cast gives an incredible performance, I really could not understand all the points of the story.

I know I'm breaking my 'law' that a good plot is vital to a good film, but 'The Big Sleep' is an exception to the rule. It doesn't seem to need a strong storyline, and it's classic status has endured without one. Chandler couldn't even explain many of the events in his novel, so how could the film be expected to?It is Martha Vickers that almost steals this movie, though. As the nymphomaniac, perpetually drugged-up Carmen Sternwood, younger sister to Bacall's Vivien, she is simply fantastic. Apparently many of her scenes were cut (!) because she was stealing the film from right under leading lady Lauren Bacall's nose.

Humphrey Bogart tries hard in the role of Philip Marlower, though he is not ideal for the part; and others such as John Ridgeley, Frank Puglia, very young Lauren Bacall and Dorothy Malone do very well indeed. Other parts are less-well realized. But what the viewer sees here is a convoluted storyline that is made to work technically and artistically by Howard Hawks, the skilled director, and by a more-than-attractive production made in glowing B/W, featuring a large number of well-mounted scenes. The original novel by Raymond Chandler was a pasting together of plot elements drawn from very fine earlier short stories; it is to be regretted that he did not later rewrite this early attempt which is quite unsatisfying compared to his later works. But the promising storyline was taken up by the screenwriters and made into a very memorable set of ethically contexted characters, the actions they feel compelled to take and their reactions to the consequences of those actions. The film has a lot of very famous tough and terse dialogue of course; but the dialogue is always used to move the slender plot-mystery along. The art direction and cinematography are unusually good in most places; many minor parts are played very well, by Elisha Cook Jr., Trevor Bardette, Charles D. Brown and others. Blocking of difficult-to-stage scenes is very good, such as a large nightclub-gambling joint, the action climax at a country house and the opening in General Sternwood's nicely-considered home where p.i. Marlowe first meets his potential client (Charles Waldon)and his two unruly daughters (particularly Bacall). One of the best elements of this bright film is the way pairs of persons play with one another and off a third person; perhaps no one can follow the storyline exactly, but there is hardly a dull second in this importantly-well-made adventure noir entry. No wonder this is the most copied of all early noir films, and one that in its own metier has never been equaled. We never miss a chance to enjoy this ground-breaking achievement.",

Marlowe traces the blackmailer, Arthur Geiger, to his house, only to find that Geiger has been shot dead. Any further explanation of the plot would be difficult; from this point onwards it becomes very complex, with a large cast of characters being introduced and several more murders being committed, as Marlowe uncovers a web of corruption and violent crime. The plot is not only extraordinarily complicated, it is also confusing, containing threads that are never developed and events that are never explained. It is said that even the scriptwriter, the well-known novelist William Faulkner, did not know who committed one of the murders, nor the motive for which it was committed, and that Raymond Chandler, the author of the original novel on which the film was based, proved to be no more helpful. (Is it significant that the leading character has the same surname as the Elizabethan dramatist known for his complex and gruesome plots?)This is not, however, the sort of movie one watches primarily for the plot. Anyone who watches it expecting it to be an Agatha Christie type 'whodunit', with all the crimes solved and all loose ends neatly tidied up in the final scene is likely to be disappointed. What makes the film so watchable is its atmosphere. A dark, menacing feeling was a hallmark of the 'film noir' style, but in 'The Big Sleep' it is particularly strong. In keeping with the dark deeds that make up its plot, much of the action takes place either at night or against a background of torrential rain. Combined with this is an air of dubious glamour. There are numerous strikingly beautiful but sinister women among the cast, some of them only playing minor roles. The best-known of these is, of course, Lauren Bacall as Carmen's older sister Vivian (who provides Marlowe's love-interest), but there are also Martha Vickers as Carmen herself, Dorothy Malone, Peggy Knudsen, Sonia Darrin and Joy Barlow. (Joy Barlow? She is the angelic-looking brunette who plays the female tax-driver who appears in one brief scene. She had bit-parts in fourteen films in the 1940s, only being credited on one of them. Even in Hollywood, looks are not always enough to guarantee success). One might have expected the late forties, following the return of peace after the victorious conclusion to the Second World War, would have been a time of optimism in America, but this mood was not always reflected in the films of the era. This was the heyday of film noir, the most pessimistic of genres. As well as being physically dark, 'The Big Sleep' is also morally dark. The mood is one of cynicism and world-weariness, mostly emanating from Humphrey Bogart's interpretation of the lead character. This was the sort of part in which Bogart excelled; apart from 'Casablanca' (in which he played another type of cynic), he is probably best-remembered today for his film noir roles, especially the hard-bitten private eyes he played here and in 'The Maltese Falcon'. There is, of course, frequently a more human side beneath the surface Bogart cynicism; Rick in 'Casablanca' ends up 'doing the decent thing', and Marlowe, for all his cynical wit, has a genuine desire to see justice done. Bogart gave so many great performances in the course of his career that it would be difficult to single one out as being his best, but 'The Big Sleep' must come high on the list. Lauren Bacall, Bogart's real-life wife, is also excellent in this film, and there is a genuine sexual tension in the scenes between them. It is interesting that the film was completely overlooked by the Academy; it did not receive a single Oscar nomination. Like a number of other classic films noirs it seems to be more highly regarded now than when it was made. Despite the insane complexity of its plot, this is a film that never fails to hold the attention, and still has the power to fascinate nearly sixty years on. 8/10",

The 6th time Bogart drives to Geigers cottage you may be crying, \"Enough!\" but this plot just keeps going and going...I had been warned that this one was quite elaborate and it is. Something like seven people are dead and I still can't tell you why. The only noir where I lost interest in the plot quicker, was Murder My Sweet which was just as elaborately silly. Can't each cadaver have a walk-on before they're killed. (Owen Taylor and Sean Regan) I tend to confuse stiffs I've never seen. If it must be this complicated, couldn't the writers make the narrative/crime so compelling that a viewer is drawn in? How can a viewer care about a solution when they haven't seen (and haven't been made to care about) a crime that occurred before the movie even started?I accidentally viewed the wrong side of my double sided DVD and preferred the 1944 version to the one that audiences loved in 1946. I see very negligible differences in the two versions that saved it from Bacall's supposedly poor performance. Seems like the sexually-charged racehorse dialog needed inclusion because without it, the most emotionally involved Bogart gets with anyone is with the rare books girl. Without it, Bacall just simmers for the whole movie.The thing I find strange about noir is that even the most pricey production feels like it was shot on the cheap. Here, two or three major characters never appear, but are talked about and credited with driving the whole plot. Central characters are never visualized; to save money... or to allow the plot to be more complicated? Also cheap, but effective is that night looks a bit more like night in Bogart's movies because they skip the expensive exterior day-for-night shoots, which I never find convincing and always find distracting.

Carman has gotten herself into debt at what later turned out to be Eddie Mars gambling den and was being blackmailed by one of Mars tenant, in a house that he rented him, rare book-shop owner Arthur Geiger.Marlow checking out Geiger's place is shocked to hear this woman screaming and when he breaks in he finds Geiger shot dead and Carman in a state hysteria unable to talk as Geiger's killer, or killers, take off in two different automobiles. Finding Geiger's little black book with names of those whom, like Carman and her father Gen. Sternwood, he's blackmailing Marlow deduces that he may well have been murdered by one of the persons in that book. Marlow also notices that there's a hidden camera with the film missing and with Carmen scantily dressed it didn't take long for Marlow to realize that she was, with almost no clothes on, the one who was photographed.It's then that Marlow takes Carman back home and tells her older sister the former Mrs. Vivian Rutledge Sternwood to tell the police if they show up that she was at home the entire evening. This is Marlows way of keeping Carman from being suspected in Geigers murder. It's later when the Sternwood chauffeur Owen Taylor, whom Marlow finds out murdered Geiger,is found dead with a broken neck at the bottom of Lido Pier that things start to go a bit too fast in the movie and makes it almost impossible to figure just what Carmans real problems are. It turns out that Carmans troubles have really nothing to do with either being blackmailed for not paying off her gambling debts or being photographed in the nude; they have a lot to do with something far more serious murder.Dspite all the killings in the film, I counted seven of them,the one most on Gen. Sternwood's mind was that of his former employee Sean Regan. It's not until much later in the film that you begin to realize that it was Regan whom Gen. Sternwood was really interested in finding and using his young and somewhat unstable daughter Carman as a cover in having Marlow find him, dead or alive. Regan had become somewhat of a son to the old man and his sudden disappearance had deeply affected him. Gen. Sternwood was positive that Regan didn't just leave on his own but that something terrible happened to him and he also suspected Carman to have been the person who was responsible for it.Meanwhile Marlow is totally clueless to what's really on Gen. Sternwood's mind which the general did everything to throw Marlow off in having him find Regan by making it look like he was trying to uncover who was blackmailing him over his daughter Carman. During the film Marlow gets involved in a number of murders as well as having himself badly worked over by Mars hoods as well as falling in love with Gen. Sternwood's older daughter Vivian. Vivian herself knows that her younger sister was somehow involved in Regan's disappearance and you start to wonder if her relationship with Marlow was really on the up and up or she was only using him to get the cops from suspecting Carman in Regan's disappearance or even murder!The movie or Philip Marlow has non other then Eddie Mars get set up for Regan's murder in his already having been responsible for at least two others that of Owen Taylor and little Harry Jones as well as trying to have his hoods knock off Philip Marlow himself. Marlow with Vivian, who for a time was working with Mars, have Mars show up at the late Arthur Geigers place and trick him into having his boys outside think that Marlow was the first one to first step out the door. Firing at Mars and wounding him Marlow has him run for his life outside where his hoods, mistaking him for Marlow, blast him to pieces with the police who were alerted by Marlow, by phone from inside the house, coming on the scene to arrest them.With the dead Mars now being framed in Regan's, his body had since been found, murder Marlow with both Vivian's and Gen. Sternwood's help have Carman sent away to a mental institution where she can get help and at the same time not end up behind bars for Sean Regan's murder. The truth is that Carman not Eddie Mars was responsible for Regan's murder when he left her for Eddie's wife Mora which drove the very mentally and emotionally unstable Carman to go off the deep end and murder him.P.S The remake of \"The Big Sleep\" in 1978 with Robert Mitchum playing Philip Marlow had a lot more cohesive plot and didn't confuse those watching the movie like the 1946 version did. Even though the 1978 version covered the same ground as the original it stuck to the story and didn't hit you with side-plot after side-plot that by the time the movie was finally over you had no idea what you were watching for the last two or so hours on the screen.",

There is so much talking and exposition, so many character names to keep track of, and the story just didn't impress me all that much. The \"plot twist\" that are critical to any good crime mystery, just aren't that surprising and the film doesn't really feel like it builds to any kind of climax that I found myself caring out.There are some good performances in this film, but it is not something that I would want to watch again any time soon. I was bored through most of it, and I was having to work hard the whole time to pay attention to all the little details, trying to keep all the characters straight, hoping that it would pay off with some amazing ending, but that never really came. I think a lot of these old movies have very generous score on IMDb and this is one of them. Maybe it has a lot to do with nostalgia, or the importance of this film at the time it was made.Either way, if you are looking for an exciting crime murder mystery, I would look elsewhere. If you are into classic film noir movies, or a big fan of Bogart, then maybe this is the film for you.",

Who can fault the director, stars, author, or screenplay? All were top drawer in their field. Granted, the story is confusing with so many characters and sub-plots that you need a diagram to follow who is doing what to whom. And certainly violent enough......did you notice that Marlowe shoots Canino not once, but three times....and how about when he pushes Eddie Mars out the door to be shot down by his own men. No talking or beating around the bush here! How much more can be said about Bogart and Bacall?....to this day, their presence still evokes passion in their fans, me included. But there are a some other players in this film worth mentioning. Bob Steele, as Canino, is so perfect for the role of Mars' henchman,..he is truly evil and Steele plays it to a T. It is also strange to see John Ridgley playing a bad guy; he was usually the bland sidekick and his role as Eddie Mars is against type. It works. Elisha Cook Jr. is spot on as the pathetic \"little man\" Jonesy. And Dorothy Malone comes across (in more ways than one it appears)in her small part as the book store clerk, glasses and all. My favorite line from the film comes from Martha Vickers when she first meets Marlowe and says, \"You're not very tall are you?\".......Marlowe's reply,\"I try to be.\" If you like fast moving, hard bitten films with great black and white cinematography, this is the ticket.

One day, he gets hired by an old man to investigate a case. Of course, he's about to get a lot more than he bargained for. Throughout the whole movie, you can feel the tension between the various characters, and you wonder who's hiding what. It goes to show that Bogie and Lauren Bacall were truly a great team.Oh, and by the way, I noticed that in one scene, Marlowe enters Acme Bookstore. Maybe that was just the name, but maybe there was more to it than that. I try to imagine Wile E. Coyote ordering from them some wacky device to try and trap Road Runner (only to fail, natch).

But, unlike a movie that is \"very good\" or \"excellent,\" it runs out of steam well before its climax. It is a well-made film, that is for certain--director Howard Hawks choreographs every scene with fluid blocking and hard-boiled dialog that eventually becomes self-parodic. Adapted from a novel by Raymond Chandler, \"The Big Sleep\" is not the \"masterpiece\" that many claim--for comparative purposes, such neo-Noir as \"Chinatown\" (1974) and \"L.A. Confidential\" (1997) interweave many characters and plot threads more coherently, while still leaving enough ambiguity to warrant repeat viewings. \"The Big Sleep\" begins with a plot setup that will bob and weave freely over its two hours: a millionaire is being blackmailed, and private eye Philip Marlowe (Humphrey Bogart) is called in to get to the bottom of it. To watch the movie is to be in a state of utter confusion (indeed, even Chandler couldn't follow it), and even as I took notes, I still came up with a fair amount of unresolved loose ends. And the double-crosses and dead bodies that surface in the narrative become increasingly hard to care about, since the characters exist as types rather than fleshed-out individuals. Ultimately, the best reasons to watch \"The Big Sleep\" have nothing to do with the plot--Bogart is well-cast as the quick-witted Marlowe, and Lauren Bacall (who was married to Bogart at the time) makes a fitting--albeit ice-cold--femme fatale, and Hawks skillfully directs a screenplay that seems confusing for its own sake. The film is not bad, but it could have been a whole lot better.",

Soon the detective is in over his head with the older sister (Lauren Bacall) who might know more than she's telling. It's hard to believe that one of the greatest films of the decade also has what is perhaps the worst story. I believe this was my third time watching this and the story doesn't make any more sense now than it did the first couple of times I watched it. It's rather amazing at how highly thought of this film is even with its lack of a coherent story to follow. You'd really think a weak plot would lead to a weak film but that's far from the case because this here is certainly a pure classic of the genre. What works so well are the incredible performances mixed with the strong direction. Bogart is once again playing a cool but tough detective and God knows no one was ever better than he was. I often wonder if Bogart got a kick out of practicing his various walks for these types of films because he certainly nails it each time he walks into a room to knock out a bad guy or just flirt with a woman. His calm and cool nature really makes for a great leading man and he makes the role his own. Bacall also turns in another winning performance but it's Martha Vickers as her younger sister who really steals the show. John Ridgely, Dorothy Malone and Regis Toomey add great support as well. If you discuss this film the rather strange plot often gets talked about but I think the reason people overlook this is because the heart of the film isn't with solving the case but with the fun behind trying to solve it. The end result really doesn't matter because the viewer, as well as the characters, are having fun going through all the trouble of trying to come up with clues, villains and the reasons behind everything. A lot of the credit for this certainly goes to Hawks whose direction is solid and never wavers any of his style or vision.",

            "content": "(A Little Spoilers Included)For readers of Raymond Chandler, to enjoy this noir adaptation, the first hurdle to conquer may be to forget Philip Marlowe in Chandler's novels and to accept Marlowe performed by Humphrey Bogart. Chandler portrays Marlowe as a private eye with professional ethics and pride, not a womanizer like Bogart Marlowe, who falls for a daughter of his client. In addition, even understanding the values in the 40s, it is hard to believe that Bogart Marlowe can easily attract many women.The original story is too complicated to be adapted to a film; as a result, the plot highly relies on explanatory dialogues and is difficult to follow. For example, the viewers come to know that someone is tailing Marlowe when he asks Eddie Mars (John Ridgely) if Mars has someone follow him; this information should be given by a picture. The conclusion is abrupt; Marlowe figures out what happened to missing Shaun Regan completely out of the blue (He does so in the original novel, too, but the abruptness is less).Aside from these problems, the film is a well-stylized enjoyable noir piece. As a prototypical femme fatale, Vivian Sternwood (Lauren Bacall) appears everywhere as if she was a criminal mastermind behind the scene, and develops a romance with Marlowe, while in the novel she does neither of them. These factors make the plot less convincing, but enhance the noir aesthetics. Mars' wife Mona (Peggy Knudsen) looks too plain as a mysterious woman in villains' den; the 1945 prerelease version has a more suitable actress (Pat Clark). The stunning last shot of Bogart and Bacall smoking represents what the film is all about.",

Who would have thought that a short, slight man with a lisp and the name `Humphrey' could become such a sex symbol? The Big Sleep sees him playing a private eye, a role revisited  from five years earlier in The Maltese Falcon (Different dicks though \u0096 there he's Sam Spade, here he's Philip Marlowe). Falcon is a fantastic film with a celebration of noir. The Big Sleep is perhaps overshot (huge shadows fall over supporting players as the principles are backlit to extreme) and deals more with domesticity. Flowery wallpaper, ornate vases and delicate curtains adorn this lighter work.\nFalcon also saw a greater variety of characters, including Peter Lorre as the camp Joel Cairo, twiddling away with his umbrella.  The Big Sleep is largely composed of women, all of whom seem to find Bogart irresistible. Even the taxi driver is a beautiful brunette. As a result, it's someway the weaker of the two films, it's enforced melodrama and overdone incidental music dating it considerably. Perhaps the biggest weakness is the interplay between Bogart and Bacall. His real-life wife, any build-up of sexual tension between the two would have dissipated, thereby killing any on-screen chemistry. Many cite their relationship as one of the film's major strengths, but to my eyes, even the raciest of dialogue exchanges (such as the part where Bacall describes being ridden like a horse) lack that vital spark.What makes it though is the classy lines, if not the complex plot. There's Charles Waldron as Bacall's father, who encourages Bogart to smoke and laments having to indulge his vices `by proxy'. Or Humphrey snapping to Bacall: `Take it easy. I don't slap so good around this time of the evening'. Maybe it's just the way he tells \u0091em. The film takes us back to a time when murder was committed bloodlessly, and for the most romantic of reasons. Cars were big, hats were bigger.

            "content": "\"The Big Sleep\" is one of those famous film noirs you always hear about, which has helped redefine (or even revolutionize) the entire genre. It stars Humphrey Bogart as famous screen detective Philip Marlowe, summoned by a dying General to investigate several problems related to the dying man's family.As Marlowe searches deeper he finds each issue involves the disappearance of an employee who has left town with a mobster's wife. Secrets are unturned, revelations made known...and so on and so forth.Howard Hawks was a great, great director and that really shows through here - more so than anything else. This film stands the test of time incredibly well. For a film from 1946, you'd hardly guess it isn't a modern one. The way the material is handed is something I'd never expect from a film from the 1940s.The performances are great. Bogart creates one of cinema's most endearing characters as Marlowe, the private eye with a lot on his mind. Bacall is a suitable (if not particularly captivating) love interest.The movie is well-written, well-directed and well-acted. Seen almost sixty years later, it's still a great film noir - and one of the best of its genre.",

            "content": "When you watch \"The Big Sleep\", you'd better take notes. Its plot is as confusing as \"The Maltese Falcon\".As a story, it is flawed. This is partly due to divergences from the original book by Raymond Chandler. It is very much due to changes in the story made because of Hayes Code considerations. Too many plot points are hidden by insinuation or implication. Finally, the film was re-edited after completion, to emphasize the Bogart-Bacall relationship.However, like \"The Maltese Falcon\", this film is generally heralded as a great example of noir. That's because style is more important than substance. What are these style elements that make the film an artistic success? Firstly, you have the dialogue, especially the dialogue that comes from the lips of Bogart, a real smooth operator who admits he likes games. Bacall's lines (enhanced by the refilming of certain scenes) are playful but, more importantly, they are delivered with her insolent-yet-interested style.There are plenty of night scenes. Most of Marlowe's work--like the best noir scenes--takes place after dark, in the shadows. And he frequents venues where persons of dubious nature dwell.Marlowe is a man with a moral compass operating in a sinister world. He is driven more by his own interest than by the law or a paycheck. That personality trait, more than anything else, makes the film interesting. The mystery that engages the viewer is not a whodunit. It is understanding the story that Marlowe is writing in his head, fueled by his understanding of human nature and the criminal element.So, the plot's obfuscations are more than compensated for by the film's style and the Marlowe character.",

I first saw this as a youngster on UK BBC2 Christmas Day 1977 and it blew me away; at 18 I thought how something so apparently ancient and hackneyed could be so engrossing and powerful? It led me on to some highs: reading the complete works of Raymond Chandler \u2013 decades ago I actually held an original Black Mask in my hands but unfortunately not even a fraction of the asking price as well; and lows: watching the abysmal 1978 movie remake. Humphrey Bogart & Lauren Bacall under the Warner Bros arc-lights were a marvellous addition to Chandler's world, even if Chandler's world was somewhat toned down by Hollywood. Michael Winner was not a desirable addition at all, and as usual a Loser.Fiendishly complex tale condensed and mashed up from two short stories has youngest daughter of a rich old man being blackmailed for porn pictures taken of her when high on drugs, while the elder daughter is ravelled up with a rather vicious hood and his henchmen. Bogart as Phillip Marlow (and cute Doghouse Riley) Private Detective comes in promising to clear up the mess by getting the blackmailer off the rich old man's back \u2013 or was it to find the rich old man's missing friend Shaun Regan instead? All the set pieces roll by: General Sternwood's sauna, all the confusing visits to Geiger's quaint house, the Ben-Hur episodes. And Bogie and his sexy pal Malone in the ACME Book Shop \u2013 on the strength of this I even got a first edition of The Wire Cutters by M E M Davis which if you notice was momentarily on display at the end of the section \u2013 but not at the start, and also the Dumas offer near the shop doorway was apparently over and done with at the climax of those few beautiful minutes. Some nice time spent with their funny senses of humour in Joe Brody's flat led to a loud murder and chase; fun and games at Eddie Mars' joint; while acidic Agnes' new friend little Harry chokingly finding nothing funny at all is imho one of Cinema's most poignant moments ever. Canino was a baddie you'd surely feel too scared to hiss at. The music from Max Steiner and the production from Howard Hawks were something to applaud though, the brooding electric atmosphere brilliantly captured onto nitrate black and white.There's two versions of the film available: the first version I saw was the 1945, it was always available \u2013 was I confused years later seeing the 1946 Bacall remix the first time without realising it! I wish my VHS copy of the TCM-UCLA recording from the '90's hadn't bit the dust as it was invaluable in listing and dryly explaining all the big and little differences.As with the question posed in Kane, what does it all add up to? There's so much happening it's legendary confusion is not surprising. A seamy Los Angeles was only envisaged from various Warners sound stages, however Shakespeare could realistically tell stories from around the world from only one stage. But surely Time has already proved this was a masterpiece, and in many people's opinions still one of the best motion pictures ever made. It's one of my top 5 favourite films of all time watched umpteen times over the decades, nowhere near perfect but an utterly superb poetic potboiler recommended in spite of a rather large body count and because of a rather large entertainment count.",

            "content": "The Big Sleep offers a plot line that's impossible to follow in some instances. That doesn't matter because the ragged plot still keeps you interested because it moves along so swiftly. The story is: Wealthy old Guy Sternwood is too debilitated to monitor his two wild daughters' vices, so hires a Private Investigator Phillip Marlowe, played by Bogart, to get rid of a blackmailer named Geiger. Geiger presents promissory notes signed by younger daughter Carmen for \"gambling debts.\" Marlowe learns that Geiger is an ACDC sexual athlete who earns his living renting out porn books, as well as making his own dirty photos at home. Geiger photographs bored & degenerate rich kids as porn models (e.g., Carmen Sternwood) and then charges them big bucks for the honor of appearing in his books. Geiger's blackmail tool is the notes Carmen signed for being made into a porn queen, not for gambling losses. Before Marlowe can confront Geiger, Geiger's murdered by Sternwood family chauffeur Owen Taylor, lover of Carmen. Taylor runs for it. Marlowe is almost an eye-witness to Geiger murder, but Carmen is in murder-room also, drunk & drugged so Marlowe spirits her home for her protection. Investigating Geiger's lending-library next day, Marlowe finds two employees cleaning out the books under direction of petty mug Joe Brody. Taylor's found murdered inside Sternwood limousine. Brody has photo stolen from Taylor who stole it from Geiger's house showing Carmen in murder-room & tries to blackmail Carmen's sister Vivien with it. Marlowe confronts Brody & Vivien, confiscating photo from Brody. While at Brody house, Marlowe & Vivien see Brody shot to death by Lundgren, Geiger's former employee /gay lover. Marlowe captures Lundgren, turning him in to cops after beating clues out of him. We learn Vivien has gambling problems and owes money & favors to Eddie Mars, big-time hood & entrepreneur. Mars gets rough with Marlowe but later plays nice, all for unknown reasons. Vivien tries to \"sugar Marlowe off\" with big payment. Marlowe keeps his hand in the mess and gets beaten by two Mars goons. Enter little Harry Jones, small-time outlaw. Jones promises Marlowe can get critical data on Geiger, Mars, Sternwood, etc from his girl- friend for $200. Girlfriend actually former Geiger librarian, former Brody gun-moll Agnes Lozier. Before Jones can deliver goods on the caper, he's murdered by super-thug Lash Canino. Again, Marlowe is almost eyewitness to murder. Agnes sells her info to Marlowe but doesn't grieve over Jones' death...Marlowe learns Mars' wife Mona hiding in farmhouse out of L.A. for unclear reasons. Marlowe cases farmhouse and sticks head in noose provided by Mars thug Canino. Vivien at farmhouse with Mona, but reasons unclear. Vivien helps Marlowe escape and kill Canino. Marlowe drives Vivien to Geiger's house to confront vengeful Mars but tricks Mars into arriving late. Mars' own men murder him by accident, Marlowe summons police. End.What a convoluted story to pack into 117 minutes! The film is helped to 5-star status by screen-idol good-hearted tough-guy Humphrey Bogart playing Marlowe and cool subtle sexy Lauren Bacall doing Vivien's part. There's not an actor miscast in any supporting role. If atmosphere can also be considered a supporting role, this movie has it. Even So Cal daytime scenes are filmed in a noir manner. People smoked furiously in movies then, and lingering tobacco smoke helps give The Big Sleep even more atmosphere, as does well-placed rainstorms and overgrown foliage. Sternwood butler Norris is an ominous presence in that he knows all about the family closeted skeletons. Norris will never spill the beans but his demeanor throughout suggests deeper darker secrets exist within the mansion than even this plot will expose.Even with so many dark and pointless lives revealed to us, this movie is funny and even lighthearted. Comic relief here covers over a bit Marlowe's innate dislike of the filthy rich, sexual vice, addictions, official corruption, bad business ethics, popular culture, psychiatry, quack religions, poor parenting, and the criminal classes. Raymond Chandler was an old-fashioned moralist who wrote message-stories using a popular genre of the day: tough-guy detective novels. His books written a good 60 years ago are all amazing indictments of what's corrupt and nasty in 2006 - gangsters with control-lines into City Hall, teenagers who carry contraceptives in their purses, film-culture that makes society more and more preoccupied with sexual sin, and honest cops getting beaten down by bigger and smarter waves of sleazy government, adults who'll do anything for a dollar when the quick dollar is best made by corrupting the youth of western society.",

Great suspense and star chemistry, blistering dialogue (largely thanks to the master, Leigh Brackett) and a violent, pessimistic view of the world make this one of the best of its type.  Very stylistic (as opposed to realist) direction and tone.  The story doesn't make too much sense (in its initial release version), but that's OK, too.  DVD now allows us to see both versions of the film on one disc -- thank heavens for good technology! \nHawks claims that in order to lower Bacall's voice to a suitable tone, he asked her to drive her car to the top of one of Hollywood's adjoining canyons and scream at the top of her lungs every night.  Looks like it paid off, because her husky delivery is even more effective here than in her previous film with Bogey and Hawks.  She shows a lot more chops than in her efforts without that very masculine pair.  As for Bogart, he carrier Chandler's classic antihero with dignity and panache, playing (as usual) the straight man to a set of unnerving circumstances and situations.  For a small guy, he can definately carry off the tough act.  Here he's created one of the silver screen's most unforgettable tough guy portrayals, not again equalled until perhaps Clint Eastwood's turn in \"Fistful of Dollars.\"",

            "content": "The Big Sleep is a comfortable movie to watch for the airy, pop culture-related intentions in the film-making. It was made to showcase Bogie and Bacall together, not to tell Raymond Chandler's intricate detective yarn, even if that's the way things may have started out. Actually, it started out the way most commercial films start out nowadays as well: It was an attempt at repeating the success of a previous film with the same stars. When the studio is focusing on a worry involving the comparison between the height of the male star and the women in the film and have him where shoes that make him taller, when the famous hole in the plot concerning an all-too-ambiguous death that Chandler himself couldn't figure out in his novel's adaptation, and when the majority of Martha Vickers's performance is cut because she has more intensity than the more profitable actress in the film, we're not talking about the celebration of cinematic art. We're talking about making ch-chings.I'm not saying The Big Sleep is a bad movie, because it isn't. It's just an early example of the transformation in film from art to commercialism and the rare wedding of both. Ask most big fans of this movie if they really follow the story. It's such a complex one, not to mention how much it was adjusted for the bankable advantages of having more of Bogart and Bacall on screen than they otherwise would've been. Here's a general description of the gist of the plot: Humphrey Bogart's character, down-to-earth private investigator Philip Marlowe, is sent for by General Sternwood, a rich war veteran who is dying from complications of organs that are growing weaker with his old age. Marlowe is asked to deal with blackmail concerning the General's youngest daughter, Carmen. Marlowe finds that the problem centers about the disappearance of Sternwood's favorite employee who has left with a mobster's wife. Marlowe soon finds himself falling in love with Sternwood's oldest daughter, Vivien, who initially takes a deep dislike to Mr Marlowe. As things unravel, the body count increases to cover the villain's tracks.See, now doesn't that sound good? Like a good little detective thriller? What the studio did to malleate it for an ensured profitability is not necessarily a bad thing, especially in comparison to what studios do for the same reasons nowadays, but why not let a movie be what it is? Nonetheless, it's a classic, and it's very good. Great cast, beautiful women, wonderfully earthy dialogue.",

Yet I'm more of a \"Big Sleep\" kind of guy; I like a nice hero.  Marlowe is a little shady and grumpy, perhaps, but he means well.  He even gets a very human moment of fear when his hand shakes during the final confrontation.  Unlike Sam Spade, he's not a mystery to the audience, but an open-book type whom you can root for with a clearer conscience.  This film is more \"Hollywoodized\" and accessible than \"The Maltese Falcon\" in several other respects.  Sexy babes abound here; every few seconds, another gorgeous woman pops out of the woodwork.  The pacing is much faster than \"Falcon,\" and while that helps sustain interest, it also means that certain plot elements are glossed over and obscured.  And yet, I still prefer the style of \"The Big Sleep.\"  I don't necessarily need realism or grimness to carry a detective story; in fact, this film's glib and sexy tone is more in keeping with my image of the genre than \"The Maltese Falcon.\"  At the end of the day, this film is simply faster and more fun, and I can relate to the protagonist more closely.   So, my somewhat flippant summary line actually disguises a deep admiration for this film!  This is about as much fun as you can have with a hoary old classic.  By the way, for my money, the theatrical cut is better than the original (boring) version.  Even with the D.A. scene added, the plot is still confusing, so I'll take a faster pace and some extra flirting instead.",

            "content": "The Big Sleep's plot may get frustratingly incomprehensible at times with a myriad of sub plots and suspects but Howard Hawks brisk direction, William Faulkner and Leigh Brackett's crisp dialog from Raymond Chandler's classic pulp and Humphrey Bogart's unflappable cool make getting lost a lot of fun in what is arguably the apogee of the American detective film. Convoluted as the script is we get to shadow Bogart's Philip Marlowe (who is in every scene) just a step ahead of us, his hunches and Epiphanies developing in real time. Marlowe is hired by the aged and infirmed General Sternwood to find out who is blackmailing him over the wild ways of his young daughters. Things immediately go awry however when the blackmailer is murdered with others soon to follow. From its intriguing first scenes at the Sternwood mansion The Big Sleep sweeps you away on a wild goose chase that is more about the journey than the destination. Marlowe is the consummate PI as he doggedly pursues leads trying to remain dispassionate to keep his mind clear and while he's game for a no string's attached hook up with a book store clerk he finds himself falling for Sternwood's older daughter even though she's still a murder suspect.With most of the film shot in heavily atmospheric interiors (fully utilized by Hawks) very little of the Big Sleep sees the light of day. By making the viewer identify with Marlowe, Hawks forces you to pay attention to every shot and detail. Camera movement is minimal but telling. Some leads go nowhere and loose ends remain so keeping the audience guessing and allowing the film to maintain a consistently high level of suspense.As Marlowe, Bogart is in the prime of his career and his element. Cold, confident and suspicious his sardonic clipped delivery engages everyone he encounters in verbal duels that reveal and amuse. Lauren Bacall as the sultry alluring older daughter seems to be the only one able to slow him down but even she is not immune from his third degree and this makes for some memorable jousting. Every other character of significance from Martha Vickers thumb sucking recreational drug using sister of Bacall to Tom Steele's cold blooded Canino fit their roles perfectly. As he did with Cary Grant and Rosalind Russell in His Girl Friday, Hawks balances the sparring and Marlowe gets as well as he gives with a variety of mugs, dames and a butler. The Big Sleep is a confluence of iconic American film elements running on all cylinders. With an abundance of qualities interwoven into its complex plot it invites repeated viewings not only to get answers but to appreciate on different levels as well. It's an American classic.",

Basically dying General Sternwood (Charles Waldron) in Los Angeles hires private-eye detective Philip Marlowe (Humphrey Bogart) to supposedly keep an eye on his daughter Carmen Sternwood (Martha Vickers) who owes many gambling debts to bookseller Arthur Gwynn Geiger (Theodore Von Eltz), but it may in fact be his older daughter Vivian (Lauren Bacall) that needs his help. Marlowe goes to find the bookseller, the shop being looked after by assistant Agnes Louzier (Sonia Darrin), and when he tries to talk to Geiger he finds his body instead, along with a drugged Carmen, and later when he returns the body disappears, and the Sternwood driver is found dead too. Vivian comes to see Marlowe with some blackmail type pictures of Carmen, so he goes back to the bookseller's shop and follows a car to the apartment Joe Brody (Louis Jean Heydt), a gambler who has blackmailed the General, and after returning to talk to Carmen she at first denies any knowledge of the Geiger's murder, but then names Brody as the killer. After an encounter with small-time gangster Eddie Mars (John Ridgely), Marlowe, Vivian and Carmen go to see Brody, with Agnes there too, to get the photos back, but an assailant shoots Brody dead, but the shooter, Geiger's former driver Carol Lundgren (Tommy Rafferty) who killed for revenge. Marlowe needs answers from Mars, and after some stooge work and pressing there is some kind of robbery plot revealed, and Carmen reveals that Mars calls Vivian frequently, and then she tries to seduce him but he refuses to give in to it. There is some kind of murder plot by Harry Jones (Elisha Cook Jr.), hired killer Lash Canino (Bob Steele) is sent to kill Agnes or whatever but Marlowe kills him first, and after some more gossip and revelations a meeting is arranged with Mars at Geiger's place. Guns are pulled out as Mars reveals he blackmailed Vivian to claim a crime of murder, in the chase Mars ends up shot accidentally by his own men, Marlowe calls the police and says that the real murder culprit was the gangster, and he assures Vivian that Carmen will get a doctor's help. Also starring Dorothy Malone as Acme Book Shop, Peggy Knudsen as Mona Mars, Regis Toomey as Chief Inspector Bernie Ohls and Charles D. Brown as Norris the Butler. I will absolutely honest and say that I hardly followed any real plot at all, it was pretty complicated, a review even says that it is complex for most people, for the witty script and the performances by real lovers and to-be husband and wife Bogie and Bacall it is a worthwhile classic detective drama.

            "content": "'The Big Sleep' seems ten times as complicated as 'The Maltese Falcon;' to some people, that makes it a greater cinematic delight, to others, a slightly lesser one. There is a legend going around that, even if it's not true, is fun to believe- that the star, director, and even the writer were uncertain about whether one of the deaths in the film was a suicide or murder, and if it was a murder, who committed it. After seeing 'The Big Sleep,' I am inclined to believe it. Unless you almost literally take notes while watching it, after a certain point your brain just stops trying to keep track of all the persons seen or referred to, on screen and off, who killed whom and who is getting the blame and where the hell Sean Regan is. There are three people that you end up caring about- Philip Marlowe (Humphrey Bogart), Vivian (Lauren Bacall), and Vivian's younger sister Carmen (Martha Vickers). Carmen is an example of an enduring cinematic character type that lives on to this day, the drop-dead gorgeous young woman who is absolutely out of control and doesn't give a damn about anything but having a good time. This being 1946, her personality is drawn mainly by suggestion, and suggestive lines, and Vickers' wickedly suggestive performance. It is said some of her scenes were cut to build up Bacall's part. If that's true, it's a shame. But then 'The Big Sleep' is a pretty naughty film overall for its time. There's Bogart and Bacall's famous conversation with the 'racehorse' analogy, which probably pushed the envelope as far as it would go back then. The film is heavy on dialogue, not so much on action, but you don't really notice it. An air of threatening cold-bloodedness hangs over the proceedings, the feeling that life is cheap and anyone might be killed at any moment on someone else's whim. In this way, it can be seen as a very early precursor to a film like 'Blue Velvet.' When Marlowe walks into a house to find Carmen stoned and completely out of it, one gets the same feeling about the crowd she's been hanging out with that you did in the David Lynch film, where Dennis Hopper casually kidnaps and torments Kyle McLachlan. Bogart of course is perfect as Marlowe; at this stage in his career, he had the hardboiled private eye bit nailed. Lauren Bacall builds on her performance in 'To Have And Have Not' as the brainy and sexy femme fatale who sometimes is too clever for her own good. Martha Vickers is a knockout as the 'nymphy' younger sister. Her constant flirting with Marlowe prompts his classic line, \"She tried to sit in my lap while I was standing up.\" The rest of the cast is standard issue, the usual Warner Bros. stock company of character actors, with one exception- a very young Dorothy Malone portrays a sexy bookworm with whom Marlowe has a rainy day tryst. She makes the most of her scene. 'The Big Sleep' is one of those films that you can watch again and again and always pick up something new from, an example of old-time Hollywood at its most riskily and racily adventurous.",

So it's a delight to see Howard Hawks' interpretation, true to the spirit of the books, with Humphrey Bogart capturing the Marlowe character perfectly: outwardly cynical (and very funny), inwardly a man deeply upset by a world in which some men call the big shots while everyone else has to hustle for a dollar. The female characters (most notably Lauren Bacall's) also reflect Marlowe's attitudes to women, which are not always edifying but which are part of the fabric of Chandler's world. Even more surprisingly, the film sticks almost to the letter of Chandler's labyrinthine plot. Of course, in such an old film, there are always going to be limitations: the action scenes are fairly lame, and the soundtrack is intrusive (although as the film progressed, I learnt to ignore it and enjoyed the movie more as a result). Of course, Chandler is so much imitated that the shadow of parody lies heavy over modern attempts to recreate his work; better stick to the original, and best.",

He scores as private eye Philip Marlowe whose professional curiosity gets him slugged, conked, kicked and beaten up -- and who finally unravels the mystery even if it's eluded the audience.

So that night I took her to see a Bogart picture The Big Sleep.The Big Sleep was strange title for a picture where nobody sleeps. I figured it might metaphor for death, as there was sure a lot of bodies. Murder, pornography, gambling, rackets, crooks, beautiful dames and a famous private dick to figure what the hell was going on. The dick was smarter than I was. He had the mystery licked in no time, while I was so confused I'd finished two large tubs of popcorn before I even remembered there was a dead man in car in a car that nobody knew who did it.As fuzzy as it made my head, I liked the picture. It was set in the L.A that nobody cares to think about when they picture that beautiful dream of Hollywood with its sunshine and palm trees. It was a city drenched in rain and shadows, littered with bullet holes and obscured by smoke.The dame was sharper than me, with memory like an iron trap, she remembered names, relationships and who said what to who five scenes back. I'm glad she was with me during that picture. I'm still glad.Bogart played Marlowe as tough guy with code, rattling off witty ripostes as he swept aside all the tough guys, femme fatales, leading ladies and smart alecks who crossed his path. He wasn't afraid to use his gun either and could take a licking.He flirted outrageously with a number of beautiful Hollywood dames. Martha Vickers' amorous Carmen Sternwood stole every scene she was in. Dorothy Malone was radiant as the kind of bookstore clerk you don't see in my town. He even got in in a taxicab with a beautiful dame driver. Now I've had dreams about times when this happened to me but some fellas just have more luck than others.Lauren Bacall as Mrs Rutledge lit my soul on fire with some of the most colourful talk you ever heard from a dame. She does kind of facial expressions that could make a man forget he's watching a picture with another dame.There were other tough guys in the picture, lots of them in on the racket and looking to undermine Bogart's manliness, but you can guess how it all ends up. I'm not saying any more about the story in case you haven't seen it yet.It was a great picture. One that shows you an atmosphere and let's you hear talk so beautiful you'd think it was written by Chandler. What more do you want than Bogart and Bacall to take you somewhere for two hours? Two hours away from life, from reason and from yourself. Well you might want a smart dame to tell you what the hell is going on.",

With both Bogey and Bacall in the forms of their lives as they carry out their verbal sparring whilst getting more and more entangled in a web of intrigue and corruption that neither of them an escape, the film moves at an incredible speed as corpses of the great and the good mount up on both sides.The dialogue is glorious and it's no coincidence that the writer of this also went on to write some of the most memorable lines put on celluloid in \"The Empire Strikes Back\".

The 1946 version is the one that has become the classic beloved for decades. But there is a pre-release 1945 version. The primary difference between the two is that the 1946 version has additional scenes with Bacall meant to capitalize on the popularity of the Bogie/Bacall pairing. The 1945 version has a slower pace with more plot exposition and a different actress playing Mona Mars.

These characters can afford to be tough because they're both outsiders. Each inhabits the same private, disillusioned world, where nothing really matters except an oddly medieval quest for Truth. They are knights, tilting at evil, wherever they find it. But unlike their medieval counterparts, they have no friends, no companions, no-one in whom they can trust. Even their lady-loves are suspect.Oddly, both Spade and Marlowe also seem to have a death wish or at the very least a compulsion towards failure. They love to antagonize everyone, no matter who they are. Spade and Marlowe simply can't resist pandering to their own sense of superiority and self- importance. At all costs, they must be smart. A typical exchange in \"The Big Sleep\" finds Marlowe rebuffing the olive-branch-offering from big- time gambling operator, Eddie Mars, as they both puzzle over a blood stain in a house owned by Geiger, a blackmailer:MARS: \"Got any ideas, soldier?\" MARLOWE: \"A couple. Somebody gunned Geiger, or somebody got gunned by Geiger who ran away, or Geiger had meat for dinner and likes to do his butchering on the parlor floor.\"Nonetheless, despite all its hip cynicism, a softening process was started in \"Big Sleep\" on Bogart's screen persona. A softening that makes it difficult to credit that movie-goers have so quickly forgotten the dames-are-poison-so-slap-'em-around, tough nuts of the 1950s like Ladd, Ford, Lancaster and Mitchum. It's in \"The Big Sleep\" that Bogie meets his verbal match in Lauren Bacall:BOGIE: \"You've got a touch of class, but I don't know how you'd do over a stretch of ground.\"BACALL: \"A lot depends on who's in the saddle.\"True.

The story is filled with twists, turns, lies, murder and surprises: it's a complex, convoluted film noir. The beginning doesn't make much sense, because many characters and ideas are introduced. Eventually most of it is pieced together, and things wrap up nicely. But you have to think when watching the Big Sleep.The best part is Philip Marlowe, played by the legendary Humphrey Bogart. He's an awesome character: a hardworking, tough detective with noir style, and he seduces no less than 4 women simply by being himself. You root for him entirely. Also, his disguise in the Geiger bookstore is simple yet hilarious.Opposite him is Vivian, played by Lauren Bacall. They have great chemistry, but while Bogart in Casablanca had 'love' chemistry, here he has 'desire' chemistry. It's far more sensual and interesting.Speaking of sensual, there's a lot about this film that seems to be boundary-pushing. Carmen Sternwood, Vivian's sister, shocked me in her first scene by wearing a short dress. This is the 40's! Conservatism! Also, when Vivian scratches her upper leg, the notion of it is given dialogue. Just to tell audiences, \"Look! She's scratching her thigh ON CAMERA!\" I really liked The Big Sleep, more than I thought I would. The characters are likable, the plot is thick, and it's a well- made film.

Bacall is more interested in him than solving any problem, indeed she seems in denial of any puzzle or problem. In the original 1945 version, the tale is set out fairly simply and found itself shelved. With the real life coming together of the two stars, a studio keenness to rescue a struggling Bacall's career and a willingness all around to play around with the original and 'spice up' proceedings with the now particularly charismatic pairing and we have lift off. Even as I watch this once more I am aware that not being able to easily follow is not unlike a dream and that in the same way I am drawn to say, the works of Bunuel or Fellini, has something to do with this relationship with 'dream'. It further occurs to me that there are also many low budget efforts, for instance the works of Jess Franco, where there just weren't the funds to fully expound the idea and that, in this case by default, we are left with this dreamlike experience that is so potent, almost as if it were subliminal and we understand without knowing.",

There were also cuts for a second version of the film (the one that is shown now) that were made to enhance Lauren Bacall's part.\nChandler's exposition establishes that private eye Phillip Marlowe (Humphrey Bogart) is hired by the crippled millionaire General Sternwood (Charles Waldron) to fend off Geiger, a rare books dealer who apparently is blackmailing his daughter Carmen (Martha Vickers) over some gambling debts. Vickers is wonderful as the alluring \"out of control\" sister whose \"you're cute\" epithets directed at Marlowe, endear us toward her from the get go. Unfortunately, due to the decision to enhance Bacall's part to capitalize on her burgeoning real-life romance with Bogart, a fair number of really good scenes with Vickers were cut!\nAdding to the confusion is Sternwood's desire to find out about his former employee, the missing Sean Regan, whom we never see during the entire film. This is perhaps the central weakness of the 1946 version of The Big Sleep. In the novel, Regan was married to Vivian Sternwood (Lauren Bacall) but here in the film she's now the divorced Mrs. Rutledge.\nDue to the previously alluded to production code, the nature of Geiger's business is changed from a pornography dealer to one in rare books. Thus it's unclear what Geiger and his associates are trying to hide when Marlowe begins to investigate. Before the break into the Second Act, there's a sexually suggestive scene where Marlowe shares a drink with a bookshop salesgirl (Dorothy Malone) across the street, while he waits for Geiger to leave his shop.\nThe break into the Second Act occurs when Marlowe is outside Geiger's house when he's murdered, only to find Carmen present along with a hidden camera with the film missing (in the novel, Carmen is found naked). Marlowe is then informed by a detective that the Sternwood's chauffeur Owen Taylor has been murdered after the Sternwood car containing his body has been fished out of the harbor.\nThis is the second weak part of the film-we never see Taylor nor do we ever find out who murdered him or whether he committed suicide (Chandler himself could not provide an explanation when asked!). It turns out that it's Taylor (who was in love with Carmen) who murdered Geiger but through Chandler's clever plot misdirection, for awhile we're led to believe it was Geiger's associate, Joe Brody (Louis Heydt) who killed Geiger.\nMarlowe finds Brody is now blackmailing the Sternwood sisters with the photo of Carmen that was taken back at the Geiger house. After Marlowe is able to disarm Brody, he learns that Brody followed Taylor from the murder scene and managed to get a hold of the incriminating pictures from Taylor, who got into a car accident. What really was needed was a flashback chronicling Brody's story (which was indeed inserted into the inept 1978 film version starring Robert Mitchum).\nThe midpoint of the film begins with the murder of Brody by a man named Lundgren whom Marlowe apprehends. The production code did not allow for what was made clear in the novel-that Lundgren was Geiger's driver and also his gay lover. Lundgren mistakenly believed it was Brody who killed Geiger and was unaware of Taylor's responsibility. The only clue as to Geiger's homosexuality is that Marlowe finds Geiger's body laid out on his bed AFTER it had earlier disappeared from the murder scene.\nWhile the case now appears closed, Marlowe is still trying to solve the mystery of Regan's disappearance. This takes him to Eddie Mars's private casino where he finds Vivian warbling a tune for the assembled throng of gamblers and then engages in a steamy conversation full of allusions to horse-racing (a stand-in for a series of marked sexual innuendoes). This is one of the scenes that was inserted into the second version to ramp up the chemistry between Bogie and Bacall.\nThe action picks up when Mars's thugs beat Marlowe up in a deserted alley. He gets a tip from Harry Jones (Elisha Cook Jr.) that Agnes (Geiger's former assistant) has information as to the whereabouts of Mona Mars, Eddie's wife, who last saw Regan. Marlowe witnesses the murder of Jones (by poison) at the hands of Canino, one of Mars's hired thugs.\nThe dark moment of Act Two occurs when Marlowe is captured by Canino but is freed by Vivian and then kills Canino in an exciting shootout. That leaves the climax back at Geiger's house where Marlowe confronts Eddie Mars after he deduces that Mars was blackmailing Vivian who was trying to cover up that it was Carmen who murdered Regan. Marlowe shoots Eddie who tries to flee and is shot by his own thugs as he is unable to identify himself in time as he leaves the house.\nAgain some kind of flashback of Regan's murder could have made the narrative a bit clearer. The Big Sleep is an enjoyable potboiler compromised somewhat by the production code and two missing characters who are explained through dialogue but never show up on screen. Bogie and Bacall aficionados will also dig the chemistry they have together in contrast to Chandler's more cynical ending, where there's no romance between the principals at all!",

While it does seem a little long, that's because the initial plot appears to resolve itself as another takes its place, which makes for an odd yet satisfying pacing.

Bogart in particular was born to play Marlowe and he spits out Raymond Chandlers hard boiled dialogue like no one else could.Marlowe is in a way a forerunner of James Bond every woman wants him and every man wants to be him. In the world of Phillip Marlowe every dame is beautiful even the librarians and taxi drivers, and of course they all fall in love with him! Bacall is the femme fatale and surely one of the sexiest movie characters of all time.With a supporting cast of goons, gamblers, dames and hustlers the Big Sleep hurtles along at a storming pace and the two hour running time seems to just disappear. I would recommend this film to anyone who loves great movies, but particularly to those into Film Noir and detective movies.

Bacall is less effective, in my opinion, and the character seems indecisive about which side she is on. For example, why does she cut the ropes used to tie Bogey if she is \"in\" with the Eddie Mars crowd? The dialog is sharp and more bodies fall than we can keep track off, but it all has something to do with the \"Carmen\" character.

THE BIG SLEEP would be Bogart's only outing as Philip Marlowe, Chandler's hard-boiled private eye, and he's absolutely dynamite in the part.Based on Chandler's first published book, it took more than five years for a movie version to make it to the theaters. Much of that time involved putting together a script that would pacify the Hays Office because the book contained elements of nymphomania, drugs, pornography, and homosexuality, topics that were considered a no-no in those days. With Bogie as one of Warner Bros biggest stars, it was logical to cast him as Marlowe, and because he and newcomer Lauren Bacall had undeniable chemistry on TO HAVE AND HAVE NOT, every was anxious to reteam them. Filming eventually commenced in autumn of 1944 and concluded in January.But Warner Bros decided to postpone the release of THE BIG SLEEP due to the war themed pictures they currently had in production. Now that the conflict was winding down, Warners was anxious to get them distributed as fast as possible; a detective story could wait. However, during the delay, there was concerned in the front office that Bogie and Bacall didn't ignite the same sparks as they did in their previous movie. Plus, by that time, they'd fallen in love in real life and gotten themselves married.So, almost a year after filming had wrapped, Hawks, Bogart, Bacall, and crew members returned to the set to shoot new sequences. Because the original actress who played Mona Mars wasn't available -or was rejected- her scene was reshot with a contract player named Peggy Knudsen.",

            "content": "\"I don't like your manners.\", says Bacall, to which Bogart dryly retorts:\"And I'm not crazy about yours. I didn't ask to see you. I don't mind if you don't like my manners, I don't like them myself. They are pretty bad. I grieve over them on long winter evenings. I don't mind your ritzing me drinking your lunch out of a bottle. But don't waste your time trying to cross-examine me.\"And if you want to know how long Bogie's tirade lasted, count how many seconds it took you to read it and divide it by then. That's \"The Big Sleep\", snappy and witty dialogs popping like corn seeds on a frying pan, delivered at the same speed the most experimented typist put them on the paper, with the little 'ding' at the end. There are chances that most of the lines won't be immediately gotten at the first viewing, but don't worry, the film is known for being very hard to follow, in plot and words.Still, isn't that the mark of great movies to have a little something that will inevitably make you eager to watch it again? Directed by Howard Hawks, \"The Big Sleep\" is one of these films where one experience isn't satisfying at all, especially story -wise, you feel the need to watch it again, because it's one of the most convoluted and complex plot you'll ever have to follow, just as if you were tailing a Jaguar, while driving a tractor. But the secret of its greatness is that while you watch it a second time to understand it better, you end up understanding why it's regarded as one of the greatest film noir, Bogart movies, American movies and stop caring about the plot.And why should we care about it, the plot is so complex that even the starting mission is liable to confuse viewers. Philip Marlowe, Raymond Chandler's most iconic creation, is engaged by an elderly general to look for a man who blackmails his daughter, he mentions some gambling debts and the mysterious disappearance of Shawn Regan, a former member of the IRA who worked for him, and Marlowe's army buddy. At that point of the film, we try to memorize their names, but a few scenes later, they'll only be part of a never-ending chain of events where each twist leads up to a new plot within a plot.A blackmailer using a library as a front for illegal activities, a slutty spoiled brat, Sternwood's youngest daughter, Carmen, magnificently played by Martha Vickers, a mysterious murder followed by the death of a chauffeur named Owen Taylor. No matter how focused you stay, you'll lose it sooner or later, depending on your attention span, the film is a real challenge for concentration. Yet there seems to be some logic in the way events follow each other. It seems to obey the same pattern, whoever possesses an information will immediately be killed before (sometimes unknowingly) giving part of it to Marlowe. The point is to use a gun to make them talk before someone will use it to silence them forever. Roles can be switched though, but the way to the solution is paved by warm cadavers. There's another pattern, every encounter with a female, is full of sexual innuendo, starting with an irresistible exchange with Dorothy Malone as the scene-stealing librarian, perhaps one of the most erotic Bogie moments, there's a sort of modern chemistry in the raving beauty of Malone, the way she twists her tongue, and innocently take off her glasses and loosen her hair, provoking the perfect reaction from Bogie \"Hellooooo\". And who can't resist to the female cab driver giving her number and telling him he can call any time. \"Day or night?\" \"Night's better, I work during the day\"I said in \"To Have and Have Not\", also directed by Hawks, that Bogie found his match in Bacall, on that level, \"The Big Sleep\" is one hell of a matchbox. Yet, if all the girls never quite overshadow Bacall, they're just here for the show, TO show Marlowd, the private eye, as a man with lots of charisma with women, but he doesn't fool around, he's got an obvious fondness on one of them, Viviane, Carmen's sister. It's still a Bogart and Bacall movie, so I just saved the best for last. Again, at a time where their romance wasn't secret anymore, Howard Hawks, the matchmaker, knew how to exploit their chemistry again and create another classic with the most legendary Hollywood couple. And the fact that is a Bacall movie is crucial for another reason; we know it'll lead up to our two leads in each other's arms, that's the point, so the rest, starting with the story, hardly matters. The merit of great movies is to reinvent the rules of screen writing, not everything has a point, except allowing the crime investigation to progress, and the only possible outcome is the romantic reunion, the climax of all these interludes where together, talk in coded messages, full of risqu\u00e9 innuendo, to better hide their feelings, whether it's a racy debate about horses, or a hilarious prank call that show how screen writing wasn't just meant to make the plot evolve.Legend has it that neither Bogart, nor Hawks knew who and how did the chauffeur die, not even the author \u0085 but who cared what was in that black briefcase in \"Pulp Fiction\" or was 'Keyser Soze' a made up person or not \u0085 some questions are better left unanswered, and that's part of their legend. And in a film whose only purpose is to showcase extraordinary abilities of screen writing transcended by tremendous acting talents, why being so orthodox about the rules of storytelling, confident writers make their own rules. It doesn't work with every movie, but in \"The Big Sleep\"'s case, it does. And how!",

The film follows LA Private Eye Phillip Marlowe ( Bogart) on a blackmail case...and follows a trail peopled with murderers, pornographers, rogues, the spoiled rich and much more. But it is Raymond Chandler's legendary gumshoe, Marlowe who solves it all in hard-boiled style. And style is what this film is all about. From its sultry mood, to its incredibly witty script. Director Howard Hawks serves up a feast for the eyes and ears in regards to the films countless snappy character encounters. The scenes involving Bogart and Lauren Bacall particularly are the ones most talked about.The thing I love about Bogart is that in one scene he can scare the living **** out of you and in the next he would go all puppy eyed on you! However, the scenes involving Martha Vickers, the kid sister Carmen are so much more interesting to me personally. Vickers is just a hoot to watch as the sex mad younger sister. Furthermore, my favorite scene from the film doesn't even involve, Bogart and Bacall. It involves Bogart, of course.... ( he is in the majority of the scenes, as our eyes and ears of the film) but it involves another actress-Dorothy Malone. The scene of which I am speaking of, has Bogart's character held up in a rain storm during a stakeout at a bookstore, and of course I believe the sexiest moment of that scene is when she closes the window blinds. I also love the way he says \"Hello!\" when she takes off her glasses, and lets her hair down. Dorothy Malone also improvised this scene as well. \"Did you do this?\" \"That? Oh yes, that's a little special service....I always provide all my clients.\"The film's pace does suffer at times, no doubt due to the film's ( adapted from a Raymond Chandler novel) difficult and at times hard to understand plot. Chandler was even quoted as saying he didn't know who had committed one of the seven murders in his own book.\"How do you like your brandy, sir?\" \"In a glass.\"These her signatures? Who's Arthur Geiger?\" \"I haven't the faintest idea.\" \"Did you ask her?\" \"No, and I don't intend to.

The effect was not unlike what I would imagine being pumped full of tranquilizers and being made to run the New York Marathon would be like. A big sleep, indeed...Thankfully, because Howard Hawks did take the time to listen to his audience before releasing the version known best to later generations, he managed to hammer the movie version into something that never gets dull, not for a minute. Granted, you're not sure who's who, what just happened, or when the next dead body is going to hit the ground (this particular mystery has the highest body count of any I've seen in recent memory outside of \"L.A. Confidential\"), but the razor-sharp dialogue keeps things entertaining throughout.Bogie could call himself Phil Marlowe, Sam Spade, Rick Blaine, or Howdy Doody for that matter, but Chandler, when asked about his performance in \"The Big Sleep\", probably said it best, \"Bogart is always superb playing Bogart.\" Here, he plays that role probably the best that I have ever seen him do it. He takes more of a beating this time out than usual, worked over a couple of times and none too gently, either. The sense one gets is that he's a man trying to get a handle on a situation that keeps threatening to spin out of control. The miracle is that Bogie is able to keep track of the plotline better than the audience (including myself).Of course, I would be remiss if I did not mention a certain lady by the professional name of Lauren Bacall. She provides the film with it's other stable axis. She comes off as mysterious, tough, over her head in trouble, and head over heels in love. The moment where she and Bogie clicked into place for me was the phone \"conversation\" with the police line they dialed up. I get the impression that she didn't want Bogie to probe any deeper because she knew that he'd land in the spot she was in. Of course, getting info from her is like trying to pry open Fort Knox with a crowbar. She keeps her cards as close to her chest, if not closer, than Bogie. You never know where she's going to pop up next, but you know it's going to be interesting.Now, to answer the all-important question of who killed Regan,...watch the movie again. Failing that, read the novel (if you can). The answer to that burning question IS there, but, like everything else in this film, it's tossed out so fast that if you blink, you miss it. Failing that, just enjoy it, I say. Bogie and Bacall pairings don't get any better than this.",

Marlowe traces the threat to a bookstore owner, who soon winds up dead. Delving deeper, Marlowe links the stiff to a prominent mobster. As bodies start to multiply, can Marlowe figure who's crossing who ?I will confess straight off that despite multiple viewings I never really understand what's going on in this movie. Famously nobody was ever sure who killed the chauffeur (I think it's Joe Brody) but I also don't really understand the blackmail scam, why the kid shoots Brody, the dirt Eddie Mars has on Vivian or why Mars' wife goes along with it. There are answers to these questions, but the movie is so beguiling with its fancy-pants dialogue, crazy characters and seemingly contradictory moments that it's best to just surrender to its stylish charm. Whilst I reckon I marginally prefer Sam Spade in The Maltese Falcon, this is Bogart firing on all cylinders; tough guy, funny, romantic and sharp as nails, his jaded gumshoe qualities perfectly counterpointed by Bacall's elegance - the scene where they give the police dispatcher the runaround is classic banter. The supporting cast are the most lovable bunch of scheming white-knuckled grifters you'd never want to meet, with Vickers (as the spoilt hussy), Cook (as the unlucky bloodhound) and Darrin (as the devious bookstore clerk) all standout. Hawks is in complete command of the movie's grammar, carefully setting up all the key scenes for the maximum payoff and dazzling us with clever touches and a heady brew of mystery, potboiler and romance. My favourite line (and one of the best comebacks in all cinema) is, \"I don't mind if you don't like my manners. I don't like them myself. They're pretty bad. I grieve over them on long winter evenings.\". Brilliantly scripted by William Faulkner, Leigh Brackett and Jules Furthman, based on the 1939 hardboiled classic novel by Raymond Chandler. Remade with Robert Mitchum as Marlowe in 1978, but this original is far more stylish and iconic.",

Anyway there were other things I didn't like, for instance the Phillip Marlowe character is not the Phillip Marlowe from Chandlers creation, the movie version makes him come off as a James Bond type womaniser, in the books he is just not like that . Also there is a scene in the movie where he leads a man to his death intentionally, Marlowe is not the sadistic type, he does not enjoy killing or seeing people killed. He would rather see justice done by the law if anything. Another thing they left out was the greatest scene in the whole book, where Carmen tries to kill Marlowe, such a wasted opportunity. Also all the characters where very shallow on screen and I feel like they could have been portrayed better or even true to the novel had the movie been directed and written with more thought.",

            "content": "\"The Big Sleep\" was a Bogart/Bacall vehicle first and a Raymond Chandler adaptation second. The master of detective fiction was pragmatic about this: he didn't care for the romantic storyline, but acknowledged that \"in Hollywood you cannot make a picture which is not essentially a love story, that is to say, a story in which sex is paramount.\" And he enjoyed Humphrey Bogart's portrayal of private detective Philip Marlowe, calling Bogie \"the genuine article.\" (See Frank MacShane's \"The Life of Raymond Chandler\" for more about the troubled relationship between Chandler and Hollywood.) While Bogart does make a great Marlowe, the romantic aspect of the film *is* overemphasized and everything is a little too smooth-edged and tidy for its own good. The Los Angeles of the '30s and '40s just didn't look like this--and, more importantly, Chandler's books didn't feel like this. They were full of betrayal and disappointment and resignation, and it was precisely the author's willingness to confront these less pleasant facts of human existence that elevated his work above mere genre writing. Having said all that, \"The Big Sleep\" is an enjoyable film (miles better than anything Hollywood is grinding out today, certainly), and a few scattered scenes remain true to Chandler. Could anyone but Elisha Cook Jr., after all, have played down-at-the-heels but noble Harry Jones? And there are sexy dames to spare: my favorite is the luscious Dorothy Malone as a bookstore proprietress whose beauty is ill-concealed by a pince-nez and a prim little outfit. On the other hand, there are a few things I absolutely hate--things which depart so far from Chandler's vision as to be ridiculous, like Lauren Bacall merrily singing 'And Her Tears Flowed Like Wine' (\"She's a real sad tomato, she's a busted valentine!\") at John Ridgely's casino. But the film is good on the whole and, again, it's more about Bogie and Bacall than it is about Chandler. With that in mind, even hardcore Chandler fanatics should get a kick out of this cool, breezy relic of a bygone age. (My personal favorite of all the cinematic interpretations of Raymond Chandler is the Paul Bogart-helmed \"Marlowe\", based on Chandler's fifth novel \"The Little Sister\" and starring James Garner as the immortal private eye. Still, this film didn't quite nail the Chandler vibe, either. It could be that he-- like H.P. Lovecraft, another great American writer whose work transcended the narrow confines of its genre--is essentially unfilmable.) 6 and 1/2 stars.",

The film was a showpiece for the legendary Hollywood couple, but the entire cast is great and script, especially the stars' repartee, is outstanding.

The scene where the little sister confronts and almost shoots Phillip Marlowe. But there's enough good stuff here that makes this a classic.The dialogue comes quick and fast and most of it holds up quite well over forty years later. Bogart: \"It says so on page 47 in the book on how to be a private detective.\" Bacall: \"Is that where it shows you how a be a comedian?\" Influences of this movie show up in other ones in different other ones. One inside joke Hawks played was having every single female character making a play on Bogart. His scene with Dorothy Malone is quite funny. Years later, Kubrick would play the same joke in \"Eyes Wide Shut.\" Every character would be aroused when they meet Tom Cruise.Don't try to figure it out. Just enjoy this 1940's ride.",

On paper, what should be the biggest strength of the movie - writing in a form of already existing novel, became the biggest weakness of it in a form of screenplay that removed the most important parts of the novel, making this movie incoherent, bloated mess. I didn't read the novel (yet), but watching the movie i felt like some threads that keep the story together are missing. It's almost like i felt that director knows the complete story of the book, but he is not revealing it properly for the audiences, and he is still expecting you to follow up on the story somehow.Naturally, what happens when you adapt book to the screen, you as a director/writer have to choose which parts of the story will be in the movie, and still make it comprehensible. I'm not sure how big chunk of the story went out of the window there, but by conducting short research after the movie ended, i found out that this movie was a victim of the censorship that was really hard and strict towards movies in those days, therefore stripping this movie from crucial plot points that included some heavy subject matter, thus making it convoluted mess.The way new characters are introduced one at the time as the movie went on, just made me more and more bored and angry because the director and writers chose the cheapest way to make plot progress further and make things more confusing. Also, there is some questionable decision-making of the main protagonist in some scenes which doesn't work from a logical standpoint or the standpoint of the exact characterization of the main protagonist.I really didn't buy the romance element between Bogie and Bacall. I'm not talking about chemistry between the actors, there is a lot of that there, but the way screenplay gets their characters together. I could recognize some lust being there, but not pure love in the way that was depicted.What i love most about this movie, besides acting which is great, is the dialogue. Good dialogue is one of the most important aspects of the film noir genre, and good dialogue in this movie is what pushes it up on the ladder from 2 to 3 stars rating for me. The movie often has some intentionally hilarious moments, mostly in correlation to great dialogue that i mentioned above, but sometimes unintentionally hilarious moments as well. Literally in every scene where Bogie interacts with any woman, you know it's gonna be fun.Also, sound of those slaps was hilarious.Overall, considering the fact that i had a headache after the movie ended, for some weird reason i didn't hate it.",

Having read the book on which it was based on by Raymond Chandler, I knew that certain aspects would have to be gotten rid of as they simply wouldn't have passed the Hays Office. Perhaps these things that were left out (such as what Geiger's book store really was) helped confuse people even more while watching an adaptation of an already (enjoyably) convoluted book. But the plot in this movie comes a long second to the Noir atmosphere that Hawks conjures up. He really pins down what Noir is all about, full of femme fatales, heavies and dark, brooding camera-work. Humphrey Bogart as Private Detective Philip Marlowe may not physically resemble the character in the novels, but he catches the spirit of Marlowe that few others did (Dick Powell in \"Farewell My Lovely\" AKA \"Murder, My Sweet\" (1944) is perhaps the only other actor who did) and his chemistry with Lauren Becall as Vivian Rutledge (Reagen in the novel), the oldest daughter of the dieing General Sternwood (Charles Waldron), who hires Bogart to take a blackmailer off his back, is quite extraordinary. Also, Martha Vickers as the wild, wild Carmen Sternwood is brilliant. The opening scene she has with Bogart is unbelievable sexy and pins down the flavour of the book.

Bogart still is antiperspirant free in the sopping first scene. Then viewers are again forced to plod through the deaths of Nympho Sister Carmen's Seven Stooges.

Sam Spade in \"The Maltese Falcon\", Bogart then proceeded to do the very same with his portrayal of that other great pulp private detective creation of the day, Raymond Chandler's Philip Marlowe in Hawks's stylish film-noir \"The Big Sleep\".Knowing in advance the film's reputation for its twisty-turny plot, I tried my hardest to keep up but just like it seems everyone else who has ever watched it, including reportedly Chandler himself, my head was spinning more than Linda Blair's by the end-up. But as they say, sometimes it's about the journey not the destination, which I think is largely true here, although I would have preferred to have kept some sort of handle on proceedings as one bewildering character and / or situation succeeded another.Still it was great to see Bogart and Bacall indulging in their verbal horseplay at the restaurant and I love that practically every woman in the film for some reason seems to be flirting with Marlowe, indeed at one point there's a strong suggestion that one particular young and attractive female book-store owner has favoured our craggy anti-hero with a particularly memorable lunch-break.Hawks directs the film at about the same breakneck pace as any of his celebrated screwball comedies like \"Bringing Up Baby\" or \"His Girl Friday\" often employing his trademark rapid fire, overlapping dialogue technique. If Bogart naturally dominates proceedings, all the women in the film make telling contributions, in other words it's not all about Bogey and Betty. Check out in particular a young Dorothy Malone as that aforementioned obliging book-shop proprietress and Martha Vickers as the kittenish little-sister (another Chandler book-title!).Just goes to show that, at least on this rare occasion, plotting isn't always essential to a great film.

There is a ton of banter and fast dialogue, Humphrey Bogart is the consummate tough guy detective, and the bodies pile up amidst plot twists and action. The performances, the atmosphere, and the dialogue all make the film a classic, but beware, the plot is notorious for being difficult to follow, at least in its entirety. My advice is to pay attention to names in the film when they're mentioned. Sometimes a little factoid drops quickly, and if you miss it, you'll get lost. And, just know that even if you do keep up (and possibly pause the movie to look at the wiki plot summary, lol), you still may be confused. Why? Well, because there are several plot points which are never fully explained. I won't list them here, but they are still debated and commented on 70 years later. Frankly, I think Howard Hawks did a huge disservice to the film by cutting a scene which would have explained at least some of its convoluted plot, believing that audiences wouldn't care.With that said, he certainly made it interesting by deciding to have every woman flirt heavily with Humphrey Bogart's character. This starts in the opening scene, when Martha Vickers saunters out in shorts, rolls her eyes around seductively, and then falls into his arms. Subtle, eh? Moments later, Bogart is in a bookstore with Dorothy Malone (then 19 years old), and after the two hit it off, she closes her shop in the middle of the day to share a drink with him, with the implication being it doesn't stop there. He then takes a taxi and makes a connection with the driver (Joy Barlow), she gives him her card \"in case you can use me again\", but tells him to call at night, because she works during the day. This is just in the first 20 minutes, and before the steamier scenes with Lauren Bacall, who Bogart would marry in real life three months after filming finished. The chemistry they had translates to the screen, spurred on by memorable lines:This first one, as they compare each other to thoroughbreds: \nBogart: \"You don't like to be rated yourself.\"\nBacall: \"I haven't met anyone yet that can do it. Any suggestions?\"\nBogart: \"Well, I can't tell till I've seen you over a distance of ground. You've got a touch of class, but I don't know how far you can go.\"\nBacall: \"A lot depends on who's in the saddle.\"After kissing her:\nBacall: \"I liked that. I'd like more.\" Before the spin of the roulette wheel:\nDealer: \"You ready lady?\"\nBacall: \"Yeah, I'm ready.\"\nBogart (softly, over her shoulder): \"So am I.\"And lastly:\nBogart: \"What's wrong with you?\"\nBacall: \"Nothing you can't fix.\"There are also all sorts of other playful moments. At one point, Bogart and Bacall carry on a prank telephone conversation with a police officer, which ends with Bogart saying \"I can do what? Where? Oh no, I wouldn't like that. Neither would my daughter.\" In another, Vickers asks, \"Is he as cute as you are?\", to which the grizzled Bogart replies, \"Nobody is.\" Bogart also brings a smile when he turns up his hat, dons sunglasses, and carries on as an intellectual while trying to get information from a woman in a bookstore (Sonia Darrin). At all turns, Bogart is ready with quick replies, whether he's talking tough, flirting, or joking around, making him the man every guy wishes he could be. And, while a lot of attention is placed on Bogart, Bacall, and Vickers, and rightfully so, the performances from the villains, the mastermind (John Ridgely) and his right-hand man (Bob Steele), are also fantastic. Overall, I find I've got to deduct a little because of the issues with the plot, but still, it's quite a film.",

On the other hand, any really good film, a film that endures through generations, does so because it has universal appeal.Well, I'm part of the universe and it didn't appeal. For one, I got confused, confused over the essential part of a 'who dunnit'. That is, who killed who and why. This picture just ends up with too many dead bodies and too many suspects with too many motives. After a while, you lose track. Presumably the most satisfying aspect of a 'who dunnit' is knowing who killed who in the end and why. This leaves you unsatisfied.So a lesson to writers \u0096 don't have too many bodies or suspects. A reader, or viewer, shouldn't have to keep a chart to keep track. Keep the story simple and focused. If you must have the necessary 'dead ends' or 'false trails' make sure they don't blur the essential truth of your story.Also, I haven't watched black and white since I was a kid. As an adult, and one involved in film, I can see an essential weakness \u0096 the night time scenes. Night scenes in black and white lose too much detail, especially around the periphery of the screen. Oft times it's like your peering through a keyhole. And the contrast is either too jagged or too blurred, depending on how the scene is shot.Not really a legitimate critique, just an observation, like seeing the black face actors in 'Birth of Nation'.

Easy to love and the formula works to this day. Nicely done quickly moving and never a dull moment movie that is kept going by shear acting and directing without catching ones breath. The audience pants along liking the fact that Bogart explains everything so nicely as they cant wait to get to the next scene after scene after scene. You have to listen well in this movie because everyone talks quick and if you don't hear an answer to a question, then you have to ask or go see it again. A private eye who was experienced and in good with the cops was considered the player of players by all. The cops needed him to do and say things they couldn't and his clients needed to get things done the cops wouldn't like. Private eyes charged accordingly and traded favors too. High risk and high gain with one downside which is that you have to take a beating every once in a while but it is all worth it. Note where Bogart keeps his guns and only uses them when he has to. He makes his living telling or exposing the truth that will bring you up and then down and back again. Back then, people feared the police, thugs and jail time. It was also common to display a sense of humor as a way of showing your courage even when things looked bad. The funny thing is it works because people admire someone who laughs in the face of danger if done correctly. Bogarts part of playing the private eye or shamus does this extremely well. The book this is based on goes into details that the Hayes Code would never permit so read if desired. Not a bad movie to snack by as the action of the flick goes nicely with your own hand movements. Great movie for sunflower seeds and tasty drink. Enjoy Bogart at his best",

            "content": "The Big Sleep is based on Raymond Chandler's 1939 novel of the same name. Despite its widely regarded convoluted plot, The Big Sleep ranks among the best film noirs of all-time.Private detective Philip Marlowe (Humphrey Bogart) is summoned to the Sternwood mansion. He's welcomed by Norris the butler (Charles D. Brown) and meets Carmen Sternwood (Martha Vickers), the flirtatious and ditzy daughter of General Sternwood (Charles Waldron). Marlowe meets with wheelchair-bound, widower and millionaire, General Sternwood. He wants Marlowe to resolve the gambling debts that Carmen owes to bookseller Arthur Gwynn Geiger. He mentions Joe Brody, a gambler he once paid off and Sean Regen, an employee and friend who's gone missing. Before he leaves, he meets the alluring Vivian Rutledge (Lauren Bacall), Carmen's older divorced sister. She believes her father's true motive is to find Sean Regen.Philip Marlowe's investigation leads him to pornographers, gamblers and blackmailers. He charms every woman he comes into contact with, leaving them aroused. Dorothy Malone plays a book store librarian in a tantalizing scene where she closes up shop after Marlowe sweet talks her. The romance between Marlowe and Vivian gets heated as the film progresses. Vivian works through the investigation with Marlowe, giving him leads and saving him along the way. They both play hard to get, raising the sexual tension until the climactic final words of the film. Marlowe is a rebel of sorts when it comes to detective work and effortlessly seduces every woman he meets. Vivian is mature and sophisticated compared to her younger sister Carmen, who throws herself at Marlowe every chance she gets.The Big Sleep is directed by Howard Hawks. Hawks has many notable works such as one of the greatest comedies from the 1930s, Bringing Up Baby, and one of the best westerns of all-time, Rio Bravo. The camerawork is excellent and gives us every detail in a smooth fashion. The outdoors scenes are mostly rainy and gloomy.The score is beautifully composed by Max Steiner. His musical r\u00e9sum\u00e9 before The Big Sleep includes King Kong, Gone with the Wind and Casablanca. The score is masterful, as it sets the mood of each scene, building up tension and keeping us actively engaged.The screenplay was written by three authors including Nobel Prize and two time Pulitzer Prize winner William Faulkner, as well as Leigh Brackett and Jules Furthman. The script is the major accomplishment of The Big Sleep because the film relies on its quick and intelligent dialogue. Bogart's consistently clever lines bring Marlowe's charming personality to life. \"She tried to sit down in my lap when I was standing up.\" The screenplay was written around the Hays Code, the censorship policy that put restrictions on sexual themes. In the book, Geiger was selling pornography and he was in a gay relationship with his assistant Lundgren. Both selling pornography and references to homosexuality were prohibited. In the novel, Carmen appears nude in two scenes, but in the film, she is fully clothed. A scene that explains the plot towards the end with two characters, the police commissioner and the district attorney, was removed completely from the final version of the film.Prior to The Big Sleep, Howard Hawks directed To Have and Not Have in 1944, starring Humphrey Bogart and Lauren Bacall in her film debut. The chemistry between Bogart and Bacall is just one of many reasons to watch this film. They got married in 1945 when Bacall was 20 and Bogart was 45 and recently divorced. Bogart frequently missed days on set due to his depression and alcoholism following his divorce. They were together until Bogart's death in 1957.The film was pre-released in 1945 but was revised and re-released in 1946 for a few reasons. Bacall's agent, Charles K. Feldman, requested many of Bacall's scenes to be re-shot in order to capture the chemistry between her and Bogart. The famous racehorse scene was added solely for that purpose. Many of Martha Vickers' scenes were removed to boost Bacall's performance.The Big Sleep is a film noir well worth seeing. The plot allows the audience to piece the puzzle together with clues that can be interpreted depending on how you see it. It heavily influenced The Coen Brothers to create the 1998 cult classic, The Big Lebowski. I highly recommend The Big Sleep to adults and fans of film noir.4/4",

What makes a great crime noir is to develop a storyline that is not only hard for us to decipher who did what, but the characters as well. I love the feeling of unraveling what really happened along with the characters. It's probably one of the main reasons why I love private detective films. Humphrey Bogart was one of the biggest movie stars the world had ever seen. But to be honest, I'm not entirely sure he would be able to figure out the complete plot of The Big Sleep. It's an intricate story about a private detective who gets brought onto a case for one reason, and then ends up finding out 15 million other things he should solve.Lauren Bacall stars alongside Bogart, as a somewhat romantic interest? The reason I say that is that there are so many double crosses and mysteries involving each character that it becomes difficult to understand each characters motivations. But Bacall brings such charm and charisma the screen even at a very young age. If I'm not mistaken she was only 22 when she filmed this movie. There's something to be said about the vulnerability and maturity she brings to this character that makes her so compelling. Bogart on the other hand is incredibly slick and experienced. It's a nice balance to have in a crime drama because when a someone does something uncharacteristic it makes it that much more interesting.As much as I love the females in this film, I have learned not to trust anyone in film-noir's and in particular the ladies. I'm not going to pretend I understand everything in The Big Sleep but I do know they leave it on enough of a cliffhanger to make me doubt several things with Bacall's character. But there are so many characters in general in The Big Sleep that I could just be getting confused with another blackmail or who wants to get who killed scenario. The great thing about the film though is it's re-watchability. I feel like I still have a whole lot to learn when it comes to this story. Which is another reason why I hope to see them eventually remake this classic. Not that I'm always for a remake, I'm not. But I do feel like one starring Bradley Cooper and Jennifer Lawrence would be quite good.+Star power +Bacalls maturity at such a young age +Makes you pay attention +Engaging plot (page turner if you will) -Perhaps too many characters 8.3/10",

            "content": "The Big Sleep, regarded as one of the greatest noirs of movie history, had a production almost as complicated as the its plot, adapted, and softened in order to meet the draconian censorship of the Hays Code, from the 1939 Raymond Chandler's novel with the same title, that gave birth to the Philip Marlowe character.Finished in 1945, then subject to major reshooting to give more depth and breadth to Lauren Bacall's character and, particularly, to her romance with Humphrey Bogart, The Big Sleep was eventually released in 1946, conveniently few months after the wedding of its two leading actors.As widely known, the plot is baroque to say the least and Hollywood legend has that the very Raymond Chandler, asked by director Howard Hawks about some of the story's nexuses, was not able to explain them!\nHowever, the crafted direction of Howard Hawks is able to keep the viewer's attention always alive, subtly moving the centre of gravity of the movie from the developments of the criminal story to the developments of the attraction between Vivian Rutledge, played by Lauren Bacall at her fourth movie after her debut, still a teen-ager and under the direction of her Pygmalion Howard Hawks, in To Have and To Have Not, where she met the man, twenty five years older, at his third marriage and already a bright star, with whom she will form one of the most legendary Hollywood couples, in life and on screen, and that here plays Philip Marlowe, another sophisticated performance of Humphrey Bogart, as usual unrivalled in blending an abrasive harshness with an irrepressible empathy.The movie, although interesting for its multi-leads narrative built as a sort of matrioska of crime and rotten humanity, does not hide, even from its launching trailers, how much it is focused on the two leading actors and it banks on their close-ups and their intense, sexually charged, bickering, most often a truly witty and lively dialogue, without paying too much attention to clarify, not even at the end, what really happened: in the original version a scene where Inspector Bernie Ohls, a good Regis Toomey, and Philip Marlowe go together over the facts, explaining them for the benefit of the most likely still puzzled audience, has been sacrificed in the final cut to make more room for Lauren Bacall and her relationship with Bogart.Notwithstanding these patent commercial tricks, the movie had undoubtedly represented a milestone\nIn the history of the classic film noir: while the film is not particularly innovative, neither in the structure nor in the camerawork, the performance of Bogart, already a big star in Hollywood, creates another icon of the private detective character, cynic yet deeply human: even if others have played both Sam Spade and Philip Marlow, The Maltese Falcon and The Big Sleep have linked them unavoidably to Humphrey Bogart's facial expression.A movie that every film buff should watch and that, even after many years, has aged very well and has been able to remain interesting and filmically attractive, well beyond the advertised romance of Humphrey Bogart and Lauren Bacall.",

            "content": "Spoilers near the end! My advice is to meet with this gently, have no thought what it's about, let the burden of names and trifle detail flow through you. Use it like you were calibrating the eye to focus.By itself the film is uninteresting and not really worth the energy required to investigate. On the page, I suppose the situation to have been somehow mitigated by Chandler's wit and prose but the plot is all of it disposable. If I kept on the right track, we have three sets of blackmail, six counts of murder, plus a seventh revealed near the end, and all sorts of trickery, fronts, and storymaking between players. But two sets of unconnected circumstances elevate this to something that is required viewing and working with.The Hays Code was one, a simple effect; none of Chandler's titillation about drugs and pornography could ever reach the big screen, so all the sex is staged between a camera concealed inside a statue and us getting to imagine about it. It works better than if it were explicit.The second one is even more incidental, a boozing Faulkner had shown up from Mississippi to write for the movies. Now I don't presume the finished script was either fully by design or by complete lack of it, since Faulkner didn't care beyond a paycheck, rather the result of handing out Chandler's hard and thin sense of reality to a literary giant of the most awesomely intuitive nature, capable for the most multilayered memory. Add to that reshoots of the film several months later, sexual innuendo between Bacall/Bogart spliced in, a key scene where Marlowe explains the plot left on the cutting room floor, and you already have enough pieces of the puzzle missing.Or what I call the Ambersons Effect, after the Welles film. This a situation where no writer is in full control of the complicated story originally intended, quite clearly in our case. The famous story is that Chandler had to be phoned back to shed some light on the cluster of murders.So we get a twist on Chandler's twist of the story, but following Marlowe's assembly of that story, the culprit is shot to pieces before we have a chance to corroborate. We leave the film thinking Marlowe got it right, had to.Here's where the world of allusive accidents kicks into effect.The framing device, this is where Carmen was going to be framed for murder, is a set of photos and a daze that makes her as a viewer susceptible to stories! Isn't this us?Chandler used sex and drugs to explain but that is gone. We just have the mystifying stupor, the girl drowsy in a Chinese dress. We have the concealed camera.We have Marlowe's coolly laid-out solution to the story, after the old blueprint of detective fiction - Holmes, Perry Mason, the mode that Chandler wrote in - so quite independent of the viewer. His snappy rat-ta-tat as he explains is followed moments later by the staccato sound of machine-gun fire that kills off the only one who could say if it was so.But upon reflection, the thing seems a bit off, ordinary logic broken in the process, this creates strangely ambiguous perturbations through a world we just experienced as rational and finite. Marlowe's story is near as possible as everyone else's, but the entire film leading up to it has been believable stories exposed as fabrication. The alternative reading I prefer, is that Marlowe solves blackmail but in doing so suspects he may have fallen for the wrong woman. So he investigates a second plot that is stories made-up by this woman to guard herself, in the end he unspools this in the only way where she turns out innocent and his instincts right all along.This is great the way we have it, a lesson in the relative dynamics of storytelling. When Marlowe resurfaces for The Long Goodbye, the world has outmaneuevered him in complexity. There is a boozing writer and shown to be destructive. The link is Leigh Brackett.",

Believe me, if you haven't seen The Big Sleep then you haven't seen the most intelligent detective film ever. Perhaps, the most complicated mystery film ever written and joining it are the most powerful dialogues ever written for any detective film. And who else could do it better than Humphrey Bogart? Legend Humphrey Bogart as Detective is unbeatable and he deserves this kind of master storytelling. Earlier I thought The Maltese Falcon was his Best Detective film ever but now i feel that we got a challenger. Yes, you heard it. The Maltese Falcon still stands in my list because it was a pioneer of the detective films but it was a simple film, a brilliant one though. To be more precise, it was first ever achievement so it might have not been that simple looking in 1941. But believe me The Big Sleep has more suspense, more complexes and more of everything you expect from a detective film. There is no stopping for the film from the first frame till the last. The pace is break-less, screenplay is tight, the writing is top notch. There is love, there is betrayal, there is flirting, there is coolness, there is hot weather, there is triumph and there is perfect ending. The detective Mr. Marlowe played by Bogart is genius, he's mastermind but towards the end we realise that he's kind and a normal human being too. Lauren Bacall as semi villain and leading actress is fantastic but she looks so macho sometimes. Howard Honks deserves special praise because he delivered such a seamless and handsome thrilling film for all detective film lovers. The Big Sleep is confusing and full of conflicts but that's the stuff a movie buff wants to see of one has got brain. An ordinary thriller would never give so much of chills as The Big Sleep gives. Just don't miss it. If you call yourself a movie buff or a thriller lover then you just can't afford to miss The Big Sleep. A Classic !Rating- 8/10*",

Their mere presence, alone, does not a great movie make.As much as I like Bogie in his prime, and respected Bacall in hers, the magic that they made in \"To Have And Have Not\", \"Dark Passage\", and \"Key Largo\" just isn't that evident here.And, in terms of plot, this one rambles, and even the studio felt major improvements needed to be made to make the film appealing to post-war audiences.Now, that's not to say it's a bad film. It's a good film. But, just a \"good\" film. Not a \"great\" film\".For example, in the house where the primary murder takes place...would Phillip Marlowe really leave his finger prints all over every key piece of evidence? Not if he was a good detective.Would everyone be continually going in and out of the murder house like it was a hotel lobby? I doubt it.Humphrey Bogart is good here...his character sure of himself...with some clever patter to go along with it. Lauren Bacall is good, but not sultry as she is in some other pairings with Bogart, and her character doesn't seem to know which side of her bread is buttered. Martha Vickers, as a foolish young lady, didn't impress. Regis Toomey as a police inspector once again proves he was a dependable character actor. Charles Waldron as the old man trying to protect his family was an interesting character. Louis Heydt has an interesting scene as a somewhat shady guy who isn't as clever as he thinks, and isn't tough enough, either. Elisha Cook is around for a while, but not in the tough role we saw in \"The Maltese Falcon\". I wish we would have seen more of Dorothy Malone here...very promising scenes that I understand were cut back because she was getting more attention than Lauren Bacall.Another problem with this film is that there are just too many characters to keep them all straight. Sort of like when you get halfway through a book and wish you'd started writing the characters down to keep them all straight.It's not that this is a bad movie. It's good...but not great. It's always interesting watching Humphrey Bogart. A marvelous actor. I recommend watching this movie, but I think the 8 point + rating on IMDb is too high.",

In the book, Marlowe finds Carmen at Geiger's house with Geiger dead on the floor and Carmen sitting in a chair stark naked. She's been posing for porn photos-the photos that in the movie are sent to Vivian by Brody to blackmail her. It is amusing to imagine such a fuss, drawn guns and all, over photos of a fully clothed Carmen, but that's what the production code did to these scenes. In the later scene where Carmen sneaks into Marlowe's apartment, she is again supposed to be naked-but not in the movie. The annoying gunsel, Carol Lundgren,in the book, constantly uses a familiar profanity,leading Marlowe to observe that he doesn't have much of a vocabulary. Carmen, in the book, tries to shoot Marlowe, but (spoiler warning!) wets her pants! The book doesn't really help to understand who killed Owen, the chauffeur. If Brody did it, how did he get back to Geiger's place in time to remove the body?",

            "content": "I first saw The Big Sleep (1946) one night at the uni when I was doing my Masters. The plot is crazily confusing. Half an hour into the film I was a goner and I remembered looking around at others to see who was still following the story. Over the weekend I decided to try it again; this time with the wifey. I figured it should be easy peasy for me and I gave my wife a friendly warning. One hour later I was again a goner after yet another name drop and a dead body. The only thing that really got to me was the animalistic sexy chemistry between Bogart and Bacall. When the movie closed with a frame of their faces turning towards each other, I turned to my wifey and ranted a spirited barrage about how nobody could understand the incomprehensible plot. She turned to me with a befuddled look and said \"what's so difficult about that?\" I thought she must be trying to pull a fast one on me and I asked her to give me a rundown. She then in very succinct sentences told me what the whole thing was about. My eyes widened and my jaw dropped. She was absolutely correct! I am useless. Anyway, The Big Sleep is the quintessential American noir - An unreliable protagonist, a femme fatale, shady characters and nihilistic atmosphere, they are all here. Coupled with a piling on of important information, this was the Inception of its time. I love Bogart who essentially plays his character the same way as all his other iconic roles - sexist and insolent. The lines are amazing stuff:Philip Marlowe: She tried to sit in my lap while I was standing up.Vivian: What will your first step be? Philip Marlowe: The usual one. Vivian: I didn't know there was a usual one. Philip Marlowe: Well sure there is, it comes complete with diagrams on page 47 of how to be a detective in 10 easy lessons correspondent school textbook and uh, your father offered me a drink. Vivian: You must've read another one on how to be a comedian.Vivian: You go too far, Marlowe. Marlowe: Those are harsh words to throw at a man, especially when he's walking out of your bedroom.Vivian: So you do get up, I was beginning to think you worked in bed like Marcel Proust. Marlowe: Who's he? Vivian: You wouldn't know him, a French writer. Marlowe: Come into my boudoir.Marlowe: You know what he'll do when he comes back? Beat my teeth out, then kick me in the stomach for mumbling.Taxi Driver: If you can use me again sometime, call this number. Philip Marlowe: Day and night? Taxi Driver: Uh, night's better. I work during the day.This next one is my fave. If you can't catch the sexual innuendo you have no business watching movies. Vivian: Speaking of horses, I like to play them myself. But I like to see them workout a little first, see if they're front runners or come from behind, find out what their hole card is, what makes them run. Marlowe: Find out mine? Vivian: I think so. Marlowe: Go ahead. Vivian: I'd say you don't like to be rated. You like to get out in front, open up a little lead, take a little breather in the backstretch, and then come home free. Marlowe: You don't like to be rated yourself. Vivian: I haven't met anyone yet that can do it. Any suggestions? Marlowe: Well, I can't tell till I've seen you over a distance of ground. You've got a touch of class, but I don't know how, how far you can go. Vivian: A lot depends on who's in the saddle.Isn't that incredibly sassy? Such class in writing (which I hardly see in today's films) and every time Bogart and Bacall shared the screen together I thought the temperature in the room went up. The movie also has a very interesting history. It was actually competed before 1946 but kept on shelf as the studios rushed out their WWII patriotic films. Then Bacall's star got tarnished by Confidential Agent (1945), her second film. Her agent looked at the completed The Big Sleep and suggested to Howard Hawks to make changes to protect his investment and the film. So a few years after the film was completed, and by this time Bacall has become Mrs Bogart, the whole team reshot key scenes and inserted some new dialogue (the \"horses\" scene was added at this time) and we got the familiar 1946 version that plays on the incendiary Bogart/Bacall chemistry which became a winner. The documentary in my DVD explains the changes in both versions and it is essential viewing. Lots of stuff have been written about original directors' cuts and purists always swear by them. In this particular instance the retooled version is hands down the supreme version.",

            "content": "The Big Sleep is one of the all-time classics of film-noir. The film is great fun, following Humphrey Bogart's Phillip Marlowe from scene to scene as he unravels the plot's mystery.The film's scenario is good, and the dialogue is great, however the screenplay fails to adequately express the plot. Marlowe will often tell other characters his conclusions without ever having it be explained how he deduced them, and many aspects of the story are left open. It is never explained who killed Owen Taylor (was it Joe or was it a suicide), or, more unforgivably, who killed Sean Regan, the action which is responsible for the entire plot of the film. Eddie Mars claims that Carmen killed Regan, but Marlowe then disproves this by asking him why neither Eddie nor Carmen recognized each other when meeting at Geiger's place the day after Geiger's murder. As well, how would Eddie have proved this to Vivian sufficiently that she would go through all of this trouble to protect Eddie?? It's also been posited that Eddie killed Regan, but if that were the case, why would Vivian believe that Carmen was the killer?? Either way, the keystone which support the entire plot is faulty, a big problem for any film, but combined with the dense plot and the lack of explanation for Marlowe's deduction, this makes for an very weak screenplay.Making up for the weak screenplay is the direction itself, which keeps one engrossed in the latest situation which Marlowe finds himself in, as well as Humphrey Bogart himself, whose screen charisma is the film's greatest strength. Lauren Bacall isn't much of an actress at her best, and this early in her career this was even more true. Martha Vickers was much better as Carmen Sternwood, unfortunately her role was shrunk in order to give more screen time to Bacall. The supporting pieces do very nicely (especially Elisha Cooks Jr., one of my favourite character actors of the era), and the below the line work is excellent, particularly Max Steiner's score.Despite the gaping wholes in the screenplay's construction, this film is Hollywood gold. Pure entertainment from the era that did it best. No matter how much I nitpick, it's still a great product of a great era in film history. I can't give it full marks because of those complaints, but definitely a must-watch film.",

            "review_title": "Probably one of Bogart's best movies",
            "content": "The Big Sleep is a classic detective movie in the film noir style. My friend claims that this is the best film ever made. I wouldn't go that far, though it is tempting, but this movie I believe is a work of art. There are actually two versions of this film, one where the plot is clear while the actual 114 minute version in which the relationship between Phillip Marlowe (Humphrey Bogart) and Vivian Rutledge (Lauren Becall) is emphasised. It is this second version that was released and it is the more popular version. Unfortunately the plot does suffer, but I will try to outline what actually happens.Marlowe is summoned by a rich general because his daughter is being blackmailed. His former detective has left town so the general must turn elsewhere for help. Marlowe accepts the job and trails the blackmailer Mr Geiger who is murdered. The case is closed and Marlowe is paid, but he knows there is something deeper. The general's younger daughter is at the house and at Geiger's bookshop, which is really a front for a pornography ring, some guy is cleaning out the rear. All the evidence points to this guy, but as Marlowe digs deeper he learns that it is not, and this guy is shot before he can get anymore answers. This then leads Marlowe to follow up Geiger's landlord, who also runs a gambling house. Unfortunately the motivation for the murder is lost, and the plot is claimed to be so twisted that the original author of the book simply says, \"the butler did it.\" The Big Sleep is about appearances and keeping yourself shut of from the world. All of the conversations within the movie seem to have two layers. There is the visible layer yet there is another layer which is trying to undermine the recipient of the conversation. Though guns are deadly in this film, and a number of people are killed, it is the art of conversation which creates the powerful people in the film, and Marlowe is one of the most powerful.All of the main characters in the film have a dark, flawed side to them. Marlowe was described by one person as being incorruptible, but I disagree; this issue is not raised in the film. We know there is a dark side to Marlowe, but he hides it very successfully. We know that he is covering himself out for he only lets Vivian in a little way: even though there is a electric passion between them. We do know that Marlowe was sacked from the District Attourney's office due to insubordination, but beyond that we have no clue as to who or what he is.Marlowe is a loner. He works by himself and lives by himself. He does start to form a relationship with Vivian, but this is a shallow relationship where both parties try to protect themselves from their secrets, and this is displayed as the best one can get. The Big Sleep is noir so the dark side of humanity does play a role. The movie is not a tragic movie, but there is a lot of senselessness in it. The death of the guy tailing Marlowe is seen as being a pointless death, and it is one that constantly sits in Marlowe's mind. We constantly are reminded about the brutality of the death because \"he was a good kid.\" Marlowe met him only once, but that one meeting was enough to let him know that the kid was harmless. Thus Marlowe makes the death of Geiger's landlord just as pointless. We know that he is behind everything in the movie, but at this point Marlowe is not interested I answers, he simply wants to see the guilty pay for their crimes, and they do.The ending of the Big Sleep is not conclusive, and I don't think it is meant to be. Everything is chaotic and twisted and we have trouble following what is really happening, and I feel that this is the purpose of the movie. Everything moves through the movie quite fast, and we will arrive at a point where we think everything has been resolved only to find we have gone off in the wrong direction. In the end, the frustration simply rises to the point where the games end and the shooting begins, yet all the while Marlowe's hands remain clean, \"he's just been shot by his boys,\" Marlowe says on the phone.Even then, Marlowe is a master manipulator. Throughout the movie, Vivian's Younger sister Carmen does not know who he is. The name he first gives her is not his real name and she persists with this name right through. Yet he sees through to he flirtatious nature and misleads her with the name because he knows anything between them is simply going to be just as misleading. The phone scene to the police station is just as manipulating as Marlowe turns the call from being a report of a crime to a crank played against the police, but this phone call is also reveals that Vivian is not a lady that is going to be led around by Marlowe. She has resolve and will stand up to Marlowe when necessary.The Big Sleep is a superb movie which vividly portrays the darkness and the chaotic nature of this world. It is one where the characters protect themselves, yet are revealed to be vulnerable, and it is one of deceit and manipulation. Blackmail is rife and people will pay up rather than bring about police involvement. Murder is common yet brutality has a price. It is a superb movie and worth every minute of it.",

Riddled with snappy and memorable dialog, it is great to watch the pair interact.

The plot is pretty muddled (even Chandler himself didn't know who killed one character!) but I don't think anyone really cares because the end result is so damn entertaining. In fact I don't think the basic blackmail plot is even all that interesting, 'Farewell My Lovely' (the book) is much better in my opinion, with more original twists and characters.  The reason this movie is so much fun can be summed up in three words - Bogie and Bacall. They are just a fantastic duo, with lots of on screen chemistry, and trade some classic lines (not surprising with both William Faulkner and SF pulp legend Leigh Brackett among the writers). Bacall looks totally stunning and her on screen sister Martha Vickers is very easy on the eye also (something Michael Winner's misguided 1970s remake really botched). I don't think Bogart is cerebral enough to play Philip Marlowe, but I'm willing to overlook it in this case. I prefer Dick Powell's Marlowe in 'Murder, My Sweet'. I don't think 'The Big Sleep' is as outstanding as others 1940s Noir classics like 'Out Of The Past' and 'Double Indemnity', but for sheer entertainment value it's hard to beat. If you like detective stories you're in for a treat. 'The Big Sleep' is one of the most entertaining movies of its type.",

            "content": "Yes, the plot is incredibly convoluted, but so was the source material. In fact, they say that Hawks contacted Chandler directly to find out who killed Owen Taylor, the Sternwoods' chauffeur, and even Chandler couldn't figure it out. I am convinced that it was Joe Brody.I will not repeat what the other commentators have said, but I think that the best scene of all has been largely overlooked. Bogart grilling Joe Brody (Louis Jean Heydt) about his activities during the evening of Arthur Gwynn Geiger's murder. Brody squirming in his seat desperately trying to avoid eye contact with Marlowe as Marlowe follows him around the couch saying \"Try looking at me, Joe.\"A couple of great lines were also omitted from the list of great lines at the beginning of the thread.Eddie Mars pulls a gun on Marlowe and says, \"Do you mind?\" Marlowe: \"No, I'm used to it.\"Mars to Marlowe: \"Open the door.\" Marlowe: \"Open it yourself. I've already got a client.\"Brody to Marlowe: \"I guess you think I'm dumb, huh?\" Marlowe: \"Just average for a grafter.\"Plus the traditional Hawks overlapping dialogue in which Agnes twice says, \"He gives me a pain in my ---,\" and each time she is interrupted before she can finish the sentence.There are two ways to make more sense of the incomprehensible plot. One is to read the novel; the other is to see the far inferior remake. For example, both explain what happened to Sean Regan (\"Rusty Regan\" in the book) while this version does not.In the book, Carmen sneaks into Marlowe's apartment and is waiting in his bed in the raw when he returns. However, he resists her offer and throws her out causing her to become unhinged. Marlowe figures out that the same thing happened when Regan refused her advances and that she killed him because Carmen does not like being told \"no\". This is impossible to figure out from the 1945 version, probably because of the Code that was in effect at the time.I agree that Bogart's Marlowe and Spade are totally different characters. Sam Spade was a pure reflection of John Houston. Tough, hardboiled, sardonic, dismissive of women, totally in charge, and laden with a sense of vague morality at best.By contrast. Bogart's Marlowe is a far more realistic, less glamorized, version of the private eye: Ex-DA investigator; knowledgeable about things that only cops know; a lone wolf with his own code of morality; and the desire to do the right thing barely hidden under a veneer of cynicism and world weariness.Also, even though only 3 years elapsed between the making of the \"Falcon\" and \"The Big Sleep,\" Bogie aged dramatically in those three years.This movie truly has it all: vintage 40's noir; the Bogart-Bacall mystique; superb supporting performers; an engrossing mystery populated with intriguing characters; and a marvelous capturing of the feel of old L.A.This one should be firmly ensconced in everyone's all time Top 10.",

            "review_title": "Pure Noir",
            "content": "This is pure noir. A guy, a femme fatale, and a mystery that twists and turns in every dizzying direction. Anchored by Raymond Chandler's novel and a screenplay by William Faulkner, Leigh Brackett and Jules Furthman, Howard Hawks delivers a wildly entertaining descent into the Los Angeles underworld as it touches upon one fractured wealthy family and Philip Marlowe, the private investigator sent out to figure out why the family is being blackmailed. Roger Ebert described the movie as being about process instead of results, and I think that's an apt description. This is about the steps that Marlowe has to take to untangle the mystery. The actual mystery ends up feeling secondary. That the movie ends up so compelling is a testament to every piece of the puzzle that got used.Humphrey Bogart's Marlowe is called to the large estate of General Sternwood, an aged man of wealth who began a family late in life, having two daughters. The eldest, Lauren Bacall's Vivian, is married to a man named Rutledge who has disappeared from her life. The younger of the two, Martha Vickers' Carmen, is a wild young thing who instantly begins to play with Marlowe the second he's in the door, playing up her attractiveness for the older man. The General is concerned, you see, because right after his body man, Sean Regan, he's received a threat of blackmail around Carmen's gambling debts, and he doesn't want to pay it. Instead, he'll have Marlowe investigate into who's sending the note, and getting them to stop.His first direction takes him to an antique book shop. After a bit of research into some rare books, he puts on an act and discovers that the woman manning the counter in the shop doesn't actually know that much about rare books. He needs to see the man behind the operation, A. G. Geiger, staking the place out with a cute girl in another bookshop across the street, until he can follow Geiger to his house. Soon after, Carmen arrives in her car. Marlowe watches until there's some gunshots, a scream, someone running away, and Geiger dead on his own floor with Carmen high as a kite in a chair next to him with a hidden camera, its film gone, obviously having documented something. Well, this mystery just started going deeper.Recounting the intricate steps that take Marlowe all around Los Angeles would be pointless. Instead, what's important is Marlowe himself. He's the quintessential noir hero, and Bogart plays him perfectly. Sardonic, cynical, smart, and tough, Marlowe is a man with a mission. He is willing to go as far as possible to figure out the mystery at the heart of the Sternwood, even after the General has told him he's done enough. Part of that is the femme Vivian Rutledge. It wouldn't be a Bogart and Bacall movie if the two didn't share some steamy romance, and The Big Sleep is no different from To Have and Have Not in that regard. Vivian may still be technically married, but her close approximation to Marlowe is going to draw them together and provide Marlow with the hook on which to get caught into the deeper mystery around her family.One of the reasons that the mystery around the film works so well is the incredibly strong sense of perspective. The entire film is told from Marlowe's perspective. He's in every scene and in about 90% of the film's shots. I'm regularly annoyed by films that play fast and loose with perspective, denying us insight into actions we should be able to see because of whom we're following (David Lean's Madeleine comes to mind). That's not a problem here. We see everything through Marlowe's eyes. When murders happen outside of his perspective, we know as little as he does about who did it. When murders happen in front of him, we see those, being invited to connect all the dots that he's connecting at the same time. It's a challenge for the audience to keep up because the mystery is so intricate that it would take a private detective like Marlowe to sort through it.This is really just primo entertainment from a group of extremely talented people. This is kind of an idealized example of film noir, anchored by a wonderful performance from Bogart and confidently and deftly directly by Hawks.",

            "content": "Who killed Owen Taylor, the replacement chauffeur? I don't know; Philip Marlowe doesn't know; screenwriters William Faulkner, Leigh Brackett and Jules Furthman certainly don't know. Indeed, even Raymond Chandler, the author of the original novel, was once asked to explain his story's many murders, double-crossings, twists and turns, and replied that he had absolutely no idea. In any other situation, I might consider this a solid detraction from the quality of the film, but, strangely enough, here it almost acts as a positive. 'The Big Sleep (1946)' is so doggedly obsessed with showing us the dark, seedy underbelly of human existence that any scenario, however shocking, is quite conceivable; the murderer could have been any one of the characters, and this would have been wholly consistent with the general tone of the film. The Hollywood township setting is occupied by a collection of the most morally-depraved creatures imaginable, and the murder mystery plot is so incredibly convoluted that anybody who claims to follow it all on first viewing is either a genius or a liar.Humphrey Bogart is, of course, the definitive version of the film-noir hero, exhibiting handsomeness, toughness and always remaining in full control of the situation. Though his character is basically the same as his Sam Spade from 'The Maltese Falcon (1941),' this was the only occasion on which Bogart portrayed Chandler's popular character Philip Marlowe {who, notably, has also been played by Dick Powell and Robert Mitchum}. Though Marlowe is allowed to entertain a variety of seductive women, via some surprisingly-scandalous double entendre dialogue, it is with future-wife Lauren Bacall that the chemistry really sizzles {the couple would be married by the time of the film's release, and would co-star in numerous subsequent pictures}. Considering I had been rather disappointed with the pair's chemistry in 'Key Largo (1948),' it was a real pleasure to witness the sparks really flying this time, most memorably in a sexually-suggestive horse-racing dialogue sequence, which was re-shot later to capitalise on the pair's popularity following 'To Have and Have Not (1944).''The Big Sleep' is one of the most rawly-entertaining hard-boiled detective thrillers I've seen, an indecipherable jumble of murders and low-lifes that both acknowledges its incomprehensibility and accepts it {indeed, the characters each seem as baffled as we are}. Various important characters never appear on screen, while others turn up already dead, and more still only survive long enough to divulge a vital clue. Considering the dominance of the Productive/Hays Code during the 1940s, it's surprising that much of the content of the film was allowed to remain intact. Aside from the sexual innuendo, the plot also contains veiled references to pornography, drug use and homosexuality. Perhaps the film's ultra-complicated plot also served as the picture's saving grace, with censors apparently too bewildered with the mystery to notice what was actually being implied by Bogart and his various female companions. However, the one most important question has yet to be asked: where on Earth did Howard Hawks manage to find so many good-lookin' dames?!",

Long may she remain so.Bogart and Bacall are great together, although in truth he's a little mechanical in some scenes in the movie. She, on the other hand, is always on the go, as is Martha Vickers as her off-kilter sister - a terrific, rather disturbing performance. And Charles Waldron, as the sisters' father, is equally though very differently splendid in his final film role, carrying the opening expository scene on his frail shoulders.It's a great pleasure to revisit this movie, so for those who have yet to see it, hurry, so you can see it again as soon as possible.RIP Betty Joan Perske.",

He has 2 daughters - Lauren Bacall (Vivian) and Martha Vickers (Carmen) - and it transpires that they are both drawn to the thrill of danger. Bogart solves one case but is then hooked into sticking around and poking his nose into other situations which seem to have been lurking around for a while. He is not welcome.This film is nicely shot, for instance, the depth in the greenhouse-type room where Bogart meets with Waldron draws you into the house. The dialogue is snappy and funny (both Bacall and Vickers tell Bogart that he is short) and sustains a consistency throughout the whole story. However, the film is slightly too long and I can understand those who think the film a little over-complicated. I was able to follow about 90%but I had to concentrate for the full 1 hour and 54 minutes, and this is quite a demand on the viewer. The story just seems to keep going, so just run with it.The cast are all effective and Lauren Bacall sings a really cool song after 1 hour when we see her in the nightclub and we realize, for the first time, that she is also a problem girl. Up to that point, Vickers is the bad girl who is always getting into trouble. You wonder what will happen in the final confrontations and I am pleased to say that the ending wasn't the clich\u00e9 that I was expecting given the title of the film. I have no idea what the title means.Overall, it's a bit complicated but make an effort with it and it's not bad.

His plotlines are often complex bordering on the incomprehensible.Humphrey Bogart and Lauren Bacall made three pictures with each other during the 40's. \"To have and have not\" (1944, Howards Hawks) was the first one, and during this film they became engaged. \"The big sleep\" (1946, Howard Hawks) was the second one and during this film they were already married.Howard Hawks is a director with broad experience in the screwball genre (for example \"Bringing up Baby\", 1938). Film noir being about physical violence between man and man and screwball being about verbal violence between man and woman, Hawks manages to make a good mix of these two genres in \"The big sleep\".The production company had the impression that the chemistry between Bogart and Bacall was sometimes a bit less fierce than in \"To have and have not\". Because of this they decided to reshoot some of the scenes. An additional argument for this was that there were a lot of finished war films in stock. The production company was in a hurry to release them as soon as possible, assuming that soon the interest in war films would fade away. It is odd to read this argument in 2021, having just seen a recent war film (\"The forgotten batlle, 2020, Matthijs van Heijningen jr) just a week ago.",

            "content": "\"The Big Sleep\" is generally regarded as one of the very best Films Noirs - although, as many people quite rightly point out, many of the typical 'Noir' features are missing here. No dirty back streets, no heavy shadow effects, no desperate protagonist; and yet, the ESSENCE of Film Noir is there, more tangible maybe than even in most of the 'typical' Noirs: a degenerate world of crime and sex, characters cynical, mean, or mentally ill - it's one of 'tough novel' writer Raymond Chandler's great character studies, brought to the screen with absolute perfection, and with an absolutely fitting cast.I don't think it's of any use trying to explain the plot revolving around blackmail, love affairs and murder; insiders (and most fans as well) know that it's probably the most twisted one in film history - even Chandler himself didn't know who killed the chauffeur, for example. He just didn't care very much about the actual plot; he wanted to develop some very unique characters - and he certainly accomplished that. And ALL of the actors who played in the film adaptation certainly brought those characters to life! With first and best, of course, the protagonists, Humphrey Bogart and Lauren Bacall...As we know, they'd fallen in love with each other during the shooting of \"To Have and Have Not\"; it was obvious from the beginning that their chemistry was just PERFECT both on and off screen. When \"The Big Sleep\" was made in 1944/45, there still was the problem of Bogart's marriage, and it was a difficult time for the lovers, because Lauren Bacall literally had to FIGHT for her man - but she finally won, and they married soon after the end of the shooting. Now you could say that's only of interest for romantic Bogey&Bacall fans like me - but the private struggle clearly shows in the ups and downs of the relationship of the movie characters, private eye Philip Marlowe and rich, spoiled Vivian Rutledge. Some scenes were added later (that's why the movie finally got released in 1946), like the 'racing horses dialog'; which Bogey and Bacall did with the ease and obvious enjoyment of a perfectly happy couple who has left their worries behind - although their characters hadn't accomplished that in the movie yet, of course...Seen purely as a film, \"The Big Sleep\" certainly ranks among the best Films Noirs - maybe it doesn't QUITE reach the class of \"The Maltese Falcon\" or \"Double Indemnity\", but it's a perfectly written, perfectly directed, and perfectly acted, dark and tough murder story, one of the great Classics, no doubt.",

Steele does a good job in playing him, it's not that, but it was a waste of his talents to play this clich\u00e9. Still, it's what sells to the psychopaths of today.Fortunately, the psychopath isn't the stereotype of the \"superman sadist\", and he isn't depicted as superhuman. He isn't as immortal as a modern day moron would make him. Most of the movie is about Bogart's character. A landmark scene involves him with two other landmark actors (including Steele), where he timidly watches a murder. The events that follow tell a lot about his character.And that's the highlight of the movie, the character of our hero. He is not perfect, but he is far from the one dimensional clich\u00e9 of the psychopathic sixties and seventies movie characters who were declared \"anti heroes\" by every brain fried dope-head who inspired Beavis and Butthead. No, here we have a true anti hero. He at least struggles to make reason of a situation.It's hard to say whether it is directing or acting that makes Bogie shine. He was at his best when portraying imperfect people, in the Sierra Madre, in a black Legion, in here. He's flawed, and makes mistakes, but they're very human ones. Maybe he had the best agent ever, or maybe he was just that great, or maybe both. Whatever, he makes this worth watching.",

Case in point is that there are at least two, if not three suspects who are absent from the screen, but figure prominently in detective Philip Marlowe's case. More over, Humphrey Bogart, for the benefit of getting into his own character, curiously asked director Howard Hawks as to who killed one baddie in question, whose long, black car was pulled out of the bay early in the film. Hawks confessed he had no idea. He, in turn, picked up the slack and asked screenwriter William Faulkner, who said he did not know! Finally he asked author Raymond Chandler --who quipped the \"butler\" did it, but that was simply not true! Hawks requested that Warner Brothers add a little more money to the budget, at least for one scene to clarify who killed who. Jack Warner said it would be a waste of money! After all, audiences of the day came to watch Bogey and Bacall! The move paid off. Maybe all the cigarette smoke had something to do with it! The dark, moody atmosphere, add the crickets(!), the witty dialogue, not to mention some neat double-talk, put this one way over the top, and it still keeps on paying dividends. A classic whodunit that couldn't figure itself out, but with the legendary Bogey and Bacall, well... perhaps... that's all that really matters.

All you have to know is there is an element of crime thriving on greed that is dressed up rather respectfully as the main player goes about manipulation. That manipulator is one Eddie Mars. He's a flashy sort running a nightclub fronting his illegal gambling. A fellow the sort of Mars believes he is untouchable and his other main interest is blackmailing the rich. The rich in this case is a old-guard type named Sternwood. Sternwood is vulnerable in that he has two rather ripe for the picking daughters. One nubile youth who craves male attention and another slightly older that can have almost any man yet prefers her Achilles heel of gambling. Mars takes advantage of both daughters and sets us an elaborate blackmail scheme that has worked once in the past so why not go to the well again? While providing the vehicle for the movie the blackmail scheme isn't laid out in a very comprehensible fashion. The bottom-line is this story gets the viewer confused.What delivers an overall great film is the chemistry and excellent acting of Bogart as P.I. Philip Marlowe and Lauren Bacall as his love interest, the eldest daughter of Sternwood. The film is propelled by action in lieu of that aforementioned confusing non-linear plot. The B&W film-noir cinematography doesn't get any better than one will see here. Each scene is crafted well and the period oozes with fine detail. Everyone looks the absolute best in their roles, singularly brilliant casting!. The beautiful women are plentiful with Martha Vickers (the young Carmen Sternwood), Dorothy Malone ( a true grand career entrance for Lauren Bacall as Vivian Sternwood), and the captivating book shop proprietress played compactly and stunningly by the great Dorthy Malone. Of course beyond Bogie we know this exponentially brilliant cast is anchored by the new film ing\u00e9nue Lauren Bacall. Yes, it is said this film was the catalyst for one of the iconic Hollywood true love stories between these two and it blossoms right on screen here.So, one must rate this a solid 8 out of 10 for overall excellence in spite of a story which, many times, just seems not to wholly make sense. This keeps the viewer a bit \"off-balance\" to create a bit of mystery and suspense which does work in the end due to Bogart and Bacall's almost unbelievably strong pairing. It's sometimes comical how Marlowe puts himself in deathly situations only to gain the upper hand coming out barely. Bogart is the only one who could pull this off and not look silly. This is one of the most classic examples of film-noir and, of course, can't be missed - even demanding to be watched repeatedly. Bogart shines, Bacall's star is born and the viewer is rapt within the two. An absolute must see film for everyone.",

            "content": "THE BIG SLEEP has a reputation for being a film that gets lost in its own complexity and which fails to clearly identify all the perpetrators of all the murders that litter its scenes. There is a certain truth to this: like the Raymond Chandler novel on which it is based, the plot is extremely complicated, and it requires the viewer to mentally track an unexpected number of characters--including two characters that never appear on screen, a pivotal character who doesn't actually have any lines, and a character who is frequently mentioned but doesn't appear until near the film's conclusion. There is not, however, as much truth to the accusation that the film never exposes all the killers: only one killer is not specifically identified, but even so his identity is very clearly implied.All this having been said, THE BIG SLEEP is one helluva movie. In general, the story concerns the wealthy Sternwood family, which consists of an aging father and two \"pretty and pretty wild\" daughters--one of whom, Carmen, is being victimized by a blackmailer. P.I. Philip Marlowe is hired to get rid of the blackmailer, but an unexpected murder complicates matters... and touches off a series of killings by a number of parties who have covert interests in the Sternwood family.Perhaps the most amazing thing about the film is that you don't actually have to pick apart the complicated story in order to enjoy it. The script is famous for its witty lines and sleek sexual innuendo--much of it lifted directly from Chandler's novel--and the cast is a dream come true. Philip Marlowe would be played by a great many actors, but none of them ever bested Humphrey Bogart, who splendidly captures the feel of Chandler's original creation; with the role of Vivien Sternwood Lauren Bacall gives what might be the finest performance of her screen career; and the chemistry between the two is everything you've ever heard. The supporting cast is superlative, all the way from Martha Vickers' neurotic turn as Carmen Sternwood to Bob Steele's purring hit-man Canino. There's simply not a false note to be found any where. Although the film really pre-dates the film noir movement the entire look of THE BIG SLEEP anticipates noir to a remarkable degree--it would be tremendously influential--and director Hawks gives everything a sharp edge from start to finish.Two versions of THE BIG SLEEP are included on the DVD: the film as it was originally shot and the film as it was released to theatres in 1946. The actual differences between the two are fairly slight, but they prove significant. Although the original version is somewhat easier to follow in terms of story, it lacks the flash that makes the theatrical version such a memorable experience; it is easy to see why Hawks elected to rescript and reshoot several key scenes as well as add new ones, and both newcomers and old fans will have fun comparing the two. The DVD also includes an enjoyable documentary on the differences between the films and the motivations behind them.I don't usually comment on picture quality unless there is a glaring issue, but several reviewers have noted portions of this print have a flicker or seem a bit washed out. I noticed these problems, but I can't say that they in any way distracted from my enjoyment of the film, and they certainly don't prevent me from recommending it--be it on the big screen, television, video or this DVD. And I recommend it very, very strongly indeed.",

Indeed, this film's wildly twisting plot and superb performances create an overall stunning film. Who better to portray the rough edged Philip Marlowe than the master of the tough guy, Humphrey Bogart. But \"Bogey's\" performance is masterfully balanced with the smooth and silky performance of Lauren Bacall. The chemistry between these two actors isn't entirely fiction, however. Bacall and Bogey were a real life couple, and this film marks the beginning of their relationship. I suggest this film for anyone who is a Raymond Chandler fan, a Humphrey Bogart fan, or simply a fan of good movies.",

Initially hired to make a blackmailer 'go away', he soon finds himself unravelling a much bigger mystery.Much of the film's lasting appeal stems from the Bogie/Bacall pairing. Personally, I think that they have good chemistry but I wouldn't say that it's as exceptional as some seem to think. Bogart's Marlowe is similar to his Sam Spade but here he shows a bit of a lighter touch. Bacall, meanwhile, is extremely fetching and exudes a sultry, seductive aura. The supporting cast is pretty good for the most part but not really worth remarking upon in detail.From a technical standpoint the film is well constructed but not particularly exceptional. The Hawks direction and Steiner score are both solid but I doubt that many consider them the main draws of the picture. The script is quite strong in terms of dialogue but the storyline is undeniably convoluted. I was able to follow it without any problems but you've been advised to pay close attention.In the end, \"The Big Sleep\" makes for an entertaining film noir with some excellent work from Humphrey Bogart.

            "content": "Memorable primarily because of the off-screen as well as on-screen romance of its two stars, and the bewilderment of even those involved with the film in respect to the chaotic and convoluted plot, The Big Sleep stands to this day as one of the most memorable pictures of the film noir movement. By all respects, the film should not have functioned, considering its number of discordant qualities, but somehow everything fits together in a surprisingly functional and sturdy fashion, standing out as one of the most subtly unique and daring films of the decade. Director Howard Hawks demonstrates his typical flair for energy and enthusiasm, and every scene virtually crackles with the fast paced, overlapping dialogue and captivating intensity. And while the infamously convoluted plot is just as ludicrously difficult to follow or make sense of as heralded, it becomes almost inconsequential - when even Chandler admitted to having difficultly figuring out who had murdered who in his own novel, it became quickly clear that not all of The Big Sleep was meant to be understood. Instead of attempting to clarify matters, Hawks cheerfully embraces the convoluted script and pumps the film full of such energy and vivacity that the final effort is too unabashedly enjoyable for one to be concerned with an increasingly trivial plot. And in the end, when the film boasts so much else to relish, such as the sumptuous noir visuals, the aesthetically brilliant sets, and a powerful but never overbearing orchestral score, it becomes increasingly difficult not to enjoy. In contrast with the infinitely twisty and frequently confounding plot, the script itself is a truly masterful work, providing a consistent barrage of snappy, highly quotable lines (many put to brilliant use by Bogart's masterful deadpan delivery) many subtly parodying film noir conventions (\"What's the matter? Haven't you ever seen a gun before?\" is one of the most memorable) and a surprising quantity of comedic moments, nicely counterbalancing the tense tone of the film. Moments one would never expect to see in a classic noir, such as Marlowe portraying a flamboyant literary expert and a very James Bond-like slew of women falling instantly for Marlowe, often with a coy innuendo in pursuit, work surprisingly well, and far from descending the film into farce, maintain an outwardly serious tone with a seeming quiet chuckle carefully masked. Of course the unquestionable high point of the film are the incredibly strong performances, in particular the electric chemistry between Bogart and Bacall. The character of private eye Philip Marlowe could easily have been tailor written for Humphery Bogart, considering the ease with which he sinks his teeth into the role. Bogart is on absolutely top form from start to finish - an iconic blend of gruff charisma, dogged intensity and pitch perfect deadpan delivery easily justifying his legendary status. As one of the few female co-stars who could ever go toe to toe with Bogart in terms of dramatic intensity and charisma, Lauren Bacall is perfectly cast as the mysterious Vivian Rutledge. Her magnetic presence and icy delivery are consistently captivating, and the scenes between her and Bogart tremble with romantic tension it seems impossible could have ceased after the cameras stopped rolling. Backing up the two dynamic leads, John Ridgely is a commanding presence as malevolent casino owner Eddie Mars, and Martha Vickers is captivating and enormously powerful as Bacall's hedonistic sister Carmen. All in all, for those willing to either overlook or put up with the film's sometimes confoundingly complex plot, The Big Sleep proves itself to be one of the most caustically enjoyable entries to the film noir movement. Kinetic, sharp, and incessantly clever, the film exudes class from every frame to the point where matters such as continuity become easily overshadowed by the snappy script and the dynamic performances of Bogart and Bacall. They simply do not make films such as this anymore, and upon subsequent viewing, such a notion becomes increasingly tragic. -9/10",

It is actually the product of two films: The first version was never released for two reasons: The studio had a backlog of war related movies to release while the war was still underway and the Big Sleep could wait; the second was the weak performance and poor costuming of Lauren Bacall. When they re-shot the film the logical, if plodding sequence early in the film was ditched in exchange for a sketchy, much faster paced beginning sequence as well as other scenes that supported the faster pace. The result was a mystery so simultaneously intriguing and confusing that neither the writers, Howard Hawks the director and nor the original book's author, Raymond Chandler, could figure out who did three of the killing. But that didn't matter, it was a riveting movie and like Casablanca a fine example of what the studio's movie factory model could produce. The DVD has an earlier version and a UCLA film school comparison of the two productions. It is well worth the time to watch it despite its being a little academic.",

            "content": "\"The Big Sleep\" is a murder mystery which grips its audience right from the start and never lets go. Its story about a private detective's investigation which initially involves a missing person and gambling debts soon mushrooms into a complicated series of developments which lead to shoot-outs, murders, blackmail and numerous subplots which involve a whole variety of very shady characters. The fast moving action is consistently intriguing but also very entertaining as it features many humorous moments and also one of the most brilliant screenplays ever written.Private detective Philip Marlowe (Humphrey Bogart) is employed by the very wealthy but ailing General Sternwood (Charles Waldron) because he's received a demand for payment of his daughter Carmen's gambling debts and his employee (Sean Regan) who'd dealt with a previous similar demand had disappeared.The demand had been made by a bookseller called Geiger (Theodore von Eltz) and when Marlowe follows him to his house, he hears gun shots and discovers Carmen (Martha Vickers) in a drugged up state and Geiger's dead body together with a list of his blackmail victims.In a conversation with Vivian (Lauren Bacall) who's Carmen's older sister, Marlowe's told that a blackmail demand has also been received relating to a compromising photograph of Carmen. In order to pay the ransom, Vivian attempts to borrow the money from Eddie Mars (John Ridgely) whose a professional gambler. Marlowe's subsequent investigations eventually unveil what had happened to Regan and he then cleverly ties up the loose ends in a manner which avoids his employer from the distress he would inevitably have suffered if he'd been made aware of the whole unsavoury truth.The screenplay by William Faulkener, Leigh Brackett and Jules Furthman is scintillating and smart throughout and contains numerous wisecracks and plenty of innuendo when Bogart and Bacall indulge in their now famous race track conversation.Humphrey Bogart is perfect as the tough and cynical Marlowe who's incapable of being shocked by anything that happens and has a witty one-liner for every occasion. He's also a \"babe magnet\" and flirts with a number of women, most notably a bookseller who gets friendly with him very quickly, takes off her glasses, unties her hair, pulls down the blind and closes the shop for the afternoon!! In another amusing encounter with a female taxi driver, she gives him her business card and says \"if you can use me again sometime call this number\" and when Marlowe asks \"day and night?\" she replies \"night's better, I work during the day\".Lauren Bacall is very cool and composed as the elegant Vivian but also proves to be Marlowe's equal when it comes to exchanges of witty repartee. Famously, it was the wish to exploit the commercial appeal of Bogart and Bacall's on screen chemistry that led to the movie being re-edited at some cost to the coherence of the end product.In this movie we see what happens when an already complicated plot is presented in a way which disrupts the narrative, omits important elements of exposition and alludes to some of the subject matter (e.g. pornography, homosexuality, nymphomania, drug use etc) in ways which are either extremely coy or elliptical. The result is an entity which is devoid of many of the reference points which audiences normally rely upon and consequently it becomes rather abstract. The fact that \"The Big Sleep\" withstands this treatment and remains a supreme example of classic film noir is testament to its intrinsic quality, its great performances and its superb screenplay.",

            "content": "Gumshoe Philip Marlowe is idolized today by many fans of \"The Big Sleep,\" but when the film first came out how did audiences regard him? And what may have been the intentions of the film's makers in creating an antihero with a personal code of ethics and honor that take him outside morality and the law to serve the interests of his jaded wealthy client? Unsavory underworld types seem to drop dead just about as quickly as they run into Marlowe. Not surprisingly, this perfectly serves his client, General Sternwood, who has told Marlowe simply to \"get rid of\" the blackmailer who threatens to expose Sternwood's daughter as a junky and a slut unless he gets paid for some bogus gambling debts. Never mind that Marlowe doesn't personally pull the trigger on Geiger, the phony rare books seller with a sideline in blackmail. In the unavoidable logic of this fatalistic movie the extortionist's fate is sealed the moment that Marlowe walks through his door.Just as much as he serves his client, Marlowe is the agent of doom, a symbol of the dark principle of poetic justice that informs so many noir movies made in Hollywood during the forties and the fifties. Yet he is not so much admirable as repugnant in the role of fickle finger of fate, like a pariah with a curse upon his head.Should we idolize him? He never does anything that doesn't perfectly serve the corrupt interests of the rich. If General Sternwood owned a factory and the workers there were on strike, you can bet that a private dick exactly like Philip Marlowe would be on the opposite side of the picket line attacking the strikers with a brickbat. Why? Because a private eye like Marlowe, who comes from the same tradition as the real life union-busting Pinkertons, would never fail to do anything in the interest of a wealthy paying client.There's nothing wrong with the movie though. In fact, it's fairly realistic and very well made. Like the works of the bourgeois French novelist Honore de Balzac, which were much admired by Karl Marx, the novels of Raymond Chandler and the movies based upon them are most interesting for the realistic portraits they present of the criminal and upper classes, which in \"The Big Sleep\" seem very much alike. But Marlowe's no hero for getting his wealthy client off cheaply, he's just another cossack serving the interests of a spoiled and decadent czar.",

This detective-film noir classic has more action than most do, and its a good thing because it needs it. This is no Double Indemnity or Out of The Past. Plot is its weakest point. The way things are filmed is its strongest. And both Bogart and Bacall are very very good here.

            "content": "I've seen this many times over the years and it's a Bogey/Bacall classic filled with sexual tension and innuendo in a complex crime drama murder mystery and filled with the stylish atmosphere of a film noir. Raymond Chandler had developed his Phillip Marlowe character for six years in pulp fiction throughout the 1930's and in 1938 he began writing The big Sleep, which in 1939 became his first novel to introduce the Marlowe character. The screenplay is adapted from his novel by William Faulkner, Leigh Brackett and Jules Furthman. Legendary director Howard Hawks who directed such classics as Scarface, Sergeant York, Air Force, To Have and Have Not, Red River and Rio Bravo began filming The Big Sleep in 1944, six months before Bogart and Bacall were married. It went through some re shot scenes and some editing and was shelved throughout 1945 until the actors were called back and some scenes were re shot and two additional scenes were included and after more editing was finally released in 1946. The end result is a complex, hard to follow dialog driven film that has many complexities to keep track of including murder, organized crime, pornography, bootlegging and missing persons. Marlowe is a hard boiled private eye who is hired by a millionaire to stem a blackmail scheme. The dysfunctional family of Marlowes employ for this assignment includes the millionaires two femme fatal daughters. This film overflows with corrupt and crooked characters. Cinematographer Sidney Hicks who had his beginnings in silent films and went on to do such movies as To Have and Have Not, Dark Passage, White Heat, All Through the Night and Possessed is Big Sleep's photographer. Eric Stacey who had been the production director on To Have and Have Not and the assistant film director of Gone With the Wind and Rebecca is the production director. Casablanca's Jules Weyl is the Art Director. Christian Nyby who went on to a successful career as a television director is the film editor. Renowned film composer Max Steiner provides the score. Besides Humphrey Bogart and Lauren Bacall, the fine cast includes Martha Vickers, Dorothy Malone, Regis Toomey, John Ridgely, Louis Jean Heydt, Charles Waldron and Peggy Knudsen.

            "content": "On one hand, this film is a simple, straight-forward, Hollywood star vehicle for Humphrey Bogart and Lauren Bacall.  On the other hand, there is actually a really strong story here, very well told, with good performances, a great script, and more than enough twists to keep even the most jaded viewer puzzled.To go along with these two levels are two versions of the film.  The theatrical version, released in 1946, was significantly re-edited to put more attention on the combination of Bogart and Bacall.  At the time, Bacall was a hot property with a shaky future.  Her career was on the edge, and she needed \"The Big Sleep\" to succeed in order to cement her standing in Hollywood.  But remember, this is the studio system.  Warner Bros. was even more concerned about her career than she was.  So, when the film was originally completed, red flags flew up all over the place, and people were scared that it would kill her career.  There needed to be more sexy dialogue between Bacall and Bogart.  The romance angle between the two of them had to be played up much more.  It's what the audience expected, and if you give them something other than that, even if it's good, the film will fail.  And for the love of God, get rid of the bloody veil.  Unfortunately, something of the story was lost.  \"The Big Sleep\" has a seriously complicated and confusing storyline.  The 1946 theatrical version adds to the problem.  That's why (call me a philistine) I prefer the 1945 pre-release version.  Yes, you heard me right.  I'd happily give up a silly, pointless conversation about horses to get that scene in the D.A.'s office.\nLook, I'm a fan of Bogart's.  I really am.  But no one is going to pretend he's the greatest actor in the world.  I happen to think he's under-rated, personally, but he's still no great shakes.  Better than Keanu Reeves, nowhere near Anthony Hopkins.  And Bacall... well, she's not nearly as good as Bogart.  The great strength of this film is the script and the story. There's lots of great dialogue.  There are loads of colorful, devious, fascinating characters.  There is a fantastic, clever, and meticulously plotted story.  Why undercut all of those things to devote more screen time to Bogart/Bacall?  Don't get me wrong, I'm not questioning the wisdom of the studio's decision. They needed a star vehicle, so they made it a star vehicle, and it worked. The judgement of history has to be with Warner Bros.  But Warner Bros. had a different set of criteria to make their decision.  They were worried about money... box-office receipts for this film, and the future marketability of Lauren Bacall.  But I don't care about that.  I'm just interested in the better film, and the pre-release version, in my opinion, is clearly the better film.  I do have one question, though... who killed Owen Taylor?  The conventional wisdom is that it was Joe Brody.  But watch the scene in Brody's apartment again.  Remember, this is a Hollywood detective movie from the mid-forties. The scene clearly plays as though Brody didn't Taylor, and it certainly appears that Marlowe believes Brody on this point.  If it really was Brody, then this scene ends up looking weak.  If Taylor killed himself (highly doubtful, considering the evidence), that's even more weak.  Oh well.  It's really a quibble.",

On first viewing though, it is difficult to follow the many characters and situations (killings, blackmail, romances) and will have you scratching your head instead of enjoying the film. The main thing to take away is that Marlowe and Vivian are falling in love slowly but gradually throughout the film.Nothing against Hawks here; there is great direction in every scene and the acting is beyond phenomenal. The screenwriters deserve appraisal as well since they have put together a very intricate story which happens to work, even if you can't decipher it on first viewing. Films that make the audience have to think and pay attention usually deserve merit; look at the television show The Wire, for instance. Every detail is there for a reason even if it is difficult to grasp on first viewing. However, with a television show it is easy to fill in gaps of what you may miss in the scenes or even the episodes to follow, but with a film that is just under two hours and as complex as The Big Sleep you NEED to rewatch it. Films with rewatchability is one thing, but films that require you to rewatch them are not necessarily fun experiences. Important maybe, but not fun.Humphrey Bogart and Lauren Bacall are very convincing in their roles. They make the film bearable to watch. There is also some excitement in the film as there are little bits of action when you hear a gunshot or see somebody gunned down. With this film being somewhat action- oriented it makes up for the fact that you cannot follow the plot the first time (but only slightly).Give this film a shot if it sounds like something you might revisit, but do not be surprised if you're scratching your head through the duration of the film.3.0/4.0",

A very legendary couple. They were married in our state the year before the 1946 release. This was a major publicity event, with massive news coverage. All the local people here knew about it. 1945 was the year that World War Two ended. People were tired of war movies. Back to gangsta films with tons of men and a few fashionable women, lol. There are no Cagney or Edward G. Robinson here. Just a lot of two-bit mentally-challenged criminals, from what I can see.So, the two lead thespians were married by the time this film debuted. Did they get married during the production? Was that why the Hays Office allowed certain sexual-innuendo dialogue such as the horse racing description? Bogey was past his prime in the age department; he was to pass away only 11 years later in real life. Bacall was a young, delicate thing of early 20s. Somehow, they still seem to match together despite a 25 year age difference. Go ahead and scratch, Mrs. Rutledge. Bogart was old enough to be Bacall's father. He gave her two children, in real life. Go figure.Bacall sang a smokey song in front of a bunch of men. Was this her own voice, or was she dubbed? I haven't figured this out, yet. She was quite the center of attention, and held all of the men in her thrall. Bogey walked in on this extravaganza, and his character must have been very envious of Bacall's electrical magnetism from the masculine audience. They were all spellbound by this sultry songstress. This is what I would call an all-men and one woman crowd scene.Carmen (Martha Vickers) was one little temptress. She was even a little prettier than Bacall, but Bacall was known for haughtiness, staring up/down from a sharply sculptured face, aloofness, wisecracks, etc. You never want to outshine the star, however. I understand that some of Vickers' scenes were cut before final production, in order to make Bacall shine even more.Both sisters were up to their ears in trouble, meeting and knowing bad guys and assorted moronic criminals. The actresses seemed to pull off their parts well. The bookstore women also did a nice job, e.g. Dorothy Malone.Elisha Cook, Jr. is always an effective character. I thought he was called Babyface in another film.The general, Charles Waldron, is effective as an elderly, ill man. The actor was to pass away not long after the 1946 release. Was he ill in real life, during production? Bacall's metallic short jacket (gold or silver lame'?) looked stunning. I wish that I could have seen this outfit in color, but then it wouldn't be film-noir-ish, right? Tons of guns and no brains. Low-pay detective. Philip Marlowe (Bogart) had some great lines. Marlowe was so smart. The five hundred dollar check was giant bucks to such a poverty-stricken PI. You're not tall, Marlowe (the censors may have inserted another sexual innuendo here, but no such luck). If I were tall, baby, ooh-la-la (no such dialogue; I made that up). Snappy lines for Bogey; almost hilarious in places.Title musings: Bogart didn't want to undergo The Big Sleep, the dirt nap, the place where all the bad guys go who don't want to go straight -- the lifers who \"expire\" behind prison walls. He was way too smart for that. He wanted to survive, to have Happy Ever After with Bacall. I even thought I saw stunt double acting during his getting beaten-up scene-chewing. The producers wouldn't want the real Bogie getting his pretty face mangled by some goofball theatrical thugs.I am a writer and historian from the university.

New scenes would crop up; scenes I was certain I had seen in the past were suddenly missing. And always, the plot made no real sense.Blame it all on Lauren Bacall. She'd been a huge hit in \"To Have and to Have Not,\" playing opposite Bogart in her screen debut. So Warners, eager to capitalize on her natural sex appeal, had rushed her into another film, \"Confidential Agent,\" where she played opposite Charles Boyer. They, it turned out, had no chemistry and the picture bombed. But by the time that had happened, Bogie and Betty had wrapped Bacall's third film, \"The Big Sleep.\" So Warners held up its release so they could shoot some new scenes that would make Bacall look good.The result was that a couple of different versions of this classic exist today and when you toss in the cutting for TV, you wind up with a mishmash of scenes that leave you guessing as to what the film is all about, who killed whom, and how could writers of the caliber of Raymond Chandler (author of the original novel) William Faulkner and Jules Furthman come up with this mess.My favorite scene takes place at the rural gambling casino operated by Eddie Mars. There, in a side room, we come upon Bacall singing an obviously heavily rehearsed song with a whole group of backup singers providing harmony. There is no prior reference to Bacall's character being a singer and no further reference to her song in the rest of the movie.But the real stunner is Eddie Mars' blond wife, played in her one and only scene toward the end of the film, by different actresses in the two main versions of the film.Never mind. This picture has lots of crackling good Howard Hawks style dialogue and a great, slick Warners film noir atmosphere. Both Bogie and Betty are at the top of their games and are surrounded by great supporting players, from Dorothy Malone to Elisha Cook Jr and B-Western star Bob Steele, who was positively scary when he played a modern day killer.Watch this one, because try as they might, nobody does this kind of work today.",

            "content": "\"The Big Sleep\" is a film of its time; in its time it was one of the very best and, for me, it remains so. For many of a younger generation it will be of no interest - it's black and white, there's no nudity, overt sex, foul language, gory violence or, of course, CGI . Neither is there the modern loud background noise, designed to create an apparent atmosphere when there isn't actually any, or to fill in the void where there's no script. Quite simply, the background noise isn't necessary because the story and script fill the available space more than adequately.Actually,\"The Big Sleep\" is a brilliant film. It has a fantastic, if convoluted story that is, admittedly, sometimes difficult to follow, and unbelievably good performances from the 2 main stars, Bogart and Bacall. The electricity between these 2 is tangible and their scenes together are magical.Younger audiences will simply not even switch on, or will switch off within 20 minutes. Older and wiser audiences will watch and, where necessary, watch again in order to ensure that they follow the story. Yes, it might take a bit of perseverance but, My God, is it worth it. The rapid fire exchanges and overall characterisations can't be beaten. Bogart and Bacall, at her sultry best, were never better and Bogart was the perfect personification of Chandler's Philip Marlowe.I've watched this wonderful film many times over the last 50 years and never tire of it; in fact, I usually notice something new each time. There's drama, mystery, romance and even a bit of comedy. Lauren Bacall even does a bit of jazzy singing, similar to her role in\"To Have and Have Not\" and which is equally good.It's brilliant and addictive film; it demands being watched more than once, twice, even three times and more. Anyone who enjoys real films with real acting, real scripts and real scenery will love it. I mark it as a film of its time and it's a 10 all day and year long.",

The Killer in the Rain, The Curtain, and Fingerman. Howard Hawks saw the chemistry between Bogart and Bacall after the success of \"To have and have not\". So he teamed them up again quickly. The Big Sleep was actually started towards the end of 1944. It was finished in early 45. And it contained 20 minutes of film never seen by the public.  He saw it was a good movie but something was missing. It didn't quite have the chemistry the earlier film had had. So it was  shelved for just over a year. In the meantime Bogart and Bacall had become married. Lauren Bacall also had another movie that was released. It was a flop and Hawks was worried. He decided to go back and reshoot a few scenes. He was very happy with the result. And it became the classic we all love today. The original 1945 Directors Cut of The Big Sleep is out on video now. I saw it a year ago and I understand why it was never released. The new scenes showed how Bogart and Bacall had really fallen in love and really spiced up the movie. It really is a classic and a film never to be missed. I give it  4.5 out of 5 stars.",

Clever writing at the beginning distinguishes the \"movie\" Marlowe (not very tall, are you) from Chandler's Marlowe (tall, aren't you) without distracting from the story. I prefer the original film with Pat Clark as Eddie's wife - she is a BABE-ORAMA as Chandler created her. As others have pointed out, the film is full of beauties. And because there was such a shortage of males at home during WW2 (either too young or too old according to a pop tune) even a guy like Bogart had to fight'em off (or not). The book also makes it clear that Carol and Geiger, in addition to blackmail, dealing in drugs,dirty books and pictures, are homosexual lovers (subtly hinted at in the movie description of Geiger) - hence Carol's murderous rage when Geiger is killed. Eddie's demise at the end of the film departs from Chandler but is probably a better movie finish. One of Howard Hawks' best.",

Warner Brothers, it is alleged, didn't like spending too much on sets and directors frightened of being too obvious used low lighting and smoke to try and blur the edges. This creates a look that many with bigger budgets have seeked to emulate. Here we are almost in a dream world - or maybe more accurately, a nightmare world.Death is never far away and anyone not needed for plot purposes is soon found with a bullet in them. There is one scene where no one actually knows how somebody ended up dead - but this is mere window dressing in this dark and dangerous world.Bogart is without doubt the best thriller actor of all time. Not conventionally handsome or even vocally versatile his acting remains strangely modern and natural. Ambiguous about all matters from sudden death to good manners - he is, strangely, neither hero nor anti-hero. However we believe he will do the right thing as events unfold.His reaction to danger is strange and almost manic: Point a gun at him and he wll smile, tell him a joke and he won't. Not that he is without dry humour or a sharp one liner. Here - like many of his films - he is a veneer stripper, tearing down the outer to get to the reality underneath.In today's film world sex, violence and greed can be tackled head-on and shown in as much detail as the director cares. In the 1940's things had to be eluded to, hinted at and even talked about in code. Sex and sexual desire seems emotions to be repressed rather than indulged in. As dangerous as Russian roulette and often having the same outcome. You are going to get lost watching this film. You can't do anything else. Given the fact that many of the points that are small and could have been cleared up with a line or a small scene it makes you wonder why.Maybe it is an attempt to confuse the censor or just trying to be true to the original material. Who knows? Those that want to own this film will get more out of it than most as they gain extra clues by multiple viewings - although this won't put you right on all matters.",

It's style is similar to the Maltese falcon, however I think each are as good as the other. In the Maltese falcon Boggart seems to play the same character as the one in the big sleep, just with a different name. So similar are the characters that they even have the same punch. I'm surprised they don't have the same name. If anything I recommend watching the film just for the dialogue. From a writers point of view, it would be a dream to have skill such a that.

Everything from wanting to cash in on the Bogart/Bacall craze (wrote new scenes so they were together more), to Raymond Chandler thinking Bacall's acting wasn't as good as Martha Vickers (so they edited Vickers down), to changing the story from the book to appease the Hayes commission (so you have to guess Carmen was photographed nude, you can only wonder about the relationship between two men, etc.), to editing out a scene where Bogart explains what's going on (why, why?!). All of this and more means the film was written, rewritten, edited and re-edited to appease everything but the story.But the film looks great. It has that wonderful film noir feel, with rainy wet streets, most of the action at night, great outfits, LA bungalows, night clubs. All of it captures a detective story in rainy 1940s LA. A great black and white atmosphere, so great you almost don't worry about the story, but it nags at you and you find yourself saying, 'wait, who is that?' 'what's going on?'. So it could have been terrific, but it is just good.I'm not sure about the rave reviews or why it is installed in the AFI top 100. Doesn't a film have to have a coherent plot to even be considered?Regardless, it is worth watching and fun to read about later, but there are much better movies you can actually understand. Casablanca, The Third Man, etc. Are great film noirs that have stories you can actually follow.",

            "content": "The Big Sleep(1946) was to originally to be released in 1944 and was previewed to a small audience in a 116 minute cut.  Due to the filmmakers dissatifaction of the cut the film was shelved for two years and rereleased two years later with more emphasis on Bogart and Bacall instead of plot elements.  The 1944 version claifies who murdered who and the motive for the murders.  Also, Eddie Mar's wife is played by a different actress in the 1944 version than the 1946 version.  This edition is interesting to watch as comparison to the 1946 version.\nAfter changes were made and a new focus was created, The Big Sleep became more a film of the foreplay of Bogart and Bacall with the plot as secondary. The 1946 Edition of The Big Sleep became one of the greatest film Noirs in movie history.  In this cut the chain of murders are more complex and the plot is a string of labyrinth doors.  A couple of scenes were dropped and replaced with new scenes to the filmmakers likings.  The talk between Phillip Marlowe and Bernie Ohis is longer is this version.\nThe constant foreplay throughout the film between Phillip Marlowe and Vivian Sternwood Rutledge is the main memorable aspect of The Big Sleep(1946). Most of it was real due to the fact that the actors playing the parts married each other during filming.  The relationship is full of the usual trademarks from the director concerning a man and a woman.  Exceeds the level of foreplay shown in the couple's previous pairing in To Have and Have Not(1944).  I enjoyed this part of the film and thought the filmmakers were right in making the changes they made.\nOne of the ten confusing masterpieces of all time.  Confusing in the sense of the murderer or motive of a chain reaction of violence.  Some of the plot elements of The Big Sleep were so confusing that even the writer of the Original novel had trouble knowing who did what.  Probably has to be watched more than three times to try to get a clear understanding of what's going on.  The plot confusion of this pic has become part of Hollywood legend.\nLike many great Noir pictures the plot of this one is surrounded by a labyrinth of tangling proportions.  Need a machete to cut through the thick plot lines to know what's going on.  A great labyrinth mystery is not the answer but finding the way to the solution.  Bad labyrinth mysteries lead to nowhere but endless questions and little interest in the process of going through the mystery.  The complexities of the story is what makes The Big Sleep(1946) intriguing.\nThe sexually charged horse race talk between Bogart and Bacall is a classic scene of film history.  Use of subtle references make the scene more juicy and less obvious.  The erotic nature of dialogue between the two actors is well disguised.  Examplifies the on screen persona of the Bogie-Bacall relationship.  A highlight of dialogue in film that is hard to top.\nCanino is a Howard Hawks villain that's is a unforgettable character.  In the few scenes he appears in he fills the screen with a sadistic presence. None more memorable than with the count to three like the movie speech he makes to Harry Jones.  Bob Steele plays Canino with a breeze of coolness and gusto.  Canino enters and exists the screen in memorable fashion.\nThe Big Sleep(1946) is one of three masterpieces by Howard Hawks made back to back to back.  The first meeting between Phillip Marlowe and Mrs. Rutledge is one of my favorite scenes.  Dario Argento would play homage to his moment even paraphasing some of the dialogue in Cat O'Nine Tails(1970). The writers involved in the picture were some of the best in film and literature.  Humphrey Bogart perfects even further the persona of the romantic rough guy in trench coat.\nGets a fine film score from the always reliable Max Steiner.  Dorothy Malone is fine in the one scene she has in The Big Sleep(1946).  Philip Marlowe unlike Sam Spade has a more friendly relationship with the District Attorney and Assistent District Attorney.  Lauren Bacall brings with her the charisma and coolness that made her a star in To Have & Have Not(1944).  John Ridgely is calm but tough as the main heavy Eddie Mars.\nOne memorable is the opening introduction between Private Detective Philip Marlowe and Carmen Sternwood.  Another memorable moment is the negotiation tactics between Marlowe and a blackmailer in a hotel room.  The beginning of this scene is a replay of the climatic moment in the hotel of To Have and Have Not(1944).  A third memorable moment takes place after a part of the plot has been cleared up.  A final memorable moment is the telephone game played by Marlowe and Mrs. Rutledge on the Police.",

It would make me feel so much better to know that Howard Hawks 1946 feature starring screen royalty Humphrey Bogart and Lauren Bacall would survive into eternity. I've been open with the fact that I love Humphrey Bogart. I believe Bogart to be the greatest actor to ever live. One might think I would have a definite pick, being a huge fan of Bogart, of which of his roles is my favorite. I don't have a favorite; what I actually have is a rotating list of what I call my favorite Bogart role. The Big Sleep, In A Lonely Place and The Maltese Falcon, are always in contention, as are Key Largo, To Have And Have Not, and, of course, Casablanca. The point is, The Big Sleep makes the long list of my favorite Bogart film. The Big Sleep finds Humphrey playing detective Philip Marlowe hired by a wealthy family to protect the patriarch's youngest daughter from being blackmailed. Of course, the detective is Humphrey Bogart so the case is far from simple, in fact, Marlowe must face murder, blackmail, and of course, love.General Sternwood (Charles Waldron) hires Detective Philip Marlowe (Humphrey Bogart) to stop a blackmailing attempt of his youngest daughter Carmen (Martha Vickers). While tailing the blackmailer, Marlowe hears a gunshot and witnesses men rushing out to their car. Upon entering the home, Marlowe discovered Carmen drugged in a chair with the blackmailer dead at her feet. An empty camera left behind proved a photo to be taken probably with an attempt at further blackmail. Marlowe follows the trail of clues, in an attempt to regain the photo, leading him to a series of people involved in gambling. While investigating the case, Marlowe also meets General Sternwood's oldest daughter, Vivian Rutledge (Lauren Bacall) a divorc\u00e9e who catches the eye of Detective Marlowe. Vivian takes to assisting Marlowe with the case, which is beneficial for the both of them as chemistry grows between them. Working together yet independently, the two spin a web which leaves the blackmailers no choice but to get caught in it.I can't write about The Big Sleep without highlighting the dialogue. The pace of the witty dialogue was aided by Humphrey Bogart's incredible delivery. There's no one else in the history of cinema that I enjoy watching speak more than Humphrey Bogart. Bogart is the absolute king of line delivery. A point I probably don't need to make is how incredible the chemistry was between Bogart and Bacall. The pair was already married, after having met while co-starring in the film To Have and Have Not three years prior. Their relationship hadn't lost a step, and their love resonated beyond the screen making them enjoyable to watch on-screen together. One of my favorite scenes is tucked within The Big Sleep. Humphrey Bogart waiting out the rain in a quaint bookshop while tailing the blackmailer is pure art. That scene had everything, quick-witted Humphrey Bogart line delivery, his on- screen persona as a hard-nosed yet romantic lead, and the gorgeous black and white shadows of film noir. There is just no purer image in the world than a trenchcoat and fedora wearing rain-soaked Humphrey Bogart, I'm convinced. The Big Sleep is a film I can watch anytime, I don't need to be \"in the mood\" for it because it's as comfortable as a warm blanket. The black and white photography, the dialogue, a favorite on-screen duo, my favorite actor, and of course, the trench coats make The Big Sleep a joy to watch no matter how many times I've seen it.",

If you miss even a minute of this film, you are lost.A question that is asked several times in the comments is \"Who Killed Sean Regan\".If you don't know, it is because you were not listening.At the end of the film we are told that Eddie Mars killed Sean Regan and blamed it on Carmen so that he could blackmail Vivian into helping with the cover-up, thus keeping her father from investigating.General Sternwood hired Marlowe to stop the blackmail by Geiger, not to find Sean Regan.",

I didn't quite realize this until the scene where Bogart is skulking behind some parked cars and shoots his gun so that it is heard by one of the heavies employed by Mr Mars. This hardened tough-guy thug-type gangster then takes off like a startled bunny-rabbit, or electrified hare, hurdles hedgerows like an Olympic athlete, and disappears into the distance, never to be seen again. The effect is undeniably comic. I then understood most of the rest was deadpan funny as well.One reviewer thinks that the script is American. Although admittedly influenced by Hammett, it's more like a cross between P.G.Wodehouse and early Evelyn Waugh, and therefore thoroughly British, particularly since Chandler grew up in Britain.The girls, except for Lauren Bacall, are great. I wouldn't miss Bacall, and her romance with Bogart didn't convince, either on or off-screen. But that's just my personal opinion.One of the script-writers, Jules Furthman, also had a hand in another very funny film, called \"The Outlaw\". Both these films are classics, widely recognized as such but both are seriously misunderstood. Towards the end Bogart actually says: \"I didn't know they made 'em like this any more.\" I think he's talking about Bacall.",

The same devices are used as in The Maltese Falcon - Bogart is in every scene and the story is revealed only by him. There are no flashbacks. Every phone conversation only shows him. Unfortunately there is no Sydney Greenstreet or Peter Lorre in this one, just a myriad of characters. So it's difficult to get a hold on what's happening, especially when important characters are named but never seen. And crimes keep happening, but the major one is obscured! Anyhow, the film is famous for not revealing itself easily so I just enjoyed it as a puzzle and knew I was watching one of the classics of Old Hollywood!",

After this his initial meeting with Bacall is an anticlimax. Later some real heat develops between them but only in one memorable scene. He has a great scene with Dorothy Malone and some sparkling dialogue, more really good scenes with Martha Vicker, but unfortunately there is too much talk (and plot) in the movie and the other actors, though good (Elisha Cook Jnr. aside who is better) are not great enough for it. So well worth a watch but not for the story but for scenes, dialogue and about 5 performances. Set decoration is also very good and the recurrent use of various guns hidden in prepared holders in Marlowe/Bogart's glove compartment is amusing. I will watch it again though.",

And i don't think that it was a good thing, quite the opposite: it was literally a film guided by dialogs, and not the cleverest ones.I meant, it's very hard to follow what's happening after a while. Even if you pay a lot of attention to the dialog, it will still confusing you. There are things that are never explained in the film, and the amount of characters that are presented and abruptly exits the story may as well confuse the viewer.Also, as a film itself, it don't has that much to offers beside the plot. The acting is very average, and so is the music, which perhaps is as well very cheesy. The cinematography was good sometimes, but left a lot to be wished.And what bothered me in the technical aspects was the lazy edition. Come on. The transition of the scenes sometimes were just plain bad, and sometimes there was even two cuts in different angles from the same scene, without any continuity, to worse the things.But fine. It had a good interesting theme despite being way too confusing. It's about a complex scenario of a death and it's consequences that all the characters suffered. There is a lot of changes from the novel it was adapted,mostly due to the censorship that wouldn't allow a few things to go too far. The romantic trace in the relationship between Marlowe and Vivian would be impossible to transfer integrally from the book to the big screen, because Vivian was a married character in the book and there was a law in USA at the time which wouldn't allow the depiction of marital infidelity in the film.Anyways...it's a very watchable film, despite all his complexities and also despite not explaining too much for the viewer. 7.4/10",

And that is Howard Hawks' The-Big-Sleep (2.5/4), the same director who gave us Bogart-&-Bacall's fabulous first team together in film of Hemingway's Martinique war drama, To-Have-And-Have-Not (44).Howard had an eye for talent (Red-River) and 40s favorite Bogart performs his part with typical finesse as private eye Marlowe. The same cannot be said for wife Bacall whose cold Vivian is clearly no kin to sultry Slim in The-Haves, sleepwalking through this 2-hour snoozer. Sweets (coquettes) are a poor swap for a tasty entr\u00e9e (story) and, excepting one great scene in Geiger's (Acme's afternoon fling is forced), the rest of this tiresome tale is merely a cheesecake display where every dame on the court, even the hack, drives hard to the hoop hoping to score points with PM. Howard surely had a sugar tooth for his film has more treats than a grabby Halloween ghoul, fleeting film femme Sonia \"Do So!\" Darrin, aka the \"grapefruit\" gal, its sweetest, coming unwrapped in Bogie's cutest scene as the Bookworm (\"No, no no no no\").And though Philip Marlowe preceded the Age of Gadgetry, one can see Hawks' All-Hero was template for Ian Fleming's super spy, James Bond. Not until 007 do we see a chick-magnet the likes of Humphrey Bogart in The-Big-Sleep. And the sirens (Lauren Dot Martha Sonia Joy), they make the Bond Girls look 2nd-string.",

            "content": "Only a tick after the Warner Brothers logo and theme song fill the room do the silhouettes of Humphrey Bogart and Lauren Bacall appear, trading cigarettes, exuding the allure only found behind the angular sunglasses of a dragon lady or a glamorized goon. Their names then appear with the rush of a bold statement; in 1946, they were the titles of stars, of top- drawer actors. In 2015, they're godly, legendary, untouchable. As the shadowed bodies, the gigantic names, and the dangling cigarettes of the leads appear before the title of the movie itself, a tone is already established. The Big Sleep will be a film in which Bogie and Bacall prefer slippery chats over liquor and smoke to breathy romance; it will be a film in which style, wit, and danger come first and intelligibility follows second.The Big Sleep is perhaps the film noir, the quintessential Bogart and Bacall pairing, the movie that sidestepped the sunniness of all those Technicolor, 1940s morale boosters in trade of something almost unhinged in its cool. It was the film that initially showed me just how beguiling actors could be, how captivating pure cinema could be, how bewitching dialogue could be. I've seen The Big Sleep twenty times or so (who's counting?), but each viewing brings some new discovery unnoticed by the previous undertaking. My last was an attempt to introduce my sister to its enticing world. This time around, some months later, I find myself re-enchanted by the chemistry between Bogart and Bacall, more appreciative of the silky screenplay. Each viewing changes \u2014 some are out of a nostalgic need, some are out of a desire to consume flawless filmmaking \u2014 but one thing always remains the same: no film has ever matched The Big Sleep's unflagging ability to excite.This is an amazing accomplishment for a film that doesn't make any sense \u2014 famously, the author of the novel, the incomparable Raymond Chandler, had a hard time deciding if a major character had been killed or had committed suicide \u2014 but one doesn't worry about plot twists or big payoffs here. We become so wrapped up in the stunning rapport between the leads (to be married after completion) and the quick (but razor sharp) dialogue that it's easy to forget that films normally, you know, make sense. It's not a case of style over substance but rather style with substance that gives us many memorable moments that just so happen to lead to nowhere. But those moments.It's the story of a private detective, Phillip Marlowe (Bogart), and a case given to him by the poisonously wealthy General Sternwood (Charles Waldron). It seems that one of Sternwood's wild daughters, Carmen (Martha Vickers), has put herself in the middle of a blackmailing scheme, and the girl, thumb-sucking and Lolita-esque, is too na\u00efve to get herself out of the racket. Marlowe, sardonic and clever, is the perfect man for the job \u2014 but the case, as it turns out, is much more complicated than it appears to be. It also, unfortunately, involves a murdered pornographer (Theodore von Eltz), a secretive gambling-house proprietor (John Ridgely), Sternwood's other daughter, Vivian (Bacall), who Marlowe is attracted to, and more shady figures.As Marlowe wanders around in this muddled labyrinth of captivation, it's difficult to keep up with his thoughtful antics; but it isn't hard to find ourselves smitten with the hard-boiled world Howard Hawks and his congregation of screenwriters (including William Faulkner, Leigh Brackett, and Jules Furthman) concoct for us. Enhanced by Max Steiner's fierce score, interludes don't slow things down but rather keep the swiftness of everything intact; scenes, in the meantime, are brimming with such fantastic exchanges that it's difficult not to laugh along with the virtuosic lines the actors challenge each other with.And if the actors aren't part of the atmosphere, then they're sticking out of it, making it. Whereas Bacall stole scenes from Bogart in 1944's To Have and Have Not, her career defining debut, in The Big Sleep they are equal, equally sensational. Bogart played several interesting men in his long career, but Phillip Marlowe is one of his most intriguing parts, surely among his finest performances. He can spit out lines at a machine gun pace, all the while cherishing Marlowe's dexterity, having fun with it. And though only Bacall's second movie (filmed before 1945's Confidential Agent, which nearly destroyed her blossoming career), she is a presence in the same way Dietrich or Garbo were in their early days: positively magnetic and unlike anything else found on theater screens of the time. Together, Bogart and Bacall almost set the camera on fire, and not just during love scenes; their real-life romance makes every scene throb with intrigue, and it still shows today. Supporting performances, particularly from the underrated Martha Vickers and Sonia Darrin, make huge statements, no matter how small the part.Almost 70 years later, The Big Sleep remains vital. It's a landmark in the personal lives of its stars, a landmark in cinema, and a landmark work for a director so versatile that Gentlemen Prefer Blondes and Red River are completely separate yet somehow fronted by the same man. I'll probably watch it twenty more times, but until then, The Big Sleep is one of the best films ever made.Read more reviews at petersonreviews.com",

Mystery and the art of making movies so complex and confusing that you must wait on the edge of your seat the whole movie just to understand. Some of the greatest things about this movie is how it went about using Innuendo and avoiding showing scenes in which Bogart may have slept with the woman he was speaking with. A perfect example of this would be when Bogart who plays Private detective phillip marlowe visits a book shop to find out some more about a man named Geiger. He does this by asking about a special edition Ben Hur that doesn't exist, but instead decides to flirt with the clerk. This turns into an innuendo filled dialogue that howard hawks was known for. The scene ends with the clerk grabbing two glasses for some whiskey and shutting the blinds and locking the door. Therefore showing that they may have had some afternoon delight in between the fadeout and when the scene begins again.

            "content": "Whether you're watching this as a lazy rainy day movie or a Raymond Chandler aficionado hoping to see a very decent adaptation of one of his best (most likely, the best) novels, you will not be disappointed!Humphrey Bogart seemed born to play the role of Chandler's hard-boiled detective, Philip Marlowe in a performance that still holds weight with fans of Chandler's classic and enthralling private eye novelettes. In fact, I think that only the great Robert Mitchum seemed better cast as Marlowe, but Bogie surely gets away with doing what he does best: playing a wise-talking detective in a similar vein to his Sam Spade of 'The Maltese Falcon'(1941).Within minutes, you can tell that this is a Warner Brothers film. The minute Marlowe walks into the Acme Book Shop! But it's all okay. It certainly adds to the charm to see Bogie sharing a drink with a knowledgeable young book seller who, when she removes her spectacles, becomes a seductive potential conquest.Undoubtedly, this is also one of those films that served as a vehicle for both Bogart and Lauren Bacall, as they remain the most memorable characters, getting into several scrapes and several scenes that hold a lot of comic lure without sliding into slapstick.Amongst the supporting cast, Sonia Darrin as Agnes Lowzier, Louis Jean Heydt as Joe Brody and Martha Vickers as Carmen Sternwood really stand out. Even Elisha Cook Jr. returns from the 'The Maltese Falcon', albeit in a slightly different role. Vickers in particular, in the few small scenes that she has, really could have excelled as the literally Looney Tunes Carmen, but the role was scaled back in order to satisfy the Hayes production code of the time (and, according to Chandler himself, to prevent her from upstaging Bacall). Other areas of the plot are also scaled back for similar reasons (especially the Geiger pornography/blackmail plot)and, although Chandler purists may baulk at them, this is, after all, an adaptation and is, thus, open to interpretation.On that note, John Ridgely is, sadly, underwhelming in the pivotal role of Eddie Mars and Charles Waldron is simply an old man sat in a wheelchair when compared with the dying and crippled General Guy Sternwood of the novel. However, Charles D. Brown is quite entertaining at times as the Sternwood butler, Norris, even if he is a bit wooden.But the charm of the Bogie 'Big Sleep' is in its atmosphere. From the rain-soaked residential streets and high-rises of 1946 Los Angeles to Mars' jolly countryside gambling club and the honky-tonk bistro where Bogie's Marlowe meets Bacall's Vivian Rutledge, this really is a gem, despite Raymond Chandler's absence from script duties ((he was busy writing the screenplay to 'The Blue Dahlia (1946)).In fact, it appeared that it was Bogie and Bacall that the audience paid to see, and the on-screen chemistry between the two is obvious, from their jokey arguments to the characters' whirlwind romance. So obvious, in fact, that several exposition scenes of dialogue explaining the plot of the film were deleted and scenes re-shot so as to focus on the future Mr. and Mrs Bogart!!An awesome adaptation of an awesome and engaging novel, 'The Big Sleep', though focusing on Bogart and Bacall, and lacking a truly inspired supporting cast, has the distinction of being an adaptation set in Chandler's Los Angeles.The 8/10 was awarded because, despite its flaws and the focus on the personal love affair of its stars, this really is an entertaining Chandler adaptation that is well worth a watch, both for crime buffs and Chandler die-hards alike!",

The story follows private detective Philip Marlowe (Humphrey Bogart), who is hired by a rich general to investigate the blackmailing that is happening to his daughter Carmen (Martha Vickers).  Also entangled in the story is her sister, Vivian Rutledge (Lauren Bacall).  The story gets so complicated that it would take far more than one short review to explain the basics of it.Despite the confusing plot, \"The Big Sleep\" is frequently hailed as being great simply because of its direction and atmosphere.  Quintessential film-noir, it has the dialogue, the characters, and the lighting that embody every great film-noir.  With the exception of \"The Maltese Falcon\", perhaps no other film-noir has captured all of these elements so perfectly.The plot keeps a hold on the viewer throughout the film.  While it's only natural to try and figure it out as it goes along, it's not really necessary to try to hard because it all resolves itself in the end.

Although entire passages of dialogue are lifted from the novel, the writers of the script, which included William Faulkner, still fail to capture the essence of Chandler's classic novel.While the bookshop scene is in the novel it consists of merely a paragraph, but in the film it is a major scene. The romance between Philip Marlowe and Vivian Sternwood is built up in the film to enhance the career of Lauren Bacall and the relationship between Bogart and her for publicity purposes. In the novel, they part ways at the end. A quote from the novel's closing pages may clear up any confusion about the title's meaning: \"What did it matter where you lay once you were dead? . . . You just slept the big sleep, not caring about the nastiness of how you died or where you fell.\"One reviewer believes that Robert Montgomery's version of Chandler's \"The Lady In The Lake\" is just as good as this film. Believing it was so poorly made, this reviewer sold it online several years ago. Another reviewer writes \"This film noir faded to black all right!

The shadows that fall over the faces and scenery are breath-taking.Bogart is Philip Marlowe a private investigator who works for the unbelievably sum of $25 per day, plus expenses. He more or less is playing his Sam Spade character from \"The Maltese Falcon\" with a little Harry Morgan from Hawks' \"To Have and Have Not\" thrown in for good measure. But this is the type of movie and role that no one does better than Bogart.Bacall is as smoking hot in this film as she was in \"To Have and Have Not\". She radiates sensuality, and knows it. But really, she should not be singing.One of my favorite bits in this movie is the fact that every woman who comes in contact with Bogart is beautiful and acts kittenish towards him. Whether it's a cab driver, book seller or cigarette girl, they all want him.The screenplay by William Faulkner is involved and often times confusing. There is a lot of dialogue to listen to, and yet it still feels as though some part of the story or exposition is being left out. Perhaps this is explained in the deleted scenes. A lot of characters that are interrelated, and many sets that look similar also add to the confusion.But the performances and brilliant direction more than make up for any shortfalls in the script.

The film stars the very highly acclaimed actor, Humphrey Bogart, who does an absolutely magnificent job in capturing the very core of his character. His portrayal of his character is classic, it is so intriguing to watch. He is so very cool, and is so effortlessly. The way he dangles his cigarette loosely on his lips, and his calm, almost cold demeanor is very rich for supporting the character he was portraying. This movie sheds new light on the glorious P.I. movies, which have not lost their popular touch even in todays cinematic area. I think this movie sets off a new craze on the whole idea of being a P.I. and all the darkness that surrounds it. The shots are done in a way that gives you a feel of doom and gloom. The darkness gives you a good feel of the mood and setting of the story being portrayed. A lot of the scenes are dark, cold, and wet, which do well in complimenting Bogart's dark, sleek, powerful character. The film is the first of its kind and is certainly a Bogart Classic.",

            "content": "\"The Big Sleep\" is one of those movies where it helps if you're in the right mood and frame of mind to watch it. This complex screenplay is based on the novel from the very gifted Raymond Chandler. None other than Humphrey Bogart would be right for the part of Philip Marlow, PI. Throw in Lauren Bacall, who was explosively successful with Bogart in 'To Have and Have Not' and you've got the potential for a great motion picture.By the end of this whirlwind, the whodunits don't seem to matter much, since we've had such a good time getting there - besides the movie is not about solving a mystery, and while gripping, is never particularly suspenseful. The film is about Marlowe, taking us through a maze of criminal networks where the dialogue sparkles as Chandler delivers completely. The script is pure magic and simply the best of the 1940's detective genre films. The only lasting criticism of the movie was it's complex and confusing plot. However, as the years go by, strangely this turns out to be a positive as well.While the novel written by Chandler is pretty straight forward, there is no central crime or criminal element that binds the story together. The story is told completely from the perspective of Marlow as he takes us through a labyrinth of crime. Racketeering on several different levels, murder, blackmail and gambling are all discussed in the novel. Pornography and homosexuality were also mentioned but could only be alluded to in the film. This 'hardboiled' style of detective writing Chandler employed was softened up a bit in the film. Comments on the decaying social and moral order, and references to crooked cops were left out of the script. Originally, the Phillip Marlow Chandler created was too professional to fall in love with his clients. Hollywood however, needed a love story, so screenwriters Faulkner, Furthman and Brackett took liberties with the novel to create a love interest between Marlow and Vivian. Because of this change, a chain reaction of other confusing changes were needed to balance out the story - the last name of Vivian - who she was married to - and how many times she had been married, all needed changing as well. I believe these modifications to the storyline impacted the performance of Bacall in the introductory scene. She came across as a shallow over protective daughter and busy-body sister. The same scene in the novel has fabric and functionality - the scene in the movie is worth little more than an introduction. Martha Vickers introductory scene is well, unforgettable.After preliminary viewings were made, Lauren Bacall's agent was concerned with her position in the film. He convinced Jack Warner to re-shoot several scenes and ramp up the dialogue in several others. The movie was originally finished in 1945 and viewed by servicemen overseas while shelved in the U.S. The 'improvements' were completed and the film finally released in 1946. The '1946' version enhanced the position of Lauren Bacall and more or less achieved what the studio wanted. The cost for this enhancement was a lack of clarity, since a key scene where Marlowe and Ohlms are talking the case over with the DA, is scrapped to make room for an amped up longer scene where Bogart and Bacall compare each other to horse racing with an obvious sexual double entendre. Sadly it was also rumored that some of Martha Vickers scenes ended up on the cutting room floor to insure Bacall was more of the standout in this picture.The code and censorship standards of the day made several scenes in the picture confusing and tricky to film. What type of books were being sold in the back of Geiger's store? What was going on with Carmen's photo shoot? When Marlowe breaks in she is fully clothed in a Chinese dress. The young bookstore clerk closes her store and lets down her hair to have drinks with Marlow on a rainy afternoon, yet we're left with the impression nothing went on? Filmmakers of the 40's had a way of taking you the precipice of something dark and dirty but never really letting you know for sure. You have to wonder what an audience in 1946 thought of all this? Maybe they read the book. All these things must be more than a little vague to a modern audience, who seldom is required to use this much imagination. Although Bogart's lines were not accelerated dialogue, the actor could deliver his lines PDQ. As with most detective films of the 40's you would think there was a shortage of celluloid, by the rapid fire bantering exchanges. In the novel Marlowe seems to prefer drinking to women, but Howard Hawks has Bogart bowling over the women in a way we wouldn't see again till 20 years later in the character of James Bond.If you're having trouble getting into the movie, there's a scene early on where Bogart is watching the house rented by Geiger. It's raining and Marlowe is hunched down in the seat of the Plymouth Coupe and fat lipping a cigarette when Carmen Stearnwood drives up. It's expertly written and beautifully filmed. At this time an invisible hand reaches out of the screen and yanks you out of your easy chair and into the story.",

Having to watch it multiple times and pay very close attention to every minor detail makes it so much more enjoyable. That's just because you actually understand what's going on this way.The classic example of the complexity is the fact that one of the many deaths in the film is never actually solved (not even by Raymond Chandler himself), and so in many ways the audience is left in the dark with regards to a number of the plot elements. Just so I could wrap my head round the plot, I was required to draw up a chart of all of the murders that take place, who is murdered, who is the murderer, and what was the motive. It took a fair while.That doesn't detract from the film though, and it is the sort of film that is just as great to watch on subsequent viewings. Humphrey Bogart is found at the top of his form as Private Investigator Philip Marlowe who doesn't know the meaning of the word quit. Lauren Bacall is also flawless as the femme fatale of the film, while Martha Vickers makes a strong contribution as Bacall's young, petulant sister. Howard Hawks' direction is snappy and the plot moves with great pace. Like I've said, there are many twists and turns in the plot, and a lot of questions are left after the first viewing. I think the great thing about the way in which it is handled, is that it doesn't try to answer every question and in that way treats its audience with respect.It also gives the audience a lot more, with great suspense, excellent chemistry (for obvious reasons) between Bogart and Bacall and a bunch of witty exchanges between Marlowe and various villainous characters: We really enjoy the detective's character and we know that he is set for a big finish. He doesn't disappoint.In retrospect, I can only say that it's an awesome film that presents one of the most complex stories of all time with style and vigour. It's a very entertaining and well-crafted work and truly deserving of the label 'classic'. For a piece of cinema that stands the test of time, it must be given a perfect rating on this occasion, despite its over-complicated nature. ***** / *****",

It wasn't the first time I watched the movie but this time I was focused on the plot writing rather than Howard Hawks' directing, Bogie and Bacall's on-screen heat, or Max Steiner's haunting musical score.Raymond Chandler is one of the best novelists in the English language but when Baldwin and Letterman claim this plot is opaque and quote Chandler as saying he couldn't follow the plot of the movie adapted from his novel it's either Chandler being jealous of his competitor, novelist William Faulkner, one of the four screenwriters, or maybe Chandler was just in a bad mood when he was asked. This movie -- with not only Faulkner but also Leigh Brackett (Star Wars: The Empire Strikes Back) as screenwriters -- has not only amazing dialogue but a detective/police procedural plot that is both intricate and mesmerizing. Anyone who can't follow this plot including Baldwin and Letterman should stick to analyzing Bugs Bunny.As much as the smoking hot acting by the entire cast, and the moody cinematography, the writing makes this movie the classic it is.",

I understand that this version is slightly different from that one which was first release. Lauren Bacall looks good in all her sconce, as do the full supporting cast of American lovelies. However the story itself is not its strong point. The film is very much studio based, and sometimes it shows. However the atmosphere of another time and place, the comedy, the good script all go a long way to make this an enjoyable film. Humphrey Bogart and Lauren Bacall look good together. I enjoyed it very much looking at the DVD giving a very intimate feeling to the film which one does not get in the cinema.",

This is mainly due to the Code that forbade every mentioning of what the blackmail was all about viz. dirty pictures. This made the story quite unintelligible to me, as I could not figure out exactly why somebody was blackmailed by a guy who runs a bookstore that apparently is a cover for something else. My first notion was not pornography, but rather drugs, espionage, or just any sort of mob business, especially as it turns out that one of the murderers' name is Canino - Italian and mafioso-like.Once I read about the story, and got the explanation, I was overwhelmed by the feeling of tardiness: Of course, I should have figured this out! Then there's the latter half of the plot that moves around Bacall's dead husband. However, by the time Canino is shot, I usually start dozing, so I've never really watched it to the end without a blackout.Chandler merged two short stories into one novel because of the similar settings. Well, having seen the movie, this wasn't very surprising to learn. Strange method this recycling: the meaningfulness of reworking unpublished works is obvious enough, but in this instance both short stories were already published before The Big Sleep.Still, Chandler is Chandler, Bacall is Bacall, and Bogart certainly is Bogart.That's the reason why I probably will be watching this picture over and over again despite disliking the story, and the dozing...",

Based on the book by the same name, this movie is truly a one of a kind in the period of the Hays Code in Hollywood. The story without spoiling anything is about a Detective named Phillip Marlowe helping and old man clear his daughter out of gambling debts. It turns into a murder mystery involving a group who creates adult films/pictures. The acting is brilliant throughout and the cinematography is solid but their is one thing keeping me from giving it a 10. Of course being 1946, portraying nude pictures was strictly not allowed. In fact the only mention of any adult pictures is Humphrey looking at the picture (which we as the audience can't see) and saying \"Wow your sister takes some interesting pictures\". This gets to be confusing as I didn't pick up the joke on first watch and got lost. However I rewinded and was fine. I still really wish they would have been allowed to show more than they did instead of watering down the more adult parts of the book. However, I have no reservation giving this a 9/10 it's earned. Hawkes Bogart and Bacall alone make this good but the supporting cast and writing is also very fine.",

There is almost nothing bad you can say about the film, the acting is superb with Bogart romancing his (soon-to-be) wife Lauren Bacall. Other fine acting is by Martha Vickers (the crazy older sister) and John Ridgely as the slimy Eddie Mars. They are accompanied by a fine collection of character actors who play their roles to perfection. The setting, Los Angeles just after World War II is a city of dreams and nightmares, sometimes both at the same time. The dialog sparkles. The violence is brutal and emotional. People gun other people down but it means something. The final confrontation between Bogart and Eddie Mars has an emotional intensity that few other films reach. The director, Howard Hawks, is now regarded as one of the greatest film directors of all time. There is not a wasted shot or misplayed scene in the film.The only problem with the film is that the plot is very complex and not well explained in the film. After seeing the film two or three times most things will be clear but even the screen-writer (William Faulkner) when asked to explain who killed a minor character allegedly exclaimed \"how the hell should I know?\".The scenes between Bogart and Bacall are priceless, they virtually define term \"good screen chemistry\" between an actor and an actress in a film. This film marked the continuation of a relationship which Bogart and Bacall had struck up during the filming of \"To Have and Have Not\". After that film, Bogart (who was married to another woman) broke off their love affair. However, they couldn't resist each other when they were cast together in this film. Bogart divorced and married Bacall following this film.",

But it somehow doesn't matter when you're swept along and thoroughly entertained by one great scene after another. I couldn't even begin to list my favorite scenes, there are so many, and some of the best movie dialogue of the era. While people tend to focus on the verbal sparring between Bogie and Bacall, there's a masterfully written exchange between Bogart and General Inwood that in just a few minutes gives you the sense of the entire life of this old, dissipated tycoon.As beautiful as Bacall was, for me Martha Vickers as her wayward younger sister almost steals the show. Vickers' character really pushes the boundaries of the Production Code, with hints of her involvement in drugs and pornography. Similarly risque, there's also the afternoon quickie between Bogart and Dorothy Malone's book clerk, in a classic \"you're beautiful when you let your hair down\" scene. (I know that Bogie's Marlowe is supposed to be cool, but it may be stretching things a bit the way all the women in the movie throw themselves at him, including the lady cabbie who gives him her business card. \"Call me at night. I work days.\")Probably in the end I would've been happier with less loose strings and plots contrivances, but this is a classic example of a movie where each scene has its own rewards. It's one of the most entertaining works of one of our greatest directors. Enjoy.",

Marlowe proceeds with his investigation and makes some shocking discoveries. He also seems to have good luck meeting attractive women, including Vivien Rutledge (Lauren Bacall).This movie is notorious for having a confusing plot. But the plot is really just basically Marlowe going about his investigation which leads him to various entertaining encounters. Not everything adds up in the end. But that is not the point. The point is just to have fun watching Marlowe trying to piece together whatever mystery Carmen got herself involved in.This is one of many great movies directed by Howard Hawks.

Between the two of them they comprise one of the hardest romantic couples I've ever seen. In the midst of the bizarre black mail and murder case, they fall in love. \"I'm in love with you I guess\" they say to each other. Harsh.In my younger days I would have celebrated this as content over form, substance over style. But it serves to remind that they truly don't make them like this anymore. Written in part by William Faulkner this is a movie you actually have to listen to. This contrasts with so many movies today -- the scripts are so bad you can nap for 10 minutes and not miss anything important. I actually saw \"That Thing You Do\" on a plane and did not spring the $3 for the earphones. I didn't miss a thing. Someone who had seen the movie asked me to tell them the story and, except for not knowing people's names, I could relay the entire story.But this is a movie carried by stars, not effects. I was almost surprised to see someone riddled by a machine gun and not even get a tear in their jacket. There are no exotic locations, no special effect. Yet the movie is gripping, drawing you in, daring you to figure things out as fast as Marlowe does. I could not keep up. Marlowe is also the smartest P.I. I've seen in a while. He throws a punch or two, but violence is not his tool. His tool is information. He gathers it, he keeps it, and he uses it (modern businessmen would say \"leverages\" it) to outmaneuver his opponents. Bacall is magical, as the steely and stunning Mrs. Rutledge. She does not scream or faint or cry once (except when asked to as part of a ruse). She holds her own and more. Watch for her as she half sits, half lays in Marlowe's car as they drive home from a casino. It's about time the love interest holds her won with the hero.Bogart's quick impersonation of a snobbish book collector alone makes seeing this a must.",

It became complex and intriguing all at the same time, you have multiple characters all with multiple motives. It can get confusing, so paying attention is required. The film's cinematography was interesting because I especially focused on the women. I felt that they were portrayed very much like a stereotypical woman in this time period. Most in the film were always very \"dolled up\" for every occasion. I felt that the woman even when they were not in the main focus of the shot helped create the background.

Hawk's tackled a detective film in such a masterful way that lead to great situational comedy and witty banter. Humphrey Bogart takes the role of Philip Marlow, a hard working detective just trying to make ends meet. His mannerisms correctly portrayed the role of a detective in the given time period. The character of Mr. Marlow was perfectly written for Bogart and his new love interest; Vivian, played by the ever charming Lauren Bacall. The fast paced dialogue and ever expanding plot line created an exciting atmosphere that was plush with a spellbinding romance. Carmen, portrayed by a young Martha Vickers, plays an amazing foil to the \"uptight\" Vivan. As the movie progresses the viewer learns that Vivan too has a wild side. Hawk's expert craftsmanship and eye for detail is delicately laced throughout the whole film; from the doubling of characters to the distinct mannerisms each character portrayed. Overall I thoroughly enjoyed the work, although I felt at some points the plot stretched on just a little too much. However, with comical exchanges such as: Vivian: I don't like your manners. Marlowe: And I'm not crazy about yours. I didn't ask to see you. I don't mind if you don't like my manners, I don't like them myself. They are pretty bad. I grieve over them on long winter evenings. I don't mind your ritzing me drinking your lunch out of a bottle. But don't waste your time trying to cross-examine me. (IMDb.com) it's hard to not enjoy this film.",

Bogart gives a smooth performance, as do all of the actors. The only bad thing about the movie was that some of it was a little tough to follow. For example, when the main character investigates inside of a car and looks at a tag on the steering column. I had to back it up to see what it said, but I still wasn't quite sure what it was supposed to mean. There were a few other things like that throughout the movie. Also there were a lot of names thrown around and I was never quite able to get a grip on who was who. Eventually it doesn't really matter because the plot goes where it's going to go whether or not you understand, and even if you didn't catch everything that happened you are still able to understand the story's resolution. But still, stuff like that gets annoying and I feel like the filmmakers could have done a better job making things clear. Overall it's still an entertaining film and I did like it.",

The depth of the plot makes it hard to comprehend what is taking place in the film. Although, the film was still enjoyable. Although the film is basically about a criminal investigation, there's a sexy/romantic feel that I think makes the film appealing to a larger audience, than the typical \"action\" film. The Big Sleep is a great film noir, and it's play with light, makes it easy to appreciate that it's black and white. Howard Hawks is know for his remarkable films, and although I wish this one fell into that category, it just didn't for me. The cinematography and overall feel of the film is good, but to me, it's nothing that hasn't been done before.",

This film is another example of a film noir with its dark and rainy scenes as well as all of the sneaking around everyone seemed to be doing. As for the technical part of it; it seemed to me that some of the scenes were very obvious that they were fake or a set. Therefore, I wish a little more effort was put into the overall look of the scenes. Other than that the camera shots were very clear due to the lighting and \"mysterious\" look the movie was going for.",

The best romantic part of the movie as when Bogart was tied up with a cigarette in his mouth. He ask Bacall to take the cigarette out of his mouth and of course they kiss. A short time later she helps him take out a killer and he responds, \"They certainly don't make them like that anymore.\" The action in the movie was okay. It was very suspenseful and they shooting scenes were good. The fist fighting scenes were unrealistic and you could tell that it was fake acting.

            "content": "To be honest, it would take a month of Sundays to unravel the plotline to The Big Sleep and that, apparently, after parts of the director's cut were significantly re-scripted and shot to take advantage of the public's fascination with Bogie and Bacall. (And am I glad they did that.) At one stage, the plot had got so complicated that Chandler was asked to clarify a point. Chandler had to admit he didn't know either!Basically, an elderly General calls in Humphrey Bogart, playing Raymond Chandler's famous private detective Philip Marlowe in the character's first cinematic outing, to stop his younger daughter, Carmen, from being blackmailed yet again for gambling debts. He is stopped by the General's elder daughter Vivian, played very maturely by Lauren Bacall considering she was only 20/21, before he can leave, believing her father has hired him for something else. There is already a spark of \"Will they, won't they?\"Marlowe stakes out the blackmailer's bookshop and follows him to his home. Staking the home out, he sees Carmen arrive and later hears a gunshot and a woman's scream and sees two cars speed away. Inside the house he finds Carmen out of her brain on drugs and/or alcohol and the bookshop owner dead on the floor. A secret camera is revealed, minus its film.The storyline starts to get complicated when Marlowe's police informer tells him that the General's chauffer is about to be fished out of the river, evidently murdered before he drove into the water...Having solved the problem of Carmen and having received a handsome cheque from the General in return, Marlowe discovers that Vivian has problems of her own; she is being blackmailed by the owner of the casino she goes to! Vivian also begins to pop up everywhere, rendering some of the storyline meaningless, contradictory and impossible to follow.A number of re-writes meant that the cinema theatre version wasn't released until 1946, rendering wartime references, but no direct mention of the war, confusing too. This was to bolster the onscreen relationship of Bogart and Bacall (and, by now, offscreen relationship as they had married in May 1945). A 1997 release of the original 1945 version of the film confirmed that this had been a case where \"studio interference\" was exactly the right thing.Bogart and Bacall just sizzle together. Whereas the interaction between Marlowe's character and Carmen early on in the film lead to typical Bogart/Marlowe throwaway lines such as the brilliant \"She tried to sit in my lap while I was standing up\", Bogart and Bacall's verbal warfare, sometimes delivered at an overlapping, frantic pace, and often inuendo-filled dialogue simply draws you into their relationship. Bogart had encouraged Bacall to steal scenes in To Have and To Have Not and many of the scenes in this film had Carmen's involvement shaved down. However, when you slink about in subtle shoulderpads, scratch a crossed leg or two, deliver \"The Look\" and the sultry, smoky voice, and give the general appearance of being as much an antihero to the general film studio 'glamour factory' as Katherine Hepburn (making them firm friends by the time of the filming of Bogart and Hepburn's African Queen), frankly, my dear, who gives a damn?!Brilliant scenes such as when Vivian sashays into Marlowe's office speak for themselves:So you do get up? I was beginning to think perhaps you worked in bed like Marcel Proust.Who's he?You wouldn't know him. A French writer.Come into my boudoir...-Do you want to tell me now?Tell you what?What it is you're trying to find out. You know, it's a funny thing. You're trying to find out what your father hired me to find out. And I'm trying to find out why you want to find out.You could go on forever, couldn't you?Anyway, it'll give us something to talk about next time we meet.And the ultimate in inuendo in the caf\u00e9:\n-Speaking of horses, I like to play them myself. But I like to see them work out a little first, see if they're front runners or come from behind, find out what their hole card is, what makes them run.Find out mine?I think so.I'd say you don't like to be rated. You like to get out in front, open up a little lead, take a little breather in the backstretch, and then come home free.You don't like to be rated yourself.I haven't met anyone yet that can do it. Any suggestions?Well, I can't tell till I've seen you over a distance of ground. You've got a touch of class, but I don't know how far you can go.A lot depends on who's in the saddle.But my ultimate favourite scene in this film isn't any dialogue, it's Bacall singing at the casino. Even though she isn't supported by a famous musician/pianist like Hoagy Carmichael as she was in To Have and To Have Not or Dooley Wilson as Sam in Bogart's Casablanca, she is allegedly supported by the Williams Brothers, including a young Andy Williams who must have had his back to the camera. Bacall delivers such an upbeat version of And Her Tears Flowed Like Wine that you almost completely forget the dark undertones of the lyrics: \"He socked her in the choppers\" and \"She's a real sad tomato, she's a busted valentine.\" It tells the story of a two-timing guy with a string of girlfriends. I don't think it refers to Vivian's jealousy at Marlowe being called in to solve her younger sister's problems, as that has just been resolved and wouldn't advance the plot. It may refer to Vivian's character as we are about to learn that she is being blackmailed for gambling debts as much as her younger sister. It may even refer ironically to Bogart and Bacall in real life and their open and adult relationship, having just got married and there being a 25 year age gap between them, and going on to remain married until Bogart's death at the end of the 50s - all this as Vivien looks on at Marlowe eying up the cigarette girls and cheerily waving to him and evidently wishing him good luck in that department. Or maybe it was a pleasant interlude - which it is - with a popular jazzy number of the time.Oh, and another thing. Call it the Rosie the Riveter effect, but every time Bogart turns around, there's another devastating woman. In addition to Carmen and Vivian, he comes across not one but two arch bookstore shop assistants (one who doesn't want anything to do with him and the other who positively throws herself at him), a cab-driving dame who tells him she's his gal and to call her in the evenings because she works days, flirty cocktail waitresses and the said cigarette girls. There are more B-list ingenues than you can shake a stick at and who appear to have got work in this manly film noir than in any of a dozen women's pictures from the same year.What is about ugly male film stars, too? Bogart, Clark Gable and Fred Astaire were all at the back of the queue when it came to dishing out the looks, but they still interest us. Even glamourous yet plain actresses like Bacall, Katherine Hepburn and Bette Davis could also outshine the likes of Marylin Monroe and Audrey Hepburn and make the camera like them for their depth of character to intrigue and fascinate us.I enjoyed seeing this film again, even if it did end up for the 'Bogart and Bacall' effect rather than the storyline. But, having read the background to the film, maybe that ended up as the full intention of the film, anyway. I could go on about who Mr Routledge was (Bacall's character is Mrs Routledge) but we learn even less about him than we do about the General's 'prot\u00e9g\u00e9' Sean Regan whom Carmen is supposed to have murdered. I also missed the bit where Marlowe ends up gaining a key to the murdered bookshop owner's house. But, hey, that might just be a reason to watch the film again.",

It is essential noir in any format, the BluRay brings out more detail and sharpness, more vivid noir style solid blacks and grays, and was reportedly restored frame by frame. This applies to the version released in Feb 1946. The disc also has the pre-release version that was almost distributed in 1945, but this version remains in 480i resolution. The changes, shot in Jan of 1946, make the film from a good one into a great one in my estimation. It adds more of the \"To Have And Have Not\" innuendo laced snappy dialog between LB and HB. Roughly 15 minutes of new scenes were shot in one week in Jan of 46, all of which were cobbled together with parts of the existing 45 version, and the result is a noir masterpiece. It is difficult not to be distracted by the dazzling B&W photography, or Lauren's sultry beauty, but this film must be attentively viewed to follow the plot. The plot is not as byzantine as some make it out to be, you must merely pay close attention. This is noir in all its glory- replete with the men in snappy suits, the women in flowing gowns and form fitting dresses. Even the hoods are well dressed. The improved soundtrack on the BluRay disc makes Lauren's voice even more sultry, and her incredible beauty more mesmerizing. Bogie is at his wise-cracking, tough guy best. Surrounded by an excellent supporting cast, and directed by Howard Hawks, this is an absolutely essential addition to any film noir collection.",
