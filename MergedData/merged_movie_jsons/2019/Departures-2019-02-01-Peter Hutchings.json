            "content": "The first half of the movie, I previously thought, was superficial. Skye and Calvin had so much dynamics together yet it could have been executed in a way that viewers could find it more profound. While Maisie Williams had an amazing performance, Asa Butterfield's acting fluctuates throughout the movie.However, the second half shows why it deserves a 10 stars for me. In theatre, this type of illness-death story has been told plenty of times, creating a good number of conventions and cliche for the genre. This movie gives you something completely different. It depicts a beautiful and wonderful platonic friendship that people have rarely seen even though we desperately need one (despite the fact that deep down inside, we still ship them because of the chemistry they had together). In addition, it deals with cancer and death in the most brutal yet very blunt and honest way, which hits you really hard at your emotion.I love the direction it chose to take. It's cute and vibrant and filled with energy, even till the last minute of the movie, despite how tough the problem they were dealing with.Personally, as a person around their age who is also working on figuring out myself, I relate to them considerably and feel inspired significantly by this movie. It's an important one. One that I would love to recommend to everyone.",

            "content": "A comedy about cancer, it's always delicate to make a movie like that, especially since almost everybody had to deal with cancer at one point in his life, maybe not personally but we all know somebody dear to us that died or suffered from cancer. But since the show The Big C it's proven that it can work. At first the character of Skye played by Maisie Williams annoyed me a bit but the more I grew with the movie the more you could understand her point of view, trying to make the best out of the little time she still had in her life. First I thought they didn't show enough of the nasty stuff that comes with cancer but in the end it wasn't a bad move as it's supposed to be a romantic comedy, a sad one nonetheless. I had some laughs and tears, just what I expected from a movie like this one, as it brought up some memories from lost friends that died of cancer. Then Came You surprised me, especially since I didn't expected much of it.",

His work in this film is no different.The story lacks substance in some parts, but throughout the movie, you grow attached to the relationship between Butterfield (Calvin) and Maisie Williams (Skye.) The story is cheesy in parts and at times Williams put me off, but there's no denying Butterfield's depth of character in that he conveys emotion so well, albeit awkwardly at times and makes the viewer fond of him.The film contains some great heart-warming moments, some which we can all identify with while still providing the occasional laugh.",

That is an outright lie. The only sound heard was groaning. including from my daughter who is from the prime target demographic.\nSeriously, even 14 year old girls are aware they are being spoon fed saccharine junk if you pile on enough clich\u00e9s and worn out tropes.And 23 \"ten\" votes ere out of 32 votes?

Similar stories have been done in movies several times in recent years. \"Then Came You\" doesn't make it to the level of \"Me and Earl and the Dying Girl\", but it's still worth the watch. In \"Me and Earl and the Dying Girl\", I found the characters much more unique and realistic. Maisie's and Asa's performances did carry the film though. I wished they would have delved more into the way Maisie's character felt abandoned by her friends. I liked the way they started out with the scene with her three girl friends ignoring her. They were having a hard time dealing with the fact that she was dying. But later on, they seemed to get over it, and we never really saw how that happened. We saw Maisie drinking heavily at a party. I thought it may interfere with her meds and she may have a seizure. Instead she just threw up out in the street with Asa and seemed to genuinely have a good time at the party. I think they had some missed opportunities to make the characters more unique and real. But I still thought both Asa and Maisie did a great job with the script they were given. I did think the flight attendant seemed a bit old for Asa. She said there was 3 years difference, but it looked almost like a teacher and student type of thing.I do think this was a good performance for Maisie. It was worth the watch.

She has come along way from that little girl warrior we saw in the GOT Pilot..The plot, the writing, character development, etcetera.

            "content": "Everyone has a bucket list of some kind. A terminal illness adds urgency in fulfilling what is on that bucket list. Sometimes it can't be done without help from very special friends and family. \"Then Came You\" is about a teenager named Skye, played by Maisie Williams, who is dealing with a terminal illness. Along comes, Calvin played by Asa Butterfield who thinks he has just about every illness that is out there. The two meet at a cancer support group.A contributing factor to Calvin's hypochondria was the death of his twin sister several years before in an auto accident that also left their mother in a severely depressed state. To help deal with his phobia Calvin attends the cancer support group. Then comes Skye, a Spitfire free-spirited young lady that makes an instant connection with the very studious no-nonsense Calvin. Although the connection seems to be one-way at first, Skye pushed on to gain Calvin's friendship by going to his work at the local airport where Calvin works as a baggage handler. Her daily visits then begin to rub off on him and soon Calvin gains his confidence back and loses his hypochondria along the way as he helps Skye fulfill her bucket list.The movie is a great example of what true friendship is. No doubt it is a tearjerker and Maisie Williams is amazing as Skye and carry's the movie all the way to her conclusion. Asa's performance, however, came across as bored. There were a few scenes where Asa looked as if he was somewhere else. His piercing blue eyes rolled a few times whenever Maisie delivered her lines. There was some chemistry between the two actors, but not enough to care what happens to Calvin and his love interest Izzy a stewardess played by Nina Dobrev. Her performance was also flat and one dimensional. I found it hard to believe that Izzy would fall for a guy that looked almost ten years younger than she was. One last thing, who's idea was it for Calvin to show Skye the coffin he made for her. Choosing a coffin was on her bucket list. Calvin made Skye a promise to help her complete that list. I think Skye just knowing that Calvin had taken care of that item would have been enough without being too creepy.The movie was released direct to video in February.",

            "content": "Then Came You is a romantic drama directed by Peter Hutchings, the director of Cool Girls and Rhymes with Banana.The film is about the teenager Calvin (Asa Butterfield). He works in the baggage department of an airport. He is suffering from hypochondria. He often thinks that he is wrongly sick or that something is wrong with him physically. This way he lives a quiet life and is otherwise very alone.\nWhen he meets the terminally ill teenager Skye (Maisie Williams) she changes his life. Despite her illness, Skye is positive and tries to complete a Bucket List in her uncertain life. She calls her Bucket List to-die-list. In this way she encourages Calvin to help her with her list and suggests that he also tries to overcome his own fears. With each other's help, they take on their own fears and impossible challenges and actions.This film comes across as a teenage version of the movie The Bucket List, where two terminally ill men also make a Bucket List together and try to finish it completely before they die. The film also looks like a lesser version of The Fault in Our Stars, because they made that film in a more serious way.\nThen Came You was unfortunately written by a novice script writer, which can mainly be seen by older viewers. Things happen in the film that may seem unrealistic to adult viewers. Agents who are friends with Calvin and Skye, for example, are stuck with people who may not even have done something wrong just to make their friends laugh. Comedy actor Ken Jeong himself plays one of the agents.\nMany other different comedy moments also seem somewhat predictable and are therefore no longer funny for many. The many comedy moments in the film also flood the drama aspects, making them appear somewhat weak. The parents of Skye and Calvin do provide the best drama moments in the film, but because they are not very present in the film, these scenes also seem a bit too weak.The acting work is also known by the lesser script, the cast does not make much better of it. Asa Butterfield, Maisie Williams and Nina Dobrev are good actors and have already proven this with roles in other films and TV series. Asa Butterfield and Maisie Williams appear realistic as good friends trying to help each other with their problems. Unfortunately, due to the situations they are experiencing, it sometimes seems a bit too forced. The romantic relationships between Asa Butterfield and Nina Dobrev appear completely forced and then all the way through the twists that they make together in their relationship.",

The only original thing about this film would be that it tries to be funny and optimistic and in contrast to other protagonists, Skye handles herself quite well despite her sickness. Unfortunately, that doesn't provide and interesting enough plot for this to be an original movie. The setting is also quite confusing. For the first half an hour or so I thought this was happening at Heathrow Airport but apparently not, as it is later revealed. Kids with cancer is such a clich\u00e9, even if it is a sad one.

She has a To Die List and he's too afraid to live.Maisie Williams is the Manic Pixie Dying Girl and Dobrev is the Less-Manic Pixie Dream Girl. The movie is doing too much and Maisie Williams is trying too hard. It throws all the dying girl tropes into this including former best friend, grieving parents, and hot guy lust. Then Asa Butterfield has his own set of issues. The saving grace is the loveable duo. They're lovely actors. It is odd to have two British actors acting as Americans although at least Maisie get to be British until she was ten. Even Dobrev is lovely here. Everybody is lovely except Ken Jeong who is, like the movie, trying too hard. The movie hits all the emotional beats on their heads. They would better off giving everything to Asa and Maisie and have them hang out by themselves. It's a simple Cyrano de Bergerac movie with cancer. It doesn't need all of the wacky cop, depressed mom, the dead sister, or former best friend. It's trying too hard.",

            "content": "There are many people in the world who find it much more challenging to live than to die. As William Wallace famously says, \"Every man dies, but not every man really lives.\"So many people toil and suffer, fearful of every day and what it might bring. Calvin is such a man. He lives out a mediocre and basically meaningless life working at the airport. He's also a hypochonriac who's convinced he has cancer or that he's always ill with some disease. He reminds me of Cameron from \"Ferris Bueller's Day Off.\" He's happiest when he thinks he's sick. He doesn't have any real friends, and it's clear that he just tries to get through each day.Enter Skye, a vibrant young woman who embraces Life and what time she has left. She's terminally ill with cancer, and yet she refuses to let the illness stop her or deprive her of life's experiences. She meets Calvin at a cancer support group. For some reason, Calvin's doctor thought it would do him good to see what it's like for people who actually have the disease. Skye is a whirlwind of energy, and she soon captivates Calvin.In short, Skye uses the time she has left to teach Calvin how to live. To not be afraid. To embrace life's challenges and also to try his best to live his dreams.The relationship and chemistry between Asa Butterfield and Maisie Williams is perfect, and they counter each other very well. Butterfield's Calvin comes off as shy, quiet, and introverted. Willaims's Skye is loud, obnoxious, and extroverted. A perfect balance.As Calvin begins to learn how to live, he also begins to appreciate the gift that Skye has brought him. She doesn't even get angry that he's pretending to have cancer. Perhaps it's because she gets it. She understands, even she thinks it's silly.The only part of the movie that doesn't really work is with the character of Izzy. (Nina Dobrev). The chemistry between Dobrev and Butterfield just isn't there, and it made their romantic bond seem unrealistic. I wanted more of Calvin and Skye. Izzy would have made more sense at the end of the film. Perhaps Calvin finally decides to do something about it. But then, I'm sure Dobrev would never have accepted such a small role. Izzy simply doesn't work for the story as a whole. I'm also tired of seeing characters (for some reason, they tend to be mostly women) who stomp off angrily without demanding an explanation for deception. I don't know many people who would do that. It makes no sense. If someone you care about deceives you, you want to know why.Butterfield and Williams are clearly the strength of the movie. The film has some very humorous situations as well as moments that might tug at your heartstrings.Most people should take a note from this movie. Stop being afraid to live. Stop taking shelter in your comfort zone. As someone once said, \"A comfort zone is a beautiful place, but nothing ever grows there.\" We don't know how much time we have. Make the most of it. Live as though you only have one day left.",

Instead they loaded the movie with a slew of out of place characters (the police officers and flight attendants specifically). Also the slow motion scenes with music in the background got old after awhile.Nina Dobrev is eight years older than Asa Butterfield, so it's too much of a stretch to think they would have any spark. Butterfield is always typecast as an awkward character, too. I think he's a fine actor, but he doesn't have much room to shine here. Maisie Williams had a chance to show off here, she's cute and has tremendous energy.In terms of the actual storyline and character development for a 90 minute film, I can't complain. I didn't have any urge to turn it off. I would recommend it for younger adults and their families.",

They talk about Calvin's past related stuff but you don't really feel for him in particular until the very end where other characters' actions affect his life.Cinematography is decent, shots are nice and song choices are also fine but the major drawback of the film still remains that it doesn't try to go above and beyond.",

            "content": "The movie wasn't all too bad, but there were quite a few holes in it that kept me from being more invested in a story with such a serious subject. Not saying it wasn't enjoyable, but there were issues that could've been addressed (possibly even in editing) to leave me feeling more affected by the story and its characters rather than cheated out of my time.\nSkye and Calvin meet in an interesting way, but soon there afterwards it's as though Skye has some sort of curiosity with Calvin, but it's never clarified as to what that is, what compels her to keep poking and prodding him, in wanting to be around him. If it was meant to be apparent to the audience without being vocal, it was lost.\nSkye seems to be someone who has accepted her fate and tries to make the most out of every minute she has left, so why hang around some awkward, disinterested, slightly negative person who wants nothing to do with her? The answer: because... ....reasons...?\nAfter Calvin suddenly accepts that Skye won't leave him be, they launch into a Bucket List montage where they are goofing around, laughing and smiling as though they've been friends for years. This is where is where it really started to fall apart for me because there was no build up to how they got to be this close to each other; from being slightly-less-distant strangers to best buds tackling each other on the lawn and laughing. There's no chemistry that lead us to understand this behaviour or how they got to suddenly be this close over ...hours? ...days (at best)? There's no timeline to even know. So why am I being led to think this should be believable?\nWhich brings me to my next point: no one knows how much time passes during this film. Maybe that was intentional in tying into the theme of Skye's terminal illness. We never know how much time we have so let's not inform the audience about how much time passes in the movie. Okay, sure, buuuuut.....\nKen Jeong plays officer Al who pops up a little here and there in the film. He cuts Skye and Calvin a lot of slack for the things they get caught doing all because he has seen them in the same cancer support group his father attends. While we know Skye has attended these meetings more than once, we also find out Calvin's doctor suggested he attend one meeting once in an effort to help out his hypochondria. We see this, but ONLY this one meeting. It's unclear if he continued to go to them because he soon gets caught in his unwillingness to come forward and correct people (like officer Al) that he doesn't have cancer. Furthermore, there's no insight as to why Calvin lies about this.\nAnd Calvin's sudden dancing...? Please, don't even get me started on his dancing...\nAs the movie progresses, Calvin supposedly starts \"coming out of his shell\", but again, no insight as to why. Oh, it's because of Skye? Ok, how? What specifically is he getting from her that he hasn't been getting from anything else for the vast majority of his life? Where's the insight into that? Nowhere. It just happens and we're supposed to swallow it as it's force fed to us just like the montage that came before. You would think for a character that's finally finding himself in such a way (so quickly) that he would also be willing to man up and admit his false cancer, but no. Why? Again: reasons.\nWhile the movie did start to feel like it held more of an impact near the last 1/3 of its life with Skye becoming more ill than ever, I feel it was too late for any audience member to become any more invested in this story and its characters. All those loose threads which had been swept under a rug and somehow supposed to have left us feeling emotionally involved and attached to these characters make for a bumpy and unsatisfying ending.\nYou never see too much aside from sadness and tears from any character on how they deal with Skye dying. You don't see the other emotions, no frustration, no anger, no sudden lashing out. Aside from one brief hallway scene in the hospital with Calvin and his brother where his brother says essentially \"It's not about you it's about her...\" Now man up, suppress any emotions you have and move on. Because cancer is only ever about those with cancer...? Never the ones that are affected around them...? Again, whatever message I'm supposed to get from this is lost, I'm just supposed to take it because of (say it with me now): reasons!\nAnd then Skye dies. We don't see how it affects anyone, we don't see people mourning, we don't get even the slightest hint of what any of the characters we've met and watched for over the last hour are feeling or reacting. You see Skye alive one minute and then Calvin visiting her tombstone the next. So if anyone in the audience did somehow manage to get attached to these two main characters up to now, guess what? You get no resolution, no closure, no follow through to what they'd been leading up to because REASONS!\nOh, and for some reason there is a love interest for Calvin which doesn't pan out or lead to anything interesting - AND - Calvin has a mother who \"shut down\" after Calvin's twin sister died when he was 8 .... and I guess she's still around after the movie ends, unaffected. Not sure what her relevance in the movie was really about when you see her on screen for MAYBE a whole minute throughout the films entirety and no social interaction from anyone else in the film. I feel like this was a wasted opportunity to take a broken character in Calvin's life and bring them to light, comparing their mental illness to Skye's in such a dark time. But hey, you know.....\nI usually enjoy films with Asa Butterfield and I've enjoyed watching Maisie Williams on Game of Thrones so I figured from the preview of this film and its subject matter that this would have been a great film to watch. In the end I feel like there was some sloppy directing, poor writing, and bad editing (but not so much as no amount of editing could be done to fill the holes in this cheesecloth of a film).\nThanks to Ken Jeong and Tituss Burgess for adding a bit of comedic flare here and there in the movie, otherwise I'd give this film probably a 3/10.",

I didn't see the trailer, didn't bother seeing reviews, and frankly it doesn't even matter now. The way actors have portrayed the characters, it was like a cool breeze on a hot summer day.Sometimes you wait for a film to release, and find it annoying.Then you come across certain work that you didn't knew existed.Refreshing and different.For some reason, I like this and not 'The fault in our stars'.Is it normal ?",
