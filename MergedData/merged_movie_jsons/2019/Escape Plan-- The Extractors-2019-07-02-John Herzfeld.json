            "content": "They should have stopped after the first movie. Whereas the 2013 movie \"Escape Plan\" was actually good, the 2018 sequel \"Escape Plan 2: Hades\" and now the 2019 \"Escape Plan: The Extractors\" have been abysmal, to put it bluntly.The storyline in \"Escape Plan: The Extractors\" was just pointless, and it even seemed that none of the cast actually bought into the plot, script and storyline here either. Just what were writers Miles Chapman and John Herzfeld thinking here? How did this script actually make it to become a movie?The movie is monotonous, and that is actually putting it mildly. There is no adrenaline kicks throughout the movie, and it quickly settled into a boring trot and never got out of that mundane gutter. Yet, I managed to endure the ordeal, as this is a Sylvester Stallone movie after all. Not one of his best movies, not even by a longshot.It was actually Devon Sawa whom carried the movie here with his performance, as he was the one that had the most screen time, the most energy and the most on-screen presence, whereas the likes of Sylvester Stallone, Dave Bautista and Jin Zhang were just autopiloting their way through this movie at the hands of director John Herzfeld.\"Escape Plan: The Extractors\" not only lacked a proper storyline, it also lacked character motivation and the ability to engage the audience. The entire movie just felt like a copy/paste job quickly put together for the sake of cashing in on the franchise before it is too late.By skipping out on watching \"Escape Plan: The Extractors\" you will not be missing anything vital to the franchise. This 2019 movie wasn't really worth the time or money invested into it. As such, my rating for it is a mere three out of ten stars.",

            "content": "ESCAPE PLAN 3 is of much the same quality as part two in the series, which is to say that it's not very good. The first time was a proper fun action movie, light and forgettable, whereas these follow-ups are B-movie cash-ins, nothing more. The prominent presence of Stallone on the cover is misleading too, because he tends to have little screen time and ends up a supporting actor in his (supposed) own movie.The plot of this one is entirely muddled, with an evil kidnapper hiding out in the dark and dingy confines of an old prison and our heroes having to go in an rescue their loved ones. A bunch of once-famous faces are included for no real reason, and others like 50 Cent barely register. While I was pleased to see Zhang Jin in the cast (MASTER Z: IP MAN LEGACY being a recent favourite of mine), his fight scenes, although hard-hitting, are slightly spoilt by dodgy editing which detracts from the choreography. Better are Dave Bautista and Stallone himself, both of whom get a brutal fight to themselves, although you have to wait towards the end to view them. The rest isn't particularly worth bothering with.",

What happened to Stallone escaping OUT of prisons? Where was the tech and gadgetry for the \"extraction\"? Oh wait, exploding fire bullets? Pshhh give me a break. Then add major plot and scene issues. Again, lazy writing. The directing was lousy with terrible camera work and editing. The score was annoying and out of place. Basically an all-around cheap C-grade production, that even the original great lead cast couldn't save. The martial arts fight scenes were choreographed really well, but it felt like director John Herzfeld had shaky hands recording with his iPhone4. It's a shame this one couldn't even compare to the first film. The 2nd film was even better than this one. It's a very generous 5/10 from me - mainly for Stallone, Bautista, and the 5 mins we saw 50 Cent.",

            "review_title": "Another Superficial Escape Plan",
            "content": "Sylvester Stallone movies can be fun. In Swedish director Mikael H\u00e5fstr\u00f6m's \"Escape Plan\" (2013), Arnold Schwarzenegger co-starred with Stallone, and these two legends collaborated to break out of an impregnable black site prison. The last-minute revelation about the prison's mysterious whereabouts capped this imaginative cat & mouse suspense saga. Stallone and Schwarzenegger contended with the smart but ruthless Warden Hobbes (Jim Caviezel of CBS-TV's \"Person of Interest\"), who kept close tabs on their shenanigans. The $55 million \"Escape Plan\" coughed up $25 million domestically but generated $112-million overseas! Reportedly, the lucrative Chinese box office prompted Summit Entertainment to slap together back-to-back sequels. Stallone reprises his role as Ray Breslin. A former criminal prosecutor turned prison security expert, Breslin is a past master at escaping from the most foolproof prisons. His Houdini-like talent for breaking out of the tightest prison intimidates wardens.In director Steven C. Miller's \"Escape Plan 2: Hades\" (2018), Breslin landed in a totally automated black site prison where a robotic physician attended to the inmates' health. In \"15 Minutes\" director John Herzfeld's \"Escape Plan 3: Extractors,\" Breslin breaks into the prison! Basically, WCW wrestler Dave Bautista has replaced Schwarzenegger as Stallone's ace-in-the-hole. Bautista's character strikes from without to within, while Stallone works in reverse. Bautista's heavily armed goon appears with miraculous punctuality to link up with Stallone. Aside from Stallone, Curtis \"50 Cent\" Jackson's bespectacled computer nerd Hush is the only other original cast member, but his presence is peripheral. Jamie King is back from \"Escape Plan 2: Hades\" as Stallone's love interest, but their relationship is ill-fated. Victory walks arm-in-arm with sacrifice.Although he has top billing, Stallone doesn't dominate the histronics as much as his Chinese co-stars. Mind you, he spends more time on screen here than in \"Escape Plan 2: Hades.\" Two factors distinguish \"Escape Plan\" from its quickie sequels. First, both sequels clock in considerably shorter than the two-hour \"Escape Plan.\" \"Escape Plan 2\" ran 94 minutes, while \"Escape Plan 3: Extractors\" saves time at 88 minutes. Indeed, the end credits take up ten minutes, with the conflict depicted in 78 minutes. Interestingly, \"Road House 2: Last Call\" scenarist Miles Chapman emphasizes \"Extractors'\" ties to the original. Not only did he pen \"Escape Plan,\" but he also wrote both sequels. Primarily, Chapman splits the episodic action up between Ray and Trent as well as the two Chinese bodyguards who are captivated by Daya. If you've seen \"Escape Plan,\" you may remember Ray Breslin's unscrupulous partner, Lester Clark (Vincent D'Onofrio of \"Full Metal Jacket\"), who supervised the logistics of putting Breslin into prisons with a fake identity. In \"Escape Plan,\" Clark double-crossed Breslin, but his treachery cost him his life. He dies screaming in a cargo ship plying an anonymous sea. As it turns out, the \"Extractors\" villain is Lester's obnoxious son, Lester Clark, Jr. (Devon Sawa of \"Final Destination\"), and he wants payback! This is reminiscent of \"Die Hard\" and \"Die Hard with A Vengeance\" where the brother of the original villain challenges the heroes.The daughter of a billionaire Chinese business mogul, Daya Zhang (Melise of \"The Shannara Chronicles\"), wants to invest in the post-industrial town of Mansfield, Ohio. She argues their corporation-- Zhang Innovations--can revive the local economy. Moreover, Daya assures her father, Wu Zhang (Russell Wong of \"New Jack City\"), that the investment will improve the company's worldwide brand image. No sooner have city officials vowed to accommodate Daya than a team of mysterious gunmen disguised as an airport ground crew kidnap Daya. Despite the best laid plans of Daya's alert bodyguard, Bao Yung (Harry Shum, Jr. of \"Crazy Rich Asians\"), he finds himself outnumbered and outgunned. The villains knock Bao senseless, and Lester Clark, Jr., plants a flash drive on him with Ray Breslin's name. Naturally, Wu Zhang is furious about his daughter's abduction.\nMeantime, a stranger, Shen Lo (Jin Zhang of \"Pacific Rim: Uprising\"), provokes a brawl in Breslin's office. He wields a rolled-up umbrella as a weapon and floors Breslin's bodyguards. No sooner has Shen eliminated all resistance than Breslin gets the drop on him. Shen Lo hands Ray a disk with data about Daya's whereabouts. At this point, we learn Wu Zhang's company built the prison in \"Escape Plan,\" and the Saudis commission a similar facility in the desert. According to Shen Lo, Wu has reaped billions from incarcerating and torturing innocent people by the thousands. Shen probes Ray about Lester senior's connection to Wu Zhang. Shen vows to topple Zhang. Moreover, Shen was once Daya's bodyguard, but his romantic sentiments prompted Wu to fire him. Sadly, Herzfeld and Chapman never elaborates about this subplot in an actioneer where public displays of affection are minimal.Shen and Bao tag along with Ray to rescue Daya. Meantime, Ray contacts Trent DeRosa (Dave Bautista of \"Spectre\"), and he identifies the prison where Lester's son has Daya as 'the Devil's Station' in Latvia. Ray and his girlfriend Abigail (Jamie King of \"Escape Plan 2: Hades\") are poised to leave when Junior's men surprise Ray and snatch Abigail out from under Ray's nose. Meantime, Shen isn't the only one who wants to destroy Wu Zhang. Junior demands $700 million from the Hong Kong patriarch. In the complex Miles Chapman & John Herzfeld screenplay, Lester has grabbed Abigail to give Ray another reason to come to him. Our heroes enter the dilapidated prison without fanfare via the sewer. Ray carves up one of Lester's roughneck henchmen with a bloody knife. Fireworks erupt as Shen and Bao trip the alarms in the 'Devil's Station.' Lester's trigger-happy henchmen capture Shen and Bao, but they don't remain long in captivity. Meantime, Trent ambles nonchalantly into the rugged prison with a fearsome shotgun and blasts away at the unsuspecting felons.Director John Herzfeld stages some agile hand-to-hand combat scenes that compensate for the expository boilerplate scenes. Altogether, \"Escape Plan 3: Extractors\" generates more intrigue than \"Escape Plan 2: Hades,\" but neither overshadows the original \"Escape Plan.\"",

            "content": "Escape Plan 3: The Extractors Another horrendeous RANT on a peace stinker DTV sequel garbage from Stallone!Another movie that Stallone did belongs in the trash. I like the first Escape Plan and in that movie Ray Breslin played by Stallone was not a violent person in this movie he is a stone cold killer. I couldn't finish this movie. It was boring as hell, colors were again yellow like someone pie on the camera. Plot is a mess and makes no logic at all. Again Chinese people are in this movie again just like in Escape Plan 2: Hades. What is up with Sly nowdays about Chinese people? I don't get it.This movie is garbage, it has shaky cam just like in Part 2. The cam moves up and down like you have a migrene! I don't want to watch Escape Plan 2 and 3 ever again! I did finish Hades, this movie I gave up. The plot is about a guy from the first movie getting revenge on Sly so he kiddnaps Sly's gf and another Chinese girl and he extortion a rich Chinese man. Stallone looks like a fat whale and he barely moves and walks. Is Stallone turning in to a Steven Seagal wannabe nowdays? Russell Wong is in this movie and I loved him in Vanishing Son I, II and III, even in series I loved him. Russell is really old and he is not a bad-ass martial artist like he was in Vanishing Son. Did Stallone try to imitate and copy the movie Fortress (1992) with Christopher Lambert in Hades and in Extractors? Becasue Hades was like a sci-fi film, Extractors wasn't, but it is still forgetable.What is going on with Sly these days? This was unnecessary made, Stallone did not need to make 2 badly awful sequels! Did he do it for the money? Or did he thought it will bring his career back on the top. I hope they don't make another Escape Plan movie sequel, because I want waste my time watching it! I hope people don't buy DVD or Blu-ray disc and spend $10 + shipment together for this god awful crazy movie.Escape Plan 3: The Extractors I am glad that people like such a badly boring, slow snor fest of a movie! It is a garbage waste of money, waste of talent everyone, each one of the cast. This is a mess of a movie. Stallone does not act like he does in Rocky, Rambo, Cliffhanger, Demolition Man or Over the Top he is wasted in here! So Breslin's enemy kills his gf Abigail played by different actress now from the first film. Sly try's to cry than he turns in to a vigilante and goes after the guy who killed his gf. Why did Stallone had to do that? Just why? Jamie King is awful, she was awful in this movie. 50 Cent he is the same old. Dave Bautista is on this movie he never left both of the movies.This is my horrendeous RANT on Escape Plan 3 if u want to watch a good prison movie about prison escape watch Fortress (1992) with Cristopher Lambert much better movie, better actor than Stallone! The first Escape Plan is a good movie and people put it down and hate it, but like Hades and this one? I don't get it. Escape from Alcatraz (1979) with Clint Eastwood is much better movie than Escape Plan 3: The Extractors! If you ask me both Escape Plan sequels movies are god horrible snory fest GARBAGE!",

            "content": "Escape Plan series is one of my favourites. Every film is so surprisingly great and I totally love them. No matter how much people hate them, I really love every single film including the second one which most people are saying it's bad. This third film is also a great one. Everything's great and so, it becomes one of my favourites.Although this film is a great one, there are two things I don't like. One is Abby could have tell the truth to Les. But she didn't. What I don't get is why. Why didn't she tell him the truth? And her death is really not that good. I know that it was necessary to give Braslin some pressure. But it still makes so sad.The other is that the casting director is not that good. What I mean is that the other actors and actresses are in the right places except for the Daya character. She was supposed to be fluent in Chinese language. But when the actress talked in Chinese, her speaking is the worst I've ever seen. I couldn't even catch it properly. I had to read the English subtitle to get what she's said. I totally understand the other Chinese actors and actresses said, except her. Furthermore, her acting is the worst I've seen in the whole movie. So, if the casting director chose the other actress instead of her, it'd be better than this.I still can't believe that I would see Tong Xin from one of my favorite \"Shui Yue Dong Tian\" TV series again in this film. I can't believe he would grew up like this. But it's really good to see him like that. I feel like his character is so sexy. \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude01One more thing I'd like to mention is that they made Les didn't know how to fight. I mean he should've known a little. I was really expecting to see more actions between him and Braslin. But there wasn't any. So, I'd say I was a bit disappointed.All in all, I feel like \"Escape Plan : The Extractors\" is a bit inferior to the first film but it's still doing good and totally spending time. I don't know about the other people, as for me, it was a great film and I completely enjoyed it.",

The beginning of the movie is an absolute mess - I kept hoping everything would come together, but it was just a bad script. It was as if nobody cared about what they were doing, from writers to actors to editors, nobody was interested in making a great movie. What was that BS about buying a building in Ohio? And why did they return to Ohio from Lithuania or wherever that prison was? And Why did they put the bad guy's father in a cargo box?Why go through the hypocrisy of faking a plot here? On the same flight, I watched John Wick 3. Also an action movie that doesn't go into developing a deep plot, but at least they were self aware about it and made the bare essential plot line (kill assassins before they kill you) make sense. In this, they couldn't make a coherent story out of \"save girlfriends from kidnappers.\"Pure trash.",

Out of the two, I'd say the latter has more.Based on what I had read, this has been totally saved in post production after the test screening. I liked it considerably more than the second movie. The acting is better, the directing is better and I even liked the score better, I'd say it is better on every level.I will say this though, it doesn't start well, but it gets better, there are a few twists and it ends well.All in all, it's better than the second, but not as enjoyable as the first.",

And that's so.\nA mighty chinese business tycoon's daughter was taken and has to be extracted - that's the job. Some personal angles were brought into play. But mainly this movie was showcasing action.\nThe chinese players brought the kung fu display. Quite good. And the American stars were doing the bone cracking wwf style things. Some shooting.\nThe main part is shot in a prison in Latvia.\nIt can be considered as a polished high end version of the better quality Steven Seagal style video movies. Sometimes they are pleasant enough.\nSly wasn't required to do much physical action except at the end. 50 cents showed up in a blink and miss scene. The main villain was built up a lot from the screen play but the climax seemed underwhelming. No stylish brainy hi-tech plans or grandiose screen bursting moves. But some hand to hand comabats were nice.",

            "content": "When the first one made 25 million in the US, but a further $75 million in China, it makes sense that it got Chinese backing for sequels and the producers took the money and ran. Whilst the second one used Stallone and Batista for a poster and credit only to suck you in, it was a vehicle for Asian market with Asian stars. With a more competent direct on John Herzfeld on the third, there's a noted improvement. First Stallone gets about 40 minutes of screen time, whilst he barely got 10 minutes in the second one, there's still great fights for Max Zhang to shine, but Stallone gets more to do here, 50 cent is in it for 2 minutes (always a bonus) and Bautista is the Terry Crews of Expendables, big guy with the big gun, gets a few minutes to shine. HIghights include the career resurgence of Martial Arts Action Star Daniel Bernhardt gets a great end fight with Max Zhang and Stallone gets brutal with Devon Sawa 90s heartthrob from the Final Destination movies. Overall, a vast improvement on number 2, nowhere near as good as the original, but we get fights, we get blood and we get Stallone kicking but here and there. It's easy to see why he's established Balboa Pictures in his twilight years and doesnt want to get caught doing these sequels and Backtrace style films for a quick payday. He cares more about his career than a Cage or Travolta or Bruce Willis at this point and doesnt want to do this for the pay cheque. Overall, starts bad and gets better and ends well.

The odds ramp up when Breslin's girlfriend and colleague Abby (King) is also taken hostage.\n\"I'm done with prisons,\" drawls Sylvester Stallone's security expert Ray Breslin and watching Escape Plan 3 it's hard to disagree. Third time round for Stallone's 4th string franchise (Rocky, Rambo, The Expendables are all higher up the cinematic food chain) the emphasis here is less on the problem solving of previous outings and more a dull cycle through grim punch-ups, bad acting and blatant attempts to woo the Chinese market - The Grandmaster's Jin Zhang and Crazy Rich Asians' Harry Shum Jr have prominent if, like everyone else, underwritten roles in the melee.\nRather than a prison break, this time round it's a break in. The reheated old guff that passes for a plot sees Breslin and his cohorts (Bautista, Curtis '50 Cent' Jackson, Jaime King) looking to extract Daya (Malese Jow), the daughter of a Hong Kong tech giant (Russell Wong) from a giant Latvian penitentiary ominously known as Devil's Landing. Daya and Breslin's partner Abby (Jaime King) are being held hostage by a goon (Devon Sawa) with a grudge against Breslin that stretches back to events in the first film (don't worry we didn't remember either). Previous Escape Plans had a sci-fi tinge. This one is rooted firmly in bargain bin action licks circa 1992 and has little invention or charm to up the ante. It also plays that DTV trick of promising big name stars on the poster and failing to deliver - Dave Bautista appears fitfully and Stallone only a little more.\nDirector John Herzfeld has a background in non fiction and the film bizarrely opens with a tone poem about modern America, almost a documentary on the Trumpian rust belt heartland. After that it's the expected slog through dull exposition, decent if repetitive martial arts fights (in aircraft hangers, office blocks plus a good bit with a crowbar), women-in-peril tropes, endless creeping through dimly-lit sewers, bad speechifying and in Breslin, the most uncharismatic character in Stallone's back catalogue.

The first was decent and entertaining. The direction, writing, acting, and storyline are just flat out boring and terrible.The plot does refer back to the first movie with the connection with the first bad guy. The theme of sins of our fathers idea. Ray (Sylvester Stallone) and Trent (Dave Bautista) and Shen (Jin Zhang Jr.) team up together to go save Abigail (Jaime King) and Daya (Melise) who is involved in an expensive business. When the two girls are kidnapped by Lester (Devon Sawa) and placed in a torn down high security prison.The plot is boring. It has a couple of sub plots about a chinese billionaire company. Two Chinese guys are tasked at rescuing the girl. They both know Ray Breslin. It does wrap up the trilogy well. But poorly executed.The writing is terrible. The direction is horrible. With a boring story. The action sequences are also dull. The fight scenes are nothing new. I am wondering if it was something wrong with the DVD or if the director did manage to forget to put subtitles for when the characters were speaking Chinese for \u00bc of the movie. It was difficult to make out what was going on with the sub plot. This is also one of Stallone's second worse films besides the second film. The rest of the cast was dull with their roles. The villain is forgettable played by Devon Sawa.Overall, Escape Plan: The Extractors is a terrible film. The action is bad. The story is boring. The writing is cheesy. The direction is worse. The film feels like they were about to include a twist with the sub plot of the story but managed to forget about that too. It was terrible overall.",

This Trilogy of movies without a doubt result to be three suspenseful and intriguing films to be liked for action fans , being the first a pretty good movie , turning out to be one of the most original Prison sub-genre movies of the last years ; however the second is a lousy sequel , while the third turns out to be a mediocre follow-up .",

A welcomed alternative to many of today's over choreographed fight scene ballets IMO.I'd love to see these 2 team up again for a sequel and or another project. \ud83c\udfa5I completely enjoyed this movie and remain a fan of both the Director and Stallone \ud83c\udf1f \ud83c\udf1f \ud83c\udf1f \ud83c\udf1f \ud83c\udf1f\nPS\nThe rest of the ensemble also brings their A GAME.

Yet here we are.Thanks to foreign markets - while the film went straight to video in the US, it played in theaters in Russia, Italy, United Kingdom, Australia, Turkey and Portugal - this movie was announced even as Stallone was filing Escape Plan 2.Security expert Ray Breslin (Stallone) is hired to rescue the kidnapped daughter of a Hong Kong tech mogul - who is trying to revitalize small towns in Ohio like Mansfield - and his girlfriend Abigail Ross (Jaime King) from a prison run by the son of Lester Clark Jr. (Devon Sawa, Idle Hands), whose father was the bad guy wat back in the first film.Curtis \"50 Cent\" Jackson and Dave Bautista return for one more mission, one where everything seems shot under a gold filter. There's really nothing that I liked about this film other than Bautista and Stallone's interactions.Director John Herzfeld started his directing career with ABC Afterschool Specials before directing the critically savaged Olivia Newton-John and John Travolta film Two Of A Kind. He also directed The Ryan White Story, The Preppie Murder, Casualties of Love: The Long Island Lolita Story (seriously, the fact that I haven't covered every single Amy Fisher film that I've watched on this site is such a missed opportunity), the Tarantino-influenced 2 Days In the Valley, Don King: Only In America and Reach Me, which also starred Stallone.In fact, he and Stallone go way back to 1976's Cannonball, a movie that Herzfeld acted in. He also appears in Cobra as one of the criminals Stallone sets on fire near the end of the movie and directed Inferno: The Making of The Expendables.Here's all you need to know about the film, thanks to IMDB: The opening production looks last for 90 seconds and the end credits are almost nine minutes, so 11% of the film is just production info.",

I mean done correctly it could have been fine to do a sequel or two but this was thrown together and tossed out straight to DVD like a fan made film only with less passion. The second film was atrocious and this one is not as bad but still as completely forgettable and horribly executed. There is literally no sensical reason for this to exist but even less reason that Sly Stallone and Dave Bautista would do these films? Both have much bigger careers than this and in this film they seem so bored and completely useless that it begs me to wonder why this exists. No one is a bigger Sylvester Stallone fan than I am, no one. (I bought this film blindly on Blu-Ray because it's necessary to own it for me) . The first Escape Plan is such an incredible movie and then this junk drags it's name through the mud. Where this one wins over the previous one is that they actually tie it a little bit into the first, there is some very decent martial arts scenes from some very talented martial artists and the villain was actually not bad played by Devon Sawa. Outside of that there is very little worth seeing here. Stallone's role is fairly limited as is Bautista's except for a few main fights and Curtis Jackson has about 40 seconds of screen time. This is a huge miss and I hope we can finally bury these sequels where they belong and focus on how good the first film was. 5/10",

I actually didn't know there was a series of these pictures, and though this is a lower rated sequel than the original \"Escape Plan\", I'm not really inclined to catch the prior ones based on this installment. Probably the coolest thing about the story is that it takes place in a location called 'Devil's Station', with security expert Ray Breslin (Stallone) leading a team of adversarial Japanese martial artists (Jin Zhang, Harry Shum Jr.) in an attempt to free a number of hostages taken prisoner by the son of a former rogue employee.. The resolution seems almost anticlimactic in the way Breslin dispatches the main villain (Devon Sawa), though it's not enough and quite too late to save his girlfriend Abigail (Jaime King).

            "content": "Never understand why they rushed the franchise too quickly, i mean 2nd Escape Plan 2 Hades just came out last year it flopped very hard got a lot of crap from movie reviews and Critics that hit the crap of it, look Escape Plan 3 was in production while Escape Plan 2 was releasing. i think they should of rushed the franchise too fast i mean to me this movie is like they rushed it too much with film not running hours i mean if they toke Escape Plan 3 more time they would have added more ideas and more action and much more fun and exacting then this would been a lot better, this should come out like 2020 notslaright away slaright forward, it's not just film rushed they rushed entire film story, the writers and director just keep rushing and rushing if they toke it slowly they would have more better ideas for the film. the film what is their to say about ? this is more of rescue mission i rather call this Rescue plan. the prison isn't much at all nothing, this film could have a lot and more and more ideas to add in, give baustia more to do and Stallone does have a lot to do but he needs little bit more given to do, escape plan 2 and 3 are in china sales marketing not in US marketing sadly first Escape Plan made 25 million in the US, but but a further $75 million in China, it makes sense that it got Chinese backing for sequels and the producers took the money and ran it was a vehicle for Asian market with Asian stars i wish that was never been in involved at allwhat i like about this movie baustia is been giving more to do he is in screen a lot more then second film, Stallone always their he is always in action but he needs to be given more to do. the action is good a bit of shaky camera witch annoy's me but it doesn't make me to hate film. the prison looked a bit more dark and rioting hell looked like they could off put more ideas for prison looked like make it more like hell, film doesn't show prisoners that much i mean the place looked like hell a lot so i was thinking from trailer of my thoughts and guess prisoners would have been psycho's crazy people extremely like brawl cell 99 type of look of film, that's what i was expecting but that doesn't happen in film, the plot avoids escape plan 2 hades but this is a lot connected with first escape plan (2013) witch that should been like second is\nstory starts off a kidnapped daughter Daya Zhang (Malese Jow) you have new Asian guy witch he wasn't that bad actor good martial arts but not bad as actor not like guy from second film, Shen Lo (Max Zhang) the grandmaster, IP Man 3, Pacific Rim: Uprising well his girlfriend got kidnapped he goes up to Ray Breslin place but stupidest thing ever he beats up all people from place i am like ? so his a bad guy he beat up a innocent people up could killed them then Ray Breslin (Sylvester Stallone) lead him up and was hired by Hong Kong tech mogul from a formidable, Hush (50 cent) wasn't much in movie i surprised really i am only in 2 scenes that's it sadly, after that for a rescue plan to get Shen girlfriend Daya then somehow Abigail Ross (Jaime King) a love interest to breslin gets kidnapped i am like great ? so this is a rescue plan i swear if i was writer to this i rather call this title not escape plan because this time Ray Breslin doesn't go prison or he doesn't get kidnapped or turns himself in, they go to this location of prison what plan ? what escape plan???? what was plan no one escaped not even 2 girls who were kidnapped that's it they didn't escape at all i mean if you are going to make escape plan movie how about this plan in my plan Ray girlfriend Abigail got kidnapped then villain forces him to turn himself in or else his he will kill his girlfriend ? then he turns himself in how about that story ? then he makes a plan then gets his girlfriend out then they can kick ass ? seethat makes more sense to it then directors or writers of film rushed it too much. the villain is good better villain then another 2 bad guys from 1 two escape plan movies those villains were lame as hell but this Lester Clark Jr. (Devon sawa) known for Final Destination witch i don't want to explain who he is unless you watch the film and find out because that's spoilers, now the entire movie is just not much i mean their is action a lot of it but not a lot as escape plan 2 or 1 the action Stallone kicks ass in film but not as much of crazy action like in first film he does, i liked another villain (Daniel Bernhardt ) known for john wick, matrix, bloodsport 2 and 3, kill em all, i think Stallone and Bernhardt should have fight scene together or Dave Bautista but you have Max Zhang fighting with as showdown not much at all sadly could have Daniel Bernhardt more in it have showdown with Stallone or Bautista. the action was fun and full on violent and dark, their are things you don't see coming in film while your watching it. john Herzfeld director who made 15 minutes, and another Stallone film reach me and he helped project in expendables that's why Stallone hired him on the third, there's a noted some improvement in film but not all of it because their is needed more improvement a lot of it, it needs better action, need to give Stallone much more of action to do because to me it's not enough, give Bautista as well more screening time and more to do in action, make prison look like more of hell and brutal and very scary like van damme movie in hell. Stallone gets more to do here in film, the camera and cinematography is not best, this 3rd film is good, a lot of fun action, Stallone did great but not best in film, baustia got more screening time but he needs much more often, their should been much more of ideas and crazy things for a prison movie should made it like first escape plan style that has everything but sadly who has this franchise has gone down to china sales market to direct to DVD sadly and thanks to Steven c miller ruined sequel then John Herzfeld toke over it look i see what idea he has but it wasn't enough he rushed the movie to fast the running time is 1h 37min. Stallone needs to stop doing direct to DVD films he cares more about his career not like Nicholas cage or john Travolta or Bruce Willis at this point and doesn't want to do this for the pay cheque. i want to see Stallone landing in a proper career with million dollar movies i didn't want to see the ended up like this as in china marketing all that nothing wrong with that i expected this to be a fully American dollar film marketing, it's how escape plan 2 flopped and it didn't get a success like first film. i liked title escape plan devils station but it changed into extractors because they are in arescue mission not a escape plan, because Stallone never got taken to prison at all it's more of rescue mission that's all it is if give it a look the film wasn't bad i watched i enjoy it nothing wrong watching this film this was fun, and a lot of action, story never saw coming at all, Stallone kicking ass in great age. 7.10 not best and much better, but it's better because it's fast forward movie, new actors were better, better villains, it's just good time waster film for fun give it a look it's pretty good if you hated second film or your curious if this is was good, it's good and better then second film i am not saying it's bad movie i am saying it's good but it didn't need to rush it because director John Herzfeld could have better ideas, but what they did to movie wasn't that bad at all give it a look i am huge die hard fan of Stallone and Bautista together.",

Also worthy of note is that the movie begins with animated logos for the six production companies that take up a minute at the beginning. I am also reliably informed (by the IMDb \"crazy credits\" section for this movie) that the end credits last 8 minutes and 45 seconds. For a 97-minute movie, it's a harbinger of a future in which a feature-length movie will be sequels, with opening credits, closing credits, and the lead performers reciting a few catchphrases from their earlier movies, as Stallone does here.",

            "review_title": "Better Than the Rating, But Still Deserving of its Criticism",
            "content": "This movie didn't have a lot going for it. It was the third film in a failing franchise, it was released direct-to-video, which is always a blow to a movie's popularity and appeal, and it was competing with many other frankly better action films of the year, such as \"Cold Pursuit\", \"Fast & Furious Presents: Hobbs and Shaw\", \"Shaft\", \"Angel Has Fallen\", and another Stallone vehicle, \"Rambo: Last Blood\". I recently watched it, and it wasn't bad, but it could've been better, and I really hope this is the last film in the franchise.The plot follows Ray Breslin (Sylvester Stallone) and his team as they attempt to break into an infamous prison, where a team of mercenaries holds the daughter of a wealthy businessman captive. They're hired by the girl's father to do the job, but things become personal when Abigail Ross, Breslin's girlfriend, is also kidnapped by the villains.The first film was great. It was an entertaining, thrilling, excellent action movie that was notable for pairing Sylvester Stallone and Arnold Schwarzenegger, two action legends, and it did that quite well. The second film was very different. It was released director to video, and Arnold was replaced by Dave Bautista (who I personally really like), and it had nothing to do with the first film. It was critically panned, and audiences hated it too. It was marketed as a vehicle for Stallone and Bautista, though it ended up focusing on heavily on Huang Xiaoming, an actor relatively unknown to American audiences, and Bautista appeared in 2-3 scenes total, and did next to nothing. Even Stallone's role was downplayed. All this, along with a noticeably lower budget, greatly brought the film down, and many were hoping the third installment would be an improvement. I thought it was, though only marginally.Miles Chapman writes the story along with John Herzfeld, who also directed the film. Miles wrote all three films, though neither this third film or the second were as good as the first in terms of story and pacing, as well as characters and their development. He's by no means a bad writer, he just had the misfortune of crafting such a good story the first time around that in trying to top himself, he didn't deliver as much. The pacing and flow of the plot is fine, and it was definitely an easier story to follow than the previous film's story.John Herzefeld is directing, as I said, and he hasn't done many other movies, though he has some experience in directing an action film, having done \"15 Minutes\" with Robert DeNiro in 2001. He isn't a bad director, and he crafts some fine action sequences, and paces and shoots the film quite well. I wouldn't mind seeing him do some more bigger-budgeted, more high-brow movies.The actors' performances were all fine, with Sylvester Stallone continuing to be interesting onscreen. He really is a good, underrated actor, and people sometimes forget that he can act as well as he can shoot and fight. This movie gives him some moments where he can actually act, and he does quite well. It would be nice to see him in some more action movies that allow him to flex his muscles as a serious actor. Dave Bautista also works, and he is a terrific action star who I think never really gets his due. He doesn't get a lot of moments to really act, though he does fine for what he had to work with. He does look good in action sequences though, as he proved in \"Spectre\", \"Heist\", \"Bushwhick\", \"Final Score\", and \"Stuber\". He's a great leading man and I hope to see him in more solo action films, though it was definitely nice to see him do WAY more in this film than he did in the last one. Max Zhang and Devon Sawa were also nice surprises, and they both spelled their roles more than I thought. Sawa in particular really surprised me, creating a more imposing and human villain than I was expecting, and he was definitely less overacted and underdeveloped than the last film's villain.The action in this film is the high point, as it's very entertaining and in large quantities. There were a lot of great sequences, especially some excellently choreographed martial arts fights that really showcase the actors' skills, particularly Max Zhang, who it seems went mostly unsung in many reviews. There were some other pretty brutal fight scenes, and it seems like each main actor got one good fight scene. Bautista got a good fight scene and a cool scene in which he mows down several men in a hallway with a large gun (reminiscent of Terry Crews in \"The Expendables\"), and there was a particularly visceral and brutal final fight between Stallone and Sawa. This fight was an excellent scene and probably one of the most vicious beatings I've seen put to screen.In fact, most of the action in this film is bloody and sadistic, much more so than the first two films. Two scenes in particular come to mind: Stallone stabbing a man in the stomach with a knife many times, and him jabbing a metal rod through a man's neck. Both scenes were intense and gory, and a little disturbing actually. Later, Stallone holds a man and slits his throat with a knife while telling him to \"shhh\" before kicking him over a balcony. From what I hear, this gleeful, unflinching violence is even more magnified in Stallone's other action vehicle this year, \"Rambo: Last Blood\". So if graphic and gory violence that's only intended to be shocking, mildly disturbing, and maybe stomach-churning isn't your thing, look elsewhere.This movie's plot was more simple than the last one, and it decided to juggle far fewer characters than the last film, which was way less confusing, making it more enjoyable. It was also connected to the first film, unlike \"Escape Plan 2: Hades\", which already made it more interesting. Once into the plot it became pretty standard stuff, but it worked for me.MAJOR SPOILERS AHEAD:My main, and really only, problem with this film, was the graphic, brutal, pointless killings of several main characters in the film. One of Stallone's crew is gunned down after being taken hostage, and the most egregious death, the senseless killing of Abigail Ross (Jaime King), Breslin's girlfriend. She had been captured earlier in the film by the villain as a way of getting back at Breslin after he arranged the killing of the main villain's father in the first film. The kidnapping of Abigail was fine, as it added a personal element to the story that made it more engaging, since we like Breslin and his friends, but then she is suddenly murdered by her captors midway through the film for seemingly no reason other than shock value. I get that it was probably a realistic plot choice, as Sawa's character really wants to make Breslin feel what he felt when his father was killed, but it took away the personal element and stakes of the film. I didn't much care about the billionaire's daughter or her friend who was also kidnapped, and having Breslin's love also be taken suddenly made me feel more invested. To add to this, her death is needlessly brutal, with her throat being clearly slit onscreen and blood visibly flowing from the wound. The only pluses for this plot point were Stallone being able to throw himself into the role by showcasing his anger (an emotion he does well), and the brutal beating he gives Sawa in the end.So that was an issue for me, as up until that point in the film, it was just a regular, mindless action movie, which I wanted going in. Suddenly after the aforementioned murder scenes, it became way darker and more personal than I was expecting, and it almost reached the level of dark glorification of a vigilante movie. Especially in the end, the final fight and death of the villain was very dark and depraved, as it was entertaining, and the killing of the villain was almost torturous, and way darker a moment than I was expecting from this film.END OF SPOILERSAnother issue, really more of a marketing problem, is 50 Cent's lack of involvement. Much like the last film heavily marketed Bautista and then did nothing with him, this film does the same with 50 Cent, only even worse. 50 Cent only appears in 2-3 scenes total, and has about 5 minutes of screen time. I'd wanted to see him do way more, since he's been a pretty solid actor over the course of the series, and his character is one of the most interesting since he and Stallone are really the only two actors to appear in all three films. So don't go in expecting 50 Cent to play a large part.All in all, \"Escape Plan: The Extractors\" is an ok third outing, that doesn't deserve the 4.4/10 rating. I think anywhere from 5.6-6/10 would be more accurate. It was a rote and routine action movie, though the action sequences were entertaining and flashy, and for an action movie, you could do a lot worse. You could however, do a lot better.",

Now on to the movie review!First the score of music is fantastic and on point unlike the last 2 they were ok but finally Stallone found the right combination, Some critics say the director was ok but some of you do not know this but Stallon does it all and puts most of his money into these movies. The characters get better and better and to tell you the truth Sylvester Stallone is a Network Engineer to say the least he always is able to get really good actors to act into his movies. The camera director was on point! Great drone coverage and very good movement, I was able to see the details even when it was supposed to be a blurr, I hate blurr movies that all you see his a bunch of struggling and that's when you lose me. 50 Cent had a small role this time where he was filmed separate from the rest of the crew, Chances are 50 cent has been busy with other projects and had less time for this film but that's ok because the real star Sidekick of this movie was JIN ZHANG 45 years old and has the moves of a 20 year old reminds me of Jackie Chan and Jet Li when they were in their prime. Dave Bautista is back like always and finds time to film in between Marvel and Guardian of the Galaxies which comes out in 2020. We lost Jaime KIng that played Abigail Ross in this movie which tells me that this is the last of the franchise, it is unfortunate because I love this franchise and it can keep going like Fast and the furious unfortunately it does not have a huge following that Fast and the Furious has and thus the end of a good idea. Devon Sawa seemed to be a good bad guy in this movie but he didn't really give me the serious bad guy vibe that is seeking revenge at every corner. I would of gone with a big finally where Stallone could of lost his house, Blown up, His plane, his building and everything that made the company what it is today because of his father helping him build it. Then finally the end would be the same and of course Sylvester Stallone becomes RAMBO all over again lol... South America... if you didn't get that joke then you need to keep up with the Rambo franchise because they are all connected in some way.",

This was an embarrassment and waste of time that I'll never get back. I thought it would have been a direct continuation of the 2nd movie, but had nothing to do with it whatsoever.

The backstory was left a bit mystery...but how complicated can an action flick be?Ok, well...this was not a very fun movie. It starts quite slow, like some agent/detective thriller. Most of the movie is the villain doing villainous things and the heroes planning to go to rescue. The overall tone is somehow cold, and most of the movie seemed depressing to me. I mean, the last two installments in Rambo series were also violent and pessimistic but managed also to be entertaining action flicks. But this one pretty much not. I believe there may be fans to this kind of gritty violent thrillers that abstain the cheesiness of \"fun\" action films. But probably this one isn't particularly great even in that department. Me personally started to wish I was watching some 80s action movie instead.Alonside Stallone we have many side characters. Dave Bautista plays Stallones ally, a big dude with a giant shotgun on his shoulder. When he started diving to action I thought he's cooler than Stallone - finally the movie is getting good! Too bad he was there only briefly. Then there's martial arts guy Jin Zhang who does some great fighting and almost steals the show as the main hero.I have one more complaint. The camerawork was often too shaky. Freehand cam is ok if it's used wisely (or if you're an amateur just doing movies for fun) but this was one of those movies where it seems like the camera must be shaking all the time, even in slow scenes when people are just talking. I don't get what's the appeal in that.Overall not a terrible movie but...not good either. The only reasons to watch: the novelty of it being Stallone, Bautista shooting shotgun in a short scene, and the several martial arts scenes.",

To be fair though I suppose, the imagery shown during the credits, which is not a post-credit scene however, sheds some light, though confusing, on his current status, while hinting a possible sequel, which hopefully will never happen, and should never happen.Even with its horrid CGI, Escape Plan: The Extractors is better than Hades, which admittedly was a welcomed surprise, with a better story and better action, but it is still tremendously inferior to the original.4.3/10.",

Why did they bother making a third after such a poorly-received second instalment?Anyway, in The Extractors (aka Escape Plan III) Sylvester Stallone's crew are breaking into a prison this time - an old, desolate one in Eastern Europe, where the bad guy is making things personal - rather than getting someone out. Lots of bloody violence and Stallone ends the movie as he ends most of them: looking like he's been through the ringer but still walking tall and resolute, dang it.Would have been best to stop after the excellent first Escape Plan. That was fun. The sequels? Not so much.",

Stallone's performance was for me the highlight, brutal and honest.Then added to the mix is Dave Bautista, who has a few brief but enjoyable moments to shine, and on top of that is some sublime martial arts moments, non more so that Jin Zhang and Daniel Bernhardt's almost dance like fight.50 Cent was also there very briefly, near the beginning.Over all its a distilled shot of action that burns bright and fades fast. I just wished there was a little more of it, especially after being force fed the long drawn out bland gruel that was the second film.On a final note, ignore the bad reviews, and give it a go, you might be surprised, I was.",

Then the bring his son in to cast revenge but the plan is weak asf, they had 2 of the chinese guys, who were breaking the kidnapped woman, in their captive but yet didn't kill them? They don't know who they are what so ever, so why not kill them?The film is just filled with errors for example the henchmen shoot one of their captive and show his blood on the floor, then they drag him and there's no trail? Sloppy! Stallone literally uses a flash light all the time in the tunnels, if I can see, you can see mate! In the tunnels or just after, Stallone sets up his flash light to be on strobe and has a guy walk through the door and investigate it, the other henchman then closes the door behind him and starts to get into a better position till Stallone goes through a different doorway next to the very same door and jams a pole through his head, what is the point of the first door? It's next to a doorway which leads to the same place and which no one saw before!In the \"big\" final fight scene, Stallone gets shot and it looks like it's hit his eye as there's a lot of blood there, next scene when Stallone goes into hand to hand combat, no blood on his eye? If you're going to make a film then don't piss off the audience with cheap film making, be consistent with what's just happened at least! Also Stallone is like 70 I swear, how is no one kicking his arse?At the very end there's a scene where the bodyguard jumps out of a pipe into the tunnel and then falls to the ground, what on earth does that add to the film?! Nothing at all! Please don't say it's to set up another film and somehow he is the new protagonist!! I started to watch the credit scenes at the end and there is just huge text behind whoever is on the screen for instance with the director, the text just reads director? Seems like more attention was put on the end credits than the actual film!Also how many producers do you need? I think I saw 10 at least?

Why would he also kidnap Stallone character's girlfriend at the same time as revenge as well, when that would just cause Stallone's character to come out to Latvia to look for her and possibly ruin the original plan of ruining the Chinese business tycoon.The good guys had to break into the hellish prison, but there was no break in involved. Two ran through the front lawn that had explosives and got caught right away. The other just walked in through the sewers which they just happened to have a blueprint for on their computer (remote old prison in Latvia which likely wouldn't have digitized prison sewer blueprints).During few scenes when the main bad guy in the prison yelled \"lock them up,\" the locking clunk sounded like a modern automatic locking system for all cell block doors at once. But yet the cell doors were individual type that they still had to use keys for.In one scene Bautista's character is shown walking inside the prison, but it's unclear how he got there, bypassing security and cameras.In another scene one of the Asian heroes used a taser to start a fire from chipped stone in his prison cell. In a fight scene between the Asian hero and a bad guy, I thought the bad guy was the main bad guy, but it wasn't. They just looked alike.Shows you how easy it is to not pay attention, and lose track to what's happening due to a poor story line. It's a big boring mess. Watch it for the cheesiness but don't get too exited.",

Like the most basic revenge story you can come up with, and than have it told by a little kid.\nMain setting is supposedly \"a hell of the worst kind\" and \"a maze\". But it turns out to be just a poorly maintained prison that's everything short of a maze; people just walk in and out and have no problem or whatsoever to find each other. Showing only four or five rooms and a corridor doesn't give you a maze-feeling either.\nLots of those little things that shows nobody cared. How does it make sense that only once you're in the \"maze\", you think it might be a good idea to load your shotgun? Good for you that nobody saw you coming. You know, being in a heavily guarded maze and such...Acting is very lazy, except for Stallone maybe. He tries to hard, like he's trying to save more than his girlfriend. A movie, for instance.\nScenes with Bautista are specially hard to watch. Looks like he has to do this because of contractual obligations, certainly not because he wants to.A disappointment.",

I have to say the action scenes are pretty good. I did enjoy the intensity and choreography of it.What super annoys me about the movie is the actors hired that are supposed to be Chinese from China. I know most of the moviegoers will never pick it up, unless they study Chinese a bit in high school or college, or they are actually fluent Chinese speakers. But the fact that you have actors that are playing the part of Chinese investors from China, and the Chinese employees that works for that corporations, and they can't even speak Chinese well enough to pass for native speakers? That is just lazy casting. I can understand if these actors can't speak English well, because that it literally their second or third language, it would actually be believable. But the actress that played Daya Zhang (Malese Jow) spoke fluent English, but I have to try really hard to translate her horrible Chinese pronunciation (the movie would be way better off using voice over on her Mandarin Chinese lines). Considering there are literally a billion Chinese people on this planet, plenty of them are fluent in both English and Chinese.\nObviously if the action movie star hired can't speak their Chinese lines fluently I can at least understand. Use voice actors for the few Chinese lines they have to say in the movie, and the movie will be even more awesome and authentic. Just saying, listening to horrible foreign language by supposedly native speakers is like hearing nails on the chalkboard.",
