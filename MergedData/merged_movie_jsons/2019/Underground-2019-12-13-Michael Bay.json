I think platforms like Netflix and so on is just a place for people like Micheal Bay so they can go do their thing so freely. There is so many to talk about actually. The great crazy action opening sequence right away, really weird song choices including the internet meme one(RUN) and so on... I liked the way the mood changes and kinda turns into a political fight. Also, the good about it is that it's not a stupid American provocative movie. Not the best time i had but definetely it was different and fun.",

            "content": "This is a typical modern Michael Bay film, it's all style over substance. Leave your brain at the door and you might enjoy it, I wish I did but I didn't.I'll give you a quick example of what to expect while trying to explain why I couldn't bring myself to enjoy this film. Opening scene is a 15 minute car chase through a city. Firstly, the vehicle they choose to use as a getaway vehicle is a bright neon green Alfa Romeo that sticks out in the crowd like a sore thumb driving a bright neon green sports car would. Why would anyone choose this as a getaway vehicle instead of a car with a paint job a bit more inconspicuous I hear you ask? Because it's a Michael Bay film that's why, and it's all about style remember? Secondly, every car and bike that crashes during the chase produces enough sparks and fire to rival the opening ceremony of the Beijing Olympics, plus the sounds they make when they crash are the most ridiculous Transformers sounding noises I have ever heard outside of a Transformers movie. And lastly, the bright neon green sports car gets scratched up by another vehicle and the drivers side mirror gets knocked off, but the next shot it's back on again, then it's off, then it's on, and it switches between broken and not broken a dozen or so times before someone decided that for continuity sake we better just stick to one or the other and thankfully they chose to go with the broken one. Pretty sloppy filmmaking really, and this is all in the opening 15 - 20 minutes, and unfortunately I can't turn my brain off enough to enjoy a film like that.Other things that I didn't like about the film, the overall story is laughable and makes absolutely no sense at all, and when I say no sense I'm not being hyperbolic I mean it makes no sense, from the people he chooses to join his team to the way he recruits them to the missions they do it's all so ludicrous, if you allow yourself to question its logic for even one second then the entire thing falls apart. It's got your typical Michael Bay hit or miss humor along with other \"Bayerisms\" that we've come to expect from him, like the over use of quick cuts during action sequences, low angle shots of women in short skirts, so much slow motion that if the slow motion parts were at normal speed I reckon the film would be about half an hour shorter than it is, and scenes that are meant to be emotional and pull on your heart strings but because every character has no depth to them they end up having about as much emotional impact as a carpet cleaning commercial does.What I did like. CGI people getting hit by cars and caught in explosions and thrown around and stuff, it was completely overused but the first few times it happened it looked quite good, especially people getting side swiped by vehicles. Some of the bad guy kills were well done. I enjoyed most of the banter between Ryan Reynolds and the non Ryan Reynolds actors, it was funny and was just Ryan Reynolds being your typical Ryan Reynolds which is good if you like Ryan Reynolds and I like Ryan Reynolds. Who doesn't like Ryan Reynolds? Hugh Jackman that's who, the Canadian fraud.It really is just a film full of loud noises, bright colors, explosions and little of anything else.",

            "content": "Michael Bay Deluxe, the BOOM, the POW and Ryan Reynolds. It's just about what I was expecting - mindless action, shallow story, (mostly) bland comedy, clich\u00e9 characters & Reynolds doing his usual shtick. The explosions, gunfights and chases are a little less awesome on the streaming screen, but still deliver the manly blockbuster entertainment we came for in the first place.The generic nature of the trailers, all of them, lowered the expectations to levels that ultimately helped enjoy the actual movie more. Naturally, the most valued card in the deck of \"6 Underground\" is the action - it has it all, from gunfights, to explosions, to flying, diving, car chases, parkour and so on. Great stunt work, expensive and well done cgi - no doubt about these things. What helped all that even more was a pretty generous splash of blood and gore. Could've pushed out even more, given the R rating. You can probably guess that it is by no means a realistic action movie, and you're right. That, and also, while the action is consistent, the impact and enjoyment of it is not - therefore pacing stutters, at times. The story is familiar and quite generic, depthless and Hollywood-in-a-nutshell by all standards. Nothing much more to add, the good guys battle and take down the evil guy, the usual. Our team of heroes consist of clich\u00e9 characters, portrayed by decent actors having to do only either stunts or humorous dialogue. Ryan Reynolds portrays a more watered down version of all his latest roles conjoined & the comedy in \"6 Underground\" is hit & miss, mostly just bland and uninspired. I imagine there'll be complaints about the cinematography - it can be head-spinning and some of the cuts are questionable, but as a sum it's more than alright, not the biggest of flaws.It is rather sad that I was expecting so little (I mean, slightly above average) and that it's exactly what I got. I believe that, even with all the bad etched-in-stone reputation, mr. Michael Bay can do better than this, has done better than this. That being said, \"6 Underground\" is by no means a 'bad' movie, it's your typical, loud, shiny action-packed blockbuster, with a good cast and big enough budget for you to get some kicks out of it. My rating: 6/10.",

Everything about this film is a vicious assault on the senses akin to the D-Day invasion of Normandy. I swear that every noise of the universe is in this 'movie'.An expensive advert for Alfa Romeo, 6 Underground is barely a movie; despite a strong opening sequence, the film is completely riddled with all the typical trademarks of a classically trashy Michael Bay picture, complete with gratuitous violence, loud explosions, choppy editing, disastrous dialogue and a threadbare story.Before you say anything, I know exactly what I expect of Bay and his brainless movies. His projects are not hard to enjoy if you leave your brain at the door before watching. However, there was something so off about this, something so deeply vulgar and crass, that I just couldn't enjoy it even when I did switch off.I can only just about bring myself to give 6 Underground a maximum of two stars for the flashy cars and the normally dependable Ryan Reynolds and Melanie Laurent. But it's still a deeply unpleasant experience with all the subtlety of a magnitude 9 earthquake; for that reason and the other reasons above, this film should be buried deep underground for all eternity.",

The film suffers from having myriad annoying characters, all competing to be witty and edgy, led by Ryan Reynolds basically playing Deadpool without the costume. I could do without them. The action is typically overblown and bombastic, chock-full of explosions and mayhem, and I did appreciate the gratuitous violence throughout, although some of the FX are a little off.

(R)Headache-inducing series of flashy, hyperactive action scenes in search of a compelling plot to reasonably tie them together (and a purpose to exist in the first place). Reynolds is a billionaire who decides to disappear off the grid and assemble a squad of fellow ghosts with special talents to take down unimaginatively evil dictator Raz. The team is a collective of snide ciphers, with flashback \"origin stories\" providing no depth or personality--they bicker, gripe, crack wise, shoot, run, drive, look good doing it, and that's about it. Opens with a visually chaotic car chase that has no sense of place, orientation or rhythm, and lasts way too long...yet still emerges as arguably the highlight of the movie (that, or the use of magnets during the climax). Like most Bay flicks, it's full of individual shots that would look great in coffee table books or wall calendars, but when it comes to basic techniques of motion, momentum, escalation and spatial relationship, utterly hopeless (plus, the editing is spastically choppy enough to make a Michelin star chef jealous). If there's a reference to the Sneaker Pimps, it got lost under all the explosions.28/100",

What's so impressive about this film is that after watching 100 fast and furious films and carbon copys \"6 UNDERGROUND\" raises the bar to an entirely higher level. The camera angles combined with a radiant spectrum of colors that flash through each scene not only at times puts you directly in the driver's seat but the excitement of it all is incredibly enjoyable to watch. (Ryan Reynolds) leads this all star cast and plays his usual type of character, The adventurous, funny, slightly frightened but extremely likable guy, only this time he's a billionaire who leads a 5 persons elite secret team on a vendetta to right all the wrongs in the world. Expect to see Michael Bay make many more sequels under this franchise while it builds a cult following. If all the over the top hollywood action films could produce this quality there wouldn't be a lot to complain about.",

Unbelievable what we do see over there. Once the chase is over we move towards an action flick, again, typical Ryan with the stupid jokes and the typical action.Even as it clocked in over 2 hours i found it worth seeing. It got all elements, action, jokes, and even a bit gore here and there. You will love it i'm sure, and even the acting was above mediocre for such kind of flicks.Oh yeah, and the score....loved it.Gore 1/5\nNudity 0/5\nEffects 5/5\nStory 3/5\nComedy 0,5/5",

And that's the whole point of this film. It's for people who truly don't need any sense of logic or a barely coherent plot to enjoy a film . Just plenty of action scenes, car chases, explosions, bad guys, naked hot women etc.. thrown together to form a collection of Micheal Bays wet daydreams. I won't attempt to further analyse or criticise this movie, as that would be without merit. If you're one of the aforementioned people, then you'll probably enjoy it.

Three (Manuel Garcia-Rulfo) is the Hitman. Four (Ben Hardy) is the Skywalker. Five (Adria Arjona) is the Doctor. Six (Dave Franco) is the Driver. During a car chase in Florence, Six is killed. One recruits American sniper Blaine (Corey Hawkins) as Seven.Michael Bay is doing Michael Bay. The story telling is messy and thin. There are problems with the simplistic premise. The action is explosive and hyper kinetic. The idiotic Bay humor is improved by the presence of Ryan Reynolds. It is too bad that Dave Franco dies so early since he is the second funniest actor in the cast. Ryan needs someone better to bounce off his quippy sarcasm. The best aspect is the great Michael Bay action. Even if the magnet idea makes little sense, it is still great action fun. The parkour is thrilling. This is a movie of great big action set pieces in between a lifeless unearned story with paper thin characters.It starts with the chase in Florence. It is wildly exciting and explosive but the plot has the most muddled introduction. For a second, I actually thought that they were literal ghosts. At the very least, One has to be introduced and the mission needs to be laid out. With such a paper thin intro, the action becomes meaningless. It's a bunch of quippy retorts from Ryan and some really cool car stunts in the narrow Italian streets. There's real value in that but it's just empty calories. This is a movie of empty calories. The mission itself is a nothing burger of simplistic politics. Why not have the dictator kill Ryan Reynolds' great love? Instead, it's a non-descript humanity project. As for the final shootout, it seems much more simpler to plant a few mines on the boat to drive the dictator off it. One thing is certain. Michael Bay does his action well. The rest is a nothing burger.",

To be honest the first 10 minutes feel like just too much action, to the point you wonder if there is even a script? But if you just watch it for what it is and if you're a fan of car chases, explosions , shoot outs and just action , then as far as Netflix movies go you might enjoy it.

With this movie, Bay proves sadly that he's not only not slowing down, he is actually getting worse at his craft. The story in this movie makes almost no sense, from it's ultra high speed unfolding to the fact that many plot details seem missing. The characters are cold and not the least bit sympathetic, from their lack of depth to the fact that they inflict their sadism on everybody (including innocent bystanders). And the action sequences make pretty much no sense, from their rapid editing to their poor direction and choreography. In short, this movie is an over two hour long headache. Though sadly it will probably get a lot of looks from curious Netflix users, and Netflix will subsequently look at the ratings and greenlight a sequel. No thanks, Netflix.",

Mercifully, it had humor.And yet, I liked it. Could I watch a sequel? Probably not. My sensory overload and headache need a little recovery.A specialty misfit team of numbered individuals are banded together by a smart-smart aleck billionaire to hunt evil when no government will, or can't, due to red tape. After about 3-4 episodes of the aforementioned fake TV series in the first 15 minutes, the plot kicks in of overturning a ruthless dictator and the team tries to work together with each other's strengths and weaknesses.Despite an annoying and maddening amount of CGI scenes so overlapping in the car chase opening, I was still intrigued enough to continue. Luckily, I didn't know this was Bay directing, or I might not have made it to the finish, but, regardless, I'm glad I did.Number One (Ryan Reynolds) was the plot's glue, grounding and absolute source of laugh-out-loud humor. Ben Hardy's (\"Number Four\") amazing parkour and looks helped me long. And the remaining Numbers, while bland as all Hades, did their parts to round out the team.Again, I'm not up for the inevitable sequel, but if they'll hire a competent director and slow it down a bit, I'd love to see where they take these characters. Otherwise, this was ONE and DONE 4 me.***Final thoughts: WARNING: Forget strobe lights; this entire movie was an epileptic seizure waiting to happen. If you're remotely sensitive or prone, AVOID this movie at all costs. Or watch it and sue Netflix. Cut me in, if you do. I could use even a fraction of the dough Netflix has.",

It has Ryan Reynolds basically being himself and acting as Number 1, a billionaire who upon faking his own death recruits a misfit team in order to topple an evil dictator of a made up country. What follows is a shaky, loud and explosions filled 2 hours in which all the bad guys are killed and scores of bystanders too. Collateral damage seems to be acceptable as long as it is for some good cause which in this case is toppling a dictator and replacing him with his good brother. The good brother is in fact so good that the first thing he does is deliver his evil brother to a refugee camp where the villain is beaten to death by the people he has oppressed.This movie might appeal to 12 year olds who will enjoy looking at the good looking women and mindless adrenaline inducing over the top action but if you actually want something with a plot that makes sense and is grounded even a little bit in reality watch something else.",

            "content": "A group of six agents had leave their past behind, they are dead for mankind to change the world for good. Now they are planning to make a coup d'\u00e9tat that's going to be a wild ride full of explosions, action and jokes.If you're expecting a wonderful movie with deep characters with deep motivations to make something to change the world, then you shouldn't watch this movie. Underground 6 is a film about action; it doesn't pretend to be something that is not. Ryan Reynolds is a clear proof that this movie is simple fun; his character is funny but really strategical. Every actor does a decent job with the role they were assigned.There are three long action scenes that make the movie worthy. One at the beginning, then in the middle and one in the end, these three scenes are really well directed when it comes to this kind of movies.It's not a perfect film because is fun but that's it. There's nothing at risk. I mean, yeah, you could say that if they don't succeed then the world must be an awful place, but it's just a movie. The villain seems to be a cartoon villain with his over the top evilness. The main characters are all based on one personality trait or two.One (Ryan Reynolds) is the American leader. Two (M\u00e9lanie Laurent) is the cold and smart French. Three (Manuel Garcia-Rulfo) is the emotional hitman Latino. Four (Ben Hardy) is the funny parkour man. Five (Adria Arjona) is the Mexican nurse. Six (Dave Franco) the frat boy who dies. Seven (Corey Hawkins) is the black military man who is not going to leave anyone behind. Yes, this is a very diverse cast and group, points for representation but these characters are not so deep like they may seem. I would say that the only and deep character is Three but sometimes it's a little bit a stereotype of the emotional man.My conclusion is that if you want to watch a movie just because you want to see action and explosions and not think too much. Underground 6 is perfect for you.",

A-Team, Expendables, Mission Impossible all rolled into one film (In one scene they were even quoting movie lines). Usually storylines have a build up, this movie starts off in high octane action and the build up happens in the middle, becoming boring in places resulting in clock watching. Some of the action scenes you see in the trailers are flashbacks of persons previous life before they became a Ghost, and not part of the story.Also there were 7 who became 6, who were not underground, but above ground?? Also, the editing is poor. One scene shows a car being hit by a truck and the wing mirror of the car is snapped off, two minutes later it's miraculously back on, intact. That is just one of many bad edits throughout.There is no storyline. They decide to pursue one man \"to make the world a better place\" and it's all action to get to him. There is no understanding on why the car chase at the beginning of the movie is taken place, other than a foiled robbery??The movie did have potential, but it is spoiled by the severe over the top profanity (the first 15 minutes there were more F bombs than a Gordon Ramsay full series), obscene sexual content (both in role playing and conversations) and stomach wrenching gore which if you don't have a good stomach, then avoid.Not something you'd want to watch with your Granny, or parents for that matter.The action encompasses the storyline. I really do not recommend this movie. Had the profanity been toned down by 95% and the unnecessary sex scenes deleted, then maybe, just maybe I'd give it a 5/6.",

Actually, most scenes are some of the best I've ever seen.Reynolds earned every penny paid for this as well as the other cast (Franco definitely included, for his smaller but great part). The other characters were also *perfect* choices and complimented Reynolds well. I loved all the characters equally.The star role is what Netflix seems to miss sometimes, but does hit it out of the park other times -- stop putting newcomers in star roles and leave that to the big boys (Franco and Reynolds both worked hard on their way up). This time they hit a home run.Michael Bay was also a great choice as director. That guy just seems to know good movies, even though years ago I doubted he would keep making high quality stuff. If Netflix can like, buy this guy, they should.There were so many cool things in this movie that it's almost hard to notice that a lot of things are fake and too over the top at times (to the point where it wasn't believable), like the laughing gas part. However, it still made for an awesome movie. Not everything extreme makes a good scene, but these extreme scenes we're good ones (overall, anyway). A lot of parts just made me think \"Oh, wow!\", which is what I mainly watch movies for, but some also made me cringe at times (even though none were to the point of being absurd).The other reason I like this movie is because it kept me wanting to watch it -- never once did I want to stop. I give a 10 to all movies that do this because it's hard to get me to sit through a whole movie. Also, I actually wanted to rewatch it -- something I hardly ever want to do.Netflix: Keep making movies like this, PLEASE. There were 9 bad guys -- what about the other 8? Hint: sequels! Also, maybe study the people who didn't like this because I feel there might be something wrong with them (just joking, but come on -- this movie rocks).Update: Heard this might be a TV show, possibly merging with Money Heist? Please don't. Just make a sequel with M. Bay, and go from there.",

Lots of expensive cars getting blown up, hot actors and actresses close ups with lens flare, high octane action and silly one lines.After Deadpool Ryan Reynolds has made a reputation of himself and he lives Upto that reputation by delivering comic one liners between action. While some of them land, some don't. The rest of characters are passable, that doesn't mean their acting is bad. Everyone has done a good job.The plot was interesting but nothing innovative. Editing was sometimes jarring but most of the time keeps you on edge. There are on your nose obvious song choices during some sequences.The first 20 minutes of the movie is perhaps one of the best car chase action sequence, definitely one of the top tens. The final action is just mindless bonkers and I really want to see it's making.So, grab a drink and lots of chips and watch this movie for solid entertaining, loud, action packed Ryan Reynolds movie that Michael Bay has made.I give this 7/10.\nOriginal score is to even out scores by those who didn't know what they were getting into.",

Yes, spelled incorrectly for pronunciation purposes, but still!All I can say is WOW!Skeptical at first, as I didn't hear much media buzz about 6 Underground; but simply stunning, attention-grabbing and eye opening!I hate to compare these two films, but the first 20 minutes of 6 Underground reminded me of the first 20 minutes of Saving Private Ryan.No, not the actual relevance of real word events, hell, death and tragedy, but the cinematography created by the Master: Mr. Bey.Saving Private Ryan had audiences more than captivated. You could have driven a truck into the theater and not one person would have looked away from the movie screen with that piece of Film Perfection inthe first 20-45 minutes.Again, not trying to associate the two, but I was so enamored by just the first half hour of \"6\", that I actually ate a whole can of Chef Boyer-dee, and didn't even realize it!! I just couldn't look away! (Enter: beef-a-roni stomach ache)Sad that lil Davey Franco had such a short appearance, though I would love to see him as a prequel to the prequel of the prequel (?) if that makes sense... Don't think it would work with the fact he was dumped to \"sleep with the fishes\" here, but maybe if there is a \"7\" or even a \"5 Underground\" for a sequel, I think the Franco would shine!Ryan Reynolds is cinematic gold! Serious and heartwarming as such movies like School of Life, yet \"smart-ass-ey\" like a Deadpool pioneer! I would suggest a bit more combat scenes with Ryan (much like his Blade: Trinity scenes and Deadpool) as he can whoop some ass!Femme Fatales: O M G! Great choices with these vixens!

Since Bay seems to have wrapped up most of his commitments to the Transformers franchise, I suppose he's looking for a new series with this Netflix release, \"6 Underground.\" Basically, this one is the same loud, adrenaline-junkie garbage he usually makes. Another rapidly-edited, stunt-laden car chase sequence occupies the opening act even before, as well as during, the narrative set-up regarding what the gang of heroes are and will be doing. After an especially blatant product-placement shot for Captain Morgan rum (and this after they make a guy a \"pirate\" by removing one of his eyes--get it?), there's some fighting, shooting and killing in a building, then some more of that on a yacht. They incite a coup in a fictional Asian state named \"Turgistan.\" Anyways, I'd better tolerate the shots lasting one or two seconds before cutting to the next if it weren't for the obnoxious pop-music soundtrack, the sex scenes that are filmed the same way except with the addition of ass shots of women, the car commercials, listless parkour, hero posturing, and the gaudy slow-motion tableaus.It's peculiar that during the car chase sequence, this visual mess threatens to spill over into the destruction of historically-important pieces of art, including Michelangelo's \"David,\" or as this movie has it, the statue of the guy with a small penis. Another scene has a brutal dictator admiring the artwork of the Louvre. These scenes aren't as perfect of a metaphor for what Bay does to art as was his destruction of Ancient Egyptian monuments in the second Transformers burger, but it offers a stark contrast nonetheless between art and exploding rubbish such as \"6 Underground.\"The casting of Ryan Reynolds here makes sense. Besides putting a likable personality in front of the rest of the action-movie noise meant to disguise writing so lazy that it borrows its punchlines from other movies and media--and points that out, as if that's the joke--Reynolds has plenty of experience with (super)hero franchises. They even got his \"Deadpool\" writers to script this one. Again, Reynolds provides voiceover narration to directly address the audience, as he becomes something of a resurrected \"ghost\" who, then, assembles a team to fight baddies. Deadpool, Green Lantern, Blade, Deadpool again and, now, this. Given that he's an inventive billionaire in this one who, at one point, is accused of acting like Bruce Wayne, I guess this is Reynolds's Batman picture.

It was a lot more complicated than it needed to be, as I'm still not sure what happened when, in its timeline. The second hour is the most enjoyable as there are no flashbacks, you know what's happening and it flows better, despite the shaky cam.It's a very Michael Bay movie, with action sequence with explosions following action sequence with more explosions. There are some great deaths (including innocent bystanders) and laughed out loud two or three times.Ryan Reynolds is Ryan Reynolds, and since I like him, it worked for me. He brings the same energy he brings to Deadpool or Blade 3 (he saved that movie for me) here and he is fun. M\u00eblanie Laurant and Adria Arjona bring the glamour, but they are not just eye candy, one is a doctor and the other an ex cia agent. The stand out in the cast for me was Ben Hardy (last seen in Bohemian Rhapsody) who plays the parkour member of the team, he was great. Sadly the bad guy is a bit one dimensional, although he is played well.Whilst its script is not the best (it has an lame, surprise twist at the end) and Bay still thinking its 1995 it does have some stunning locations (especially in Italy) an excellent cast, a decent score and is more than watchable.Overall is it a good movie?? not really. But was I entertained?? Hell, yes I was. I'm not sure how much of that was down to the 4 bottles of beer I drank whilst watching it.",

The cinematography by Bojan Bazelli boasts dazzling frames when the (shaky) camera isn't running behind someone during a bloated set-piece. The film also spends a good amount of time trying to explain the motive of its lead characters but you come to an early conclusion that there isn't any. Barring a few funny one-liners by Ryan Reynolds, the writing by Deadpool writers Rhett Reese and Paul Wernick is largely bland.P.S - The opening twenty-minute set-piece was the best of the lot!",

As a parkour expert and urban explorer he has the skills and experience to move through, over, and around buildings in ways that normal people just cannot. So why is it that every bad guy can catch him up so easily? Every time he is in a location that is totally within his element where he is running from a group of bad guys we see him getting distance on them. Cut away and cut back and now they are right on top of him.

There is a vague explanation as #1 meets with some lawyer who refuses to give him information about a brutal dictator in fictional Tujikistan. However, the fallout that succeeds the meeting is given very little to no explanation. I guess he gets killed??? Apparently the guy was a mafioso lawyer as well so he he gets 100's of grunts, countless Alpha Romeros to speed through the narrow Florence streets, and military grade chopper to track and contain his killer, in Italy??? What??? Why would Italy protect a foreign dictator? And why would the dictator's lawyer have so much muscle guarding him??? Makes no sense!!!\n2. If this crew is trying to keep a low profile, then why in the eff do they drive around in a hideous lime green Alpha Romero??? Yeah, not conspicous at all!! Effing ridiculous!\n3. The writing and dialogue appeals to the unmotivated teenage flunkey with zero intelligence or sophistication that will undoubtedly get his fat unattractive high school girlfriend pregnant before graduation and then live a miserable existence unloading boxes from DHL trucks until he's 50 and OD's on meth. If you think any of these characters are admirable or any of the writing has one iota of humor in it, then you are a complete waste of effing space and your worthless family deserves to remain trapped and oppressed in the mobile home you all assuredly live in!

Because said dictator is bad and kills hundreds of innocent people, right? Surely you are morally uptight and want to do the right thing!! Hmmm, and what about the innocent people you ran over and who were needlessly killed on your get away through Florencein that completely gay looking Alpha Romero???

Pedestrians are mown down or shot without a second thought, meaning that it is impossible to relate to, or care about, the lead characters from the very start. As yet another car was destroyed in slow motion, and the chase went literally nowhere, my son turned to me and asked what on earth was going on. How is it possible to make such an action-packed scene so boring?!This is a movie by teenagers for teenagers. Atrocious plot, editing and continuity. Mindless action can, and should be, fun.

            "content": "Overall the film is definitely an enjoyable action film. Not one I would be able to watch more than once but definitely a film I could recommend to action flick fans to at least watch once.The issue with the film is the story and writing is quite mediocre. Don't get me wrong, there are moments where the writing is quite brilliant and I had a small giggle but for the most part the lines fall flat and the dialogue all feels very forced and unnatural. The story itself is also nothing special and is just good enough to give the action context. But the focus point of this film is by far the action.I don't know how much CGI was used in this film as all the action comes across as authentic and feels very real. This is because they used a lot of practical effects to ground the action sequences so any CGI added to these is not distinguishable from what is real and what is fake.My only complaint about the action is that at times the cinematography and editing is all done too fast. Fast cuts, shaky cameras, fast pans, etc... When in actuality it was not needed as the stunts in this film are top class so I would have really enjoyed to have seen more of the stunts on film rather than to lose so much of the visuals to fast cuts/pans/shaky cam.Another complaint about this film is the first 50 minutes really felt very directionless the story kind of jumps around and you have story sequences tossed in the middle of hectic action sequences with some over the top gore added in and it was just an awkward mess but suddenly after the 50 minute mark it almost becomes an entirely different film. The plot is a lot more focused, the action sequences are more focused and the over the top gore is just gone for the rest of the film.In terms of the action sequences, one of the biggest issues with many modern day action flicks is that CGI is overused. There are some sequences in this film they easily could have saved money on and done fully in CGI but they didn't they did it in practical effect and added CGI layers on top and it just adds so much to the quality of these sequences. I can't even watch any new Fast Furious films as they are 100% over the top CGI - not here in this film. Everything while grandiose and visually amazing is all done in practical effects and the payoff is just so worth it.If the film had better story and writing I could easily have rated it higher but alas beyond the epic action sequences and top quality acting the story and writing just falls flat thus the 6/10 I have given it.",

Renaming himself One, he recruits various individuals from around the world, to join his organisation, and live as he does, with numerical numbers to each of their names, applying their various skills in his quest to rid the world of horrible people. Rovach Alimov (Lior Raz) is a brutal dictator in the Middle East, who has become the teams latest target. But everything is not as it seems.Michael Bay is a director with a style as distinctive as any established Hollywood hack. Slo mo action scenes, sweeping visuals and stylised, brutal violence have come to define his films. Truth be told, the man has always been better suited to directing video games than movies, which require more of a solid foundation to make them succeed, such as strong writing, good dialogue and effective characterisation. 6 Underground opens in the heat of a close up car chase, frenetically moving along while characters bark dialogue to the screen, and ending with the death of one of them. But since we've established as much of an emotional connection with them as the others, it's a bit moot.Bay's films have never been known for their L.A. Confidential style, labyrinth plots, but this is truly the flimsiest excuse for a plot I've ever known, further compounded by Bay engaging in some Bad Boys II style over indulgence, stretching at over two and a half hours, which the plot isn't strong enough to sustain. It wouldn't be so bad if there was an engaging story with characters you cared for, but it's just not the case. In the lead role, Reynolds applies his edgy, wise cracking style to the proceedings, but is not enough to lift it on his own, while a strong supporting cast including Melanie Laurent, Ben Hardy and Corey Hawkins is wasted.It thinks it's funny, it thinks it's slick, but, it's just crap. *",

As one user stated, this is \"the most Micheal Bay movie Micheal Bay ever Micheal Bayed\", and IMO the funnest movie of the year, if not in the last 2+ years!I can't believe the low rating and the critics negative responses. David Fear of Rolling Stone called it \"another lingerie catalogue sprinkled with carnage\"... umm yaaaa, that's exactly what the viewers want! This film is meant to be adrenaline-inducing action, suspense, thrills, and entertainment all in one, and it delivered. It's not meant to be some psychological mind-bending thriller, just simple mindless entertainment. It was Bay at his best, with stunning visuals and amazing S/VFX. This film doesn't deserve anything less than a 7/10, strictly on production value and its visuals - even if you hated it.This film was made for Reynolds charisma and humor, and no one could've been cast better for his role. For that matter, casting overall was perfection - every single actor performed outstanding and looked and played their part.Even the score and soundtrack (I want it!) was outstanding. My only beef with this film, and the reason I didn't give it a 10, was the convoluted back and forth and all over the place timelines at the start. I'm not sure if editing/cutting length down is to blame, but I could've been presented much better. Nevertheless, the 127 min run-time was perfect and the pacing on point.I really hope Netflix doesn't get cold feet from the negative critics and not come out with a sequel, because this group of underground heroes need more stories to tell us! I will be watching this one again very soon, and it's a well deserving 9/10 from me!To see my 1000+ ratings and 700+ reviews, simply click on my user name. But go see this film first!",

Why the hell was the brother speaking English? Couldn't the producers make an effort to use Arabic??Overall it's a huge, huge mess - typical Michael bay fashion.

            "content": "There are so many things wrong with this movie on so many levels I still don't think I've fully processed it.I quite enjoyed the opening car chase. It was really, really silly but there were a lot of cool stunts and the film seemed not to take itself too seriously. Plus it got bonus points for killing off Dave Franco early.But then it started getting really dumb, offensively dumb and it slowly started dawning on me that this film was not (despite attempts to be funny- at no point was it actually funny) as tongue in cheek as I assumed it had to be.The plot is basically 'Team America: World Police' played straight and oversimplified to the point where you can only assume it must be targeted at young, particularly stupid children. A billionaire with unexplained crazy special forces skills decides he wants to make the world a better place by replacing an evil dictator of a fictional country with someone else thereby making solving all the problems in said country (you know, like America did in Iraq/Libya/Afghanistan). He decides to replace the bad guy with the bad guy's brother (who definitely won't turn into a dictator later on) and chooses to do this with 6 people none of whom are credible and all of whom are unfunny.They kill a lot of people, some of them quite creatively (credit where credit's due) for 2 hours and then main bad guy is killed by his own people in scenes disturbingly reminiscent of Gaddafi in Libya. The day is saved, everyone is free and happy again, children smile, old people are hugged, Americans win, yay! Cut to team walking away in a line smiling, making obligatory wisecracks, the End.Note: that the movie also has some of the most out of place, unwarranted sex scenes in a movie I've ever seen. For the record I genuinely like sex scenes, seeing beautiful women in movies, etc.. But I also like football and would be surprised if different actors pulled out a football for a kick around apropos of nothing multiple times.Note 2: The film was also insulting from a race point of view. Seeing shots of crowds of local brown people reacting emotionally on mass like simple, clockwork idiots to the TV broadcasts was unpleasant.From a technical point of view there was also plenty wrong. Some of the stunts were amazing but many of them were filmed in very difficult to see ways. Some of the camera work was also very good, but was constantly cut with other amateurish and badly filmed shots. For some scenes I can only assume the professional filmmakers all went on a break and let the winner of a competition direct for a bit (see the whole killing the generals in a hotel bit).I assume someone had some highly choreographed action scenes they really wanted to film but could not be properly bothered to film the bits in between or write a reasonable story to link them together. This pretty much sums up the movie for me, I get the feeling that the people who made this move just really couldn't be bothered to do a proper job (I have to believe this, the alternative is that this represents someone deemed accomplished enough to be given $150 million to spend's best storytelling efforts and that is frightening) .And the fact that a film this bad will get more views and more love than a dozen other much better movies combined really makes me wonder how anyone can delude themselves that we are any more than stupid monkeys that like things that go bang and not in fact the pinnacle of a supreme being's plan for all of creation. This movie makes me despair at all of humanity.",

It's definitely one of the craziest movies I've ever seen. I kind of understand why the critics are not liking this movie, but at the same time it's a piece of real action that you don't get to see these days.\n1. It's like an amped up hybrid of 'Fast and Furious' and 'Mission Impossible'.\n2. It's incredibly shot, with a lot of attention to detail, which is mindblowing given the fact that this isn't 'Transformers' and they couldn't CGI the hell out of it.\n3. The locations are brilliantly chosen, they are stunning and utilized to the max.\n4. The storyline isn't great but it's still pretty decent and it feels original so you don't feel like you've seen it all before. In fact, there's a lot I haven't seen before so I was surprised round every corner.\n5. Action is the word driving the whole thing. It's nonstop action (with only short pauses to catch your breath) but it doesn't feel tiring, except maybe the opening chase scene, which does seem to go for a bit too long. This is the only bit of the movie that felt strained and overdone. (And we know how Michael Bay likes to do these too-long chase scenes in 'Transformers', don't we?)\n6. Except Ryan Reynolds, the actors are relatively unknown, which should take away from the movie but it doesn't, because of the amazing chemistry that they have and the script that allows them to really embody their characters. So it's like you're watching something real (which, again, rarely happens in movies these days).\n7. The movie's hilarious. There's a lot of funny situational stuff and funny banter, and Ryan Reynolds' character has his own thing going on on top of that.\n8. Weirdly, all the crazy stunts that the 6 pull off seem quite real and doable so you're not watching some superheroes doing some stuff you only see in movies. This looks like a properly trained human being could do it.\n9. The soundtrack rocks.\n10. I have to mention again how well this movie is shot. Michael Bay has his style, and he likes to film helicopters, that for sure, but all in all, this is spectacular directorial work. If you just think of all the ideas and planning that must have gone into this movie to make it look the way it does, it truly is impressive.\nSign me up for the next instalment yesterday.",

Bay takes the most generic premise, fills it with characters that scream clich\u00e9, envelops all of it with his patented action mayhem and still he somehow manages to make it function smoothly.Overall, 6 Underground isn't a film for you if you are trying to make sense of it all even after the opening segment. It's fast, it's furious, it's nonsensical, it's brainless, but purely from entertainment standpoint, it is an endlessly enjoyable & gleefully violent popcorn extravaganza that presents Michael Bay getting the most mileage out of something that others would spectacularly fail at.Just sit back, relax & allow yourself to go with the flow, and you might come out more pleased, surprised & satisfied than usual.

It starts off with a chase scene that is infantile at best and nauseating at worst.First the nausea; there were so many jump cuts, the editing was all over the place that it was really annoying and not at all fun to watch, not if you're older than twelve anyway.The infantile; so, we have Ryan Reynolds and some other actors who I didn't or couldn't recognize because the camera barely focused on them, in a chase scene that made no sense and looked more like a bad video game than an action movie. There was a guy running across roofs, not sure why except that it looked cool, and four people in a car running from the bad guys and engaging in witty repartee while scores of innocent bystanders are killed in terrible ways. I suppose it was supposed to be cool but in fact it was just infantile and pretty offensive. At one point you have the female doctor (we know she's a doctor because of the idiotic intro graphics for each character, sort of like a comic book for children) tell the driver angrily that if he hits one more person she's getting out of the car. They then proceed to hit about a dozen more people without a word from her. Maybe this movie would have worked as a cartoon?And of course it was made in 2019 so you just have to have the hard-ass but beautiful female agent who's a crack shot from a moving car even though she appears to be grievously wounded...please.I imagine this movie would be a teenagers wet dream but for adults....I bailed before the first chase scene even ended. The movie may have gotten better after that but I seriously doubt it and I had better things to do with my time then hang around to find out. While Michael Bay will never be confused with any of the great directors he usually makes fun movies, he needs to dial back a bit on the jump cuts and shaky camera nonsense, and possibly go back to making movies for adults.And as far as the high reviews for this movie, even though there aren't many, you're entitled to your opinion but there's no need to insult those who disagree with it. For those of us who hated this movie it's not that we don't \"understand modern cinema\", it's not that the movie industry has \"passed us by\", it's just that we didn't like the movie. if you need to denigrate, dismiss or insult others opinions while writing a movie review you seriously need to grow up.",

This is at the end of some type of mission which went very wrong. Inside are the driver who ends up dead after all this, the passenger called 1, a pretty Dr. 5, a CIA spook who has been shot and is being operated by 5. Elsewhere part of the team are an angry frustrated hitman, and a robber/parkour artist.When this is over we learn that 1 is a self-made tech billionaire who decided to improve the world so he decided to assemble this team and take out bad guys. They all have to fake their deaths and then live as \"ghosts.\" Their base is an old plane out in the plane graveyard in the California desert. The next mission is to take out the dictator of Turgistan. 1 replaces the driver with...a sniper for some reason. The plan involves staging a coup, taking out the bad dictator, and installing his brother in power. The dictator has his brother basically prisoner in a mansion. So first they have to free the brother, then take over the airwaves with a message to get the people to revolt, and finally grab the dictator and turn him over to the people to face justice.All of this takes forever and is overly complicated and as with Bay movies, all the brain-frying action and noise eventually backfires and make you lose interest and track of whatever the main story is supposed to be. And as with most big budget action movies there's a dizzying amount of globe-trotting going on although here it seems they are going in circles around the same couple of countries often playing the unbelievable role of other countries.In terms of characters, we learn that the hitman has a mother in a convalescent hospital, he starts a relationship with the CIA spook. For a moment there it seemed like we would learn how 1 recruited everybody on the team, but we only learn that for the robber and of course for the sniper. Infuriatingly underused is 5 played by the gorgeous Adria Arjona. We learn noting about her and she doesn't get to do a whole lot in the movie. What makes this movie a bit different is that even though the members of the team are all pros at their respective jobs, the missions tend to go awfully wrong, so that's a bit refreshing here. This isn't the glamorous team that plans impossible jobs and has everything go its way while posing around like models. We are also spared some type of sermonizing which action movies like to do as well of late.I haven't seen Bay movies in decades, but I do enjoy the bright, colorful cinematography also used in 6 Underground. The action is cool, fun, violent, gory. But again somewhere 3/4 into the movie we needed a break from all the mayhem. The characters are ok, the story is alright. The script is \"written-for-Reynolds\" type stuff. Perhaps slightly less annoying than usual, but still, the bickering between 1 and the hitman could have been toned down. No surprise that it came from the same people behind Deadpool. Reynolds should distance himself from this stuff, it's starting to turn into a caricature of a caricature.Recommended as a fun wild ride of an action movie.",

They kill evil men such as dicators and the likes to make the world a better place.The plot is as stupid as the over the top violence,f-bombs and braindead slo-mo action and the shameless world record in product placement in one movie. So much product placement, that the movie actually comes with a warning about it.\nNow I don't mind braindead action or extreme violence in movies. Both can be fun. If the story works and the main characters are likeable. Like in the John Wick movies. This movie has neither going for it.So watching a guy drop dead to the ground with entrails coming out of his throat after having his head blown to bits with a flash grenade and then Ryan Reynolds character reacting to that, telling his team they should split up is disgusting and not funny. And I'm not offended by violence at all or oneliners attached to it. But that was too much, even for me. The same goes for the eyeball scene in the movies opening. Disgusting. Non-stop action for 20 or 30 minutes, with no clue about whats happening. Typical Bay.Ryan Reynolds plays the same character/action hero, or himself, if you will, in every movie he is in. Out of the 150 million dollar budget, Reynolds received a paycheck of 27 million dollars. For that money he did a lot of action, said some supposedly funny oneliners and dropped about 200 f-bombs. Not worth the paycheck, if you ask me.In my opinion moviestars and soccer players make way too much money.And don't even get me started on the soundtrack. There was no actual movie score here. Just a lot of the annoying crappy songs, that the stupid kids born in the new millennium, consider good.The worst acting in the movie comes from Payman Maadi, an actual American, whose phony accent made him sound foreign and was the only thing more annoying than his terrible acting.Avoid this unless youre a dimpled teeenbage-boy or some moron in your twenties that prefers violence and action over plot, because youre too stupid to get an intelligent plot. If youre one of those, you will love this crap. Anyone else: watch the John Wick movies instead.As for the moron who says this isnt Scorsese or Mann, but Bay and make it sound like a good thing. FYI buddy: Scorsese and Mann has made some ogf the best masterpieces ever as well as some bad movies. But to compare them to Bay is like comparing a big juicy steak with a beer on the side to a vegan meal with oatmilk on the side. Scorsese and Mann are genius filmmakers.

Trust me, if I had seen it in the beginning, I'd have stopped watching it right there and saved my time. I'd rather watch End Game once again to satisfy my entertainment appetite of the weekend evening.Guys, save your time.\nNetflix, save your money and have such scripts reviewed first.",

That is simply haters of Reynolds or Bay in general. I can understand your dislike, but take off the blinders. This movie is just as much a 1 as it is a 10. Both are moronic ratings and can be disregarded. In reality this movie is exactly what you expect, wall to wall action. The opening car chase is excessively long, and highly entertaining. All of that just to lead you into the movie. For those who just want the action and no story, this movie isn't overly complex, just the method of storytelling will lose you if you aren't paying attention (hence the one ratings by the children on here). Reynolds is the main star, and delivers the usual deadpan one liners throughout, half of which don't seem to hit the mark quite as well as he normally does, but the material wasn't quite as spot on as \"Deadpool\" so can't blame him for it. Almost seems crazy that a movie of this magnitude and budget heads directly to netflix. I have to say this would've looked great on an IMAX screen. Thoroughly enjoyed this movie, and if you don't understand the quick editing technique, you apparently aren't aware Michael Bay started out making music videos and that is just the way they are shot. Using it in high action scenes is just a style, take it or leave it, but please leave the reviewing for people who have brains and don't allow bias to oversway logic. As I stated before seeing this, grab the popcorn, check reality at the door, kick back with a beer and enjoy 2 hours of nearly non-stop action.",

            "content": "In the age of three-minute YouTube videos and flashing Instagram stories, 6 Underground is siren-loud in a bid to deafen us long enough to make away with our attention spans. Like a child riding out a sugar rush, it guarantees a sensory overload - and a drilling migraine.The opening of Michael Bay's 2019 action thriller presents us with not one, but six impossibly witty, dexterous and specialized agents led by Gray (Ryan Reynolds), who go on to act as nameless Robin Hoods in a world controlled by soulless, cackling dictators.The opening car chase scene introduces us to the protagonists, thrusting us into their speeding Lamborghini as they annihilate the streets of Italy while trying to get away from the black-robed mafia. Pedestrians are arm-flailing bowling pins to them. For a group of self-proclaimed saviors of humanity, that in itself seems like a contradiction.But it takes us about five minutes to realize that we're going to have to work overtime to connect with any of the characters. Those familiar with Ryan Reynolds' work will perhaps relate to Gray, as he is basically playing himself.How is it possible to engage the audience if the main characters are as disposable as tissues? It's not. They are nameless even within their own circle, choosing to exist as numbers instead, dumping each other's lifeless bodies into the river without shedding a tear. The unnecessarily gory scenes, featuring smashed noses, a gelatinous eye dangling from a squishy optic nerve and harmoniously snapping bones, do little to drive the story forward. If anything, they seem to be a desperate embodiment of the belief that we simply can't look away from a car crash.The movie seems to follow in the footsteps of Zack Snyder's 2011 Sucker Punch. It knits the plot into a video game. There is no concrete goal that the characters are working towards. No single aim to justify their morally-dubious behaviour. Instead, we are gifted with countless villains, popping up at the same time. Again, 6 Underground seems to have adapted the materialistic approach. The more one-dimensional, cartoon-ish criminals, the better.What could save the film in the eyes of a selected few would be the explosive visuals and eye-catching cinematography. Like a beautifully designed video game providing surface-level engagement. Stupefying our senses.All in all, maybe skipping certain parts, like the story intervals interrupting an action-packed video game, would make it more bearable. Letting your thoughts race and hover somewhere above the television screen. Then again, I can't imagine a three-minute YouTube video failing to divert your attention from the flashing screen while 6 Underground is on.",

Then, it cuts back to four months prior to a car chase with gunfire and killing. There's not a real story here - the main character of One (Reynold's) doesn't explain why he's in a car chase with other people.For the entirety of the movie, you kind of get what they characters are doing and why, but there's no real character development; just a titbit of background and the rest open-fire.The real adventure nuts might enjoy it, as it's a pure adrenaline rush of a movie, and while I enjoyed it, I need depth to the story as well as fleshed out characters, which you think that a movie such as this goes for two hours and eight minutes could afford.Because of the lack of character development, I didn't feel much empathy for the characters.Some of the soundtrack choices are a bit predictable and felt that they shouldn't be there, but, instead, replaced by something else.It was kind of funny, but kind of not.The way that this movie was edited, too, left something to be desired; it was all over the place in the narrative!I like Ryan Reynolds and that is why I decided to watch this film, as well as after reading the synopsis. However, I wouldn't say that the action started after he faked his own death, though, as the synopsis would lead you to believe, but before.Would I watch it again? Eh.

From the very start, this film was fast paced, quite brutal in fact. There is a hell of a lot going on; and to all those who complained about the slow motion scenes, no, they really really work. If these scenes had not been in slo mo it would have been far too quick and the impact of the stunts would have gone unnoticed. There are some excellent stunts in this movie, they really put a lot of effort into the production of this film. I will be watching this again, because there is so much going on, I reckon I have missed somethings. I give it a 9 star rating instead of a 10 only because a few moments were silly; i.e. Bullets don't just cause a dent on the metal of a car, they go straight through, and would injure or kill anyone inside the car.

They're ghosts having faked their own deaths.\nBurying their pasts so they can change the future.\nA mishmash of Mission Impossible, The Expendables and The Losers.\nIt's pure popcorn fun. Not to be taken seriously.\nThis film is like a 2hr 7 minute long MTV music video.\nIt's glitzy and stylised but with no real substance.\nLittered with mistakes and lack of continuity. Bay has spent more time focusing on the crash bangs and wallops and forgot small details like when a vehicle gets damaged only to be magically unscathed in the next shot.\nBut let us turn a blind eye as this is pure eye candy.\nBringing me on to the movies greatest strength.\n6 Underground looks absolutely stunning.\nA UHD Dolby Vision presentation, this is the best looking movie available on Netflix.\nThe Dolby Vision High Dynamic Range compliments Michael Bays style of film direction.\nColours pop and blacks are inky. If you own a 4K TV with Dolby Vision compatibility then prepare to have your socks blown off!\nDetail is razor sharp. Every pore,wrinkle and facial hair is visible on Ryan Reynolds face.\nCar paintwork shimmers and glistens.\nBeautiful people look even more beautiful.\nSunsets and neon lights are squintingly bright.\nThis film boasts many specular highlights that will showcase the talents of a good TV or HDR projector.\nEach scene fizzes with visual splendour.\nIf this film looks this radiant on Netflix imagine how good it's going to be on 4K Blu-ray with absolutely no compression.In terms of audio quality,\n6 Underground is offered with Dolby Atmos object based audio.\nThis yet again is demo worthy.\nRemember people this is streaming content but it is still mightily impressive.\nBass is deep with gunfire and explosions giving the most macho of subwoofers a thorough workout.\nSurround sound effects are steered masterfully around the room.\nThe Alfa Romeo's sonorous 2.9 litre turbo V6 is bellowed through each speaker during the opening car chase.\nEnough to give a petrol head an orgasm.\nMusic pounds the senses with a rather long listed soundtrack.\nLike I said this could have been a feature length MTV video.\nHeight channels are constantly fed something to have you staring up at your ceiling. A certain scene as a helicopter flys overhead was very impressive.So to sum up, 6 Underground is a mediocre movie in terms of storytelling.\nFor the most part there is no story. But as a visually engaging piece of entertainment, Michael Bay has done what he always does.\nHe's given us eye candy.\nA 2hr long TV demo reel.\nYou can just see a leading TV manufacturer using this film to showcase their latest model.\nTake your brain out and enjoy.",

            "content": "6 Underground (2019, Michael Bay)\nHoly Michael Bay Batman! Between this film and 'The Irishman' it becomes apparent that in order to lure big name directorial talent to their banner Netflix allows film makers an exceptional amount of latitude to tell the story they want to. They give it to Cuaron and we get this sprawling black and white Mexican family drama 'Roma'. They give it to Scorsese and we get the 3 and half hour gangster epic 'The Irishman'. So what happens when you give that to Michael Bay? You get '6 Underground'. His visual euphoria and tools are so distinctive it is impossible not to know in the first 30 seconds of this film that you are watching nothing other than a Bay movie. He even channels his inner John Woo with some slow motion birds. After three minutes I texted a friend and said something to the effect of I feel like Michael Bay just ejaculated in my eye. He is that off the rails with his style in '6 Underground'. Lense flairs, quick edits, swooping pans, exploding cars every where. Everything is designed to illustrate form over function. Oh yeah there is an actual story here I guess. Ryan Reynolds heads a covert unaffiliated team of operatives who are starting to right some of the wrongs governments can't. Reynolds is mega quadzillionaire that got a bug up his ass one day and turned Dudley Do Right meets Deadpool. He faked his own death and now operates in complete anonymity off the grid. He has cobbled together five other specialists who share his cause and his fake death fate hence the title. The rest of the story really bares little consequence as this is all just an excuse to blow up, destroy and shoot stuff in new and invigorating ways. We do it in cool vehicles, with cool weapons and wind up with cool effects all shot in Bay's signature full on jazz hands style. I will say the inundation of sheer visual stimuli is a bit much and the script is beyond clunky, but this is destined to be a guilty pleasure cheese fest of the highest order. Sure it doesn't have many redeeming qualities or much in the way of brains but sometimes that is exactly how we want our action spectacles served. I genuinely struggle how to grade this. In the end I feel I must grade it as trash, but it is extremely slick trash, and hey, at the very least it has Ryan Reynolds in it!\nEric's Grade: D+",

I thought it would at least be a passable, mildly fun action film. That was all I wanted out of it, judging by Michael Bay's filmography. And here's why.Pros:\nIt's on Netflix so you don't have to leave home I guess? (I'm trying my hardest to find anything good to say about it.)Cons:\nDecent stunt work and practical effects ruined by bad editing and directing. You can tell the people behind the scenes gave it their best but sadly the effort and work were squandered by quick cuts, shaky cams and pointless slo-mo. Most of the action scenes would have been intense enough without all the aforementioned editing. It's as if Bay didn't trust the talent behind the stunts and felt the need to edit this way to add tension.Bad acting and poorly written script. Every character is unlikable and stays unlikable throughout the movie. You don't root for anyone or feel that their motivation makes sense.Even Ryan Reynolds doesn't look like he wants to be this movie. Not even one joke landed for me. Not a single chuckle. Plans go wrong not because of unforeseeable circumstances, but because of poor/lack of planning and execution. If the characters don't take a life-and-death situation seriously, why should you? And they are supposedly handpicked because of their skills by a billionaire genius with near limitless funding.Boring plot that is so easy to follow, yet the movie tries its best to confuse you with expositions. It punishes you for paying attention to details and you feel like the more you know about the characters, the more you hate them. Going in with your brain turned off is the least painful way to watch.Again, I would have been more than happy if the film had been just a mindless but fun action flick that you forget exists 5 mins after watching it but I felt as if it went out of its way to infuriate me for no reason.",

            "content": "So as the title says, this is what a lovechild of Michael Bay and Ryan Reynolds looks like. Lots of over the top action and explosions. It's got every emotion from humor, to sadness, to even some uncomfortable moments. Very much a \"Hard R\" movie. Obviously it's not for kids, and probably even some adults.I won't go into spoilers but I will say while it is a great action packed movie, the one flaw that seems to run throughout it is a weird pacing/editing issue. I'm no movie critic, I normally would not notice these things. But this movie suffers from this badly.Most movies have a start, middle and and end. The start tends to be an intro to whatever is going on. And it goes from there through its steps. But this has random sections where Ryans character \"1\" narrates on why the group is who they are. And every time its almost the same thing he said the time before but worded differently. It's as if they kept adding \"intros\" that should have been at the start, through the whole movie. Just feels weird.And you get into the random editing/pacing. Randomly you will go into a character's back story. And its not like you really realize it sometimes. It will just suddenly say on screen \"3 \"and some back story plays of 3s character. And its made worse by the movie being all over the place. One second they are in one place talking about something, the next there is a back story, the next they are in a new country talking about something else, then there is a new scene with a \"bad guy\" (mind you, they don't say where), then its back to some talking about why they are who they are, then them back at another scene. Random sex, random violence, random everything.I am in no way saying this movie is terrible. I gave it a 7 after all. Just saying be prepared for editing that feels like a little kid put it together at times. If you can get past that, it's not bad of a action movie. Also, don't expect any Oscars for this.",

Now back to this movie.The action is first class and what we should expect from one of the greatest action directors of our time coupled with a large budget.Anyone who has an issue with the acting is probably taking things a bit seriously and missing the point of this movie. I'd advise them to loosen up their tighty-whities.It's not an emotional roller coaster, it's not Oscar-worthy, but it's worth a watch if you enjoy a well-made film with a rock solid cast and kick-ass action sequences.

She didn't get to do much of anything, except treat a gunshot wound in a fast moving car at the beginning. I don't recall if she got a backstory.For a plot, they go after their #1 pick for their sleazebag list and the whole film consists of their efforts to thwart him. What about the guy at the beginning?

The car chases more chasey! The gun fights more shooty and there is a magnetic weapon which has some fantastically disgusting consequences.Ryan Reynolds is One, a billionaire who has faked his own death and recruited a team to help him set right the wrongs in the world. No names allowed just numbers. Their biggest mission yet is to replace a dictator with his far friendlier brother.Ryan Reynolds is at his wise-cracking best, throwing jokes and abuse around like bullets from a machine gun, but he also has a slight harsh edge to this character as well. Melanie Laurent is Two, an ex-CIA operative, hard as nails and twice and dangerous as anyone else in the film. Manuel Garcia-Rulfo is Three, a hitman with a great tendency to quote films whilst he fights. 'I see dead people' is my favourite, the timing is just perfect. He is an actor that is fast becoming one of my favourite action stars. Ben Hardy is Four, a parkour runner who gets in a whole world of poop during the film. Which is fair enough as everyone else has some kind of military training and he runs up walls really quickly. He is also the character you worry about most of all, a very likeable actor and character. Adria Arjona is Five, a Doctor, and we honestly do not learn much more about her, except she is bliming handy with a scalpel during a high-speed chase. Dave Franco is Six, and his scenes at the wheel of the getaway car are some of the funniest! And Corey Hawkins in new recruit Seven, a sniper with a past. Never leave a man behind!The reviews of this film have not been great, but we absolutely loved it. Shell loves a good death scene, and this has some of the goriest and funniest ones going. The characters interacts really well and are a team you cannot help but like. It is fast, action packed, funny and well-written and acted. Hopefully this is the start of a series of films.

The story and script of the film - as is par for a Bay film - are simply there to take you from one set piece to the next and I appreciate some people want more than that. For me, films can be many different things and if you watch a Bay movie expecting anything other than what you get, that's your fault, not his. It's loud, it's unrealistic, the script (even with some genuinely funny one liners) is bad, the characters are mainly one dimensional, the villain is stereotypical and cliche, but Bay fans e left all that.We watch for the action...and oh my god does he deliver. The second act ends with an infiltration that most over action films would have as their ending. The opening car chase is a second act in pretty much any other film. The 3rd Act is truly something we haven't seen before.Absolutely loved it and hope they make a sequel soon.",

Mostly it is just one big incoherent mess, very fragmented plot that would literally give a normal person ADHD. Absolutely no character development or chemistry to make you care one way or the other about anyone. A bunch of uncalibrated character personalities that waver and jump around much like the story which is very sporadic and stupid. A huge waste of money and talent. Michael Bay only had 1 good film and that's 13 Hours save for maybe The Rock and the first Bad Boys movie. I was so disappointed that I actually stopped watching after 1 hour then went back to finish and wish I hadn't. I can sit through Green Latern with very little difficulty but THIS movie just plain sucks, no redeeming qualities whatsoever. 2/10.",

Kill dictators with own resources, because international community sank in bureaucracy.Very beautiful shots: sunsets, helicopters, skyscrapers.Cons:\nRealization of the idea is like the movie has been shot by 13 years old kid.All heroes have the same temper: they shout, they curse.Ridiculous scenes. CIA agent is awaiting the target in Rolls-Royse in the middle of the road. Yes, sure, all agents do that.Mistakes. In the beginning of the movie car crashed by its left side and lost left mirror. But in further shots we see that car has left mirror.Incomplete scenes. On the roof they moved by wire. Number 4 was behind them. And suddenly Number 4 said that bad guys cut the wire and he cannot follow. But we didn't see that bad guys cut the wire! Bad guys even didn't follow good guys.Stupid jokes. Joke about belt and stroking. What?! Yes, sure, this would work in real life.American narrow-minded thinking. They announce revolution under american song. Yes, sure, turgestanians will be motivated with this song.Stupid obstacles. On a yacht chip went our of a phone. What?! What the heck the phone is that chip can easily go out?!And there are a lot of similar mistakes and illogical stuff. E.g. CIA agent blinks while shooting. Really?

Not unwatchable, but definitely not in the \"so bad it's good\" category.\nThere's plenty of action from the get go. There is an overarching plot (somewhere). It has humour, emotion, violence. But no two scenes seem to follow each other coherently. Every third scene is a flashy camera pan that makes you feel dizzy to the point of nausea. Scenes are disjointed and littered with character flashbacks; it feels like films today have to explain everybody's backstory, when the characters aren't remotely interesting and you aren't allowed to organically connect with the relevant characters through good old fashioned dialogue and development. Plus, where's the room for a prequel?\nThey've gone to town with locations but I've struggled to follow the linearity of the story to appreciate the switch from one city to another, or from one character scene to another. It feels like an expensive TV movie with a budget writer, director and producer. It rips off films like Die Hard, the Fast and the Furious, Mission: Impossible, James Bond and even The Expendables.\nBy all means watch this film but do not finish the film saying \"that was a good film\". The films it's taken inspiration from Are good films (yeah even the directors cut version of the Expendables). Maybe watch those first.",

Most of them are garrish and way over the top. He's the guy that lights all the fireworks at once instead of in a sequence with a nice finale.On the other hand, Ryan Reynolds is in it. I don't know if there is a better actor for inserting comedy into an action movie.The tiebreaker was Netflix. In other words, I'm already paying NF however many dollars a month so I'm watching something.\"6 Underground\" was a blast. It was a cornucopia of awesomeness. Michael Bay reeled it in a tad and Ryan Reynolds did his thing. The action sequences were stylistic, cool, and didn't defy every known law of physics. The one-liners from Reynolds were on point and in steady supply. The CGI and visual effects were stunning. I was particularly impressed by the super slo-mo sequences; they were done right and at the right time. Like an RPG catching a guy in the mouth before exploding, or a mother and her baby being narrowly missed by a car. There were some fantastic shots.The comedy, the action, and the cinematic beauty was all propped up by a good plot. The 6 Underground were none other than six highly skilled folks doing some super-spy stuff for a noble and worthy cause. Reynolds character was the brains and the financier. He was a billionaire who was tired of seeing no real change in the world no matter how much money he spent philanthropically.I know, I know, you're saying to yourself, \"Spy movies are a dime a dozen,\" and you're right. I can't believe I'm raving about it myself, but you owe it to yourself to watch this one. If you like Michael Bay you should watch. Even if you don't like Michael Bay, but you like Ryan Reynolds, you should watch. If you don't like either of them I have one last proposition: this movie is like Mission Impossible but funnier.

The Dialogues might as well been written by Zuckerbot himself, based at a belief that this is how real humans talk. People doesn't make long sarcastic jokes when being in a high speed car chase and bullets flying. All characters have no regards what so ever to what's happening around them. Like they don't realise that they are about to die at any second. When you watch movie like Bad Boys, they are shouting, cursing in midst of the action. These characters do nothing like this - their behaviour is alien-like.Continuing.The timeline jumps back and forth in a mind-boggling way. A rear view mirror is lost upon a collision with a truck, only to be respawned a second later when the movie is cut to a different camera-view. and that's after the first 10 minuets.Still continuing. There is no real chemistry between the actors nor ANY logical explanation to why the other characters choses to follow Ryan Reynolds lead. Ryan Reynolds character is multi billionaire whose technical inventions are in all modern electronic products, yet in the movie he is completely unknown to the world. Basically, he is a male model version of Elon Musk gone Robin Hood. The Actions scenes are great though. Car chases, fights, shoot-outs are all excellent made. However, somebody please tell me why you would need to hire an acrobat for your super-secret swat team? If the movie didn't try so hard to be serious I would have laughed through it all. But it just becomes so ridiculous when the same Acrobat first need to grab his skateboard and grind a rail to get into position so he can shoot the driver in the chasing car, instead of just stopping and shooting up the car straight away.Anybody rating this movie 6 or higher must have been on drugs when watching it, and I wish I had been too.",

All of Michael Bay's trademarks, but funny and entertaining. One of the only Michael Bay movies I can think of that's has quality. Mark Wahlberg, Rob Cordry, Tony Shaloub, and Dwayne Johnson are all hilarious.",

If it was a parody, then it would been a phenomenal movie (especially when Ryan Reynolds is in it).Unfortunately this is your typical good guys that kill bad guys kind of movie and Ryan Reynolds just can't fit in that character. Everyone fits nicely in their typical-action-cliche roles but Ryan Reynolds is not the type to play someone like a leader of the group. He is quirky and kinda awkward, which is not suitable for a character that tries to stick to the main mission no matter what.Cheesy scenes with typical cliche outcomes. Nothing will surprise you.",

The opening long car chase which is crazy, insane, and a big set piece all together. Fast cars, explosions, helicopter, and bloody and gore with an eye ball is all in the opening sequence. Which sets the tone on how the rest of the 2 hour movie would be. Michael Bay direction does it again in his Bayhem style of fast editing, humor, action, and explosions. The plot may be simple after the movie jumps around with the time frame. From flashing back towards One (Ryan Reynolds) explaining his motive to hunt notorious criminals and bad Presidents. Flashing back to when he recruits the others to his team on faking their deaths and becoming ghosts. It is kind of like the A Team. A dysfunctional team traveling around the globe with a mission on extraction, termination, or trying to set up a plan. But it always ends up in a bloody shoot out and being chased.The plot is thin but about a team stopping criminals that are causing trouble to lots of people. The vigilante squad does things there own way. No government. No law.The movie is action packed throughout with a lot of set pieces. The opening car chase is a long 20 minute action packed. Kind of cheesy. But very entertaining. Every other scene there is more action to follow. Characters running and jumping on skyscrapers. Intense fight sequences. And a big climatic fight in a yacht with lots of bad guys and bullets. And a lot of destruction. It is a fun and exciting movie which is best to leave your brain and thoughts on logic out.The cast ensemble is great. Ryan Reynolds is a lot of fun. Melanie Laurent, Manuel Garcia-Rulfo, Ben Hardy, Adria Arjona, Dave Franco, and Corey Hawkins are all great with their characters. It is a perfect ensemble. Which this film can be a start of a franchise.If you enjoy Michael Bay's movies than this is a movie for you. Or if you are looking for an action packed movie. This will satisfy for sure.

They would deliver a line, in the hope it would come across funny, but really it seemed more like a rehearsal and the director should have told them to be more convincing. Very weak direction.This may have had a \"Whiskey Cavalier\" feel about it, however \"Whiskey Cavalier\" nailed it. This didn't. I would sooner have a second series of \"Whiskey Cavalier\" than a second \"^ Underground.\" Sometimes the wrong franchises get renewed.If this is to be the start of more stories as is implied, there is a need to go back to the drawing board.",

Director was focusing more on action scenes and it seems that they were keen to cash on their action scenes as it is filled with car chases, bullets flying in air, electronic foot tapping music and that's it.Direction of the movie is average, screenplay of the movie is so fast paced as sometimes you will get confused as what is happening in the movie. Action scenes are superb and deserves an applause. Cinematography is amazingly beautiful and climax is predictable and director has left a scope for it's sequels.Overall if you are a hardcore action lover then this is for you and if you are also looking for an interesting plot along with action then you will be disappointed.",

Now, on the NetFlix platform, Bay returns to regain his title of the explosion mayhem king-Taking the recipe transparently from Fast & Furious guys, we see a loose team thrown together to structure the crazy CGI effects, and add quip humor, in a movie form made to stream.

If you like tense situations involving explosions and seeing impossible things blow up, fall, and explode- all to pop rock beats. You will love this.

Did I actually watch this or did I somehow slip into Michael Bay's mind and witness a dream of his?The action was just so incredibly generic, the constant car flips and explosions, the parkour chase scenes, the shooting of gormless rent a thugs, the inevitable survival of our team of 'heroes'. The car chase at the start through Florence somehow felt Transformers like, in the way that the cars went flying through the air. In addition to the generic car chase sequences, the gun fights felt like something I'd scene a million times before, as did the (limited) hand to hand combat scenes. None of the action really hit the spot for me on this one, and I found myself experience a constant level of boredom throughout.The plot was all a bit bizarre, and to be honest I'm not entirely sure what was going on with the non-linear story telling in the first act. It was all far too confusing and wholly unnecessary, adding nothing to the picture. I think Bay was attempting to add a semblance of high brow to this generic and run of the mill film. I'm not really sure why any of the characters decided to fake their deaths and turn to a life of magnanimous mercenary work, but I'm not entirely sure I cared.Speaking of the characters, I really was not emotionally connected to any of them. They were about as two dimensional as film characters come, and I found myself not caring at all about their fates.6 Underground also displayed some of Michael Bay's 'humour'... which much like the action just didn't hit the mark for me. Even Ryan Reynolds couldn't save the godawful script, and I'm really none the wiser at to why he signed on for this. Surely Deadpool has lined his pockets enough that he doesn't have to bother with films like this?A lacklustre and derivative attempt at an action thriller which falls flat on so many notes.

If not, buckle up and enjoy the ride!6 Underground is adrenaline-packed action flick that reminds a lot of Mission Impossible -movies, with the slight difference that this is more fun and somewhat gory presentation. Not so serious stuff here.The movie opens with a 20+ minute car chase around beautiful Venice, that nicely presents the main characters to us. Fast cars, funny details (A baby! A dog! David!), exhilarating stunts and exploding objects. Great opening!After that, the plot is basically this: a team of \"ghosts\" are trying to stop a mass-murdering dictator in a made up country of Turgistan. Lot's of action follows in a similarly great, real locations around the world.The characters are somewhat memorable, each one has a place to shine and some good scenes together. Ryan Reynolds plays Ryan Reynolds, and he is good at it :)What strikes me most is how gorgeous the movie looks in 4K. This would have gone really well in theaters too, but oh well. The colors are vibrant, details pop out and camera-angles are interesting. It just looks soo good. Thanks for Michael Bay for that too.The budget for this movie was 150 million, and it shows. But I bet most of the money comes from sponsors, there is SO MUCH of product placement here, not only showing the logos, and objects, but also in dialogue: \"A BMW is following us!\" or \"You just had to go with Ferrari?\" If you'd start a drinking game with product placement spotting, you'd be wasted after the opening scene.But overall everything plays out really well. Fun movie, looking forward for a sequel!",

And the action is there to make up for the flaws.Biggest downside however was that in the end, it felt like I was watching a (decent) fast & furious ripoff with all the lollygagging and nonsense about \"family\", but unfortunately without the actual star power to keep you glued to the screen. The sequel had better have The Rock in it!",

It was on the boringish side and the story wasn't straightforward, It felt too complex yet not explained. It took 30 minutes to realize who is who and why they are where they are. It works for thrillers,but this is not it and it just didn't work. Because of it, it lost some valuable time to get to know the actors. I didn't like anyone, I didn't care about anyone. If most of them died, I wouldn't care and that's not good for a movie.Action: There was a good amount of it,but it wasn't sequenced well or shot well either so it felt not enough at times.Acting: Good by some and just average by some \"team members\".If you like action movies, It's a nice flick to watch, as long as you don't expect too much. I rated Hubs and Shaw really law for a ton of action,but beyond horrible directing with 100s of flaws.

It was pathetically rudimentary and formulaic. Ryan Reynolds should stick to what he does best- boy next door rom-com. And this movie should go directly in the trash. Most people are more intelligently evolved than this barbaric garbage.PS. Parkour. Really?",

She was a \"doctor performing surgery in the car\" with blood intermittently splattering all over her face and that was it. She had another role walking around in a pink dress- and then was locked in the closet on the yacht then somehow made it onto the helicopter...The best part of this movie was the song from Muse in the beginning.",

These scenes are slick to be sure, albeit the magnet scenes are daft, but it's almost impossible to work out what's going on amidst the explosions and general carnage - no car just crashes, they all somersault 10 times before exploding and crushing another 5 or 6 onlookers. The movement between black humour and serious message is uncomfortable, indeed Reynolds seems to be making a different Deadpool type movie.Liked the architecture a lot, but otherwise this is a facile, hollow exercise from a boy who likes playing with toys.",

And suddenly Number 4 said that bad guys cut the wire and he cannot follow. But we didn't see that bad guys cut the wire! Bad guys even didn't follow good guys.Stupid jokes. Joke about belt and stroking. What?! Yes, sure, this would work in real life.American narrow-minded thinking. They announce revolution under american song. Yes, sure, turgestanians will be motivated with this song.Stupid obstacles. On a yacht chip went our of a phone. What?!

Despite all the bloody scenes and intense action, Ryan Reynolds' comedic timing keeps the movie light-hearted. I like to think of this movie as something not for the mind, but for the eyes. It's a visual treat but won't exercise your brain. In fact if you do choose to exercise it, you'd only find loopholes and unexplained logic. So, I'd avoid doing that.The plot of the movie is fairly simple, the good guys vs bad guys and honestly at this point I'd be sick of this scenario with the hero and his corny one liners and predictable endings, if not for the amazing visuals and fast paced action offered, which makes it entertaining to watch nonetheless.In all, it's an entertaining action flick brought to you by the master of explosions and with everyone's favorite Ryan Reynolds and though it may have disappointed critics, it's a fun movie to watch.P.S. If you could somehow drop the Autobots and Decepticons in this movie even out of context, I'd still believe it to be a Transformers movie because it literally has everything else in it!",

But it didn't capture a single effective element.What's left is a hash of incoherent dialogues, half finished fight scenes, incomprehensible car chases and a non existing plot carried by the least motivated actors I've seen in a while. The only enjoyable part is that the movie doesn't shy away from showing creative death scenes.But even for fans of action, Michael Bay and Ryan Reynolds, this movie will remain an incomprehensible mess.",

            "content": "Wow it's about time to have Michael Bay to get his ass out of teenage mutant turtles films that he produced and to get his ass out of Transformers films take a break from it, time to bring new ideas and a new film that we never have seen and it's 6 Underground a Netflix film that could off been in theaters this felt like a movie that could of been in theaters. this is not just about story this is all about characters a lot more, and fun amazing stunt work a lot of creativethings you haven't never seen from first time with sick gore twist action SC-FI flick perfect writing i loved writing i loved characters, those type movies i loved is Expendables, The Losers, A-TEAM this is a next team it's morel like they are mixed of Expendables and A-TEAM is because they mercenary's, they go on mission is whatever they live or die and plus they are on team they are like ghost just like in A-TEAM they fake their death's and they are a ghost like they do exist but they fake their deaths. this is type of movie you see it for friday night or Saturday night or Sunday night type of flick that you watch when you feel like getting some whiskey pour a glass and put a movie on with your girlfriend and while watching this flick. don't expect a good story please don't because too many people want to many stories, the premise is almost original though Shallow, predictable it's a action film if youwant story then best for you to watch something else screw story we want more action then to story. it had great characters as well i loved characters, as well they were funny, they kicked a lot of ass in film, i liked their smart plans, their attitude as well. they have a mission to take down this ruthless in order to take down notorious criminals. the action was very well made very wellcinematography, it wasn't cheap at all it didn't feel cheap this is well made action flick nothing cheap crap, the action had a lot of dangerous stunts in it like with all another Michael Bay like The Rock, Island, Transformers but not with Robots and electrical and CGI, their is CGI but not a lot. Editing was sometimes jarring but most of the time keeps you on edge. (mostly) bland comedy that makes a few laughs in film and also given the R rating made this a lot better You can probably guess that it is by no means a realistic action movie, and you're right. That, and also, while the action is consistent, the hardcore impact. Lots of expensive cars getting blown up,a lot of hot actresses close ups with lens flare, high octane action and silly one lines from Ryan Reynolds acts like character just like Deadpool without the swords and tight costume, and doesn't have a messed up face like Freddy Kruger. The rest of characters please people don't take this seriously oh the characters are passable, that doesn't mean their acting is bad jeez it's not Oscar nommie movie awards. i reckon cast did their best in film i reckon that's the best they are been given what to do.story follows explaining One (Ryan Reynolds) motive to hunt notorious criminals and bad Presidents. Flashing back to when he recruits the others to his team on faking their deaths and becoming ghosts. It is kind of like Expendables, The A Team, Losers type of new Genre, i loved another characters like Two (M\u00e9lanie Laurent), Three Manuel Garcia-Rulfo, Four (Ben Hardy), Five (Adria Arjona), Six (Dave Franco) A dysfunctional team traveling around the globe with a mission on extraction, termination, or trying to set up a plan. But it always ends up in a bloody shoot out and being chased. you have Seven (Corey Hawkins) i am pretty surprised how they waste Dave Franco character he is in it for 5 minutes then Corey Hawkins takes over role, it feels like when James Franco was in Alien Convent for 30 seconds then he dies. but at least they had Dave Franco for like 5 minutes thats it.\nI'm not necessarily a Michael Bay fan but at least i enjoyed The Rock (1996), Bad Boys 1&2, i know why he didn't do Bad Boys III is because he directed this flick, The Island, Transformers films were good, Pain and Gain, 13 Hours: The Secret Soldiers of Benghazi that's his last film i enjoyed i wished that was a Netflix film and this could been in theaters rather then having this on Netflix this would of been a lot fun to see it in theater because action and all those crazy staff in it was right edge of my seat.i thought this was a lot of fun, gore was crazy as well i loved gore scenes and action was so creative, i don't know if you guys played call of duty black ops II the mission in cruise ship that was exactly like in this movie from game Call of duty black ops II. Ryan Reynolds and rest of actors looked like he had as much fun making this as I did watching as well just like me watching Expendables, Losers, A-TEAM this is one of my favorite movies of all time this is most enjoyable and more excited film then to Triple Fronter. i reckon this is my last\nfavorite movie in 2019 because nothing is on theaters in moment in December but this is one of my last films of 2019 and yes sometimes it's good to have the great movies to be last. sadly this film didn't get much ratings in Rotten Tomatoes like 34% still a lot higher but still come on what did they expect ?? nowadays i don't listen or read critics because they are completely wrong and don't know what it wants to be here is my easy of me saying it Pay attention tothe movie if you're not very bright you'll get lost. The cuts give you the backstory as to who the characters are the entire thing is just a Michael Bay action flick romp if you don't like that you won't like this at all people it's not a slow deep burn suspense type of movie it's full on action, gore, girls, cars, a lot of crazy car chases and a lot of dangerous work like Fast and Furious films\n10.10 hands down everyone it's a Netflix Friday night film to enjoy when you have nothing else to do or no plans to go out, watch this movie. Action, funny, entertainment for Friday night! Just sit, watch It, and relax. and get off your phones, don't bother looking at ratings and listening to the haters, because they don't know what they want from this movie.",

It's some of the most high octane BELIEVABLE action I've seen in a long time. And the story is actually interesting unlike the last couple Fast and Furious movies. The last thing they have over the Fast and Furious franchise is that while the characters are very likable, you also feel like they could die at any moment (aside from Ryan Reynolds).

Best parts of all in this movie were the injuries there were absolutely insane & the slowmo's that came with it! Who knew a flashbang would do that.\nId like to see Ryan do something with Keanu Reeves along with Jason Statham & Tom Cruise... Get a bit of a mixup between John Wick, Jack Reacher, & Transporter mix. I think this kind of mix up would outdo The Expendables..",

Technically it has gorgeous cinematography that has part commercial and music video feel, great action sequences ( the majority of which are done as practical effects as opposed to CGI) & a very good score.

You would need to be a Michael Bay fan to truly appreciate this film.6 Underground as a whole felt real lose, uneven, and improvised. The screenplay by Rhett Reese & Paul Wernick, both who wrote Deadpool 1 & 2, and Zombieland, was super dumb, with very inconsistent humor. Reese & Wernick tried to write this EXACTLY like Deadpool, and it just doesn't work.Ryan Reynolds played himself as always, which could have either partially saved the film for you, or made no difference, like it did to me. He had some humorous lines, but he just dishes out a mass of bad comedy. The supportive cast wasn't so bad, but they couldn't help but being generic as hell, feeling like they were hardwood cut-outs.Overall, this film just reeked of unoriginality, even Ryan Reynolds couldn't save it. 6 Underground felt like it should've been made around the same time as Bad Boys 2 (2003).

Violence without consequences is a cartoonJust the amount of money spent on the ridiculous opening sequences could have funded ten good films.And it keeps going, as I write this in real time. I suppose they think they can just completely overwhelm the mouth-breathers by never stopping-or even slowing down-to have any sort of story.I have a rule. If the trailer has more than one explosion, the movie is a huge dump fit only for disturbed adolescents. My rule is almost always true.",

I couldn't stop watching. It was a thrill ride to end all thrill rides. Great thing it wasn't in the theater - at my age I'd have to have had a restroom break, but there was simply no time. What little pauses in the action there were, are definitely places you need to pay attention to. The plot, as apparently some couldn't see, was actually more than one. The issues some have with not being able to follow it, I have but one suggestion - never watch Pulp Fiction, as your head would explode. I'm not necessarily a Michael Bay fan but might have to look into the membership fees for such. Ryan Reynolds looked like he had as much fun making this as I did watching it. The girls, the cars, the scenery, the action, and the girls were definitely a wonderful way to finish out a tough work week. NETFLIX, take note, always release an action film on a Friday after giving us small snippets to get us excited for the movie. This worked extremely well and actually cured my rough week.",

Add to that a lot of gory scenes and some quality dry humor, and you have the recipe for deconnecting.\nI was annoyed by just one fact: during the car chase in Florence, at one moment, the car enters Piazza del Campo in Siena (!), and then it's Florence again - really amazing how such an important detail could be missed..",

Anyway ,, I've recently watched the trailer of \"Free Guy\" and I think it would give us the Reynolds image we love.The other cast members were okay,, they were engaging, intense and at some points funny ,Manuel Garcia-Rulfo was really good with his spontaneous humor , and they did everything they could.,. but again the screenplay wasn't helpful.As for the set, the movie was apparently shot in Dubai , the country name is Turgistan or something like that ,, people are speaking Turkish with Arabic letters all over ,, It was a bit confusing for me when they talk about Turgistan and you can see \"Aldar Headquarters building\" or \"Shiek Zaied Mosque\" ,, If you don't know these landmarks then you wouldn't have an issue with that.So final say, it is a good Friday Netflix movie, it's not Bad,, but I wouldn't be sure that I would pay 8 dollars to watch it on the big screen,, I think that's why Netflix was the safest bet... so watch it on Netflix next weekend.",

Who are these people? Who is the billionaire? Why don't they ask for more of an explanation as to how RR found them and what exactly this organization is that he started? They are all fine with being told they are gonna kill \"bad\" people and in the process will pry die themselves...okaaaay...whut?I love Ryan Reynolds but I gotta say this movie kind of made me feel like I'm getting a little fed up with his constant snark in every thing he's in. I realize this is just a movie but it takes you out of movies when they are doing stuff the entire time that is just not anywhere near realistic. The constant cracking of jokes gets a little annoying. Also I'm sick of movies where pampered spoiled movie stars portray military members. These stars would be the first ones to run and hide under the nearest chair if any threat presented itself yet they think they can do justice to our military in these roles despite their complete lack of understanding of how the military works. It just seems akin to stolen valor to some extent. Don't portray military members if you're not gonna bother to at least try to lend some credibility to the role.This is disjointed, confusing and we aren't given enough information about these people in order for us to get invested in them. I was ready to turn it off after about 20 minutes but my husband wanted to watch it so...This seemed lazy for being an extremely expensive project and it was just way too over the top. My stars are for Ryan because I love him in spite of him becoming one note. I would give this a pass because it's confusing, ridiculous and more like watching the product of a bunch of people sitting around trying to outdo one another with a complete lack of consideration for any of the film being even remotely close to reality rather than the result of a good production.",

Not sure what is going on. I love action movies, especially great action movies. Last week I tried to watch the \"IMDB 7.5 rated John Wick 3\" and the fight scenes which make up 80% of that movie were totally and completely ridiculous. If there were 10 bad guys they would line up and take turns fighting john wick one by one. Tag team. And even then they'd stand there waiting to be hit. That movie is so bad, I tried twice and could only make it half way through (after paying for it!). So how in the world can that be a 7.5 and a movie of this quality be a 6.2? I don't get it. In any event, enough about that movie....This movie, 6 Underground was great. From start to finish. High quality in every category. Audio, Video, acting, story line, you name it. Special effects were outstanding. Everything in this movie was believable. An important litmus test for me at least. Special effects were amazing. Edge of your seat story.This movie is so good I am now getting very suspicious about where these bad reviews are coming from. Do reviewers have it our for Netflix or something? Crazy.You like action movies? Watch this movie. Outstanding. And if you like it, review it. Seems like we need some balance here.-Matt",

The scenery is beautiful & the way it fits into the chase is an object lesson in cinematography. Sadly that sets the tone for the rest of the film.\nStunning scenery & locations.\nStunning stunts & action scenes.\nAnd errrr. that's about it :-(\nSadly this film lacks a few important details.... such as direction and a cohesive storyline. No. Actually make that ANY storyline other than some phoned-in dialogue to enable Michael Bay to indulge in his love of big showy set-pieces with lots of explosions and lots.of slow motion.... I.mean, what the heck did writers Paul Wernick & Rhett Reese actually do to earn their place on the end credits? I actually felt sorry for Ryan Reynolds, forced to squeeze 'Deadpool' sass into an Armani suit. Talking of which, I assume the unrelenting barrage of product placement of high-end goods and toys for the 1%ers was the necessary evil to pay for the pyrotechnics? Reynolds turns in a decent performance, as does Ben Hardy & M\u00e9lanie Laurent. Dave Franco owns the scene he's in. Unfortunately he doesn't make it past the first set-piece. Which is a shame. Sadly everyone else is absolutely forgettable. I mean, the film has been over for 10 mins and apart from the aforementioned, I'm having genuine difficulty remembering any of the other actors lines or performances..One last comment \"Spoiler Alert!!\" What was that rubbish with the magnets on the boat all about??? It made the invisible Aston Martin in the excecrable 'Die Another Day' seem reasonable & rational...So disappointed & so annoyed that I lost an evening to this dross but I WILL give it two stars, if only for the opening chase sequence.",

There are the smash hit Deadpool movies of course, which he's perfectly suited to, but also see his nice work in Woman in Gold (2015) and The Hitman's Bodyguard (2017) which show more of his range. Anyway -- \"6 Underground\" is very much in the same genre as the later Fast and Furious franchise output, and neither much better nor much worse than any of those. Six agents fake their own deaths and make up a Mission-Impossible-type team of anonymous vigilantes who can operate outside the law and take down the worst baddies out there. In this case, it's the standard-issue evil dictator of \"Turgistan\".The plot is just a thin device to connect together three or four major action segments. The first and maybe best is an extended car-chase scene through Florence (and the sets are the real thing). Well done, but why do the police and bad guys seem to have an endless supply of cars and cycles to reappear anywhere and everywhere behind them? Since this is a Michael Bay film, don't bother asking. He likes to blow things up and fire lots of guns, so that's what's going to happen.It's technically well done and injects just enough human interest through the past lives of the 6 to make it all watchable, but I can't see this spawning a franchise.",

Taking propaganda to a whole new level, however, we are \u00a8taught\u00a8 in this film that coups and regime change are good things, and that when a group of foreigners decides to wage a coup, it\u00b4s just part of the natural stream of events that the dictator being deposed should be fed to the angry masses whom he oppressed.Sound familiar? This is the story of Libya, where Muammar Gaddafi was deposed and ultimately sodomized by bayonet and executed by an angry mob. The references to Sarin gas are obviously intended to rehydrate memories of claims that, in Syria, President Bashir al-Assad poisoned his own people.

Could be because former President Barack Obama is on their board. He was one of the primary perpetrators of the 2011 Libyan coup. He also armed rebels in Syria with the intention of overthrowing their \u00a8evil\u00a8 dictator. Sure, the rebels were former Al Qaeda affiliates, but let\u00b4s not quibble over details!When one thinks through what is being promoted here, it becomes clear that the warriors for justice are in effect themselves terrorists. They have self-ghosted themselves (pretended that they died) so that they can kill anyone they want anywhere they want for whatever reason they want. So what if thousands or even millions of entirely innocent people are killed, maimed, terrorized, left bereft and transformed into refugees along the way. All that matter are the killers\u00b4 own intentions! This is profound self-deception on a truly sociopathic level.Unfortunately, the very paradigm of propaganda woven into this movie has been used to resplendent effect in wrecking large swaths of the Middle East in the 21st century, where thousands of buildings and persons were in fact destroyed.",

Which was inconceivable, and then I saw that Michael Bay was directing - which accounted both for why a car rolling over into a curbside gelato cart warranted an explosion, and why this film is so pale.Add in the 'good billionaire' narrative they establish - a thing that does not exist - and I turned it off and found something better to do with my time; which is what drew the 1 star rating. Any movie I just cannot be bothered to even finish gets 1 star. This was a miserable affair, and I am sort of baffled as to why Reynolds took the job, he's been on such a roll.",

            "content": "Currently 18 minutes in and I have to say these are some of the absolute worst action scenes I ever had the displeasure of sitting through. 2 minutes in we see a mass of car parts collide and super over the top sparks fly from the wreckage, so fake its laughable. At 5 minutes we see the green car collide with a truck and the left wing mirror explode off, then for the next 5 minutes we clearly see in VERY obvious shots the wing mirror in tact and perfectly attached to the car, they almost make a point of zooming in on it at times. 10 minutes in another mass of fake sparks fly for no reason whatsoever, then they mess around with an eyeball for a few minutes which is ironic because I want to remove my eyes also. 18 minutes in we see a bad guy get hit with a noob tube, it strikes him on the tip of the nose and whizzes past but somehow he shakes his head and blood sprays from his mouth, I could almost hear the director yell 'now' before the fake blood was spit out like he's Triple H. Next we see them kick the front car window out like its a piece of paper and then they all bury James Francos less successful brother. Now we see a flashback of a Jon Jones wannabe and how he's upset because some of his squad gets killed in the army, I have never ever seen that in film before... yawn. Ryan and \"7\" spy on a funeral for giggles then deadpool narrates how theyre ghosts, ohhhhh scary. Now blake lively's husband shows his big magnet party trick and they plan to go and kill a guy because it sounds like fun. Ryan rescues a kid from Chernobyl 2.0 then sleeps with a random woman because he can. A fat guy dances in front of some hookers then him and all his friends get shot in the head by boris becker. Boris has sex with martina and then we see agent smith and his buddys throw 4 guys off a roof and one guy does a few spinning starfish manoeuvres before splatting on the ground. Parkour in russia next because why not. One guy falls and wakes up in the movie Saw only Ryan Reynolds is jigsaw. Not making this up. He was playing a prank though and laughs as parkour kid now has to change his pants. They all now suddenly cant stop saying the word 'snatch' but brad pitt is nowhere in sight. They need to rescue some guy so they all decide to put masks on and throw laughing gas at people because thats the best method apparently. A chinese guy says 'no parrie here' then they shoot him because they wanted a party. Jon Jones covers them with sniper fire but accidentally shoots his own guy but its ok folks because masks can absorb 50 cal bullets. Jon boy now shoots a water tank and everybody goes for a swim, michael phelps would be proud. Parkour kid almost dies but doesnt for some reason. They exchange real names then go to a power genrator and pretend to be english while talking about masturbation. Nope, still not making this up. A revolution starts because of one video which makes big bad guy flee in his range rover and run people down like skittles at a bowling alley. He heads to his yacht but numbered kids were expecting this and begin shooting up the place then magnet boy makes everyone stick to the wall like spiderman. Boom goes the dynamite as part of the yacht explodes, baldy bad boy tries to escape but ryan and his crew miraculously just happen to catch him on the choppa, aaaaoooo. They throw him out and the citizens attack him and probably chop him up into little keepsake pieces. Cue cheesy dialouge about death and living, bla bla bla. Jon jones throws a gun in the ocean and laughs because he's polluted the water and he hates greta thunberg, and then the film ends. No seriously, thats it. What an awesome comedy.",

If you enjoy a thrill a minute ride, Michael Bay style, this is the movie for you. This movie has more blood in it than a Dracula film and revels in it the way the Deadpool movies do.Ryan Reynolds is a billionaire who puts together a team of former operatives from around the world with various talents. Melanie laurent, Manuel Garcia-Rulfo, Ben Hardy, Aria Arjona, Danve Franco and Corey Hawkins make up the rest of the team. They do a really nice job of giving each character dimension and depth that is usually missing from these team up movies. The team all fake their deaths so they can go underground, hence the title. They go after high end criminals with all the glee of a pack of dogs on a three-legged cat, a sort of bada$$ A Team. The profanity flies fast as do the exploding and mutilated body parts. Some of the deaths are over the top and I found myself yelling \"oh\" and then laughing my tail off every time a body was torn to shreds. I found it fascinating how they filmed some of the scenes because they look so darn real.As is typical in these types of movies, the police are nowhere in sight despite these people destroying most of the city with their driving and machine guns. Apparently, the police are social distancing. The plot is kind of weak, but the action is so fast and furious you won't notice it. The banter between the crew is well written and delivered with perfect timing. The film reminded me of Reynolds other films (Deadpool and Hitman's Bodyguard) as well as Shoot 'em Up.Itsa fun two hours as long as you don't try to analyze it too much.",

It has bad-ass, beautiful women toting guns and not afraid to use them. It has lots (and I do mean LOTS) of car chases so that's fun. And just a ton of action going on in general on yachts, with expensive cars and beautiful locales.So all in all, not a bad way to spend an evening watching this movie.

            "content": "Have Netflix lost their moral compass? I wonder. This is a celebration of the extremes in an \"action thriller\" with more innocent victims of collateral damage than there are characters in many films - more violence, more gore and, of course, more action. But then, in its last ten minutes the film crosses a moral line. Although the gore is less in evidence, that's not the issue. Suffice to say that I believe the scene does not belong in a movie targeted at a mainstream audience.So in all honesty I'd recommend skipping this film altogether. But you could get a pretty good flavour for the action and car chase side of things by watching the first twenty minutes - which is basically a homage to The Italian Job... Or you could go on to about forty five minutes in, by which time you'll have seen all the main characters (from several angles), had your righteous indignation stirred and you should be in a position to predict the remainder of the plot with reasonable ease. You may also have noticed the pace of the movie beginning to stutter and the continuity becoming a little disjointed as we wait for the next action sequence.Other reviewers have suggested that it's OK to enjoy the whole film if you maybe disengage your brain first. I'm not so sure that is OK, because some people's brains may not disengage so effectively. The formulaic building of (righteous) indignation is taken as justification for an orgy of grisly revenge - but what if the taste for revenge is not so righteous?The action sequences are good though, and Ryan Reynolds is good. In fact most of the cast throw themselves into the project with gusto. But it's just not quite enough to make up for the downsides.The director here (who I'm not going to name) apparently has a bit of a reputation for this kind of movie. But I'd suggest that it's time his wings should be clipped. Maybe this should be his last of this type. 4/10",

The thing is, you have to have some sort of feasible working plot for us to just sit thru 90 minutes of constant guns and vehicles killing people. Otherwise, it's just a glorified snuff film. This movie starts off with a car chase in Florence and doesn't slow down once.Supposedly the 'plot' is about some billionaire that NOONE has ever heard of (really?) that decides on his own to 'make the world a better place' by killing the bad people. Anyone with half a brain knows the world doesn't work that way. There is ALWAYS someone waiting in the wings that is worse.There was a point in the movie where some sort or organization was mentioned but that was it. The unheard of billionaire supposedly had a whole list of bad guys that he wants to take out but we just saw a single one.I get that there are hard core action fans out there that don't mind plot holes that a Sherman tank could drive thru. I know that if there wasn't a market for these, Michael Bay would be out of a job. It's sad though that there is a market for this because I miss movies with actual believable plots.",

It tries to be subversive yet it's tedious as a social commentary (it doesn't dare to imply that the problem is at home like Fight Club does). It's unfortunate that Ryan Reynold's presence so heavily lends from Deadpool that it quietly threatens to dilute the Deadpool franchise. All the actors were given two dimensional characters with snappy but bland comebacks. It's no where near as bad as Angel has fallen, and not quite as stylised as Baby Driver. but there is something in this choppy, sloppy movie to keep the adrenaline pumped. In the first few minutes where a wing mirror reappears seems to be a little indicator that you have to suspend your disbelief with this movie, I suspect they kept the goof deliberately to give you a heads up; begging you to \"please don't take this seriously\". The movie is not trash; but it's forgettable. In the right mood it's fun, just daft machismo.

Even though I almost liked it, I can definitely see why people hated this movie.The camerawork is very kinetic and frantic. There are some really good shots here and there and it wasn't as shaky as people were making it out to be.The story, shockingly, got me interested. People said that it was stupid, but to be honest, it felt like a good set-up with interesting ideas and routes that it could take. We have a dictator who rules with an iron fist, is a terrorist and uses gas attacks, 7 people who attempt to change all of that, one of which is affected by the dictator's actions, a democratic brother, and a plan to have him replace the dictator. Piece all of that together and we could have gotten an interesting story mixed with realistic action and a pretty stable tone.The action is also really good, despite the absence of logic in some situations. The highlight being the opening car chase, the Hong Kong sequence, and the final fight scene.The CGI is also really well done to the point where at times, I didn't even notice it.The characters are also somewhat interesting, more particularly, 1 (Ryan Reynolds), 2 (The girl from Inglorious Basterds), 4 (Ben Hardy)....actually scratch that. All the character in the main team are interesting. I just wished they had expanded on 2's (The spy), 4's (Parkour guy), 5's (The doctor), and 6's (The Driver) backstories a bit so that they tie into the main situation a bit better.Sadly there is one element that is so bad that it just ruined ALL of the good elements that I had explained above: The Editing. It is all over the place, not only showing a lot of continuity errors, but also ruining the flow of the story, upsetting the pacing, and sometimes even ruining the tone. As such, I felt like the film would have done a lot better if some of the shots were cut out and if the film ran in chronological order.The comedy also felt out of place with some jokes coming after incredibly serious moments.Lastly, I also kind of liked Dave Franco as the Driver so I was shocked and disappointed to see him killed off so early. They could have done more with his character.Overall, this is yet another Michael Bay film with a good premise, a good trailer, and a LOT of promise, that sadly get ruined due to the trashy editing.",

It's an over the top action thriller from Netflix l, starring Ryan Reynolds and written by the guys who wrote Deadpool. Needless to say a lot of this film is heavily influenced by Deadpool, from Ryan Reynolds' dialogue to the structure of the film.6 Underground is not a good film. It makes so many bizarre choices from a writing, acting, directing and editing standpoint that it's really something to behold. And I loved every minute of it! This is Michael Bay fully unleashed in a violent comedy film that doesn't really know what it wants to be.The editing in this film is filled with quick cuts and don't flow together, the cinematography is a combination of close ups (too close for comfort) and Dutch angles. It can be very nauseating, but what do you expect from Michael Bay at this point? Plot, Character and story take a backseat to display insane action and I couldn't get enough of it.This is Michael Bays Best pure action film in a long time. It's technically not a good movie, far from it, but it is absurdly entertaining with insane decisions, writing and story whose structure feels very familiar to Deadpool. It's overall a blast if you want to watch some schlock, but if that's not what you're looking for I can't really recommend.",

            "content": "After more than 20 years in the industry and failing to show one ounce of restraint in his career, it's fair to say we all know what to expect from a Michael Bay movie.Staying true to form, Bay may now find himself away from the big screen and streaming directly into people's living rooms across the world thanks to Netflix but that doesn't mean that his loud, over the top, flaw ridden and daftly fun action thriller 6 Underground skimps on the Bayism's in any way, shape or form.The type of hyper, over-edited and insanely plotted film that gets critics cringing in their seats, Underground is as far away from \"pure\" cinema as you'd ever get but despite all his failings as a director, Bay should be commended for sticking to his guns and if there's one thing Bay is capable of doing, its delivering a turn your brain off fun ride that is often full of set-pieces and show pieces that put many other action films to shame.Kicking off with a seemingly never ending car chase through Florence, that is filled with an abundance of miracle car repairs and continuity errors but also some hold your breath action beats, Underground very quickly showcases to the viewer what they're in for should they stick around and if the extended opening stanza is too much to bare, reach for that off remote as soon as you can, as what is to follow is very much of the same over the top and kinetic nature.In many ways, Underground is one of the most straight up silly and unfiltered features to come out this year, there's no message found lying underneath the surface, no statements being made and no adherence to common decency (just witness the amount of slow-mo deaths or bodies being flung around like no tomorrow); it feels almost as if Bay's effort is from a time warp of body- filled 80's and 90's actioner's that ensured they focused on spectacle first and then if they had time, to anything else in between.Rounding up a decent cast that is headlined by Ryan \"Deadpool persona\" Reynolds as the mysterious billionaire One, Bay decides fairly early on that backstory, character motivations and plot sense will come second to everything else as One and a rag-tag group of partners in crime look to take justice into their own hands as they dispatch \"bad guys\" across the globe.With this mantra in mind, Underground never lets up for a single second as we are whisked to and fro from Hong Kong kidnappings, unnecessary parkour vignettes, Las Vegas assassinations and misuses of magnets and should you be willing to get past the whole daftness of everything you are witnessing, get use to the 40 edits per minute and abundance of lens flair delights, Underground becomes the perfect type of film Netflix need's to support around their increasingly high end dramatic efforts.Final Say -Losing none of his lunatic tendencies, the small screen release of 6 Underground has done nothing to stop Bay's quest to blow up objects, shake his camera and deliver a brainless bouts of fun like only the best of them can. Far from high-class, 6 Underground is exactly what it promises to be should you be willing to go along for the ride.3 swimming pools out of 5",

It's nice to switch up the film to fall asleep to since 90 percent of them Netflix makes are the comedy/teen type.Netflix is very good at making that type of film, that is what the three is for.That and the like-ability (all be it, the same as every film he is in ) of Reynolds.

An absolute mess, which is a shame because there's some good stuff in there, it's just hidden amongst two hours of unwatchable motion sickness.If somebody could remove Bay from the filmmaking process once his directing duties are fulfilled, he could possibly make a decent film or two.I do wonder if anybody's brain operates at a speed capable of processing an action scene in a Michael Bay film in real time? It seems unlikely.\nI will say, I gave it four stars because some of the jokes hit home and I really did like the ship/magnet scenes, very cool idea and almost executed well. Almost.",

I wish that the writer were a little bit more careful with stereotyping in an age of political correctness. Better yet, who not deal with the subject of a real evil, like Boka Haram, as you had shown in bits and pieces rather than simply creating an imaginary evil based on a life-like model? This is lazy writing. Not original in any way whatsoever. Definitely making this as one of worst films of all time.

These people must have relatives in competing movie studios and are only trying to bring down the rating to benefit their second-cousin's first movie out of film school. To Anyone giving this a ONE STAR I give a few alternate suggestions: Howard the Duck, Costner's Robin Hood, Showgirls, Travolta's Battlefield Earth, Ishtar, Cosby's Leonard Pt. 6, Mac and Me, Glitter, Gigli, and Lindsay Lohan in I Know Who Killed Me. Truly, I probably wouldn't give any of even these horrible movies only a ONE as people have gotten at least a 2 or 3's worth of enjoyment poking fun, parodying or marveling at how bad they are over a glass of wine with an equally inebriated friend.If you were able to sit through the entire movie, say \"whoa\" at a stunt driver's prowess at any point or be surprised at the CGI effects of the after-blast of a grenade in mouth death then you can't in any way give this movie a ONE.Stop taking out your Bad Day on a movie that, while it will never get an Oscar nom, at least gave a couple hours of escapist entertainment value. Be FAIR in your review scores as collectively they do add up and can unfairly skew a rating. It was a fun and entertaining movie. Only a Blank Screen deserves a 1-star rating as it indicates that no care was given, performances were phoned in and it was grossly miscast. None of these apply.

has all of that and Some of bay's movies are also horror, slasher thrillers and they both have Michael bayisms in them, violent killing, horrifiing imagery and also blowing stuff up with blood and gore and here it is a mix of them all with the scary gory horror remakes bay did with which he was also a producer of though bay is very famous that almost any movie he is involved with it feels like he also directed it because you can tell it has violent horror killing scenes that are basically like blowing stuff up in action movies but this time it's like that in a horror movie so there you have it a Michael bay movie is both blowing stuff on onscreen with different types of powerfully chaotic explosions \ud83d\udca5\ud83d\udca5\ud83d\udca5\ud83d\udca5\ud83d\udca5\ud83d\udca5 such as with

movies, go Michael bay go you rock, you rule and you are forever awsome and I especially loved the opening scene were Ryan Reynolds and his gang who are a team of vigilante agents who do a mass destruction of solving crimes are in a car chase and I loved the look of the green car they were driving and how they were chasing down their enemies and sometimes even getting chased by enemies and a lot of chaotic action happens such as when a eyeball falls out and blood splashes when some of the members have a blackout from the attack and they all have a great ensemble this is like in the fast and furious movies were a gang tries to stop a crime and fight bad guys and I am a fan of fast and furious movies they were one of my all time guilty pleasures and they all have well shot car chase scenes and action shooting as well as memorable charachters that we all care about and an impressive direction just like most of Michael bay's movies do and here as always Michael bay's direction is impressive he captures it brilliantly and some may say bay's movies can be a guilty pleasure because they have chaotic action that not exactly all critics like but the audiences praises him to death like they cheer for him saying, Michael bay Michael bay Michael bay or just say horray For bayhem and Michael bay is one of the most intensely beloved filmmakers and there was one critic who calls him the most intelligent genius in movie business though I don't remember his name this still shows there are even some critics who like his movies and give them a free pass but to me Michael bay movies are more than a guilty pleasure they are even cinematic masterpieces in making billions of dollars and this is how it is like in our perfect world Michael bay movies make tons of money and are commercial successses and they deserve it and as a matter of fact they deserve to make much more money than he does he should be a billionaire by now just like Spielberg and Lucas it's sad that he isn't but still he is at least close again 6 underground is a good movie and it has everything you need to make a really good action race car chase film that also has a gang heist and a vigilante crime thriller and this terrific crowd pleasing action flick is a combination of all of that , Michael bay also comes across mark neveldine and Bryan Taylor who have made the crank movies which I am not a big fan of because they have inappropriate dialogue but still they try their best even though neveldine and Taylor are very far away from being as good action filmmakers as Michael bay, Michael bay is a very special and unique filmmaker he is as good as everyone says no one can make an action movie as good as Michael bay the only directors who are close to being as good as Michael bay with making an action movie are rob cohen, John woo, John frankenheimer, James Cameron, Steven Spielberg, Peter berg, Peter Jackson and Roland emmerich and this movie proves he can redeem himself if there were movies he has made that were bad like the 5th transformers movie which I thought was so bad it didn't even look like a Michael bay movie and that he left the transformers franchise after dark of the moon because I liked the first three transformers movies and they were the only good transformers movies he made the rest were garbage that not even Michael bay liked doing unlike his other movies that are all good he was proud of them and he always cared for success and giving people what they love This really good action movie is a perfect blockbuster for going straight to Netflix and Michael bay is one of the recent famous directors who have made a straight to Netflix movie like Joel and Ethan Coen with ballad of buster Scruggs or Martin Scorsese for the Irishman which I also thought was a very good movie with great actors and a great cast ensemble and here this is good with being what it is a decent action flick the scenes are shot properly and there is one scene were the whole chase stops when the driver gets impaled by a long needle and later they plan to bury him saying he was a good man the heist team continues their mission by finding the bad president who did bad things to his people who want to get revenge on him they later do many hard work like flood a building or use a magnetic field that movies objects and kills the villains with its flying sharp objects and there is also a scene where Reynolds puts a grenade in someone's mouth and it explodes violently wow this awesome flick is really cool with lots of graphic violence and lots of really good special effects and a decent storyline they all succeed their mission and finally let the president get beaten by the people of his country all the main members of the group have really cool names and are named as numbers this is a really good classic Michael bay movie that improves on his successful career like I said Michael bay received several awards for his films and though this is not one of them and isn't really meant to win any oscars or at least be nominated for special effects still this a good film to just watch while you are eating popcorn \ud83c\udf7f like many of bay's movies they are also popcorn flicks and this is one of them.",

            "content": "Ignore the masses, whining about pointless violence in TV, Movies, and Video Games. They absolutely do NOT have to watch and can STFU.\nMoving Along.\nAside from the gun control nuts, and the movie and TV network clowns, losing money from great films and shows going to companies like Netflix and Hulu, etc etc. And the other aforementioned whiners, I doubt you'll hear too much negative about this film.\nI had a great time watching it last night. Ryan Reynolds was great. Albeit a bit tamer than his Deadpool alter ego, but that is what you get with a non-deadpool movie.What TO expect:\nAn in your face, knocked down, tied behind the vehicle, adrenaline pumping, high octane, mega body dropping, hella good time, with a (mostly) great soundtrack and some good (though, occasionally dated,) laughs. And what I'll say about the dated jokes is this. Do you remember all of those kids movies with all of the adult jokes that the children didn't (and weren't meant to) get and we did? It's kind of like that. If it makes you laugh, great. If it even makes you just roll your eyes before the next explosion and carnage sequence starts, still good. If you don't get it. Oh well, you're probably too young. Or it wasn't meant for you. Oh well, no reason for THAT to equal negative points.What to NOT expect:\n_A. Heavy Character development. Come on, folks. It's an action flick. You want more character development, wait for the sequel, or a series. While SOME action flicks DO have a certain amount of this, it's not generally something there's a whole lot of time for. Were they supposed to hold out in a building during a shootout and have a lengthy chat, get all teary-eyed about their pasts, or cut away from the action for a bit so we could get to know them better, adding another half hour to the movie? No. That would have completely changed the pace of the film. And I don't think it was meant to be that sort of movie. We DID get to know a bit about a few of them. They did all grow closer over the course of the movie. And while making fun of the lack of character development, a lot of sites are poking at what bits there actually were. Imagine if there were more? I could go in depth, but that would require spoilers. I will say that I think they did well while keeping within restraints for time, tone, theme and pacing._B. Sex and Nudity. While there are some things going on, it's mostly kept off screen. A refreshing deviation from 70s/80s violent action and now. I don't know if there'll be an unrated version, but the one I saw kept that part fairly toned down. Unless you're a nun... or some other easily offended person who will flip out over people kissing or making out or scantily clad people. But, then, if that's the case, the violence is probably not for you either._C. Plot? Well, there IS one. I mean, it's pretty much laid out for you in the trailer, but there's a bit more depth to it than that. What more do you need for an action flick? A group of six people, led by a seventh genius, billionaire inventor, - each with various skills- fake their deaths to become an elite team of untraceable ghosts in order to take down the worst of the worst criminals. Evil figures that the world's governments either can't, or won't, touch. That works for me.Summary: To the haters: Stop whining about the violence. If you don't like violence, don't watch violent movies. Let the rest of us have the entertainment WE like and go watch something else.\nIf you LIKE Action films, like any of the acting talent in this film, want to have some fun watching some good mindless action, with minimal plot, explosions, chaos, and a few laughs on top of it all: WATCH this movie.",

            "content": "Whether you like Michael Bay as a film director or not, it goes without saying that he has a very distinct style and never lets audiences deter him from that, which is commendable, even though most of his films are misses. From The Island to Pain and Gain, he has made some films that I quite enjoy, but nothing that was ever thought-provoking or broke new ground. 6 Underground is his latest directorial effort and it's just as grand and bombastic as his most ridiculous films. Although better than where his recent Transformers movies have been, this film isn't nearly as good as some of his best. Here's why this movie has plenty of style, but ultimately feels like a headache.Following six agents who have gone off the grid and call themselves ghosts, form a team to save the world. All having unique skillsets, this film does everything it possibly can to utilize them. When this film first gets started, there's no shortage of action. Stating who these people are, 6 Underground begins with an action sequence that lasts a full 20 minutes. After that, we dive into these characters a little deeper as the film makes you wait for the second half, which is entirely about the set pieces. Although not a great movie by any means, there's no shortage of action for the junkies out there.I feel that this movie found its footing in the second half, but the first half of this movie truly gave me a headache. From the quick cuts to the unnecessary excess of camera angles, this movie feels like too much of everything, all the time. There are even cuts within shots in order to give a kinetic look and feel like the movie is moving at a quicker pace. Although it's a neat style for a music video, that's how this entire movie felt. It really does feel like an over-produced music video with exposition breaks in between the action.As far as the cast goes, Ryan Reynolds is as charismatic as ever and everyone from Corey Hawkins to M\u00e9lanie Laurent delivers some enjoyable performances. The problem is that these characters are spread out in the field too often to really be working together, so there wasn't enough time for chemistry to form between any of them. The action is the only real saving grace here because there are some terrific set-pieces. Although far too frenetic overall, the action is nearly always practical, which was great to see.In the end, 6 Underground is one of Michael Bays weaker movies, which is a shame, because it also features some of his best action in years. I had a blast watching the third act of this movie, but the rest of it just kind of annoyed me. I've been a defender of his recent movies in 13 Hours or Pain and Gain, but this movie just technically missed the mark and the story was far too messy. For those who just want to see some cool action, I can recommend this one, since it's easily accessible on Netflix, but it's really not worth the two hours. Some nice elements aren't enough to save this bombastic piece of Bayhem.",

I know this is all Bay does, but damn, he really outdone himself this time.Nothing happens, nothing changes. I never thought that action scenes can be so exhausting. I genuinely felt tired. You can't have scenes that are not connected to anything. I appreciate some of the stunts and the action scenes but there need to be a movie behind those scenes. What is the point of disconnected action set pieces? What is the point of all this if there are no characters, no motivations, no real danger, nothing. It's like a 2hr video game cut-scene but worse.The dialogue is mostly bad jokes, memes and random movie quotes.Ryan Reynolds is playing Ryan Reynolds, as always. I mean, at least he's having fun...This would've been passable considering Bay's involvement, but this drags for 2 hours and there is nothing to grab onto. I mean, I can enjoy Bad Boys, I can enjoy Armageddon, I LOVE The Rock for what it is, but this is too much.Michael Bay has achieved the impossible, he made an action film that is such a bore I barely finished it.",

As for the women, what and who, is classic Bay, no actual need other than eye candy so all you think is why.\nSo as for storyline, hmmmm, so 'GHOSTS' go around killing bad people with answering to nobody. They achieve this by people believing that they are dead and therefore off the grid. So they drive around in a dayglow green car, have their photo's taken by a reporter etc. After 40 mins in basically nothing has happened and that's how it goes.\nSo apart from terrible acting, script, cinematography and more assistant directors you have ever heard of, 22 at last count (I kid you not) what do you get?

We've already seen such mess in Savage (2012), The Fast and The Furious franchise, Taxi 1-4 franchise made by the French, Dobermann (1997), on and on, I can name a few more. But none of them was as messy and boring like what I just watched in the runaway-train like long and boring car chase of 6 Underground (2019). When the chase ended miraculously, the survivors sat on the deck of a boat, I have already lost the appetite to watch it. MY eyes and brain were both spin and felt dizzy. The crazy screenplay, the directing, the editing, the acting of all the involved, are just mindless and meaningless. This movie is one of the messiest ones I've ever encountered.",

It just gets to the point where it feels like everything is made of lighter fluid; just a little spark in this movie will cause an over the top, Hollywood explosion. Michael Bay is known for this style of filmmaking, so I just can't constantly flame him for his directing choices. Aside from its comedic directing, 6 Underground has a lot of issues in the writing department.I said to myself during the movie \"This is just Ryan Reynolds being a mortal Deadpool\", and after looking up the writers (Paul Wernick and Rhett Reese), I found out that both wrote the Deadpool movies. The dialogue was really off-putting, it's a thriller movie, but nobody takes it serious. The comedic, Deadpool-like dialogue ruined the intensity in so many scenes. I don't know if 6 Underground is supposed to be a comedy, because usually in comedies, there's visual humor and entire scenes dedicated to one joke, but 6 Underground has none of those qualities. And the writers are really talented too, I enjoyed a lot of their movies, but this wasn't it.6 Underground also played it very safe. Really, the only interesting thing that was introduced was how the characters are supposed to be dead. 6 Underground is just very average with its plot, you know, saving the world from evil people/world leaders; I've seen this plot been done a dozen times better. And there is a self awareness in this film, which I do appreciate. The entire cast knows that they're making a dumpster fire, so at least there's that.Overall, 6 Underground is just another mediocre action flick. It plays everything very safely without any innovation. And I do realize that 6 Underground isn't supposed to be getting any Oscars, but today, I guess I just feel critical.",

I of course understand this movie attempts to be more like a modern day Batman with a larger team, but is it too much to ask for a movie of this nature to be coherent?On the plus side, Ryan Reynolds commits and like always, does a good job of acting.

Wasting 150m$ and came up with this brainless mess?\nThink about it: 150m$ could do so many more meaningful, more humanitarian works, even help building part of the border wall and shake the hand of the lunatic. But Netflix never did things like this, they just hired a guy to direct a motion picture with so many superhero-like cartoon characters and more money in special effect, gunpowder and explosive, cars, and compensations caused by making this pathetic mess. Do we really need Ryan Reynolds to play this billionaire role? Any actor with better voice quality would be and could be a better choice. Jesus, his voice still sounded like a under-developed teenager, so thin and so....like your grasp a guy's throat, the voice coming out of that strained throat would just like the voice coming out of Ryan Reynolds' throat. I can't believe a guy at 43 years old, his voice never changed a bit, just like what we heard in his \"Van Wilder: Party Liaison (2002)\", still sounded like a Spring Chicken. I heard this actor has become a second copy of Edward Norton, so obnoxiously arrogant that the director of the \"Deadpool\" 2 or 3, just quit due to this actor's bad attitude. But what I've seen about this guy is a under-developed 2 dimensional B-level 2nd tier actor, his acting in many movies were almost the same, superfluous and shallow, just skin-deep and never showed us some in-depth performances. He's always like the typical branded Ryan Reynolds in almost every movie he signed up. He got a costume and mask in Deadpool to cover up his whole being, but the voice is still as thin as a teenager. Leonardo DiCaprio used to have the same light-wt. thin voice, but I did find his voice finally well-developed to match his age, but RR guy seems to have his voice frozen in time, such a weird voice out of the mouth of 6'2\" 43 years old guy is just weird. No matter what role he played, his voice simply made the character he played unrealistic with a comic effect. What a weird hot commodity from Canada.Paul Wernick, Rhett Reese, the two writers who scripted this messy movie, actually wrote a script? It seems that there's no screenplay at all, every scene was developed under one scene finished and made up right away afterwards. A new kind verbal script without any word on paper?Michael Bay, I strongly suggest you better change your present \"Director\" title and start your video game company or hook up with Disney for some new genre violent cartoons, you might find the new career is what you are really born-to-be. Just give up this \"Director\" job, will you? Because you're killing it.",

But, once you catch on, remember it's directed by Michael Bay and stars Ryan Reynolds. Then just sit back and enjoy the ride! There was an inconceivable amount of \"collateral damage\" and the action was way, WAY over the top. I loved Reynold's deadpan humor and the interaction between the main characters will seem forced, at first. You just have to go with it...you'll be glad you did. There will be a sequel for sure and there's talk of a \"6 Underground\" franchise!\nAll in all, this movie is Bay at his best and Ryan Reynolds is the cherry on top...ENJOY!",

The opening must be similar what an epileptic feels when looking into a strobe light. It was immediately obvious this was a mega budget flick. Only found out how much (O.M.F.G. are you serious?) after I'd decided to drop my 2c. This movie did one this tremendously well : it left me with the the most enormous - WHY?.\nWhy squander so much potential (and money)?\nWhy so much unnecessary, dare I say neurotic editing ?\nWhy do \"Tarentino\" type violence and death so badly ?\nWhy would anyone approve such a weak plot ?\nWhy so much utterly pointless urban running ?\nWhy try to nod and wink at so many \"cult\" movies and movie makers and botch every attempt.?\nWhy , Why, Why ?? I could go on . Sure, its an endless roller-coaster of \"fun\", ahum ...., some fatalistically filmed scenes and gorgeous locations and great looking actors.\nI'm sure that someone in gazillionare movie land asked many of the same questions upon completion.\nReal movies lovers will find this a frustrating, disappointing and anticlimactic screen splurge.",

The narrative is sometimes chaotic, but I didn't expect Shakespeare and the storyline isn't exactly rocket science. The acting is good, there's that Reynolds touch of humour and some of the action scenes surpass the level of Fast and Furious and Bond-movies alike IMO. Bay's tendency to go overboard on strobe-like filming would be my only issue with this film, which overall by far exceeded my expectations.

A lot of these people who flood these review boards with nonsensical BS come across as if they failed outta college & now wanna try their hand at becoming ace film critics. So they go way over the top over-analyzing every film & literally dissect them scene by scene. If they don't have the backstory to every single character or have to use their own imaginations at certain points, we have to hear about plot hole galore. Obv films have them & sometimes they do take away from a film. Usually it's only a minor detraction but they act like well, guess I'm gonna dock the film 9 pts & give it a 1. Then either with same movie they'll complain about a movie not being realistic enough as if they can't wrap their head around fiction & fact it's a MOVIE!These kind of movies are pretty straight forward. Whether it's the A-team, the losers, or fast & the furious franchise which surprisingly some people will say things like, the first was good and then it just went down hill for most part. Maybe it's just that they are all good just some are better. But some people wanna just hate on sequels to franchises or they wanna hate in general. It's usually wanting to hate or wanting to try & look smart by concocting some over the top review for a simple action film or pick a genre. Some genres like comedy, horror & action are usually pretty straight forward aside from outliers. Why do some people feel like they are entitled to an absolute Oscar worthy film every movie they turn on or else it sux. My god is that annoying.We can all have opinions. Don't all have to agree to a movies exact rating. But it's clear some people either just wanna be trolls or they think they are on another intellectual level the rest of us cannot understand & they feel the need to show us the depths of their genius. So they dissect a simple film to the point it's all torn apart when all the film was really there for was to provide some quality entertainment for an hour plus.Are we a people losing the ability to just enjoy a regular average movie these days with out saying it sucks. I'm not saying everyone has to think it's great but to watch this movie & come away complaining or acting like it's a hot mess, my God examine your life....hard!",

On the first day, the mother got everything out, put paper on the floor to prevent spills and sat in the room with them while they painted. She was amazed at how well they painted and how smoothly everything went. So on the next day, the mother set everything up, got them started, but decided to go and do some other things while they were painting. When she came back just a few minutes later to check on them, it was complete chaos in the room; paint was all over the walls, in their hair, all over the table and on the carpet. Even the dog got some paint on him. The mother laughed while telling the story and she ended it by saying \"even though it was a mess and didn't make any sense, there was still something beautiful with what they created\". I tell you this story to say that in this parable, Michael Bay is the pre-school age little girl, the mother leaving them unattended is Netflix and the nonsensical, yet somewhat beautiful result is 6 UNDERGROUND.",

However, if you can subdue your logic thinking ability, you will have a lot of fun with this film. Just don't take it too seriously.'6 Underground' blends so many genres into one film, so much so that the dramatic - and emotional - moments are not really taken seriously due to the constant humor. Rather view it as an action comedy and you will be satisfied. The action sequences are incredible. The stunning visuals and photography are unique and I'd probably watch this just for these action scenes - and the awesome soundtrack! Every frame is beautifully shot. Fresh from the latest 'Transformers' series entry, director Michael Bay is once again pushing action to the limits, with incredible stunt work. From a collapsing swimming pool on top of a 90-story building to magnetizing an entire yacht, the film offers scenes we've never seen before. The future of action movies has arrived.The film suffers from numerous inconsistencies and lack of character background and development, but as I said, if you don't take it seriously, this is one hell of an action packed thrill ride!",

Car chases, explosions, shootouts, a lot of loud noises, nice scenery in foreign countries, beautiful clothing, attractive women. The plot is quite confusing, with distracting editing, jump scenes from different timelines. As it felt like a mess at times. We barely get to know about much of the characters and the main reason for all its occurrence. Perhaps the writing could have been stronger.The opening 25 minutes or so are intriguing then it somewhat drags on after that. It does get better towards the end but overall, this film is quite underwhelming as a whole.The violence is slick and stylish and reminds of \"Wanted\" or \"Shoot Em' Up\". There are some decent amounts or entertainment mainly due to the strong violence, several quality chase scenes and sone solid shoot outs. Though the film doesn't quite live up to its hype.

Striking any sort of rational intelligence grazingly, this Bay opus is his typical bag (sexy women, violence ad nauseum, car chases done on an Indy 500 budget) which hopes to fray nerves but merely gave my eyeballs a workout whenever they rolled back inside my head. He definitely has talent (13 Hours/Pain & Gain) but his preponderance to make a film aimed at the lowest common denominator is ultimately heartbreaking.

The theme of the movie is there is a lot of evil in the world, how extreme would you go to change things? A pack of highly trained soldier type people take matters into their own hands after erasing themselves from the lives they once knew and are now freed to fulfill their passion of ending tyranny around the globe. The main story is some Middle East dictator is oppressing his people. I forgot the country which is unimportant as maximizing action is the goal of this shoot 'em up. The movie kicks off with an outstanding long opening action scene with entertaining car chases mixed with immature and irreverent humor compared with the professional seriousness of Ronin for example. Later it turns into the current modern action movie template for high energy, over the top, brutal gun and explosion bloodbath. They do poke fun at themselves and at least know their place.

The camera can't keep still or focused on anything for a few seconds. The story chops all over the place with so much frequency and unpredictability it's like having an entire movie described to you by a 7 year old who tells you the 'cool' bits then remembers about plot, another cool bit, oh some characters and if you ask, maybe some more plot. If you've never had that experience then watch this and...no actually just don't watch this full stop.Ryan Reynolds plays Ryan Reynolds and he probably could have saved this badly stitched collection of clips had he be on screen for longer than 9 seconds and allowed to say more than 3 sentences together. Ryan Reynolds often sites Green Lantern as the worst movie he ever made, well he can definitely now start siting this diabolical mess instead. And if you want to watch the movie simply \"because Ryan Reynolds\" then you're better off just sitting through Green Lantern (again).Avoid, avoid, avoid. No wonder it didn't go to cinema.

I could sense it just from the feel and pace of this movie and not even Ryan Reynolds charm could elevate this movie above a cliche. The supporting cast isn't very convincing imo and the story more manufactured to bring all these big names together for a project Netflix decided to throw money at.

There were a few likable people in this film, and cast giving good engaging performances.But balance that against the the director, with a track record of meaningless bombast, and a weird and problematic story.They obviously wanted to do a heroes save the world from baddies narrative, and recognised that they could not use the US military as those said heroes, not with their current track record of corruption and evil (collateral damage etc) so they invent an independent crew of mostly American rogue operators roaming the world overturning regimes they decide they don't like.It was really dicey ground in the current climate and I'm not saying it wasn't entertaining in places but some of it was way off.It was deep in the concept of cartoon baddies that can be slaughtered wholesale, brutally and violently, not to mention graphically, all with a cheeky wink. Taken scene by scene with Ryan's witty quips it didn't seem so bad but as an over all arch, it's jut kinda uncomfortable to be served this as a plateful of entertainment.I just don't think this works any more and it getting dumped as a franchise for possible sequels probably indicates that higher up powers also think that.It was impressively crafted on a notably big scale, by people who know what they're doing technically, but a lot of huff and puff for no valid end.",

            "content": "Yes, Michael Bay is the most hated director ever. But is he the worst director of all-time ? I would put that category to David O. Russell, Brett Ratner, Uwe Boll instead. Michael Bay may not be the greatest movie director ever, but 75% of his movies are mindless entertaining and worth your times to spent.With the latest release of his new movie, I would be confessing that I did not know what to expect to this one. It's a 150$ millions budget Netflix movie that exclusively show at the Netflix, so I really don't know how it's going to be but I hope it's good enough as a Netflix movie.Turned out, this movie is beyond my expectation and it's the biggest comeback ever for Michael Bay that put a lot of his effort into this movie.I dare to says, Underground 6 is the best Michael Bay movie of all-time. Armageddon used to be my fav of his for a long time and it dethroned by this movie, sorry and not sorry, I think it's way better than 1996's The Rock that a lot of people claimed it as his best film ever but that movie doesn't hold up anymore compare to a good plot and interesting storytelling structure that 6 Underground had. Also, this one is more satisfying than Bad Boys 2.Surprisingly, the script of Paul Wernick + Rhett Reese (Deadpool) really match to Bayhem's direction, this is the main reason why Underground 6 succeed where no Michael Bay movies had done before, it knows what it try to be and so very good in both action and comedy that really delivered ! This is a movie was born for Ryan Reynolds to played, once again, his performance own the whole movie and the cast had a lot of chemistry.This is like Fast Five + M:I - Ghost Protocols + The A-Team + The Thomas Crown Affair + G.I. Joe + Grand Theft Auto that match up into one awesome movie, and this could be the new mega action franchise for Michael Bay that will compete to Die Hard + John Wick.Also, this is the perfection action movie of the year that blew the disappointing overrated John Wick 3 out of the water and way more satisfying into the max.Anyway, haters gonna hate it anyway, Because Underground 6 is effing AWESOME and it deserving to releasing in Cinemas too.",

But the action was fantastic really fantastic. This is one of the best action movies if EVER seen, and if seen alot. The most badass thing was the beat of the music in every action scene. And the 2.8 hours flying cars over you screen.Overall watch this movie with a bag of chips \u00e1 beer and a really big bag of SALT. Just enjoy the movie.",

            "content": "After watching the trailer and hearing hot Adria Arjona shout \"Puppies!\" I was sold. Of course that was not the only reason; there's Ryan Reynolds' scamp humour, M\u00e9lanie Laurent's intense everything, Manuel Garcia-Rulfo's fatalistic (pun intended) charm and of course Michael Bay's wherewithal for this project.If you read the IMDb synopsis it's not enough; you also need to read the IMDb Storyline further down that page, then, here, I add my observations. The group of six hyper-Equalizer characters set out to remove the despicable dictator of a fictitious country, loosely based on Bashar al-Assad, as best as I can determine. The leader of the hero-pack, Reynolds, while on a mission to help the refugee children from that fictitious country, experiences first hand the cruelty of the dictator, and as he leaves the camp with a victim child in his arm, becomes resolute to stop the despot's reign of terror. Background on Reynolds' character: he is a genius inventor, filthy rich but for the most part unknown to the world, he fakes his tragic death to become a ghost, free to do what ghosts can do, haunt people.Of course the \"6\" all have skillsets and all share the same objective; so, as you can expect, lots of pawns of the dictator, generals and security folks, get neutralized, killed, in the process. The toys, that's movie talk for weapons, the \"6\" use are special and how they go about delivering the dictator's brother in exile (because he was the good brother) provides plenty of action and great special effects. The \"6\" intend to replace the dictator with his good guy brother. Then we get more, a lot more, action from \"6\" as they proceed with the dictator's removal. Chaotic revolution sparked by the \"6\" in the process.Since I'm on a roll with the spoilers in this review, I'll just add that they are successful with the kidnaping of course, not the assassination; no, the \"6\" instead deliver the corrupt leader to the refugee camp where his welcome is not the kind you'd call warm.If you like Michael Bay movies and series, you'll love this movie. It was a lot of fun for me.",

I was expecting car chasings, shootings, explosions in Michael Bay style, and this is what I got. I was actually very surprised about parkour scenes, that were a nice addition to the whole package. Cast was... good, but these movies unfortunately does not let actors to express their true acting skills. Technically speaking is very well made. The opening sequence in Italy is amazing and actually I rewatched a couple more time, only this a couple of time.

For a theatrical release this is a simple matter of revenue versus budget, if revenue is higher than budget the movie was a success and visa versa. For a straight to Netflix release the success or failure is more difficult to judge. The most obvious metric would be how many people watched the movie, but that is no reflection of quality. People will watch it because in their perception it is free, but if they had to pay to watch how many would do so? If a traditional movie studio produced expensive dros like 6Underground they would go out of business pretty quickly so they would ensure production quality to avoid bankruptcy. It's different for Netflix however. They can continue to produce garbage like this movie and people will watch it because it is free so there is no incentive to produce quality products.",

How it got through quality control is surprising but maybe that's it - spot the goofs.What really got me was the endless product placement - Heineken beer, Alfa-Romeo cars for example. I also noticed Aviation Gin (Reynolds has an ongoing interest in promoting that drink).It's all noise and action at the expense of any real depth of story. Oh sorry, there is no story.

The opening chase scene has ridiculous edits that have cars magically appearing and disappearing over and over again. There are mindless stunts that are just an excuse for CGI work.

            "content": "The Netflix movie 6 Underground is about an independent/off-the-radar task force trying to topple a dictator. Though light on substance, this turned out to be a crazily entertaining film.If you've seen Michael Bay's Bad Boys movies, you know the director has no qualms about violence, but here he kicks it up to another level. Everything is up at11 out of 10 in this, and Bay makes the most of the R rating. There are some innovative action ideas in this. The movie also looks great. Overall, this is one of those Bay films where he leans into his best qualities and mostly avoids his worse. It doesn't hurt that this is written by Deadpool and Zombieland writers Rett Rheese and Paul Wernick.Also being a Bay film, the plot isn't as strong as the action. It's pretty hard to believe the characters are able to stay off-the-grid as many of them exercise very little discretion throughout the film. Still, the plot is decent, not to mention the characters and villain. Admittedly the movie does lean into the character of Three (Manuel Garcia-Rulfo) either making too many jokes or stupid decisions. Still, he does have his moments.I went into this without a lot of expectations and was surprised. Recommended.",

The movie is Mission Impossible, Expendables with Deadpool comedy and Guy Ritchie's frentic camera shots.

            "content": "With this film we have probably Michael Bay's masterpiece. The whole of his art of the short musical film (the music video, of which he was an artisan) is fully expressed. The hysteria, the baroque, the furious, the misogyny, the violence, the vulgarity, the clich\u00e9s, the blood, the self-indulgent display, and any visual element whose intensity produces a great sensation on the observer, are exploited to produce a masterpiece of the genre, from the first minutes. As such, the first twenty minutes are a symphony of destruction through CGI porn in the beautiful city of Florence, where its settings are exploited. This sequence constitutes a video-clip of about fifteen minutes with moments of tension, humor, drama, violence, blood and gore; a beginning of anthology that constitutes a self-contained short film (this is a good part of the exposition of the six agent characters subterranean title). We'd be curious to know the respective contributions of the three credited editors, each a veteran of editing.Then the film goes more into a flat scenario with explanations about the birth of the team, how it was formed, the background and the career of its members, causing a slowdown. Because it takes the time to give a little flesh, substance and even a story to the members of the underground team. Then it starts again until the sequences of the end. Clearly it is the boss of a film from the Mission: Impossible franchise that is used or mocked (because here is shown what we never see in Bruce Geller's film franchise), but with humor, excess, blood, sex, in short not for all audiences. That's the advantage of Netflix streaming.We are not interested in the villain and the associated plot (like a James Bond or a Mission: Impossible). But we are waiting for the action sequences, crumpled metal sheets, explosions, brutality, which follow and as such the film is a little unbalanced by its first introductory sequence, but makes up for it with some unseen spectacular (the whole part on the boat).The film gives an old-fashioned look to the franchises with crumpled metal sheets and explosions (James Bond, Fast & Furious, Mission: Impossible) thanks to its excesses.

Their first mission: deposing the vicious dictator of Turgistan and replacing him with his more peaceful brother (Payman Maadi).\nIt's become common for directors who have made a movie with Netflix to wax lyrical about the near total freedom that's given to them. While that autonomy can mean we get films like The Irishman from Martin Scorsese, it can also lead to films like Michael Bay's 6 Underground which, with a rumoured budget of $150 million, is on a par with 2017's Netflix tentpole Bright. The latter defied the negative reviews and became a massive hit, and the streaming giant will be hoping that their latest expensive gamble pulls off something similar. For this is Bayhem in its purest form, and that's for the worse instead of the better.\nThe mercs against the world plot (such as there is one), which is explained over and over and over again despite a lengthy opening car-chase sequence and flashbacks designed to catch us up, is laden with potential. If this were a better movie you could easily see it being the start of a franchise, but the problems start early and pile up almost as quickly as the John Wick-esque body count.\nThis is Michael Bay at his most irresponsible and gory.There's something to be said for the fact that Bay is such a distinctive auteur that you need only watch the first five minutes of 6 Underground - which has some impressive vehicular moments to boot - to know exactly who's behind the camera. It's just frustrating that that unique visual style goes hand in hand with other elements that are now part and parcel of the Bay experience. From the incoherent editing to the objectification of women to the over-excessive and nasty violence, which is at times perpetrated by the characters we're meant to be rooting for, this is Bay at his most irresponsible and gory.As for the people in front of the camera, it should be no surprise that Reynolds - who is working from a screenplay penned by Deadpool writers Rhett Reese and Paul Wernick - gets all the best lines, and he remains fun to watch even though we don't learn much about his character as the movie progresses. The rest of One's team fare less well, falling somewhere between the bare minimum of characterisation and, in the case of Adria Arjona's 'Five', absolutely nothing at all. Thankfully, Corey Hawkins infuses his sniper with decency that the movie sorely needs, and M\u00e9lanie Laurent seems to know exactly what movie she's in and acts accordingly.\nUltimately, though, 6 Underground will have you asking a ton of questions about many of its bizarre choices, including but not limited to: Why replace the driver on your team with a sniper? Why are the team taking orders from the billionaire even though he's clearly the worst leader of all time? The film is less concerned with answering these than it is in plunging you into the next heavily stylised action sequence. Such is the Bay way.",

            "content": "Our film follows six rogue agents who have all faked their own deaths and have become 'Ghosts'. Each member of the team has no name, only a number (from 1 - 6). The leader of the group calls himself \"One\" (played by Ryan Reynolds) and is a mysterious millionaire who decides when enough is enough from bad guys around the globe. When the government can't do anything, the team of 6 will complete the task instead. 6 Underground shows the audience a random mission that has been selected by \"One\" (Ryan Reynolds). Along the way the film will also give flashbacks and insights about each team member, including how they all met as well as how they were discovered and invited into the elite team.For those who are not aware, this film has been directed and produced by Michael Bay (Best known for his other directional film \"The Rock\", \"Transformers\" & \"Bad Boys\"). The first thing that stands out about 6 Underground is the Michael Bay style which is fairly consistent in the majority of his films. You know what I mean, right? This film is loaded with big explosions, cars flipping in the air, lots of gun fire, airplanes flying and random humour which doesn't always land a solid laugh. Most importantly, every Michael Bay film has solid amounts of product placement, including the lead actor's very own product of \"Aviation Gin\" (Yes Ryan Reynolds, I did notice it clearly).For some viewers this type of film is exciting and great to play loudly on your home theatre system. For others, this type of film can be pointless. I personally don't have an issue with the film's style and let face it, sometimes you just just feel like watching a brainlessly entertaining film. After all, one of my all time favourite Michael Bay films to this day is \"The Rock\" (1996).But for me, I did notice a couple of issues that are deeply concerning.The film feels absolutely loaded with content when the reality is it's just a story about a single mission. But because the film begins with no history or back story of it's leading characters, the film tries to develop the characters later in the 1st act of the film. The point in the film where the backstories begin to be introduced feels a little out of place. Honestly I found some stories confusing as to which character it was about. You see, with this type of film, everything is happening extremely quickly which brings me to my second point and something I had a really big issue with- the editing.The editing style of this film is choppy with really fast edit cuts and for me personally, I found many edits cuts in this film seemed out of place, particularly when all 6 team members have all split up and are trying to sneak around and complete an objective. I found myself questioning many times during these edits, \"What happened to that person?\" or \"hang on, how did that happen?\" and the list goes on. About halfway through the film I personally accepted the fact that the film has lots of gaps in the story and I had to deal with it.On a positive note, the film's visuals and even its audio track was possibly one of the best I have seen on Netflix in some time (I suggest we thank Michael Bay for that praise point).As for our leading man, yes, we do have some minor jokes here and there which managed to secure a laugh from me. But in regards to the action done by the leading man, actor Ryan Reynolds actually doesn't do much which was slightly surprising to me considering the man's talent and resume in action films.Overall, while 6 Underground displays amazing visuals and audio tracks which is possibly the best I've seen from Netflix in some time (thanks to director Michael Bay!) the film's plot and editing is messy. Even though it seems like the plot should be simple enough as it is a good guys vs bad guys premise, the film also has multiple back stories which are shown far too late in the film. These backstories are trying to give the audience a reason to care but instead they hurt the film. A bigger issue was the film's editing and cuts which made the film feel very choppy throughout. Thankfully, movie lovers who are simply seeking just another over the top action film in \"Michael Bay style\" will generally be pleased by the crazy action sequences, particularly in the film's opening act alone.4.8/10\nWalkden Entertainment",

The dialogue was forced, childish and with no weight or grit.The storyline was convoluted, mashed mess with no sign of a coherent plot until about 40 mins in. Even Ryan Reynolds star power couldn't salvage this mind numbing trash, he is mostly in the film however does nothing but complain the entire time, probably due to the mess that it was. And by the end of the film it looks like he is filming a cologne advert, not great at all. However give it a go it won't cost you anything other than your time, each to there own.",

Legs and wheels and guns and bombs and crashes and explosions. A multiple orgasm of explosions. But here's the sweet part of the deal: it has Ryan Reynolds. And Ryan Reynolds is allowed to, nay, implored to, quip sarcastic for the duration. Much like his \"Deadpool\" persona, except without the super hero crap. This is the saving grace. Or at least, makes it a bearable couple hours of parkour crazy, escapism fluff. \"6 Underground\" is a really great bad film. There, it had to be said.Of course there's problems a plenty, like some ill advised political interludes, but that's what the fast forward button is for. And if grandpa has fallen asleep on the remote, you can take the time to restock nourishment, which is absolutely necessary. This is a giant tub of popcorn and a supersized vat of soda movie.The plot, such as it is, involves a planned private coup of the oppressed nation of Turgistan, which turns out to be a fictional place (thanks Google Maps). It is also the set up for a tiny but oh so delicious Bern of the unnamed American president: \"he can't even spell it\". This thing is littered with little Reynolds verbal snipes which come almost as fast as the bullets. Pay attention. Or don't.Everything looks super fantastic, all flashy colours, GoPro angles, boytoy guns and sculpted cleavage. There's slimy bad guys and chiselled good guys, and absolutely no grey areas in between. The storyline is grade school ridiculous, but also, grade school fabulous. As if a Ritalin and energy drink hopped up nine year old, mish-mashed the action sequences in every Bond, Mission Impossible, and Fast and Furious franchise on his laptop. If there's a level above \"over the top\", this is it. Magnificently insane. Sure to sweep the bestest and mostest explosions categories at the next Oscars. It is that good.Or maybe it's the fever talking. Whatever, this is a cerebral jolt of incoherent, lunatic action fun that hits the spot. Just pummels it.hipCRANK",

            "content": "\"6 Underground\" is everything people love and hate about Michael Bay, plus the charisma and charm of Ryan Reynolds. Chaotic hyper-violence complimented by frenetic editing, it's everything Michael Bay has become known for, for better or worse. I enjoyed it, might even say I loved it. It's like staring at a plate of cocaine.Michael Bay has built quite a reputation for himself, one that anyone reading this or considering watching this movie probably is familiar with. Well, as you've probably read everywhere else, this film has Bay all over it. All his trademarks are there. It's overblown, it's violent, it's profane, and it is very fun. It's very akin to an \"Expendables\" or \"Fast & Furious\" movie, as its themes deal with family and its importance, to go along with the themes of terrorism and violence.\"6 Underground\" was made to be enjoyed in context. It's a straight-forward action thriller that doesn't let up. Michael Bay is catering to his fans here, and in no way trying to reach any other demographics, except for the Ryan Reynolds fans. Reynolds' charm and charisma are definitely on display here, and as you might expect, he plays himself (which is why we love him).The action here is on par with Bay's other works. It may not be his greatest film, but I'd put it in the neighborhood. There are basically three very long action sequences, with some minor acts of violence in between. That may sound disappointing, but it's really not. The opening car chase is practically 20 minutes long, the penthouse shootout/flood/parkour chase was equally as long and crazy, and the final battle aboard the yacht was about 30 minutes long and totally insane. There's enough nasty violence and jarring, bone-crunching action to satisfy, so don't worry.My only problems with the movie were Bay's trademarks, as it turns out. I expected a bare-bones, no-frills story and lots of action, and I got it. I understand Bay's necessity to include nasty violence, as it is an action movie, and although the violence was pretty sadistic and unnecessary at times, I could handle it. But it's his inability to restrain himself in other areas that annoys me. There's way too much profanity here, and I get that Ryan Reynolds loves him some f-word, but come on. And then there were like, three sex scenes (no nudity) that were super unnecessary. The women in this film need to show their strength and empowerment by mercilessly blowing away bad guys in one scene, but are then fine with being completely objectified in different lingerie the next. I'm surprised that this stuff is so prevalent in our overly-PC culture, but our culture is also sex-crazed, so where does that leave us? At Michael Bay's 15 year-old hormonal and classless fantasies, apparently.It's great if you set your expectations from the \"logical and rational\" setting to the \"Michael Bay\" setting. This movie is very overblown, and that's coming from someone who's practically a fan of his (he won me over with the \"Bad Boys\" movies). Try it out, without the kids obviously, and give it a chance.",

But the senseless violence, including a poison gas attack on a village left me shaking my head. A terrible movie.",

My only criticism would be the odd mistake of the car not being scratched when it should be etc. Besides that I would also say the explosions were a bit over used. That's the only things that stopped it being a 10. Overall the movie is a must watch and one that I have already watched 3 times in one week.

The concept of \"Talented band of misfits take down villains,\" is classic fun and always a crowd-pleaser, if done well.Unfortunately, this movie is not done especially well. The plot isn't cohesive. There's scene. Scene. Another scene. They don't necessarily fit together. It suffers from too many trite, sarcastic lines. Less would have been more.The best comedians opine once they've made intelligent observation, whether they're your CupO'T or not. Disrespectful snark has its place, especially against condescending snobbery, but it only improves the presentation if used sparingly, like truffle oil in a sauce. At this point, however, that trope is now tiresome. So played out, yo. If one pauses to reflect on Hollywood's penchant for toileted up junior-highish, *Dumbed-Down* content, it isn't funny at all.====> rant ===> optional reading ===>\nTalk about this crisis, and that crisis: We're in a crisis of disrespect. How many of our crisies would be ameliorated if people started to be decently respectful? Btw, it's easy with friends. The challenge is to disrespectfully disagree with all shades of other human beings. If you feel compelled to sling personal insults and mock others, your are simply a toddler. Hollywood has encouraged a contemptuous and babyish culture, that blindly believes everything they FEEL is more important than facts. By this time, y'all are too much like country-clubified, pearl-clutching old bitties.At the same time, all media (I'm now bringing video games into the woodshed) has encouraged these toddlers to work out their angst with violence and zero regard for life. Sounds awfully disrespectful, right? The specious mantra always is: 'It's of no consequence. People know the difference between real life and fantasy.' Well, isn't that a sweeping statement and over simplification. Can we at least stipulate that the stats in reference to violence and moral decline in our society are a complex issue with a lot of subtleties?In the history of screen entertainment, most action/war films are fine to amazing, though in a long skid, thanks to Mr. Bay and the like. However, there is absolutely zero doubt that saturation of violent content peels many off the edges, degrading their sense of right and empathy. Entertainment doesn't get all the blame; they don't get most of the blame either. But gratuitous disrespect as well as meaningless violence are a corner puzzle piece.=========~> end rant <~=========On the bright side, the weapon they pulled out on the yacht (controlled by the phone) was so cool. The rating went up a point just for that.While the flick has its moments, it ultimately falls flat under the shallow, dumbed-down directing which is, sadly, typical of Mr. Bay. Too much of what Hollywood, in general, puts out is downright insulting. It's the cinematic equivalent of junk food.Take a break once in a while and cleanse the pallet with some of the fabulous foreign cinema and shows that Netflix and Prime have available. That way you can stretch your brain a little to recover from the brain shrinking that movies like this cause, at least, that's what I did!IMHO...\n\ud83c\udfac6 \ud83e\udd142 \ud83c\udfad6 \u26a18\nSuggested Age 15& up.",

The narrative is completely incoherent and just serves as a way for Michael Bay to 69 you with explosions and stupidly impossible stunts for two hours. It's practically sinful as a genuine film, but if you're looking for something to watch with friends so you can laugh at it or get drunk and laugh harder, then I guess it's a good recommendation.

In the country where I live, the police are instructed to stop pursuing criminals if the pursuit is likely to cause damage to others. This moral aspect seems to have been forgotten/not even thought of in this movie.And as I believe it even was pointed out in the movie, where did all the bad guys come from in the opening sequence of the movie? How on earth could they be that coordinated on so short notice/without any warning in forehand??? And as others have pointed out: Who on earth would pick a car that was THIS easy to pick out in a crowd as a getaway car in the opening sequence???Visually the fighting sequence at the end looked great. But technically it was just Sci-Fi, and not even credible. The things that happens between the beginning and the end was not much memorable, and messy edited with confusing leaps back and forth in time. The dictators brothers sudden leap from a whining coward to a person able to inspire the military and the countries inhabitants to rebel against the dictator I found far less than believable. The bottom line is that if you are able to turn of your brain before the movie starts, you might like this movie, but if you on the other hand are unable to do that, you might not like this movie.",

            "content": "Even by Michael Bay's standards this is utter and I persevered until the end but it never improved, in fact it got worse. The basic plot of billionaire fakes own death and recruits a top team of 'ghosts' to right the wrongs of the world without recourse to, justice, legality, geo politics or just plain old morality is Bay working out his world view where 'obvious bad people' are just summarily dealt with, just like the US did in Iraq and Libya regardless of consequences and it stinks because of that.\nThe film opens with a car chase which is far too long and utterly preposterous to introduce us to the main characters and bond with their witty one liners, a Reynolds trope which is just tiresome now. But we don't bond because it is such a confusing montage in which they miraculously avoid death (apart from one) from multiple bad guys in magically appearing cars (all black of course) while dozens of civilians die as random collateral much like the victims of the US interventions Bay is such a fan of.\nAfter the boredom of the car chase we are led to the nub of the story which is basically a coup to unseat a cartoon bad guy living a life of bling while he oppresses his people in Turgestan (which is a racist trope for so many Muslim countries the US doesn't like) because the shallow billionaire witnessed the dictator gassing his own people in a refugee camp. The dictator is clearly a Saddam/Gaddafi amalgam and the country a mix of Iraq, Syria & Libya which is just lazy, cheap and insulting to the audience. This epiphany has no other relevance and does nothing to explain Reynolds later skills with weapons, how he recruits the others (given that he is dead and his business assets would be unavailable), and his complete lack of emotion about killing people up close - a suited billionaire, really?\nThe film then lurches from one action trope to another as we get some kind of back story for the other characters but this done so badly, so cheesily, so violently, we just don't care. But the group has bonded and on we go to the coup.\nThis is so a Hollywood coup that it's embarrassing; we have a reluctant good brother who the group have rescued to install as new leader - no need for democracy, we know best! We have the guilded presidential palace and over the top statues - again Saddam & Gaddafi, we have a luxury yacht which becomes the final battleground, we have a ridiculous James Bond magnetic device which throws the bad guys around the boat and we have the poor oppressed masses rising up at a moments notice because they see the brother on TV speaking to them - how racist could you possibly be? The TV bit by the way is preceded by a moral aside from Reynolds about the power of state TV in controlling the people - erh, Fox News? BBC?\nNot surprisingly the team win and the dictator captured to be later dropped into a mass of angry civilians who proceeded to tear him to pieces in an obvious Gaddafi reference. None of the team die, which given the sheer volume of ammunition expended is ludicrous, and in a series of cheesy montages go on to live happily ever after although the Reynolds montage makes no sense. No montages of funerals for the hundreds gratuitously killed by the protagonists though.\nNow Michael Bay can make action films where the story drives the action, the violence is largely contained within realistic parameters (given that it's a film) and the characters are somewhat relatable to; Armageddon, Bad Boys, Transformers, 13 Hours even, but this is gratuitous, lazy and frankly racist film making, why Netflix funded it and why Reynolds fronted it is beyond me.",

The movie jumps back and forth through past and present without explanation at a furious pace-only stopping momentarily to frame a Lavazza coffee cup or a Heineken beer or any other of the plethora of sponsors. Lots and lots of ad money.I think this movie feels as if you hooked your brain up to a computer and downloaded a lifetime of memories in 5 seconds-but the memories are useless and stupid and there are 2 hours of them.And the completely unnecessary violence? I feel like Michael Bay was told to keep the violence to a minimum and he was all like, \"Now I'm totally going to brutally murder 2000 people for literally no reason whatsoever-and I'm going to show EVERYTHING.\"\nDid anyone else scrunch and raise their eyebrows at all the unnecessary innocent casualties caused by the \"good guys\"?What was the parkour guy there for? I mean, his position on various rooftops is solely so he can parkour down to the ground when he's needed? Why is he always up there to begin with?In all fairness, I imagine this movie might have been much better if the cut was a full 3 hours long before some exec told Bay to cut it down to 2 hours. So he left all the action scenes and removed literally everything else. I have no idea if that's true. But I hope it is, because WTF?It's a heist movie without the planning parts. I have no idea what happened but there were loads of incredibly corny one-liners stacked up like an assembly line of cheese.They spent a lot of money of this, though-mainly on the explosions and dismembered bodies.The ONLY redeeming part of this film is Ryan Reynolds. As usual, he carried the movie as best he could but something tells me he was told to keep to the script more than usual. So it's not your full RR experience.I call it a movie because it's certainly not a film. It's the kind of mindless action you can watch with your loud buddies and miss just as much of the plot as if you watched it alone.I gave it 3 stars only because of Reynolds.Mildly entertaining cuz 'splosions.",

It is such visual diarrhea that I won't even begin about the terrible, terrible writing. The 2 instead of a 1 star is because I don't want to blame the actors for this. I'm a Ryan Reynolds fan for crying out loud! But this... this is all Michael Bay who, even for his low standards, has vomited out an utter mess. Please don't watch.",

The budget for this movie must have been insane. Seems hardly any expenses were spared to make this flick out-Bond any James Bond movie. The amount of luxury stuff being destroyed is just gratuitous, the technical level is impressive and the action scenes are creative and well crafted. But that's about it.The only surprise is the amount of cursing. It looks like the only thing Bay was missing while producing for the big studios was the R-rating. It fits the movie, so it doesn't feel over the top. What feels too much is the shaky cam videography. At times it's hard to follow what's going on, but then again, that hardly matters in a Bay-Movie. As long as stuff keeps exploding, the target audience won't mind that hardly any scene flows naturally into the next.The only saving grace making this mess watchable is Ryan Reynolds, he never takes the movie serious and as such comes across as the only believeable and mature person in this utter chaos. But even he cannot save the idiotic story line. Whenever the action calms down for a moment, Bay pulls out ludicriously cheap emotion-moments, that border on offensive. The pseudo-politic plot about killing a dictator is incredible stupid and painfully ignorant of the present world situation. The dialogues were written by brain-amputees for brain-amputees. At that point, why even care with a screenplay?But then again, if you know Michael Bay, you know already, if you like it or not.",

            "content": "Here's my review of 6 underground . So you know how you ask your parents for something as a kid and they won't buy it for you , and then your cool uncle buys it for you . That cool uncle of Hollywood rn is Netflix . Martin Scorcesse makes his movies till the 3 hour mark cause studios won't let him make em any longer , uncle netlflix came and said \"whatever you want \" and boom ! You have 'the Irishman' which is almost 4 hours long. And 6 underground is Michael Bay freed of his studio shackles by Netlflix . So before I talk about the movie i'd like to about the man , the myth , the legend , Michael Bay himself. Bay has a style and people can't notice said style unless it's distinguishable . Michael Bay is that one kid who could never get enough of GI JOE , and every single one of his movies glorifies the military which can give call of duty a run for it's money. That's not the only thing he can't get enough of , he can't stand women without makeup . All his movies , even if someone's on their deathbed , they're all heavy on lip gloss and makeup . And you can't be a part of a Michael Bay movie unless you look sexy in every shot , even the sweating needs to make you look cool. Now that's attention to detail . Michael Bay started out making ad films and you can see their influence as his movies are a mix of sports car commercials , lingerie ads and high octane stunts from mountain dew commercials followed by heavy product placement . Bay also has this awkward humour which ranges from racial stereotypes to mispronouncing other movie lines . And last but not least his trademark , explosions ! Bay loves blowing stuff up and makes it look cool by using slo mo shots and music . He also loves his neon colours and uses them whenever he can , even when it's a super secure ghost op. And finally ends his movies with inspirational music followed by montage shots and rolls the credits starting with his name right as the music hits the drop.Now 6 underground is pretty much Batman without the costume and a no kill rule recruiting people around the world to put down a dictatorship . The Bruce Wayne like dude is played by Ryan Reynolds and his crew is played by a couple of Nickelodeon sitcom rejects with the exception of Melanie Laurent , the theatre chick from Inglorious bastards. The movie has no cgi , has three explosive set pieces set in the streets of Florence , a highrise in some Dubai like place and a yacht . That's just about it . But Michael Bay is that hormonal teenager who never grew up , he likes his action and his cool shots , his testosterone and adrenaline flowing . Cause \"teen\" us didn't want drama or romance either , we wanted to see stuff explode and understand one liners and that's just what this movie is , and Michael Bay knows that and so does Ryan Reynolds from all the promotion for this movie , which means that all the Michael bayisms in this movie are completely intentional. All sarcasm apart 6 underground is a bad movie , but a bad - good movie , everyone knows it's bad but it delivers high octane action and that's what we were promised so if you need something to roast on, you have it . so if you know your Bay movies you will have fun picking out all the stupid stuff he does or you just watch it for the action anyway . In the end 6 underground is explosive , blindingly neon , has a lot of slo mo shots , tons of product placement and Linkin park's castle of glass music video summed up into one movie. Seriously though, I never thought I'd type this much for a Michael Bay movie .To quote Steve jobs himself \" You just can't ignore the crazy ones \".",

            "content": "I'm actually a big Michael Bay fan. Even though he had some misses for sure as well. But I consider The Rock still as one of the most entertaining action flicks. Transformers (the first one) was kick-ass and I'm actually few of the people that really liked Pearl Harbor. The last Bay I've seen was 13 hours and that movie was seriously good as well.I love his typical eye-candy style. Yes, It's not very realistic, Yes, I's overdone, but men, I just love the visual aspect of his picture perfect lightning, especially in 4K.\nJust like in this movie. It's all there again.What I also really enjoyed were the action scenes, especially all the SFX with the bodies. I'm sure they invested a lot of time on that SFX because they applied It to pretty much every action scene. But that's ok, since I haven't seen that much before. I\nt made the movie feel more original, which It really needed, because to be honest, most of It was a mess. So I guess this is the part where the positives stop.The storytelling is messy, jumpy and actually half the time I've no idea what happened or how they got where they were. The cutscenes felt as If I went back in time 20 years, but done worse. Like a hyper teenager that still has to learn the fine details of movie making. At least, that's how It felt to me. The cuts were odd at times and just quite annoying and unnecessary.\nDialogues where horrible with very poor one-liners and the actual story was also as generic and whatever as It can be, helped by the poor storytelling.So, yes, It's kind of entertaining. I was annoyed the first 20 minutes, then, when the hyper cuts and poor one-liners stopped and there was finally some time to introduce us to the story I got into It a little more. With actually some epic action sequences that didn't fit with the otherwise quite mediocre and messy movie.So ... a 5 or a 6 is what I end up with. The action scenes and original SFX make it jump to a 6, but men ... this really Is one of Bay's worst achievements.",

A people person.Forget about the plot holes and the whys such as why they target that dude and fight with everything they got instead of trying a small casino first, especially on the first mission. The two things I got problem is the camera work is not good....I watched it pretty closely and there are shots that's so shaky and poorly cut that you'll easily miss some interesting elements they put in. I'm sure they can re-cut it so the action scenes would flow. The other problem is the jokes, it's not that funny at any time you watch it, there's no balance between the humour and the violence.

But then in the next scene they are portrayed as these morally sound heros willing to risk it all without asking for recognition or reward.On a good note the action was fun to watch despite the mostly unbelievable choreography. I mean at one point a guy, shot and bleeding profusely, jumps over 40 feet from a bridge on to the deck of a boat, lands flat on his face, get ups as if it cured his bullet wound and keeps fighting for another 30 minutes.Anyway it was frustrating to watch but if you like stock standard action films and Ryan Reynolds you will probably enjoy this but I wouldn't recommend it to anyone I know.",

Also, the poor storyline, provides the film to be a little bit repetitive, with the everlasting car explosions and helicopter chase downs. Subsequently, one of the most valuable things of this movie is definitely the engagement of the six characters of the team, especially with \"One\" (Ryan Reynolds) being the leader and the one who has to deal with all the nonsense of the whole crew. All the six characters perform really well on what they are supposed to give in terms of the story. Therefore, the lack of a proper script and a continuous and concise storyline, does not provide the proper tone this kind of movie should have.Finally, in a overview the script lacks composure and efficiency.

I felt like it was Michael Bay: Unhinged, as in, Netflix gave him 150 Million and were just like, \"do whatever you want!\", well, he decided to go even thinner on the plot and stuff even more explosions in. Now, this is what I was expecting in the movie, so I wasn't disappointed per se, but I do think it might have helped if a producer or a studio stepped into to at least slightly curb Bay going FULL Bay.Reynolds was still good, the cast overall was good. I thought the parkour guy was about 10 years too late to have in a movie. I thought the graphic violence was unnecessary and added nothing to the movie, in fact I think it hurt the movie.Overall, it's a decent popcorn flick that is worth watching as long as you know to expect.",

There's some sort of a message about war and identity, but it only flies around. The actors surely have a lot of fun on this film.The action sequences... well this is Bay. It features car chases, explosions, slow-mo., sound design that can blow your house, and a surprising level of violence. It's enjoyable, despite the fact that it is poorly edited; we know that the film editors wanted that feeling of speed, and they use that style of editing too much, especially on the car chase sequence.6 Underground is an assumed blockbuster that never stops and a good popcorn movie that you can enjoy in your home, but don't look too much at the story.6 Underground's rating: 4.2/10",

            "content": "OMG people, why so serious??\nI know everybody's entitled to their opinion which is why I felt inclined to use this as my first review and share my opinion. So here it is.\nTo all of those who gave this movie a 1, 2 or 3 star rating you are off your rocker!\nOK, First of all let's state the obvious. This is intended to be nothing more than an action flick. If I was to base my ratting of this film utilizing a scale that compared it to an acclaimed film then I would go 5. But this film doesn't want to be acclaimed, it wants to entertain!! And it did exactly that, BE ENTERTAINING. That is why I would give this film a solid 7 basing this strictly on an entertainment value rating in the action flick genre. And seriously like other reviewers stated that if the backstory, the depth of the script was a little more succinct and it flowed a little better In certain scenes then this film would be an off the charts action film.\nIt would seem that everyone who are in this movie are obviously brilliant, independent film makers that are so good with their craft or perhaps a self anointed intellectual film critic that is so self-revered for their \" I could have done a better job than Michael Bay\" opinion. And yet Michael Bay movie still make lots and lots of money which means a lot of people are going to see them. Hmmmm very interesting.\nSure the script was a little loose, and yes it was a little lacking with the storyline editing BUT HAVE YOU NOT SEEN A MICHAEL BAY FILM?? They are about leaving reality at the theater entrance door. And yes his films are hit and miss but this one, as an action film, is damn close to the bull's-eye .\nMichael Bay only wants to entertain us and he achieves that In spades on 6 Underground. Ryan Reynolds is always best playing himself and in this Film it is no different. He is over the top entertaining with his tongue and cheek humor but also hits all the marks as an action star. The supporting cast was brilliantly international and solid in their roles. Yeah yeah, these are not, nor were they ever intended to be, Oscar worthy nominated roles but all of them pulled their weight and were thoroughly entertaining.Now let's talk about the action. The opening car chase scene was freaking amazing. Brilliantly edited completely unbelievable and 100% insanely entertaining, Sure there's a few mistakes, as in the opening chase sequence , watch how many times their getaway car hits things and the mirror gets ripped off and yet you get to see shots of it afterwards with the mirrors completely intact. Who gives a crap?? If you watch a film just to look at the flaws and pick it apart, how is it possible that you can even enjoy any of it?\nAnd if that's why are you like to review films, so you can pick them apart, why the hell are you watching a Michael Bay movie?\nAnd of course there was gun fights, explosions, and chase scenes however it was toned down from a typical \"Michael Bay, Transformers-esque blow everything up in every scene\" movie. Which made it entertaining enough for my wife to watch it with me, which is seriously saying something about a film like this.\nAnd let's look at the tiny weeny fantasy message in the film. Here is a rag tag group of people who ARE NOT POLITICALLY MOTIVATED that only want to rid the world of really really bad, horrible, despicable people. Who would not want to buy into that?\nOne other thing that I wanted to comment on was with relation to some reviewers mentioning how many innocent people died in this film. Hellooo.... it was all CGI and it was done in a tone of dark humor. In the movie Fargo look how many people got whacked, hacked and mulched in that brilliant film and they were all innocent. And graphically mauled I might add...\nAll in all this was a very entertaining film. Leave your brain at the front door and hop on this bullet train of action, fun and frivolity.\nAnd I am truly looking forward to the sequel because you can be sure there will be one.",

Don't get me wrong, I am fine with all that. If I sit my arse on a Friday night, and play that movie in a relaxing netflixing night, I am totally aware of what it is.\nThe problem is that the movie is a nonsense. The messy montage, the lack of storyline and the uninteresting characters makes the entire movie hard to watch; in spite of the music, one-liners, gunfights, executions, blood and all sorts of vehicles at high speed, the movie is boring.

It reinforces a dangerous idea that so long as you're 'right', you can kick off a fight however you want with impunity and utter disregard for any other point of view.

Even the actors, Ryan Raynolds and Melanie Laurent, seriously? It's like melting Deadpool and Inglorious Bastards together, two tonally very different movies.\nMusic is off most of the times and plot gets messy toward the end. Some characters are introduced while others completely forgotten/ignored/overly mysterious. Plenty of action though and even bigger body count (in many nasty ways to go;).Overall not a bad movie to spend the evening, but should've chosen a path and sticked to it.",

            "content": "If you payed any attention to Michael Bay's career up until now you'd know that he continues to have very little subtlety and making modest pictures was never his intention. Netflix also has a noteriety of producing loads and loads of garbage while masking it as something different. So combining the two makes sense, right? It does and it doesn't and having one of the first things you see (followed by slow motion airplane stunts) is the Red Bull logo you know 2 things immediately: 1, this movie is most likely made for teenagers and 2, this movie will be a glorious waste of money while at the same time making more money than is appropriate for something never planned for anything more than mediocre. I will stand by my first statement, as unpopular as it is, because as teenagers we have our lowest tolerance for anything decent so this movie in all it's excess plays exactly to the kind of child-like anger that fills all of us...plus our need to watch stuff explode over and over and over again. And then just about every 2 minutes comes a new product placement. It's crazy, really, because despite being crammed expensive product down our throats one after another it ends up feeling very cheap, very empty, almost like a 125 minutes commercial: cars, beers, clothes, mega-conglomerates of all kinds it goes on and on! Despite all these issues I wanted to hate the movie but Michael Bay has always been a very entertaining director capable of pushing around piles of large money while not making us feel hateful of the waste but instead entertained. Ryan Reynolds is also very charming and fun to watch, the locations are great, and the stunts and special effects seem impossible. The comedy is there as a way to make it easily digestible and seem familiar, although I laughed out loud at maybe only two or three character reactions. So this movie is fun, not great, but it is the true definition of a \"movie\" a mindless spectacle that should make you smile if you are still human, all other haters must just be very bitter they did not make any money off this transaction themselves. Netflix, once again, appears to be more in the money side of entertainment so it's questionable whether to even really consider them a production company or not but here they made good on their rights to buy this one and show it to us like the good times we deserve.",

            "content": "Six Underground tells the story of six individuals (Reynolds, Laurent, Garcia-Rulfo, Hardy, Arjona and Hawkins) who form a vigilante squad in order to take down some of the world's most corrupt individuals. After a problematic mission in Florence, they do obtain the whereabouts of the dictator of Turgistan (Raz) in order to replace him with his imprisoned brother (Maadi) who is an outspoken critic of the dictator who would likely lead the sovereign nation as a democracy.I was intrigued by the premise of this movie, it is very similar to that of Suicide Squad, Rogue One and the first Guardians of the Galaxy except in a real-life setting. However it does fall into some of the pratfalls of these movies, for example, very thin characterization of its heroes and villains. It does make clear who is who and what their basic morality and skill sets are, however that is basically all they are given, the rest of the character is their abiding by the rules mentality, endless amount of pop culture references and maybe some relationship drama. No one in this movie really has a character arc, which is a little problematic because their movie has set up plot threads in the squad's personal lives, and it just seemed like the mission was the main story. The team needed to move on from their lives by dying and leaving all their personal problems in the past, and the movie couldn't even do that correctly. And this drama does not even really factor into the main plot in a way that is relevant. This is where they could have really used the Guardians of the Galaxy style of character building: a group of strangers who are generally incompatible set aside their differences for the good of the nation, however it ends up copying Rogue One and Suicide Squad.Due to its rapid character introduction, the scattershot plot structure and shaky camerawork in its action sequences, it is exhausting to keep track of everything in this movie. Don't get me wrong the set pieces and action sequences when does right are phenomenal, however the trailer does give away the best moments in the movie. There are some really cool set pieces, particularly one on a boat, one on the Duomo and the crane sequence, however they are almost all given away by the trailer and the ones that aren't are shrouded by so much shaky camerawork that it is difficult to tell who is fighting who or who is winning. The parkour scenes are definitely the best filmed and the first car chase in this movie probably looked really cool on a storyboard however a director that cares about fluidity would have made it more engaging by just keeping the camera in focus or by not cutting every two seconds. The film is directed by Michael Bay, and if I didn't know that I would have guessed in about ten minutes.This is really is the movie that will be most associated with Michael Bay. It has all of his signature styles cranked up to eleven. Anything that has been associated with him: explosions, lens flares, military and helicopters, low angles, product placement, bass drops, strobe light effects etc. are all on display, and fans of him will love this movie because of that. People who has a thirst for action will also get a kick out of it as this set piece after set piece of violence with occasional breaks for talking. So if you have run out of Fast and Furious movies or wished the Mission Impossible movies were simpler in their story, this is for you. However a much more satisfying experience, at least for me is to just watch the trailer.",

I am glad this Film exists, It has soul. The characters save most of the film, they are way too Many and somewhat unidimensional but I think the movie finds a way by the end to give them subtle Depth. I disliked the main characters Arc ending, way too ambiguous asking for a sequel, I think this would of worked better as a TV show but It would take away From the childish mess Bay does AND which I truly love.

Oh yes. And with his dream of a 15 rating and the budget he needed, Bay created something that could be considered entertaining. Could.The second half of the film feels like a solid spy film to throw on in the background and fulfil your boredom for an hour. It isn't offensive to me and has some decent action. However, as you can guess, the first half is quite the opposite. In fact there is no story in the first half, it's mere scatters of introductions and action sequences squished together. How can a film take an hour to establish six characters? In fact how do they manage to mess that up too? They spend so much time slowing down the film for three of the characters, that the rest are all left suffering from the audience not caring enough about them. Bay clearly didn't know which direction he'd like to go and in doing so did all of them, but didn't even finish said directions. For example, as we progress through the second half hour, numbers independently transition on screen to show so-called backstory for these characters. But after 3 they simply forget that this structure existed and threw it out the rest of the film.I should discuss the characters too, as in any ensemble film, they should be the heart of the film. But this film misses the mark here too, due to what I mentioned earlier where they simply passed over half the cast and hope you catch to on their characters. One (Ryan Reynolds) is the well established character who's known as \"The Billionaire.\" Despite this, they seem to only use this for quippy dialogue and plot convenience. He would be much better suited as \"The Leader\" or a name more related to his expertise of technology, that served as a much more interesting character trait other than being typical Ryan Reynolds. He only seems to be driven by one motivation to save the world and when bringing in the idea of him leaving his family, you'd imagine this would be an inner conflict we'd see develop and or at least be showcased? Not at all, instead he just visits his son as the end and runs off for a sequel I suppose. I don't think it matters about the other characters, they're all just given irrelevant subplots that mean nothing to us. Five suffers the most from this because I don't think she's given anything to work with, instead of being The Doctor, she's just The Woman. Classic Bay.I'm getting exhausted just thinking about this film any longer so to conclude, I believe this film suffers from poor editing and direction, especially from the first hour holding back the potential of the story showcased following this. The pacing and dialogue also fell flat, and characters existing more as objects than personality. Despite all of this, the film has some very good action sequences, the cast clearly give it their all and the soundtrack keeps you in the film. I hope the rumoured sequel does not suffer its predecessor's fate.",

HELL YES!That said, I actually think 6 Underground is one of his better movies in terms of storytelling, yet ironically it is one of my least favorite in terms of the way it was scripted/ formatted.The nonlinear narrative worked well for Deadpool, but I feel it was a disservice to this film. I know it's the same screenwriters with RR, so it makes sense they would try that route again, but it really hurt the flow of the film. Too much. Take any screenwriting class and they warn you about using too many flashbacks or nonlinear narrative. Is that a rule? Of course not, but when it works, it can really work. When it doesn't, epic fail. That's what this felt like to me. It was bordering on tedious, especially when you're \"all caught up\", but then you aren't really as they insert more flashbacks.The second-half of the movie was handled deftly and I was more engaged are the story became linear, barring a few quick flashbacks. I feel it would have been a much more solid film if it followed the linear path from the beginning, peppering in a few flashbacks here and there.It was still enjoyable because of the Bayhem, but I would have scored it higher if not for the way the story was told.

The problem is that the movie keeps a certain awareness level so you need to stay and watch every minute but once you've watched it, you'll be so confused on what happened because it is basically an action movie plain and simple but its made like a puzzle you need to solve.

My guess is that they thought Ryan Reynolds was Dane Cook and I could see how they could get them confused but even Cook couldn't make EVERYTHING funny.How could they squeeze more entertainment into only one film.... who better to explain all the plot points than Morgan Freeman unless of course you have Ryan Reynolds cast; actually I've only watched the first 45 minutes (needed a break) so Freeman could be in the movie I guess. I was going to do a Tom Cruise comparison about screen time but I've run out of steam, watch the movie and good luck.",

Unfortunately, the characters aren't that memorable or interesting enough with small glimpses of their past. But they Are people who wanna do good in the world. The scenes were fully action packed to the point where u really can't focus ur eyes on one particular fight or shot. It's a little all over the place. One part of the story seemed very much inspired by the Fall of Saddam Hussain. So originality isn't really big in this movie . But one thing is for sure - the. Soundtrack is absolutely perfect. Watching this movie once is enough , rewatchable? Don't think so but if you love action then yes.

Intrigued, I continued watching and found myself starting to laugh and enjoy the over the top madness as it became clear that this wasn't a Bond parody, it was Michael Bay parodying himself to some extent with lots of Hollywood references giving it a familiar feel.Some of the cuts are jarring, the whole thing is predictable and it comes with a good helping of cheese.

Why Michael Bay thinks the camera needs to shake during scenes of dialogue or pans and zooms, I just don't get. He has such potential to make actual blockbusters cause his visions are so grand but... another wasted investment from Netflix.",

            "content": "Just imagine Jeff Goldblum staring at a massive pile of Dino poo, that right there is Suicide Squad, now imagine an even bigger pile of Dino poo beyond, that is 6 Underground and boy is it stinking hot.This is everything bad about Michael Bay and much more. I thought it would be bad from seeing the trailers. But like normal bad, not bad bad. Not this bad. Firstly the writing is atrocious. The dialogue is cringeworthy and lazy. The story is simple but at the same time all over the place. The bad guy is...well...who the hell is he? He is so forgettable and one dimensional. He does nothing but have a couple scenes of bad guy talk, looking very constipated and bald. The main protagonists are equally forgettable, they have very little character to them, you can't tell them apart. I didn't care if any of them died, or whether they met their mother, or got the girl. I found myself being a neutral, I wasn't supporting anyone to win because I wasn't given a reason to.This film is so far up its own bum thinking their actors have chemistry that they think it would be great to have them almost improvise comedy one liners at every turn. THERE IS NO CHEMISTRY. Not even a smidge. The \"comedy\" they try to implement is eye-rolling bad. Ryan Reynolds is Ryan Reynolds, for the 100th time. I mean it works in Deadpool but there's only so many references he can make before it becomes tedious.The editing in this film is the worst I've seen in years. We go between past and present so much in the first act they actually had me confused at one point as to where we were. We're in the past - ok now we're in the present - a couple scenes later... Reynolds \"and now you're all caught up\" (TITLE) \"The Present\"...WTF? This and jump cuts every 10 seconds, shaky cam, chase scenes are poorly done, they show the hero do some cool stunt and get away but the next shot there's a bad guy right behind them. Even though there is so much happening on the screen I was still getting bored.One specific complaint I have with the laziness of this story is the revolt scene. So a guy speaks on camera to try and inspire a troubled nation who has been mistreated by a dictator, he literally speaks for no more than 30 seconds and says \"we need to start a revolution\" at the end. THE VERY NEXT SHOT is of people protesting in the streets with some crappy pop song going on in the background. How did we get to there? This dude says a couple of lines and he's all of a sudden started, what looks like, a full scale civil war. People have torches and weapons and are attacking armed soldiers no more than a minute after we saw them everyone just going about their daily business. Who wrote, directed and then edited this and thought, \"oh yes this makes a lot of sense, it definitely doesn't feel like we've cut a million corners just so we move the story along\". I honestly started to laugh because it made no sense.I really am tired of Michael Bay. He can't make an actually decent action movie. This is $150 million down the drain. That could have been used for a nice charitable donation this Christmas, or at least used to make a good standard action flick. But instead it feels like a present given to naughty kids to teach them a lesson.In short, you have no reason to watch this movie, its bad at every turn. Nothing from this film has made me feel like I spent the last 2 hours wisely. Best you lot miss this and enjoy Christmas. Now I'm going to drink till my memory of this starts to fade.",

Because we've seen it in movies, we've seen it in real life and let's just say we know enough on this.I have some issues with the character Ryan Reynolds is playing. I think I liked him more in the final part where he revealed himself as a tech genious. I guess he was too serious in the first part, which simply doesn't work for him. Also, I didn't get why Number 4 had a British accent, when a Russian one would work so much better for the character.Finally, the story starts super big and promising, but in the end, it's just one heist. So that disappoints too. But as a whole, the movie is very good visually, it's also very funny, so yeah, I recommend.",

It's a comedy, and it also has political tones without bashing any particular side. In fact that it could pretty much be argued that it bashas both sides of the American political spectrum, and at the same time shows the positives that each side has.

The dialogue was written terribly. Whoever wrote the script really having a coke out while writing the whole script.The cast performance was good. Ryan Reynolds is Ryan Reynolds. Melanie Laurent definitely the best thing in this movie. As for the others,they also quite good but I was so sad that the movie doesnt explore their chemistry in this movie.The action sequence was good. It's what you expect from Michael Bay. Full of explosion and lot of posing. My favorite will be the Italy car chase scene.Overall, this movie isn't good and it isn't bad either.

That said, in that half an hour I picked up on more continuity errors than we'd had witty one-liners so the cons far outweigh the pros with this one.The first 20 minutes, (not an exaggeration) is pretty much solely a car chase. A very, OTT car chase at that where we, the viewer have little clue who is chasing them and why. But of course, it's Michael Bay so there's just hundreds of seemingly very strategically placed goons to crash into and blow up spectacularly.The story itself makes a bit of sense but the way it's told, it's all over the place. So many flashbacks, and when Dave Franco's character dies, (which honestly, in the first half hour, for an actor of his stature is a bit of a travesty) you've not even got to his back story yet so, what's the point. You've not had time to care about his character.And that's just it. You don't care about the characters. It's not even, 'put it on to catch some good humour and explosions', it's too frustrating a watch to even do that.Avoid.",

You have a really talented group of actors in this picture and Corey Hawkins, whose acting is left with mediocrity, and I'm left scratching my heading - asking how did it go so bad. Then I remember that Michael Bay directed this movie. This movie had ingredients of a really fun, fast paced, and character driven movie but all we're left with is overdramatic explosions, car chases, and head scratching deaths. The movie stops and restarts itself with too many interludes of characters' backstory that just become unnecessary word vomit. This is probably the worst Ryan Reynolds movie since Green Lantern and Michael Bay's worst movie since Transformers 2. Again, it's extremely disappointing because this movie had all the makings of a really great movie - story concept, actors, and locations but was poorly executed by a has been director and third rate editing team.

Viewers are \"treated\" to a mindless, wild, crash filled, shoot-em-up in the city of Florence, Italy, somehow managing to drive their car all over town, including into a third floor chamber and all around a major museum, somehow never going near stairs.\nThe camera work throughout the film is music video or first person shooter unnecessary. Lots of stunts but character development. Just bullets,bombs, crashes, a bit of sex, blood, executions, explosions, zoom, bang, pow.\nI sincerely hope the producers paid the city of Florence at least $10 million for the time this film shoot disrupted their city.\nAn incredibly waste of time and money.",

Due to the varied perspective that Michael Bay has applied to this film it shows an exciting and up to date use of modern technology and cinematography to create an exhilarating piece of movie art.",

            "content": "If you have ever seen any Michael Bay movie, then you should already know what to expect from this one, lots of action and tons of explosions. This movie looked like it was going to be really good. It had an original idea, it had Ryan Reynolds in it, and it was being produced by Netflix. I truly thought that it had a lot going for it. Unfortunately it was directed by Michael Bay, so there were bound to be some flaws.This is by no means a terrible movie, and I would have to say that it is actually one of Michael Bay's better films (Which isn't saying much) But it did have its fair share of problems. Most of the cast, including Ryan Reynolds, played very unlikable characters that were mostly one dimensional, and several of them had backstories that were very quickly glossed over. Much of the dialogue was very poorly written, and there were numerous attempts at humor, most of which fell flat. The movie was also two hours, which is the typical length of a film these days, but it felt like it was never going to end at times. This movie also did not need to be rated R, but Bay decided that it would be a good idea to insert horror movie levels of gore in to the film. You get to see all sorts of things like corpses with blown off heads, and limbs get ripped off of people, as well as much more. This was completely unnecessary, and it could have easily been PG-13, while still being pretty much the same exact film. The editing and pacing also really dragged the film down, as is the case in most Michael Bay films, as it is very choppy and poorly done, causing the movie to be extremely hard to follow at times.There were a few redeeming qualities to the film however. Overall, the acting was fairly good, with a few exceptions. And of course, as you have come to expect from a Michael Bay film, the action set pieces and special effects were superb, and really made the film worth watching. They weren't just the typical action scenes that you would see in a generic film either, some of them were very clever and have not been done before. They made the film a lot more exciting and engaging, so at least it does a good job at keeping the audiences attention. There were a couple jokes that made me smile at times, but like I said previously, most of them fell pretty flat.This is most definitely a popcorn flick that you should watch with a bunch of your friends on the weekend, and that is what it is meant to be. You are supposed to shut off your brain for two hours and have a good time, and if you can do that, then you will really enjoy this movie. There is a scene in the film that is literally meant to set up potential sequels, and I am interested to see what they end up doing with that if they do decide to make a sequel. They just need to improve on some of those things that I pointed out earlier and they may have something similar to the Fast & Furious franchise on their hands.",

It will be the most entertaining, action packed, patriotic, and even sexy film you will see all year, but at the same time it is also a corny, degrading, repulsive cringe-fest. Explosions? Yes. Exotic cars? Yes. Beautiful woman, violence and absolute mayhem? YES, YES, YES. This is why I'm so split on this film. I love it and I hate it. The characters are not all terrible but good acting and writing is not a thing in this film. Some characters are redeeming while some (Skateboard Kid) are annoying enough to make you want to bash your head in a wall. The music choices are horrific, the villain is borderline special needs.. and a scene in the film where a revolution begins felt more like the Pepsi commercial that Kendall Jenner was in some years ago. Overall 5/10 - you won't regret watching it that's for sure",

Speaking of the car chase, there were a lot of good shots of car crashes and explosions from different angles and perspectives which is awesome. However, I noticed something in the car crashing and explosions that there were numerous scenes that bodies actually flew up and out and away and bounced off of other things including the pavement and in one scene there was even a charred body lying close to one of the characters on the street after a crash. That was a little too much as far as I'm concerned. I think special affects have gotten really goood over the years without the flying burnt bodies and the films have been great.

In order to act unrecognized, he staged his own death. His six-member team supports this libertarian, completely undemocratic approach to the best of its ability - and of course Bay does not criticize it, but rather reinforces the message by aggressively promoting the products of large corporations.

I'm not ashamed to call this chase one of the best action scenes ever made.

The dialogue is uninspired and terrible, they must've used exposition to tell us the premise of the movie at least five or six times. \"We had to die to become ghosts and fix the world.\" Ok thanks for telling me over and over again, I'm not sure I got that. Although to be fair the script is so awful there's no guarantee that would be understood if it was left up to the story. The whole movie is chock full of fadish techniques, extreme camera angles, moving cameras pointlessly in still scenes, egregious shakey cam, super close ups, irritating and fake lense flares, and perhaps worst of all not giving the audience enough time or screen space to enjoy some of the fabulous locations the had available.I don't know what the people making this were thinking but it just not worth it.

Some rich, white tech-wiz decides to go after an evil dictator of some fictional Middle Eastern republic. He does this using his deep pockets, his know-how and a team of anonymous experts, stringing together some crash-bang-wallop jobs in different parts of the world. Oh, and he's apparently dead, which nevertheless doesn't stop him from obtaining the otherwise unobtainable weapons and equipment.\nThroughout the film the timeline goes back and forth without much reason or explanation... which left me completely befuddled as to what is actually happening, when, where and why. This isn't helped at all by the way the movie was put together, what with quick cuts, short scenes and shaky camera. When the plot finally stabilises halfway through the movie, it moves quickly to an entirely predictable, and utterly naive, conclusion.There are car chases, where the good guys kill dozens of innocent bystanders, whilst driving a neon-green product-placement \"getaway\" vehicle. Actually, come to think of it, the \"good guys\" in 6U are at least as desensitized as the \"bad guys\". Don't quote me on that, but it seems they cause more deaths and suffering through their actions than the \"bad guys\" they're after.There is over the top gore. Human bodies ragdoll across the screen almost constantly, almost as if the director had an unhealthy fascination with people being ran over by cars on full speed, tossed around in explosions, dropped from tall buildings and impaled on forklifts. I am not squeamish and have no qualms over violence in movies, but 6U has a lot of gratuitous scenes where fake blood spatters the camera lenses. Really bad taste.The actors were definitely not overworked, as their characters had a perceived emotional depth and personalities of a 6x4 plank. Waste of talent really as the dialogue consists almost solely of cheesy one-liners, mostly quotes from other, non-Michael-Bay movies, interspersed with swear words, mostly of the m-f- and f-bomb type. Again, I don't mind foul language on the screen, but these were delivered flat, without emotion and felt almost out of place. When tense action called for a well placed \"\", none were given.In the end, the movie was just a long blur of explosions, blood, shooting, flying bodies, crashing cars and expensive surroundings being reduced to rubble, crowned with an after-action shot of our heroes departing into the setting sun.In conclusion... I believe there are three prerequisites to enjoy 6 Underground: 1 - you enjoyed Michael Bay movies before, 2 - you left your brain somewhere safe, and 3 - you have already decided that two hours of your life will go to waste one way or another.",

If that wasn't bad enough, we can't even get a clear picture of the store because once a character starts to talk about something - skips to the next character. Absolutely no time to build a story with too much of his over the top explosions and panning left and panning right. It's an okay move with the actors doing their best.

If you can't go watch a bunch of fun action with some excellent camera work and good acting, I don't know why you watched it in the first place, because the movie just exuded that from the preview alone.

This is desensitizying trash that no one should watch if they value what it is to be human.",

Cars, guns, fights, big boats, skyscrapers, womans, blood, humor, drama... i mean...this movie has it all! And i mean from the beginning to the end!

However they go through and sort of promote an extremely troubled approach as to set a coup and organizing to replace the president with an extremely weak and incapable young brother and even finalizing the film with deliberate lynch against the thrown president. What do the producers want the audience to feel and take away from this film? I found this extremely troubled and morally questionable.",

And really deserves a sequel - despite what som pretentious jerks are saying. 6 underground is way to good to not get a sequel! The characters in the first movie deserves another ride! They are to good to be wasted on only one movie.And yeah - the whole cast is wonderful. And it is also pretty funny full of witty lines and top class CGI and action. I am pretty sure this movie will grow and become more appreciated over the coming years. But then it is too late for a sequel. So it has to be done soon. I am pretty sure the IMDb rating will rise when people rewatch it years later or a new younger audience discover it. 6.1/10 is really a joke!",

The disorientation you get trying to follow this story with near on constant flash backs, flash forwards and location changes is a migraine of epic proportions . Add the pointless back stories for the main characters who waffle on and mumble equally pointless dialogue make you want to lie down in a dark room. I assume most of the banter should be making the audience laugh or at least chuckle. It doesn't. Even Ryan Reynolds schtick barely registers.On the action front it is jaw dropping and absolutely barmy. At times the flying, disintegrating and exploding cars are fun to watch but as much as it's polished it becomes tiresome and oddly un-exciting pretty quickly. The visual gloss is blinding at times and the overly used glam slow mo tedious. The locations are for the most part the stunning Abu Dhabi even though we are told they are Las Vegas, Hong Kong or some fake Middle Eastern country and the various gun fights and battles in exotic looking buildings and on boats make Bond and Bourne look tatty in comparison but it doesn't help the muddled story and jarring experience. On the plus side the CGI is some of the most polished you will see on the screen at the moment. But this isn't enough to make this film a likeable and entertaining action movie. And some may find the gratuitous bloody violence and gun play - not to mention the amount of innocent bystanders that seem to get maimed because of the groups antics too much for their liking.",

Great acting skills (obviously, being that it stars Ryan Reynolds), super intense action scenes, plot was easy to follow and made sense, awesome visual effects, and the ending was ... wow. Loved it!There were only 2 issues with this movie:\nThere's is no connection with the characters. The beginning of the movie stars Dave Franco as 6 aka The Driver. Very good actor and is killed off super quick. However, the other characters want to portray this as \"sad\" however, we just met the character. I like the actor, but I don't really identify with a character I just met 5 minutes ago. Then throughout the whole movie, Ryan Reynolds character (One) is battling an internal conflict revolving around being a rich stuck up, leaving the love of his life, trying to keep everything and everyone at a distance and not too close, etc. However, at no point in the movie do I feel for him or really identify with him. I see what the movie was going for as a character, but it was too rushed and didn't hit the mark.Second issue, is this movie is what I would title: A Man's Movie. Like the movie 300 or any transformers movie, its just a lot of action, explosions, sexy women, some comedy, etc. This is great for entertainment and I still recommend it. But don't expect anything in depth, emotional, or something requiring brain cells to enjoy. Just 2 hours of entertainment, and then move on.Still, I give it 9/10 and do highly recommend this if you want something visually pleasing, and very entertaining.",

The music was selected by a 12 year old watching youtube videos all day. The humor was cringy, and the fact that it is over the top on purpose doesnt make it less annoying. It is obvious that michael bay went in with the intention to make the most michael bay movie ever, and the result is a bad movie. It being purposefully bad, makes it nonetheless bad.

I hope the haphazard nature of my review will reflect well with how haphazard the film is itself. No real story, senselessly arranged cuts that have no semblance of order, corny lines, random (albeit beautiful) international locations, mix-matched music choices, destructive car chases and explosions everywhere. I mean, EVERYWERE! Car hits a wall? Explosion. Rebar falls onto ground? Explosion. Van parks in a field? Explosion. Man falls down? EXPLOSION!I mean look, I love Bay's action flicks and explosions but this is just too much. It gets tedious just a few minutes in. I never though I would say this but there IS such a thing as too much action in a single film. The potentially thrilling car chase for example, became inane with abnormally vast quantities of carnage and blood. The film could have done without the over-the-top parkour and corny humor that makes little sense. The score makes it hard to figure out who they were really trying to appeal to. One scene they make fun of millennial and the next, they choose music from internet memes. They try to balance this with humor that relies on repetition.There is almost zero character building or a hint of originality. In fact, Ryan Reynolds is an almost exact duplicate of his role in Deadpool, just a little more politically correct. The rest are as characterless as they come.The pace, is too fast. Quite like those 'XYZ in 10 minutes' YouTube videos, the flick feels like a shortened summary version of what could have been a 12 episode TV mini-series.The only way I can explain away this spawn of a film is that either Michael Bay has lost it and gone senile way too early or this was some kind of a parody. Watch it if you have nothing else to watch and just want to see some Acton with friends and popcorn. Otherwise move on and watch something else.",

The production clearly showed a budget and nothing else. But, the worst factor about this movie was by far the script. The most hollow, un-relatable and non convincing characters possible. From wardrobe changes mid scene, to backstories that dont add up, to foreshadowing that never amounts to anything, to random switches in character traits with no prompting this was a shameful finished product. I don't know what they paid to cast Reynolds, but it's the only reason I even finished watching this.",

To those who got upset that so many innocent people were killed, can we refer back to all the Transformer movies, the Avengers, or maybe even a Ghostbusters movie.

From hanging out a window in a close up shot yelling, \"baby baby baby\" while in the long shot Ryan is in the car. To blood squirting onto a face and then not being there. Bad edit after bad edit quickly overshadowed everything.Then there's the fact we were halfway through the movie and it still felt like they were introducing the characters and premise of the movie.Then there's the character flaws, the plot inconsistencies, the odd decisions like a death leading to the lead saying now he needed to recruit a new member but then replacing the loss of that skill set with a completely different skillset: seemingly just to keep the number in the group at six? I could write so much more but it would take me longer than it took to watch the movie and I'd probably need to rewatch it to get some of the details right and that ain't happening. Suffice to say the problems really do go on and on.But worst of all - and I mean this is THE thing which is most worrying about the whole movie - it looks like they've left things open for a sequel.

But every time he tells the audience about how death made him a ghost is just plain and simple boring. Melanie Laurent, Dave Franco (albeit for the first 10 minutes only) and others were just as good as the films story line.The action sequences are choreographed with finesse. I was able to differentiate the CGI in just one scene, so overall pretty great work by the VFX team.I would like to point out some problems with the script of the movie. Whoever wrote the dialogues was probably drunk out of his mind, In the second half of the movie, there is a conversation about the 'snatch'. I couldn't help but wonder. \"Why?\". I am trying not to think hard about it, and i cant keep thinking.Overall, if you are a Transformers and Michael Bay fanboy or fangirl, do watch this movie in all its glory.",

You can't get more undercover. The first 10 minutes in this latest fixture of this director more fond of engine revving than film directing, take place in a city that saw their share of real directors in the past, and serve to introduce to us the glamorous team that will take on cruel tyrants: a billionaire always showing his mug through the aforementioned car's window, a doctor performing medical procedures while on speed, a driver that does both the driving and the drooling over local mates and both the hitting of pedestrians (crashing weddings too) and the sparing of botched puppies. It has become apparent I wasn't going to spend the remaining 2 hours in their company knowing very well that the dictator and his generals don't stand a chance against this director and his (s)crew(s). It was rigged right from the start and up until the very end. The rest was just engine revs as a poet once said.I opted for no spoilers for this review as you can't possibly spoil this. It's like cinematic pasta. You can boil it way past the purchase date and even reheat it. The IQ level permeating from the script is concisely captured in a single line from the Parkourist: \"there are so many f* vias in Italy\" Right? I wonder what streets are. I was thrilled to see empowered women in this. Doing the exact same sh* men did. At this point movies seem like schemes of money laundering. A solid 1 star from me for the performances and the direction(?) and 10 for the scheme, I mean the script. Mindless doesn't even begin to describe what's on camera. The filmmaker and his crew flashes you incessantly with the most hideous car crashes and accident deaths. This is a textbook for psychiatry and both target audience and film crew are due for a check. I would not be surprised to find out that IS filmmakers were co-opted as experts for this or at least that their work was painstakingly studied.",

I love there channel and I saw this on Netflix but didn't give it a second glance until I saw them doing the stunts for it and then showing small clips of the scenes they were doing. I love a good action movie but with a comedic act. And Reynolds nails it like always. The rest of the cast is terrific! They are all so different but Bay did an amazing job at making them all fit together perfectly. Of course Michael Bay is a big big name director. And it's obvious why. Now the sounds effects he used for transformers was perfect. Like weird metal flexing sounds and random low and high toned horns. Nailed the sound effects for the Transformers Trilogy.\nThis is where Bay starts to loose me with 6Underground. Look I get he loves a descriptive action scene, take the magnetic boat for example! Wow! There was so much going on with the guys bouncing from wall to wall and having knives from the kitchens stab through them and all sorts of crazy things happening and taking out the bad guys. But the sound effect...why Michael!!?? Wwhhhhhhyyyyy!!!!!? Everytime I hear that slow motion sound effect all I can think about is bumble bee slow motion flying through the air over Mark Wahlbergs head and transforming from a car to a transformer. That sound doesn't incorporate into this movie lol. And the low tone horn sounds for the magnet when Reynolds turns it on? God Bay! You have to leave those sounds with specific movies. I'm not sure if he just loves those sounds so much that hes going to use them in every single movie he makes? But it's annoying. I'm sure I'm part of a small number of people who think this but there could have been better sound effects made for this movie instead of the ones that were bing used. Like I said, eveytime I heard them all I could think about was transformers! But I'm not watching Transformers! I'm watching a better movie with amazing firearms and great action scenes, I want to be pulled into these crazy action scenes and sucked into the movie, but I can't cause everytime some crazy scene happens and that 95% of the movie I hear another recycled sound effect he's used in all his other movies lol. And it kills me! I'm always going to link these sounds with Transformers because these sounds fit transformares soooooo well. But not this movie!\nPlease come up with new sound effects for every new film you release!! Stop recycling the sounds. It's getting so annoying. I gave this a 7 only because the sound effects just drive me Nuts. But this movie deserves a 10.",

But one thing that the film does differently is the amazing camera work and color choices such as the use of lime green and the always changing camera angles. Unfortunately the film has trouble with its tones as many emotional parts of the film are brushed off with a poorly written joke. One other thing I did enjoy about the movie was how each character has their own purpose to the group. Such as One (Ryan Reynolds) being the leader and having a free runner (Ben Hardy). But even though Ryan Reynolds is the biggest name in the cast, it fells like he's playing the same character as in Deadpool, just richer and less violent. The plot is also quite choppy with scenes jumping from year to year and place to place every couple minutes. But something that helps to redeem the movie is how it has a really bad bad guy.

I don't mind flash back, or choppy editing...but this is taking a piss. In some places it worked, but when you do flash back and choppy bits every 10-15 mins, it makes you lost the concentration of the on-going \"current\" storyline they are trying to tell.Some characters have a nice built up, but feel the parkour guy and the doctor lady seemed to be a bit of a waste of their character built up...maybe I was looking for more. It'd be nice to see each character has their own \"heroic\" moment that makes you feel, \"Yeah man!!! Go Go Go!!!\" Kung Fu Hustle was very good at that, and since then, rarely see the same amazing built up for a film that consists of multi-lead characters. Marvel's End Game did it, but not without the help of some individual standalone movies with the key characters. Anyway...There are some really nice scenes in this film, the fight scenes are good, punch lines are not bad (some are funnier than others)... just perhaps a bit less choppy editing, more of a coherent story telling, and less plot device (made something happen in order to feed another character's cause of action etc.)This type of film I can only watch it once based on curiosity.

I mean 4 didn't even get a choice in this. Why did 2 leave CIA and became a ghost? Why did the hitman join? Was the hitman not informed that they are not supposed to contact their families?It feels like a blatant A-Team rip-off at times given each ghost is supposed to have a special ability and a unique character, and then the plan of action is narrated / explained as it is being executed.Within the first half an hour you can tell that the movie producers are already hoping to make a sequel / franchise out of this.Finally, I was disappointed by Ryan Reynolds' use in this movie. It seemed either he wasn't totally into his role or it wasn't written properly. It just seems they wasted his potential with a poorly written character.I'm giving it few stars just because of the crazy stunts they would had to do, otherwise it's a waste of time.",

No caped crusader. But instead we get the witty and talented Ryan Reynolds as Number One. Leading a well-chosen cast in a funny but emotional, high octane, superbly directed and shot film. That I would have paid to see in a theater, and would have enjoyed to rewatch on Netflix!To all the naysayers this is a movie that's about the car chases, and explosions and death-defying stunts that we've come to love from Michael Bay. No one really does it with the grandeur that he does. I hope it becomes a franchise.",

Along with Reynolds surprisingly good performances from Ben Hardy and Corey Hawkins. Unfortunately Bay continues to miss use any female actress, but they do what they can with what there given. One of my personal favorite performances is the odd ball Manuel Garcia-Ruflo. Whenever he's on screen I found myself laughing.",

When you try to over compensate these ingredients, movies usually fall short.With 6 underground as an ardent movie fan I thought they ticked all the boxes and delivered a great package.The opening scene was fast paced great car scene and driving at its best. Many movies like fast and furious etc go overkill on cgi/special effects and forget what makes people come to the movies for their love of cars. They over compensate and make the movie scene humanly impossible And kill a good story line.6 Underground had the underpinnings of a great movie\nDecent plot, story line and great action. There was never a dull moment. Really liked it sadly it never played on IMAX (or big screen) where it would have truly shined.I was fortunate enough to watch it on a projector with Dolby atmos soundbar which added the cinema effect.Thank you Netflix for this great movie in my opinion shines like the good old classics such as bad boys.",

Also with this type of movie you need a second movie and to get to know the characters more. It would've done super well as a tv show in my opinion, where they choose people to take down (kind of like the blacklist) and have different episodes on it. Overall i would recommend in hopes of a second movie to back it up. Has some laughable moments too!",

The story was awful and the plot was terrible, the execution of the plot, even worse. They are out to get rid of the bad people who kill innocent people but leave hundreds of civilians and policemen dead in the wake of their actions. How does that make sense?It fails as a spy movie, it fails as a thriller because there's nothing thrilling about the story, the storyline is far too clunky and jagged. The execution is horrendous. Half the movie goes in backstory and it still feels like it's in the introduction phase, and a bad one at that. Screenplay feels like a parody, consisting of meme-like scenes and lines. There is no character development and what little potential is shown is never really brought to fruition.I understand that a lot of people do like mindless action movie, and I suppose this one does fit the requirements for something like that. However it does feel like a lazy piece of work when you think of the far better potential outcomes that it could have had.

They arent dead but they all faked their death to live an undercover life. You start off in Italy where they are escaping the mafia. They cut out the mafia boss's eye to unlock his phone so they could track down 4 general (bad guys). They found them and killed them all to find out where one of the two brothers whoms dad lead Turkistan. The evil brother came to the throne and locked away the democracy loving brother so he wouldnt have competition. The evil brother was an asshole so the team decided to give him a not so fantastic day. They blew up all statues of him as well as put the nice brother back on the throne and threw the evil one out from a helicopter from like 20 feet so the people of the country could beat him.",

I was not at all surprised when I got to the end credits and realised Michael Bay had directed it, I should have guessed from the nonsensical explosions.I wish someone would tell that man that just because a car crashes, does not mean it will blow up in an explosion so big it looks like a bomb went off.There are a few decent action set pieces, but the vehicular ones are offset by distractingly bad crash test dummies being behind the wheels, and the fight scenes are usually offset by so many jump cuts it's like watching Taken.The characters are over the top caricatures, there are no plot twists or subplots, just the one main story that is in the movie description - billionaire recruits team to take down dictator.This is a film that, on paper, seemed really interesting. It had a pretty good cast, a director who, love him or hate him, has spent his career making vast amounts of money by giving people high octane thrill rides, and a bonkers budget of 150 million.Which it often seems like they blew 100 million of shooting the opening scene.It had the action, but it needed a bit of drama, some real build up of interpersonal relationships, to really elevate it. As it was, I didn't care when any of them were in danger because I don't know anything about them.What was disappointing about this movie is that it had the potential to be so much more. It just needed two things that the Fast and Furious have in spades - a sense of fun, and also a relatable sense of purpose. At it's heart, that series is all about family. If this film had a tangible, relatable through line like that, it would have been much better.",

The actions scenes are pretty fun in places, although the whole premise of kill one bad buy but don't mind sacrificing dozens of innocents makes literally no logical sense what's so ever, nor does the strange lack of authorities intervening while they are effectively blowing up a city for example. But I can accept it's a Bay action movie and so is not exactly one for reality but even so, the cut of this movie is unforgivable and brings the enjoyment factor down several notches as you don't have any idea why your watching what your watching, however spectacular it is.

I don't cry during movies, but this one coaxed a few drops out of my dry, un-crying, man-eyes. Said emotions were brought about by an element of emotion I had yet not experienced. When we talk about gas attacks on Facebook, debating left and right, who really did what, whether or not it was a conspiracy and if it really even happened, we forget about the people that are affected; those who die from these attacks. My first exposure to this was, believe it or not, the campaign of the new Modern Warfare. My first exposure didn't really sink in until I sat back and watched the horror, rather than just playing a game. A man, who couldn't give two s**** about others was suddenly thrust into a moment of danger, where man and character are harshly tested. Instead of saving his own skin like so many of us would do, he stood in the midst of the chaos, lethal chemicals raining from the sky, handing out gas masks for people he didn't even know. I, for sure, have been guilty of being a \"gung-ho\" American. In other words, one who doesn't care about other countries or their peoples, but only for his own country and his own people. After seeing this seen, I remembered my Christianity, a faith I hold so dearly, and the hate disappeared. In its place were tears, tears of the most honest sort. I hate to admit I cried during a movie, but my heart has never gone out to those who suffer more than after watching this movie. Will you have the same experience? Probably not. Besides what it did for me, this movie is truly excellent, and it's sad to see that so many think otherwise. This deserves at least a 7.8, if not a solid 8.That all being said, THIS MOVIE HAS SOME KICKA** ACTION SCENES BABY!!!!!",

This movie has an interesting storyline that is satisfying if not a little too clich\u00e9 but it fine, and if it wasn't for the constant jump cuts that were so overdone this movie would have even been okay, instead I felt like I wasissing half the story. Jump cuts are okay to use during intense scenes to provide us with constant information about the action. Instead in this movie there are jump cuts in almost every scene and due to this the dialogue didn't make much sense, I had a hard time actually keeping up with what was happening because it didn't make sense. The dialogue was written awfully aswell, the jokes didn't land probably because half the joke was cut away. This felt like watching a really long trailer more than a film and was a waste of such a great actor like Ryan Reynolds. I do not recommend watching this movie.",

If you tone down the over the edge action scenes slightly, and make the storyline a bit more believable, thus would be a perfect action movie for me.",

I kept watching it because I thought it was a spoof but people kept taking themselves seriously and doing the most inappropriate/unlogical/non-cultural actions. And seriously, using Abu Dhabi as a background for the capital of a Turkic Country, what a cheat. I hope the Emiraties are not too offended. I would advice not to waste time watching it.
