A movie that deserves to be called \"Mission Impossible!\" Willem Dafoe and Julianne Nicholson both are great. The screenplay writer Tom Flynn gave us a straightforward plot, simple but amazing scenario that has made this movie so suspenseful, thrilling, at the same time, profound. Director Ericson Core also won my praise wholeheartedly. The special effects team did a wonder too, many scenes I just couldn't believe possible to make, but they just looked so real and so powerful. The crossing lake scenes are just ridiculously fascinating. The leading dog's performance is just beyond any word could describe, and the poppy that played Togo's younger age would allow you to understand what \"cute\" really means. Willem Dafoe, what a great actor! Julianne Nicholson, her natural talent completely shinning through the whole movie. Every part of this movie is a fulfilled perfection, it also owes to the great casting job, through the lens of the camera, offering you great cinematography, followed by a perfect editing job....The almost impossible mission, the dogs, the great couple and the great town people...all together, have made this movie THE VERY BEST MOVIE at the year end of 2019.Highly recommended!",

            "content": "I admit it, I'm a sentimentalist. I cried like a baby at my own wedding while my wife looked on in bemusement. I weep at favourite songs or pieces of music and shed tears freely at emotionally charged movies. It was my wife's brother who recommended we watch this movie during lockdown and I really should have read the signs. First off it's a Disney movie, secondly it's about a brave dog ...and right from these two facts, I knew I was going to struggle to get through it dry-eyed.And so it proved. With films like this, for me anyway, critical faculties are suspended and you just want it all to end happily so that you don't have to hide your feelings anymore. I do know that Willem Dafoe and Julianne Nicholson were excellent in their parts as the slightly mismatched couple who set up home in the remote, frozen, northernmost part of America. He's the local \"mush-man\" responsible for trekking his team of husky dogs over unforgiving terrain for the benefit of the local community while she provides all the back-up back home he needs for them both to keep their operation going.Comes a catastrophic diphtheria outbreak to the town, especially targeting young children and the need to requisition urgent medical supplies from some 500 miles or so away, but with an impending spell of bad weather knocking out the possible use of aeroplane or rail transport, the only way to go get the job done is for Dafoe and his dog's to undertake a hazardous cross-country trek like no other to collect the vaccines and get them to the hospital to help save the kids' lives.With a storyline given added topicality and piquancy by the devastating Covid-19 virus outbreak, this was a thrilling and moving race against time, taking on the elements and indeed the odds, the effort spearheaded by crusty old Dafoe and his pack, especially Togo the pack-leading dog. Early on we're fed the back story of how Togo came into the couple's possession and how the dog's irrepressible desire to accompany Dafoe on his travels sees him twice unsuccessfully try to offload the dog to new owners, only for Togo to somehow find a way to break free and return back home from whence he came, Finally Dafoe is persuaded by the dog's errr... doggedness, to reluctantly road-test the apparently under-sized dog and eventually concede that its courage and stamina outweigh any physical disadvantages it may have.We see the pack endure unbelievable dangers in their epic mission, Togo literally pulling out all the stops to navigate the team over breaking ice-floes, slog up snow-bound foot-hills and even save the group from certain doom near the end, in a particularly amazing show of love, strength and fortitude by the dog.It's a Disney film so there's probably a fair bit of dramatic licence taken with the story but you'll have a good idea how it ends. The landscapes, making great use of drone shots on-high are frequently eye-catching and there's was a plaintive lonesome-violin soundtrack which further set the scene. I don't know how much of the cinematography was C-Gen assisted but the actions of the dogs and Togo in particular, looked natural to me.Anyway I got through to the end with some dust in my eyes and immediately afterwards felt the need to hug our own dog of over ten years in sympathy and appreciation for what I'd just seen.This one's for you, Flip.",

It is filled with a lot of heart and backed up by a great performance from Dafoe.Willem Dafoe is really great here. Delivering one of his better movies. His relationship with the dogs is done in such a really nice and heartfelt way. That's what makes it better than most dog films. It's a really enjoyable film and by the end it is really touching. That's thanks to them using a brilliant music choice of \"in the nature of daylight\" as well as the bond and development you get between the Dafoe and Togo.I don't really have any major flaws with it. I think it's a great story especially for not being familiar with the true story. The visual effects aren't always top notch but that's understandable due to being a disney original and a not a cinema film.Overall it's a really solid film, and genuinely the best dog film, we might have ever had, it might not be overly sad but it has heart and thats more than I can ask for coming from a dog film.",

Credit must be given to the filmmakers for the realistic and harrowing portrayal of a dog's tough journey through the brutal Alaskan winter.

Those are good in their own right, but this 2019 film - which is about a true story - takes things to another dimension.It tugs at the heartstrings profusely, from the first scene to the very last. It's superbly written, with there being a fair amount of surprises in terms of how the story unfolds. It's shot beautifully and put together, via the set design etc., excellently, while the score is magnificent.Then you have the dogs, who are insanely charming throughout - especially, of course, the star that is Togo (Diesel). There's many a moment with him that produce all the feelings, from joy to sorrow to everything in between. The dogs are great and incredibly adorable.Away from all of that, you have an outstanding performance from Willem Dafoe. Before seeing this, the most I remember of him is his role in 'Mr. Bean's Holiday'. This now takes over in those regards, it's a brilliant job done by Dafoe. Julianne Nicholson merits praise, also.What a film. Not what I was expecting whatsoever, in the nicest possible way. Glad to see it has also been highly rated online. A must-watch!",

Despite that the story is simple, it has plenty of suspense and does not let you be calm through its whole duration, something that I found extraordinary. Willem Dafoe's interpretation as Leonhard Seppala helped on that since he was simply outstanding. The flashbacks were also very helpful for the character building and also helped us understand the bond between Togo and Leonhard Seppala, and how it was created. Some other interpretations that have to be mentioned were Julianne Nicholson's who played as Constance Seppala and Christopher Heyerdahl's who played as Mayor George Maynard.

And my eyes almost roll at how predictable its likely to be and because so often this type of film is just clever marketing trick to evoke audience emotion (eg Marley and Me) without nuance and when you step back you feel a bit duped even though you may have guiltily enjoyed the ride. However, Togo is one of those rare films that tows this line extra carefully and makes sure that the emotional rollercoaster is warranted and justified within the context of the story and is done in a meaningful and organic way. A big part of what helps it achieve this is knowing that this film is based on historical events, a real journey and a real dog, so you trust in the organicness and can invest in the characters without feeling you're being led to emotionally exploitation solely for a film studios purse. It is such a beautiful tale also with edge of your seat stuff action, but most importantly there is so much heart and depth and meaningful messages to be taken from it that is perfect for children and families. I'm sure this is an instant classic in many households and will endure for many years to come I am sure.",

Its action is an odd mix of real-life animal work and CGI set-pieces. However, its overall formalistic effect isn't entirely unsuccessful. It never comes close to feeling realistic but it evokes the effect it's going for. Some of it's actually suspenseful. The story isn't the most compelling, though it does have a good set-up and proper stakes. It just doesn't grip you, exactly. It's well-written but generally dry. A lot of it is just characters talking about how good its eponymous dog is. The relationship between the dog and his owner is tangible, though. The movie is entertaining enough throughout. Its overdone ending isn't the best note to go out on, but the experience is fairly enjoyable nevertheless. 6/10",

            "content": "(Togo 4 out of 5 stars).Togo is a good adventure true story about Togo a leader husky of a dog sled. Where they travel hundred of miles to get medicine for a small town in Alaska. Facing against the harsh weather and a race against time to save kids who are sick with an epidemic illness. Its a great story. Togo was a stubborn and frustrating pup when Leonhard (Willem Dafoe) and wife Constance (Julianne Nicholson) first had him. Leonhard was a strict dog owner. No dogs on bed. He has huskies trained for a sled. Togo was always eager to be part of the sled. He would escape the dog pen or barn to interfere when Leonhard was out with his sled. When an epidemic sickness is infecting all the kids. The nearest town with medicine is 600 miles away. They organize a relay sledding team to transport the medicine. Which Leonhard and his sled led by Togo travel hundreds of miles to get the medicine to bring it back.The direction and script kept the movie moving at a fast pace. Putting Leonhard right into action with his travels. Facing against storms. A frozen lake cap. And edgy mountain trails. While the film flashes 12 years earlier to focus on Togos earlier years as a troublemaking puppy. Which was also fun and cute. The film has a thrilling and edge of your seat adventure sequences. While giving the audience a break throughout with flashing back to the earlier years with Leonhard not happy with the troublemaking Togo.Willem Dafoe and Julianne Nicholson are great with their characters. I have to say this is probably one of the best dog movies ever. With great acting. Good story. Exciting thrills. The setting was spectacular on capturing the beautiful landscape of Alaska and the snowy mountains.Ericson Core direction was great. He did great in setting up the action. Literally having us gripping the seat when Leonhard is riding the sled up on the mountains. And barely keeping on the edge. Or racing against the frozen lakes that are breaking into pieces. That scene was spectacular. The music score by Mark Isham was also good as well. The film does show a bond and friendship between Togo and Leonhard. And it can be emotional at times.Overall, Togo is a good film. If your looking for an exciting adventure film about a guy racing against time on a dog sled. This is worth checking out.",

            "content": "Togo is a drama film based on the true story of the important people and dogs involved in the 1925 Alaskan serum run. Starring Willem Dafoe in the lead role, it is an inspiring tale of the relationship between humans and canines through the most challenging of hardships.In 1925, an outbreak of diphtheria develops in the Alaskan town of Nome, causing several young children to become seriously ill. In response to this, the mayor of Nome tasks sled dog musher Leonhard Seppala (Willem Dafoe) with traversing through the state to collect a serum and race back as quickly as possible. In spite of the serious snowy conditions, Seppala and his team of Siberian Huskies, led by the energetic, high-spirited Togo, set forth on this dangerous mission, determined to make it back with the serum no matter what.With its great use of landscape and solid acting, Togo goes above and beyond the normal human and dog bonding story to become an exhilarating adventure decades in the making. Throughout the film, we are constantly reminded of the loyalty and resilience of the Siberian Husky known as Togo, who always defies the odds in spite of his physical limitations. It was just so touching to watch as Togo trudges on through the harsh snowstorms and dangerous terrain, proving himself a valuable sled dog to his master Leonhard. Dogs truly are man's best friend and films like this serve to further emphasise this to us all.Director Ericson Core frequently uses creative wide open cinematography to show off how expansive the Alaskan scenery actually is. This helps give the feeling of how much ground Leonhard, Togo, and the rest of the sled team must cover in order to complete their mission in time. In addition to this, certain scenes kept me on the edge of my seat. One in particular involved the team travelling over ice sheets, as the cracking thin ice felt like it could break apart at any moment, reminding us that there is no time for procrastination.As per usual, Willem Dafoe gives a reliably strong performance in the main human role as Leonhard Seppala. Dafoe depicts Seppala with a stern yet caring demeanor, which according to some sources, was how he genuinely was in real life. Of course, the real star is Diesel, the Siberian Husky who plays the title dog himself. Not only is he absolutely adorable when he wants to be, but the stunts he pulls off are wonderful to watch as well. These dog breeds are known for their loyalty and companionship and it was nice to see this shown off in such a loving fashion.Overall, if you love dogs just as much as I do, then this film is well worth your time. Even if you believe you have seen all movies involving heroic dogs, this one still may have enough surprises to keep you invested. As previously stated, dogs are man's best friend and it never hurts to be reminded of this.I rate it 8.5/10",

Importantly, it corrects history in a really effective way.Has instantly become my favourite performance and role of Willem Dafoe. He was great. Julianne Nicholson was excellent as his gentle, kindhearted wife. Diesel's performance as Togo should also ensure he join the likes of Benji in the dog-acting hall of fame. The film really excels at making the viewer feel as if Togo was their own - while also reminding viewers of every loyal dog they've ever had in life.The cinematography and scenery was breathtaking - literally. Has been a while since a film made me feel so cold! It's both a beautiful (and sometimes brutal) film to watch. The ice scenes were a definite standout.Togo is the perfect film to watch with your dog. In 2011, Time Magazine listed Togo as the most heroic dog of all-time. That should be enough for anyone to watch this excellent Disney film. Hopefully this is a sign of good things to come for Disney Originals!",

Whether it's continuing Toy Story or making tons of live-action versions of their animated films, audiences, although flocking our to see them, don't seem to be all that impressed. With the exception of their franchise in The Marvel Cinematic Universe, I really can't see a new franchise blossoming for them anytime soon, unless you count the fact that they now own Avatar. My point is that it's always nice to see them take on an original film and Togo is their latest live-action original to be released, but this time by their streaming service, Disney Plus. Is it worth watching? Absolutely.Without giving anything away for those who haven't heard the real story, Togo tells the opposing story to Disney's 1995 film Balto. Known as the 1925 serum run, Togo follows Leonhard Seppala (Willem Dafoe) and his sled dogs as they travel through impossible conditions to retrieve medicine for a hospital with dying children. This is the core premise of the movie, but it's also equally about the bond between owner and dog. This film will have fans of both animals and drama tearing up. I thoroughly enjoyed my experience with this movie.Although it doesn't do anything new for films like this, it adds a depth of emotion that most of them are devoid of. Willem Dafoe, although not giving an award-winning performance by any means, remains committed from beginning to end. I found myself attached to these dogs, due to the love that was very clearly coming off of him. On top of that, there are some great visuals for a film that wasn't released in theatres. Disney Plus is clearly trying to release some quality content on their streaming service.In the end, Togo is a great film to watch with families around the holidays, so I believe those who have subscribed to their service will be enjoying this one very much this year. For the classics, Star Wars and Marvel content, I can definitely recommend signing up for this service, but I believe purchasing a month of this service just for this movie will even make you happy. It's a great feel-good story, even though it does delve into some sad elements. There's not much else to say about this movie. It's very well-made and emotionally satisfying. I absolutely recommend checking it out.",

For myself personally, I love a \"real life\" movie. I liked the pace and the story telling and how it would do flash backs and explain the characters. I never knew the true story of the 1925 Serum run to Nome Until watching this. I've heard of Balto before but never Togo. I was pleasantly surprised that this movie was almost 100% accurate to the real life events. Very enjoyable movie!",

I think it's because they said just enough about his past to leave the rest of his character to the imagination, making everyone's opinion the dog the correct opinion.I was desperate that they did not spoil the film with a poor ending but Disney hit a home run with this one.

Wayyyyy too smart for what they showed. It was just poorly written. They could have focused on other things to make it stronger. Too many shots of the dogs running and the scenes became too repetitive. The acting didn't help either. I'm so tired of Hollywood actors forcing expressions and words to manipulate the audience should feel. Let the audience decide how we should feel by just showing the story. People in real life don't behave like that unless they are kids or liars trying to manipulate someone.Togo was more annoying than anything for them to have kept him.

Why hide it, at the end there was a lump in my throat, although I didn't get to those waterfalls that flowed after watching \"Hachiko\" (both times, by the way). As a dedication to the amazing brotherhood of man and dog; as a tribute to an animal that lived all these years in the shadow of Balto, although it deserved much more honors; as a love letter to our four-legged friends and as a beautiful Disney adventure for the whole family, the film is an undeniable success. Therefore, only a certain amount of critical masochism compels me to write the second paragraph. For a story about the full danger of traveling through a blizzard to save the lives of dozens of children, \"Togo\" seemed surprisingly boring to me. Despite the entertaining shooting technique, the action scenes as such did not work out. The music of Mark Isham also failed, as if on purpose to dilute any tension as much as possible with life-affirming melodies. The script still couldn't start, interrupting the whole narrative at first with cute, but then frankly protracted flashbacks, and then suddenly it somehow took off and ended. There was no big finale, no turning point, no heroes frozen on the edge of the abyss, no last spurt to victory. The quest to save precious lives somehow smoothly slid into the drama that started it all, and I went to put the kettle on, realizing that there was still half an hour left before the end of the film. While Willem Dafoe gleefully displays all of his Oscar-nominated dramatic abilities, the film isn't named after him, after all.",

Although Togo did a fantastic job, the scene on the ice was terrifying well done, he did not got the credit. It was Balto. But in our hearts, Togo stays the best dog: ever !\nUnbelievable performance of Willem Dafoe. Please, watch the movie with your kids. It is worthwhile your time",

Then he gets to thinking if his purpose is something else.This movie isn't advertised at all. The first thing I saw of it was a small little advertisement in the corner of the IMDb page. I think if they told more people it was coming, maybe some more people would have bought Disney plus. I bet many dog lovers would love this movie and from what I have seen, critics have also been saying it is pretty solid. I have to say I like it too. These are the type of movies Disney needs to put on their streaming channel. From what I remember they might too! I thought William Dafoe gave a pretty solid performance. I always thought people under looked him as an actor but I have been starting to realize that many people enjoy watching him in films. All of the other actor did a great job in this picture. In my mind, it was just William Dafoe with a bunch of dogs. For the whole runtime of the film I was always in aw while looking at the ice breaking, or the snow covered mountains, or even just a patch of trees. It looked really beautiful. It looked like someone went out into Alaska and took pictures of a bunch of mountains, ice, and trees. That is how great it looked. I thought the lighting wasn't the best. It was pretty dark and at some scenes hard to see. There were also some flashbacks that pretty much came out of nowhere. In my mind, those were small problems.Overall, I really enjoyed watching Togo. I would recommend it if you have Disney Plus at the moment.",

I really thought the flashbacks were a nice touch throughout the film as it broke up the journey to tell the whole story inbetween.

He was devoted to Dad.Dad had firm views on his dogs and would not let us treat them as pets (no patting of dogs), and like in the film (no dogs in the bedroom) Dad's dogs were never allowed into our house. They were cared for and trained but not pampered at all.At one time Dad had to have major surgery and was away from the farm for weeks and when he returned he was bedridden for months. During that time Tim fretted and eventually stopped eating entirely. Mum was concerned and tried to coax Tim into the house to see Dad but Tim wouldn't enter the house. So my elder brother picked him up and carried him into my parent's bedroom. Dad was able to put his hand out of the bed and reassure Tim with a pat on his head. Tim licked Dad's hand and wagged his tail and then went straight outside and ate his food. Dad eventually recovered.Some dogs are amazing.

            "content": "Because Togo is definitely worth the channel! At my age, I grew up with Disney movies and parks. Togo is, absolutely, a throwback to the great movies made when Walt Disney was CEO of the studio. Willem Dafoe was a perfect choice to play the lead character and Julieanne Nicholson was absolutely wonderful as his wife. Togo is a movie based on a true story about the Diptheria outbreak in Nome, Alaska, in 1925 and the dog sled race to get medicine from another city 600 plus miles away back to Nome to save the children of this small town. This movie has so much heart and soul, it's a rare gem in the movie world today.In reality, it's about the love between a man and his dog that takes twelve years to discover. I loved everything about Togo. The acting, the humor, the scenery, the cinematography, the directing, the heart, and especially the dogs used to portray these sled dogs of the 1920s in Alaska were of the highest degree I have seen in a long time. Because of Togo's age (12) and the difficulties of the trip that ended up being almost 300 miles in the middle of one of the worst storms ever seen up to that time in the area they had to travel, the very last leg of the Journey was run by a dog named Balto, who was nationally hailed as the hero of the Journey. In reality, it was Togo who saved the children with his amazing strength and love of his man, but was too ill to make the final run to Nome.I have had and loved and lost many wonderful dogs in my lifetime, so I admit that I cried nonstop in the last 15 minutes of this movie. But be aware, the ending isn't as sad as I thought it would be. It was absolutely a perfect ending to a perfect story in a perfect movie. I would give this movie a 15 if it went that high. One of my top 20 favorite movies I have seen in my lifetime. To say I highly recommend it, is an understatement. You can now bundle Hulu and Disney Plus together and save $7 a month, which is what we did as a gift for my daughter's family for Christmas. However, I have already watched more of the movies and shows on Disney than they have at this point. Do yourselves a favor and watch this wonderful movie. There is nothing boring or whatever negative thing I read in a couple reviews here at all. If you have a heart, you will love this movie!!",

            "content": "\"Harnessed to your Heart\". Such a beautiful film with a wonderful performance by Willem Dafoe, who plays Leonhard Seppala, who raised Huskies in the Alaskan Wilderness. History tells us of the great serum run in 1925, but Balto was the dog honored on the last leg, the final 55 miles, and that's the one remembered. Within that run was a 264 mile round trip led by a dog considered too small and too old to do the job. But, Seppela knew otherwise, hence the basis for the film Togo about a forgotten dog that Time Magazine called the 'greatest animal hero of all time'(2011). Shot in a way to give us the loneliness of that era is the story of frustration with a mischievous puppy that turns into an incredible bond of love and loyalty. Dafoe is in his element here with a character that plays to both strengths and weaknesses. Add to that a subtle but haunting score from Mark Isham and guarantee you will be in tears by the time Seppala says the words \"harnessed to your heart\". A monumental achievement for Disney +.",

It's not the sadness of death because that is inevitable; but the sadness of missing THAT companionship. The companionship that many develop with their furry friend. The companionship that is shown in Togo. Even the guilt that Willem character feels when Togo looks like he might not make it brings back guilt felt afterwards.\nThis is a wonderfully shot film with beautiful shots of Alaska and the serenity and brutality of the Alaskan wilderness during the 1920's. There were times where it looked like it was a painted backdrop or the green screen CGI looked off. I don't know how much of this version of the story of Togo is true but if it did happen; there's a legitimate reason why this dog, companion, friend, was celebrated throughout Alaska and the sled dog world.\nA great movie for the family",

All the constant cracking of the ice (hooray for CGI) as he and his dog team raced across the bay was so CGI-overladen that it positioned itself alongside the plethora of like films which over-use CGI to such an extent as to lose all sense of realness. Especially the scene where the lead dog Togo stop inches away from a huge precipice after an out-of-control rush down an implausibly steep mountainside, this was just so unreal(istic.\nOdd also that throughout the hour or so I watched of the film not once did Dafoe feed his dogs, which seems a huge error.\nThe obvious play of emotion using children likely to die of diphtheria was again so Hollywood, and let's face it there are few films out of Hollywood which approach anything like believable. FIlms of course are about imagination, creativity, adventure, etc, but instinct tells me before the words come into my head that a film is just not crafted well enough so as to persuade me and carry me along in its\nstory.\nSad that a great, inspirational story didn't attract the right director who could have honoured it by making an inspiring, believable film.",

            "content": "As someone who was a huge fan of the film \"Balto\" as a young child, I was thrilled when I heard about the impending release of this movie. For a long time I've wanted a live-action, historically accurate film about the events of the serum run, and this did not disappoint!The plot of this movie mainly focuses on the life of Togo (hence the title) and his career as a sled dog, as well as his unparalleled devotion to his owner, Leonard Seppala, who doubted his abilities as a working dog during his earlier years. Togo received little recognition for the major role he played in saving Nome from the diphtheria epidemic, and this film spared no expense in showing us what sacrifices were made by both him and his musher to save the lives of others. On top of the strong emotions this movie makes you feel, it also delivers a bit of comedy which was unexpected, but very amusing!I couldn't help but feel nostalgic from the various \"Balto\" references, which weren't surprising since this is the same story. I was very impressed with the nod to the original film when they recreated the scene where the sled team had slid down a steep mountain slope, stopping themselves just before falling over the edge of a cliff. Balto makes a few cameo appearances towards the end, but more so for the purpose of \"de-throaning\" him by pointing out that he, by a twist of fate, ended up taking the credit for saving Nome when it had been mainly Togo (and over 100 other dogs) who all played an important role. By the end of the film, I was nearly tearing up because of how touching the final scene was as a tribute to Togo's life, as well as the epilogue and photo before the end credits.This movie made me laugh, it made me cry. It was the long-awaited re-telling of this remarkable story of the serum run we've needed for almost 100 years. Togo is finally recognized for the hero that he is. It is one of the best and bravest things that humans and animals have ever done!",

The film flits between present day and flashbacks, nicely building up the central bond between Seppala and Togo - recounting his mischievous puppy years in which the musher tried to give him away twice(!), to him finding his heroic place leading the pack. It's a beautiful bond that will undoubtedly melt the iciest of hearts; you know what they say about the purest love being between grumpy dads and the pets they said they didn't want!\nCore brings the impressive feat of dog and human endurance to life with gorgeously sweeping wide shots framing the beautiful, but often deadly, vistas of Northern Alaska. The action was suspenseful and tense, coupled with an overwhelming use of icy blues and an endless white that transported you into the rough terrain. The only downside to the film was the at times small-screen feel about it, particularly when scenes took place in the towns.",

Not really a sad story, but definitely wasted potential for the movie, considering the Top tier actor named Willem Dafoe they hired for the main role, the euthanasia scene would've been so well delivered.

It's just an entertaining movie with that very clear Disney flavor in top of it. It lacked anything that gave a sense of realism. It was all about that Disney emotion. In my view you then didn't do justice to the real story. It makes me even wonder how much of it is real. Not bad, but nothing special either. Nice Christmas movie though.

It also would have made it so that MUCH of the $40million budget wasn't wasted on needless CGI... and perhaps that money could then have been spent on making the film slightly longer (which I think it would have really benefited from since the film actually ends very abruptly after the serum run is completed).But otherwise, it's a very good true-story movie and captures a pretty important historical moment during the diphtheria outbreak in 1925 Alaska. Willem Dafoe delivers some great acting throughout.Overall, it's a great true-story movie and certainly worth a watch. 8/10.",

The most famous team was the one that actually delivered the serum, lead by Fox and Balto, the latter dog Balto of course receiving all the fame. This movie is a reminder that it was Seppala's team led by the incredible Togo that vastly outdistanced all of them.The film begins with the outbreak of the Nome epidemic with Togo an established and senior dog of 12 years old and uses flashbacks to recount his early years and all the trouble they had with this unruly, smallish but lightning fast and amazingly intelligent puppy. His destiny was to lead the sled team and lead it he did. Can anyone possibly imagine the heart the dog must have had at that age to guide a sled team in such conditions and for such a distance. It's incredible when you realize it actually happened.A thoroughly enjoyable family film depicting the real story of courage and heart.

However, when you dig a bit more and read accounts from diaries of mushers and families whose children lived (and thus generations of families) because of Seppala and Togo's heroism, you see the real truth. Without those two, their speed and tenacity, the serum simply would not have made it to Nome. This film, tells the truth in a way that is utterly heartwarming without being syrupy and \"Disney-ish.\" I've always admired Dafoe, but he gives a wonderfully understated performance that draws you into the story as if you were there watching it all in person. A beautiful, triumphant film that reminds you that the will of a spirit and heart can truly make miracles happen. As an aside, puppy Togo is about the most adorable creature I've ever seen!!",

It is a straightforward story that tugs at the heart strings. It also has realistic and meaningful characters. In particular, it has a wife who actually behaves like the wives I know and see.The acting is good. The scenery is excellent. The camera work is mostly very good. The dogs are loveable. I really enjoyed seeing Julianne Nicholson play the role of the wife. She worked with her husband (which is rare to see in films today). She complimented her husband well, although it would have been good if she had at least one fault. Willem Dafoe delivered his usual solid performance and he's a pleasure to watch. He plays strong and flawed well.I enjoyed watching this film. It is probably a little better suited to my children. Definitely worth a watch. Netflix is hit and miss. This is definitely on the hit side, although, not as risk taking (and politics free) as Klaus. Klaus stands as my Netflix goto kids film.",

This movie features some really solid performances, with Willem Dafoe being the standout, as is usually the case. If you like dogs, definitely watch this movie! It has cute dogs everywhere, and I think they are mostly real with minimal CGI. I'm always amazed at how expressive these animals can be and what they can be trained to do. The subject matter of the movie was very interesting, I feel like I learned something about history from watching it. It also features some really intense and thrilling action sequences that had me on the edge of my seat! I wasn't that into the structure of the film, it was told in a nonlinear way that kinda took me out of the experience sometimes. That, and I didn't think the cinematography or the editing were anything to write home about, but other than that this is a good movie that gives you a good old-fashioned triumphant feeling.

Enjoy that they chose not to voice over Togo (the sled dog) always find that tacky. Only real gripe with the film is it seems to contradict the story told in earlier Disney pretrails of the story in Balto.. without some serious reading it's hard to tell which story stays more true to the real events... Seems like typical Disney re writing history even its own to fit it's needs, but besides that a great watch, obviously family friendly but didn't feel forced, definitely be watching this again soon!",

First off, I have no idea how they were able to train those dogs to act the way they did in that movie, that in my mind, was pretty incredible. Based on the film making and the movie as a whole, I would consider it a masterpiece. The storyline had a perfect blend between timelines that came together to tell the story of Togo in an amazing way. I was able to understand this dogs life and the life of the owners ever since he was a pup. The story from 1925 in general was incredible just to see. How 20 teams in this \"serum run\" ran the relay, where all of them ran 31 miles except for one of them running 264. I personally, love historic movies and this one came second to none. I'm not sure how accurate it was, but they made it seem that Balto, the dog that finished the \"serum run\" was the villain because the press praised him instead of Togo. Personally, that iritates me off a little, but I could care less because this movie was a 10/10. It's frustrating that this movie is only on Disney+, I would like to see it released in theaters and find out how other critics and just normal movie goers think of the movie. The conclusion and ending to this movie was nothing but excellent. The sound editing between the breathing of the dogs, running, thoughts from the owner (Willem Dafoe), who did such an incredible job in this one I personally think this is his best movie. The ending of the movie was so touching it was incredible. It's sometimes hard to explain how good this movie is, you'll just have to see it yourself to believe me. But, I guarantee, you do not want to pass up seeing this film.",

Yet another very good role of Defo, which was not surprising at all.Sound and camera work are superb, script and dialogues are very good too - simple, clean and without any useless thing to get extra minutes.It also shows how the media works - Balto gets all the credits while the real hero stays in the shadows unknown for over 50 years. Not that Balto and his owner are not heroes as well, don't get me wrong, i'm just paying my respect where it's due.",

            "content": "I admit it, I'm a sentimentalist. I cried like a baby at my own wedding while my wife looked on in bemusement. I weep at favourite songs or pieces of music and shed tears freely at emotionally charged movies. It was my wife's brother who recommended we watch this movie during lockdown and I really should have read the signs. First off it's a Disney movie, secondly it's about a brave dog ...and right from these two facts, I knew I was going to struggle to get through it dry-eyed.And so it proved. With films like this, for me anyway, critical faculties are suspended and you just get caught up in the action and want it all to end happily, especially for the dogs. I do know that Willem Dafoe and Julianne Nicholson were excellent in their parts as the slightly mismatched couple who set up home in the remote, frozen, northernmost part of America. He's the local \"mush-man\" responsible for trekking his team of husky dogs over unforgiving terrain for the benefit of the local community while she provides all the back-up back home he needs for them both to keep their operation going.Comes a catastrophic diphtheria outbreak to the town, especially targeting young children and the need to requisition urgent medical supplies from some 500 miles or so away, but with an impending spell of bad weather knocking out the possible use of aeroplane or rail transport, the only way to go get the job done is for Dafoe and his dogs to undertake a hazardous cross-country trek like no other to collect the vaccines and get them back to the hospital to help save the kids' lives.With a storyline given added topicality and piquancy by the devastating Covid-19 virus outbreak, this was a thrilling and moving race against time, taking on the elements and indeed the odds, the effort spearheaded by crusty old Dafoe and his pack, especially Togo the pack-leading dog. Early on we're fed the back story of how Togo came into the couple's possession and how the dog's irrepressible desire to accompany Dafoe on his travels sees him twice unsuccessfully try to offload the dog to new owners, only for Togo to somehow find a way to break free and return back home from whence he came. Finally Dafoe is persuaded by the dog's errr... doggedness, to reluctantly road-test the apparently under-sized dog and eventually concede that its courage and stamina outweigh any physical disadvantages it may have.We see the pack endure unbelievable dangers in their epic mission, Togo literally pulling out all the stops to navigate the team over breaking ice-floes, slog up snow-bound foot-hills and even save the group from certain doom near the end, in a particularly amazing show of love, strength and fortitude by the dog.It's a Disney film so there's probably a fair bit of dramatic licence taken with the story but you'll have a good idea how it ends. The landscapes, making great use of drone shots on-high are frequently eye-catching and there's was a plaintive lonesome-violin soundtrack which further set the scene. I don't know how much of the cinematography was C-Gen assisted but the actions of the dogs and Togo in particular, looked natural to me.Anyway I got through to the end dry-eyed and dog-tired, to quote Elvis Costello, and immediately afterwards felt the need to hug our own dog of over ten years in sympathy and appreciation for what I'd just seen.This one's for you, Flip.",

I grew up watching George Attla and Dr. Roland Lumbard compete with 8 and 7 world championships, respectively. Togo exaggerated the drama of the ice flow breaking up, but they always do in Hollywood. Willem Defoe carried the entire weight of the cast with his commanding charisma. The rest of the cast might as well have stayed home. All except Togo. Love this movie.",

Living in Nome Alaska in 1925 would be like living in hell for most of us, but it still shines with beauty - the mountains, the ice and oceans. The story was interesting and I learned much about the illnesses that struck then and dog sledding. The acting from the dogs was the best I've seen in a Disney film. And Dafoe fit the mold of a Norwegian immigrant to Alaska. No movie is perfect so I only give it a 9, as there are SOME boring parts I suppose.",

And what's up with the weird blurry letterbox and digitally added pixel noise?? It's awful and just made the film unbearable to watch. The soundtrack is just an annoying violin playing the same 3 notes for the entire movie. And I haven't even started on the story...For me the story was painstakingly predictable and just boring, it felt like the entire film was the exact same scene with different dialogue options. Not a single character was actually interesting and the flashbacks are unnecessary. I didn't feel a connection with any of the characters and therefore the movie never really touched me.As the titel says... I've seen some great and fun films that don't get the praise this film does. And it feels like a lot of people are just biased because they liked the story before they even made it into a movie. It's certainly not a \"bad\" film but it's also not nearly worth the solid 8 it has at the time of writing this review.",

And then Willem Dafoe's face came up on the screen and I was like \"Okay, you had my interest, but now you have my attention.\" The film struck the right balance between moments of suspense, heartwarming scenes, funny moments where Togo is being a mischievous pup, and the few scenes that had me vigorously wiping away my tears before anyone could see. It wasn't too heavy handed in any of these areas, in my opinion, and I appreciated the history lesson that came with it. I also appreciated that it had an overall happy ending. I generally refuse to watch animal movies because they piss me off when something happens to the animal, but this ending had us walking away feeling happier and more connected to our own mischievous pups than before we started watching.

            "content": "I've seen Togo a few times, and I love it. It's based entirely on the excellent story of Togo, a sled dog with intelligence, stamina, courage, and, most importantly, heart, and his crucial part in saving Nome, Alaska from a horrible diphtheria epidemic. Togo looks almost exactly like he did in real life, except for the eyes. Willem Dafoe is excellent in the role of Togo's musher, the famed Leonhard Seppala, and delivers so many funny lines (\"Next time I go the wrong way, you tell me to go to h***!\")! The story is very touching and amazing at the same time!!!! And most importantly, this movie delivers a heartwarming message that even when loyal dogs leave you, they'll stay harnessed to your heart until the day you leave this world behind! It also acknowledges that while the press gave the credit to the final team's lead dog, Balto, and his musher, Gunnar Kaasen (since they actually brought the medicine into Nome), and Balto even received his own statue in New York (which I visited), Togo will always be remembered as the true savior of Nome, since he lead Seppala and his team across the most dangerous bit of the serum run.Overall, Togo is a remarkable improvement over Amblimation's 1995 animated box office disappointment, Balto, which was far too mean-spirited and riddled with uncanny animation and historical lies, including violent and scary moments that never happened. I can't believe Steven Spielberg would subject kids to something like that!!!! Balto's only redeeming factor was probably its music (the late, great James Horner's thunderous score and Steve Winwood's gorgeous, inspirational blue-eyed soul ballad, \"Reach For The Light\"). Avoid Balto, but Togo is a compulsory viewing.",

The feat itself is truly incredible. There are no words, Togo is one of a kind. You may have heard of Balto? Well, this film is a historical correction of immense proportions. Turns out, Balto only ran 20 miles of the 640+ mile \"great serum run\" as it is known. This film is an emotional rollercoaster - it's fun, exciting, heartwarming and just what you need right now (trust me).Secondly, the acting, cinematography and cgi are amazing. Ok, this film is all about the dog, and what a powerful film it is, but I truly did not expect the visual feast that was scent (couldn't resist) my way. It's astounding what can be done these days.And of course, no film review would be complete without a mention of the soundtrack. It's good. Really good. And features some recognisable music (Arrival anyone?)It isn't very often that a film really moves me to want to tell the entire world about it. But I feel this film is such an underrated movie; I'd never heard of it before seeing it in the rolling promotion carousel on Disney+, and let's be honest, neither had you. And, like me, you'd probably never even heard the name Togo before. But you have now and all I can say is this film is full of heart and packs a powerful punch and is really deserving of a watch. And yes, it's very family friendly.So after you've watched it, if you're anything like me, when the credits start rolling, you might find yourself heading to Wikipedia to find out more (sorry it's the inner geek in me!) and believe me, you won't be disappointed.Watch it and thank me later.",

They figured out everything quickly. There was always a quick solution. I never felt like they could not have done it. I never felt the failure so they can come back with determination, passion and ambition. Everything was too quick yet the movies is really boring.He did not accept the dog at first since he was a bit too playful and moving. However, one day he accepts him suddenly.The script is too poor. I just watched the movie yet I dont even remember any quotes from the movie besides Dafoe saying \"Good dogs!\"The story could have been told from a different perspective, so it is not always \"Togo, Togo\"\nThe scenerio could have been much more emphatic, powerful, and uncertain.

This is a beautiful story about bravery, determination and risking all because it's the right thing to do and not in an attempt at glory.\nI cried alot during the movie and now thinking of it I'm crying too. It's that touching and moving.\nTo think these two characters did what they did and aren't both immortalized with a statue or something is just inexplicable.\nThis film also taught me about a certain breed of dog that came into existence because of the real Togo.\nWillem Dafoe proves again he's the European definition of actor, a true artist.\nI was also relieved to see such a strong female character! Finally! I always admire these type of women that people often overlook or don't appreciate because she's a wife, a friend, a homemaker and a man's driving force.\nAnd many times throughout the film her husband talks about her in a way you can tell there's alot of respect and admiration for her even when he says she's stubborn it's a compliment trust me!\nWhat a beautiful marriage.\nThe wife is also fundamental to the story in different ways not just as the man's safe haven from the world. But I can't explain why without giving away the story.\nThat dog... one in a million. To be lucky enough to have had a dog like that must be extraordinary.\nI almost didn't watch this film because my mind was comparing this to 2 other movies \"snow dogs\" with Cuba Gooding Jr and that Paul Walker film \"Eight Below\". Thankfully I ignored my mind's comparisons. This film is more in tune with \"Eight below\" but it's in a very different tone. I liked \"Eight below\" alot and \"Togo\" too.\nThis film requires your full attention because it jumps from one time to another. One minute you're seeing Togo as a pup the next Togo is struggling for survival. It doesn't confuse you if you're paying attention and it's also an interesting way of telling the story.\nI didn't give it 10 stars because of a few scenes I don't agree with that have no relevance whatsoever to the story but were added for the reasons I don't agree with and I can't say what or this website will censor me and also other than that, this movie is a must.",

And it is almost 100 years ago this took place.The purpose of the film was to portray a story and the connection between man and canine, and I believe it did so perfectly. The last 30 minutes of the film i was crying on and off.The camerawork is excellent, as is the acting. The whole film except for one particular part (that was added for excitement) feels genuine and believable.So in relation to what the purpose of this movie was, its deserves at least 9/10.\nEveryone that has ever owned a dog will love this movie.

I liked the Screenplay more and its neat along with all Technical aspects.\nBut I have one big worry about the movie on its release. They not released it in theatres and Worldwide, making the movie not popular and unknown for most of them is Major Drawback. Since My request will not be received by any crew members of the team but I here say heartfully that, to kindly release the film Worldwide in Theatres and don't make the movie worthless\nVerdict : Must Watch Excellent movie\nBest scene : (1st time to present this column Togo made me to do it) When Seppela thought that Togo is Happy while Hiking as lead dog but later realizes Walking with him is important for Togo that's what makes him happy, where Loyalty lies on his Owner ( My eyes got Wet on that scene as well as Seppela had while seeing Togo sitting on a Ridge)",

            "content": "There are the mildest of spoilers in the following review - for any who would prefer a completely unspoiled viewing experience I'll just say go watch the movie - quick!Like many, I swallowed the story of Balto being the hero of the Fairbanks to Nome desperation dog-sled Serum Run, and though I knew Balto didn't lead the only team on this heroic 600 mile journey, I had no idea that another team, lead by another dog and driven by another musher had gone 264 miles, including crossing a trecherous frozen sound - twice - while the other 19 teams averaged 31 miles. (The Balto team completed the final 55 miles, which was heroic enough, but as the team that arrived with the life-saving diptheria serum, Balto got to be the hero. Ironically, Leonhard Seppala was the owner of both Balto and Togo, but Seppala wanted the best dogs on the longest and most treacherous part of the journey and Balto didn't make the \"first team.\"As a story, it's exhilarating, but the acting and cinematography and other elements such as costuming and editing and music all add up to by far the best \"dog movie\" I've seen. Playing Leonhard and Constance Seppala are Willem Dafoe and Julianne Nicholson are excellent actors and they have real chemistry with each other and with the dogs. Drones and other innovative techniques are used to capture brilliant \"live\" footage with what I assume must have included some CGI shots for the harrowing journey across Norton Sound, which I don't doubt was breaking up in real life - I learned that the movie gets this part right: the ice had completely broken up and floated out to see the next morning.I'm a little curious: The real Seppala's had a daughter who was 8 and living with them in Nome. For some reason she is not shown or mentioned and there is even a scene where Constance is questioning Leonhard's motivation for making this death-defying run, during which Leonhard explains that they know several of these children and their parents. Since all three household members, but especially young Sigrid, were vulnerable in an isolated town in the midst of a raging diphtheria epidemic with no other cures available, I'm just a little curious why this wasn't depicted in the film.",

You know this is one of Defoe's best acting performances ever,\nbecause it does not feel like he is acting.\nJulianne Nicholson is perfect as Seppala's wife and her facial expressions make you feel what she is feeling.\nThe writing by Tom Flynn is just wonderful. For instance, when Seppala declares, \"He's (Togo) not a sled dog, he's a lead dog!\"\nThe music by Mark Isham arouses your emotions. And will make you cry.

He raises pups and trains them to race and deliver. Then comes Togo, Togo barely survives in beginning, he's the runt of the litter. He is called weak and small but you can never underestimate the heart of a survivor and champion. Togo causes problems for his owner in the beginning and tries to get rid of togo. His owner doesn't believe in him but Togo continues to show his worth and finally he is made lead sled dog and in doing so, creates a ripple effect throughout history. Togo is a true hero and this story tells you why Balto received the credit instead of Togo. A new line of dogs is bred from Togo. Such a moving and touching story of man's best friend and how important they can be in your life and others. If you love animals or dogs in general, you will love this movie. 10/10 for humanity",

            "content": "I admit it, I'm a sentimentalist. I cried like a baby at my own wedding while my wife looked on in bemusement. I weep at favourite songs or pieces of music and shed tears freely at emotionally charged movies. It was my wife's brother who recommended we watch this movie during lockdown and I really should have read the signs. First off it's a Disney movie, secondly it's about a brave dog ...and right from these two facts, I knew I was going to struggle to get through it dry-eyed.And so it proved. With films like this, for me anyway, critical faculties are suspended and you just get caught up in the action and want it all to end happily, especially for the dogs. I do know that Willem Dafoe and Julianne Nicholson were excellent in their parts as the slightly mismatched couple who set up home in the remote, frozen, northernmost part of America. He's the local \"mush-man\" responsible for trekking his team of husky dogs over unforgiving terrain for the benefit of the local community while she provides all the back-up back home he needs for them both to keep their operation going.Comes a catastrophic diphtheria outbreak to the town, especially targeting young children and the need to requisition urgent medical supplies from some 500 miles or so away, but with an impending spell of bad weather knocking out the possible use of aeroplane or rail transport, the only way to go get the job done is for Dafoe and his dogs to undertake a hazardous cross-country trek like no other to collect the vaccines and get them back to the hospital to help save the kids' lives.This was a thrilling and moving race against time, taking on the elements and indeed the odds, the effort spearheaded by crusty old Dafoe and his pack, especially Togo the pack-leading dog. Early on we're fed the back story of how Togo came into the couple's possession and how the dog's irrepressible desire to accompany Dafoe on his travels sees him twice unsuccessfully try to offload the dog to new owners, only for Togo to somehow find a way to break free and return back home from whence he came. Finally Dafoe is persuaded by the dog's errr... doggedness, to reluctantly road-test the apparently under-sized dog and eventually concede that its courage and stamina outweigh any physical disadvantages it may have.We see the pack endure unbelievable dangers in their epic mission, Togo literally pulling out all the stops to navigate the team over breaking ice-floes, slog up snow-bound foot-hills and even save the group from certain doom near the end, in a particularly amazing show of love, strength and fortitude by the dog.It's a Disney film so there's probably a fair bit of dramatic licence taken with the story but you'll have a good idea how it ends. The landscapes, making great use of drone shots on-high are frequently eye-catching and there's was a plaintive lonesome-violin soundtrack which further set the scene. I don't know how much of the cinematography was C-Gen assisted but the actions of the dogs and Togo in particular, looked natural to me.Anyway I got through to the end dry-eyed and dog-tired, to quote Elvis Costello, and immediately afterwards felt the need to hug our own dog of over ten years in sympathy and appreciation for what I'd just seen.",

So my hopes for this movie were definitely not high. Then the movie began and I was immediately intrigued. The movie follows the journey of an older man named Leonhard Seppala, and his trusty 12 year old Husky Togo. Seppala leads his sled dog team, with Togo leading, across Alaska. The movie has noteworthy action scenes and a truly heartwarming backstory/plot. If you want to watch a fairly new movie that pulls at your heartstring, and feels you with a zest for life. Then Togo is the movie for you. It hits all the key points that a superb movie needs: charming characters, an extraordinary backstory, and adventure! In this 1 hour and 54 minute movie you become attached and almost connected with the characters. Overall I thought the movie Togo was a breathtaking film. That was able to accurately depict the true story of Togo and Leinhard Seppala.",

As someone of Norwegian descent who grew up in Alaska, I found nothing jarring as is far too often the case when someone tries to depict Alaska.And the dogs were amazing. Particularly Togo, who is supposed to be played by one of his actual descendants. Add in the cute puppy and any animal lover, young or old, will be enthralled.Not wanting it to end, both my husband and I went to the internet to find our more about this heroic dog. The true story of Togo is reportedly even more amazing, but I thought Disney did a great job of turning this into an exciting, edge of your seat type of movie.Haven't enjoyed a movie this much in a very long time.",

When it comes to dog centric films, I tend to not watch them because let\u2019s just be honest - most of them are sad. Beautiful, but sad. Togo may look like just another Disney dog movie, but it is so much more. This film blew me away from start to finish. And one really interesting fact about this film is it IS based on a true story. I even fact checked the movie after and was floored to find how truly faithful this movie is to the real events.If you grew up with the animated film Balto, I can\u2019t recommend the watch more, it takes the story of a dog mushing adventure that we loved as kids but made for the whole family - and especially us adults.  Willem Dafoe again proves his worth as an actor, giving a beautiful performance and Julianne Nicholson was a brilliant cast to back his character up. Give it a watch - you don\u2019t be disappointed.",
