            "content": "This is the kind of stuff that makes your blood boil, doesn't it? Whenever I become aware of instances where products produced by large corporations are deemed dangerous or hazardous to one's health, I always wonder whether the executives of those companies have any trouble sleeping at night. In the case of Teflon or it's component PFOA, the summary of the story concludes that it can now be found in ninety nine percent of everything living on the planet. Seeing as how this includes those same executives themselves and their families, you have to wonder why they would willingly keep on poisoning themselves. It took real courage and a whole lot of persistence for the real live Rob Bilott, here portrayed by Mark Ruffalo, to take on the huge Dupont Chemical Company back in the late Nineties when he first learned how one of their dump sites was poisoning the ground water and streams in his former home town of Parkersburg, West Virginia. It didn't take long for Bilott and his law firm to realize the system was rigged to cover up wrong doing and avoid accountability for their poor corporate behavior. The film I'm sure can't possibly convey the frustration and anger experienced by his law firm and it's clients over the decade plus long battle to set things right, just as I'm sure no amount of damages can soothe the families who lost loved ones to the hazards posed by a poisonous product. It might sound like a lot to hear that Dupont eventually settled for a six hundred seventy million dollar fine over it's use of Teflon, but if you break it down, it's just under a hundred ninety thousand dollars per case. Seems to me like the company got away cheap.",

This one's quite similar to the John Travolta flick A CIVIL ACTION or even ERIN BROKOVICH, but even better, following a lengthy and complex case through to its conclusion. It's a dark and sombre production with a depressing subject matter, yet it's also very well acted and quietly gripping from beginning to end.",

It's about self-regulation, big-business, medical disasters and cover-ups on a scale that just doesn't seem possible in today's world.I had no idea this movie was about one of the most well-known brands in the world (that DuPont owns) ... and the terrible secret behind it. Since the name is not advertised in the previews, I won't spoil it here ... but everyone has heard of it and ... ugh ... been somewhat contaminated by it.This is not really an \"action\" movie ... it's a bit of a slow-burn as developments take place over stretches of time. Mark Ruffalo's performance is fine ... though it's fair to say there are other actors who could have put in more compelling and watchable performances.I'd have to admit that if the movie wasn't about real events, it would be so-so. However, because it is based on actual events ... you can't help but want to know how the movie unfolds.While there are some unexplained issues relating to the main character's law firm and boss (who inexplicably seem to side with an underdog case) ... it's not enough to derail the story ... because the main plot really did transpire.It's a good movie to remind us that we're not as protected by our systems, institutions and government as we'd like to think.",

Go ahead and call it \"Aaron Brockovich.\" But director Todd Haynes still makes it entirely engaging and painfully true that death is a number compared to liability and that is how you can sustain cold hearted industry. Made more gut wrenching is how they believed the ends justified the means.\nMark Ruffalo tackles the lawyer with the conscience wonderfully. Suffering under the weight of what he must do and what then envelops his small world. It's heroic in how much he does sacrifice and let's face it, these stories don't end well. What director Haynes does is put a face to the not-on-the-books crime. And though, it only is a civil case somehow you sense the frustration of the town. Not played as rubes but believing that a massive corporation who funded and gave perks to sustain the village wouldn't willingly destroy it. As we know now versus 1998, they knew...if not for simple morbid curiosity. Then sat on the information as it fed the machine decades later, we are now more informed and much more paranoid. Everything we eat or touch or...breathe we are closer to death.\nI was in that area in 1998...and the news then spent less time on it then I recall. As a college bound student, I heard murmurs of DuPont and jokes were made of this. Now...it seems bitterly grim. How many lives were destroyed because of shady dealings. When you peel the onion, you do weep.\nI love this flick. The flavor of that era is pitch perfect. The backroads of an industrial town, built under poor chemistry just sweats disease. And you walk out angered by it. The fight continues to this day.",

Directing was good but the editing was terrible in some parts. I also felt the 126 min runtime was too long, and felt even longer with the slow pacing and some dragged out/unnecessary scenes. Had the pacing been faster and 20-25 mins shaved off the runtime, I would've rated this gem higher. Still, a great biopic about a story that needed to be told, and a well deserved 8/10 from me.

            "content": "\"Dark Waters\" (2019 release; 126 min.) brings the story of Cincinnati lawyer Rob Bilott's long legal battle against DuPont. As the movie opens, it is \"1975 Parkersburg, West Virginia\" as we see several teenagers (one of them a young Bilott) go swimming in a lake that we later see being sprayed with chemicals. We then go to \"1998 Cincinnati, Ohio\", and Rob has just made partner at Taft, one of the large law firms in Cincinnati. Then a stranger shows up who is from Parkersburg and knows Rob's grandmother. The stranger, Wilbur Tennant, claims that chemicals have ruined his farm, he has the VHS tapes to prove it, and can Rob please represent him.... At this point we're 10 min. into the movie, but to tell you more of the plot would spoil your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all turns out.Couple of comments: this is the latest movie from Todd Haynes, whose prior movie, the excellent \"Carol\" was coincidentally also filmed here in Cincinnati (where I live). But that is where the comparisons stop. Here, Haynes brings to the big screen the long legal battle that Bilott fought against chemical giant DuPont. The film starts a bit tentative in my opinion, but after the first half hour, the tension doesn't let up as DuPont is fighting with all of its might against Bilott. This movie is a labor of love for Mark Ruffalo, who stars and also co-produces. I've seen a lot of the films that Ruffalo has made in his career, and I don't know that he's ever been better, playing the almost mousy yet determined lawyer. Anne Hathaway seems underused as the supportive spouse but as the movie goes deeper, her role expands. The movie was filmed in early 2019 in and around Cincinnati, and the downtown area is featured extensively, including Fountain Square, the Queen City Club, the Hall of Mirrors at the Netherland Plaza, etc.The movie had a red carpet premiere here in Cincinnati in mid-November, a week before it got a limited theater release. This weekend it got a wide release, and the Friday early evening screening where I saw it at my art-house theater here in Cincinnati was attended okay (about 20 people). This movie will surely create strong word of mouth, and if it manages to pick up some award nominations (as it is expected), this could have a decent run in the theaters. If you are interested in a tense legal drama where Mark Ruffalo shines, I'd readily suggest you check this out, be it in the theater, on VOD, or eventually on DVD/Blu-ray.",

I am not on board with the idea that because a company is big it is evil. This is about one that has been.

            "review_title": "Corporate Malfeasance That Borders On Corporate Homicide",
            "content": "In recent decades, particularly since the horror that erupted on 9/11, more than a few dramatic movies have dealt with real-life events and/or social issues in ways that are often so engaging that they supersede most Hollywood blockbusters. Some of the very best deal with the kind of rampant corporate malfeasance that goes on when there are few or no regulations in place to protect the people that these corporations have a tendency to harm with all-too-painful regularity. DARK WATERS is one of those films.Mark Ruffalo portrays Robert Billott, a Cincinnati-based attorney who is part of a law firm that represents dozens of multi-billion dollar corporations, the biggest not only in America but the world at large as well. But when he hears about a farmer in his own hometown of Parkersburg, West Virginia who has lost nearly two hundred head of cows because they drank from toxically polluted water, he wades into the situation (albeit reluctantly at first) and discovers that one of the companies he has represented in his time, no less than DuPont, is the corporation whose dumping of their toxic waste is responsible for not having only killed livestock, but poisoning and/or severely deforming almost everybody there in Parkersburg, nearly seventy thousand in all. Combing through documents dating all the way back to the 1970s, he learns that some of this poisoning may be connected to a very well-known product, that DuPont created back in the early 1960s (everyone will know all too well what the name of that product is), and is in practically everything in every home in the United States, including pots and pans. The toll it took on him and his family, including the relationship with his wife (portrayed by Anne Hathaway) was almost too much for him (he ended up in the hospital for a time); but he kept on fighting for the people in his town, getting blood samples from everyone tested to be used as evidence of DuPont's corporate malfeasance, which virtually bordered on corporate homicide.Based on Nathaniel Rich's article \"The Lawyer Who Became DuPont's Worst Nightmare\" that appeared in the New York Times Magazine in 2016, DARK WATERS is quite well directed by Todd Haynes (I'M NOT THERE; WONDERSTRUCK), and co-written by Matthew Michael Carnahan (LIONS FOR LAMBS; DEEPWATER HORIZON). Ruffalo, who portrayed one of the Boston Globe reporters in the much-acclaimed 2015 drama SPOTLIGHT, ably portrays Billott in a way that gives us a glimpse into his way of thinking that, just by having represented DuPont in his time, he himself may have been somewhat responsible for the years-long poisoning of his own hometown, even if only indirectly. The atmosphere conjured up by Haynes is not too dissimilar to what we saw in ALL THE PRESIDENT'S MEN, SPOTLIGHT, or THE POST, one that is decidedly sinister, shadowy and arguably corrupting. Tim Robbins, well known for his highly liberal political beliefs, does a good job of playing Ruffalo's partner in the firm, who is initially extremely reluctant to take his side but then does when the facts about DuPont become too big to ignore. Mare Winningham is also good as one of Parkersburg's many residents who have to face what the town's biggest employer has been doing to then for decades.While it may seem all too common for movies to take what may seem like potshots at multi-billion dollar conglomerates, when they do the wrong thing (which seems to happen all too frequently, as it did with DuPont), then those wrongs have to have a light shone on them. This is what DARK WATERS does; and as a result, it was one of the best films released in 2019.",

Covering a time period from the late 80's to mid to late 2000's the film is timely and a long journey to show the affects of common people's lives. It involves Robert Bilott(in a fine turn from Mark Ruffalo) a Cincinnati, Ohio corporate defense attorney who after being contacted by a family member of his old hometown of Parkersburg, West Virginia to go check on strange problems that a local farmer is having it's like all of his cows are dying! Upon investigation and viewing of dead cattle parts and looking at the local water it's clear that pollution is the norm.One by one the locals become affected with various and deadly health problems like cancer and the drama that starts to unfold is tense as Robert chooses morality over loyalty and decides to defend the people in a lawsuit against the giant chemical company named \"DuPont\" as thru later research and reports and some sharp investigative work it's clear the chemical giant has a big history of pollution. Wow what about a big cover up as these crimes have crippled many ever day people. Most shocking was the discovery of the traces of the toxic chemical Teflon which started in many day to day household products only to now be present in most everyone's body.Along the way the drama and stress that unfolds takes a toll on Robert only his supporting love and need to live is found in family as his trophy wife Sarah Bilott(the sexy Anne Hathaway) is the strong and leading captain of the family ship. This movie was well done as it showed how dirty and corrupt that society can be as corporate greed and harmful corruption must be discovered and fought.

When Wilbur shows him his field full of buried cows, \"190 of them,\" he realizes there is a problem.Although Bilott's firm doesn't have Dupont as a corporate client, they are reluctant to take on a nonpaying client that is going to end up suing Dupont as it will hurt their reputation with their own corporate clients.However, Tom Terp (Tim Robbins), Bilott's boss, supports Robert continuing his investigation even though his client cannot pay. There is a great scene when all the partners convene to hear and discuss Bilott's work.Finally, Dupont sends over all the discovery information that Bilott had requested, and it is massive. Hundreds of boxes of memos, reports, and other documentation. Being a team of one, dutifully Robert sits down on the floor and begins categorizing each document by year and subject. This is a great scene because it cements Robert's commitment to do the right thing no matter what it takes.His years of research comes up with proof that Dupont knew that they were poisoning people and animals through the creation, use of, and byproducts from POFA (C8), a chemical creation used in Teflon\u00a9 the non-stick coating that everyone was using. C8 is one of those chemicals that cannot be broken down by nature, let alone the human body and therefore it stays in the body and slowly causes various types of cancer.The film takes us through this story as it develops over the years of difficult lonely hard work on Bilott's part. The filmmakers did a great job of showing the passage of time by giving the audience quick glimpse of his three boys growing up in front of him. He barely interacts with them because he's so clearly focused on this one case, this man is all in.In the meantime, because of the court's slow processes, Dupont's putting roadblocks at every turn, and the slowness of a medical testing company that was reviewing, over sixty thousand blood tests, people were continuing to be poisoned and die from being exposed to C8.We watch as the stress of doing the right thing for his client requires him to take reductions in pay because he's spending all his time on this case that has no paying client. We watch him feel the pain while watching his clients deteriorate because of the poison.His wife Sarah (Anne Hathaway) tries to keep their family together, showing undying support, even as she sees the deterioration of her husband because of the deeply committed compassion to see this lawsuit through for the people who are being harmed.One thing the film made sure of was the darkness of this subject. Every scene is dark in color or filled with gray skies.Ruffalo was excellent as the committed attorney who gave up almost everything, including his life, to find and fight for the truth. Hathaway was superb as his supportive wife attempting to keep their family together while Robert fights for the truth. Robbins was influential as Bilott's boss and senior managing partner of their law firm, showing support for Robert on this long trail to truth. Camp was terrific, and the driven farmer and rancher who committed his life to making sure Dupont was charged for their crimes against his community. Victor Garber, as Phil Donnelly, a senior executive in Dupont, was supreme in his portrayal of being the mouthpiece of corporate malfeasance. Mare Winningham, as Darlene Kiger, a Parkersburg resident, was fantastic. It was lovely to see her on the screen again. Mario Correa and Matthew Michael Carnahan wrote a powerfully detailed script. Todd Haynes did a great job of creating the feel corporate malfeasance and the difficulty of making wealthy companies pay for their crimes against humanity.Overall: This is an excellent story about the power of perseverance.",

It does at times jump a little much ahead into the future hitting bullet points of history. At the same time, I'm not sure how else to economically tell this story in a little over two hours. The centerpiece of this, where Ruffalo's Robert tells one person (his wife) and then another (his law boss Robbins), the man who didn't believe him at the corporation, and then the ornery farmer who we saw earlier shoot a cow in the head in self defense(!), is a masters class in how to handle exposition and to do cross-cutting to create a sequence.And Todd Haynes, who hasn't helmed a film like this before (and normally I wouldn't think he'd go for it, and kudos to him for collaborating with Ruffalo), ultimately he does manage to smuggle in this greater idea that goes for these bottom-less-pocket-book-deep wells of money like Dupont, but it's also about power itself. The people in West Virginia poisoned and made to die can be a metaphor for any kind of institution (i.e. political) that hides and cajoles and yet those being hurt will support them... until it may be too late. If it has anything over Civil Action, it's the authenticity that comes with filming in the place (with several of the people from the case), and Haynes's unique eye (look at how he stages that medical scene late in the film).",

Count Dark Waters as being placed in that elite genre which describes a lone (ironically) corporate lawyer who takes on chemical giant DuPont.\nIn this semi-documentary dramatic work, the case against DuPont in poisoning the water, land and air in and near its facilities--and extensively throughout the world--is overwhelmingly strong. One thread going through my mind while watching Dark Waters is how DuPont will react to this onslaught of evidence against them (Apparently, according one PBS article, the company has a lot of \"legal folks\" looking into this movie, but it doesn't want to drive more attention to the story.).\nIt's tough to make a several-year span lawyerly-driven movie ultra-exciting, but the M.M. Carnahan script provides enough visual stimuli (like the massive document discovery provided by DuPont that fills a large room) to move the story forward. Mark Ruffalo's steady demeanor is countered by Anne Hathaway's occasionally over the top histrionics that show the emotional toll one man was undergoing in his battle against DuPont.\nWell worth your while to know how much PFOA's (via Teflon, etc) we all are carrying inside of us because of DuPont's lack of honesty.",

Heck, it's one of the best and most monomania films of this year.\"Waters\", while harboring a look of grubbiness and a subject matter that's equally as grubby, is a terrific true story drama, a naturalistic sort of documentary, and an effective, low key paranoia thriller to boot.In verity, if you like the dreary temperament of North Country, the investigative candor of Erin Brockovich, the exhaustion of A Civil Action, or 2015's Spotlight, then Dark Waters will effectively put you in cinematic harm's way. It's about a corporate defense attorney who brings forth a lawsuit involving the famed chemical company named DuPont. DuPont is a large corporation that makes Teflon and Teflon might be responsible for many unexplained deaths.Dialogue driven, perfectly acted, and maturely directed by LA native Todd Haynes, \"Waters\" runs 128 minutes and spans almost two decades.The towns of Cincinnati, OH and Parkersburg, WV are featured in \"Waters\" as they appear like dreary landscapes waiting for the hellhole slaughter. Cows and people are dying, snow and fall skies are evident, and teeth of animals/humans are staining. Yup, Dark Waters is not meant for your entertainment or your feel-good constitution. It's meant to seep into your movie-goer's central nervous system while staying there.As you view Dark Waters, you might adopt a fear of contaminated water. And I'm not talking about the kind of water where a certain great white shark is lingering or a trip to Mexico is calling. You'll also revel in the mesmerizing performances by Mark Ruffalo (he disappears into character via defense attorney Robert Bilott), Anne Hathaway (Bilott's intense wife), and Tim Robbins (Bilott's equally intense superior).All in all, Dark Waters will garner multiple conspiracies and multiple Academy Award nominations this coming January (that's my prediction). \"Hands (and hooves) across these waters\".

I absolutely hate big corporations, those companies that make billions of dollars whilst playing with our health. Those corporations think they are above the law, they probably make the laws themselves, that's how sick our society is. Capitalism is the cancer of humanity. Those people should be hanged on the town square, as should be their families just to set an example. Instead they get away with it like they always do. Bribes, media manipulation, lies and deception, it's all on their agenda. Those people make me sick, even more than their chemicals. Companies like Monsanto, Dupont and plenty of others all belong in prison or in a coffin, but corrupt governments will keep them safe. It's time people start revolting and make them pay, not with money but with their lifes. Dark Waters is the perfect example of how a company gets away with murder for years and even when they're proven guilty they continue their dirty games. Teflon is still available in stores so to me nothing changed at all, thanks to the whole failing and corrupted system. Mark Ruffalo did a good job playing Rob Bilott. i never heard of Rob Bilott before but i have an immense respect for people that fight those cases that are basically unwinable.

Tonally, these two are polar opposites, but they both illustrate their convoluted and complicated stories of corporate corruption well. Well enough for any non-chemist, non-lawyer, non-doctor to understand the injustice that corporate overlords have exacted upon the public.The film is constantly tearing down the spirit of Mark Ruffalo, followed by brief, hopeful moments that Dupont will be held accountable for poisoning tens of thousands of people. These hopeful and demoralizing notes begin small. The idea that the EPA will help Wilbur Tenant, the farmer who had his cattle herd die from poisoned drinking water, is followed by Ruffalo realizing that report was written in part by Dupont scientists who will, of course, be corrupt. And that demoralizing note is followed by bestowing the hope that Wilbur Tenant will finally get his long sought chance for a $ settlement, and that's followed by the soul crushing scene of his entire family drinking water out of the tap, still poisoning themselves with no other means to change their fate.That was the scene that made me cry with rage. That nothing could be done to escape their death. What could they do without water? They're thirsty, and stressed, and their kids just want to come home from school and live normal lives. All I could do was cry tears of rage. Wilbur was not being served justice.The notes continue swooping from high to low. Ruffalo is served mountains of paperwork during the lawsuit against Dupont. Like, a laughable amount that no one could ever finish reviewing. But he sets to work anyway and finds the smoking gun: Dupont has known about the poison for decades. The film makes the audience believe we have Dupont dead to rights, but they wiggle out of it with legal maneuvering. When it has been years after the public blood testing, and no answers are given as to whether Dupont is at fault, the public gets angry at Ruffalo. All this pressure builds into him having a mental breakdown/siezure, and we all feared he would quit. Then, after he recovers, the call finally comes from the science panel that he was right. Dupont absolutely poisoned these people and must pay for their health damage. This movie is like an emotionally abusive boyfriend.Finally, we won, right? No. Dupont rips up the mediation contract (one would think this illegal) and now says anyone who has health problems cannot take part in a class action lawsuit, but can do so individually.And that's when we finally leave on the highest of high notes that makes you curse with joy and unleash primal, guttural screams of victory: Mark Ruffalo starts representing each of those West Virginians individually, wins tens of millions of dollars in the first 3 cases, and DUPONT GIVES UP. THEY PAYOUT THE BETTER PART OF A BILLION DOLLARS. WHOOOOOOOOOOOOO YEAAAH SUCK IT.",

The plot plays out in a fairly factual and engaging manner, and it is hard not to take something away from it in terms of its underlying commentary on corporate actions and the role that 'profit at all cost' has in the running of business. With plenty of talent in the cast, the story is well delivered but it is the overall construct of the piece that lets it down a bit.On one hand, it is good that the film doesn't artificially have 'big' moments and courtroom confessions, because this is not true to the methodical nature of the real case; however it does feel like it is on the other end of the spectrum, where it is almost too earnest and serious in telling its story. I see what it is aiming for, and I don't think trying to make it zippy or snappy would have worked, but unfortunately it does come off as a bit stodgy and bogged down by itself. It isn't one thing that does this, the colour palette, the period detail, the score, and other aspects all contribute to the overall.Worth a look for the worthiness of its story, but I do wish it didn't wear it quite as heavily as it does across the board.",

Top examples include All The President's Men (1976), The Insider (1999), Erin Brockovich (2000), Fair Game (2010), Concussion (2015), Spotlight (2015), On the Basis of Sex (2018) -- the list goes on an on, and you probably have your own favorites. Dark Waters fully earns its place on this list for quality and impact, not least because of Mark Ruffalo's performance.One thing I like a lot about this film is precisely that it's not flamboyant. It's slow-burn but easy to watch even though the subject material (uncovering a legacy of synthetic \"forever chemicals\" in our environment) is not a happy one in any way. The pacing is steady and deliberate, and it's the kind of role that I think Ruffalo is well suited to. Not that he isn't pretty versatile (compare what he did in Spotlight as a gonzo journalist) but this just seems to be more centered for him, playing real-life lawyer Rob Bilott as a low-key but dogged guy who just can't give up on his pursuit of the trail. An Oscar nom is sure to come next year.All the other roles are secondary. Anne Hathaway is stuck with playing the Loyal Wife with only a few excursions into a bit of character development. And Victor Garber is stuck with being the evil DuPont CEO. But I thought in a way that the most interesting role of all was played by Tim Robbins, as the head of Bilott's law firm. He starts out grudgingly allowing Rob's crusade, but instead of staying in this stereotypical high-priced-lawyer persona he gradually turns into a staunch supporter for (wow!) reasons of right and truth.Too bad this one isn't doing well at the box office --- everyone should see it. I give it 9/10.Footnote: About chemicals. The subject of the movie is \"forever chemicals\" (in this case, C8) that are synthetic and never break down in the environment or the human body. But it would be easy to come out of the movie thinking that \"chemicals are bad\". Everything around us in this complex world is chemical and you have to ask what each one does. There's one small moment in the movie where a chemist consultant is talking to Rob about fluorides. He says (correctly!) that SMALL doses in the public water supply are good (and in fact a lot better than nothing at all) because they harden teeth and reduce decay. But BIG doses are bad. It's all a matter of finding what the right level is. The old saying is that \"the dose makes the poison\" -- not the chemical itself.",

I was mostly intrigued to see what Todd Haynes would do with the formula, since he's explored such a unique creative touch in films I've adored (\"Safe\", \"Far from Heaven\") and films I've felt more lukewarmly about (\"Carol,\" \"I'm Not There\"). Surprisingly, he charges straight down the line with \"Dark Waters.\" This is an interesting if not engrossing film, and it feels like it could be directed by anybody.That's not necessarily a bad thing when you have an actor as good as Mark Ruffalo in the lead, because the movie gets out of his way and lets him do his thing. He gives a restrained, compelling performance and resists the urge to overplay the everyman-as-hero aspects of this story. This film is more \"Silkwood\" than \"Erin Brockovich.\" As much fun as it was to watch Julia Roberts tearing around the screen giving everyone a what-for, she wasn't once believable as a working class broad. Ruffalo, on the other hand, IS believable as a modest attorney in Rust Belt America, and he builds a full performance out of subtle, quiet moments rather than any big, showy, Oscar clip ones. This is basically a one-man show, though he's given able support by Tim Robbins, who's worth the price of admission for the scene where he hands a young cocky attorney his ass, and Bill Pullman, gruff and hilarious and using an accent from God knows where. The weak link in the cast is Anne Hathaway as Ruffalo's wife, who, for all of her sweetness and goody-goodiness as an actress, is miscast as a wholesome, Christian mom.I can't think too much about \"Dark Waters\" because it will keep me up nights and will give me a phobia about ever drinking or eating anything ever again.Grade: A-",

And while the cold, sunless atmosphere reflects the grim situation, we are more worried by the realisation that it's already too late than how the events play out in the film.The film also briefly touches on the rampant corruption within the government that allows these big & powerful conglomerates to get away with everything at the expense of public safety, all for a piece of their cake. Performances are good from the entire cast but the characters they play aren't interesting at all and fail to make us care about them.Overall, Dark Waters is a well-crafted & finely narrated legal thriller that takes its inspirations from a real-life malpractice yet fails to deliver the desired impact due to Haynes' one-note execution.

            "content": "The countdown to today means it has to end eventually, unless they go futuristic on us. But Ruffalo's hand, I couldn't not think of Hulk, and naturally where it leads is not going to be a transformation but the breakdown; so the direct parallel makes this a film about 'heroism'. \"Better not to feel like a failure.\" Opposite! Greater than success: a hero. These chemical agents in the water impact the receptor and create mutations. Hulk. We even see the outcomes. It's a giant synchronicity, or it's intentional, or accidental--I say this about every artist is they bring their entire body of work with them and constantly it's the case. Also the same biopic movie wife as always, she overplays something better in small doses, but the small dose creates an impact. Her stare is the world's. So impress her with some great heroism. And movie wives are best when they're in on it--even wicked--as when she whispers ideas to him in bed. I laughed at his reaction to her big oscar-meltdown, because it's sort of a lazy husband, same time his message is constantly clear: this is the road, complaining is futile because it's the road. Often we get a frame and if it's proper you create a fully functional mechanism that informs itself, like a great work of engineering. The pile of boxes in the room come early, hopeless to organize, and he does. It builds into his heroism, mastering this impossible knowledge, leading to this weary actualization. He is 'so' ahead of the villains that everything they throw at him he can conceptualize as the response, even down to surprising him by not playing fair, which only delays things. That the system cant keep up with his mastery integration builds this cat and mouse leading to another act to best them, the blood sampling. Villainous obfuscation vs an even greater act of integration, means moving from past to 'now'. It's also why it takes so long, ages him, and tears him down. It's a superhero vs a supervillain. Lastly, Haynes can do the auteur's satiric reality, but what I admire about him is he can clearly do without it. Even his auteur works strive to earn it and avoid the 'brand', and that's cinema is you humble to the craft rather than the other way. It's an easy trap, but it also means we must look for the motivator, the frame. And I think maybe he was offered the superhero films and chose this instead, and there is what it is. Because the car almost exploding, we got that last week, we get that every week, it's more the way it blurs the line that he asks there, wait am I in a movie?",

Based on a true event as portrayed by Nathaniel Rich in a New York Times magazine article and adapted for the screen by Mario Correa and Matthew Michael Carnahan, this power play as unwound by a humble lawyer is obviously an important statement that captured the interest and commitment of Producer/Actor Mark Ruffalo. The result is an impressive film that is a wake-up call for many issues. Todd Haynes directs with sensitivity and authority.Very briefly, Rob Bilott (Mark Ruffalo) is a new lawyer who signs on with major law firm headed by Tom Terp (Tim Robbins) and almost immediately is called into the service of a farmer (Bill Camp) in West Virginia (because of a relationship with his grandmother) and slowly discovers the terror of Teflon (the source of the C-8 chemical that threatens health) which has been secretly dumped by the maker DuPont at their factory site in West Virginia. The discovery process is slow, but as Bilott pursues the truth he is nearly submerged by the power of a big corporation able to deny and then elude the consequences of the tragedy. In the end it is the fortitude and passion of Bilott (aided by his firm and his wife (Anne Hathaway) that ultimately brings justice for the health-affected people of West Virginia over the course of twenty years from beginning to end!The cast is large and consistently excellent, including some of the actual people of the town of Parkersburg, WV. Mark Ruffalo delivers a staggeringly fine performance, and the additional elements at film's end underline his commitment to the story and the importance of telling that story. This is both a fine film and an important social document, one that should be seen by everyone. Grady Harp, November 20",

Mark Ruffalo is on the Robert Redford filmaking/acting line of activism and protest since they share credits on The Last Castle (2001). This is probably his finest work up today, and is not a Superheroe piece of garbage with special effects and tons of CGI instead a great script. This is a very difficult film to watching, because denounces how great global corporations woprk without any respecto and concern for all kind of life. It is not an exageration to say that what Dupont make to American people and to the world is not very far from what Adolf Hitler and Nationalsocialism made to Germany after 1933. But this is far worst because affected all the planet and all forms of life. If you don't get very very angry and sick after seen this movie, you really don't belong to human race, and you deserve thta other global companies take your future and throw away to the garbage can.This is an exceptional film, based on pure acting, and a simple storytell about greed and disrepect to any form of life, of that what Karl Marx call The superior form of capitalism.

But Tim changes his mind after Mark starts showing him evidence of exactly what DuPont is knowingly doing. Anne is Mark's wife and Victor is the head of DuPont. It is an eye opening tale which helps explain lots of things going on in the world today, such as increasing cancer cases, deformed births, and lots of other medical problems.

Mark Ruffalo, returning to this investigative sub-genre after 2015's Spotlight, gives another terrific performance, and he's supported by several other noteworthy actors doing great work. I think in many ways this film could have been more satisfying if it was made in a few years as the case(s) against Dupont is quite frankly, still going on.

There are many discoveries made in the film that frankly angered me. It's insane to see what the chemical corporation DuPont did and what they put at stake just for money. I love seeing a film where a person obsesses over a certain case or mystery and Dark Waters is exactly that. We follow Bilott through this case that spans many years and get an insight into his work as well as his personal life. It's incredible to witness how much time and work he put into this case, the toll it has on his life as he gets consumed by it and Mark Ruffalo's performance conveys it brilliantly as usual. Tim Robbins is also part of the film for a short time and he does a great job. Bill Camp is also terrific in his role. Anne Hathaway is not in the film as much I thought but she does a great job even though I wish there was more to her character in the story.The film doesn't try to be overdramatic in its telling of the story or its presentation. Director Todd Haynes keeps this story grounded and engaging through its runtime. The dark look to the film works really well with the story and adds a level of intensity to the film. The film also runs for 2 hours but I did feel the film starting to drag towards the end.It's sad to see a great film like Dark Waters be swept under the rug due to the bad marketing. The poster and trailer do not convey what the film is about well which is disappointing considering how important of a film this is.

So I now find myself accompanying her to the cinema to see Dark Waters, a film that she's already seen by...ahem...'other means', but which she now wishes to see on the big screen to get the full Robbins effect.I can take or leave Mr. Robbins, and films about corporate law really aren't my thing, so I wasn't expecting too much, but I'm happy to say that Dark Waters is actually pretty good -- not nearly as funny as the people in front of us thought (they were old and probably didn't know where they were), but still quite absorbing, the film helped in no small part by a strong central performance from Mark Ruffalo (he's the real star of the movie; Robbins only has a supporting role as his boss). Ruffalo plays corporate lawyer Rob Bilott, who represents a West Virginian farmer who claims that U.S. chemical giant DuPont are responsible for poisoning his land and livestock. As Bilott investigates, he discovers the one thing that any sane person already knows: that big corporations couldn't give a flying rat's arse about the consumer and their well-being just so long as the dollars keep rolling in.What follows is a David vs. Goliath battle that sees Bilott risking all to get DuPont to accept responsibility for polluting the environment with 'forever' chemical perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA), also known as C8, which can cause all manner of potentially fatal conditions. The film features a lot of paper-shuffling, people suffering from terminal disease, and a bad CGI cow, which might not be some people's idea of a good night out, but I say give it a whirl -- it's a damn sight better than a lot of the twaddle I've seen recently (Cats, Bombshell and Birds of Prey, take a bow).7.5/10, which I would have rounded up to 8 if it wasn't for a couple of 'jokey' moments where Bilott's kids say inappropriate things (yes, the old folk in front of me found them hilarious); to me, these moments of levity seemed totally out of place.N.B. Look out for a shot of the DuPont chemical works at the end of the film that sees the smoke being sucked back into a chimney (they must have reversed the footage and hoped that no-one would notice).",

A thrilling case that took years to build is given great detail to help explain everything happening, while also moving to keep you engaged. The acting and multiple aspects really do the film justice and give everyone the chance to act to their top game. It's true it still is subjected to overdramatization at times, but it's kept in check to keep things spicy and appeal to the drama seeking nature that is humanity. I'd have liked a few more elements added to give a better visualization of the corrupt companies, while also giving Anne Hathaway more time to shine, but overall I'm very happy with this. I feel this film will go under the radar, and to be honest, only the engaging story and acting will attract a theater watch for most.

Now, when I say non-actors, a select few of the characters being portrayed were played by the actual individuals. Likewise, the actual Robert and Sarah Bilott made cameos which are revealed at the end. Their presence made the issue hit home that much more, especially that of Bucky Bailey, but you'll have to see the movie to understand exactly why that is.I left this movie fully acknowledging that it's the scariest film I've ever seen. There were no demons or ghosts or jump scares, but there was a brutal honesty that I myself was unprepared to face.I do want to be blatantly honest about the captivating nature of this film. It is an informational film and it is deeply involving legal proceedings and the like. In other words, it's a slow-paced film that will likely be best appreciated by mature viewers.

Mark Ruffalo is Rob Bilott, a defense attorney for a company like DuPont who takes on the case that leaves him in a torn and conflicted state. As he digs deeper into the matter and fits the pieces of the puzzle the enormity of the situation overwhelms him altering his outlook and course for good. The resulting drama is an adept take on the David and Goliath struggle as the pendulum swings between power and righteousness. The lovely Anne Hathaway slips comfortably in second lead as the harried and devoted wife who struggles and endures the trials and tribulations that such a challenge brings. A fine realist piece on contemporary life and its universal relevance.",

However, a film should still be interesting and entertaining, as it is a film, and not 2 hours of \"corporations are bad\". And I personally think it did just that. It's really interesting and Mark Ruffalo's character is really likeable and you end up really relating. Speaking of Mark Ruffalo, he was absolutely brilliant in this. Really nailed the role. Tim Robbins was also excellent. Anna Hathaway was neither here or there unfortunately, but none the less it was great to see such good performances.Throughout the entire film, I was hooked about this case, I was wanting to know what happened next and it was just done really well. For a story that realistically doesn't sound like it would be interesting as a film, really delivers.The film does, in my opinion, go on a little longer than it needs to. It doesn't take anything away from the film, but you do feel yourself starting to stray away from concentration.Overall, it's a really interesting story and one I would personally recommend.",

            "content": "My wife and I watched this at home on BluRay from our public library.In a nutshell big chemical company Dupont in the 1960s invented the Teflon process for making non stick kitchen pans and many other applications. At their plant in Parkersburg, West Virginia, chemical waste, particularly a fluorinated C8 called PFOA, was contaminating the environment, including drinking water. People began to develop unusual afflictions, including cancers and birth defects but Dupont continued to claim the chemicals were safe.Mark Ruffalo, who also was a producer, stars as attorney Rob Bilott. Working for a Cincinnati firm, he was approached by a farmer to handle a lawsuit. In part of his discovery he found old documents showing Dupont knew the chemicals were likely to cause the problems that they did.This represents a sad chapter in how a chemical company can be blinded by high profits, estimated at one billion dollars yearly from Teflon. The eventual costs of several millions in compensatory damages is just a small drop in their financial bucket. It brings to mind the saying \"\"it's easier to gain forgiveness than get permission\". In this case it was less expensive to settle a few thousand cases than to have terminated the manufacture of Teflon. No matter how many times a company may say \"Safety is our number one priority\" that is always a lie. \"Profit\" is their number one priority, they are in business to make money.NB - I am not anti-chemical, I had a career in Oil and Chemicals, but not Dupont. I know of no instances where my company put profits ahead of health and environmental practices, but there are many chemical companies, small and large, not all of them operate by the same guidelines. Plus one rogue CEO or VP can cause really bad things to happen.This is a good movie for what it is.",

I cannot find fault with this film. This should be required watching. It's horrible what this company did. They should've been shut down. They basically poisoned the entire world and still are. It's just unfathomable and I think it was scary when they showed how far the company went to ensure loyalty. The employees and townsfolk were basically singing the praises of their killers/poisoners. They turned against the farmer and couldn't see what DuPont did even after they were given proof.Hopefully all the people who knowingly or actively participated in this massive decades long cover up had or have experienced the same health issues that they subjected their employees to.

As a lawyer he starts a case against the American chemical company DuPont, because he has found traces that this chemical company is dumping toxic chemicals in nature and water. As a result of these actions, a local farmer has lost many good harvests and livestock. Later Robert also learns that through these actions of the chemical company their chemical waste has ended up in the drinking water, causing many pregnant women to become infected and thus giving birth to malformed babies. Robert must now come up with enough evidence to win the lawsuit over the rich corrupt chemistry company.This film shows how corrupt the world actually is, where rich business owners prefer a good income even if it is at the expense of the healthy lives of certain people or even an entire community. This film also looks a bit like the Oscar-winning film Spotlight of 2015, in which journalists also investigated the wrong action of a corrupt society. Mark Ruffalo even played a role in this film, but in Dark Waters he has to do his own handy research as a lawyer into the corrupt actions of another society.Because of all the research that the main character does in an almost unbeatable battle, the film does have an interesting story, but sometimes with a somewhat lengthy pace. All of the moving research scenes can happen a bit repeatedly at a time. For a somewhat better film, they could have summarized these research scenes a bit better, because then the tempo would have been a bit better.In this film, Mark Ruffalo only takes his character along with the evidence of the victims exposed to toxic chemicals against the corrupt richer company leaders. Mark Ruffalo knows how to wear the film independently. After Mark Ruffalo, Anne Hathaway also does good acting as his wife, who sees how his research influences him and his life in the fight against an unfair opponent.",

Sounds good.\nSYNOPSIS:\nThis is the story based on a real person named \"Robert Bilott\" and inspired by an article titled \"The Lawyer Who Became DuPont's Worst Nightmare.\" Robert Bilott (Mark Ruffalo) is a lawyer who primarily defends chemical corporations until a farmer from his old town of West Virginia asks for help to prove that there are chemicals being dumped in the water that is the cause of large amount of cow deaths. Although unconvinced at first, through excessive research and digging, Robert begins to find horrifying evidence of something much worse than just a deadly chemical to cows, but humans and all creatures alike.DIRECTION:\nIf I'm being honest, I don't have much to say in this realm. The direction by Todd Haynes was as technically solid as any other good film. Yes, just \"good.\" The color palette was probably a little too dull even for the subject matter and really the film's strong points really lye in the writing and some strong performances. I feel almost any other director could've done the same job, if not better.WRITING:\nThe writing is definitely a step up from the directing. The writing isn't perfect as there are some scenes that almost seemed unnecessary and just had me thinking \"get to the story!\" Now, there is much to be said about how much time and effort it must've been to retrieve all of this information and translate it to script. Yes, it's been done before, ie: Spotlight, Zodiac, etc., but this is quite possibly one of the most important stories to be told today as this is something that is still affecting everyone... TODAY. It is based on the NYTIMES article \"The Lawyer Who Became DuPont's Worst Nightmare\" by Nathanial Rich, but obviously there was far more research than a 10ish page article.ACTING:\nThe acting is definitely where the juice is at. This is where you take your regular beef sandwich and baptize it (In case you're not american enough to know what this means, it means you dump in in the beef juice). Mark Ruffalo gives a similarly excellent performance as he did in Spotlight. WOAH WOAH, I didn't say it was AS good, I said it was SIMILAR. Cool it, Mary. It's expected, but he really makes the film what it is. Anne Hathaway is great, as usual, but her role as the wife wasn't integral to the story. I understand showing he has a life outside of work with kids and a wife and showing the kid's grow older and older gives substance to the prolonged journey Robert is taking, but these were the scenes I felt could've been cut or replaced. Tim Robbins is in this and some other people and some other people. All did well, just kind've interchangeable.CONCLUSION:\nMr. John \"The Sexy and Over-qualified or something Critic Guy\" Yanulis, you rated this film a 3.5/5, yet after reading your overly long review it seems like a high rating. What can I say? I like it Ruff and I'm a sucker for investigative films on important and interesting topics. Also, I prefer rating my films on a 1-10 bases, but I'm limited. So really for me this film is like a 6.6/10.",

I want you to see a movie about toxic waste and a deadly, manmade chemical that is, right now, inside your body, like a timebomb, and will possibly someday cause you or your loved ones to contract cancer or endocrine disorders!No, really, it's a good movie. \"Dark Waters\" had my attention throughout, and it wasn't depressing as one might think. That's because the center of the film is a real hero, Robert Bilott, a high-priced lawyer who sacrificed much of his personal and professional life, and his health, to researching the deadly chemical, DuPont's manipulation of the public, and to getting some financial compensation for victims.Bilott's own book is titled \"Exposure: Poisoned Water, Corporate Greed, and One Lawyer's Twenty-Year Battle against DuPont.\" That title offers a good plot summary.Mark Ruffalo stars as Robert Bilott. Wilbur Tennant (Bill Camp), a dairy farmer from Bilott's grandmother's West Virginia hometown, asks Bilott to discover why his cows are dying horrible deaths. Another lawyer might walk away, But Bilott, urged on by Tennant, does research and discovers that DuPont, as part of the manufacture of Teflon pans, produces a chemical that harms and kills humans, that never breaks down, and that is found, now, in the bodies of virtually all living things on earth, including humans.DuPont knew this but hid the information. Bilott's research uncovered DuPont's own extensive reports that detailed exactly how the chemical damaged human bodies. Bilott is shown meeting with DuPont employees who talk frankly about working on Teflon and giving birth to defective babies and needing to have hysterectomies.A few of the real people involved in this horror show appear in the film. These include William \"Bucky\" Bailey who was born with one nostril and a deformed eye. He had over thirty surgeries during his childhood. In a YouTube video, Bucky talks about his fears of fathering his own children. He was told he might pass his deformities on.I grew up near DuPont sites in New Jersey. Higher rates of cancer are reported there. Four members of my immediate family died from cancer and I've had cancer twice. Even so, I was compelled by and appreciated this movie. Watching the dedication of Robert Bilott and his tireless efforts was refreshing. The script and direction maintain a fast pace and I was never bored. In fact the film is a fascinating glimpse into power, the legal system, the rigors of research, evil, and virtue. I didn't have time to sink into despair.",

Haynes pumps the film so that it becomes full of paranoia and isolation, so that it matches the sensations experienced by the real protagonists (it is based upon a true story). As Bilott, Ruffalo could have amped up the glamour by playing a hotshot in order to flatter his A-list activist credentials (he also produced the film). But here, he deflates himself. He's sullen and awkward in his movements - when the stress piles up, his hands starts to violently shake. He doesn't present Bilott as an hero, but as a man who's been awakened to the world of moral decency, only to be rewarded with powerlessness and ineffectual anger. A part of thr mission is driven by the loyalty to his small-town roots, though his enemies soon use it as a weapon against him. Overall a masterpiece.",

            "content": "I'm even more appreciative than in the past of films that inspire us to be alert citizens, given the work we have ahead of us. And this is simply important work that should play in every home. I'm baffled to not see it among this year's Oscar crop, it's the type of film that is usually acknowledged over there. No matter. Everyone involved here deserves applause.It's a chemicals company being exposed this time, knowingly putting carcinogens in all of our homes and having covered it up for decades, but the gist of what matters is the same as every other time; people in high places lied, being negligent of human life, using layers of bureaucracy to hide away uncomfortable truth. Why care, really care, when studies can be stashed away, ignored for now, or responsibility passed along to some later committee, to be dealt with then? The good life of being a corporate executive is always enjoyed now and you are surrounded by its immediate benefits every day.It's important to be able to parse with these that it's not some intrinsic evil at play but the mundane stuff of greed and ignorance, indifference to a world outside our narrow bubble of comfort. As the case picks up publicity, we go on to see scientists on the company's payroll and ordinary people against their neighbor for causing trouble to their biggest jobs provider, although they're all being slowly poisoned.I've said it before, but what this world needs every time a scandal of this magnitude breaks out is deeply moral resolution. People really need to see in their living rooms news reports of CEOs arrested at home, trials where judges hand down life sentences, no ifs or buts. Not out of vindictiveness at rich guys, but out of moral urgency in the face of wrongdoing that is no longer allowed to be vague, or whisked from view behind legal settlements. The scale of wrongdoing here is so big we're really talking about crimes against humanity. We then wonder about populism and culture wars.It's because we don't get that, that films like this are a last resort. Is there a more satisfying scene this year than the one where the boss of the law firm, just as we think he's going to side with caution and his corporate clients, hammers home the need to do what''s right?This leads me to why this is rousing stuff in terms of mechanics of narrative, that is to say quite apart from the subject matter being worthy. It's not enough for the subject to be educative after all or for right to prevail eventually; we really need these to rouse us from our seat, dispel indifference.The good guys here we understand have been all this time on the side of bad guys. They know them on a first name basis, hobnob with them in cocktail parties and industry conventions. They have defended them in court before. It's seeing them take up the case against their former clients that inspires.Even so, our guy is working the case by himself, at first looked askance, merely tolerated. But just as we expect him to be eventually told off, ostracized, thwarted or fired, because of rattling important clients, he's allowed to go on. In the all important meeting to decide course of action, the boss is on his side. On opening day at court, he sits with colleagues who might never have bothered on their own, but there they are now with him, ready to defend right from wrong. Tacitly we understand that lawyerly knowledge that had been used to defend the bad guys, the reason there's so much contempt for the profession, is now going to be brought to bear for a just cause.The big speech that in a Capra film would have been reserved for the end here takes place midway through - and is shown as being delivered to various people.Among them are the company's executives who look glum and pensive, and this is where movies work. In a movie we can have the company executives look glum and pensive for us, coming to the realization that we would like them to.This is worthy stuff, born from the same great American tradition in narrative exposition that has seen even presidents held accountable. For all the gross negligence of their corporate world, Americans have by far the strongest journalistic practice in the world. With all that's going on these days, it's heartening to be reminded.",

During a meeting one day, a farmer that knows Rob's grandmother stops in to enlist his help. It seems that all of his livestock has become mysteriously ill and he has put most of them down. Once Rob starts down the rabbit hole, we see how giant corporations like DuPont only care about themselves. DuPont ends up exploiting the fact that a chemical they use to create Teflon is not listed with the government as hazardous and have spent years dumping it into the area surrounding this farmer's land. A quick side not, when the EPA set up their list of hazardous chemicals they relied on the companies that made them to submit lists to the government. This movie does tend to drag a bit at spots, but where we end up in the end is that DuPont ignored their own findings and kept pushing out products with this chemical in it, C8, knowingly poisoning the world. This is because of the fact that they made billions from its production. They ignored a court mediation decision and refused to help the people of the town that they poisoned. It is disgusting to say the least. I knew some of this story before watching this movie and have long tried my best to boycott anything made by DuPont. I encourage you all to do the same and to dispose of your Teflon coated pots and pans. It is estimated that 99% of all life forms on Earth now contain this chemical, which never breaks down.

Billot was a soldier of esteemed valor who literally went to war on a deadly battlefield contaminated with deadly toxins with an enemy that had caused indiscriminate deaths of men, women, and children.This movie revealed the rampant corruption within USDOJ, the most corrupted bureaucracy in the world.

He raises an alarm bell for the truth. But, in the end, he is punished for it, branded the enemy of the people.So too, Rob BIlott, a mild-mannered corporate attorney, had an awakening to defend the common folk who were being poisoned in the Parkersburg, West Virginia plant of the DuPont chemical corporation. Along with a supportive partner in the Taft law firm in Cincinnati, Bilott dedicates himself to demanding accountability from the insatiable greed of the titans of industry.In the bonus track of the DVD of the film, it is revealed that Bilott and members of the Parkersburg community participated in the film production. The most moving scenes in the film are those of an ordinary farmer, Wilbur Tennant, pleading his case and convincing Bilott that he is worthy of legal representation.The production values of the film were excellent with a dark, subdued lighting that evoked the nightmare into which Bilott was plunging. The film artists described the care that was taken in the contrasting environmental approaches to recreating Cincinnati and Parkersburg in the late 1990s.After years of struggle and a toll taken on his family and health, Bilott finally marshaled enough evidence to take DuPont to court case by case. Eventually DuPont caved in with a class action settlement of 3,535 cases for $670.7 million. It is now accepted in the scientific community that Teflon is a dangerous substance and that 99% of humans have some degree of PFOA in their systems, thanks to DuPont.For Rob Bilott, the struggle continues, and he still fights the good fight, standing up for the Wilbur Tennants of the world.",

            "content": "Famed for his impressive dramas such as Carol and Far From Heaven, Dark Waters is further proof that director Todd Haynes can handle a serious tale as good as anyone, even if this based on a true story effort lacks the energy or verve to enhance it to any level above solid lawyer drama 101.A passion project for its lead actor Mark Ruffalo, who delivers an impressively dialed back turn as stoic and almost robotic Virginian raised lawyer Rob Billot, Haynes and his leading man explore the real life journey of Billot, who by chance ended up spending the better part of his career investigating and bringing to light the shady dealings of chemical company DuPont, who were seemingly knowingly putting its workers and wider community at risk through a series of careless decisions and practices.Covering an extensive time-frame from the late 90's deep into the 2000's, Dark Waters has a lot of ground to cover in its exploration of Billot's mission to uncover the truth about DuPont's dealings after Bill Camp's struggling farmer Wilbur Tennant comes into his offices and tells him about the possible DuPont cover ups that have affected his land and stocks health and it's in this aspect that Dark Waters struggles too really bring its narrative home as the film lacks any of those big moments we would expect from such an incendiary true life tale.Filmed throughout in an almost exclusively bleak and grey hue, the film feeling like it was born out of the All the Presidents Men 70's era of this type of procedural film, Dark Waters has barely a moment of respite from its own depressive dealings that covers Haynes directional effort which lacks any type of flair or vitality, instead comfortable to let its characters talk it out, noticeable in the films most extended exciting sequence that inter-cuts Billot talking to Anne Hathaway's short-changed wife Sarah about the findings he is uncovering about the DuPont company and other situations.In many ways the plain and bland execution suits this sombre story well but as a cinematic exercise it doesn't always allow Dark Waters to become the experience it may have been had more energy and attention been placed on its final product, as while its thought-provoking and well-acted (especially by scene stealing performances from Camp and a best in years Tim Robbins), you can't help but escape the feeling that an overwhelming sense on keeping everything very grounded also held Dark Waters back from becoming the next big true life justice tale.Final Say -You will walk away from Dark Waters with a different perspective on modern day companies and a likely look through your kitchen's utensils, yet while Haynes film is at all times watchable and other times utterly gripping, its lack of energy or enthusiasm makes for a bleak viewing experience.3 \u00bd blackened teeth out of 5",

Not just under Republicans, mysteriously the EPA failed to act under both Clinton and Obama. When a company is making a $1 billion a year profit from just one of it's products then it will have deep pockets to defend itself. In 1998 Robert Bilott (Mark Ruffalo) was a corporate lawyer who had been just made a partner in firm which specialised in defending chemical companies. Then a farmer neighbour of his grandmother called with a strange tale of dead and diseased cattle. Thus began a journey for Bilott both physical, moral, psychological and professional. It would consume his life for years, cost him money and almost his marriage. After the case moved on to the mass poisoning of people through water pollution, DuPont tried to bury him in paperwork and suborned the west Virginia State Government to change water Safety Standards.The narrative of this film is best explained through observing what happened to Wilbur Tennant (Bill Camp) the farmer, His cows were developing tumors and dying, he was suffering from mysterious ailments. As the case progressed his house was burgled, records stolen, DuPont helicopters circled his house constantly. Becoming crazed he threatened them with a shotgun. Great performance from camp as he has to shoot a crazed cow which charges him. The personal cost to Sarah Bilott (Anne Hathaway, Robert's wife,) is vividly portrayed, she had given up her career as an lawyer to raise their children. She has to deal with his obsessions and to remind him that he isn't the only one making sacrifices. Se comes to comprehend the nature of the battle they both face.The film unfolds like a thriller holding your attention as new facts are revealed and more obstacles crop up. Directed by Todd Haynes from a screenplay by Mario Correa and Matthew Michael Carnahan. 9/10.",

The script is very intelligent, conveying all its information with a brilliant adamant tone, that is truly inspiring. That being said, the film can be a bit dull to watch at times, with the pacing slowing to a crawl at times. However, even with its slow nature, Dark Waters is able to tell its story at an impressive feat, by keeping it well natured, well acted, and incredibly thought provoking, without ever shoving an overabundance of information down the audiences throats. In the end, Dark Waters can be slow at times, but it's an incredibly smart film, and impressive work from Director Haynes, Ruffalo, and all involved.\nMy Rating: 9.5/10",

The second should be, corporate America is rotten to the core along with those who take my vote and pretend to represent me.But what of the actual screen drama?Mark Ruffalo can do ernest very well and here he delivers what is required but no more really. Tim Robbins and Ann Hathaway provide able support in underwritten roles and Hathaway in particular is a little flat in her portrayal of the loyal wife. The real acting credit goes to Bill Camp as the enraged farmer who brings the case of his poisoned animals to Ruffalo and is the needle that pricks his corporate armour; Camp puts over the anger, the powerlessness, the tragedy and the dignity of the character effortlessly and leaves an indelible print on the film.The pacing is slow, too slow really, about 20 minutes too slow and it made me think maybe this would have worked better as a mini series like The Looming Tower. Part of the problem is the nature of the story (17 years!) so for large chunks of time nothing really happens and supporting players, like Bill Pullman, come and go without you really knowing what they are about. Similarly with the stress on the main character, both in terms of his family life where his family goes from one baby to three teenage boys, and his job where he takes pay cuts to fund the case; these are just reference points, dropped in for dramatic post marking but not explored.The biggest problem is the lack of an engaging central character around whom the narrative can revolve and so make the audience stay the distance for the serious stuff. The most obvious comparitor is Erin Brockovich where the crimes of corporate America are no less heinous but it is the central character that makes you take notice. Viewers still talk about Brockovich now and remember the film was about cancer from poisoned water, in a similar number of years forward it is unlikely viewers will be remembering Dark Waters which is a crying shame.",

Their poisons, the PFOA - also known as C8 - which is not produced by nature, lasts forever and is found almost everywhere, even into the Arctic, as well as the PFOS, which is an endocrine disruptor and a pollutant listed in the Stockholm Convention on Persistent Organic Pollutants are both components of Teflon, which has poisoned 99% of mankind and is the source of countless numbers of cancers around the world.Dupont's management has been aware of the toxicity and the damage caused by their products since the middle of the twentieth century, but they have knowingly continued to destroy the health and lives of entire populations ever since. They have kept lying and attempted to cover up and minimize their responsibility as cancer victims have been dying during this dragging trial.This wonderful man of justice - brilliantly embodied by Mark Ruffalo - has not stopped fighting for more than twenty years against what constitutes nothing less than crimes against humanity, perpetrated by white-collar psychopaths, and sends us this essential message: The worst is not even them, but those of us who systematically deny facts and refrain from condemning what destroys our environment and ourselves out of sheer hypocrisy and cowardice.",

What is worse is their internal knowledge of the dangers to health many of their products had great potential to cause. Why would any entity do such beyond greed? Because with immense money comes hubris and grandiosity. In other words...\"we're untouchable\"/Dark Waters is an excellent drama based on the real legal fight to expose Dupont's deadly Teflon product itself as well as it's myriad disease inducing by-products. In the film you feel the sense of futility in taking on the behemoth corporation whose deep-pockets and callous maneuvering often seemed impenetrable. Mark Ruffalo is perfect as the reluctant, yet dogged, attorney who suffered through over a decade and myriad downturns to expose Dupont's criminal negligence. You feel a bit of the turmoil and pain just watching the man as he suffers his own declining health in the bargain. This is a screenplay sans Hollywood posturing and bombast. It feels honest as it shows the constant struggle to a finish line with the slimmest of chances for victory. The supporting cast is no slouch either. Tim Robbins as Ruffalo's boss is excellent. It should also be noted the producers have included some of the real people who suffered under the umbrella Dupont Corporation cast.In closing though there was a reckoning of sorts one might call an ultimate victory we're reminded Dupont made for years over a billion dollars profit from just Teflon. Teflon, a product I'd say almost 100% of us let into our homes using to our detriment unknowingly. The fact that most of us have elements of this product in our blood feels like a crime of unprecedented proportions. I can truly say this film made me disgusted with hate for Dupont. In this way it's a film everyone should see and take note of.",

Here, the subject is corporate malfeasance on a major scale and at over two hours, the movie definitely takes its time methodically documenting the investigation the hero conducts, including a montage that involves poring over mountains of evidence for months, then years.If this sounds boring then, well, it almost is. In real life, holding power to account is often a thankless task that involves serious mental labor of piecing together clues that don't make sense for a very long time - it is mind-numbing, repetitive work that involves paper and legalese.But at the same time, the film acquires a kind of magnetic pull as the scale of what Mark Ruffalo's character is unraveling begins to shine through its cold and still sheen. While I wish the story had more urgency - more momentum - the few scenes where a character delivers a powerful speech meant to provide that dramatic jolt feel false. Ultimately, Dark Waters is a good movie because for the most part it sticks to its commitment to documenting the burdens of public service as they really are - not grand and dramatic, but thorough, deliberate, and ultimately cumulative. The scenes in which the protagonist encounters and grows to know the residents of the areas most profoundly affected by the polluting Dupont chemical company, some played by the residents themselves, remind us of the human cost so often obscured by legal and bureaucratic language (e.g. \"receptacle\" stands in for \"humans\" in one of Dupont's pollution reports).In the end, Dark Waters is an account of the work corporations do to distance themselves from the human suffering they cause and of managing the excesses of capitalism through research and law.",

It does not matter what they did to try and stop him he still goes on, he managed to at least get some damages from the corporation after 100,000 plus people were affected. The United States Environmental Protection Agency blamed the farmer for animals ill health until full facts were public. What are PFAS?

I thought it's going to be sorted out but it's not, it took time to remove CFC and protect ozone. People used to drink water with bacteria that made them ill, but we today have high standards for water purification is what we believe.

It's based on an actual case where a young lawyer, (Mark Ruffalo, looking glum as well he might), working for a prestigious Cincinatti law firm who sued DuPont on behalf of a farmer, (Bill Camp, excellent), who claimed DuPont were poisioning his cattle and that was just the tip of the iceberg. It was a classic David versus Goliath scenario and Hayes, working with his usual cameraman Ed Lachman and a very good cast, (Tim Robbins, Anne Hathaway, Mare Winnigham, Bill Pullman, Victor Garber), has made a serious picture rather than a thriller. Unfortunately, as a piece of cinematic journalism, it's not in the same class as \"All the President's Men\" or \"Spotlight\" perhaps because we've seen it all before in one form or another.

You could really see her acting wheels turning in her head. Not a very natural performance unfortunately. Tim Robbins was good but the best performance came hands down from Bill Camp.

MDH was lead at the time by a former 3M executive. PFAS was a chemical of concern but not regulated by any entity as there was no toxicological data for it.This is a must see film! It is heartening to see the wheels of activism and the court system finally work in the public interest for a change. The performances are excellent and the insanity of how this country balances environmental health against corporate profits is laid out for all to see. There are over 80,000 registered chemicals that are for sale in the world and less than 20 percent have any health or environmental toxicological research associated with them. Why? Because the law makes it the burden of regulators to prove there is an adverse health impact rather than the entity that makes the chemical responsible for doing this work before being allowed to sell it.PFAS is one of these chemicals for which there was no toxicity research associated with it. It was a chemical of concern due to its chemical properties of environmental persistance and bioaccumulation. However, it was completely unregulated and could be disposed along with regular waste.There are tens of thousands more chemicals that are widely sold and used for which there is no data and unregulated.

There's a lot of that type of carry on in the film.This is one of those films that you're glad you've seen after it's finished, but you're also glad you'll never have to sit through again. You know the story now and that is enough. It's a very dry and factual retelling. There are never any \"wow\" moments. Mark Ruffalo puts in a solid performance but nothing more.

The film surprised me at how beautiful its visuals was, it had stunning views of the city landscape, it had some really interesting close up shots in particular in the office with the multiple blinds, and largely the movie was just beautiful to watch with many interesting set locations as well. Also the film managed to execute a uncomfortable tone pretty well, when it did actually go into detail about the effect of the water being polluted the film did an excellent job at making the audience know just how bad the c8 was. They largely managed to execute this well with the use of graphic and disturbing imagery that really stuck with you when watching.Next I thought the film had a lot of pacing inconsistencies and I had a lack of connection to the emotion and conflict. For me the films pacing was just all over the place. There was parts that were really slow when and my interest was sadly not there throughout the movie consistently, but also I felt like they rushed some important parts of the movie as well, conversations between important people and what was supposed to be key emotional moments lasted a few seconds and then they moved on causing a disconnect emotionally for me in places. This is largely due to the fact that I think they stuffed to much plot into the movie and it didn't completely work. And the attempted conflict between the family just felt tacked on for me and they tried to add more to it, but for me this steered away from what should have been the main focus of the movie which was the poison in the water killing people and turning more into a melodramatic family drama towards the end which was a shame.Next I thought that there was likeable lead characters with great chemistry and the performances from Mark Ruffalo and Anne Hathaway were fantastic. Both the characters of Rob Billet and Sarah Bilott were incredibly likeable throughout. You couldn't help but respect Rob for his passion at wanting to protect the people that were being harmed and the lengths he was willing to go in order for him to achieve this so this was well done. And Sarah was also very likeable, as due to the social context of the time still being fairly sexist, Sarah rose above the men that took advantage of her or didn't pay he attention and stuck with her husband and stood her ground in a fairly male dominated film. They also had great chemistry as husband and wife as well, with their relationship feeling organic and believable with its up and downs throughout. And the performances from both Mark and Anne were fantastic, with both putting on believable and passionate performances that really made you connect with their characters.My next two positives would the films good character development and its excellent themes on power. The films character development with Mark Ruffalo's character was excellent. He was so passionate and so willing to do whatever it took to prove he was right was executed excellently. Whatever push back e received he always came back with something bigger and better truly making you believe in his character. Also, the films theme on power was excellent and eye opening. The film tackled some big issues with the company Dupont, and the fact that this was a movie based off real events and a real company was scary. And the fact that they were so willing to put the blame on others or cover up their tracks in any way possible was a big reflection of the power system of today and other powerful companies and people.However my final two negatives that made dark waters a bit disappointing for me would be that there was to many characters with a lack of depth and development and I felt like they actually played it fairly safe with the films conflict and main issue of water pollution. The film just had to many characters that were just in the film for the sake of being there. It just made it slightly difficult to connect with the movie as there was so many characters that I just simply didn't care about so I thought this was a shame and could have been condensed to a certain amount of characters. And finally I actually thought the movie played it safe with its conflict and issues. For me it felt like they were holding back In showing the true effects of what the poisoning does to people beyond just being told which I thought was a shame and instead for me they decided to rely more on melodramatic and generic family drama as the film went on which I found really frustrating as they had the foundations of a great message to spread and it was well executed in places but it fell flat and the focus was taken to much of it at the ending for me.Overall dark waters, has excellent character development, likeable characters and is visually striking, and has two excellent performances from both Mark Ruffalo and Anne Hathaway and manages to execute its message occassionly. But sadly is held back by its overstuffed plot and characters. Pacing issues and losing its main message by sadly playing it safe and going for a more family drama leading me to be slightly disappointed by the end result.",

            "content": "For some reason I wasn't fully familiar with this story. I had heard of the DuPont chemical company and that they had carried out some really bad work practises with chemicals harmful to humans and the planet! However I wasn't prepared for how bad and how much they really knew and for how long, stretching back decades into the past with some pretty horrific chemical trial testimony.The story to someone like me was extremely fascinating seeing it unfold before me, probably due to the fact that I really didn't know how it was gonna end. There are several really shocking parts to me that stick out. Firstly the amount of information that the company had and that they knew about the chemical in question. They knew that there were potentially negative effects to human health and due to the lovely fact that they were self-regualting meant that they could almost keep it to themselves and lie. It is surprising and not at the same time, of course a big company like this would do that............can you imagine the fallout from this if it came out in the 80's or 90's?? The other shocking part is how long it took to get anything done...........I don't know how faithful the film is to the real events but the fact that film more or less ends in 2015, is mind blowing considering it started in the late 90's. Makes wonder how I didn't know more about this??Mark Ruffalo is brilliant , prefect role for him to deep dive into and really sink his teeth into. He has got one of those traits about him as an actor, easily likeable......so it is no problem getting behind his cause. Im a sucker for any \"standing up for the small guy\" type of story and this one certainly delivers in that respect. Not Oscar worth probably but not every performance needs to be..........just a solid one.That sort of leads into my problem with the film, for such a complex, fascinating, heart breaking and shocking story.........this film feels a little under cooked. It needs more of everything.........not necessarily better actors.............but certainly a better script because it can get very clunky in places....I can imagine if your not enjoying this film it will get tedious. Potentially a bigger name director, not saying that Todd Haynes is not talented he is, directed one of my fav films \"Carol\", but maybe someone who is more inclined to this sort of story. There should have been more tension in the film or more driving force........something to keep you the edge of your seat, its called \"Dark Waters\" for crying out loud. I was maybe just expecting something a bit more like \"The Insider\" but unfortunately didn't get anywhere near.Overall though I did enjoy watching the film its a good solid film 70% of 100, good acting from everyone including Anne Hathaway and Mark Ruffalo.........directing was fine............maybe a little too slow on the pace now and then and certainly needed better script. I think its trying to hard to be Oscar bait and has fallen short of being a great film. None the less I would recommend it even if you do know the story.",

Every scene moves, every scene is important, every line integral. The film doesn't stop right up to the end.The cast is stacked, Mark Ruffalo is giving one of the best, most committed performances of his career, and probably would have been nominated in a year with a less stacked competition. Anne Hathaway is great, as always, Tim Robbins shows up for a bit and is great, Bill Camp again proves he's the most underrated actor working today. Victor Garber has only a few scenes, but brings a nuance and grit to everything he does, much like Bill Pullman and William Jackson Harper.I could go on and on, but you get the point. See. This.

The baby that's talked about in the film who has been permanently affected by the company that wasn't taking care of the water contamination actually cameos in the film too.

Wilbur Tennant gives Bob videos of what he sees what the cattle died of. Tennant blames Dupont and wants a lawyer to help clear this up.This is probably the strongest and most powerful story about an industrial giant, Dupont, polluting the waters near farms. The Hazard material called POA -8 and is used to make Teflon and the run off of this material is poured into 55-gallon drums and dumped in rivers where the drums eventually leak. Tennant knows Dupont is responsible because because his cows drink the water and die.Bob Bilott's boss, Tom Terp (Tim Robbins), at first doesn't want to go against Dupont, but later gives in and lets Bilott run with it and is convinced they have a case.But problems arise and Bob Bilott's efforts seem to go nowhere. Even his wife Sarah (Anne Hathaway) is against him until he sits her down and reads her the riot act.The whole tone of the movie is set by Wilbur Tannant played by Bill Camp when he approaches Bob Bilott. I would give Bill Camp an Oscar as Best Supporting actor as his rage is felt throughout this story.Notables: Victor Garber as Phil Donnelly, a Dupont Rep; Bill Pullman as lawyer Harry Dietzler who gives a very good performance in court near the end that Dupont is totally responsible for the deaths from POA; Mare Winningham as Darlene Kiger, who was told by Dupont to have a hysterectomy and she and her husband Joe (Richard Hagerman) have cancer.You need to see this story because although there have been TV shows with this plot, this story hits home better than all that went before.At the end of the movie we are told that POA is \"still in the blood of 99% of life on earth, and thousands of chemicals are still unregulated.\" In other words, this isn't over.This is a must see and all should question use of Teflon products. This movie should convince you of that. The is a very well told and well acted movie.

This is the second film Mark Ruffalo has appeared in dealing with the DuPont family. The first was Foxcatcher (2014). The cast are fantastic in their roles, encapsulating the desperation, frustration and etiquette that each of their positions require, ultimately, we move through the storyline through Ruffalo, who tends to dominate the screen, expressing his slow deterioration of emotions while also capturing a clear and utter determination to prove successful.The movie is based on \"The Lawyer Who Became DuPont's Worst Nightmare\"; by Nathaniel Rich and adopts a similar book-telling design to its on-screen finish, we as viewers are completely immersed in the world of events and are eager to find out more, it is truly captivating.A dark spectacle, covering a darker truth.",

Robert was nowhere near a dry cleaners. He had a seizure at work, in his boss' office after learning from Tom Terp(Tim Robbins), the Taft, Stennius & Hollister CEO, that he'll be expected to take another pay cut, his fourth pay cut. Robert's three boys attend a private Catholic school. The wife will be furious. This chemical company has made Robert allergic to family life. \"Dark Waters\", directed by Todd Haynes, is an unofficial sequel to his second film, \"Safe\", which partly put the onus on the victim, not the culprit, because the filmmaker didn't know who the culprit was. Twenty-five years later, we know, and \"Dark Waters\" names names. The science is in. Modern life can kill you. Although the doctor(Terri Clark) explains to Sarah Bilott(Anne Hathaway), herself, a corporate lawyer, who met Robert at his law firm, that Robert's problem was neurological, brain-related. The wife, however, has reservations about the preliminary analysis, having witnessed, first-hand, so much corporate malfeasance, the former workman's comp assassin-turned homemaker can't help but ask if there is any possibility that her husband might have been poisoned. Wilbur Tennant(Bill Camp), a farmer, taught the couple to never take anything at face value, since every action and inaction, at the end of the day, is profit-motivated. Only a man with a twelfth-grade education would know this. A rich man with a law degree from an Ivy League school doesn't know or cares that the system is rigged, because the system never let them down. But Robert Bilott didn't attend Harvard, or Yale, or even Dartmouth. In Goliath's eyes, Robert is David, too, no different from the farmer with the dead cows. \"Dark Waters\" is about a changed man's crusade against a Goliath in the chemical industry, who knowingly contaminated a backwater West Virginia town's drinking water supply with chlorofluorocarbons. Outside her husband's hospital room, Sarah chastises Tom for making Robert feel like a failure. \"You and I may not know what that is,\" she scolds the law firm's main partner, which means that Sarah doesn't care about the little man, but she cares about what her husband cares about. The \"is\", the audience knows, is roots. Robert Bilott went to Ohio State, a \"no-name\" school, according to James(William Jackson Harper), a Taft associate. Wilbur knows Robert's grandmother. That's because the hotshot lawyer grew up in rural West Virginia.It's all in the head, people keep trying to persuade Carol White(Julianne Moore), a privileged San Fernando Valley trophy wife, especially her general practitioner, Dr. Hibbard(Steven Gilborn), who refers his patient to a colleague; a \"shrink\", because whatever is ailing this otherwise \"healthy\" woman, it's not showing up on her x-rays. \"Safe\", Todd Haynes' second feature, was a horror film disguised as a social satire about the consumer culture that defined the late-eighties. Set in 1987, Haynes, a filmmaker trained in semiology, updates Brian Forbes' \"The Stepford Wives\", adapted from the Ira Levin novel, by tweaking the role of the homemaker. In the 1972 original, the women were domestic automatons, obsessing over housecleaning products and pleasing their breadwinning husbands in bed. These southern California wives have maids. They never have to lift a finger. Furniture, the audience suspects, gets them off, because they're shopping addicts and money is the drug. These Hispanic domestics clean the beautiful stuff their employers have bought and curated, which transforms their luxurious homes into temples of 20th century excess. Carol was one of them. At home, and this is because of Haynes' mastery of the mis-en-scene, the audience sees how this privileged woman must always be the focal point; her maid, Fulvia(Martha Velez), a mere planet constantly revolving around the sun, her mistress, always threatening the maid's elliptical orbit, because of their tilted symbiotic relationship. \"Fulvia! Fulvia!\" Carol calls offscreen, even though Fulvia is preoccupied, showing the new girl how to polish silverware. Carol can't find the telephone book. Finding it herself, in this milieu, counts as hard work, and the delegation of work, that's what the missus does. Carol overexerts herself; she sits down and asks Fulvia for a glass of milk. Through the kitchen opening, we see two men at work, painting a wall. Although visual cues are aplenty, in which exposure to chemicals and air pollutants(like car exhaust) provide evidence for this woman's degraded condition, the cause and effect is compromised by the audience's disdain for this somewhat problematic protagonist. On Carol's haler days, Fulvia would fetch the missus her milk, regardless, because power over the help is the only power she holds. It's hard to root for the idle rich. The filmmaker knows this. Carol has to prove that she's one of us before the audience can get behind her. That moment arrives during the baby shower sequence. Carol goes on the fritz, similar to the woman during the pool party scene in \"The Stepford Wives\", who walks aimlessly among the partygoers, repeating: \"I'll just die if I don't get this recipe.\" Haynes riffs on the concept of woman as malfunctioning human android into woman as alien. Carol, suddenly, feels like a stranger among the members of her very exclusive clique; an oncoming dread that blossoms into terror when she no longer can speak the shared language of her tribe. Carol knows the words, but not the music; she's still fluent, asking Linda(Susan Norman), her best friend: \"Did you wrap that?\" and, as if they're reading from a script, the self-aware knows the right way to respond: \"I've seen you wrap things.\" These women aren't talking; it's a pitch-perfect speech performance. Improvisation in \"Safe\" is double-edged, because it's not just the actors who stick to the script, so do the characters they play. This rote memory of correct things to say wipes Carol out. The audience thinks it's the carpet. She asks Barbara(Ronnie Farer) for the whereabouts of her bathroom. Wrong word. \"Powder room,\" Barbara corrects her guest. Once inside, she stares at herself in the mirror, a foreshadowing of the film's final scene. The perm, the makeup, the pretty dress; these things, Carol thinks, is not her. A glass of tap water sits on the countertop. Carol returns to the fold, managing to play her role in the good life for a little while longer. Barbara's daughter sits on the alien's lap, watching the future mother open another gift. Carol's breathing becomes labored. The child is frightened. Carol breaks script; she improvises. The alien can't breathe, like the living room suddenly turned into Mars. The host calls 911. An audience in 1995 could debate about the trigger. There are several suspects; the little girl's permed hair, carpet, sofa. air conditioner. 2019 audiences will see something different; tap water from the bathroom faucet.Chorale music is used as a sound bridge when \"Dark Waters\" transitions from the intensive care ward to a Catholic church. Did TIA kill the lawyer? In the pew, Carol and her three boys sing a hymn, followed by a series of expository shots, which surveys the cathedral's geography and congregation density, before ending with Robert, who sits slightly apart from his family near the aisle, in frame. So the father was there all along, hiding in the negative space, during that first shot of the incomplete Bilott family, when for an instant, the audience thinks they're witnessing a funeral. It's a variation on a theme, linking the corporate lawyer with Carol White; a thematic match, depicted through mis-en-scene, which shows how Robert is simultaneously close and far away from his family. In \"Safe\", the homemaker talks to Greg, her husband, and Rory, her stepson, from a different room, the kitchen, where she had volunteered to serve coffee for two. Instead of returning to the dining table, Carol lingers in a blind spot, from the family's perspective, as if she lost her way back. Robert, like Carol White, feels disconnected from his milieu. The corporate lawyer, too, meets new people and doesn't know who he is anymore. Robert ingratiates himself within a lower socioeconomic class, the denizens of Parkersburg, West Virginia, his clients, whereas the San Fernando Valley girl loses touch with her fancy, high-maintenance jetsetter friends to live with other chemically-sensitive people on a secluded commune in the New Mexico desert. Fifteen years later, since Wilbur Tennant interrupted Robert during a meeting at his law firm with a rambling monologue in an inpenetrable Appalachian dialect and a box of VHS tapes, the corporate lawyer has changed, and Sarah, despite loving her husband, calls him out. His physical body may be present, but the mind housed in that body, it's somewhere else, probably rural West Virginia. Sarah has to update this empty shell, doing a poor impersonation of the man she married, on the family and extended family's trials and tribulations. Carol White asks: \"Where am I? Right now?\" Robert is worse, because these are questions that never dawns on him to ask, and Sarah knows it.Dupont reneged on their promise to take care of the people they knowingly poisoned. The chemical giant tore up the contract, because they could afford to. The corporate giant expected Robert Bilott to back down. They didn't count on the lawyer having the wherewithal and perseverance to chip away at the thirty-five-hundred unsettled cases, one plaintiff at a time. The courtroom becomes his safe house. As a nod to the allegorical science fiction elements of \"Safe\", the judge announces: \"At this rate, we're going to be here 'til 2890 if we're lucky, so we better get started.\"Robert Bilott, a real-life Superman, is allergic to chemical...companies.",

So not exactly the best basis for an exciting movie. The story in general of the underdog fighting for people against the evil cooperation we have seen so often that we can predict how this goes and only question is will the lawyer succeed or not.Now the only thing that can make this more alive is the emotions! Why are there so little? This a story about poisoning a whole city for generations and the rest of the world. People dying left and right from chemical induced cancer. Ann Hathaway shoes some emotions but that is mostly because her husband is obsessed with this trial. Other than then that we don't really see suffering, sadness and grieve.

Beyond its resonant real-life story, though, is a narrative that's as exhausting as it is engaging. It mimics the drawn-out legal process that inspired it, being built of a series of cyclical successes and failures. It's frustrating, then elating, then saddening and so on. Because of this, though, it has a relatively uneven pacing. At its best, it's riveting. Often, it's ever-so-slightly repetitive and, even, dull. Still, its highs make up for its lows; it's probably the best way this story could've been told. It does a good job with its potentially 'dry' material and is typically entertaining throughout.

They give this speachy vibe were normal casual dialogue should have been and takes you a bit out of the movie sometimes.The fact that this movie is based on a true event, really makes everything the DuPont organisation does feel extra disgusting and really made me feel sad throughout the movie. The movie was a great eye-opener to see what lengths corporations will go to earn money but also the good in a man, that'll do anything to serve justice. The good and bad in the world portrayed in one movie.The movie feels a bit long though. They really wanted to show you every aspect of this trail. That also means the cases shift and the type of movie you are watching with it. From a detective story too a court drama. The movie has it's high points along the way but also it's low points where you just want to move on or feels like a scene is dragging out in my opinion.Overall the movie is competent and well made but the scope of the movie seemed a bit too big.

The worst thing about this is it affects human lives too often without their knowledge till it's too late. And the kicker is how nothing happens to the devils perpetrating these deeds.

A strong supporting cast added great value to the litigation process as well as to the human lives that were expressly reflective in this docudrama autobiographical film.What I am surprised about is whenever a producer of a United States film tries to handle as sensitively as humanely possible the impact of an environmental related accident/crime on United States citizen they never seem to compare themselves to other countries own environmental record(s). Let's take a simple example such as Chinese garlic which arrives somewhere in North America by a slow boat with the cheapest price tag in your grocery store compared to your locally grown garlic farmers. Have you ever wondered how and/or why Chinese grown garlic that that takes weeks or even months across the ocean to make it to your grocery store at less than half the price of locally grown garlic is so much cheaper. Hmmmm? I wonder how pure from contaminants that Chinese garlic is?I am not in the manufacturing industry nor am I a North American farmer. What I am is a retired male who takes great caution for the products I purchase not always looking for the cheapest price. Why you ask? Because we get what we pay for. Dupont shame on you!

It was a similar story to that of Erin Brockovich, but instead of a busty, ballsy woman, the protagonist is a schlubby lawyer who is just trying to do the right thing. I also wonder if people are so inured by the awfulness of the world, with every day bringing a new horror, that the true story of DuPont purposefully poisoning citizens in West Virginia just can't find room to get on people's radar. I wonder if we are so inured to the depravity of corporations in their search of profit, that this story doesn't resonate more widely. I'd definitely recommend catching it on streaming.",

I mean - everyone loves money but to go out of your way and destroy the lives of thousands of residents is just psychotic - if the government / law isn't going to step in and help people immediately then don't be surprised to see so many anti-government/legal movements.This is definitely a must watch - hopefully someone will be inspired to stop these types of incidents from happening again.I'd also recommend checking out - Civil Action (John Travolta); Erin Brockovich (Julia Roberts); Fahrenheit 11/9 (Michael Moore); and, Chernobyl (HBO TV Series).",

If you thought the film was suspenseless, you probably weren't paying much attention.The images are calm, with diffuse lighting, and the music - although not the most inspired score - builds steadily without drawing the focus away from the subject. It adds to the clarity of the message. Dark Waters submerges the viewer in the uncomfortable confronting reality of injustice and powerlessness.You won't come out of this one unscathed.

            "content": "I saw the trailer for this film inspired by real events a couple of times in the cinema, I was initially interested because of the good cast, but I became more so because of the subject matter, directed by Todd Haynes (Safe, Far from Heaven, Carol). Based on the true story, in Cincinnati, Ohio, corporate defence lawyer Robert \"Rob\" Bilott (Mark Ruffalo) works for law firm Taft Stettinius & Hollister. He is approached by farmer Wilbur Tennant (Bill Camp), who knows Robert's grandmother, asking him to investigate a number of unexplained deaths in Parkersburg, West Virginia. Tennant connects the deaths to the chemical manufacturing corporation DuPont and gives Robert a large case of videotapes. Rob visits Tennant's farm, where he learns that 190 cattle have died with unusual medical conditions such as bloated organs, blackened teeth, and tumours. DuPont attorney Phil Donnelly (Titanic's Victor Garber) tells him he is not aware of the case but will help in any way he can. Robert files a small suit so he can gain information of the chemicals dumped on the site. He realises the chemicals might not be regulated by the EPA (Environmental Protection Agency) after failing to find anything useful in the EPA report. Rob confronts Phil at an industry event, leading to an argument. DuPont sends Rob hundreds of boxes, hoping to bury the evidence. Robert finds numerous references to PFOA, a chemical with no references in any medical textbook. He later discovers that PFOA is perfluorooctanoic acid, used to manufacture Teflon and used in American homes for non-stick pans. DuPont has been running tests of the effect of PFOA for decades, finding that it causes cancer and birth defects, but these findings were not made public. They dumped hundreds of gallons of toxic sludge in the river that flows through Tennant's farm. PFOA and similar compounds are forever chemicals, harmful chemicals that do not leave the blood stream and slowly accumulate. Tennant has been shunned by the community for suing their biggest employer, and, although advised by Rob, he refuses to accept DuPont's settlement, wanting justice. Tennant tells Rob he and his wife Sandra (Denise Dal Vera) both have cancer. Robert sends the DuPont evidence to the EPA and Department of Justice, among others. The EPA fines DuPont $16.5 million. But Robert is not satisfied; he knows the residents of Parkersburg will suffer the effects of the PFOA for the rest of their lives. He plans a large class-action lawsuit and seeks medical monitoring for all residents of Parkersburg. However, DuPont sends a letter notifying residents of the presence of PFOA, thus delaying any further action. Rob's team argues that PFOA is not regulated and the corporation is liable, as the amount in the water was a higher unsafe amount than stated in DuPont's internal documents. In court, DuPont claims their later study found that amount contained is safe. The locals protest and the news story goes national. DuPont agrees to settle for $70 million. Scientists need to prove that PFOA causes the ailments, so medical monitoring and date is required. The locals are told they can get their settlement money after donating blood. Nearly 70,000 people donate to the study. Seven years pass with no result from the study. Tennant dies and Rob is hit by pay cuts, straining his marriage with wife Sarah (Anne Hathaway). Rob collapses, shaking, after Tom Terp (Tim Robbins) tells he needs to take another pay cut. Doctors tell Sarah he suffered an ischemia (a restriction in blood supply to tissues), brought on by stress. Sarah tells Tom to stop making Rob feel like a failure, since he is doing something for people who need help. The scientific review contacts Rob and confirm that PFOA, or \"C8\" as it is also known, causes multiple cancers and other diseases. At dinner with his family, Robert is informed that DuPont is going back on the entire agreement. Rob decides that, one at a time, he will take each defendant's case to DuPont. He wins the first three multimillion-dollar settlements against DuPont, and DuPont settles the class action for $671 million. DuPont became defunct in 2017, but the ailments of these manufactured chemicals have made their way into the blood of 99% of all human beings. Also starring Bill Pullman as Harry Dietzler, Mare Winningham as Darlene Kiger, Midsommar 's William Jackson Harper as James Ross and Louisa Krause as Carla Pfeiffer. The performances are all fine, and the script was just about understandable for me, it does make you realise the severity of this contamination to humanity and the lack of care of powerful corporations, average a lot of the time, but dramatic when it needs to be, a good enough legal thriller.

It is a very powerful film with a deep meaning on what really goes on behind the big logos we see on a daily basis, no one knows the hidden agenda of these big companies & what there out for, its all about money & profit.The first half of the film is about building the story & finding out what is going on, a farmer is desperate to get a lawyer to pursue as to why his cows are dying, chemicals are the culprit. So Mark Ruffalo who plays Bob in the film, decides to take this case on & has to go through a insane amount of paper work & documents to find out what the company's have hidden, it makes for a really interesting watch as he finds out little bit of evidence here & there to help his case while mostly everyone is against him. The film keeps you so hooked on what the outcome is going to be & through the film the years pass with not much happening as it just shows how hard it is to pursue these companies.Couple of bloopers i found in the film, in 2012 Bob was still using a brick Motorola phone, I'm sorry but in 2012 we had the iPhone 5, also the same cars were used in the film throughout the years which again they would of changed, especially in the later years of the film but i won't nit pick.But overall it was a really good watch with a deep meaning on what the bigger picture is & till this day they are still fighting for cases & that this chemical is a forever chemical.

            "content": "I am not sure if there is are enough movies like \"Erin Brockvich\" and this one to warrant a genre of \"David and Goliath\". In my headline, I used plural for \"David\" because while this case started out as a class action, it ended up as several thousand individual cases because Dupont tried to muscle the plaintiffs into giving up.Rather than a courthouse drama, the movie unfolds almost like a detective procedural, meticulous but by no means dull. And there are a couple of scenes with theatrics dramatization.When our Quixotic hero Rob Bilott (Mark Ruffalo) is discussing the situation with farmer Wilbur Tennant (Bill Camp) at his contaminated farm, the latter yells \"Stop\"! Bilott protests \"I am trying to help\". \"Don't move\" comes Tennant's urgent reply as he grabs a shotgun. A cow that has apparently gone mad is positioning herself to charge.Another dramatic scene is staged at a polar opposite venue, a high-class fund-raising function. Bilott approaches Dupont tycoon Phil Donnelly (Victor Garber), trying to get his attention on the potential earth-shattering devastation of the contamination cover-up. With so many other important matters to attend to, Donnelly barks \"Sue me\". Without missing a beat comes Bilott's retort, \"I am already suing you\". The ensuing heated exchange is heard by the entire gathering at the pre-function cocktail.As details of the Dupont-PFOA (a chemical)-Teflon case is fully available in the public domain, I wouldn't go into it.Ruffalo's portrayal of Bilott is spot-on. Tim Robbin gives a measured (but not without flare) performance as his supportive (albeit reluctantly) boss. Camp's portrayal of the defiant, dying (of cancer from the contamination) farmer is heart-breaking. Garber, known better to us fans as one half of the superhero \"Firestorm\", is one hell of a classy villain here. Anne Hathaway, playing Bilott's enduring and somewhat stereotyped wife, has not been given much material to work with. There is one short scene in which she shines.",

            "content": "\"Dark Waters\" is the Hollywood dramatisation of the history and background of recent multiple law suits raised by crusading lawyer Robert Bilott against American pharmaceutical giant DuPont for knowingly allowing the contamination of water predominantly in Parkersburg, Ohio with horrendous side-effects on the neighbouring human and animal life. After several years of investigation culminating in long-time-processing medical tests involving almost 70000 local inhabitants, it was at last conclusively stated that there was a causal link between the reckless profligacy of DuPont in dumping waste materials into the local ecological system and the resultant incidence of all manner of illnesses and physical defects of inhabitants in the area, principally cancer.It all begins when a local farmer, himself in ailing medical health, his livestock ravaged by unexplained maladies including blackened teeth and cancerous tumours, approaches big-time lawyer Bilott, played by Mark Ruffalo and implores him to take his case and seek to lay blame at the door of DuPont, the town's biggest employer. Bilott, a newly created partner in the town's venerable law practice, is initially sceptical of the claims particularly as his own firm has amicable links to DuPont at the highest level, but the smiling condescension he initially receives both from his own company and DuPont's management changes as he digs deeper and uncovers a sinister conspiracy. By his own dogged perseverance, over a period of several years, assisted in this by a married couple in the neighbourhood who alert him to DuPont's underhand method to utilise the Statute of Limitations to kick the case out, he has to convince his fellow partners and his own wife even at the risk of his own failing health, to eventually submit a prosecution.The film is shot in natural, often murky light as befits the film's double-meaning title, emphasising the everyday background to the case. Only occasionally does director Todd Haynes resort to flashy technique, like an extended tracking shot of Ruffalo going into work, the shaky subjective scene when he suffers his mini-stroke and in particular a bizarre sideways/top-down shot of him walking along a passage which will have you almost falling out of your chair, instead rightly heightening the realism of the story and the characters.Once or twice, sensationalism does raise its unwelcome head, like when Ruffalo hesitatingly turns on his car ignition and the camera pulls back for the expected explosion shot which doesn't come, plus did DuPont really fire-bomb a house to attempt to murder hostile witnesses and some of the speeches err on the sound of grandstanding or sound-bites but in the main Haynes lets the story itself drive the film and it's plenty big enough to do that. Haynes also doesn't posit a single figurehead of hate in the DuPont organisation as an easy mark for the viewer instead emphasising the facelessness of the imposing corporate enemy Bilott is taking on.Ruffalo of course played a not dissimilar role as a truth-seeker in \"Spotlight\" and he carries off the part here of the solitary indefatigable crusader with commendable veracity. He gets good support from a similarly dressed-down Anne Hathaway as his initially reactionary but later fully supportive wife, while behind them there's strong, unflashy support from the rest of the cast.The latest in a long line of Hollywood documentary-realism movies exposing high crimes and misdemeanours, taking in \"The Post\", \"Spotlight\", \"Erin Brockovich\" and the grandaddy of them all \"All The President's Men\" \"Dark Waters\" is a solidly commendable addition to that particular pantheon.",

Unfortunately, the production process in making teflon caused enormous local environmental damage in the town where this process was based, and specific health risks to those on the production line, dangers which Du Pont knowingly concealed for many years. The film depicts the lengthy legal battle to first expose the scandal, then to fight for compensation for the victims. Mark Rufallo plays the lawyer who reluctantly takes on the case, then gets drawn in deeper and deeper, as he slowly uncovers the scale and depth of what is involved, despite the cost to his career and the strain on his marriage. Although Rufallo may be more earnest than charismatic in the role, this enables the case to be the story, rather than the film being a vehicle for the star. In a tale that is as complex and lengthy as this, there are inevitably going to be simplifications and short-cuts, of characters and events. However, the fact that Du Pont ended up paying out $670million in compensation claims suggests that this was corporate negligence on a grand scale, and justifies the film for bringing the story powerfully to the public's attention.",

I was quite unpleasantly surprised to know that corporate conspiracy theories they love to turn into films are actually closer than I thought.I'm not sure that this film was helpful to me, but I'm glad that now I know a little more about state regulations when it comes to protecting your health in the modern world. I'm pretty sure that in my country my health is constantly in danger and there is no way I would ever be able to take any sort of legal action about it. Makes you really appreciate the rule of law when you see one (even with all the corruption that wasn't shown in the film itself for some reason).As for the film itself, it was a little too long and quite boring at times, Ruffalo's acting was confusing but Hathaway can't act at all so it was fine in comparison. I appreciate the fact that they've included real people who were involved, especially Bucky Bailey and Rob Bilott himself. I actually thought that Bucky was a character created for the screenplay but no, he is real.Sometimes you feel like you're reading a book and not watching a film, a less textual adaption would've been better in my opinion. Also, the motivations of other lawyers were too idealistic, I mean, Tim Robbins' monologue about duty wasn't believable at all. I mean, in the real world, money is still a thing. Also, the company (companies) are never portrayed as evil, which is both good and bad. A more evil huge company would've been better for the story, but in reality, they were only protecting their investments and profits they are making in total and complete disregard for the safety of the people. They also never felt that menacing or allpowerful.Overall, I'd recommend this film for at least one viewing. It's not super deep or groundbreaking, but it shows just how many things affect our health and some of these we aren't even aware of (yet).",

            "content": "Dark WatersI enjoyed this movie overall but it is a dry as dust biopic about a large drug company's abuse of power over many years, so it will not be everyone's cup of tea. Set in a small rural town in deepest Virginia these little guys had little chance against the might of an international conglomerate defending it's reputation with unlimited financial resources. This was a carefully constructed movie from start to finish, it breathed in all the right places, with strong central performances and we were spoilt by other strong cameo performances. I do object to overtly political movies, and this movie was careful not to be so, it was (I would hope) largely revealing an historical abuse of corporate power.I see a formula to these movies emerging, combined with a lack of action and repetitious scenes.small guy complains,\nconcerns brushed off,\nsomeone champions cause,\nmountains of paperwork,\nlong hours,\nfamilies under pressure,\ncourt case,\nfinally wins in court,\ncompensation,\nphotos of real people.This is perhaps the 4th movie in 6 months unveiling corporate corruption, I'm getting bored.The acting was good, Mark Ruffallo is meticulous in his craft but his technical proficiency prevents an emotional attachement to the viewer, perhaps it is me, but he fails to move me and lacks charisma, and when this is juxtaposed with the performances of both Tim Robbins and Anne Hathaway who totally dominated their scenes, with suspressed anger, frustration and raw emotion, it just all happened behind the eyes the micro gestures. The movie is worth watching for Tim Robbins alone for his complex interpretation of a conflicted lawyer trying to support his friend and colleague.Of course, behind all these cases lies unchecked capitalism that followed from all the markets opening up under Reagan and Thatcher, this was a unique time in history when for the first time we had the beginning of globalised markets with companies truly spanning international borders without any effective external supervision of their operations. Let us hope that slowly scrutiny and regulation bites at the greatest excesses of these monopolistic companies but I am sure there is more to uncover.",

However, the over emphasis of the 'difficult' relationship the lawyer has with his firm, the lacuna in the lawyer's memory about something it is claimed really mattered to him as a child. No sorry. Hits the too fake, backstory filling blah blah button. At times, the film drones on as you wait for these formalities to be gotten over with. No actor is especially outstanding, not a surprise as there is nothing to run with. Nevertheless, the film carries an important message though. Perhaps this film should have ended on the occurrence of a separate legal challenge with a different manufacturer elsewhere in the US over other pollution issues. There's thousands of them, and they continue to arise. Nothing is solved. Nothing is changed. The story is eternal.",

It's heartbreaking to see small-town innocent people being exploited to benefit a large corporation like Dupont, and hits close to home for many of us. Everyone should watch this movie to understand more deeply the corruption occurring in the US between our government, judicial system, and large corporations like Dupont.",

            "content": "STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday MorningIn 1998, Rob Bilott (Mark Ruffalo) is approached by Wilbur Tennant (Bill Camp), a farmer from the small town he grew up in in West Virginia. Wilbur is a friend of Rob's mother, and his cows have been dying in his fields, which he believes is caused by overspill caused by the local landfill, owned and operated by chemical company Du Pont. Rob mentions this at a charity dinner to DuPont attorney Phil Donnelly (Victor Garber) and is met with hostility. Determined to get to the bottom of the matter, he encounters a dark truth behind the existence of DuPont's signature creation Teflon, and how the whole town may have been poisoned by the chemical C8 over the years.Of all the thriller catagories that appear on screen, the 'legal' thriller is one that has never really gained much mass appeal. Whilst John Grisham's novels have enjoyed some favorable translation to screen, that may be on account of being derived from the source material, but generally they're inevitably laden with legal jargon, alienating those not caught up in that world, leaving appeal only to those who are. With this in mind, Dark Waters is further constrained by being trapped within the confines of a true life tale, reducing any overly dramatic exposition or theatrical behaviours.Ironically, the film finds itself detailing real life events from 1998, in which one of only a few other such films I can remember, in the shape of another true life legal thriller, A Civil Action, was released (and is referenced somewhere in this film) which covered pretty similar themes. Both films emerge much the same way, interesting, distracting but ultimately forgettable, covering interesting events told in not the most exciting way. Director Todd Haynes saturates the whole thing in dark, gloomy lighting throughout, adding to the dull, grey feel of the events. An impressive supporting cast, including Anne Hathaway, Tim Robbins and Bill Pullman, ultimately overshadow a typically over theatrical Ruffalo, hamming it up a bit in the lead.It's a competent, decent thriller, while you're not likely to need to see it twice, the shocking true life events it depicts will leave you as shattered and cynical as real life often does over fiction. Oh, and being set in that town, John Denver's classic 70s country anthem (about being Taken Home) is of course treated to a full blast, right out Ruffalo's car radio. ***",

You have to actually google 'old dupont' in order for the correct wikipedia page to come up with all the evil deeds that DuPont has done. It's all very disgusting tbh.Anyway... the movie is good. I wouldn't say it's as good as 'The Big Short' but it still gets the message across and delivers the information that you want to see. I hardly recognised Anne Hathaway though (they made her look ugly). Both Hathaway and Mark Ruffalo deliver good performances and they even have a few of the ORIGINAL people in the movie as actors, which I really like in docu-movies like this.Overall it's a fine film and it left me even more angry than I was previously at huge chemical companies and the evil things they've done over the years (like Monsanto, DuPont, Bayer, etc).",

Another thing I learned is that unless somebody brings a case like this into the open to where everyone can see it no one will know what is happening in their day to day lives. Another thing in the movie is that nobody is happy that this case is going on because they don't believe Robert until they get a blood test and now they care and want to know what is happening to them. So they start getting mad at him for people dying in their lives that were going to happen anyway. Everyone must see this movie. It is very interesting and informative. It sheds light on things that companies do that most people do not know about at all. This movie relates to chemistry because it is about chemicals like c-8 also called PFOA. They talk about how chemicals can hurt animals and people. Changes I am going to make in my life are checking to see if some of the things I eat have forever chemicals in them.

Regarding the interpretations of the cast, I have to mention the interpretation of Mark Ruffalo who played as Rob Bilott and he was simply outstanding. Some other interpretations that have to be mentioned were Tim Robbins' who played as Tom Terp and Bill Camp's who played as Wilbur Tennant. To sum up, I have to say that \"Dark Waters\" is an amazing movie and I highly recommend everyone to watch it because every person has to be informed by this movie for this scandal. I also believe that \"Dark Waters\" is an equally good movie as \"Spotlight\" of 2015 and \"Deepwater Horizon\" of 2016, which were also movies that presented some other scandals that everybody should be aware of.",

The darkness of the picture adds to the dark mood of the drama.All of the reviews here express outrage over the villainy of the chemical giant, sentiments which demonstrate how effective the movie is, but someone (me) should point out that people are moved by this film because of the superb acting (to be expected from Oscar winners and nominees) and especially the artistry of director Tod Haynes.There are so many gripping scenes which a lesser director would never have thought of - the brief glimpse of the shadowy figure appearing in the parking structure, for example. Haynes and cinematogropher Edward Lachman had used the same color scheme in their 2015 movie, Carol, to the same oppressive effect.

Written by Mario Correa and Matthew Michael CarnahanDark Waters is based on the true story of a lawyer who used to work for corporate defense going after Dupont and their harmful ways. This is a film that takes you into the details, into the minutia and wallows down in the time and the energy it takes to fight corporations like this. Sometimes it takes everything even for someone who understands how the game is played. He used to defend people like Dupont in lawsuits such as the ones depicted in this movie.This movie was directed by Todd Haynes which is highly unusual as this is not the type of movie he makes. This sort of real life courtroom drama is done by more journeyman directors rather than somebody who likes to burrow into the minds of his characters. It's a good thing that he got on board this film as his touch really allows even someone as internal as Mark Ruffalo's character bleed through the screen.This is a story that has been told before. It is very similar to what happened with Erin Brockovich. I understand that this is a true story so naturally it's not trying to copy anything. If you ever want to understand why we need regulations on corporations, stories like what Dupont was doing for decades and the story in Erin Brockovich or the crash of 2008 and many, many,many more stories like that. They can not be relied upon to police themselves. Nobody really can though.This is a heartbreaking story. It was these people's entire way of life not just the cancers they started to get or their livestock dying horribly. The town relied entirely upon Dupont to continue surviving. They sponsor everything. This can make people blind to the evils that they might do. They have more immediate concerns like feeding their family and keeping a roof over their heads. The town even turns against them for doing what they knew in their hearts to be the right thing.The fight though takes decades. It takes a massive toll on Mark Ruffalo's character and his family and even his boss who turns out to be more than a one dimensional character. They wear it on their sleeves.This is a simple and solid film. It hits the points and you come to understand and know who they are and what they're fighting for. It plays things close to the chest and it is a well made but fairly standard movie. I give this one a C.",

It has all the components of a good drama: corruption, deception and manipulation, dedication and sacrifice. This subject is interesting in its own right, especially (as stated in the end of the movie, just before the end credits) it does concern all of us. But, moreover, this film is about one man's obsession. People get hurt and do die. Due to someone's greed and disregard to \"little man\"'s life. Someone ought to be held responsible and be brought to justice one way or another. There are many good people out there to take on such task, but only a handful of those who's willing to stick to it for over a decade. At some expense, I must add - it nearly cost him his career, his marriage and health. It takes a real obsession - you can feel it: he can't just drop it. No matter how hard it is, he keeps on going. And this what made it for me a compelling story.\nMark Ruffalo is great in it. Kind of reminded me of a work he did in two other great movies about men on a mission - Spotlight (2015) and Zodiac (2007). Anne Hathaway has a very few scenes in this movie, but delivers the point being made by this film. I have a soft spot for both Tim Robbins and Bill Pullman. In my opinion, they both were fine in their small parts.\n9/10 for me after the first watch.",

Mark Ruffalo stars as a company attorney who gets a case brought to him by a friend of his grandmother's played by du jour character actor Bill Camp. It turns out Dupont, the chemical concern, bought space on his land to dump waste from their plants as a result of the manufacture of Teflon, a compound most people know is used in nonstick pans but once the run off of this substance gets into the land & water, it can cause birth defects, certain types of cancer & most direly, death. A consummate purveyor of finer details, Ruffalo scrounges for the truth (Dupont at first buries him w/reams of documents hoping to discourage his investigation) uncovering the sobering fact Dupont has known about the effects for years but did nothing about it. Haynes, always a creator of interesting art films, plays it straight here (much like Gus Van Sant did when Good Will Hunting fell into his lap) & comes up w/a decent if altogether standard legal potboiler not unlike something John Grisham may've cooked up in his heyday. Nothing revelatory abounds here w/the supporting performances by Tim Robbins, Anne Hathaway, Victor Garber & Bill Pullman all aces across the board.

            "content": "\"Dark Waters\" is a communal Drama, that delineates a colossal deceit done by a chemical company named 'DuPont' that consequently bears amenability for the people afflicted by an array of emanating adversities. Contemplating lawyer Rob Bilott's contribution in this case; it goes on to showcase how arrant greed and plain ignorance can make lots of innocent people suffer endlessly.I simply adore it when films discuss real world issues. Every so often it needs the medium of entertainment to put through imperative information that must be relayed to us; the general public. It takes bravery, fortitude & an extensive fact-finding to support the claims that are being put forward!Based on a true event that brought on life threatening health complications to a section of people from the state of West Virginia. The story accompanies an engrossing journey of the lawyer Rob Bilott and his relentless pursuit of justice for over a decade.Exquisitely acted by none other than Mark Ruffalo; one of his career best performance indeed. We also become acquainted with Anne Hathaway as his wife Sarah Bilott; unmistakably another notable act from a well acknowledged performer!Aside from exemplary acts & a meritorious base material; the film also shines in its technicalities. Under Todd Haynes's keen supervision, it essays a gloomy, forlorn tonal treatment; aptly conforming with its overall somber & doleful setting.A tristful & nuanced Soundscore grasping upon our conscience right from its inception. Albiet the Screenplay was in need of a more appropriate alacrity, chiefly after the second act commenced. Where it gets a little bit enervated cause of trifling ineptitude that was deep-seated within its writing.Without going into much details about the incidents that took place in the plot; I must say there are some invaluable lessons for us to learn.\nFor instance, how we as commoners could join forces for the greater interest of our society.Inspite of any country you are currently a citizen of, you shouldn't think too little of the magnitude you have within yourself. It's your legal right to protest against such malfeasance, misconducts. Raise your voice, band together & convey the message to the Governments, Corporates and all the Influential People around that we are not to be taken for granted.",

            "content": "Mark Ruffalo stars in a well-written, well-directed, and well-acted legal drama that's a shining example of how corporates treat people (and entire communities) like test-objects to satiate their financial objectives. Director Todd Haynes attributes a turquoise-ish color tone for much of the film, constantly reminding viewers how something as clear as water can slowly kill you from within when tampered with.The film is as much an account of the company in question's diabolical disregard for humanity, as it is Rob Billott's (an excellent Ruffalo). We get a deep-dive into the significant events starting in 1998 that lead to intriguing findings in the subsequent years, with sufficient drama packed in for storytelling purposes. Anne Hathaway, Bill Camp, and Tim Robbins deliver memorable performances. In the latter half of the movie, Rob starts to lose grip over his family life, and his case heads nowhere due to no fault of his. This stretch, while some may shrug off as lagging, was wonderfully portrayed in my opinion.For a legal drama, the courtroom scenes aren't exactly the most striking. What transpires behind the closed doors of meeting rooms and cubicles raises the thrills more often than the prosecution itself. A simple fact-check (on Google) can tell you how much of what's shown in the film is exactly how things went down in that gloomy West Virginian community. Knowing that can only make your heart weep - for yourself and for the world around you!",

            "content": "Dark Waters is a legal thriller film directed by Todd Haynes and written by Mario Correa and Matthew Michael Carnahan, dramatizing Robert Bilott's case against the chemical manufacturing corporation DuPont after they contaminated a town with unregulated chemicals. The writing is excellent and so is the direction, Todd Haynes created a film so brilliant and memorable but yet so hard to watch at times. The film is based on the 2016 New York Times Magazine article \"The Lawyer Who Became DuPont's Worst Nightmare\" by Nathaniel Rich. But the story was first told in the 2007 book \"Stain-Resistant, Nonstick, Waterproof and Lethal: The Hidden Dangers of C8\" by Callie Lyons, a Mid-Ohio Valley journalist who covered the controversy as it was unfolding. It was also reported by other journalists. Robert Bilott also wrote a memoir, Exposure, detailing his 20-year legal battle against DuPont. Mark Ruffalo plays the lead as Robert Bilott, along with Anne Hathaway, Tim Robbins, Bill Camp, Victor Garber, Mare Winningham, William Jackson Harper and Bill Pullman. The cast does a great job but Mark Ruffalo brought yet again a brilliant performance that will me remembered for his entire career.Honestly, the first 30 minutes had me almost quitting because of the extremely slow pacing, but when the case grew deeper and Robert Bilott solved it, I was hooked and was unable to stop watching. The film starts with the Tennant case but it's the legal battle against DuPont and their crimes surrounding Teflon and the dangers of C8 that keeps the film so interesting. But finishing the film left me with various of thoughts and emotions, clearly the cast and crew but especially Todd Haynes and Mark Ruffalo. Now this film is clearly not for everyone but try to watch the entire film, I'm glad I did. It's dialogue heavy with Mark Ruffalo having to deliver a lot of dialogue and he does that fantastically, he was great in the role and as I said, delivered one of his best performances. So why isn't Dark Waters for everyone? The slow pacing is the biggest but I think the story and what it brings up might be too hard for some but my response is how the film raising awareness is only a good thing.",

It's a long movie but it never feels that way thanks to good pacing; outside of that, there is nothing terribly exciting about the directing, score, or the cinematography, which is why I am not giving a higher rating.

First, the true story of Rob Bilott, on which this movie is based on, was just inspiring.The lawyer spent 20 years fighting to hold Dupont to account for dumping hazardous chemicals into the waters in West Virginia. The support from his law firm was encouraging. People/organisations often become more interested in defending what they have (status, success, power) than fighting for what is right. Thus, halfway through the film, I worried that his firm would fire Rob to protect their status or reputation in the field. But apparently, not, and he is still with the same firm.Next, actings were overall great and natural. Not to mention great work by Mark Ruffalo (as Billot), I found Bill Camp (as Tennant) and Tim Robbins (as Terp) excelling in their roles. On a side note, it was to fun to learn that a couple of real characters were in some scenes as cameos.Lastly but not least, this movie stitched different people's lives and struggles together. Apparently, it is a story about the lawyer. But the story of Tennant tugged at my heartstrings equally strong. He was not as well educated as Billot, but his strong will to protect his family and cattle put fire into the long journey to justice.",

His persistence eventually after many years of ducking and weaving by DuPont achieved some success and compensation which tragically was to late for many of the victims.It's a great support cast with Anne Hathaway who plays Rob's wife Sarah and Tim Robbins cast as his boss Tom Turp head partner of the law firm that reluctantly lets Rob take on their largest client.It's a David and Goliath story thankfully these heroes do still fight for justice against Corporate greed often enduring condemnation on both sides of the issue. In this case the everyday townsfolk who's livelihoods are threatened by the very company that is poisoning their environment . Of course we can see this happening today with the coal industry and Climate vandalism destroying our environment.Take a look at this movie the issues portrayed are as relevant today as they were in 1998 when this powerful story begins .",

It works extremely well and they handled the subject matter beyond great.\nI feel like the film has to cram too much in, it's just two hours but after a 100 minutes it felt like they had to wrap everything up quickly, even though they could find another hours worth content.\nMark Ruffalo is great here. He is a great actor especially when he isn't Bruce Banner. He makes this film and it's definitely his greatest role since Zodiac.\nEveryone else is really good as well and it's great to see Tim Robbins again.\nOverall I do have some minor flaws here and there but nothing majorly wrong.

Marcelo Zarvos also doesn't seem like a very good composer, the score for wonder was just as uninspired and bland as the music in dark waters.None of the acting was bad. Mark Ruffalo was great casting as Rob Bilott is a role practically made for him to play. He still wasn't great though, in my opinion the last great Ruffalo performance was in eternal sunshine of the spotless mind, and that performance still isn't amazing.I've already touched on my main issue with this film briefly, the presentation. Dark waters is presented in a really uninteresting way, this caused an abundance of boring conversation scenes that became very representative. I don't have a problem with dialogue driven films at all, (just look at my ratings) but the presentation of these conversations was so boring I didn't want to know what was actually being said.I think you should watch this if you're not aware of the events that dark waters is inspired by as they are interesting.

What we discover is what Bilott did and in the sequence of how it was learned. Mark Ruffalo, playing the main character, did a splendid job conveying both his caring and his devotion for the little guy, despite being a corporate law attorney. The timeline was easy to follow and follow one does; you can't walk away from the screen. It was good movie and made my top ten list for 2019 motion pictures.It was an education as well; after it was over I was compelled to look up the chemical PFOA, one few people knew about before Bilott's diligence, not even the EPA. That agency as well as two other federal agencies dropped the ball after being put on notice by Bilott of the danger to the public health. Of course, he won the case few if any would have and we sort of expected that given the movie genre and the examples cited at the beginning here.Now I'll refer to the movie's epilogue stated facts; those are plastered while the movie credits scroll. Bilott won his first three court decisions against the giant Dupont company, for $1.6Million, the second for $5.6M and the third for $12.5M before the class action he championed was decided in the amount of $670.7Million for 3,535 remaining individuals. PFOA is now believed to be present in virtually every creatures' blood on the planet and certainly 99% of humans.PFOA (perfluorooctanoic acid) is what's called a forever chemical, you can't rid yourself of its accumulation. It's one of 600 identified such chemicals, toxic in as low as 70ppt (parts per trillion) and most all are unregulated because government health monitoring and regulating agencies can't keep up with the chemical companies.The movie hits us hard, it must make all of us ponder and it should motivate us all to take these matters seriously and to elect politicians who are not owing to the corporations because like the Dupont company was painted in this movie have the system rigged. I will not forget this movie any time soon, nor will you.",

            "review_title": "A Good Important Film",
            "content": "So this film came out earlier this year, but never came to the cinema near me and then we got to the pandemic so I never got the chance to watch Dark Waters, but the film has just made its way to Amazon Prime and I watched it last night and here is my review for it. The premise of the film sees a corporate defence attorney take on an environmental lawsuit against a chemical company that exposes a history of pollution.Main Character\nMark Ruffalo plays the main character here and he does a great job here, the man is just a great actor and he shows it in this film. You do care about his character and you are behind him the entire way, he just conveys a movie star and he makes the story feel really large stakes and that is mainly due to a really quality lead performance here.Supporting Characters\nThis has a really great supporting cast in it, Anne Hathaway plays his wife in the film and she is good. I mean there are times when I feel like she is underutilised but when she is on screen she has strong scenes and I thought the relationship was well presented here. Tim Robbins plays his boss and he is really good, they have a good working relationship in the film and there is one scene in particular where he goes off and gives a really great dramatic scene. Bill Camp is the one who hires Ruffalo and he gives a strong performance, you can tell just how much the whole thing affects him and how frustrated he is by the whole situation. You really feel for him and want to see him do okay and you just want Ruffalo to help him out. Victor Garber & Bill Pullman are great in their smaller roles, especially Pullman who steals the show in his 5 minutes and provides some great moments.Story\nThe story is based on true events, though I'm sure the odd bits have been added for glamour but it feels like a story that needed to be told as I like a lot of people didn't know about this story before this film. The film does a great job in showing just how serious this whole situation was and how hard Ruffalo's character worked to expose the chemical industry and raise this very serious situation. However, I would say that this film struggled in terms of how it told its story, the film takes place over 13 years but it doesn't do a great job of showing that. In a few minutes years pass in the film but the characters seem to be in the same space and doing the same thing and it struggles to keep you invested especially in the latter halves of the film, also the end of the film introduces a new part of the story and then just ends, I felt like it would have been way more interesting but you never see it. It feels like to get this whole story told, this should have been a longer film or even a mini series to document the whole story.Script\nThe script is fine, there are some really good dramatic scenes in this film that make you care and make you realise the talent that is on show here. But there aren't really any humanising scenes here, and what I mean is that every scene is so dramatic that it feels a bit too much at times and makes these people not seem real even though the whole situation is very real. Also as I mentioned above, I don't feel the script was written particularly well in terms of the way it conveys the story and the plot.Style\nThe style of the film is very heavy and does a really good job in showcasing the horrors that are going on in this film and make you buy into the situation and fully support our protagonist. The film is interesting, but it also feels like important parts of the plot are glossed over, because they have to in order to keep the runtime down and it does hurt the pacing making it feel a slower pace which hurts the film.Overall\nOverall, this is a good film with an important story and filled with great performances. If you are a fan of gritty, real films with important stories then this could be a film for you.Rating - 7/10.",

Director also finds suspense in things where there shouldn't be suspense. The film, in general, gets audiences riled up, but it never makes one care enough to feel moved to action. On the other hand, Ruffalo skillfully portrays real life lawyer as a caring man who internalizes his feelings, there are no dramatic outbursts or polemical speeches while film features very good supporting cast that provide some solid performances that helps build and keep the tension throughout the film. For me, the only real let-down is Anne Hathaway. Also, the runtime is a little long (126 min). At the end, while the pace of the film might be laborious for some, movie is gripping indictment of corporate greed in modern America and if you have Teflon in your kitchen, it may well make you nervous too.Rating: 8-/7+",

One scene shows a street, and some cars, and lingers there, like there's something there we should see. What is it? No clue.\nThese kinds of movies are sort of review-proof. The story is so worthy of a movie, and is enough by itself to make anyone angry. This movie just wastes the chance. In the last few minutes the film gives some statements about the devastating and longlasting effects of this \"forever chemical.\" Those crushing statistics alone have about 100x as much impact as does this entire slog of a movie.\nIf you want to learn about this horrible corporate crime, I recommend you read about it online rather than sit through this pathetic rendering.

But, geez, it was quite a dull ride.Sure, a film such as Erin Brockovich is sensationalist - a bit cheesy, but it was a hoot to watch, and I am still referring to it 20 years on. I bet, five years from now, when faced with someone else's Teflon pan and the evil legacy of the coating - the subject of Dark waters - I will be squinting and frowning, trying to recall even the name of this film.Take The big short as another example. It also told a real-life tale, also honoured the victims and pointed out the guilty, and dealt with very serious subject matter to boot. It was a thrill ride from beginning to end, with larger-than-life characters and quirky interviews. It also broke down very complex information into totally understandable bits of information.The miniseries Chernobyl was slow-paced and rather heavy, but riveting to watch, even though you knew what the outcome would be. You still hoped it wouldn't be so. In other words, you can go various routes when telling a real-life tale: you can be funny, you can be serious, you can be quirky, if you are entertaining.Perhaps this is not director Todd Haynes's forte, the real-life tale told in a straightforward manner. The man has quite the Rotten Tomatoes CV. In between Far from heaven (2003) and Certain women (2016), there are quite a few fresh tomatoes thrown in. Let's face it, the fact that he did not win an Oscar for Carol was an affront to mankind. I cannot quite explain what went wrong with Dark waters. I mean, even Mark Ruffalo was rather bland in this. And when was Anne Hathaway relegated to playing a teeny-weeny part as the boring wife? The only interesting character was Bill Camp as Wilbur Tennant, and he doesn't feature a hell of a lot.It is a fascinating story of corporate greed and environmental disaster.

His wife Sarah Barlage Bilott (Anne Hathaway) is trying to keep him away from going out because it is tearing him away from the family.Dark Waters was a movie I really wanted to see when it was in theaters in 2019. It sucks that I couldn't see it in the cinema. I saw it on DVD in 2020 and I was as impressed as I thought I would be. I enjoyed this film. It was funny and like the title says, scary. It wasn't like a bunch of jump scare, but it was a true story that scares you because it is real! I loved that about this film. There was only one thing I didn't like. That was the titles. When they would say the date and what was going on. I thought they just looked weird and they made it feel like you weren't really going where they wanted you to go. I just thought that it was a weird choice. That was the only thing I didn't like.The acting was outstanding. Mark Ruffalo gives one of his best performances to date. I haven't seen a bunch of his movies, but I think this performance will certainly be up on the list of some of his best. Anne Hathaway also surprisingly did a great job. She wasn't in the movie a whole lot, but when she was, she delivered. You could tell she had to do sort of an accent for this film too. Tim Robbins did good. He wasn't in the movie a whole lot. After Shawshank Redemption he hasn't really done much. Bill Pullman did basically nothing. He was barely in the movie. Everyone in the film performed their roles to the best of their ability.The story was fantastic. Like I said earlier, it would scare you because of the fact it was a true story. They did a great job of that. The way it made the chemical company feel was also fantastic. It made them seem like a big evil cooperation that wouldn't stop so they would get there money. They did great with that. I must say the lighting was fantastic also. Whenever you went to the town that was being effected it would always be dark and gloomy. They did a great job of the letting you now that something wrong was going on there.Overall, Dark Waters was a film that is defiantly worth a watch for anybody.",

Dark Waters is what I would call an \"article film\" ie a film which reads out like an article like we saw in Spotlight and Hustlers.While the direction, performances, score, editing and cinematography all being good but nothing extraordinary the reason why this film stick out mainly is because it explains the content in such a manner that even a 3 year old would understand it and that too without engaging in spoon feeding. The drawbacks are that Anne Hathaway and Tim Robbins don't have a very big role and at times the dialogue feels bland.On the whole don't miss out on this film, it deals with an important subject that affects every living being in this planet but something we don't notice. The corporate-political nexus has been exposed to us many times but Dark Waters exposes the Corporate-Academia nexus. The last movie I saw in cinemas before lockdown, now eagerly waiting for Tenet.",

But this film is neither entertaining nor interesting. It's boring. It's not a good film.Perhaps the biggest issue is Mark Ruffalo's complete lack of charisma. I appreciate that it's an important issue for him and he produced it, but he couldn't carry the movie with screen presence. Add in Anne Hathaway, one of the worst actresses around who should never be cast in anything, and you have a recipe for a bad film.Given how much I care about the issues involved, it's sad that the film didn't manage to reach any emotional resonance with me. I didn't care about any of the characters, except perhaps Wilbur, but he was barely in it after first part.Overall, I would advise people to just read the New York Times article it was based on, instead of watching this. It's called: The Lawyer Who Became DuPont's Worst Nightmare",

            "content": "One thing the lockdown has shown us is that there are two sets of rules for people. One for affluent, the one perched atop the highest branch and the other for those scrawling at the lowest branch or doodling on the ground. The one close to the ruling party will get just a friendly slap on the wrist while the brunt of the long arm of the law would descend upon the nobody.An 80-year-old vagabond who was waiting for his free food was slapped with a RM1000/= compound without much deliberation. He risks imprisonment. A minister was seen sharing meals with his supporters, and a deputy minister was enjoying his birthday bash without a care in the world of the MCO. The prowling digital spies did manage to capture the moment for the public to judge, but the law seems to be dragging its feet. This type of subservience by the authorities to the people of power is no alien to this country alone.Beware, there is a 2015 horror flick named 'Dark Water' (singular) which is different from the remake of Japanese movie with almost the same name.This 2019 film is based on real events. It tells the story of the fight of a lone farmer, Wilbur Tennant, who took legal suits against DuPont, a giant chemical company. It started in 1995 when the farmer discovered that his cattle, 190 of them, had died mysteriously with bloated organs and blackened teeth. He suspected that the cause could be due to the dumping of chemicals upstream. He tried to get the help of the authorities, but instead, he was slapped with a fine for improper farming.Living in dire circumstances, he approached an old friends' grandson, Robert Billot, a hotshot lawyer who makes his fortune defending multinational chemical companies. Initially, reluctant to waste his time on an unrewarding case, he finally caved in to investigate the farmer's complaint.He became interested when the environmental impact assessment report showed no contaminants, but DuPont's internal investigations repeatedly showed some unknown abbreviated compound. He also noticed that many dwellers of the town had an unusually high incidence of cancers. Everyone in the town looked at Tennant and Billot as trouble makers as DuPont had contributed so much in the upliftment and upkeep of that town, Parkersburg, West Virginia. Things had really changed for the better since DuPont set up a plant there. They thought their misery was a small price to pay for development.Using the tentacles of the law to his advantage, Billot came to discover that compound was indeed PFOA, a fluorated hydrocarbon, which was used to make Teflon coating in non-stick pans.It came to light that PFOA or C8 and PFOS had poisoned the land and their drinking water. Now, everybody wanted to join in the suit against the giant. It indeed became a David versus Goliath match. The mega-company used all the might of their finances to quash dissidence. Lawsuits were not affordable for the average Joe. Neither the legal fraternity nor the administrative bodies are laypeople friendly. Just like how flies are drawn to garbage, power begets influence.At the end of the day, the general public is left only with a loud public voice via civil society bodies, the fourth estate and an unbiased judiciary system.But wait, is the legal system here to carry out the law or to mete out justice?In real life, Robert Bilott went through many financial and familial turmoils pursuing the matter, for each and every defendant, 3,500 of them. After a long battle that spanned ten-over years (Tennant had died then), he won the first three multimillion-dollar settlements against DuPont, and DuPont settled the class action for $671 million. Du Pont, however, seems unperturbed. They are still going on business as usual with other joint ventures.For our own knowledge, Teflon is marketed as other variants and have made their way to our household in various forms - water-resistant furniture and carpets, wrinkle-free and water-repellant clothing, lubricants, pizza boxes, dental floss and many more.",

This sounds like a lot, but given they were earning over a billion dollars per year from Teflon sales, this is 2/3 of one years profits, and they were doing this for over 60 years.I never understand why so many people believe de-regulation is a good thing. Every single case of de-regulation has shown that companies will put profit before morality (surprise surprise), whether it is tobacco, petroleum, pharmaceutical, energy (Texas' power grid, anyone?), banking and finance or anything else. The argument for de-regulation is basically that we should trust corporations to put the common good before corporate profits, which any sane person will tell you is lunacy.This is why this kind of story needs to be told - the world deserves better.",

Most corporations will try to cover up and minimize the losses. Some worse than others but it's not as rampant as people would have you believe. When it happens it is usually awful and most time the company behaves poorly after the fact as well as before. I just don't usually care to watch a fictional movie about it. I'd rathers see the actual documentary for this kinda thing. Fictional movies, based on a true story or not are trying to get across a message, trigger your emotions and entertain you not bore you. Most real life incidents are way more boring than the movie. But really a 7.6 not for me.

You can feel throughout the film that this is a project that is specifically made through passion, and not to sell, and that's what makes it feel so real.\nThe acting throughout is impeccable, and it engulfs you into the story like only the top 30% of films do. Loved Marks performance, and the Farmer felt real as well.\nCinematography was also pretty good, with some great shots that will soon be classics I believe. And that is most likely due to the combination of work from set designers, making it feel like the real place.There are only a couple hiccup that I feel this film had. one was in the one helicopter scene during the mid section of the film. It wasn't that it was a bad scene, it just didn't fit in the rest of the film and I feel cutting it out entirely would have made the mid to end point of the film have slightly better pacing.The second one, I'd say, is how Rob Billot explains everything about the situation. The scale of the things only set in place when he explains them to his wife, however, the way this is edited and scripted makes it feel more like a mash up, or a cop out by the script writer and director to develop all these story points faster. I feel like adding slight clues throughout the film, and showing them with visuals rather than audio would have made a way better film.\nI do understand that this might be due to time constraints, and therefore for the first time, I feel like a film (this film) should have been made into a series, as a lot of the points made throughout need more explanation.Overall this is an decently good film, about a tough topic, however some issues make it feel dull at pointsI definitely recommend you watch this film, but if you don't, you're not missing out on much, as a couple 10 minute YouTube videos can explain the situation better.",

It is a very poorly told film, terribly flat, without any rhythm or climatic moments, it could have been a good thriller, but Haynes instead decided on a very long (126 min.) and boring melodrama. It is also, very unprofessional, that the director cheatfully tries to trick us with a false tension, during the scenes of the parking lot, trying to give some life to his dying film.\nThe crooked frames are chaotic and unjustified. There is no direction of actors, throughout the movie we see a totally expressionless Ruffalo and a wasted Hathaway. Natural themes such as \"the greed and insensitivity of corporations\" could be the \"leitmotif\" of the film, instead they were replaced by banal events of work and daily life, so that it too, little by little went getting polluted until it succumbed.\nCast includes: Mark Ruffalo, Anne Hathaway, Tim Robbins, Bill Pullman",

Instead we are swept up in a second rate, predictable drama, with very little to discuss at the end except for the poor acting performances, boring editing and anaemic script.Due to the subject at hand - DuPont's gross negligence and mass poisoning - many on here recommend this movie as vital viewing. Rubbish. Save yourself the time and read an article about it instead.",

Anne Hathaway, Tim Robbins and Bill Pullman supply the very credible support, in gritty but relatively minor roles for their reputations.Director Todd Haynes is a dab hand at creating a picture with stunning visual credentials and Dark Waters is no different. The beautiful cold blues and yellow tones applied to the lens filter provide a real murky atmosphere in fitting with the story. Dark Waters leaves no stone unturned in its attention to detail with the plot, as paperwork after paperwork archives are sifted through and more and more evidence emerges in the quest for the truth. This prolonging of thread lines actually proves somewhat of a negative aspect of the film in certain regards as things burn far too slowly in places. The apparent lack of a prominent sound score is also amiss, with a feel of intensity and urgency lacking from the piece as a whole. As a powerful drama based on such profoundly shocking occurrence this production is highly credible. The movie cannot be faulted for its gloriously bleak visuals and flawless character portrayals. Whether or not the movies duration could've been shortened to its advantage is a question worth pondering. The spectacle does tend to drag at times leaving an overall sense of disappointment that Haynes' stunning visual account isn't quite as impactful as the severity of the scandal.",

One quick note, I know Ruffalo was in spotlight, a somewhat similarly themed docu-movie, around the same time. Cinematically, this is not on the same tier as spotlight. It is not as long, the cast is not as strong beyond Robbins, Hathaway and Ruffalo, and at times its just not as good.

The only scientific claim that can be made about the safety of Teflon is that it deteriorates into possibly harmful chemicals at cooking temperatures close to 260 degree centigrade, which is almost never reached during ordinary cooking. The actual EPA investigation that happened was on perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA, or C8), which was once used as a surfactant in the manufacture of Teflon, although most manufacturers have phased out its use. This movie does a good job of generating chemophobia and fear of big corporations. The other aspects of the movie are hardly worth praising and the performances of actors are often lackluster.",

We need more people like Rob!As for the filmmaking itself, the movie is slow paced with a rough around the edges feel - hard to tell if it was the projection at my cinema or the cinematography itself but there was a few naff flares in the darker scenes which where off putting. It does have an independent look and feel rather than a polished Hollywood film. Some questionable editing in parts.Mark Ruffalo gives his usual performance. I was really surprised to see Anna Hathaway play such a tiny roll - but she was spectacular especially in the more tense/emotional scenes.I'll be telling everyone to watch this movie. I'd probably only watch it again myself if I was with someone who hadn't. The story drives the film - I suppose if you read about it it would be equally shocking - the film doesn't add much to it.",

His use of facial expressions says so much about his character here, along with the rest of his take on the actual attorney Rob Billott. Robbins and especially Hathaway give strong support as Billott's boss and wife, respectively.\nAnd you can try to bury him under a farmer's cap, sasquatch eyebrows, and some sort of rural accent, but I know Bill Camp. He's great again here, as usual. \nThis is fairly rote stuff, direction and story-wise, with the obligatory final case results on the screen before the closing credits, but Todd Haynes still did a solid job with tone, the use of dark, muted lighting to give a feel of ominous, impending gloom, and the parts of the story he chose to use both in Billott's working of the case and its effects on his family.\nVery good movie, Haynes. 3.6 stars",

The film dramatizes Robert Bilott's (Mark Ruffalo) 20-year legal battle against the chemical company, DuPont. Unlike Travolta's character in A Civil Action \u2014 a film with a similar, more isolated plot \u2014 Robert is far from a Class Action/Tort litigator. In fact, when we meet Robert, he defends chemical companies at a fancy Cincinnati-based law firm. It's not until a cantankerous farmer (Bill Camp) shows up at his office (all the way from W.Va) that Robert tugs on a thread that will reshape his family life, career, and morals. At first, the movie does seem like a 2019 version of A Civil Action \u2014 poor, rural town whose water is poisoned \u2014 but quickly expands far beyond anything I had imagined. Moreover, the story arc is, well, not an arc at all, but a roller-coaster peak and trough excursion of wins and losses. Tim Robbins plays the gray-haired managing partner and delivers head-nodding pro-lawyer, pro-human speech. The ending is satisfying, but maybe not satisfying enough for what the company has done to each and every one of us.",

To the degree that this movie is accurate to actual events, that statement applies.\n\nTo be sure, this is not the type of movie that people who do not like a methodical, thinking story, instead preferring mindless popcorn action. The movie slowly builds the case against DuPont. The pacing is excellent for a story that spans two decades. I also loved how moody and atmospheric the setting is: I don't think the sun ever shines on West Virginia!

So many films over the years have fallen into the trap of sacrificing one element for another and ultimately coming up weaker for it. The draw of Dark Waters lies in its realistic structure: a long, excruciating, slow-burning struggle that leaves the audience at best mildly infuriated and at worst steaming. This procedural, expansive take might also be its greatest weakness as well as strength, due to some repetition and dullness over the 2+ hours.\n\nRuffalo and Hathaway are absolutely Hollywood A-listers, although Hathaway doesn't actually do much here. She is undoubtedly only second behind Ruffalo in having the most lines in the film, but the action is driven forwards by Ruffalo with Hathaway firmly in a supporting role with a few scenes to step up and take control. Her style might be over-the-top for some, and there are occasions where she becomes larger than life in typical, scene-stealing Hathaway fashion. Ruffalo himself does quite well in a fairly understated role with fleeting moments to shine. I thought that Bill Camp was brilliant in a smaller role as a farmer who loses everything as a result of a frankly evil chemical corporation.\n\nOn the subject of the corporation and the film's themes, I thought that the film managed to layer the conflict really well without oversimplifying in too many places. We also receive a rare humanization of lawyers who typically represent corporations. Rob's character begins the film as one, but experiences an awakening upon the realisation that such despicable actions have been committed by DuPont. The varying degrees of support that Rob receives from the legal camp also humanizes his fellow lawyers, striking against the Man vs. World trope so often seen while also having the \"right\" side remain the underdog. We have a straightforward social issue film without too many bells and whistles and a purpose easy to get behind.",

This movie will make you feel for the characters, be glad they did what they did, and acknowledge their sacrifice to do the right thing.  I was waiting for someone to take the low road and cop out, it made me believe there can be justice served, although DuPont should have suffered more.    I would highly recommend this movie.",

No matter what their CEOs say (lies), they only care about money and how they can profit from their businesses.

With his eighth feature, director Todd Haynes has crafted an authentic account of the legal case against the DuPont corporation. It's the filmmaker's first attempt to dramatize Robert Bilott's case against the chemical corporation, but he pulls it off seamlessly. Using captivating cinematography, Haynes draws viewers in the life of an obsessive lawyer. From intimate close-ups to tense tracking shots, the cinematography keeps viewers immersed in the film's setting. It gives the film a dark and gloomy atmosphere that is reminiscent of legal thrillers from the 1990's. It is hard to not praise the powerful performances from the cast. Mark Ruffalo delivers one of the best performances of his career as Robert Bilott. With riveting expressions, he conveys the dedication, tenacity and righteous fury of the real-life lawyer. The supporting cast, which includes the esteemed Tim Robbins, is also worthy of recognition. Although \"Dark Waters\" is undeniably unforgettable, ultimately it is not a flawless film. At over two hours, it is slightly long and suffers from a lengthy running-time. Moreover, the film builds to the formulaic conclusion that is typical of films in the genre. Nevertheless, fans of legal thrillers will definitely enjoy \"Dark Waters\" and so will movie-goers seeking engrossing entertainment. At a time when modern audiences have never heard of the DuPont legal case, it's a stirring reminder that the stories of heroic whistleblowers are worth retelling on the big-screen.",

            "content": "This is the Rotten Tomatoes consensus on Dark waters: \"Dark waters powerfully relays a real-life tale of infuriating malfeasance, honouring the victims and laying blame squarely at the feet of the perpetrators.\" Sure, it is an incredible real-life tale; it does honour the countless victims and does blame the horribly guilty parties. But, geez, it was quite a dull ride.\n\nSure, a film such as Erin Brockovich is sensationalist \u2013 a bit cheesy, but it was a hoot to watch, and I am still referring to it 20 years on. I bet, five years from now, when faced with someone else's Teflon pan and the evil legacy of the coating \u2013 the subject of Dark waters \u2013 I will be squinting and frowning, trying to recall even the name of this film.\n\nTake The big short as another example. It also told a real-life tale, also honoured the victims and pointed out the guilty, and dealt with very serious subject matter to boot. It was a thrill ride from beginning to end, with larger-than-life characters and quirky interviews. It also broke down very complex information into totally understandable bits of information.\n\nThe miniseries Chernobyl was slow-paced and rather heavy, but riveting to watch, even though you knew what the outcome would be. You still hoped it wouldn't be so. In other words, you can go various routes when telling a real-life tale: you can be funny, you can be serious, you can be quirky, if you are entertaining.\n\nPerhaps this is not director Todd Haynes's forte, the real-life tale told in a straightforward manner. The man has quite the Rotten Tomatoes CV. In between Far from heaven (2003) and Certain women (2016), there are quite a few fresh tomatoes thrown in. Let's face it, the fact that he did not win an Oscar for Carol was an affront to mankind. I cannot quite explain what went wrong with Dark waters. I mean, even Mark Ruffalo was rather bland in this. And when was Anne Hathaway relegated to playing a teeny-weeny part as the boring wife? The only interesting character was Bill Camp as Wilbur Tennant, and he doesn't feature a hell of a lot.\n\nIt is a fascinating story of corporate greed and environmental disaster. I did not feel the outrage.",

            "content": "Dark Waters is a meticulously crafted film that is both very important and very entertaining. It digs deep into the disgraceful actions of large corporations with a very sharp scalpel. Mark Ruffalo is superb as Robert Billot, a corporate lawyer who ends up dedicating his life to fighting for the 'little person'. In this case it's against the horrendous practices of the Dupont company, one of the largest chemical companies in the world. After a farmer discovers his herd of cows are all dying after drinking from the local river, it leads to finding that many people in his small West Virginia town have developed and died from cancer through a contaminated water supply. Through lengthy and painstaking research Billot uncovers the dark secrets of Dupont. A chemical created (PFOA) for the making of Teflon is actually a direct cause of cancer and it was dumped directly into the environment. The film is a true legal thriller as we see Billot go head to head in court to win damages for his clients in a large class action suit. Director Todd Haynes has made many different films in his storied career and he tackles this genre with great skill. He is aided by a terrific cast that also includes Tim Robbins, Bill Camp and Anne Hathaway. The film has a very grey palate that suits the seriousness of the subject. But this film is no chore, its vital importance is thankfully matched by a snappy pace and a vital heart.",

I find stories like this to be very compelling, not only from revealing the depths to which corporate greed can run, irregardless of public safety, but also of the lengths to which a single man can go to in order to reveal it.  You probably won't like learning that we're all walking around full of the kinds of chemicals that Dupont willfully poisoned people with, but it's educational nonetheless.  My only possible qualm with the movie is that the ending felt a bit unsatisfying, but considering the subject matter, perhaps that is life!",

The director has chosen to make this a solid, straightforward piece of storytelling rather than trying to be smart or showy. And this is just right for this story.

Without giving away any specific details, I'm going to say this, I'm extremely disappointed in our governments lack of care when it comes to manufacturers polluting our streams, rivers and lands.  As long as DuPont can make a donation to a senator or congressman, EPA officials, whoever they need to turn their heads, and those people do turn their heads and listens with deaf ears, we are in disparate trouble.  I was shocked to discover the decades and years of proof that our our government elected officials chose to ignore.  All at the cost of losing lives, loved ones losing children, parents, siblings, friends, anyone who loved the person who died.  Not to mention, the deformed newborns.  This Attorney's fight is not over.  With every new year, new DuPont Attorneys and new CEO's try to change the rules, only caring about their shareholders growth and the board of directors thinking only with billions of dollars in their brains.  It makes me sick.  Shamed on anyone who partook in this fiasco!!  Why are laws so flexible to those with huge amounts of money?  These corporations should be held responsible for not only their knowledge of hiding such lethal chemical knowledge, as they willfully continue to manufacture a lethal product and plaintiffs continue to sue for damages, try should also be fined where it counts and where it hurts the very most.  They should be forced to shut down all operations of their daily  billion dollar money maker ( I \"think\" they said a DAY), the Teflon production line.  Shut it down for however long it takes for them to create an eco friendly/Green version of a non stick surface.  Not allowing the production to return until they've properly destroyed all HAZMAT chemicals, properly cleaned the city, lakes, streams, water systems, and their factory machines and floors.  When a manufacturer Is allowed and subsequently allowed to murder people, murder pets and wildlife, murder farm animals being raised to put on our plates at home, make deform babies within a pregnant woman's womb, THERE IS SOMETHING SERIOUSLY WRONG WITH OUR SYSTEM ANDOUR GOVERNMENT.  After watching this movie, if you are not shocked,  heartbroken and lastly. angry at DuPont, you could be a narcissist, much like our government robots who sell themselves to the highest bidder without a care who they are allowing to be harmed.  This is a must see movie for anyone still passionate about justice and liberty for all.  2000's Corporate America today and in the future.  The longer they''re still able to conduct business,  the more ruthless they become.  No one can touch them.  Sound familiar?!?!  Exactly! Get the \u2018hoes for dollas' out of office.

Dark Waters is a fair legal thriller film focusing on the story about Robert Bilott (Mark Ruffalo) and his discovery about DuPont and their chemical factories that is affecting the water supply and appliances that is toxic to a persons health. The plot was informative about the events that took place. It is kind of scary cause the appliances and stuff that everyone uses is involved. And can put a person at risk for cancer or some health related issue. Performances by Mark Ruffalo and Anne Hathaway was good. I did find the film to have a slow moving direction and dragged in the middle of the movie. Overall, Dark Waters is an okay film with a thought provoking plot and performances. But boring direction.",

            "content": "One of the most shocking films you'll ever watch.\n\nTodd Haynes' legal thriller Dark Waters (2019) is a masterpiece of impeccable direction telling a fascinating true story in harrowing detail with a riveting lead performance from Mark Ruffalo. I'm so glad I gave Dark Waters a chance. I thought it would be a generic legal drama, but it's impeccably directed and well researched with harrowing information. Dark Waters is for fans of Zodiac, Spotlight, Erin Brockovich, All the President's Men, Contagion, and Chernobyl. I am confident it will enrage, shock, and sicken you. Corporations are evil and get away with murder; never forget that.\n\nTodd Haynes is a director to watch after Carol and Dark Waters, he has established himself as a stylish auteur of classy resolve and striking vision. I can say that Darks Waters blew me away and I expected very little from this legal thriller. But Haynes provides endless information, compelling evidence, steadfast direction, and uncompromising vision for this brave story. Dark Waters will hopefully let audiences become aware of Dupont's criminal negligence in poisoning the world with their C-8 chemicals in toxic dumps to kitchen pans. I really hope that people will acknowledge the heroic and tireless work of lawyer Robert Bilott. \n\nMatthew Michael Carnahan and Mario Correa's script is mature and full of interesting takes on legal jargon used to defend corporate interests. They are very sympathetic to the affected communities with their humanistic writing. Affonso Gon\u00e7alves' editing is very smooth and keeps you in the moment as he cleverly transitions by year with neat little scenes. I appreciate how he just lets scenes breathe for a moment before cutting to the next relative sequence of events. I really liked Marcelo Zarvos' score. It's beautifully haunting and fits the dark subject matter aptly.\n\nMark Ruffalo has really come into his own with these niche political, crime, and legal thrillers like Zodiac, Spotlight, and Dark Waters. He's very subtle and nuanced here as Robert Bilott. The horror of what Bilott is finding out dawns on his face in revealing close-ups. Edward Lachman's sleek cinematography really makes Ruffalo look isolated and alone in his fight against Dupont. Anne Hathaway returns to serious dramatic acting for the first time since Brokeback Mountain and she's really moving here in Dark Waters as Ruffalo's long suffering wife Sarah Bilott.\n\nTim Robbins is wonderful as the harsh and blunt law firm head and boss to Ruffalo named Tom Terp. He advocates for justice and good lawyering in an intriguing role for sure. Bill Camp is phenomenal with a thick accent and heavy empathy for the poor farmer Wilbur Tennant. He carries scenes with an unusually notably gravitas. Bill Pullman is likable as the passionate class action lawsuit lawyer Harry Dietzler. I should mention the excellent performance from Victor Garber as Dupont's law representative.\n\nIn short, Dark Waters is so engaging due to Haynes' magical direction alongside its numerous fascinating character performances. Lastly, I just want to say it was very sweet of Todd Haynes to include cute hidden cameos from the real people involved in this unreal story.",

As thrillers go, it isn't particularly thrilling, and I kept waiting for it to hit a stride and lead to an anticipated crescendo, but we never get there, we just sort of slog along with the legal turmoil these people suffered and only get some small solace in the final moments of the film.

It's not a typical Todd Haynes movie, and I'm still wondering why it seemed to have caught so few people's attention. It was a similar story to that of Erin Brockovich, but instead of a busty, ballsy woman, the protagonist is a schlubby lawyer who is just trying to do the right thing. I also wonder if people are so inured by the awfulness of the world, with every day bringing a new horror, that the true story of DuPont purposefully poisoning citizens in West Virginia just can't find room to get on people's radar. I wonder if we are so inured to the depravity of corporations in their search of profit, that this story doesn't resonate more widely. I'd definitely recommend catching it on streaming.",

A lot of these modern true stories end up feeling so similar, and it gets kind of boring watching one, but I feel like Dark Waters adds its own spin on things. Also, while I know it isn't intentional on the movie's part, it made me even more concerned when the movie ended without a true solution.

One usually gets the standard film where the drama in the court room takes center stage and as the mountain of evidence is revealed the film usually shows it off in dramatic fashion. That is NOT the case with Dark Waters; rest assured that it's a good thing it doesn't do any of that.\nStarring Mark Ruffalo and Anne Hathaway, Dark Waters tells the true story of how one corporate defense attorney sought to bring the truth to light to this country of how the DuPont corporation had been knowingly poisoning the water system in West Virginia for decades while lying to the EPA about its chemicals. Ruffalo's character, Robert Bilott, risks his entire career, his family and even his very life to try bring the truth out to everyone. Dark Waters is carried by fine acting performances by Ruffalo and Anne Hathaway, who plays as Bilott's wife, Sarah Bilott. Together they successfully exemplify the drama of the family dynamics as the court case begins to affect everyone involved. What makes this film a very good film is that it focuses on Bilott's journey to uncover the truth while also making this a very human story, not just about the Bilott's but of the affected community as well. It could have focused only on the evidence how it was uncovered but by choosing to go the other route instead, this movie turns into a more intriguing eco-thriller well worth the time to go see in theatres. Incredibly, it's a true story that is actually still ongoing, although the film does have a good ending.",

The true story of a chemical company essentially poisoning an entire town, and then engineering the cover up is a project that deserves attention. Unfortunately, for it's audiences it's a very hard watch with little reward for the task.\n\nMark Ruffalo plays environmental attorney, Robert Bilott, someone who works for a firm that is used to defending chemical companies instead of prosecuting them. His life is turned upside down when a farmer from a West Virginia town comes to him for help regarding a chemical company he suspects is behind the bizarre death of the animals on his farm. As Bilott digs further he uncovers evidence that stretches back decades and provokes the wrath of corporation worth billions that will do what it has to in order to protect their operation.\n\nThe problem here is director, Todd Haynes, sticks us into a gloomy box of a world for over 2 hours. There is no humor. There are no points to feel anything but pain along the course of the film. We want to root for Bilott but we're pushed into his misery as he seeks out justice. The only excitement we're getting is through the numerous hearings regarding the case and shuffling of attorney files.\n\nRuffalo is good and is getting some deserved award buzz, but the best moments belong to Anne Hathaway as his struggling wife, and Tim Robbins as his tough but sympathetic boss. In fact, without those two, the film can't pick up a pace faster than a painful crawl.\n\n\"Dark Waters\" is not a bad film. And there are some strong dramatic moments, but it's such a heavy lift of a watch, I suspect many of us will take the quietly satisfying feeling we get at the end of the story and never look back.",

I feel like a lot of the scenes are literally copied and pasted from other films of a quirky, small-town lawyer guy fighting for the little guy, so I guess I didn't walk away completely in awe or even feeling like it stood out.

He gets approached in his office by a small-town farmer from West Virginia (Bill Camp) who is convinced that a big-time chemical company is poisoning the water near his property.  If Bilott decides to take this case on, how many shady practices will be uncovered?  Now it really was the positive word of mouth that got me into the theater.  Dark Waters has been getting mostly lofty reviews, and with an actor with street cred like Mark Ruffalo, I figured that I didn't have anything to lose.  I think that this is a really solid film, and it is a story that needs to be told.  Now I did not really know about this real-life story, and I imagine there are going to be a lot of people out there who are watching this with a similar point of view.  In that regard, this is both an educational and enlightening film.  The narrative structure is smartly laid out, and it makes it so that you get to experience the mystery unravel. What was actually going on behind the curtain is really messed up and it affected so many people, it's staggering.  I know lawyers typically get a bad reputation, so it is refreshing to see one that is determined to make sacrifices to do the morally right thing.  It really is Mark Ruffalo's movie and he sells it, playing this nebbish man forced into a situation where he has to be courageous.  It's a modern-day David and Goliath, and you can't have a good underdog story without having a villain.  That is played here by Victor Garber who goes against type and plays somebody despicable.  Even though you don't really see him committing atrocities on screen, you still understand the gravity of the decisions he is making, always interested in turning a profit even when there is blood on his hands.  I do have a few complaints about this, and while they are minor, I do feel like they are valid.  I think the script is solid, but I do feel like there could have been some cuts made in the third act to tighten things up; the flow works much better at the front end, and I don't think this needs to lose a lot, only ten minutes or so.  Also, Anne Hathaway is fine in this as the wife, but I did find her to be a bit one-dimensional.  She does have one good scene that I loved, but I feel like if they weren't going to do more with her, they should have given the part to somebody less recognizable.  I don't think that enjoy is the right word given the depressing subject matter, but I did appreciate Dark Waters and it's something that I can recommend to almost everybody.",

I had cancer when I was 25 and I'm really starting to rethink what the actual cause was as there was no family history. With that notwithstanding, the acting is on point. I teared up multiple times and not because of riveting monologues, courtroom heroics or emotional pandering but because we've all been f-ed over by the corporations who have made trillions and trillions of dollars poisoning us with one lawyer going through hell for the truth. This movie may be a bit of a slow burn but there's an entire nation held to the flame by corporate greed and villainy. I'm not even super liberal or a tree hugging environmentalist but maybe I need to rethink that thanks to great directing by Todd Haynes, amazing acting by Mark Ruffalo and Oscar worthy supporting acting by Anne Hathaway.  I also enjoyed Tim Robbins quite a bit towering above everyone else. My recommendation is to see this and tell anyone who's tried reading the ingredients  in products we use everyday to the point of dismal futility and wondered who's protecting us, the trusting consumer to see it. And it goes without saying that those ingredient lists only list what they are required to list, meanwhile countless departments and divisions of Fortune 500 companies find ways around all that pesky red tape.",

            "content": "December 6, 2019 (wide)\n\nDespite \"Dark Waters\" being based on an ongoing true story, it's so blatant with its point of view that it has us asking the question, is this for real? The movie goes to such lengths to push our emotional buttons and make sure we understand its plot that we suspect the filmmakers didn't think much of our intelligence and therefore felt the need to coddle us into thinking and feeling a certain way. They're also either too in love with their own message or don't have enough faith in their ability to convey it subtly. Whatever the case, the film tries too hard and it loses us.\n\nAll this comes as a surprise given the talent behind and in front of the camera. Director Todd Haynes helms the picture, which is arguably his most safe and mainstream to date after such colorful and offbeat works as \"Velvet Goldmine,\" \"Far From Heaven\" and \"Carol.\" Because \"Dark Waters\" ends up being so mediocre by comparison, Haynes should stick with the colorful and offbeat; they suit him better.\n\nMark Ruffalo is the film's producer and star. He plays Robert Bilott, an environmental lawyer at Taft Stettinius & Hollister, a high-profile firm out of Cincinnati that serves mostly large corporate clients. Bilott has just made partner and his wife Sarah (Anne Hathaway), also an attorney, has just taken leave from her job to raise their newborn son. \n\nThe Bilotts are happy and comfortable at the moment, but that soon changes when dairy farmer Wilbur Tennant (Bill Camp), along with his brother Jim (Jim Azelvandre), storm into Rob's tidy office, dressed down in dirt-stained jeans, plaid shirts and rustic baseball caps. Wilbur has never met Rob but he insists he watch his VHS tapes and review other evidence that show how the DuPont chemical company's waste, which feeds into the creek near the Tennant farm, is killing Wilbur's cows, which have started twitching, hopping about uncontrollably, and charging Wilbur and his farmhands instead of allowing themselves to be milked. In addition to the VHS tapes, Wilbur has collected the cows' abnormally large organs and hidden them in his freezer.\n\nEven though Rob tells Wilbur he's not a plaintiff or private citizen lawyer, he decides to drive the three hours from Cincinnati to Parkersburg, West Virginia and visit the Tennant farm. After all, it was Rob's grandmother, who lives just outside Parkersburg, who gave Wilbur Rob's contact information. So, in way, Rob feels he has somewhat of a personal obligation to check thing outs. \n\nWhat Rob sees and learns on the Tennant farm doesn't sit well with him and he suddenly finds himself asking his boss, Tom Terp (Tim Robbins), for permission to conduct a standard, by-the-book investigation into DuPont, just to see if anything is amiss and confirm if the company is, as Wilbur claims, \"trying to cover something up.\" Rob starts digging further and, by and by, one document, lab report and obscure acronym quickly leads to another until it becomes clear DuPont does, in fact, have something to hide, namely that their products, with the most popular being the ubiquitous, non-stick coating substance Teflon, are pollutants and their improper disposal in the Parkersburg water supply are creating a public health crisis. It would take years, but scientists would eventually find a \"probable link\" between DuPont's chemicals and health disorders such as kidney cancer, testicular cancer, thyroid disease, high cholesterol, pre-eclampsia and ulcerative colitis.\n\nOf course, DuPont executives like Phil Donnelly (Victor Garber) are quick to dismiss the accusations, and when the soft-spoken Rob presses him at a black tie event, in order to paint Donnelly as evil a man as possible, the script has him drop an F-bomb for all to hear. \n\nNevertheless, Rob obtains a court order for DuPont to hand over all its documents related to perfluorooctanoic acid, cryptically referred to as \"PFOA,\" and before he knows it, a truckload of boxes containing more than 110,000 documents shows up at Taft's front door. For the next few months, Rob all but lives in a storage room, sifting each and every file, labeling them according to year with Post-it Notes, and getting the full scope on DuPont. He eventually pieces together a chilling narrative and explains to a concerned Sarah, who's now pregnant with their second child, the company has been poisoning the people (and animals) of Parkersburg by contaminating the town's water supply with unsafe levels of PFOA. He finds the company's shady practices go as far back as 1951 and finally, in 1999, about a year after Wilbur reached out to Rob, Rob files a federal suit against DuPont, which commences an ongoing fight to bring justice to anyone harmed by the company.\n\nAs the film chronicles its two decades, we get the usual assortment of questions, accusations, interviews, courtroom battles, public health screenings, etc. often associated with Hollywood legal dramas. It's clear to us early on that Rob is a good, humble man, willing to put in long hours, sacrifice time with his family, take pay cuts, and suffer both mentally and physically for his work (just as the film depicts, the real Rob endured stroke-like symptoms related to unusual brain activity, which were likely precipitated by stress brought on by the case).\n\nBut rather than simply show Rob behaving as a hero, the screenplay by Matthew Michael Carnahan and Mario Correa, based on Nathaniel Rich's New York Times Magazine article, \"The Lawyer Who Became DuPont's Worst Nightmare,\" also makes it a point to tell us, and not just once, but several times. There are at least three different scenes during which various characters speak explicitly about the good Rob is doing and that fighting a malfeasant corporation as large is DuPont is \"what justice is all about.\" It's as if Carnahan and Correa didn't trust us to pick up on Rob's \"goodism\" on our own, that it had to be underlined. This cajoling of the audience continues up through the end, when Johnny Cash's version of \"I Won't Back Down\" plays over the closing credits.\n\nIt's a shame the movie feels the need to overemphasize its main character's mission and values because this approach ends up being frustrating. The story \"Dark Waters\" wants to expose is a relevant and important one, but the filmmakers don't make us think very hard, consider the facts impartially, or form opinions of our own. The script does this for us, spelling things out in layman's terms and in too straightforward a manner. And rather than assume we'd be interested in the law and how it applies to a complex case like the people of Parkersburg vs DuPont, Haynes instead opts for easy emotional payoffs and flagrant grandstanding, like when Rob grills DuPont's CEO during a deposition and the other DuPont lawyers at the table whisper, \"We're done here\" and \"We're going on seven hours,\" as if we needed to be reminded of Rob's relentless dedication to his job and the common people he's representing. And just to make him seem more heroic and vulnerable, the film adds routine thriller elements to the mix, like Rob feeling paranoid because he thinks someone is following him or hesitating to start his car because it might explode.\n\nIf some aspects of the film feel manipulative, others feel over-the-top, including Bill Pullman as trial lawyer Harry Deitzler, who works with Rob on the case. Whether or not Pullman's accent and eccentricities invoke the real Deitzler is beside the point; his performance is too theatrical to be taken seriously and he hovers on being annoying. Plus, the movie is too willing to paint its other minor characters in simple black-white terms, with those from the DuPont legal camp only allowed to be evil and the families and blue-collar workers affected by DuPont's chemicals only allowed to be victims. For a story about such a long, complicated case, \"Dark Waters\" not very complicated\n\nFor the record, I'm not saying that what happens in \"Dark Waters\" isn't necessarily inaccurate or a misrepresentation of the truth, but accurate or not, it doesn't have to patronize us and the filmmakers would have been wise to let up on the melodrama a bit and allow the material to speak for itself. This is ultimately why I think it would have been better suited as a documentary that heard from both sides equally, presenting the story objectively and making it more well-rounded and interesting. Granted, we would likely walk away from such a non-fiction version with the same feelings \"Dark Waters\" forces upon us, but at least we would have developed those feelings on our own.",

Everything was dimly lit and unnaturally depressing- unless perhaps the projector for my auditorium had a bulb going out.  The music was ridiculous.  Entire scenes and montages were scored by vague atmospheric music with the occasional piano key strike.  You couldn't have scored the film better for the purpose of putting the audience to sleep if that had been your actual intent.  \n\nThe critics consensus claims that the film \"honors the victims.\"  Well, only in the sense that some of them and their family members get small and unflattering roles in the film, I suppose.  But the main victim character is portrayed as such a complete jerk that it's actually kind of hard to root for him even as his business is being destroyed and his health compromised for the sake of greed.  \n\nThis movie is a tedious grind, even setting aside the fact that you've basically seen practically the same story, told massively better, 20 years ago.  Perhaps even more tedious of a grind considering it's shot very much like a horror movie that suggests you're supposed to feel some level of suspense for which you never receive a payoff.  I suspect that at least half of the critics who claim to have enjoyed it are virtue-signalling rather than evaluating it as an actual film.  It's one of the worst-directed, worst-edited, and worst-scored movies I've ever seen, bar none.  \n\nThis may not be my least-favorite movie of the year, but it's certainly in the top 5 (and I see practically all of them), and it's gotta be in the top one or two for technical flaws.",

            "content": "Dark Waters is a Drama/Legal Thriller that tells the true story of the lawyer that went up against the powerful company DuPont (creators of Teflon, which we all have used at some point). Trying to expose them for chemical mishandling that has led to thousands of people getting all types of cancers, tumors, and birth deformities in the U.S. \n\nMark Ruffalo does a great job here cast as the main character, going through all the pitfalls (family, career, finances, all suffer) of fighting a powerful corporation in court.\nAnne Hathaway plays his wife (a former lawyer), who's tasked with keeping her sanity as her husband becomes obsessed with taking down DuPont at the detriment of their marriage. Tim Robbins plays his boss from the firm trying to figure out whether to green light a sue of DuPont.\n\nThis movie has a lot of chemical talk, but thankfully it is all explained perfectly for audiences (like myself) who know basic chemistry or none at all. As the story goes on, the facts about what DuPont did to people and animals knowingly is staggering. In fact, this case is still going on today. There are families still currently getting money from DuPont as \"restitution\" for poisoning them. \n\nIt really is an eye opening experience. Just Google DuPont and Teflon and you'll see what a mean. Thousands of people have suffered, especially in Northern East Coast. Mark Ruffalo gives a great performance along with nice cameo by Bill Pullman.\n\nFINAL REVIEW: 7.5 out of 10.",

Though the film takes a little while to get going, the creeping build-up explodes into an absolutely engrossing investigative procedural drama with pressingly urgent stakes reminiscent of 2015's 'Spotlight.'\n'Dark Waters' is a heavy piece, but there are just enough good deeds scattered throughout the film to save you wanting to off yourself after the onslaught of upsetting biographic catharses.

This movie really shocked me in a lot of ways and it definitely felt like the people behind it cared about the subject matter. Mark Ruffalo does a great job playing a relatively ordinary guy who truly has a heroic level of determination. I was rooting for his character the whole way through and thought Ruffalo made him feel real and likable. The movie is a bit slow here and there and I did find myself zoning out now and then, but I always felt the importance of the movie's subject. Regardless of some minor pacing issues, I still felt pretty riveted by the time the movie ended. Overall, this movie is an unsettling piece of real-life horror that feels very necessary and urgent.",

That's not to say director Todd Haynes's presence is never felt. He simply knows that the mere existentiality of this story itself is all the audience needs to stay in their seats. Whereas in other, lesser films you'd be informed. Here, you're upended. Instead of being intrigued, here, you're spellbound. Horrified instead of alarmed. And as far as widened perspectives are concerned? How about trying a major paradigm shift on for size in the form of this harrowing cinematic treatise on unchecked power, the pursuit for truth, and the tragic, infrastructural downward spiral taking place in so many parts of the American Rust Belt. Perhaps I'm just ridiculously uninformed, but I was utterly floored upon finishing this movie. It's an absolute feat for the subgenre, and one that should be seen by all.",

Though you have seen this scene in many movies it still catches and you wish the rest of the movie was as suspenseful.\n\n\"Dark Waters\" is about a lawyer who defended big companies and now is heading a class law suit against one of the biggest--Dupont! Mark Ruffalo plays Robert Bilott who has been just made partner of a well known admired law firm. He is not the sharp, $1,000 suit-wearing guy you mostly see in movies but when a farmer from West Virginia, a friend of his grandmother, comes in with a load of video tapes and eventually shows him where he has buried a hundred of his cows, along with the organs of many, Bilott feels he has no choice and takes the case against the thoughts of other partners.\n\nThe case takes almost 20 years to be decided and we follow along how Dupont not manipulated the government but also the people. You may not have heard of PFOA but you are familiar with Teflon which is not only used in cookware and how it  does kill people and disfigures babies.\n\nThis is very much a procedural movie without much dramatics but it handles 20 decades in a little over 2 hours smoothly and let's us get to know many of the characters who are real people as this film is based on a story originally written in the New York Times.\n\nIn the end credits you get to see some of the people but in the movie, along with Mark Ruffalo, the actors such as Anne Hathaway, Tim Robbins, Bill Pulman, Victor Garber and Bill Camp with others, do a solid job of making their characters believable.\n\nAs with many films this season \"Dark Waters\" runs over 2 hours and this one could have been a little tighter but director Todd Haynes had to cover 18-19 years and does it smartly.",

I thought Haynes created the perfect atmosphere in different scenes by making the contrast between the multiple locations visually clear which aided in creating a hearty emotional soup consisting of pity, horror, anger and sadness, to name a few.  Ruffalo was solid, as I have come to expect in these types of roles from him, but Bill Camp definitely stood out in this superb cast.  While the plot may sound slow and boring to some, I found this one anything but and would recommend this engaging drama universally.  I wouldn't even be surprised if this sneaks on to the back end of my 2019 top ten.\n*2019 Theater #61\n*AMC A-List #86",

Sure, there were times she was upset and impatient, but she stood by him to the end, and that was refreshing in this kind of story, when the writers so often drive the main character to the point he's a lone wolf, akin to that line out of the musical Evita: \"It's hard to keep momentum when it is you you are following.\" It still boggles my mind he sifted through ALL that discovery. The movie provided us a sense of the passage of time, but that exercise MUST have taken him well over a year. It HAD to have! I recommend Dark Waters highly.",

Seriously, I thought of walking out.  I got my iPhone out (a big no-no) to look for other movies in the theatre I might want to sneak into after I walked out of this one.  Then, suddenly, a scene gripped my interest.  I put the phone away and started watching.  The movie slowly pulled me in (albeit very slowly) and I watched despite my utter distaste for the cinematographer's aesthetic.  The acting is solid and sometimes even superb although the pace is much like a turtle who doesn't even know it's in a race.  But it became riveting and in the end I'm glad I stayed.  The story needed to be told and it is a fitting time to tell it.  People are waking up.  Let's add to the momentum.  Maybe a similar story will be told about our cell phones one day.  Or vaccines.  Or the countless pharmaceuticals and over-the-counter pills and even the food we poison (Or sedate) ourselves with every day.  The moral of the story comes when he says something akin to \"there's no one looking out for you, you have to look out for yourself (and your fellow human beings)\".  The government doesn't care about you and won't protect you!  \"We protect us.\"  So don't expect the government to have your back.  Be skeptical of everything and protect yourself, your loved ones, and all of humanity if you can.   That's the bottom line and he learned this from an uneducated farmer.  Well now it's time for the rest of America to learn that too.",

Sounds good.\n\nIf you weren't paranoid before, you will be now.\n\nSYNOPSIS:\nThis is the story based on a real person named \"Robert Bilott\" and inspired by an article titled \"The Lawyer Who Became DuPont's Worst Nightmare.\" Robert Bilott (Mark Ruffalo) is a lawyer who primarily defends chemical corporations until a farmer from his old town of West Virginia asks for help to prove that there are chemicals being dumped in the water that is the cause of large amount of cow deaths. Although unconvinced at first, through excessive research and digging, Robert begins to find horrifying evidence of something much worse than just a deadly chemical to cows, but humans and all creatures alike.\n\nDIRECTION:\nIf I'm being honest, I don't have much to say in this realm. The direction by Todd Haynes was as technically solid as any other good film. Yes, just \"good.\" The color palette was probably a little too dull even for the subject matter and really the film's strong points really lye in the writing and some strong performances. I feel almost any other director could've done the same job, if not better.\n\nWRITING:\nThe writing is definitely a step up from the directing. The writing isn't perfect as there are some scenes that almost seemed unnecessary and just had me thinking \"get to the story!\" Now, there is much to be said about how much time and effort it must've been to retrieve all of this information and translate it to script. Yes, it's been done before, ie: Spotlight, Zodiac, etc., but this is quite possibly one of the most important stories to be told today as this is something that is still affecting everyone... TODAY. It is based on the NYTIMES article \"The Lawyer Who Became DuPont's Worst Nightmare\" by Nathanial Rich, but obviously there was far more research than a 10ish page article.\n\nACTING:\nThe acting is definitely where the juice is at. This is where you take your regular beef sandwich and baptize it (In case you're not american enough to know what this means, it means you dump in in the beef juice). Mark Ruffalo gives a similarly excellent performance as he did in Spotlight. WOAH WOAH, I didn't say it was AS good, I said it was SIMILAR. Cool it, Mary. It's expected, but he really makes the film what it is. Anne Hathaway is great, as usual, but her role as the wife wasn't integral to the story. I understand showing he has a life outside of work with kids and a wife and showing the kid's grow older and older gives substance to the prolonged journey Robert is taking, but these were the scenes I felt could've been cut or replaced. Tim Robbins is in this and some other people and some other people. All did well, just kind've interchangeable.\n\nCONCLUSION:\nMr. John \"The Sexy and Over-qualified or something Critic Guy\" Yanulis, you rated this film a 3.5/5, yet after reading your overly long review it seems like a high rating. What can I say? I like it Ruff and I'm a sucker for investigative films on important and interesting topics. Also, I prefer rating my films on a 1-10 bases, but I'm limited. So really for me this film is like a 6.6/10.",

Every year some movies come along, with something you don't necessarily want to look at, but are better off for becoming aware of than not. Dark Waters is one of those films. Here is a case of big money vs. public health.  The real indictment goes back to the consumer. There is a valid question of how responsible we individuals are for what is in our environment, and what goes into our bodies.  Can ordinary citizens make decisions if we are kept ignorant?  Perhaps we want the products and the jobs of industry, and so willfully do not want to know how the sausage is made and its remnants are disposed of, in order that we may sleep at night. In other words, this movie is a thinking person's film. The direction and performances are fine, including the leads of Mark Ruffalo and Anne Hathaway.  Bill Camp playing the role of a cattle farmer who raises the alarm, merits a best supporting actor nomination this season.  DW doesn't seem like something people ought to rush to see, but as I have alluded, it is consciousness raising. The subject is real, including the stories of birth \"defects\".

Defense attorney Robert Billot is contacted by a West Virginian farmer whose cows are mysteriously dying. After digging through countless reports and documents, Billot is able to connect several human and animal illnesses, mutations and deaths to one of the world's largest corporations, DuPont the commodity chemical company. He then puts everything including his job, family and health at risk to expose one of the greatest cover-ups in American history. \nDirector Todd Haynes brilliantly tells this urgent story about a company lying to the government, poisoning the people of America and getting away with it. His attention to detail in capturing the passage of time is one of his greatest assets in reminding the audience of how long Billot has been fighting DuPont. Mark Ruffalo shines in the role of Rob Billot who does his best to warn characters in the film and audience members of the danger they are in to this day. Anne Hathaway plays a crucial supporting role and it's also nice to see Tim Robbins in a major film again, but the greatest performance of the film to me was Bill Camp as Wilbur Tennant, the farmer who reaches out to Billot in the first place. While not the largest part in the film, Camp's performance is Oscar worthy, as he is the emotional weight behind Billot's actions. Being an actor I was unfamiliar with, I genuinely thought he was the real Tennant. \nDark Waters is an informative piece on why we should fight for those who can't, why we should all be cautious of large corporations, why we should never give up hope. A definite recommendation for those who love legal dramas/thrillers.",

Ever since I first saw the trailer I've been looking forward to this movie, not really realizing I'd leave the theater truly horrified thinking about the movie I had just watched. That's right, Dark Waters is a horror movie and if you're like me and have used any Teflon or water proofing products, we're all living it. \n\nAt this point I'm personally convinced Mark Ruffalo can do no wrong when it comes to making movies. His portrayal of real life attorney Rob Billett, as a quiet, almost fragile but steadfast in his beliefs and convictions was nothing short of phenomenal. \n\nNow, the rest of the movie filled with some great performers like Anne Hathaway, Tim Robbins, Victor Garber, and Bill Pullman, just to name a few. It's a real life David vs Goliath, as a chemical company corporate defense attorney first asked by a small town cattle farmer to go after Dupont, one of if not, the largest chemical company in the country. You see the horrifying reality of what the chemical they knowingly poisoned people with does to cattle and people. Meanwhile even with all the evidence stacked against Dupont, most people still believed that this company would never do anything wrong.\n\nThis movie was the scariest horror movie of all time, because it's real, and what Rob Billett is doing and has done doesn't make him the hero we deserve, he's the hero we need. In conclusion, see this movie, you'll leave the theater truly thinking about what you had just watched and you won't be disappointed in the movie or the acting.",

Mark Ruffalo gives a very real performance, as does Anne Hathaway. Neither of them are in the environment they are usually in, and yet, they make it feel as if their characters are. It also pulls information out of areas that were probably rather hard to dig into, as the final scene of the movie occurs in 2015, which feels all to recent for many a viewer, and the final text tells of events that are still happening today. A lot of the time, the MPAA looks at movies like this and tries to edit them down to make their PG-13 rating less true to title so kids can come see the movie. However, this is not the case with this movie. The movie has very little graphic content, but when it feels the need to be graphic, it allows itself to do so. Furthermore, this is the only PG-13 film I have witnessed recently that openly drops 2 F-bombs, as many films either edit them out or do something subtle, like how Venom put its Eminem song in the credits. This film has two F-bombs dropped in central moments of the film and given full focus. That is simply daring. However, my personal favorite thing about the film is the fact that it feels like a two hour movie. The movie doesn't fly by, it goes at a realistic pace, with no filler or unnecessary information given. It is a perfectly paced, perfectly acted and perfectly presented movie, and so far, my favorite film of this year.",

            "content": "Dark Waters is a compelling look at one man's fight against the corrupt practices of a multi-billion dollar company. \n\nBased on a true story, Dark Waters follows Rob Bilott (Mark Ruffalo), a corporate lawyer who gets a call from a family friend named Wilbur (Bill Camp) about a disturbance on his farm in West Virginia. Over 100 of Wilbur's cows have died and he suspects it has something to do with the creek running through his property. Wilbur's hunch becomes a frightening truth as Rob investigates decades' worth of wrong-doing by the DuPont chemical company.\n\nMark Ruffalo portrayal of Rob Bilott is excellent. He's plays the legal scenes with conviction, but he feels more like a vessel to receive information than a fully- formed character. We see plenty of Bilott's moral standards, but we rarely get a sense of what drives him to do the work he does or who he is emotionally. It makes it harder to fully connect with and invest in his character. A performance worth noting with much less screen time is Bill Pullman as lawyer Harry Dietzler. Pullman gives Dark Waters a boost of energy. He's not comedic relief, but he's certainly a breath of fresh air. \n\nTodd Haynes's direction is both impressive and overbearing. Haynes has a flair for stylistic flourishes in his other films and here the moody, muted lighting that clouds much of the film creates a feeling of anxiety that makes every step of Rob's journey and what he discovers uncomfortable in a way that's very effective. By the same token, the color scheme is dark and dreary throughout and the film ends up with a dull sheen and a tone that feels at times heavy-handed. \n\nAn aspect of the filmmaking I love is the use of tracking shots to show not only the lives that DuPont destroyed, but the communities too. Dark Waters is unflinching when it comes to depicting the consequences of DuPont's malpractice. It tells and more specifically, shows it, in a way that rightfully stirs up an audience reaction of anger and injustice.\n\nI recommend Dark Waters for ages 12 to 18 for some shocking images and brief language. I give it 3 out of 5 stars. If you're looking for a good or feel-good time at the cinema for the holidays, this isn't it, but Dark Waters is definitely an informative and important film. \n\nReviewed by Benjamin P., KIDS FIRST!

I actually think the movie works really well, but I can't identify the filmmaker who brought us Velvet Goldmine, Carol or Far From Heaven here.  Written by Mario Correa and Matthew Michael Carnahan, the story spans decades, promisingly opening with an eerie Jaws-like sequence in which some 1970s teens swim naked in a polluted West Virginia lake.  You can feel Haynes in this scene more than anywhere else in the film, considering its haunting, dreamlike imagery.  \n\nFlashing forward to the late 1990s, the story properly starts when a farmer named Wilbur Tennant (a magnificent Bill Camp) barges in on Cincinnati Corporate Attorney Robert Bilott (Mark Ruffalo) to demand he return to his home town in West Virginia to investigate why his cattle have all started dying.  At first dismissing him as a crazy rube, Bilott decides to make the 120 mile drive to see for himself.  It doesn't hurt that his biggest client, DuPont, has a plant there which just may be poisoning the water supply.  Spoiler alert: They are!\n\nOne night at a fancy dinner, Bilott confronts a DuPont executive (a perfectly insidious Victor Garber) and gets such an obvious brush-off that he can't help but go down that rabbit hole.  Risking his standing at his law firm, presided over by Tom Terp (an unpredictable and passionate performance by Tim Robbins), to launch an investigation which takes over 20 years to complete.

Yes, the great cinematographer Ed Lachman has a wonderful way of making you feel every bitter cold early sunset with his black, grey and dark blue color schemes.  Yes, the very talented and versatile production designer Hannah Beachler knows her way around working class homes.  It all comes together as a consistently bleak presentation, tailor made to make you feel the sheer hopelessness of taking on \"the man\".  \n\nRuffalo does incredible work as a defeated, hunched over workaholic who never gives up the fight.  We see nothing showy in his performance.  He carries the weight of the world on his shoulders when he realizes that DuPont has exposed almost the entire population on earth to harmful chemicals.  Hathaway also does excellent work as someone in the typical \"wife\" role who refuses to be identified as such.  She very slyly walks that fine line to give us something heartfelt and strong.  Bill Camp, however, walks away with the film with his almost indecipherable drawl and righteous anger at a system which ignores the safety and well being of the hard working citizens of the world.  Often specializing in low key characterizations, he switches gears and goes unforgettably big and loud.

But suitably important and that is enough to peddle.\n\nDark Waters\n\nThe director Todd Haynes's desk is under tons and tons of paper. The challenging ones are shuffled in a two hour narration and sprinkled incoherently as opposed to a proper structure. It is very rare to see a film that is directed by someone and written by someone else and still lacks a definite pattern. Maybe that is the pattern or simply I don't get it- it's usually the latter one, trust me. But what Todd needs primarily is steadiness. Accepting the calmness, the patience that a job like such offers. Waiting for the formality to settle in and then stir the soup. He is just not ready to let it sit for a while. What we then get is always, everything is said to be in motion, no matter how inedible it grows. It is preposterous how the family drama, the conflict that could have easily rattled you, instead just disenchants you from buying into what they care about. It takes a lot of time for them to finally get into our head, almost in its final act, do we get to sit and mourn, meaningfully. To be honest, I am also going to blame the lack of chemistry between Anne Hathaway and Mark Ruffalo. Ruffalo who is basically a wild bear wearing a suit with manners and etiquette like some member of a White House joining for a big dinner, Hathaway unfortunately feels too sober to enjoy and let it affect her. She is simply not open enough. She had to hold the inner \"warning\" monologue of Ruffalo and instead she is found to be a delicious side dish that just doesn't fit into this cruel chemically conspired world.",

            "content": " Immersed for two and a half hours in the ugly Dark Waters world of institutional corruption and human greed, I left the theater and drove directly to Safeway to pick up a few last minute items for Thanksgiving. Studying canned fruit options, I started reliving teenage memories of mixing Dole fruit cocktail with newly invented Kraft Cool Whip, proudly declaring it a centerpiece holiday salad. Completely lost in daydreams of Thanksgivings past, I turned around and there staring at me was a display of nonstick frying pans! C8 alert! Corporate greed, government sellouts, Wall Street espionage, stacked court decisions, arson, Mad Cow disease, birth defects, cancer\u2014all traced back to PFOA or C8, chemical talk for toxic fluorocarbons, aka Teflon! Doomsday in the canned fruit aisle! Dark Waters is an environmental drama based on the true David and Goliath story of Cincinnati corporate attorney Robert Bilott (Mark Ruffalo) who goes up against DuPont, a mega machine of greed. The story starts in 1989 with Bilott pulled from a partner meeting to be confronted by West Virginia cattle farmer, Wilbur Tennant (Bill Camp), who suspects DuPont of contaminating his Appalachian farm\u2019s water supply, killing off his cattle. Tennnant, referred by Bilott\u2019s grandmother, is outraged, agonizing over his bovine \u201clike family\u201d die-off, burying each cow in individual graves until the deaths are too numerous to keep up. In a flash of costuming brilliance, \u201cBlack Suits meet Bib Overalls,\u201d the Blue Collar vs. Corporate America showdown is set for the rest of the film. Thus begins a lengthy eco-crusade\u2014that is still playing out to this day. If there is a way, legal or not, for DuPont execs to avoid, defer, bury, squash, squelch, threaten and delay justice, they do it and with impunity. But once Bilott is made a believer\u2014after wading through a dusty box of Tennant\u2019s VHS evidence tapes and a frightening up close and personal mad cow encounter\u2014he doggedly stalks and sues DuPont in perpetuity. Currently, Bilott is bringing a major class action lawsuit against eight different chemical companies, on behalf of everyone in the United States. Dark Waters reinforces so much of the sad state of affairs we face in our country, brace yourself for your own reality check. Mine was Teflon in Safeway. Yours could be pretty much anywhere given the pervasive use of toxic chemicals. Choose your poison. On top of a bleak glimpse at the squalid underbelly of capitalism, the movie plods along dragging us through a visual timeline that starts in 1975 and phases out at 2015. I found myself calculating how many dreary years were left. If you\u2019re hoping for an Erin Brockovich happy ending, best stay home. Dark Waters is a depressing commentary on the staggering power of corporate greed. PFOA, a chemical compound engineered to create fabulously successful Teflon is now used in everything from raincoats to pizza boxes, infiltrating 99% of human life. DuPont wields so much influence at the highest levels of government that the conglomerate can freely produce this chemical poison, still completely unregulated, without so much as a personal injury shrug. DuPont even ran and then concealed their own studies that conclusively linked PFOA to employee illnesses and birth defects. Now we all know about it. Yet, nothing changes. Surely, for the sake of public health we can do better! Sadly, it doesn\u2019t appear to be a matter of can\u2019t so much as won\u2019t. A Nov. 19 letter written by 17 West Virginia Republicans to the U.S House of Representatives Committee on Oversight and Reform, which had a hearing earlier that day, \u201cToxic, Forever Chemicals: A Call for Immediate Federal Action on PFAS,\u201d had very little to say about the hearings, but did come out swinging at the film, \u201cWe ask that you be aware that the PFAS-centered film \u2018Dark Waters\u2019 irresponsibly uses tired stereotypes about the people of West Virginia. The film\u2019s portrayal does not reflect reality and can do real damage to our economy\u2026So either the filmmakers are fabricating science or they are relying on vulgar stereotypes to sell movie tickets. Neither is acceptable to us. An irresponsible film like \u2018Dark Waters\u2019 puts tourism jobs at risk based on a lie.\u201d Based on a lie\u2026Is this our legacy? ",

The blue grey coldness that seeps into the shots reflects the insidious corporate crimes making their way into the flesh and bones of the victims. Haynes brilliantly represents the tragedy of bodies and the earth ravaged by industry and corporate greed. This film shows how the consumer and the victims of environmental pollution (mainly farmers and the poor) are abused and hurt by corporate greed. It is an astonishing portrait of courage and perseverance. Showing us that we can indeed overcome evil if we care enough to wake up and try.  I give dark waters an \"A\". The reviewer missed it completely.",

The film's excellent script does a fine job explaining the complex litigious questions involved, detailing the implications of the crusaders' actions without resorting to jargon or unfathomable legalese. Then there are the superb performances of Mark Ruffalo as the heroic lawyer and Bill Camp as his outraged and victimized client. This is an important story, one that's well told and doesn't hold anything back, a tale that should inspire us all to action when it comes to tragedies such as this.",

Though you have seen this scene in many movies it still catches and you wish the rest of the movie was as suspenseful.\"Dark Waters\" is about a lawyer who defended big companies and now is heading a class law suit against one of the biggest--Dupont! Mark Ruffalo plays Robert Bilott who has been just made partner of a well known admired law firm. He is not the sharp, $1,000 suit-wearing guy you mostly see in movies but when a farmer from West Virginia, a friend of his grandmother, comes in with a load of video tapes and eventually shows him where he has buried a hundred of his cows, along with the organs of many, Bilott feels he has no choice and takes the case against the thoughts of other partners.The case takes almost 20 years to be decided and we follow along how Dupont not manipulated the government but also the people. You may not have heard of PFOA but you are familiar with Teflon which is not only used in cookware and how it  does kill people and disfigures babies.This is very much a procedural movie without much dramatics but it handles 20 decades in a little over 2 hours smoothly and let's us get to know many of the characters who are real people as this film is based on a story originally written in the New York Times.In the end credits you get to see some of the people but in the movie, along with Mark Ruffalo, the actors such as Anne Hathaway, Tim Robbins, Bill Pulman, Victor Garber and Bill Camp with others, do a solid job of making their characters believable.As with many films this season \"Dark Waters\" runs over 2 hours and this one could have been a little tighter but director Todd Haynes had to cover 18-19 years and does it smartly.",

Grammatically incorrect and even lofty in its speech. But suitably important and that is enough to peddle.Dark WatersThe director Todd Haynes's desk is under tons and tons of paper. The challenging ones are shuffled in a two hour narration and sprinkled incoherently as opposed to a proper structure. It is very rare to see a film that is directed by someone and written by someone else and still lacks a definite pattern. Maybe that is the pattern or simply I don't get it- it's usually the latter one, trust me. But what Todd needs primarily is steadiness. Accepting the calmness, the patience that a job like such offers. Waiting for the formality to settle in and then stir the soup. He is just not ready to let it sit for a while. What we then get is always, everything is said to be in motion, no matter how inedible it grows. It is preposterous how the family drama, the conflict that could have easily rattled you, instead just disenchants you from buying into what they care about. It takes a lot of time for them to finally get into our head, almost in its final act, do we get to sit and mourn, meaningfully. To be honest, I am also going to blame the lack of chemistry between Anne Hathaway and Mark Ruffalo. Ruffalo who is basically a wild bear wearing a suit with manners and etiquette like some member of a White House joining for a big dinner, Hathaway unfortunately feels too sober to enjoy and let it affect her. She is simply not open enough. She had to hold the inner \"warning\" monologue of Ruffalo and instead she is found to be a delicious side dish that just doesn't fit into this cruel chemically conspired world.",

This is a film people should see.  Just don\u2019t expect a pleasant journey, much less a mindless escape.In 1999, Rob Bilott (Mark Ruffalo) is a corporate attorney in a Cincinnati firm that specializes in defending chemical companies.  When a farmer from Parkersburg, WV, suddenly appears at the office, claiming that humans and animals were being affected by the runoff from the local Dupont plant, Bilott ultimately switches sides and takes the case.  At this point, we\u2019re introduced to PFOA (also called C-8), a chemical compound used by 3M (Scotchgard) and Dupont (Teflon).  It would be tempting to launch into endless details about the well-documented lying, foot-dragging and general malfeasance of Dupont (as far back as 1961, Dupont\u2019s internal medical studies showed that C-8 posed enormous health risks for their own employees).  Since this is a movie review, suffice it to say that corporate transparency and civic responsibility are not key themes in this film.  In the hands of a director less skilled than Todd Haynes (\u201cSafe,\u201d \u201cCarol,\u201d \u201cFar from Heaven\u201d), this film might have been a polarizing, over-the-top political diatribe.  But Haynes veers away from vitriolic exposition, instead infusing the film with a consistently ominous score and dark, washed-out visuals that convey much more about impotent rage and pervasive hopelessness than any speech could accomplish.As the main character, Mark Ruffalo is excellent.  He again conjures up the righteous indignation and poignant disappointment that suffused his character in \u201cSpotlight.\u201d  But here, his role is a bit more complex, with Bilott\u2019s Midwestern diffidence and deference initially obscuring his dogged determination to pursue the case.  Tim Robbins is powerful as his boss, Tom Terp.  Bill Pullman and Anne Hathaway make forgettable appearances.  As the initial plaintiff, long-time actor Bill Camp (also seen in this year\u2019s \u201cJoker\u201d and \u201cThe Kitchen\u201d) steals the show as a gruff, blunt, no-nonsense man who just wants common sense to prevail.This is a film intended to stir outrage.  It succeeds.  According to Nathaniel Rich\u2019s January 6, 2016, article in the \u201cNew York Times Magazine,\u201d which forms the basis for this film, data from nearly 70,000 West Virginia blood samples has demonstrated that PFOA causes \u201ckidney cancer, thyroid cancer, high cholesterol, pre-eclampsia and ulcerative colitis.\u201d  Today, EPA\u2019s website defines a safe PFOA level as .007 parts per billion.  On average, Americans harbor 4 parts per billion in their bodies.  Nearly every American ever tested has PFOA in the bloodstream.  But even now, EPA offers only \u201chealth advisories\u201d on PFOA, guidance that its website defines as \u201cnon-enforceable and non-regulatory.\u201d  Outrageous, indeed.",
