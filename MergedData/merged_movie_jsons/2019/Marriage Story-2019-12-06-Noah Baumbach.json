            "content": "If you want a feel-good flick, I strongly advise you to reconsider watching \"Marriage Story\". I am NOT saying it's a bad film, in fact, it's amazingly good. But it's also amazingly realistic....and painful to watch due to the subject matter.The story is an ultra-realistic story about a marriage that is dissolving...and it's painful because the viewer really grows to like Charlie (Adam Driver) and Nicole (Scarlett Johansson). Like real life, neither character is totally bad and you understand both of their positions during the divorce....but it also is very ugly and awful to see what happens when lawyers get involved. Instead of the amicable divorce they both originally agreed to, it soon becomes ugly....and the pair and their devilish lawyers begin going at each other like pitbulls on a side of beef! Again...this is NOT a criticism...it's realistic and heart-wrenching to watch. I found myself crying during some of the ugliest scenes....and I am sure I wasn't alone in the theater!Overall, you see Johansson and Driver put on some amazing performances....so amazing that I'd be shocked if they aren't at least Oscar-nominated for this film. Well done in every way...and one of the better movies of 2019.",

            "content": "Surely this must have drawn heavily from writer/director Baumbach's own experiences. He was married to Jennifer Jason Leigh and they have one son, plus before they divorced in 2013 he began a relationship with Greta Gerwig in 2011. So he probably lived much of what is depicted here.The two principals, Adam Driver as Brooklyn stage director Charlie Barber and Scarlett Johansson as actress Nicole Barber, are superb in their roles. While it seemed like they were happily married for 10-odd years, with an 8-yr-old son, Nicole began to more and more feel that her own desires were being ignored while as a married couple they always did what Charlie wanted. When she gets an opportunity to take a TV role in Los Angeles she also decides that it is the right time for the two of them to split up. Charlie is blindsided.It is often a hard story to watch because even to the end it is clear that, in spite of the required animosities during divorce proceedings, Nicole and Charlie have a bond and care deeply for each other.My wife and I (both having gone through divorces of our own years ago) watched this on DVD from our public library.",

My son was only 2 when we were divorced and all of the ups and downs and petty fights and anger that we had for each other was exhausting but we went through it all just to fight for him, who we both love more than anything. We said horrible things to each other we can never take back but we didn't really mean and we both eventually found a way to make it work for him and to protect him from the ugliness. We made it through to the other side and have a good relationship now and work as a team to raise him with love and support but it was a long road out of hell to get there. This movie portrayed that in a way I would never have expected. It made me cry numerous times thinking of how hopeless and angry I was for so long and in that I feel like this movie deserves every accolade it gets. It felt genuine and painful but with hope at the end. It's real and powerful.",

            "content": "With many directors, producers and actors blaming Netflix and other streaming services for what could end up being the end of cinema as we know, the streaming service is releasing several films in theatres for a number of weeks to be eligible for consideration during awards season. Many theatres are boycotting this strategy, so aren't playing Netflix's films at all. The theatres in mostly bigger cities around the world that do play them , are selling tickets like hotcakes. After their short theatrical run, Netflix will make their Original Film available for their members. With Marriage Story, Netflix might even get their first Best Picture award handed over to them.Noah Baumbach's Marriage Story is an incisive and compassionate look at a marriage breaking up and a family staying together. While we flash through important and daily situations, we hear Nicole (Scarlett Johansson) explain what she loves about her husband Charlie (Adam Driver). Charlie loves being a dad, and how it's almost annoying how much he loves it. He cries easily in movies. He's very competitive, undaunted and is very clear about what he wants. These are only a few things Nicole loves about him. After that, it's Charlie's turn to tell us what he loves about his wife Nicole. She's a great dancer - infectious. She's a mother who plays, really plays. She gives great presents. While we hear this couple recite what they've written down, we get to meet them post-break-up in a marriage mediator's office. This was part of an assignment, to fully understand why they got married in the first place. Nicole doesn't want to hear what Charlie has written down, so what's been put in writing is only something we, as the audience, get to hear out loud.What follows then is an emotionally raw journey into growing up, while trying to figure out how to survive on your own. Happiness is a personal feeling and can't be disguised as something as trivial as washing dishes or forgetting a grocery list on your way to the supermarket. We get to know little about Charlie's childhood, but Nicole's family and home are something that's right in the middle of everything. There's also their son Henry (Azhy Robertson), who gets pulled into this. Nicole thinks Henry is just like his father - almost joined to the hip. But when their marriage crumbles, and distance becomes an important factor in Henry's upbringing, their assumptions are solely things that have been witnessed while being together, and are now changing rapidly.The change in personality, after splitting up and having to deal with divorce, becomes very clear in both Nicole and Charlie's behaviour. While Nicole seems very focused, meek and motherly, she turns into a woman who knows what she wants and isn't holding back anymore. The only thing she's holding back in front of Charlie - are tears. As if she doesn't want him to see how vulnerable and damaged she is by everything that's changing. \"Love doesn't make sense\", and no truer words have ever been spoken. Charlie on the other hand, who's always been confident and career driven, is now crumbling down, defeated and uncertain of the future.The cast is phenomenal. Adam Driver is the strongest of the bunch - a transformative, unseen, heartbreaking performance that no one will be able to shut up about during this year's awards season, and deservedly so. Everyone is feeding off his energy and bringing their triple A-game to this truly exceptional film. Scarlett Johansson has never been better, playing a broken woman who wants the best for her family but can no longer wait for her dreams to become reality. Laura Dern as Nicole's divorce attorney is Elle Woods all grown up and commands your attention. Ray Liotta in a comeback to the big screen (his last big film was in 2014's 'Sin City: A Dame To Kill For'), makes you wonder where he's been all this time. Merritt Wever and Julie Hagerty as Nicole's sister and mother don't get much screen time, but are here for some unexpectedly superb comic relief.Baumbach also wrote the film and deserves all the accolades - a true master in writing and directing. He makes all of it seem effortless, with unprecedented results. The way he gets his cast to deliver minutes of dialogue, while his DOP, Robbie Ryan, zooms in and out, follows and swirls around them, to then play with shifting between different actor's facial expressions in silent moments, is utterly enchanting. The cherry on top is Randy Newman coming back to compose a score for a live action film (his last live action film was 2008's 'Leatherheads') - masterful!Marriage Story will get discussed in film school, years from now. It has everything to become an all time classic and will proudly get called one of the best films of the decade. A melancholic, heavy-hearted yet joyously bittersweet story about marriage and its unfortunate path to severance in order to find happiness. No cheek will be left dry.",

            "review_title": "A witty and sad portrait of modern marriage",
            "content": "It is refreshing to see a film that can both warmly respect and ruthlessly dissect the institution of marriage. While every marriage is unique, there are universal scenarios that can signal their demise. Two of these are central to Marriage Story (2019): the film forensically examines what happens when one partner's ego swallows another, then shows the destructive force that is unleashed when lawyers come between otherwise still-caring partners.The storyline is simple, linear, and dialogue-heavy. In the opening minutes we see respected theatre director Charlie (Adam Driver) and his increasingly successful actress wife Nicole (Scarlett Johansson) in the middle of a marital mediation session. He is opening a new play on Broadway while she will be taking their young son to Los Angeles to star in a TV pilot. The session stalls despite their obvious regard for each other and their commitment to avoid lawyers in a marriage split.Classic marital tension lines become palpably clear. Charlie and Nicole met when he was a high-profile director and she a theatre novice, and this imbalance of egos remain embedded in all aspects of their relationship. Although a loving father, the self-absorbed Charlie had an affair which is now being weaponised as she asserts her identity and needs. She decides to engage a lawyer forcing him to follow suit or lose custody of their young son; the communication drawbridge is pulled up as the lawyers amplify every marital issue into a war cry on an ever more blood-splattered battlefield.Nothing new here, you might say, except for two bright lights in a dark place: Adam Driver and Scarlett Johansson. He is perfect in playing the broad faced deer-in-the-spotlight hapless male, confused over his marital and parental mess-ups...but he sings a beautiful song. She is brilliant in playing a wife no longer willing to be invisible despite still loving the man she married. An ensemble of lawyers include a benignly caring advisor (Alan Alda) and ruthless warriors who take no prisoners (Laura Dern and Ray Liotta).You don't need to be a divorce voyeur to find this well-trodden story highly absorbing, mostly because the two stars make it hard to take sides. Charlie's weaknesses are not unforgiveable and his love for his son and wife continue. Nicole has a right to her own independent future but still feels strongly about him. If lawyers were not involved, things could be very different. Marriage Story is an insightful, witty, and sad portrait of how easily a marital fairytale can turn to a nightmare.",

But motivations are clear and the story is really well told. The drama unfolds and it does not seem to be made up, rather really slow burning and quite reasonable (well as reasonable as some of the things can be).Having said all that, the performances really are something. Both leads have their say and while we seem to stay focused on the man mostly, both have winning arguments. As I already have suggested in my summary line, this can be viewed as a modern day Kramer vs. Kramer movie. Not sure if that is what they set out to do or thought of, but I only mean it in the best possible way. This really brings home certain things, even if you never lived them",

Beautifully acted and superbly written, you can make the case that this is one of the best films of the year & may win the big prize in February. But perhaps its most impressive accomplishment was being relatable for people who've never been in a similar situation. But Baumbach's script deals with very human issues that create a film that feels like it has real stakes. It doesn't feel Hollywood-ized even though it's based on a famous Hollywood couple.

            "content": "It's hard to find words to describe why \"Marriage Story\" is amazing. Everybody already said everything the needed to be said. It was a truly powerful and emotional journey that deserves to be revisited again and again. The strongest aspects of the movie are the writing and the performances and you can say that the story has been done many times before, but it goes so deep in the way it explores the characters that i found it fascinating to watch. You understand the two main characters, since their motivations are very clear and if you going to side with one character over the other - this does not mean that the other character doesn't give some valid points.The scene where Nicole (Scarlett Johansson) and Charlie (Adam Driver) are arguing with each other was fantastic. That alone was the best scene that i saw the whole year. It was truly heartbreaking and hard to watch. If it was directed by a different person, then the scene would not work and it would have come out very cheesy and it could have been very hard to take it seriously.The only problems that i had with the movie is the performance of Julie Hagerty (Nicole's mother), which i wasn't a huge fan, but i don't think that everyone will have that problem; Nicole's sister didn't play a huge role in the story and the movie had to remind us that she's still here and the score by Randy Newman was 40% great, while the other 60% was repeating the same track over and over.Even with it's flaws, it's still one of the best movies of 2019 and i cannot wait to see it again. I'm giving \"Marriage Story\" a 9/10.",

            "content": "'Marriage Story' directed by Noah Baumbach has been compared by many people to 'Kramer Vs. Kramer 'and I can't help suspecting that this comparison was encouraged by or even originated in the PR machine of the film's producers. There are indeed many similar traits: both films belong to the genre of 'divorce films' and have as protagonists couples who have serious reasons to break up but also maintain strong emotional bonds; in both stories there is a child at an age at which the separation of parents cannot remain without the sequels who becomes the main subject of the custody dispute and divorce settlement; lawyers play an important role in deepening the conflicts; in the lead roles in the two films appear well-known and highly talented actors who combine their magnetism (of attraction and rejection), managing to create difficult-to-forget broken couples on screens. It remains to be seen if this recipe will work with the same success at the 40-year interval that separates the release of the two films. Matching the five Academy Awards collected by 'Kramer Vs. Kramer' is a challenge.What has changed in the dynamics of divorce and the attitude of society in the 40 years that separate the two films? Charlie and Nicole, the divorced of 2019, could ultimately retain their affection and share the responsibility of child custody without lawyers or the institution of marriage, but eventually the social pressure brings them in the situation of the classic couples in legal conflict. As in the 1979 film, it is the wife who initiates the divorce, but the world has changed and the reasons have changed. Joana Kramer (Meryl Streep) was leaving Ted Kramer (Dustin Hoffman) because he was too busy with his professional life and neglected his father and family duties. Charlie from 'Marriage Story' (Adam Driver) is an almost perfect husband and father, but the marriage suffocates Nicole (Scarlett Johansson) whose career as an actress stagnates in the shadow of the talented theater director who is her husband. The characters in Noah Baumbach's film are equal in professional aspirations, and in the affection that continues beyond the legal conflict and the legal separation, and also in the responsibility of the breaking up of the marriage. In fact, maybe they should never have married, that seems to be one of the possible lessons of the movie.I am convinced that there are many different interpretations and opinions, and that 'Marriage Story' is currently being discussed in many families, circles of friends, social networks. One of the merits of the film is that the situation presented on screen and the rich and complex characters of the two main heroes open the appetite for such discussions. The acting performance of the two is exceptional. Scarlett Johansson plays one of the best roles of her career - she is assertive and vulnerable, ambitious and skeptical of doubts, a devoted but catchy mother, and an actress who does not give up her dream of success and achievement on screen. I know Adam Driver less, I have seen him in 'Star Wars', here he shows that he can play excellent and earthly roles. Some sequences suffer from excessive verbosity, but the actors manage to execute them with great vigor. I saw with great pleasure also Laura Dern and Ray Liotta, in the roles of lawyers of both parties, secondary but also key roles in the development of the story, both acting with aplomb and with a well-dosed sarcastic criticism. I was less excited about the insertion of the musical sequences towards the end, they do not fit well with the rest of the movie, they are too little for a musical and useless for a family drama. Despite less successful parts and ideas, 'Marriage Story' - which might have been called 'Divorce Story' as well - manages to captivate because of the topic and of the remarkable acting performances.",

            "content": "The movie the attorneys didn't want to be made.In which a loving but separating couple (played by Adam Driver and Scarlett Johansson) blow any possibility of a harmonious separation by bringing in their legal aides.It's a sad old movie in which the couple's divorce seesaws from still best friends to raging monsters. Their natural inclination seems to favour behaviour at the friendlier end of the spectrum, but by employing teams of attorneys (at great cost), whose only interests are fiscal and competitive, any of the harmony that remains between Driver and Johansson is cruelly exposed and used as a weakness.In the hands of a director less skilled than Noah Baumbach (Margot at the Wedding, Frances Ha) we could easily have ended up with either a black comedy or an overwrought drama, but this finds a line between the two, by steering a complex and subtle, and lengthy, dialogue (he is the writer) that does not allow the viewer to particularly side with either protagonist - both have their faults and their virtues - but it's the actions of their attorneys that bring out the worst, not the best, in them.That said my wife and I both fell for Driver's side of the story (and only found out afterwards that the movie is based on BaunBach's own experience of divorcing Jennifer Jason Leigh, so maybe it's not quite as agnostic as we thought.It's a slow build, with several long monologues that just finish, mostly, before they outstay their welcomes.But there are also moments of humour. The visit of a social worker is laugh out loud funny and the rehearsal scene where Johansson prepares her terrified sister to hand over the divorce papers is likewise an absolute comic joy.But overall it's both deeply personal and very affecting at times, more than once I was reaching for the Kleenex, and part of that is down to the casting and the highly personal cinematography that shows off the two leads at their most naked (emotionally) and vulnerable with long, lingering close ups on each of them. That's one reason that the big screen is always better than the TV for feature films. Like The Irishman, though, this is a Netflix original and will not be on the big screen for long.Driver is at the top of his game and that means there are three serious Oscar best actor contenders this year - himself, De Niro and Phoenix. All three would win in any average year. Driver's one take performance of Stephen Sondheim's \"Being Alive\" at a piano bar is a real highlight and is about a man';s lack of commitment. It's an excellent counterpoint to Randy Newman's typically accomplished, and in parts quite jaunty, score.Johannson puts in a career-best shift. Not only is his beauty put to one side . No make up and often unflattering close ups, but she acts her socks off.Also of great note is laura Dern's performance as her lawyer and a cameo role for a sprightly, 83 year old, Alan Alda.It's a slow burn but it comes highly recommended from me (and my wife). Just go see it in the cinema.",

And thanks to the excellent performances by Adam Driver and Scarlett Johansson these emotions are able to touch the heart of the viewer with all their power and at the same time with a delicate taste. As far as the theme of the divorce the movie is a critic about the process of it, on how it makes the couple waste a lot of money but most importantly on the hate it creates. Indeed the protagonists starts the process with all the good intentions to split up peacefully but when the lawyers kicks in they found themselves in a fight they don't even want. And another aspect \"Marriage Story\" manages to get right is that both Charlie and Nicole had their faults and they also had been disrespected in different ways and so the movie conveys the idea that in these situations usually (not everytime) the blame is on both, maybe not equally but everyone had his faults.\n\"Marriage Story\" is a great movie, with excellent acting, a touching screenplay, an immersive direction and a delicate score: check this one out!",

It is lacking some of the nasty MRA/Manospherean subtext that can crop up in films like this, i.e. Kramer Vs Kramer. Best of all the film has nice running sense of dry humor that really helps sell this as an authentic story. The film isn't even a dramedy but there is enough of a comedic energy present to make the tragic elements hurt all the more. The script is a tight piece of writing that is clearly been informed by lived experience.The cast is quite good. Driver turns in one of his best performances. There is a entitled edge to his performance that rings genuine for the character he is playing. Johansson gives a tour de force of tenderness, anger and inner strength. She can be quite a good actress when given the proper material to work with. It was nice seeing Alda again in a role of the voice of wisdom.The film's visuals and direction do not stand out in anyway.

A stand out scene is an argument where Johansson and Driver tear strips off one another with an uncomfortable viciousness. This film never loses its sense of humour and absurdity.

            "content": "Although this is not Noah Baumbach's first dive into the divorce theme (The Squid and the Whale, 2005), Marriage Story has to be his personal masterpieceMarriage Story shows how a recently separated couple deal with their divorce. We see actress Nicole (Scarlett Johansson) and theatre director Charlie (Adam Driver) try to make sense of what is next for them, why the relationship failed and how their lives will change going forward. All this whilst fighting over where their son should live in an uglier-tan-expected divorce proceedingThe reason the movie involves the viewer so much is because of how real it all feels. This I can only assume is due to an outstanding script. And of course top notch actors.\nBut the script is so refreshing - there is an argument between the couple that lasts easily for 10 minutes. A whole scene where, much like in everyday life, the argument continues to escalate and go off in tangents which have absolutely nothing to do with the original discord. That scene and Nicole's quasi-monologue at her lawyer's office really stuck with me.If you like down to earth movies about true relationship in the mundane world, that Marriage Story cannot be missed.Netflix put out a title that I sincerely hope makes it to the nominees for Best Movie, it's just outstanding",

            "content": "From the director of The Squid & the Whale, Frances Ha & Mistress America comes a love story told through the lens of a divorce. Marriage Story finds Noah Baumbach taking inspirations from his own life and pouring details of the separation process he himself went through into the script, and the result is a very personal, evocative tale.The film captures the awful, ugly, messy & emotionally devastating side of marriage dissolution with utmost sincerity. Baumbach's script is as impressive as his direction and his own personal connection to the material allows him to be aware of where to draw the line and not get carried away, thus keeping things grounded & authentic at all times.Helping the writer-director translate his story from script to screen are Adam Driver & Scarlett Johansson, both bringing their fragmented characters to life with fervour in what's arguably the finest performances in the careers of both. Packing a strong emotional wallop, their renditions unfold like emotions steadily rising to the surface until it finally explodes.Laura Dern also manages to stand out with a smashing input, and steals almost all her scenes while that annoying kid gives the audience a reason why they shouldn't have one in the first place. The plot structure & execution resembles a theatre play, camerawork is fluid, employing long takes & close-ups in ways that only pulls us in. And thanks to smooth editing, the narrative flow remains streamlined.On an overall scale, Marriage Story finds Noah Baumbach delivering on every front, and ranks amongst his best directorial efforts. What strikes out most about his latest work is that he captures the mundanity with same zeal as the story's vital segments, and addresses the themes of loneliness, heartbreak, agony, frustration & regret with an understanding, compassionate eye. One of the finest films of the year & certainly amongst the best in Netflix canon, Marriage Story comes strongly recommended.",

You really see this couple's relationship deteriorate as the film progresses on. What I love is how they show the effect that a divorce can have on children. The mother, in this case, plays the role of a \"Sunday Father\" and buys the kid into preferring to be with her than his father. Yet you see how the little boy becomes less and less happy. It's so sad.Both parents are imperfect but you really feel more for the father at the end of this than the mother. Maybe it's to do with Adam Driver's heartfelt performance, but I was left feeling so bad for him. You see how he holds on to the hope that she's still the same woman he fell in love with or that maybe their relationship will be healed, but you see how all that hope dies off as the divorce procedures get nastier and nastier. Scar Jo does a fantastic job in her role too. You see her frustration and indecisiveness so clearly. Her character really seems to act out of spite, especially after hiring that cruel LA lawyer. Laura Dern does an amazing job playing this horrid lawyer with the fake smile, I absolutely hated this woman the whole movie - that's how you know the actress played the part perfectly.Every direction that was taken to tell this story was chosen so perfectly. The score, the dialogue, I'm just in love with this film. It felt like I was watching a play being performed on stage. That scene where they're in court before the judge and the lawyers are saying these horrid things about both and you see how both of them are so hurt by what's being said cos neither one truly felt or believed what their respective lawyers were saying. It's a scene that just breaks your heart and come to terms with the horrid reality of divorce and disillusioned marriages. Adam Driver though, he deserves an Oscar nod. I kid you not, this man just delivered with this role.Highly recommend this film and congrats to the cast & crew on creating such a wonderful film.",

            "content": "The movie is called \"Marriage Story\" because it's a more appealing title than Divorce Story. But that's what the move is: the story of a divorce.In the opening scene, the two leads, Nicole (Scarlett Johansson, at the top of her game) and Charlie (Adam Driver, likewise) read from their lists of things they love about each other as we see beautifully spliced together examples matching the words. It's a charming, funny, and heartwarming open, and it in no way resembles the anger, frustration, and occasional vitriol these characters will spew at each other over the next two hours of the movie.It turns out the letters were written after a suggestion made by the couple's mediator. He explains that he likes to begin with a positive note because of the harsh negativity that soon will follow. Oh how right he is.The couple continues to reassure each other and themselves that they want to remain friends and keep this breakup amicable. They have no need for lawyers until they do. That's when the situation becomes volcanically contentious.The lawyers know how the divorce game works, and they're hall of fame-level players. They gather all possible ammunition from the party they represent, then they hurl them at the other soon-to-be ex-spouse like a box full of live grenades. It's brutal to watch. Clever framing from director Noah Baumbach displays the discomfort and pain this causes each spouse to see their significant other lambasted mercilessly in court. Neither of them wanted things to go this way.As gut-wrenching as many scenes can be, laugh-out-loud humor slips its way into just as many moments. Give credit to Baumbach's writing as much as his stellar directing. Surrounding all scenes, both crushingly sad and delightfully funny, is unceasing truth and fairness. Neither Nicole nor Charlie is made out to be the villain. They are both presented as fallible characters who are good people who happen to be dealing with one of the most challenging situations human beings can face. Divorce can bring out the worst in people and it does here. Which is what makes it such a miracle that Baumbach manages to keep both lead characters so empathetic. Baumbach's work is award-worthy in both the writing and directing departments, as is the acting of the two leads.Netflix has been searching for a best picture winner for a few years now, and it looks like it might finally happen. \"Marriage Story\" is not only one the best movies of the year; it's one of the best of the last several years (and if this movie doesn't win, Netflix also boasts \"The Irishman.\")I'm sure \"The Irishman\" is fine, but I can't say for sure yet because I'm still too intimidated by that three and a half hours runtime. But I saw \"Marriage Story\" and it was incredible. It's as good a movie as you'll see all year, in the theater or at home on Netflix.",

            "content": "I think the first film I remember crying at was Kramer v Kramer; I don't know how old I was, but I remember being in the same room as it when the TV was showing it one Christmas. I don't think I fully understood it - but I know what stayed with me so powerfully was the way I sensed it articulating something of my own fear of my own parents splitting up. Not that I ever had any reason to think that would happen - it didn't. But I remember the fear.Many years and 20 years of my own marriage later, Marriage Story doesn't evoke the same fear, but it does evoke both a kind of sadness as to the way it portrays what so many go through, a kind of recognition of the sort of slow escalations that all of us experience in almost any sort of relationship. It's the simple - yet complex - story of a couple's marriage in breakdown ... they start in couple's counselling and ends in divorce, following the negotiation of the details along the way.It seems odd to cast the film among the performance industry - he is a theatre director, she an actress; at times that's in danger of tipping the film into the sort of conflicts most of us don't have to deal with, but in the end there's enough truth there to make this feel like an 'everyman' sort of relationship.The whole film hints occasionally at the heightened realities of musicals - the framing, the tight close-ups and tracking shots following the long speeches of one or the other, maybe even the colour palette at times suggesting the 1950s/60s musicals golden era. When Adam Driver's character, near the film's end, sings a Sondheim song in a bar, that sense is bought closer to the heart; like musicals, the film is unashamed in trying to move us and does so.Much of this is quite remarkable - Adam Driver and Scarlett Johansson are outstanding, both of them simultaneously sympathetic and repellant, highlighting the reality that the film doesn't force us to choose one side or the other; or if it does, the way we jump is down to our own biased, not the film's. The film's standout moment, an argument that starts amicably and ends in words that can't be unsaid, is the sort of sequence you feel as if you're privy to someone else's private pain, laundry that should only aired in private hung out for all to see. It's remarkable in performance, direction and writing - and everything else besides.The film also mines comedy out of some of the most painful situations; the moment Adam Driver's character is served with divorce papers is almost farce-like in its execution, yet the tonal shift within the scene never jars. Much within the film is funny, because people are funny; there's always a hint of joy, even in the midst of great pain.This, I think, is where the hope in the film comes from; given where we are almost certain the film will end right from the first scene, the light touches of humour and the moments of clarity amidst the recriminations, claims and counterclaims point us to the human capacity to be better versions of ourselves even when so much seems to be falling around us. Like the best films, it's never one thing entirely - it's a love story about a divorce, a drama with very good jokes and comedic scenes, a musical with only one song. It's a film about one particular relationship, that allows us to see every relationship (not just marital ones) in a fresh light.",

That was not the case in this movie at all. I found myself constantly siding with Charlie. His wife who lied, manipulated and tried to bankrupt him goes between confused to pure villainy. And when Charlie after quite a long time eventually fires back to keep his child she acts shocked and hurt. When she has dragged him through hell and back while constantly lying about wanting to do things without lawyers or that it's just a formality. But even if you, as I do pick one side.

There is also a strong supporting cast, including Julie Hagerty as Johansson's mother, Laura Dern and Ray Liotta who both give witty performances as the jousting divorce attorneys on opposites sides.The film's emotional labyrinth is gradually negotiated by the two leads and includes a pained, stately soundtrack that hits all the right notes. Another plus is the film's lush cinematography that gives an unhappy story a surprisingly sunny aura. Even though we are watching two people during the worst period in their lives, the world around them seems comforting and warm.Usually, Baumbach's filmmaking style can be very blunt, sometimes even downright tactless. But here, his signature tone feels right at home as he portrays the frustration, heartbreak and fury that is the battle of wills of two people struggling to reach one another. It's not always easy to watch but it will leave a mark. As tough as this is to digest, it's still a work of excellence. Strongly recommended.",

Driver and Johansson were fully deserving of their Oscar nominations, both putting in some of their best performances. I felt every emotion alongside the pair of them, finding the pain and anger that each of them expressed to be so incredibly real and believable. Alongside these two powerhouse performances comes a superb supporting cast, particularly Nicole's family who provided some delightful comic relief.This comedic element is another triumph of the film. It escaped being a very sombre film through its clever and subtle comedy, which added another layer to the film and further highlights the talent of Driver and Johansson in creating such light and dark in their work.What also struck me about Marriage Story were the constant close camera angles which delivered a connection to the characters and enhanced the intimate feel of the experience. This really drew me in and, alongside the solid script and outstanding performances, made me connected to the film and engaged in a way I hadn't anticipated.Everything about Marriage Story felt so real.

Another standout is that musical number, with words almost as tragic as its performance, a solemn attemp by Adam Driver, whom has found his niche in demanding dramatic roles that require passion and strong intensity.Scarlett Johannson gives a firm portrayal of a woman, wife and actress who lives by the shadow of his theatre director husband, drawing an accurate sense of an overlooked woman, whom despite being successful professionally, is still heavily damaged by a loveless marriage.Marriage Story is not all about the performances, it feels like a real, authentic story, with a true and honest ending, which most of the times it is much more valuable than an happy one.",

The acting is without a doubt some of the best that I have seen, and I believe that both Adam Driver and Scarlett Johansson deserve Oscar nominations for how well they did in the film. Unfortunately, I personally was not all that affected by their emotional performances, and had a lot of trouble connecting with their characters. I think older audiences, as well as anyone who has been through a divorce will connect with the film a lot more than I did. That was really my big problem with the film, apart from their child being extremely annoying at times. Other than that, the film is very well made, I did not get bored at any point, although I think it could have been 10 minutes shorter. If it were not for the fact that I felt no attachment to the characters, I would likely give this film a much higher review, likely an 8 or a 9, but I just really wasn't feeling it.

            "content": "Even before Noah Baumbach showed us the article with Nicole and Charlie titled \"Scenes from a Marriage\", the movie screamed of influences to Bergman to me. The main characters are a theater director and an actress (like in After the Rehearsal). There are shots that evoke Persona. And the basic story feels like stuff that happens between episode 3 and 4 of the Swedish television series. The actual divorce in Bergman's film is largely glossed over, skipping from the admission of infidelity to the final fight that leads to signing of the divorce papers, but it's the sole focus of Baumbach's film. Aside from all the Bergman influences, though, this is a very good film.The movie uses a framing device that works incredibly well. The first ten minutes of the movie are two letters written by each of the main characters that details how they love the other, however they were written at the behest of a mediator for their divorce, trying to establish a ground floor of emotional contrast from their current situation. The problem is that the letters never get read. Nicole hates what she wrote, but Charlie is open to reading it. Yet Nicole barges out of the office before anything can be read, her rage at the very exercise.She has good reason to be angry, having discovered that Charlie had a brief affair recently while he was also unhelpful in moving them from New York to Los Angeles where she wanted to get into television work. He, though, almost single-handedly made her a serious actress after bringing her onto his theater troupe after her one big credit of \"girl who takes her top off\" in a teen sex comedy, while she also hasn't had sex with him in a year. Let's just say, the situation is really messy.The mediator was their effort to settle the divorce without lawyers, but everything goes sideways when Nicole moves her and their son to Los Angeles and she hires a high-priced divorce attorney. Suddenly even the question of whether the family is based on New York or Los Angeles comes into question, a turn of events that Charlie simply can't believe. He's behind the ball, trying to play catchup on California divorce law and get a lawyer while suddenly needing to establish a residence in Los Angeles.The process is the punishment in this film, and both Nicole and Charlie get punished (with heavy implications that this is the fault of the lawyers). They end up dragging each other through the mud with the central point being custody of their son. Charlie is shocked at how easily Henry adapts to his new life in Los Angeles while expressing nothing but disdain for his former life in New York. Charlie does everything he can to try and reconnect with the child he suddenly finds that he's on the verge of losing, all to little avail.The movie is at its absolute height, though, when Nicole and Charlie fight. There's so much hidden anger within the relationship that comes out in that famous fight where Charlie beats a hole in the wall. The scene really hinges on the acting talents of Black Widow and Kylo Ren, and both Scarlett Johannson and Adam Driver rise to the occasion, delivering blistering performances of pure unadulterated rage. It's a marvel to behold.The messiness of life ends up sorting itself out and a truce of a sort ends up falling into place. It's a messy end to a messy story, but the journey is harrowing and sad. The ending of the framework comes when Charlie finds Nicole's letter from the beginning of the film. These were two people who did love each other, who got a lot from each other in their relationship, and who not only decided to split but who also let their acrimony against the other determine the course of the divorce, damaging both of them in the process. The portrait is incredibly compelling and a wonderful look into an ugly process that never seems to have a winner.",

But, seriously though, Marriage Story is one of the most personal and emotional films I have ever seen, driven by solid direction and a great script, but mostly by two powerhouse, really outstanding performances by Adam Driver and Scarlett Johnson. It's a very simple premise, it's a movie about a family going through a divorce. But it's executed extremely well, to the point that I swear I even forgot I was watching a movie. During the scene where Scarlett Johannson's character is explaining to Laura Dern, who is also awesome in her role by the way, why she wants the divorce, that part of my brain that always wants to analyze movies, was gone and got to the point where I was just watching, not even Scarlett Johannson, but a heartbroken woman explain why she wants to go through with the separation. It's great. And it's done in a very tasteful way to give us both perspectives, we get to see what Adam Driver is going through and also what she's going through, so we get to understand both sides. It's not like one is the bad guy and one is the good guy, it's never like that. I loved this movie, it brought one or two tears to my eye, outstanding performances like I said and would highly recommend.",

Starring Adam Driver, Scarlett Johansson, Laura Dern, Azhy Robertson, Alan Alda, Ray Liotta, Julie Hagerty, Merritt Wever, Brooke Bloom, Wallace Shawn. (R)More accurately, \"Divorce Story\" (or at the very least, \"Marriage Autopsy\"); shows the detailed--and sometimes agonizing--process of spouses (Driver, Johansson) separating while struggling to remain on reasonable terms and share custody with their child (Robertson). Incisive and bitter yet deeply humane and ultimately compassionate, writer/director Baumbach has created a stirring, sharply-crafted examination of irreconcilable differences, the toll of wreckage and the shared hurt, where blame is felt, weaponized, and ultimately beclouded. It's an imperfect creation, to be sure, with certain scenes and moments that veer off course (the \"knife trick,\" lawyer Dern's speech while prepping her client for court questioning, etc.), but there are plenty more sequences of raw honesty, understated power, and relatable discomfort that ring true. Driver and Johansson both give bravura performances, as good as they've ever been before, and it's a testament to the angles they choose and the confidence in the characters they portray that neither one can (or would) claim any kind of \"victory,\" Pyrrhic or otherwise, once the smoke finally clears.86/100",

            "content": "It's wonderful to see a filmmaker like Noah Baumbach (The Squid and the Whale, Greenberg) tackle a simple, basic subject and elevate it to greater heights. He has displayed the ability to convert a raw, realistic marriage-divorce saga into something so deep, mature, hard-hitting, and engaging. The brilliant writing (by the director himself) is backed by exemplary performances from its entire ensemble. Marriage Story did remind me of Asghar Farhadi's A Separation at certain points, but it's a film that's wholly American in its texture, its perspectives.Adam Driver (as theater director Charlie) and Scarlett Johansson (as theater artist Nicole) are both stunning in their own right. They make their characters appear extremely grounded and believable and it gives us the feel of watching the divorce proceedings of a couple that we have seen and known very well. While the core theme of a couple going through a divorce may not seem like fresh material for feel-good cinema, Baumbach actually makes it look earnest. The film opens with the two of them reading out (in their minds) what they love about each other only for the viewer to realize that they're sitting in front of a mediator.It's a solid hook for an opening scene. You're immediately drawn to the lives of Charlie and Nicole. You want to know what drove them to the point of separation when they just spent ten minutes talking in length about each other's strengths and adorable qualities. Baumbach takes the rom-com route to tell his story but in a strictly sensible fashion. The exes want to keep things friendly for their son Henry, but they soon realize that they're drifting away from each other. The lawyers of the splitting couple, Nora (Nicole's lawyer; a splendid Laura Dern), Jay (Charlie's first lawyer; a pointy Ray Liotta), and Bert (Charlie's second lawyer; a calmer Alan Alda) keep adding further layers to this increasingly hostile wedge.The dialogues score brownie points. They're razor-sharp, filled with sarcasm and double entendre, and delivered with potency by each member of the ensemble cast. It also goes on to show the intensity of love, relatability, and understanding between husband and wife who slipped up in their personal lives while tending to their careers. Baumbach makes it clear that the institution of marriage lies in its basics: the prolonged eye-contact, the haircuts, the tying of the shoelaces, the making of breakfasts, the monopoly sessions, and more along those lines.And oh, not to forget, there's a fair bit of comedy too, the kind you wouldn't expect in a film such as this. I love the way Charlie reacts to multiple people telling him L.A's got 'more space'. I also love the way Nicole's mom and sister prepare themselves to present the divorce petition to Charlie, just the way scene rehearsals (for theater or cinema) would look like. Marriage Story is incredible in the way it offers clarity to the arguments of both husband and wife before the decision is made. Its straightforwardness is incomparable.",

After Nicole takes their young son with her to Los Angeles to live with her mother, she begins divorce proceedings.In a five-year period beginning in the late 1970s, there were three exceptional domestic American dramas that won many hearts and numerous awards: \"Kramer vs. Kramer\" (1979), \"Ordinary People\" (1980), and \"Terms of Endearment\" (1983). \"Marriage Story\" has revived this genre (at least the part of it that wins much positive attention) and raises the bar.Director/writer Noah Baumbach has succeeded in making a divorce story that is sad, gripping, funny, and even somewhat of a thriller at times. There is so much to ponder in every scene whether it be subtle or harsh. And as it reflects modern life so accurately, its impact is stunning and lasts well after the film's conclusion.Baumbach is blessed with a superb cast especially in his leading players who each have a standout individual scene plus a dialogue scene that hits it out of the park.Near the beginning, Johansson is exceptional in a scene in which she summarizes her life situation to her lawyer. Near the end, Driver is extraordinary in a revealing scene in which he struggles to fight back tears. But each is at their best in a confrontation scene that lasts several minutes. That scene alone belongs on a special \"best of all time\" list and should be mandatory material for future acting students. It is at least equal to the renowned confrontation scene between Erland Josephson and Liv Ullmann in \"Scenes from a Marriage\" (1973).The film is also blessed with a great supporting cast. As Nicole's lawyer, Laura Dern is cleverly devious as someone who can barely conceal her shark teeth behind a seemingly smiling demeanor. As another family lawyer, Ray Liotta easily matches the Dern character's disregard for humanity. (The legal profession is ripped to shreds in this film.) On the lighter side, Julie Hagerty is funny as Nicole's flighty mother; so is Martha Kelly in a small role as a mousy court evaluator who must observe how each parent relates to their son.The power of \"Marriage Story\" could easily make it the best film of 2019; it could even be the best film of the decade. - dbamateurcriticRATING (out of four stars): * * * *OUTSTANDING ACHIEVEMENTS:Directing by Noah BaumbachScreenplay by Noah BaumbachActing by Adam Driver and Scarlett Johansson",

I felt so sorry for their young son Henry and hope his Dad got custody.The acting is good especially Laura Dean as Nora Fanshaw the self interested crass Hollywood divorce lawyer who encourages Nicole to go for broke and Ray Liotta as Jay Marotta the even more greedy New York lawyer Charlie ,who never wanted to go through court and nasty legal battles engages on his behalf when his wife decides the opposite.Another Netflix one month Cinema release the film had its world premiere at the Venice Film Festival on August 29 2019 and began a limited theatrical release on November 6 and exactly one month later December 6 (to qualify for Awards season) began digital streaming on Netflix to great critical acclaim but not from me .I much prefer a far better film on the subject of a marriage breakup the brilliant 1979 Kramer Vs. Kramer starring Dustin Hoffman and Meryl Streep it had style substance and two much more interesting characters than Marriage Story and told their story in 1hour and 45 minutes.",

The cast is stellar and Johansson gives probably the best performance of her career.

This is just every divorce/troubled marriage movie ever made: Kramer Vs. Kramer, The Possession, Scenes from a Marriage, like half of what Woody Allen does. More boring everyday banality, a movie heavily in debt to the aforementioned Bergman and Allen (Alan Alda, who starred in Allen's 'Crimes and Misdemeanors' appears here as a lawyer. Scarlett also appeared in two of his movies) but nowhere near as good, no matter how badly it wants to be. A lot of it is courtroom proceedings/lawyer meetings and talk talk talk that I frequently spaced out during. Of course there's the \"powerful! Gripping! oh so moving!\" argument scene like you've seen in all the aforementioned movies, and it doesn't really go anywhere at the end. I'm getting fed up with Noah Baumbach's mediocrity. He may be a fine writer, but a pretty unexciting director. He's trying too hard to be Woody Allen (his debut was the infuriatingly boring time-waste \"Francis Ha!\", which was very Manhattan-esque), but without the humor and nostalgic charm of Allen's early work.

I loved Noah Baumbach ever since I saw Frances Ha and this film isn't just my favourite film of his but also my favourite of the year so far.Marriage Story follows Charlie and Nicole, a couple going through a divorce and how the actual legal process of that divorce is affecting them.Noah Baumbach is an extremely talented filmmaker. I love his approach of making films about mundane life as there is so much that can be done from a character perspective. He possesses the ability to make characters feel real and create wonderful interactions between each of them. However, what he achieved with Marriage Story is stunning in every way.This is a film that really focuses on its characters and their thoughts and feelings. We really understand the pain and struggle both protagonists are going through as Baumbach allows us to spend alone time with both characters and hear their perspective on the situation. There are some truly heartbreaking scenes that may be hard to watch and none of that would have been achieved without the brilliance of Baumbach's screenplay and magnificent acting from Johansson and Driver.I don't think words can justify how phenomenal the acting is. This is Adam Driver's best performance yet. He deserves a lot of awards and merit for his work here. You can tell his character is breaking down inside as Driver packs a lot of emotion into each scene. This is also the best I ever saw Scarlett Johansson. There is a scene where she explains why she's getting a divorce and that scene is so moving due to the amount of emotion Johansson expresses whilst reciting the dialogue. The most distressing scene is when both of them argue and it contains some of the best acting I've ever seen in a film. Laura Dern and Ray Liotta also create a great amount of impact in every scene they're in.Baumbach's script is one of, if not, the best script of the year. Each dialogue and conversation between characters feel extremely real and bring a sense of authenticity to what's taking place. It also sheds light on the nature of each character so we, as an audience, learn how everyone behaves. Apart from the characters, this film also focuses on the legal process of the divorce as well and how it can worsen the phase the couple are going through. Baumbach's direction is also fantastic. He uses a lot of long takes which effectively brings out the emotional punch that deeply affects the people watching.Hats off to Noah Baumbach, Scarlett Johansson, Adam Driver and everyone who worked on this film. Marriage Story is a masterclass in terms of its characters, script and acting. This is definitely going to take all the awards home which won't bother me at the slightest because Marriage Story deserves all of them.",

The divorce appears to be mostly motivated by their differing professional aspirations. No matter how justified these may have been, in my moral judgment they should have been secondary to providing a stable home for their child. Perhaps the saddest aspect of our modern society is that many of us fail to realize that life is best experienced by subjugating our own needs to those around us, most particularly within our immediate family and even more particularly to our minor children. This form of narcissism seems more prevalent in show business where successful careers depend on self promotion and that may explain why people in that occupation appear to divorce at a higher rate.2) Our legal system exacerbates the divorce experience for those who have assetsIn most cases at the time that the decision to divorce is made, the ensuing pain is underestimated by the couple. Rather than the anticipated experience of freedom and removal of a burden, the loss of companionship causes considerable pain and grief which is most often redirected as anger toward the other spouse. If the couple have assets and hire attorneys, it is in the financial interest of the legal professionals who are billing hourly to take advantage of this acrimony. Many family law lawyers are like the Alan Alda character in the film and do their best to address the emotional needs of their clients despite this financial reality but there are others who do not. Too often divorces cause huge financial pain for both parties.",

My favourite romantic dramas tend to be ones where things don't work out (e.g. 500 Days of Summer, In The Mood For Love, the marriage-breakdown story in Love Actually) as they make for much more original and interesting stories than your usual trite happily-ever-after stuff.Initially Marriage Story is quite disappointing though. It moves at a snail's pace and nothing really happens until about 40 minutes in. Viewer patience is rewarded though as things do get much better eventually. Once the parasitic lawyers get involved the plot becomes much more interesting and the pace speeds up as the situation spirals out of control. It also demonstrates that divorce only ever benefits the lawyers.These plot developments do also take the movie into unoriginal territory, as Kramer vs Kramer already covered the trauma, trials and tribulations of a divorce, and did it better, covering it more intensely and engagingly.As the movie goes on it becomes more profound and engaging and the ending is very powerful and emotional. The performances of Adam Driver and Scarlett Johansson also help drive this quality, especially towards the end when their relationship is at its nadir. The confrontational scene between them near the end is superb.A tighter first Act and this would have been a much more engaging and compelling drama.",

The story itself lets just say nothing original or new, but hey, that is a movie about life. About marriage and divorce.

She was nothing short of amazing in here - some monologs that lasted about 10 min. where she goes trough all possible emotions is the best acting I have seen this year. Adam Driver was very good and he should get a nomination.Overall, \"Marriage Story\" is a very solidly written and directed movie, with some stellar performances. I see here two or three Oscar nominations worthy performances, and a locked win by Johansson.",

            "review_title": "Scenes From a Broken Marriage ...",
            "content": "40 years after \"Kramer vs. Kramer\", here comes Noah Baumbach's \"Marriage Story\", a well-written, well-directed and certainly well-acted movie tackling the difficult subject of divorce and through it marriage, responsibility... and love. That the film is a major Oscar contender doesn't surprise me but I like what that critical acclaim reflects: a movie about divorce must obey to higher standards of filmmaking than any drama subgenre; many are masterpieces such as Farhadi's \"Separation\" or Bergman's \"Scenes from a Marriage\".The point of a divorce film isn't to take sides, you've got to show two persons with their strengths, flaws, the qualities they take for granted and weaknesses they don't suspect. The three-dimensionality you bring up to the characters and the way they interact through conflicts, tenderness or awkward moments have the challenging complexity of an emotional Rubik-cube game. A quote in \"Marriage Story\" says \"crime lawyers see bad people at their best, divorce lawyers see good people at their worst\" and that's the point: marriage movies insist on flaws that are only flipsides of qualities.And so the film starts beautifully with two monologues from each of Charlie (Adam Driver) and Nicole (Scarlet Johansson), describing what they like best in each other. The descriptions insist on so many details that it's impossible not to relate to both of them, I often brew tea I end up not drinking like Nicole and I'm a bad loser when it comes to games like Charlie. The opening monologues are exposition masterstrokes (with a twist at the end), allowing us to know about the couple, their roles as parents and their jobs: Charlie is a theater director who found a muse in Nicole, a previous TV star who abandoned her dreams for Charlie.Together they had a child named Henry (a reference to Justin Henry who played Billy in \"Kramer\"?), the kid played by Azhy Robertson, is obviously the sinews of the war. Since Charlie lives and works in New York and Nicole stars in a TV show shot in L.A., much more they married in L.A. and it's Henry's birthplace, there's more at stakes than a matter of custody. Charlie wants Henry back to New York but Nicole's rising career is in L.A.. The battle opens with promises never to go to court but we know it's a matter of inevitability. The trick is that no one wants to accuse the other of bad parenting, nor to brag about being the better parent, it's all about saying what's best for the kid.But can any parent be that objective when it comes to the child? Spending more time with his mother, Henry's bias leans in her direction while Charlie becomes the stranger who does his best to accommodate him. It takes someone who's gone through divorce to understand Charlie's situation. I see my own daughter twice every month during weekends and half the holidays, and whenever I see her I feel forced to satisfy her caprices, which is not the right way to educate, but since you're put in a situation where you want to live the moment to its fullest and not spoil it, you spoil your kid.And when the kid behaves badly, you almost take it as an affront... and must endure people who pretend not to judge your parenting and you know they do. That's the paradox of divorce, you try to display the best parenting and yet it might be perceived as the worst like in that sequence where Charlie is being observed and does his best to avoid complications... that ultimately happen. Divorce complicates relationships and I'm glad a film could show it so remarkably, with brutality or humor.I saw \"Kramer\" with my then-wife and she ended up (to my surprise) rooting with Ted while I kind of empathized with Joanna, especially her suffocation through marital commitment and wish to find herself. It's important not to make a conflict binary and this is why the \"character study\" is important, why we should understand someone's inner personalities. Charlie is an artist who's dedicated to his art in a disciplined manner, Nicole is a dreamer who needs to be her own master. Together they love each other but here's what I said about Bergman's \"Scenes from a Marriage\":\"While loving someone is a genuine feeling, being married implies duties whose applications might interfere with our inner personalities. Whether it's sex life, success and dreams, they can be undermined by marital life. The danger is to start looking at the man or the woman of our life as the one who's sinking it into the abysses of routine and conventions.\"That's how Nicole started to look at Charlie and vice versa, that's the way she describes him in a bravura speech where she tells her lawyer (a scene-stealing Laura Dern) how she feels about him, and a later moment where Charlie vents his anger on Nicole and culminates with a wish to see her die, before busting into tears. I love that he regained his composure and said \"sorry\" and that Nicole didn't even take it badly, it's for subtle moments like this that I think the film should take home a few golden boys. Driver has a raw natural magnetism and Johannson is given the most difficult role and both are perfect in acting naturally and also unnaturally. The best 'actors' being the lawyers.As someone who went through these stages of bargains through love letters, these moments where we cry ourselves to sleep, anger when we blame the other for failing the marriage vows and we realize we won't see our children regularly, when we even miss the in-laws, the film is poignantly cathartic even in a resigned state.And I mentioned the notion of \"acting\" in marriage, maybe the real act of fidelity in marriage is to be faithful to yourself in the first place. What Charlie and Nicole achieve at the end.",

            "content": "When I first saw the trailer for \"Marriage Story\", I was intrigued by the concept and cast. When it started gaining buzz and racking up award nominations in droves, I knew it was something I was going to see. While there were certain parts of the film I enjoyed very much, overall I found it slightly lacking in one key area: drawing real, visceral emotion out of the viewer.For a very basic overview, \"Marriage Story\" is a tale about Charlie (Adam Driver) and Nicole (Scarlett Johansson), a married couple in the beginning stages of separation/divorce. Not wanting to make things too messy for son Henry (Azhy Robertson), Charlie & Nicole want to keep things civil--until the lawyers get involved, drawing some passion out of the all sides.Easily the best part of this film for me was the acting from Driver and Johansson. They both give performances that are very much award-worthy and complement each other perfectly. At one point, Driver absolutely brings down the house with his rendition of \"Being Alive\", while Johansson is a wonder to watch slowly unfurl her emotions as the movie progresses. I'd have no problem with either of them taking home some hardware during awards season.The problem I had with this film, however, is that it seemed like every time it looked to be kicking into a high emotional gear, something would happen to stop that momentum in its tracks. The lawyers (played by Laura Dern, Alan Alda, & Ray Liotta) are the most egregious examples of this, as those scenes constituted easily my least favorite ones of the whole experience. They sort of turn the proceedings into \"Divorce Story\" rather than \"Marriage Story\", which throws things off track.To me, the best scenes in the movie are when Driver and Johansson simple co-exist on screen together. They might end up talking very calmly with each other at first, but then the escalation continues and by the end they are screaming in frustration/rage. These are the types of scenes that win awards. Like I said, it's too bad that momentum kept getting interrupted.For whatever reason, it just felt like this film was about a half-step \"off\" for me the whole way. Like all the ingredients were there for it to be really emotional, but rarely did they coalesce properly and actually do so. Like I said, the acting in the piece should be rewarded handsomely, but in terms of the film/plot as a whole, I can't quite put this one into my upper echelon.",

Everything about this film, the acting, the writing, the direction, all combine to create something quite masterful. Every hand this movie tries itself at it nails. Whether it is trying to be funny, heart-breaking or thought-provoking, it always gets it right. This is a really good movie.Scarlett Johansson, Adam Driver and Laura Dern have all been nominated for Academy Awards in their respective acting categories. They all gave masterful performances and deserve the genuine shot at winning they all have. Best Supporting Actress is always the weakest category and it typically tends to come down to who gets the most screen time, so I suspect Dern will take home the statue. The other two suffer from having very strong performances to compete against and so both may come up short. I would be happy to see either of them cause the upset though because they are excellent in this film.'Marriage Story' is told in a way which asks you to side with either the man or the woman. I would be very interested to poll people on this movie and see who they sided with and thought was being more reasonable. It's a tough one but I know I sided with Driver's character a lot more. Whether men tend to side with the man and women with the woman, or not, I'd be interested to know.The thing I was most shocked about was how funny the film was able to be. Sometimes it was just a random line that cracked me up, sometimes it was an entire scene. There is a scene between Driver and Martha Kelly that had me in stitches. 'Marriage Story' is unquestionably one of the best films of 2019 and is well deserving of its Best Picture nomination.",

            "content": "I used to go to parties that my parent's friends would throw when I was younger, and many happy memories were had when we would go in the summer time. Unfortunately though, all good things must come to an end as the people who would host the parties eventually got a divorce and thus the parties ended, and despite the fact that they weren't my parents, I felt like as if my parents were getting a divorce. I always felt empathy for my friends that I grew up with whose parents got divorced rather it be for one reason or another. I fortunately never had to suffer through a divorce, as my parents have been happily married for almost 30 years now with no intention of seperating, so I didn't know how I would react to this film.Marriage Story is a film that I would call an 'actor-driven movie.' Much like films such as Good Will Hunting, 12 Angry Men, or A Few Good Men, Marriage Story is a film that's reliant on the actors and their performances. Not many movies like Marriage Story are made anymore, where actors are just given room to explore what they can do and I think that Marriage Story joins the films that I mention above as one of the best actor-driven movies that I've ever seen. Adam Driver and Scarlett Johannson aren't even acting in this film, which might be the highest praise I could give. I felt the blur of emotions that Driver and Johannson convey throughout this movie and I felt like these were real people, not actors playing a role. It's simply some of the best acting I've ever seen from Driver and Johannson, the rest of the cast are also strong, with a motherly like performance coming from Laura Dern or a grandfatherly performance coming from ol' Hawkeye Pierce himself, Alan Alda. Another thing that I loved about this film is how it doesn't allow you to take sides, the film showcases both of the main character's virtues, as well as their flaws and you can feel the frustration that they feel towards each other, but also the love that they still have for each other, despite everything that's happened. If there's a motif for this film, it would be that it makes you feel...a lot.There's no such thing as the perfect film of course, but much to my surprise I only had two problems with this movie, one being the performance of Ray Liotta, who becomes a bit grating as the abrasive lawyer though, to the film's credit, I think that was the point, and a scene where Driver's character sings, and while Adam Driver surprisingly has some good voice chops, I felt that it didn't really service the film in any meaningful way.Luckily, the film wasn't the 2 hour and 16 minute depression fest that I initially thought it would be, Noah Baumbach shows skill in littering in some humor and light hearted moments to balance with the bittersweet, somber tone of the film. There's also Baumbach's masterful use of tension that illuminates most of the scenes that Driver and Johannson share, and not in a suspenseful way, but rather in this lurking, uncomfortable sort of tension that's just itching to get out. Another thing that I expected to see was fighting, and there wasn't much of that, except for two instances...just two. But then again, most of the film is carried by that sense of uncomfortable tension.Marriage Story is a film that deals with a number of difficult topics and emotions, but it is a film that deals with its themes and emotions with a sense of grace that makes me want to seek out more of Baumbach's work in the near future. It was simply wonderful, and you would do yourself a disservice if you don't see it.",

            "content": "I've been trying to come up with a way of reviewing this film in a way that doesn't seem like I personally directed it or something, because movies like Marriage Story don't come along very often and I just feel like gushing about how incredible is. Netflix has been releasing tons of quality content this year and this may very well be the best of their entire catalogue of feature films. Alone with Roma and their recent release of The Irishman, I believe you'll be seeing Marriage Story in contention for many, many awards in the coming months. Here's why I believe Marriage Story is a must-watch.Not all relationships work out and if every single Romance film ever made had a happy ending, then that would just be a lie. It's nice to see a movie tackle this subject matter and stick with it from start to finish. Marriage Story is a look into the lives of Charlie (Adam Driver) and Nicole (Scarlett Johansson) as they are clearly not able to keep a working marriage, but also don't want to ruin the family they have made. From gut-wrenching scenes of excessively honest dialogue and a conclusion that feels raw and true, this movie is one of the best dramas I've seen in years.Take your pick at who outshines who here, because it really is a toss-up as to who is more incredible between Driver and Johansson. It does help that writer/director Noah Baumbach gave them outstandingly good dialogue to work with, but the way these two play off each other is as if they were given a year to prepare for these roles and get to know each other. Everything about this film felt authentic, which made the overall impact so powerful. It's not easy to watch a movie about a love story that's about how marriage sometimes doesn't work out, but this movie does it in such a way that it doesn't feel depressing throughout the majority of the duration. This is all thanks to Noah Baumbach though.From Greenberg to While We're Young, Baumbach has been a director I've been keeping my eyes on, as I believe he has gotten better with each of his films, for the most part. It wasn't until The Meyerowitz Stories (New and Selected) that I really started to anticipate his next movie, but now I'll be desperately awaiting to get another story from him. His talent as a director, especially on Marriage Story, is truly something else. He is best suited for movies like Marriage Story or While We're Young, where it's all about the characters because he very clearly has a knack at getting the best possible performances out of his cast.Marriage Story begins strong, easing you into what will be a very emotional film and concludes in a way that feels natural. Overall, from these award-worthy performances, superb writing and directing, a very minimal score, which lets you sit with these characters for extended periods of time, it's very hard to nitpick this movie. There is one scene that made me chuckle, purely because I felt uncomfortable, but this movie is otherwise perfectly done. By the time 2019 ends, I feel that I may have to say this is the best movie of the year. I absolutely loved every minute of this movie. I can't recommend it enough.",

And yet, through the gloom and rising anxiety, Baumbach always preserves the heart of the moment, fleshing out the struggle of legal and emotional separation.The film stars Scarlett Johansson and Adam Driver. Laura Dern, Alan Alda, and Ray Liotta co-star.Johansson locates surprising areas of honesty for the character, working wonderfully with Baumbach's observant screenplay. Johansson plays an interesting foil, so long in the shadow of her high-profile husband despite being the face of his success in many ways. You can see the pain on her face, but it slowly turns defiant as she discovers a new life and a new (or perhaps rediscovered) sense of self in California. Her performance is Sublime.Driver has grown into one of the most respected actors of his generation a fearless and magnetic screen presence capable of making you believe everything he's saying no matter the context. He spends much of the film in a bemused haze as their divorce proceedings turn from civil to contentious, unable to understand how things went so sour despite his role in fracturing their relationship. It's the sort of skillful and soulful performance that's expected of him now, and he doesn't disappoint. Their chemistry is undeniable, and their performances sell the emotion of the script with ease.While Driver and Johansson take up most of the space in the room, there's still enough oxygen for some fun and quirky supporting turns, be it Wallace Shawn's unfathomably horny thespian or Merritt Wever and Julie Hagerty as Nicole's sister and mother, respectively. But it's Dern, decked out in slinky, aggressive power dresses and extreme heels, who effortlessly steals the movie away whenever she enters a scene. She has great fun sparring with Liotta and Alan Alda (as a grandfatherly and mostly inept lawyer who may not be up for the job. \"Marriage Story\" is all about its performances, and those performances are flawless in every sense of the term.\"Marriage Story\" manages to come out on the other side with a sense of calm and understanding, making an extraordinarily difficult viewing experience worth the pain to see how people can keep living even when life is determined to beat all the spirit out of you. The result is a near-perfect piece of transcendent art and one of the true standouts of 2019. 9.5/10",

How many actors go from adorable child stars to capable adult performers to among the greatest performers working?I had my reservations about \"Marriage Story\", though. I like Noah Baumbach. His movies are like antidotes to the wafer thin perfect protagonists you get in every other movie. However sometimes that can be a bit much. There is a layer of humour and irony that counterbalances the generally unlikable nature of the characters. But it seems a delicate balancing act. Is \"Marriage Story\" the movie where Baumbach finally falls to the net, and provides us a cringe-inducing story of unlikable characters doing hateful things?The answer is, as you've no doubt guessed, no. It is true that the characters do not endear you to them immediately. Cameos from Ray Liotta and Alan Alda (well into his eighties) come as stark relief from their selfish behaviour. But if anyone can turn this into a strength, Baumbach can. It's artful the way he makes us come around to his characters, letting us feel the push and pull of a divorce settlement, siding with one, then the other, and finally, endearing us to both of them, people who grew apart as they grew on you.\"Marriage Story\" is one of the year's best films, with a career best performance in front of the camera from Johansson and Driver, and a career best performance from Baumbach behind it.",

I was particularly invested in those scenes of almost mundane frustrations that don't rely on actors crying and screaming but the subtle hints of frustration.Adam Driver has quickly risen the ranks as one of my favourite actors and this is the role that he was born to play, there is a sequence of scenes in this film involving him having to deal with a series of events that Adam Driver plays brilliantly, so accurately reflecting that frustration of just wanting to get something over with. I was mesmerised and absolutely burrowed into that emotion that was not over the top, but real.I loved how this film portrays both sides of the argument and never paints one person as a bad person, as the audience we get to unravel how exactly they fell apart in their marriage but never once does it point fingers at one character nor paints them as bitter or hating each other. There is always a sense of hope in the details of the interactions between Charlie and Nicole that almost develops into a 'will they/won't they' situation; which was fascinating but I am glad that wasn't the direction they were taking, because realistically this isn't something that would happen. But it is the fact that despite them having a failed marriage these are still two people who care about each other and most importantly their child, and going through this strenuous and almost paradoxical circumstance of lawyering up and family court does not change that. It is these subtle moments that makes me absolutely adore Marriage Story.",

One thing I have not heard anyone else do is call this a horror movie... however, from my perspective, this is true existential horror (though, that is also what heavy drama is). A great quantity of it, if not all of it, is spiritually crushing to experience, especially knowing that all of this could happen to each and every one of us, and thus the movie is a phenomenal accomplishment. Wickedly performed by the 3 leads, namely Scarlet Johansson, Adam Driver, and the legendary Laura Dern. You hardly notice the film is 2 hours and 15 minutes as the writing is so locked-in, the acting is so organic, and it is directed and edited so well - everything runs smooth as a lazy river. It very much felt like this movie was born from somebody's very real experiences - a film that hits this hard generally only can be, and after doing some research, I see that it is in fact based on director Noah Baumbach's actual divorce (with Jennifer Jason Leigh of all people!??! I love her! Ahhh! She saw the movie and praises it - that speaks volume about her character IRL! Legend!).I haven't been attached to someone spiritually for about 3.5 years - lately I often desire something along those lines, but Marriage Story was one of the only things in a while that made me step back and think, wow, maybe I really am better off alone. After the emotional roller coaster that this film takes you on, Driver performs a song towards the end of the film, which within 20 seconds stood out to me beyond 99% of songs I have ever heard in my life - something about that song hit me hard. I knew there was a lot to it - turns out my instincts were right. I won't go into it here but you can add \"Being Alive\" to my favorite songs of all time list. There is a layer of dryness with a screaming soul beneath it that I have not witnessed in many other songs before - Driver gets it and delivers it in a context that somehow feels transcendent. This scene seals the deal and makes this movie legendary. It goes beyond a movie - it breaks a certain type of wall, not the 4th, maybe the 5th...it's a movie, but it's also biographical for multiple people, it's also an homage to a history of documented pain, it's also the human experience as a whole. The only reason I'm giving this a 9 out of 10 instead of a 10 out of 10 is because this isn't the kind of movie you want to watch over and over. It hurts too much.",

            "content": "GRADE: ATHIS FILM IS HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.IN BRIEF: A searing indictment about divorce that devastates in the subtlest of ways.\nJIM'S REVIEW: I openly wept at the conclusion of Noah Baumbach's deeply disturbing Marriage Story, a lacerating portrait of love lost. This highly personal account of divorce ranks among the best films of this or any year.Mr. Baumbach creates a story about two good but wounded people that is raw in its emotion and brutally honest in its treatment. There are so many small intimate moments throughout this gripping film with which one can easily identify to so many couples who lives suddenly take different paths. Such is the case of Nicole (Scarlett Johansson) and Charlie Barber (Adam Driver), two successful New York theater types who seem to be going through the paces of their marriage.The film begins brilliantly with voiceover narration and shared glimpses of happier times with the Barber family. We hear each of the couple's loving words about each character's positive traits, although Nicole is unwillingly to state her feelings aloud. Their marital troubles intensify when she decides to leave Charlie's theater company and moves to Los Angeles for an acting gig in a television pilot, taking their eight year old son, Henry (Azhy Robertson), with her while Charlie stays in New York to ready his Broadway directorial debut. Their bicoastal relationship quickly dissolves. Like so many well-intentioned couples, their aim is to split amicably, but they helplessly free-fall into a biased legal system that systematically destroy the lives of families already in pain.This is Mr. Baumbach's finest film to date. His resume is growing more and more impressive. His direction here is flawless and his screenplay is even more impressive in its well-played words and somewhat cruel actions. As screenwriter, he does stack the deck slightly against Nicole and her possible manipulation of their situation and allows Charlie to automatically become a tragic victim of circumstances. But that is a minor issue in Mr. Baumbach's concise and insightful storytelling. His tale of marriage and its flip side is mesmerizing. This all builds to a gut-wrenching confrontation scene between the warring couple that is the film's highlight (or perhaps lowlight just might be a better term). The overall effect of their marital loss ranks with some of the best films about divorce ever made. Family-based dramas like Ingmar Bergman's Scenes from a Marriage, Robert Benton's Kramer vs. Kramer, or Stanley Donan's Two for the Road come to mind.The ensemble is exceptional. Laura Dern plays Nora Farshaw, Nicole's barracuda of a divorce lawyer. Her performance is spot-on and she delivers a wild and cynical view of life, especially in her overt rant about motherhood that is simultaneously funny and very sad. Alan Alda and Ray Liotta skillfully depict two versions of L.A. divorce lawyers that show the inter trappings of the law system so perversely accurate. Julie Hagerty and Marritt Weaver play Nicole's mother and sister and they both offer solid support in their smaller roles. As the Barber's son, young Mr. Robertson delivers a natural and compelling performance as a confused and angry child caught in his parent's battle for control.But it is Ms. Johansson and Mr. Driver who ground the film with all their blistering pain and rage. Their acting is simply superb. In the more difficult role, Ms. Johansson portrays a woman thwarted by her life choices and yearning for more. At times, her character must be vulnerable or selfish and the actress is unafraid to show Nicole's uglier side. It is a fearless performance. Mr. Driver's Charlie goes through more of a metamorphosis and his arc is extremely moving. The actor shows his character's frustration, his insatiable need for self expression at the cost of wife's need for equality, and his ongoing inability to connect his feelings with her demands. He is outstanding. Both actors deliver their best performances in their already established careers which should be remembered this award season.Bad things do happen to good people and Marriage Story is that poignant love story worth retelling. This thought provoking film concludes full circle in two bittersweet scenes that reveal the cost of love and the tragedy of a failed marriage. Mr. Baumbach and company deserve all the accolades for their powerful cinematic statement. Marriage Story is one of the year's best dramas. By all means, go! And bring your tissues with you.",

She's 25 and the male lead is 40 in the 2009 film. Except Baumbach was married during that year of close work. Maybe knowing this helps illuminate aspects of this \"story\" that are totally absent in the 2019 film.When you are in the film business, as screenplay writer and gaining fame and power from a first couple of hit films, and you are getting a divorce about a year after \"meeting\" and working \"very closely\" with an actress who is much younger than you or your wife -- while your wife is pregnant -- and then divorcing your wife -- perhaps it is a good idea to write a film which that ignores those inconvenient facts. I guess. I mean if you got a typewriter why not whitewash what is transparently proffered as your story to make it about mutual alienation and not something more tawdry (and more typical behavior of men in Hollywood).But I'm sorry: as an audience member I don't want to be lied to. Therein lies the problem with Marriage Story. It was an opportunity to be honest yet it is a profoundly dishonest film. In fact it is deceptive narcissism of a very high order. Exploring the truth would have taken courage and would have been brilliant and real drama.Sure we all lie to ourselves, but frankly I don't want to hear, or watch others' lies about their marriagse. An unreliable narrator is one thing, it is a good plot device, but not when sold as a reliable one.OK on the positive side half of the acting, specifically by Johannson, is great.

Adam Driver kills as Charlie, but Scarlett Johansson destroys as Nicole. Their performances are as intertwined as they are fragmented, and they bounce off each other with effortless chemistry. Marriage Story is a powerhouse of craft on all fronts. It is completely arresting and intimate. Baumbach reminds us how delicate love is, and that - amidst all the chaos that comes with it - there can always be beauty even in despondency and heartbreak.Mitchell Bulfin",

Already I know this is going to be one of those movies I watch at least every 5 years or so ongoing probably til I die, though I don't plan on watching it again anytime soon (which is a testament to the emotional rollercoaster and how the movie opened up some of my still kind of fresh wounds so effectively).",

Noah Baumbach tells this story of divorce with a level of insight and grace that could only come from an intimate personal connection with the material. It's a profoundly empathic film that cares deeply for the flawed humanity of its characters, honest people who become incrementally entangled in a treacherous legal and emotional web. And despite the darkness of the subject matter, Baumbach, Johansson, and Driver are able to inject so many moments of tenderness, honesty, and raw emotion that the film manages to leave you with a sense of hope for its characters despite the seemingly hopeless situation.

I would like some parts to go a different way but at the end of the day, this is Noah Baumbach's story. He probably drew some inspiration from his real life and who am I to judge.

Unusually, it sounds good but not really that entertaining to last more than two hours.I was so wrong. This is one of the best movies of the year.

            "review_title": "Life in \"Marriage Story\"",
            "content": "Not so ironically, Writer and Director Noah Baumbach's \"Marriage Story\" is about divorce. Scarlett Johansson and Adam Driver play Nicole and Charlie Barber. They have a cute 8 year-old son Henry, played by resilient Azhy Robertson, who struggles with a learning disability.Charlie is the intense copious note taking Director of avant-garde theater in New York. Nicole is the former teen sex comedy movie star, who forsakes Hollywood stardom to act in her husband Charlie's theatrical stage productions.At the impasse in their marriage, Nicole accepts a TV series role in Los Angeles. She brings son Henry with her to Los Angeles, which is also home. Nicole lives with her Mom Sandra, played by whimsically wise Julie Hagerty, at her parents' home. Mom was the former Hollywood actress. Apparently, her late husband, Nicole's Father, was gay. Hence, that marriage also ended in divorce.On the other hand, Charlie grew up in the Midwest, raised by abusive alcoholic parents. So there's that. Although, Charlie occurs as rather anal retentive, controlling, he's a good kind man. Sandra loves him like a son. He's the good father. Perhaps, not the good husband. Apparently, he had an affair with his stage manager. Rather, Charlie might not be the good husband to Nicole.While in Los Angeles, Nicole hooks up with prominent divorce attorney Nora Fanshaw, played with charming ferocity by Laura Dern. Nora reassures Nicole, \"What you're doing is an act of hope.\" She seems to have genuine compassion for Nicole's suffering.Yet, clearly Nora has her own cause: \"The idea of a good father was only invented 30 years ago...\" Apparently, Nora has been deeply hurt from her own past marriage. So it's really not about Nicole. It's all about Nora. Just saying.As the movie opens, Charlie and Nicole work with their marriage Mediator. They're getting divorced. Each holds a letter that they wrote about what they love about the other. Director Noah brilliantly opens in flashbacks of Nicole and Charlie's life together, with Scarlett and Adam in narration. Clearly, Nicole and Adam love each other, are good parents, but perhaps, are no longer in love with each other.In the heart wrenching arc of \"Marriage Story\", Nicole tells Charlie that she no longer loves him, that she hates him, what he stands for. Angry Charlie screams, \"I want you dead!\" You see the sadness in Nicole's eyes. You witness the suffering in Charlie's eyes. I cried. Charlie literally drops to his knees.Yes, Charlie crossed the line. Yes, he was enraged. Yet, he occurred more wounded than angry. He was terrified that he lost the love of his life. That he lost Nicole. That's the profound humanity and brave vulnerability of Noah's \"Marriage Story\". No, Nicole and Charlie are not bad, people, who deserved what happened. Rather, life happened. Sometimes, life doesn't turn out the way we hoped, even with our best intentions. In this touching humanity Scarlett Johansson and Adam Driver are sublime.Early on, when talking with her attorney Nora, Scarlett's Nicole said that she \"got small\" with Charlie, that somehow her life got marginalized. Scarlett is so authentic, so courageous in her words and in her silence. Yes, she loves Charlie, but that hurts too much to continue to do so. Scarlett is awesome.Adam is simply amazing. He makes bold, compelling choices playing Charlie. Whether he flippantly comments on Nicole's haircut or when he struggles with the child car seat in his rental. Yeah, he's imperfect, and he tries so hard to do his best, to be right. Adam is profoundly vulnerable in Charlie's distinct humanity.In a scene with son Henry, Adam's Charlie remembers what made him fall madly and deeply in love with Scarlett's Nicole. There is beauty in imperfection, in their failed marriage. Life goes on. Yet, love is still the possibility. That's the power and poignancy of \"Marriage Story\". It's my very favorite movie of the year. Just saying.",

What is it with Americans and lawyers? Anyway, neither Johansson or Driver are cold here, the world around them is, caricatured even, infectious negativity, but they are the warm, sincere, beating heart of this really sad film.

I should not be all that surprised that Noah Baumbach could deliver a good story like this one, after all he has built on past work and I think he will have an impossible time topping this one, as break-ups go.Adam Driver, as a result of this movie and the earlier 2019 \"The Report\", is officially on my 'A\" list, the one that means future movies of his will automatically go on my 'to watch' list.

Marriage Story is a flawless, heartbreaking story led by two of some of the best performances of the year. Adam Driver is phenomenal. Most people know him from the new Star Wars Trilogy but people should really see some of his other films. He usually does a great job but in this film, he is 100% dedicated to the role. They are certain scenes in the film where it doesn't feel like he is acting. It feels as if he is actually this character and going through all of these troubles. He puts so much emotion into his performance that it is heartbreaking yet mesmerizing. Scarlett Johansson gives yet again another fantastic performance. While her performance isn't as mesmerizing as Driver's performance, it's still perfect. She also conveys a huge amount of emotion with her role but adds a slightly more comedic and relaxed atmosphere to Driver's serious and hardworking atmosphere. Both actors play off each other perfectly, even in scenes where their characters are fighting with each other. Every other performance in the film is pretty great, especially from Laura Dern. The script for Marriage Story is fantastic. It compliments the performances and feels very natural. It knows how much the characters need to say to get a point across or when to restrict them. The music and cinematography are great. The music is done by Randy Newman (Toy Story) and fits the depressing tone the film is going for. The film makes the good choice of not using music during certain dramatic scenes which helps make those scenes more emotional. The cinematography isn't groundbreaking by any means but there are a lot of beautiful shots. Towards the beginning of the movie, there is a 5 minute uncut shot of Scarlett Johansson talking about why she stopped being in love with Adam Driver's character and it's great. There is one sequence in the film that is perfectly shot, acted, and scripted and it's the argument scene. I felt sad and a smidge emotional for the characters throughout the film but this one scene made me feel a whole lot. It's one of the best scenes in cinema this year. Adam Driver and Scarlett Johansson completely disappear in this scene. It doesn't feel like acting. It feels like the filmmakers just filmed real people breaking apart. The emotion displayed in this one scene is off the charts. It cemented for me that Adam Driver is a masterclass actor that people should pay more attention to besides being known as \"the guy from Star Wars\". The rest of the film has its emotional moments but they don't top that scene. The film's plot is pretty straightforward but the way the characters interact makes the film feel unpredictable. Noah Baumbach used his direction to make a straightforward story feel unique. I'm going to start paying more attention to Baumbach from here on out. Overall, Marriage Story is a fantastic film about relationships and divorce with some of the best performances of the year, an outstanding screenplay, unique direction, and some great cinematography and music.",

Because of the influence and advice of the lawyers, the relationship between the two changes in such a way that they find it difficult to remain friends and now have to compete with each other about the costs and the regulation of how much time each will have with their son Henry (Azhy Robertson).With this film they show how difficult it is to arrange an official divorce and how the accompanying rules sometimes make it more difficult for both parties. The film brings both sides of the woman and man forward in a good and equal way, so that you as a viewer can feel sorry for both. As a viewer, you quickly get pity for their son, who stands between the two divorcing parents, because the film shows how divorce can affect the child or children of the divorcing parents.The acting is also done well in the film.

Charlie (Driver) and Nicole (Johansson) have spent years raising their son and working creatively together in a New York Theatre company, but their irresolvable differences have pushed them towards divorce. Although they wish to end things amicably, bloodthirsty lawyer Nora Fanshaw (Laura Dern) steps in and pits the warring parties against each other.Marriage Story masterfully showcases the hurt divorce spreads over families each day. As an audience member, I was physically pained to watch Charlie and Nicole's relationship disintegrate even though they both so desperately wanted mutual happiness. This strong emotional drain is due to two main elements, Baumbach's impressive ability to write natural conversation and the lead actors beautifully played roles. Baumbach crafts scenes that are not too dissimilar to early American Independent works that captured life as it really happens. He plants clever \"ticking time bombs\" into every scene that drive the plot forward like an unstoppable train. Driver and Johansson are believable to the point of ridiculousness. I truly felt as though they actually loved each other; I felt the pain behind their words. Most importantly, credit to both writer and actor/actress, I never sensed melodrama.Marriage Story is falls into the category of once every few year character-driven masterpieces. The last of which was Manchester by the Sea. These movies move you, forcing the audience to reevaluate their intentions and their outlook on the world.

            "content": "Maybe it's the relative dearth of movies about real people and real life that has critics and amateur reviewers falling over themselves in praise of Marriage Story. Maybe it's the sheer novelty of being drawn into a story that unfolds on a human scale, without magical powers, cataclysmic action and layers of CGI. Or maybe there's just something about this movies' attempt at a raw and visceral examination of divorce that has pushed buttons on both sides of the gender divide. Marriage Story certainly deserves praise for all those things, even if it doesn't deserve maximum stars and unqualified acclaim. The film's main virtues are the central performances. Driver and Johansson are strong enough to make you care (or almost care) about two not overly likeable characters, and they're real enough to (again, almost) overcome some of the more contrived aspects of the story, dialogue and direction. Even more so, Laura Dern and Alan Alda embody the best, but mostly the worst of the legal system, playing wildly different divorce lawyers - from well-meaning but ineffectual (Alda) to malevolent and toxic (Dern). If there's one aspect of Marriage Story that's truly great, it's the way it totally skewers the legal profession. Aside from that, it's a rather patchy affair. Obviously an acrimonious divorce calls for a flawed couple and some entrenched, unreasonable viewpoints. Even so, it becomes increasingly hard to buy some aspects of the irretrievable differences on show here. Charlie goes on believing that he and Nicole still live in New York, long, long after it is abundantly clear that this isn't the case. And Nicole is just too easily swayed by her rottweiler of a lawyer for us to believe that she's anywhere near as well-intentioned as we're supposed to think she is. The final showdown between the estranged couple - and the big acting tour de force for both leads - is both tortuously contrived and clumsily written. It takes everything Driver and Johansson have to (almost) make it fly. Thereafter Marriage Story becomes quite nauseatingly mawkish and sentimental, so much so that it's almost like another director has been brought in for re-shoots. The lowest point is an extended Sondheim homage that starts with Nicole and her mother and sister in a weirdly slapdash performance of You Could Drive A Person Crazy (they're all playing professional actors, so one has to wonder why it's so bad) and ends with Charlie giving an impromptu and supposedly gut-wrenching piano bar performance of Being Alive (both songs from Sondheim's Company, a show about marriage). It's hard to feel anything other than befuddled when a movie that has spent two hours trying to convince you that it's virtually a docudrama suddenly bursts into song. But if you can, the only conclusion is that Noah Baumbach has failed to come up with any original conclusions about the pros and cons of marriage, and has instead resorted to quoting Stephen Sondheim. And he's not necessarily wrong - there's as much wisdom in those three minutes of Being Alive as there is in the other two hours and twenty minutes of Marriage Story. So, to summarise what Baumbach seems to be saying: divorce is hell, divorce lawyers are evil, nobody really deserves either, but if you're looking for a take on marriage that is both profound and uplifting you should probably get a DVD of Sondheim's Company.",

His writing was also phenomenal, as I found every scene vital to the plot. The script was effectively heart-wrenching and was carried by two awesome leads, at their best. Although the movie was heart-wrenching, there were also other moments when Baumbach offers the audience a laugh, while drawing them back to vulnerabilities of the main characters. The cast was magnificent. Apart from the powerful performances by Driver and Johansson, the audience is able to find depth within each of the supporting characters.",

This film, on the other hand, is really a poor attempt to portray dysfunction and fails, even as it wails, and wails, and wails.It gets two stars for good acting by Laura Dern, Ray Liotta, and Alan Alda, who are not even given top billing. Scarlett Jo and Adam Driver are painful to watch. Sometimes scenes begin without taking any particular direction, or adding anything to a wafer-thin story.Also the purposeful homage to Bergman's \"Scenes from a Marriage\" was a cheap attempt at elevating this thing. And ending with the same text that it started with, well . . . simply lazy.Give it a pass, or use it to help you sleep.",

It is not a romantic comedy (romcom), but is maybe the avant garde of a new genre, the divorce comedy (divcom).Despite the main characters being relatively loathsome, self-absorbed, and otherwise squarely falling into that mythical status of upper-middle class, it is difficult not to stumble along with them for their journey to at least try to become more self-aware. This is accomplished through laughs and cries, songs and dances, and attorneys.ScarJo and AdDr are no Hepburn and Bogart, yet we get an inkling they could be a Taylor and Burton with a few more highballs. The real bravura comes from the side scenes with Laura Dern, Ray Liotta, and Alan Alda, all of whom would likely have seen success as attorneys had life's mysterious quirks nudged them that way.It's nice to see Mr. Liotta in movies again, no longer trying to quit smoking, no longer extolling the virtues of savoring tequila, his face looking so tight he could have gotten whacked in The Irishman without the youth-enhancing algorithms. Better yet, Marriage Story confirms Mr. Alda can do no wrong, whether it be microwaving or eating.",

            "content": "I've tried my best to watch this movie, but simply couldn't keep my focus and attention to this badly scripted, non-creative directing, bad scenario and bad cast. I specifically didn't like the narrations from the both sides or either side of the married couple. I think if a movie needs narration to help it going, then it'd be such mediocre way to make a movie. A movie should not use some lame method as an audio book, if you need the actors to stand on the sideline to narrate and at the same time to act, that's just stupid. It only exposed how mediocre the screenplay writers are. The narration or talking-to-himself -or-herself formula is widely used in the Korean movies. Instead of acting, they used talking to himself or herself to tell the audiences what they were thinking. Narration, likewise, should only used in documentary films, for commercial movies with virtual characters, narration method should be the less the better.I also didn't quite like the male leading actor who actually looked quite dumb and his voice quality was just terrible. I don't know such a mediocre actor would have become a quite hot commodity recently. He just looked dumb, there's nothing on that face could allow me to accept all the roles he played in his recent movies. He just couldn't melt, mix and transform himself into all of the roles he played. He is always HE but not the roles he played.This movie also telling me one thing: Time flies and flies so fast. The leading female actor was once so lovely, young and energetic, but now, she seems suddenly transformed into a tired, spiritless middle aged woman and a very plain one; a very tired face to look at.This is a terribly scripted and poorly directed movie. The casting job is also terrible; so many old faces appeared in this movie and none of them just couldn't give me any realistic feeling of the roles they played. Their long existences in the Hollywood movie industries have already nullified their acting, no matter what roles they played in any movie, they just looked the same. Not quite understand what I said here? Well, go see \"The Irishman\" and \"The Meyerowitz Stories (New and Selected)\", watch those old actors, all of them have become such formulaic and boring actors, no matter what kind of roles they played, they just used their stereotyped and trademarked, never changed acting formulas to waltz through all of the movies. They didn't transform themselves into those roles but only show their own selves again and again, the voice, the accent, the dialog, the body language, the facial expressions they delivered never changed.Sadly, this actor who played the husband role in this movie has already given the doomed impression as those old actors, no matter what the roles he played, he just looked like He, an never changing image outside of the roles or characters he played. And he didn't even looked like a believable husband in this movie. A big mediocre blend plain face with Jackie Chan's outdated hairdo. \"No cheek will be left dry?\" Well, better have your eyes checked soonest.Oh, by the way, if you are really interested in the \"Divorce\" genre movies, besides \"Kramer vs. Kramer (1979)\" that one viewer have already recommended, \"Jodaeiye Nader az Simin - A Separation (2011)\" is an even better viewing experience. Or, if you prefer a 3rd kind of dramatic divorce story, try \"War of The Roses (1989)\", see how a divorce would become so ugly but with a guilty pleasure to watch.

            "content": "This is an adult film, probably most suited for those who have been through divorce. I have not had that pleasure and feel that I may have appreciated this story moreso if I had experienced divorce.The story and the performances delivered are very credible. Driver (as Charlie) arguably has the best scene in the film. However, I would argue that Laura Dern has one of the most amazing performances I've seen this year from a female actress. Her character was one of the best villains I have ever seen. She is a hollow, self-seeking, manipulative and very destructive character who pretends she is virtuous and changes between destructive and sugar coated seamlessly. Otherwise, Dern's portrayal was meant to be virtuous (in which case it's the biggest failure I've seen in many years). I felt shivers when I watched her performance, similar to how I felt watching Phoenix in Joker.For those who will point out Charlie's second lawyer, Jay Marotta (Ray Liotta), his character was nowhere near as well played as Dern. He was destructive, but, he never pretended to be sincere or virtuous.Ultimately, if there's a message I walked away from after watching this movie, it's about effective communication and how to unnecessarily complicate your life with lawyers. There was also an excellent lesson about how two people can be good for each other (especially when complimenting each other's weaknesses) and how Nicole (as a passive aggressive) struggled to take responsibility for her own life, while Charlie (as a perfectionist who was clueless about life outside of work) was made a better man because of Nicole.All in all, I really enjoyed this movie. Dern was the best adult female villain i've seen in cinema in a long, long time. Superb (unless she was meant to be a good person, in which case, this movie deserves a 4/10). In Hollywood today, it's rare to see such a well-crafted female character. Kudos to Baumbach for his courage and foresight to do so.",

Sure there's emotional scenes but nothing too gut wrenching, this film is a lot more subtle than that and paced a lot more slowly than what I expecting and doesn't really have any kind of climax.Driver makes this film though. He gives a fantastic, nuanced performance, and he makes it difficult for me to criticise the movie he is that good.This is a really superbly acted film all round but it's a little self indulgent at times where I felt it needed to move things on - the singing sequence is a perfect example.

            "content": "I've not waited for this much for any other movie from this year. Marriage Story entertained me in all the way it could. So beautifully and accurately portrayed a separation between two characters (Charlie and Nicole) this movie is going to be staying with me for a very long time. And why this divorce story is titled Marriage Story you need to have a look. From the very beginning seeing the couples have been writing about each other, my eyes got struck. But then it turns out they are on their divorce phrase and they are being told to write about each other in front of a marriage counselor. But Nicole doesn't seem to like what she has just written. So usually she gets angry and gets out of the room.That's how the movie starts. And then it goes deeper through the characters and gives us reasons for the causing and it looks like, that million other divorce cases. 'A Separation', 'Revolutionary Road' or 'Before Midnight' there are a lot of movies made of this same category. But Marriage Story is surely one of the greatest of them. It moves us from the deep inside. It is relatable even if you've never been married but has gone through a breakup. It too looks deep into a couples and their internal issues. The huge fight scene at the end gave me chills just like those fight scenes in Revolutionary Road and Before Midnight.Marriage Story is so well written and personally, I don't want anything more from a movie. I just want a movie that needs to be about people like us and they have to face situations like ours. And Marriage Story is definitely the film to relate our-selves at any phase of our lives. Also, what I want to say is that the screenplay is the most important part of a film and Noah Baumbach did it very well here. The dialogues, they are accurate, like what real people would say. Some moments, so beautifully written to fill our hearts and that's enough for me to give a film full 10 out of 10.The performance from Scarlett Johansson probably is so far the best of her career. And I would definitely say the performance of Adam Driver here is nothing less than Joaquin Phoenix in 'Joker'. Above all, Marriage Story is an emotional journey about two individuals, who were supposed to be together is splitting up. Not just depressing or sad the movie has its moments on comedy too and it's beautiful to look at, nice to listen to and deep to take in.",

Most people don't actually know what they want and just get carried away by the waves. By the time you wake up, you realize so many things could have been avoided but you are so far gone already that there is no turning back.

            "content": "I always knew Noah Baumbach had it in spades. His first couple of films hinted at it; \"The Squid & the Whale\" confirmed it and he's never looked back since then. Certainly not as prolific as Woody Allen to whom he's sometimes compared, there's a sadness and depth to his work that only a few Allen pictures captured while at the same time being devastatingly funny and I do think devastating is the most appropriate word for the best of Baumbach.From \"The Squid & the Whale\" onwards, everything he's done has been painfully funny but \"Marriage Story\" is his first masterpiece, (I'm sure there will be others). Apparently autobiographical to a large degree it's a two hour plus dissection of a divorce rather than the marriage that preceded it with nods to both Woody Allen and Ingmar Bergman, most noticeably referenced by a poster for \"Scenes from a Marriage\", seen early on so as to get it out of the way.Charlie, (Adam Driver), is a New York Theatre director and Nicole, (Scarlett Johansson), his LA born actress wife who may or may not have given up a lucrative career on the screen to come to New York and act with his mostly experimental theatre group that also includes Wallace Shawn. They have an eight year old son Henry, (an excellent Azhy Robertson), who seems to take their divorce and being shunted from the East to the West Coast with a degree of pragmaticism unusual for a child. Despite tearning emotional strips off each other every now and then Charlie and Nicole still seem to love each other or at least like each other very much and despite divorcing and living on opposite sides of the country they obviously need each other, particularly when there's a powercut.And yes, like all of Baumbach's works this is painfully funny; laugh-out-loud funny several times over but also uncomfortable and even painful to watch on occasion and sometimes moving from one extreme to the other in the same scene. It's beautifully written by the always literate Baumbach and magnificently acted by the entire cast. Driver and johansson have never been better, (his rendition of Sondheim's 'Being Alive' is a killer moment), while Laura Dern and Alan Alda as two of their lawyers are both Oscar-worthy. (Ray Liotta is also superb as the kind of lawyer who might have just walked out of \"Goodfellas\"). It's also great to see \"Airplane\" actress Julie Hagerty in a role worthy of her talents as Johansson's ditzy mother.Baumbach also has great fun contrasting the differing lifestyles of artists in New York, (anal retentive), and LA, (vacuous and rich), while one of the film's running gags is that everyone in LA keeps referring to its biggest selling point as 'the space'. That it ends on a note of optimism is testament to Baumbach's overriding belief in humanity and if he sides with Driver it's probably because Driver is just Baumbach with a pout.",

You can almost take every scene and point to a scene in a Woody film and they are basically identical.Noah needs his OWN voice and style. The writing is so overly written and not very believable because of that.It's just a mixture of Manhattan and Husbands and Wives.I like that he tries to make it natural and somewhat documentary feel to it, but the writing didn't feel authentic, especially the dialogue.But he doesn't have the humor of Allen so it's Allen stripped of the comedy, despite his efforts, which makes for a rather dull film. Most directors are obviously influenced by previous films, but eventually create their own style. Noah seems to have become more and more like Allen rather than creating his own style.Too much \"clever\" repartee and some of the cursing just seemed so out of place for the characters.Adam Driver was miscast and Julie Hagerty seemed to have purposely cast to add humor, but again it feels forced and inorganic.My main issue with the film was that I didn't buy the whole premise of two people wanting to resolve their issues between them but kept using THE MOST AGGRESSIVE attorneys that would yank up expenses. It made no sense. They would meet with the attorneys and have ridiculously contested issues and accusations and then in private an hour later they would be totally civil. Some of the scenes were just so over the top and not believable.Go watch War of The Roses, at least that was somewhat fun.",

            "content": "I came in to this movie hoping for something resembling a story of two adults doing what's best for their child even though they were going through a divorce. What I got was one adult, Charlie (Adam Driver) being dragged through a river of crap by his selfish, child of a wife Nicole (Scarlett Johansson).Although the writers make an effort to portray Nicole as a victim by virtue of her moving to NYC to be with Charlie, the film backtracks on that narrative by Nicole's own admission that she was miserable in L.A. because of her then boyfriend. Nicole needed a change of scenery. Enter Charlie. She met him, moved to NYC, married him, worked with him to create a successful business, and then pulled the rug out from under him once his fame began to surpass her own.In an effort to justify her behavior, Nicole alludes to an \"affair\" Charlie had, but we later learn that it only occurred after he and Nicole were separated but under the same roof. As Charlie put it, he was sleeping on the couch at that point and living with a woman who loathed him for his success and her belief that she gave up too much when she (voluntarily) left L.A.Every act taken by Nicole in this film screams of weakness and insecurity. Nicole can be pushed and pulled in whatever direction anyone wants her to take. She and Charlie agree that they don't want a nasty divorce. So, what does she do? She hires the nastiest divorce lawyer in L.A. at the suggestion of a woman she has known for five minutes. She moves their son to L.A. under false pretenses and files for divorce in L.A. Why? Because her attorney told her to. The goal? To make sure Charlie has to hire an L.A. lawyer at great expense. You see, she knows he can't afford to fight for custody in L.A. But is that enough? Nope. Nicole then goes all over L.A. meeting with other divorce attorneys. Why does she do this (with her kid in tow mind you) when she already has an attorney? To create a conflict of interest in case Charlie wanted to retain a competent attorney of his own. Attorneys can't work with Charlie once she has poisoned the well you see. She does all this to make sure Charlie can't see his child. Meanwhile, she acknowledges how great of a dad he is. \"He does the things for their son that should bother him, and enjoys doing it. To the point that she hates him for it\".This was all done before Charlie even knows what's coming. In the meantime, Nicole continues to shower Charlie with praise and assure him she wants what's best for both of them. But, you see, Nicole is a coward. She cannot fight her own fights, and despite paying tens of thousands of dollars for her attorney (but first making sure that Charlie has to pay 30% of it), she forces her sister to serve Charlie with divorce papers. Why would she make her sister do this when it would only cost a couple hundred bucks to have it done by an actual process server? Well, because this hurts more. Charlie is close with Nicole's family. In fact, it's the only family he has and has ever had. So, naturally, Nicole wants his sister in law to serve him with the divorce papers. \"You have to take a side\" she tells her mom. \"You can't have a relationship with Charlie anymore\" under any circumstances. Why? Because, it's about the hurt. Nicole is an insecure child. Her only satisfaction in this film comes from forcing others to share in her misery.As Nicole drags everyone else into her miserable existence with the hope that it will prop her up, Charlie continues propping up others around him despite his misery. He is a legitimately good person who doesn't deserve the hand he is being dealt. In a fruitless effort to fight for his child, he throws away a $625,000 grant which was supposed to be used for his business. He becomes a victim to a society and a court system that assumes fathers are pieces of crap while mothers can do no wrong. Ironically, at one point in the film Nicole's rabid attorney states the exact opposite, that Nicole needs to be perfect but Charlie can be a buffoon. Those who live in reality know that is not the case. It takes something bordering on child endangerment before a mother loses priority when it comes to custody.Ultimately, Charlie does what every man seems to do in these films. He loses. First he loses his wife because she decides on a whim that New York is no longer good enough. Then he loses his son when she moves him to L.A. under the cover of night. Finally, Charlie loses his livelihood when he can no longer afford to keep the theater open and has to choose between his life's work and his son. As the film closes we see that he has lost once more. He has lost his will to fight. He takes a menial job in Los Angeles (to Nicole's dismay mind you) directing small bit plays. His status as an up and coming Broadway director is gone. Nicole has gotten everything she wanted without even the tiniest compromise. Charlie has lost everything. He has been handed a pile of crap by his wife and is being told in no uncertain terms that he will eat it and tell her how great it tastes. If he refuses, he won't see his child.While it is obvious that Johannson is not Nicole, she embodies her completely, and I personally wonder if I will enjoy her other movies in the future given how despicable a character Nicole is in this film. 5 stars out of 10 for the acting and direction, but the way Nicole's character was written makes me wonder what the goal of this film is. It certainly is not intended to make anyone feel good about the state of humanity as it currently exists.",

Is great directed, it has an awesome score, an amazing screenplay, and two insanely good performances. That's the main highlight for me tho, besides all the other great stuff, Adam Driver and Scarlett Johansson just kill it in the movie.My God, they are such talent actors, and they give them all here. I've been following Adam's career since he got cast as Kylo Ren, and I have yet to see a movie where he isn't good in it, the guy is a freaking monster. I think is fair to say I've seen less of Scarlett's work besides the Marvel films, but still, I know she is great for movies like Hail, Cesar, or Her for example. Anyways, the point is they are both insanely great in the movie.What helps both actors is that characters are incredible well written, they feel like real people, with flaws, and the movie takes its time to let you know them, see their side of the story, and that helps a lot, the material they have to work with is great.One thing that I didn't see a lot of people talking about is the score. Man, I love almost every musical bit in the movie (besides one of the last fell ones, that's actually performed by Adam Driver, which a thought was... weird, at best). The score overall is flawless tho. It adds a lot to the movie itself.I talk to a friend about it, and he said he thought the movie didn't have a \"message\", besides showing kind of how a marriage process works. I disagree tho. I think the movie's main message it's not exactly about that, I think the movie shows how connected your life is to another person when you married, and consequently, how difficult is to \"disconnect\", and mainly, that love is... weird, and it doesn't need vanish, after the divorce, you had a strong feeling for that person at one point, and she/he was a crucial part of your life, you'll probably still feel something afterwards, some form of love... and that's beautiful!Idk, I haven't been married at this point, so I guess I'm not the most adequate person to talk about the subject, regardless, that was my take on it.9,5/10",

Let me make this simple: Marriage Story is not about the difficulties of divorce. It's a public service announcement (PSA) story created by Noah Baumbach to warn us of the perils of Marriage, especially as it concerns fatherhood.Now the following isn't a spoiler because with very few exceptions aside this is how divorce works --There are no villains in Marriage Story, only two flawed human beings, but make no mistake about it... the wife makes out like gangbusters here, as they almost always do. She basically got everything she wanted and more. She got the Kid, at least half of everything, and essentially made her ex-husband have to relocate to L.A. so he could be a father to his son.It's a very sobering film that should be made required viewing for all guys.\nNoah Baumbach did a great job writing and Directing. Adam Driver and Scarlett Johansson were both really terrific, though I think that Laura Dern was the real standout in a scintillating supporting role. She totally deserves an Oscar nomination.The only reason I didn't rate it higher is because it's so simple and straight forward. It's a very well executed, but vanilla slice of life Marriage Story.",

The directing is precise and highlights all the mixed emotions, conundrums and contradictions. The couple's inner conscious and subconscious life as opposed to their demeanors and actions are so spot on. The acting by the two leads are spectacular. They both got nominated for Oscars and Golden Globes. I personally think Scarlett should have won. Even if Adam may have been bested by Joachim, the magic of seeing both of them interact against each other in a few key scenes including the most intense one is what makes it an outstanding piece. Laura Dern's delicious take on the smart, seductive,cut-throat lawyer is deserving to win both Oscar and Golden Globe Best Supporting Actress. The legal aspects of the divorce are both frustrating and comical. They are costly in money but also in humanity. It gets ugly and probably worse in real life.The film and screenplay were also both nominated for both top awards. There is not much better made films about relationships falling apart ever made. There is a nod in the film to seminal Scenes from a Marriage masterpiece by Bergman and perhaps Farhadi's A Separation also comes closest to represent this harsh reality.This film is almost too close for comfort for anyone who has lived a similar separation as a child or a part of the couple. It feels real and emphasises, without direct finger-pointing, the lack of judgement, love, humanity and humility. When the separation starts to spin out of control, both inner and outer forces seem to be pulling in all directions and wrecking often irreparable destruction.A fine film and fair warning.Wishing you all a happy and long-lasting marriage.",

In the last decade we saw a lot of pro-this anti-that cinema but this movie avoids taking sides in the political conversation and prefers to do what art is meant to do in culture: create or exemplify beauty and myths. This is a great accomplishment in writting, it reminded me of the best Almod\u00f3var dramedies where everything bad that is meant to happen is going to happen and you get to know and love the characters for what they do in these situations, not for what it is imply about them. I think both Adam Driver and Scarlett Johansson gave great performances but it's Driver's that really gets into your skin. The story about a real (almost too real) broken man dealing with a horrible situation is something that Hollywood has seem to put away in the closet for a long time. I haven't liked any Noah Bumbach's films until this one, but keep them coming. It was great.",

            "content": "Marriage Story - Probably the most real, honest and heartfelt movie seen in this year.\nI remember being completely smitten by Scarlett Johansson ever since I saw her in Woody Allen's Match Point, but, then again, never considered her to be anything more than a decent actor. And as for Adam Driver, never considered him anything. Probably, Logan Lucky was his only movie which I barely liked.\nHad it not been for the glowing reviews, I might've skipped this one too.So, despite MS not being my first choice to watch on a Friday Night, I reluctantly gave in to the reviews and was prepared as well to feel little underwhelmed with the final product, as it happens to me most of the time.But this one got me from it's unconventional opening scene itself, where each of the character's voiceover sharing all the positive things about their respective partner that made them fall in love in the first place. And the movie begins.Honestly, I never knew Scarlett Johansson can ACT and I mean ACT this good. Was simply blown away with the plethora of emotions she portrayed and that too without ever going over the top.And, then there is Adam Driver, if Scarlett Johansson was great, then he was out of the world. His character was selfish, arrogant and demanding. And yet, never in the movie his flaws were sugarcoated to gulp down the audiences' throat. People are flawed and this movie is as real as it's characters. There's a scene where his character breaks down, and weeps uncontrollably with an equally broken down Johansson consoling him. That, to me, is the performance of the year. Then again, we have Joaquin Phoenix's Arthur Fleck as well this year.This ultimately is the poignant tale of a NYC couple going through a divorce in LA and how they both cope up with the new changes, lawyers, courts, judges & dealing with their respective professions and still maintain their sanity for their only son, builds the simple premise.Though I don't think the movie will find the appreciation from all corners as it's on a very serious subject devoid of any entertainment, but those, looking for really good and sensible dramas, should certainly look it up.",

But what's most important to remember is that even though divorce can be painful, it is ultimately necessary in order to move on with your life and not cause you or the person you once loved anymore pain because at the end of the day, we're all still human. Scarlett Johannsson and Adam Driver are absolutely perfect as well as soul crushing in this movie. I personally don't care about the Oscars, but I can guarantee that this movie and their performance's are gonna get a lot of well deserved recognition. Noah Baumbach has made a modern masterpiece that is equal parts funny, heartbreaking, and completely authentic. And this movie easily gets a 10/10 from me.",

A couple going through rough divorce and their compelling will and fight for everything, it could be said even for their lives as it turns into hell.It seems like Noah keeps bringing us more and more and more, as it keeps getting powerful and powerful. If you imagine perfect marriage that does not exist this is the best next thing to that and we are able to see it from both eyes of him and her. It's crazy how much hurt can bring you things that you love and how much love can bring you things that hurt. Seems like paradox but eventually it is what it is and Marriage Story is all of that and much more.Measures and distances that humans are willing to go and fight for just increase with love and that is what this movie is trying to portray and it absolutely did. Directing by Noah is also pretty interesting to watch as he takes some different approaches to give us sense of distance and loneliness, on the other side closeness and love. It absolutely is drama filled with emotions but after you end the movie there is a big appreciation for those humorous scenes that made you laugh even though consciousness is hitting you like, It's bad, This is sad, Don't forget what you are watching and then you are back to sadness that this story is giving you all along.Let's just say that Scarlett Johansson and Adam Driver are so beautifully great and keep pulling you to each side with their emotional roller coaster that Noah has put them on and they deserve all praises for their performance. Each of them brings their talents that are amazing that they can play whatever they want. Hands up one of the best duos (male-female) that is charismatic, profound andd emotional to the skies.Brilliant, Emotional, Powerful. 4/4",

            "content": "Noah Baumbach's \"Marriage Story\" begins with a slideshow of a man and a woman over which we hear narrations, each of them describing themselves and praising their family qualities. These descriptions are carefully written, their qualities grand beyond family life, is like they are trying to sell themselves for a job interview. But no, these are husband Charlie (Adam Driver) and wife Nicole (Scarlett Johansson) and the descriptions are what they each wrote about the other. They are in a counseling office--they are getting a divorce.Two qualities make this movie great. First of all, is the balancing act between the two parties and the second is its unpretentiousness. \"Marriage Story\" has no subliminal meaning, the divorcing couple don't act like some sort of higher symbols--what you see is what you get. The balancing act, though, happens on multiple levels. For starters, is the fact that Nicole and Charlie still love and collaborate with each other despite the divorcing act--which started without lawyers--becomes an interstate case between Los Angeles and New York--two polarizing states, both geographically and culturally. Then, is the fact that you don't know who to root for. The divorce is as complicated for the viewers as it is for the characters.The reason for divorcing is nothing too tragic--typical middle-to-upper class stuff. Charlie is an acclaimed theater director respected on Broadway and despite not being born on the East Coast he is \"more of a New Yorker than a New Yorker\" according to his wife. Nicole is an actress playing in his productions but who feels the need to break free. Her ambitions are more Hollywood and LA than NY. They also have a son, Henry (Azhy Robertson), caught in between. Happily, he is too young to suffer too much.All the performances are astounding. Driver as the workaholic but caring husband, Laura Dern as Nora Fanshaw--Nicole's LA smart, upper-class feminist lawyer--but Johansson steals the show. Her ability to direct her emotions--crying, angry, laughing, regretful--is brilliant. Her performance truly is theatrical--tragic, dramatic but not overly-dramatic. A definite Oscar contender. Throughout the movie, as the divorce escalates, there is clearly a slight bias towards Nicole, but Baumbach's on-point writing is careful so that Charlie doesn't come off as a complete loser. His career is thriving and his unusual friendship with his mother-in-law offers some of the funniest and warmest moments in the movie. She is the one who secretly recommended him an affordable lawyer. She wasn't doing that because she is against Nicole, but because he likes Charlie too much.While this movie is straight-forward, there is a particular lengthy scene worth mentioning (no, is not the fighting scene albeit it was perfectly executed). The scene in which an appointed expert evaluator monitors a night in with Charlie and Henry is as strange as such an experience is expected to be. Such things involve the evaluator watching the family's natural behavior but can anyone act naturally under such conditions? The scene ends with a clever \"accident\" caused by such a procedure and it no doubt lead the evaluator to many misunderstandings.\"Marriage Story\" is no doubt a movie that could happen to only a middle-to-upper class couple. Charlie and Nicole--the middle-aged and the restless--are people who are both artistically-inclined and privileged enough to want more specific things. And with a child bonding them, their official separation feels like it exists only on paper. But sometimes that is enough. Even if, in the end, a winner was declared, Nicole's career was floating and Charlie was surrounded by his friends and peers, they both lost.",

            "content": "Director Noah Baumbach has created a beautiful piece of cinema with Marriage Story. A heartfelt and honest retelling of a divorce between two patrons of theatre, the dance between leads Adam Driver (Charlie) and Scarlett Johansson (Nicole) is captivating cinema. Their interactions span quiet conversation to explosive argumentation, and they move seamlessly between the two thanks to a razor sharp script. The real art, however, is the infused comedic elements: they are subtle and disguised, but are welcome in snapping the viewer back to the realities of each situation.The couple's lives are a myriad of compromises that increase in complexity: whether to live in NYC or LA, who their young son Henry should stay with, and who's career prospects warrants the next jump into the unknown. Their divorce proceedings are amicable to begin, but external parties circumstances muddy the waters and soon every detail is scrutinised and manipulated. Watching the divorce lawyers have the argument they themselves cannot wrestle with is a bizarre concept, but shows the soullessness that breaking up a marriage can require; on top of this, the lawyers know nothing between them is personal, but that couldn't be further from the truth for Charlie and Nicole.The leads (and, indeed, the majority of the cast) are superb in their casting and performances. Adam Driver is already an actor I hold in very high regard - his flexibility and comedic qualities are a true gift, but his compassion and anger when acting are so believable. I feel some remorse for Johansson, in that she is largely known for her one-dimensional requirements to play Black Widow in the Marvel franchise, but this sort of work demonstrates her real talent in more weighty roles. The snap of the script is made even more impressive by knowing that virtually nothing is improvised - Baumbach has their hesitations and outbursts orchestrated to the finest details.Cinematographically, Marriage Story uses unique angles and environmental features to accentuate each shot and the feelings conveyed: the attitudes of the arthouse couple inspire these frames, where open plan rooms alongside continuous shots are effectively used. Some scenes are also filmed with shallow depths of field to make the subject sharp and resolute, a technique given additional power by the grainy effect applied to the footage. Classical compositions often accompany the emotion of the moment, but some scenes are bereft of music to let the viewer decide the mood for themselves.Baumbach's directorial methodology might be painstaking, but the rewards are clear to see. His vision is infectious, and he demonstrates such a unique style that, even if you cannot empathise with the story from personal experience, you become drawn in. Both Driver and Johannson may be in line for some heavyweight nominations come awards season, and any victories would be, in my book, wholly justified.",

The three basic reasons for the success of this film is Noah , Scarlett and Adam. This movie is an acting ring having Scarlett and Adam competing with Noah as a referee and he handled the match perfectly. But I felt that Adam's performance was way better than Johansson's in every scene they were in it together I couldn't take my eyes off him even the master scene between them he won at the end of that scene with a K.O. Scarlett is doing her first awesome performance but I can't say it is one of the greatest performance ever but I can relate If she won the Oscar this year cause of the lack of powerful performances in Leading Actress category. The screenplay and the way Noah told this movie felt like I were in the 60s of the 2010s! The scenes and the looks of it made me feel most of it that it was in the past a really perfect look for each scene. The screenplay almost concluded everything that has to do with the divorce matter and lawyers interference in the whole subject and turning it into was. However, the movie had boring moments and the sexual stuff in it especially for Scarlet's character felt unnecessary on the contrary it is frequent with men which was represented by Adam's character without getting to show it. Also If the score of the film was stronger, it would have added to the scenes a make a better value for them but it was silent most of the film and even at the master scene itself. Didn't feel the kid much in this film or his acting too. In the end, a good movie to watch but I don't think I would watch it again. 7/10",

They're great throughout the whole film, but there is a certain scene in this movie that everybody will talk about and it floored me. They way they act towards each other, they have great chemistry. Laura Dern also did a great job, playing a slimeball lawyer who keeps taking Johansson's character into things she doesn't want to do.\nThe real hero of this story however is Noah Baumbach, who also wrote the film and deserves all the praise. He is a true master in writing and directing. He makes all of it seem effortless, with unprecedented results. He could truly be one of the last true story tellers working today.\nOverall, the movie to me is basically flawless. It makes you laugh; it makes you cry; it even makes you feel things you can't identify.

            "content": "Writer/director Noah Baumbach delivers a career best in this funny, sad, infuriating, heartbreaking story about the dissolution of a marriage. Adam Driver is proving himself to be one of the best actors of his generation, and I've long thought that Scarlett Johansson was underappreciated. Both get a chance to shine in this film, along with supporting players Laura Dern, Alan Alda, and Ray Liotta, all three playing divorce attorneys of varying stripes. The film is about how the machine of divorce tramples over those who have the best intentions, and about the near impossibility of remaining civil when the system benefits from people acting like savages.I wasn't prepared for the film to be as funny as it is at times, which makes its poignant moments all the more affecting by comparison. The script is full of memorable set pieces, all of them brilliantly acted. Such as the miserably depressing one that finds Driver's dad determined to take his son trick-or-treating in L.A. Or a jaw dropping argument between Driver and Johansson that ends in both saying the kinds of things that would alter a relationship forever. Or the incredibly cringey scene where a case worker visits Driver's apartment to observe his parenting skills and ends with him blood soaked and fainting on the kitchen floor. Or the moment toward the end when Driver breaks into an impromptu performance of the song \"Being Alive\" at a New York bar, and which confirmed my belief that there's a Stephen Sondheim song for literally every life event that perfectly articulates what it's like to go through it.\"Marriage Story\" is easily one of the best movies of the year.Grade: A+",

Adam Driver's performance is by no means any less than hers, but Johansson is the star of the film. The carefully crafted and chiseled performances by all the cast is proof of the callibre of the acting talent involved in this film.Speaking of performances, it is worth mentioning the skillful hands of Noah Baumbach, who has meticulously crafted each short. Through consistent choreography, unique stage-play of the characters, he has tried to implant drama in a more subtle and nuanced way. Long monologues from characters makes the film and the performances more believable and also effective.Overall this is an extraordinary film.",

            "content": "\"Divorce is like a death without a body.\"With nearly half of all marriages ending in divorce in America, this quote from Noah Baumbach's new film now rings truer than ever.Debuting on Netflix, \"Marriage Story\" centers on the relationship between Charlie and Nicole Barber. Charlie is an emerging New York theatre director and Nicole is a revered actress who's followed him on the stage for the last decade. The good times are over now and the couple is in the process of divorce, with their eight-year-old son, Henry, caught in the middle.The couple first decided to part ways amicably, but over time things got messier with lawyers and a sudden move by Nicole to Los Angeles. Now on opposite coasts, the two sides must bear the immense strain of splitting up while still trying to keep some semblance of their family together.The 10th feature from Baumbach (and second for Netflix), the unfolding of \"Marriage Story\" takes several cues from its stage theatre setting.Numerous scenes play out in long, uninterrupted takes as characters move around the space, delivering monologues aimed at the audience just as much as they are at other characters. The blocking of each camera and character movement is superb as it allows scenes to flow with grace and deliver their maximum effect.Accenting Baumbach's work behind the camera is an orchestral score from legendary musician Randy Newman. The score calls back to Newman's similar work in \"Toy Story\" as the mood swings back and forth from playful to somber.A writer first and director second, Baumbach's screenplay contains both unparalleled honesty and authenticity. The film opens with Charlie and Nicole saying what they love about the other, only for it to be revealed that it's all part of an exercise assigned to them by their divorce counselor. This perfect establishing scene and many others work wonders at making us feel for their relationship and connect it to our experiences, both good and bad.Being as this is a semi-autobiographical film for Baumbach about his earlier divorce, you may fear that bias would be present. Luckily, Baumbach isn't interested in taking sides. He may give Charlie a little more of the benefit of the doubt, but overall he paints a balanced picture where both the features and flaws of each character are on display.And despite the depressing subject matter, the film is still able to be quite funny as comedy gets weaved throughout. This is usual for Baumbach, who uses humor as an addition to the drama rather than a clean break from it.Playing Charlie and Nicole is Adam Driver and Scarlett Johansson, respectively. Each of them is amazing on their own and will deservedly be showered with awards this season.They each have their big individual scenes and one grand, one together, but where they each make their money is in the little scenes between the big ones. A small facial movement here or special line delivery there goes a long way in developing who they are and what they stand for.Laura Dern is also great as Nicole's no-nonsense lawyer, Nora. Dern has made a name for herself as tough characters, and she continues that here with a fierce, commanding performance.Alan Alda and Ray Liotta play Charlie's two lawyers that have two very different styles that complement each of their acting strengths. Alda is the gentler and presentable one when compared to Liotta's more hostile and brash demeanor.Never before has a film been so pleasantly depressing and genuinely funny at the same time. You'll laugh, you'll cry, or you'll do both at the same time. By the time the credits start rolling, you'll have been on a journey with not just these characters, but also with yourself.",

The movie scratches the souls of viewers by dramatizing the tenacious claws of the legal professionals that make money on human disappointment and conflicts.The Marriage Story starts from at the breaking point of a marital relationship. Love has expired, but careers have advanced. For the main characters to get through this chaotic stressful process, therapist and legal advisors are called upon to ameliorate the situation. The beginning of the movie starts with the introduction of each character through the use of the opposing spouse's description. It creates a bridge of understanding for viewers, regarding the marital relationship. However, the break up, without legal action is unavoidable. That's why a significant part of the movie concerns legal intervention at the final point of the marriage.The movie dialogue, especially that of Laura Dern's character, is particularly brilliant. Her monologue that most people deprived from fatherhood (God is father, father is on the heaven, accordingly children do not need to see their fathers - is a pretty persuasive rhetorical hook) sounds so argumentative, despite certain critics of the Christianity could be found (negligence in faith-based issues, presumption of inequality and etc.). Much of the lead characters exposition is reeled through the legal proceedings. Certain scenes look like the remake of Revolutionary Road (2008) with Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet).

The performances are nuanced, truthful, and deeply honest about the humanity of the characters. The writing does a great job of making the viewer sympathize with both the wife and the husband; each is portrayed by turns as both the villain and the victim, so ultimately both are merely human. The ending, while to me unsatisfying overall, did leave a glimmer of hope that the divorced characters will somehow learn to be friends and make this awkward, fractured-family thing work.However, be warned the whole movie is VERY depressing! I was disappointed that neither character grows or changes from their journey in any significant way. They both end the film just as self-centered and self-serving as they were at the beginning. This is not really a \"marriage story\". A marriage story would have its characters learn some things about commitment and compromise and self-sacrifice for the love of their family. They might learn how to actually work through their issues. But the title is misleading: this is really a divorce story, albeit an honestly-written, exquisitely-acted one, but ultimately a sad, shallow view of marriage.Best Acting? Absolutely.

            "content": "It would seem natural to start talking about \"Marriage Story\" with something like \"there is life beyond Kylo Ren and Natasha Romanoff\", in tribute to the two leads progressing from blockbuster pop icons to Oscar calibre performers. But I am going to start with director-writer Noah Baumback first.In 2005, I watched \"The squid and the whale\", also written and directed by Baumback, earning him Sundance awards for both these categories, although none of the more glamorous awards for which it was also nominated. I beg indulgence is excerpts from my IMDb user review of that movie.\"This is a very realistic, honest depiction of the drama of life. The fact that it is so good is due very much to its very close to being writer-director Noah Baumbach's auto-biography\" I thus described \"The squid and the whale\". These comments applies equally to \"Marriage story\".\"The squid and the whale\" is also about a failed marriage, as we the audience we see \"the characters' struggles throughout the movie, against themselves and against each other, to find a balance in a life that will go on. At various times, you learn to like or dislike these characters, but never without a sense of sympathy for their helplessness. In the end, you have a deeper understanding that life sometimes does take such turns, and you recognize it in people around you, some of whom you know quite well.\" So much for \"The squid and the whale\", which for most part is from the POV of the young children. \"Marriage story\" goes directly and unflinchingly into the couples' inner world.While many also compare \"Marriage story\" to \"Kramer vs Kramer\", there are significant difference. While the key plotline for both is custodianship battle, \"Kramer\" is also very much a father-and-son bonding story, maybe even more so. In \"marriage story\", on the other hand, the son is neutral and seems equally agreeable to living with the father or mother. In Kramer, the Oscar wins were Best Lead Actor for Dustin Hoffman and Best Supporting Actress for Merly Streep. For \"Marriage story\" is will be most surprising if Adam Driver (playing Charles) and Scarlette Johansson (playing Nicole) are not both nominated for their respective lead roles.I won't go into the details of how what started as a perfect marriage ends up failing. The general verdict of critics seems that neither is entirely at fault. It's just one of those things. So, let's leave it at that.What I final most moving in this movie is the light touches (and Baumback is superb with those) that make your heart bleed in hoping that they would get back together after all: such as in the lunch break in the meeting at the legal office Charles stares at the menu, completely at a loss and Nicole takes it off his hand and orders for him; such as at a brief evening visit Nicole observes Charles's \"shaggy\" appearance and ends upon cutting his hair for him (something she has always done for the family); such as at the closing scene (after the custodian dispute has been resolved reasonably amicably), Nicole notices that Charles's shoelace is loose, calls him to stop and ties it up for him (he is holding their son, going away to spend a day with him). There are many such touches, as I call them, but the most heart-breaking thing is to see the two of them, in a throng of people, exchanging glances and gazes as if they are the only two persons in the world.To-date, \"Marriage story\" has collected 35 awards and earned close to 100 nominations. As I said, it is almost a certainty that both Driver and Johansson will be nominated for best lead role in Oscar. If they both win it will be well-deserved, not only for their heart-felt, nuanced performances throughout but also for an emotionally explosive scene in the middle that leaves the audiences breathless and sobbing at the same time. There is a solid support cast, of which the three lawyers are most noteworthy. Honoured with a Golden Globe support nomination is Laura Dern playing Nicole's super-aggressive lawyer Nora. Hall-of-fame class veteran Alan Alda plays Charles's first lawyer Bert, semi-retired and eventually fired for being too soft. Picking thing up from him is Jay, a lawyer worth Nora's steel, played by veteran screen tough guy Ray Liotta.",

As much as I love Scarlet as a versatile actor, I could not help but despise her character. Woman who has it all - a husband who cooks, cleans, is a wonderful father and is able to provide for the family financially. Most importantly, a husband who shows restraint at his wife's wild behaviour and not for one moment falls to her level. And yet, she tears him apart financially, physically and emotionally all in the name of self entitlement.Lawyers are the only winners in this movie, but yet it shows why amicable separation is absolutely essential for a peaceful breakup with flawless direction, amazing script and phenomenal acting performances throughout.Relocation of children is one of the most difficult personal and legal battles the left behind parent can face, and Nicole in this movie made it an impossible task for Charlie to be a father without turning his life upside down. Why? For control. Charlie foresaw it all, but it was inevitable because of Nicole's behaviour, or to give her the benefit of the doubt, ignorance.The best aspects about this movie is that it keeps the viewer engaged all throughout, the acting is utterly superb, and it keeps you hoping for a happy ending to Charlie's extreme struggles as a father, but as the movie ends we learn that Charlie is yet again a victim of Nicole's controlling behaviour but he is willing to compromise for the happiness of the child. It is an absolute emotional rollercoaster. It is a devastating watch for a father, mainly because it is such a real and raw depiction of marriage, separation, divorce and the business of lawyers and courts.It is without question a 10/10 for its flawless direction, acting and ability to keep attention thanks for a script which brings meaning to every word spoken. I would be very surprised if this doesn't take home at least some Oscars, but most of all I think Adam Driver's transformation from happy to sad, from calm to stressed, is an unfortunate joy to watch on screen.",

            "content": "The divorce would suddenly turn ugly. The lawyers would try every way to make a big deal out of it and try very hard not so easily to settle it in more civilized way.What we got in this movie are a couple who already stayed together, lived together so long. Their family life was as common and ordinary as most the normal married couples in almost any country. They knew each other's good and bad elements, and they've already adjusted themselves to accommodate each other, and they both loved their kid wholeheartedly. Until the husband's Alpha male chauvinism got the high ground, until the wife suddenly realized there're things that she couldn't bulge so easily from her more and more demanding husband. But the husband's ego simply couldn't swallow the sudden change of their marital environment, a climate change in their home.\nAnd gradually the situation deteriorated until to a point of no return.Then lawyers got involved, common laws were implemented, lot of people who related to the couple, the husband and wife also got involved. Once things have turned from bad to worse, the dignity, the face, the whatever would suddenly become so important, so they and everybody started to hurt each other, and the lawyers they hired were circling like vultures and vampires, they smelled blood from a rotten corpse of a marriage, grasped any piece of the rotten meat they could snatch.A once a perfectly synchronized couple, a normal Papa, Mama and kid family was then tore apart. All the intolerance, compromises, niceties, love and good memories were tossed out of the window, the home and the negotiation desk presided by lawyers on both sides became the battlefield. The husband, the wife and especially their kid, became the casualties, the wounds were so deep and wide open, no ambulance could save them in time; they were all the modern day victims from a broken family, not from the gunshot of bullets, but unspeakable, indescribable of all shortcomings as a human, inconciliable, uncompatile, inconciliables blind fury and stubbornness. They were manipulated by their own lawyer to attack, to hurt and retaliate before they were attacked or hurt by the person who sat on the opposite of the negotiation table.My wife told me after she watched this movie: \"Marriage, in the end, only means when you become old, there's someone beside you, a company who dine with you, to take a walk with you, to check on you at night to see if you are still breathing, to accompany you to see the doctor, to pick up your medicine refills for you. The most miserable thing that could ever happen to you is you eat alone, sleep alone; even for the purpose of more peaceful and undisturbed reason, you both decided to sleep in a separate room. I can only say for myself that EATING ALONE, SITTING ALONE and TALKING ONLY TO YOURSELF are the most miserable, pathetic and hopeless things that you have to face and deal with it when you become old. Marriage, is just finding a lifelong person to accompany you when you become old.\"And I have to add just one more line: \"Forget about your kids, your siblings, your....They are just irrelevant 3rd Parties.\"",

Scarlett Johansson and Adam Driver are good actors but that doesn't make it a good movie. As for the comedy, I suppose they meant how they made satirical fun about lawyers and the whole divorce thing, it wasn't great even though I think the same about that subject.

The path the story takes smashes any facade the characters have built and drives to the core of their internal feelings and feelings for each other. It is sobering to watch the couple's relationship escalate in negative intensity. The raw acting takes center stage due to smart yet non-flashy cinematography.

The theatre troupe scenes were terrible (\"A four-time Oscar-winner was sucking my-\" why is this sequence/character in this film?). The abundance of overwritten monologuing. The cloying and contrived reappearance of the letter. Nicole's (Scarlett Johansson, who overall fares better than Driver) big \"It's a game I'm playing with myself!\" moment at the poolside. Their *big fight* (which made me snicker with how phony and forced it was, then appalled by the pseudo-disturbing revelation from Driver). Ordering his lunch for him at the lawyers' meeting, then tying his shoe for him. Pukey, honestly.I'm shocked by the film, and the almost universally positive reactions, especially as this is from the same artist who made one of the great films about an ugly divorce: The Squid and the Whale.There are moments and sequences that work, and even work very well, and some of the acting has special moments of high quality work (from Laura Dern and Alan Alda, especially), but the film as a whole doesn't work at all. I was especially stricken by a scene from the film's shamelessly manipulative second half, as it seems to best reflect a repeated problem with several sequences. It comes when Charlie (Adam Driver) gets up to sing Sondheim's \"Being Alive\" in front of his troupe, then goes to sit down after some awkwardness and mild friendly praise, but then inexplicably stands again and sings more - the rest of the song, in fact - and the film wants so desperately for this sequence to be telling and revelatory, and yet it moves from what starts to approach camp before stumbling into a desperate reach for his character's (clunky) pained lament(s). It's painful, yes, but not as intended, I'm afraid.No one felt like a real person to me. No one talks like these characters talk.The biggest cinematic surprise of the year for me was just how silly this turned out to be.Grade: C-",

And they meet people who are also just people who make no difference. It's the entire painting that's important, like an abstract piece. There's a story sure, but it's something else above it all that's going on. Not sure what it is actually.The movie is good though. It's about a husband and wife getting a divorce. The man is an acclaimed playwriter, and the woman is an actress. There really is no plot. They get a divorce, and have to adjust. That's it.I thought Scarlett was incredible in the scenes I paid attention to. She has such a unique look I wouldn't call beautiful, but a smile that would catch anyone's attention.

            "review_title": "An often poignant story about a declining marriage told with a rare feeling of sincerity",
            "content": "Marriage Story is a comedy-drama written and directed by Noah Baumbach (The Squid and the Whale, Greenberg). Starring Adam Driver and Scarlett Johansson, it is an often poignant story about a declining marriage told with a rare feeling of sincerity.In New York City, Charlie Barber (Adam Driver) lives with his former actress wife Nicole (Scarlett Johansson) and eight-year-old son Henry (Azhy Robertson) where he works as a theatre director for a successful stage company. Due to Charlie's commitment to his hard work, he and Nicole's once happy marriage begins to fall apart, and Nicole decides to move to Los Angeles where she has been offered the lead role in a TV pilot, taking Henry with her. Due to the lengthy travelling distance from east coast to west, Charlie struggles to find time to see Henry in amidst working on his current stage play and risks losing all custody of him in the impending divorce as a result.With its powerful acting and careful direction, Marriage Story successfully sets itself apart from most other family dramas to become one of the best of its genre in years. It is not often to see a film that can balance both sides of the conflict with such care that it makes you truly think about the ramifications it has on not just the two fighting parties in question, but also the other family members as well. What is also taken into consideration is how extended family are affected too, with Nicole's mother and sister clearly having a close relationship with Charlie throughout the film, realising that their lives will be forever changed by this divorce as well. Of course, in the end, it is obvious that the most affected by all of this will be the child, being exposed to such heavy responsibilities at a young age, like deciding which parent they prefer to live with.Writer/director Noah Baumbach handles this subject matter with just the right amount of realism to avoid spiralling into cliched territory. This may be due to the fact that Baumbach is a divorcee himself with a young son, and likely wished to depict this heavy topic as genuine as possible so as to reflect his own personal experiences. As well as this, Baumbach appears to have taken influence from films such as \"Kramer vs. Kramer\" and even his own film, 2005's \"The Squid and the Whale\", all of which dealt with the subject of divorce in both a light-hearted and serious manner. If I did have one problem, it is that the ending does showcase some brief unnecessary sentimentality, which does detract from the previously mentioned realism, but considering what we have seen each character go through, it only feels like a minor issue.Both of the film's lead stars gave excellent performances. Seeing Adam Driver and Scarlett Johansson verbally bounce off one another with such fiery intensity is truly a fascinating sight. I often found myself forgetting the two aren't actually a couple in real life as their chemistry is simply perfect. There is so much to appreciate in each time the two were interacting, thanks in part to Baumbach's solid script, which gave them several memorable scenes depicting the degradation of their marriage.In conclusion, I believe this film will certainly strike a chord with anyone who has been through a divorce or has witnessed one unfold before their eyes. Personally, I haven't experienced either, but that did not affect my overall opinion of the film and that likely shouldn't for anyone else. My advice is to take in what the film has to say on this serious topic and appreciate what its writer/director and lead actors have presented for our viewing pleasure.I rate it 8.5/10",

            "content": "Marriage story is a insightful and solicitous look at a marriage breaking up and a family staying together. The plot is a pastiche of a modern day \"Kramer v. Kramer\". It has lots going for it including two very charismatic and convincing performances by Adam Driver and Scarlett Johansson as a married couple, This is original filmmaking at its finest.\nThe core issue is that the breadwinner is Charlie and his wife Nicole wants to move from NY to LA to get a part in a show. Charlies elects to stay in NY and continue directing his successful broadway plays. Both parties here are selfish. Couples interactions are pure and honest but more importantly real, you don't get to take sides in their problem as well as they both make a good case and put forth good arguments to their difficulties, one other thing I noticed is that it invites you to understand but never forces you to accept it in any way, all of this comes together to describe or at least try to understand the intricacies of a loving marriage.Marriage Story accurately exposes what actually goes on when couples turn to lawyers to help them with their divorce rather than go thru mediation. Kudos for exposing our circus of a legal system and the lawyers who are still practicing this archaic type of matrimonial law that wreaks destruction on parents, children and bank accounts.\nMinus - The couple never actually asks the child what he's going through. Good movie.",

            "content": "This was a Slam Dunk. I had high anticipations for this film but never in my wildest dreams would have expected it to be THAT good. I was sitting through out the film and kept saying to myself during many, many scenes again and again: \"Wow, this is amazing\". I hardly ever experience some reaction as strong as this. It is a true masterpiece. A Modern Kramer Vs Kramer however from a different approach. Noah Baumbach made his masterpiece. The film he will be most remembered for. I always liked him as a filmmaker but also felt he is sometimes receptive, not this time, this time he created something on its very own.\nThe acting is superb to say the least. I always though Scarlett Johansson is an underrated actress, but not even I had the slightest idea that she has \"This\" inside her. What a ride. What a performance. This will be hard to be beaten this year when it comes to actresses. Or actors for that matter. She really showed all of us what an actress she is. And the perfect Middle Finger to everyone who only see her as \"Black Widow\".\nAdam Driver was not far away from the level of quality. In fact he really gave his character so many interesting and different facettes that you felt it was a real person. Both Driver and Johansson achieved that and brought a lot of character development into the mix.\nLaura Dern was also great. You never knew if you should like her or hate her (I guess that depends if you are Team Nicole or Team Charlie). A fantastic turn for Dern who was often ignored to play \"Rich \" like this because she is fabulous in those roles (also see Big Little Lies for ex). Ray Liotta was the strongest in male support. A hilarious but also very controls and strict performance. Not to under appreciate Alan Alda who did very well, too. But Liotta outshone him.\nAll in all a fantastic piece of character cinema that will play with your emotions. It starts right away with the opening montage and ends with ... well you will see. And should see.",

            "content": "Greetings again from the darkness. Nicole has already made her decision. The film opens with her and husband Charlie in a therapy session. They are listing traits they admire about the other person. Watching this, we are unsure if the therapist thinks this exercise might salvage a broken marriage, or if it's some cruel way of highlighting what is being lost. This is writer-director Noah Baumbach's most gut-wrenching film to date, and it's based, at least partially, on his split from wife Jennifer Jason Leigh. Writing about personal experience is nothing new for Baumbach, as THE SQUID AND THE WHALE was inspired by his parents' divorce.Charlie (Adam Driver) is an up-and-coming theatre director in New York City, and wife Nicole (Scarlett Johansson) is the company's lead actor. When Nicole informs Charlie that she wants a divorce, and is headed back home to Los Angeles to be with family and resume her TV acting career, he is stunned. She explains that her dreams and ambitions have been stifled by focusing on his career, and despite her numerous attempts to discuss this, he has never bothered to take her seriously. Oh, and she's taking their young son Henry (Azhy Robertson) with her.What follows is a masterclass in writing, acting, directing, editing, and human nature. We watch as Nicole builds the foundation of her new life, while Charlie is staggered - not so much in denial, as disbelief. Their initial course of an amicable split, equitable division of belongings, and shared/split custody of Henry is abruptly altered when Nicole takes counsel from powerhouse LA divorce attorney Nora Fanshaw. Complicating matters is the bi-coastal nature of the divorce and California laws. This forces Charlie to meet with attorney Bert Spitz (a terrific Alan Alda), who may or may not be up to the task - his acumen varying from day to day.Baumbach allows both sides to play out. These are basically normal, good people in a situation that brings out the worst traits in both. Unsparing pain arises at every turn. One particular argument between Charlie and Nicole is the axis on which the movie turns. It's a spilling of guts and filled with devastating honesty. The scene is relentless and builds to a breakdown or breakthrough ... any description leaves us spent. Just when we don't believe we can handle any more emotional turmoil, up pops a moment of genuine tenderness that restores our faith - even if it's only long enough for us to breathe again. There are even some surprisingly funny (dark humor) moments sprinkled throughout, just as there is in life.Supporting roles are filled beautifully by Ray Liotta, Julie Hagerty, Merritt Weaver and Wallace Shawn. As Henry, Azhy Robertson avoids the \"cute-kid\" syndrome and delivers an actual nuanced performance by a child actor. Although it seems they are both everywhere these days, Ms. Johansson and Mr. Driver are truly outstanding in their roles here. Scarlet perfectly captures a woman moving on, while Adam singing Stephen Sondheim's \"Being Alive\" at the bar in front of his theatre company is one of the most poignant on screen moments of the year.There have been some amazing movies about marriage/divorce over the years. Bergman's SCENES FROM A MARRIAGE (1974), Benton's KRAMER VS KRAMER (1979), and Farhadi's A SEPARATION (2011) come to mind. Baumbach's latest belongs in that group. Even the \"best\" divorces - those where both sides end up better off - are a \"loss\" for both parties. At a minimum, it's a loss of a once-in-time vision of life partnership. The division of assets is a cold term for the shredding of emotions. We are fine with whatever the adults decide as long as the priority for both is their young son who shouldn't pay the price for their debacle ... but certainly will, just as countless other children have. I'm only now able to write about this film after seeing it at the inaugural North Texas Film Festival (NTXFF). As a movie lover, I'm in awe of the acting and storytelling. As a human being, it temporarily destroyed me.",

No please do not get me wrong, this is NOT a thriller/suspense film, rather a film for every couple/married couple, so easy to relate, and end of it we are left with an incomplete feeling of wanting the couple to reconcile.The film starts with a monologue from the protagonist, it's a turn off for me and I was skeptical about the film to have all the cliche ingredients to establish the principle characters and the proceedings of this film. Surprisingly the treatment is way matured here, and from thereon the film takes us to their world where we as a viewer relate, decide and analyze every other decision the couple take to separate.The film obviously drives into 2 perspectives and this eventually builds up the differences/frustrations/confusions among the couple during the course slowly yet steadily without losing grip on the narrative. To add more vigor to the conflict, there are court room sequences wherein the couple realizes that this is getting out of control and this is the point where the characters transform.Even the inert love for each other is portrayed with such undertones that these characters evolve as real characters and we relate to this particular phase the characters are placed in to.A film which has fantastic performances by the lead characters, the pacing of the film was very well thought of, since the genre of drama takes a slag during climax to fuse overdose of emotional baggage, that is not the case with Marriage Story. The climax is so subtle and it ends on a proper note retain the journey as realistic as it could get,Marriage Story - Highly Recommended!!",

The film as a whole is amazing and worth watching because it's unlike anything you'll ever see. Driver and Johansen and clear frontrunners for best actor and actress respectively and truly deserve it. The depiction of a divorce was so raw and real, and that's were this film excels in the sense that the film feels real. You experience every emotion of sorrow and heartbreak to anger and hatred.

The most impressive thing to me, personally, is how easy the film is to watch even though the subject matter is so tragic and heart breaking............you genuinely feel for both of them. However that is helped by the incredible acting in this film!You know a film is good when it even reaches an audience or demographic it isn't intended for............that would be me! Who would have thought that a single/unmarried male in his twenties would really enjoy and like this film? I didn't before seeing it. But the critic reviews and buzz around the film meant it was almost unavoidable with the Oscars coming around soon. I couldn't believe that I'd end up actually like this film let alone really enjoying it. The main reason is because its a human story but you as the audience are watching it from the outside...........so it doesn't necessarily need to be relatable for you to understand or get it. Like this sort of situation is a million miles away from my personally life and at what stage I'm in my life. However even though it wasn't relatable to me in away way shape or form it was just so easy and riveting to watch.There are three individuals as to why this film works so well. Firstly Noah Baumbach just a brilliantly directed but more impressively written film. There are some really long and dialogue heavy scenes in this film, which must have been a nightmare to do, but it flows so well in the story and the characters portrayed. Oscar nod for both.....probably. Talking of the characters portrayed, Adam Driver and Scarlet Johansson are just both simply incredible!!! There are no others words for them both, you could be witnessing career defining moments for both of them!! Award nods for both of them is a lock..............I would be shocked if they didn't because I think they both deserve to win!! All I'm gonna say is that there is an argument scene.........wow just wow, some incredibly emotional acting.Overall to be honest I am quite stunned that I ended up really liking this film because this is not my type of genre of film and I am certainly not the demographic for this film. So for those reasons alone there are no excuses as to why anyone shouldn't see this film!! Absolutely brilliant from Noah Baumbach but I think his work is overshadowed by his actors in Driver and Johansson respectively. 80% out of 100 its a really really damn good film that anyone can watch and enjoy!",

Not with fireworks, but with divorce papers, custody battles, and costly meetings where, sometimes, the two partners are truly taught to hate each other. This, according to Tim Grierson, is what Baumbach tells us of the \"Divorce-Industrial Complex\".This is the sort of movie that many will berate in that it is insufficiently glamorous and escapist, the way movie-films \"should be\" (it features hot celebs in unflattering, very human scenarios). But I'd say the perfect medicine for those who want life to be like the movies is a movie that's like life. Or at least, how life may turn out if two people fail in their devotion, or are told that they did; to quote Grierson, \"the happiest people in this movie are the divorce attorneys\".Adam Driver and Scarlett Johansson are undoubtedly the biggest selling point of the project, knocking it out of the park as stage director Charles and his actress wife Nicole, going through a messy divorce that forces them to travel coast-to-coast. They are surrounded by the likes of Laura Dern, Alan Alda, Ray Liotta, and even Wallace Shawn for a little while. All of these legends do well enough that I routinely forgot I was watching a film, rather than a documented ordeal.Particularly noteworthy, however, is the actor playing the couple's son. Too often, unconvincing child performers are dismissed as \"just kids\", ergo we shouldn't complain that they aren't as engaging or engaged as the adult actors - many of them veterans, to boot. Azhy Robertson comes close, however. We shouldn't ignore films like this, just as we shouldn't ignore Room and Looper.marriage storeThe movie may sound dispiriting and sad as I have described it (for some, this will be therapeutic and remind them that they're not alone), but be aware that it treats a difficult scenario with a certain sense of humor. Another ostensibly depressing film I saw this year was About Endlessness, by the great Swedish auteur Roy Andersson, which was about a larger number of upsetting aspects of human life.All the same, it was technically a comedy; not pointing and laughing at the subjects, but having a sense of humor about the harsh parts of existence. Baumbach, with his commentary on divorce agencies and his lifelike characters, is ultimately more serious than Roy Andersson, although we're still permitted to laugh about the messiness of it all, the way the central couple one day might. Marriage Story affirms that a romantic comedy can be more - so very much more - than the inoffensive pop entertainment we often assume rom-coms ought to be.Much like The Irishman, this is another acclaimed film to get the \"limited theatrical run followed by immediate Netflix release\" treatment, further legitimizing the trend-spotting paper I wrote on the future of cinema this spring. More and more respected filmmakers are taking streaming seriously (see also Roma and The Ballad of Buster Scruggs of last year's Oscar Bait season), but I certainly believe Marvel premiere events will keep certain film theatres alive. Some theatres might also survive due to having screenings of old classics for devoted cinephiles to attend, but those types might find a substitute in the Criterion Channel.Of course, it's also nice that instant online release allows me to catch more of the well-liked movies in a year and then run my mouth about them to no-one in particular. I think we'll see Baumbach at the Oscars.",

This movie is long excessively sentimental, mostly boring tale of divorced parents each seeking custody of their child.2 Though an year late, I wanted to see the film for the much awarded acting of Laura Dern. I wasn't disappointed. She plays a lawyer with elan, poise and chutzpah besides being stylishly articulated.3 It is hugely reminiscent of the classic\n\" Kramer vs Kramer \" which had set up high standards for this type of storyline. This film is however nowhere near.4. Director Noah Baumbach must have known that his film will invariablely be compared to \" Kramer vs Kramer\" and fall short of expectations.5. A thought crossed my mind that in such cases the child suffers the most of mental trauma.On an impulse I decided to see \" Kramer vs Kramer \" again before writing this review. Man, what a movie!But back to this movie. The acting of all 3 Adam Driver, Scarlet Johansson and Laura Dern is quite good. Adam is particularly impressive when he breaks down after an argument. They are however let down by a weak screenplay which lacks pace and punch. It's all about incompatibility in couples and this must be unconvincing to the huge number of married professionals happy with their lives. But Adam is no Dustin Hoffman and Scarlett is no Meryl Streep to pull it off realistically. No doubt the legal jargon fits in well but the oversentimenality spoils it. No tugging at the heart strings seen in any scene.",

            "content": "Charlie (Adam Driver) & Nicole (Scarlett Johansson) are a married couple who have finally given up on each other and agree to get a divorce. No matter what they do to correct the once happy marriage (including counselling) the end results remain the same. Marriage Story allows us to witness the lifestyle and personal challenges that come to both Charlie and Nicole as they question the future for themselves and their only son. Things become even more tense and dramatic when both partners seek out lawyers in the pursuit of custody of their son.When I first heard that actors Adam Driver and Scarlett Johansson were playing a married couple on screen I couldn't imagine how that would work. But as I began watching the film, I couldn't get over how convincing the two are as a married couple. The two show great chemistry which thankfully is kept consistent throughout the entire film. Even when the two are arguing or disagreeing, you can actually feel that the two people are connected and were once married. Marriage Story easily has some of the greatest performances of 2019 and not just from the leads. It also provided a top notch supporting cast who were surprisingly entertaining whenever they appeared. Some of the supporting cast actors included Laura Dern, Ray Liotta & Alan Alda who all played lawyers throughout the film. Each actor, just like the leads, was solid and extremely convincing in all areas.Another key strength is the dialogue and script. It's quick, snappy and on top of that, it just feels so real. Considering this is classed as a drama I never found myself bored during the story. The way the actor's delivered scripted lines sometimes even comes across as fun amidst the dramatic moments. It's quite surprising the way this film juggles between the positive moments as well as the sad ones as we watch everything going on with Charlie and Nicole.Marriage Story is well directed and has a good audio track as well as visuals. At no point did the shots disappoint me or feel out of place. Everything here is enjoyable and comfortable to view for the whole duration. The film has done a great job at providing small transitions between selected scenes which can make it feel like a stage play. Another fun effect is the use of jazz tunes to uplift the tone of the film after a tense moment.In a nutshell Marriage Story is surprisingly enjoyable considering the film's themes and topic. Even if you think this type of film isn't relatable to you, I still highly recommend it. The film's performances are absolutely surprising and had I seen this in a cinema, I would have stood up and applauded it.9.6/10\nWalkden Entertainment",

It is raw and real, it hits you hard and effectively. The only message Marriage Story is trying to convey is that, divorce is horrible, stay away from it.Noah Baumbach has created this film with utter perfection. It is a very personal film for him since it is somewhat based on his own divorce. He took it seriously and created a masterpiece. Marriage Story features two of the finest performances of this year and maybe, even of this decade. Scarlet Johansson and Adam Driver are heartbreaking. They make you laugh with them, they make you sob with them. In that \"Argument\" scene, and you'll hear about this scene very often for a while, because it is incredible. The finest piece of filmmaking, it is so real and natural and emotional, I was having a hard time while watching it. It was heart-rending, thanks to Adam and Scarlet for their impeccable acting.Marriage Story does not start as an alluring tale of love and then goes to a sad mode. It starts with melancholy and ends with melancholy. In very beginning of the movie, there's that scene when Nicole and Charlie are having a normal chat post-sepration decision, they're talking about this theatre play of theirs and as soon as Nicole leaves Charlie's sight, she crumbles, break into tears and that was painful to watch. That is my personal favorite scene from the movie. There's one monologue about six minutes log, all in one take, where Scarlet Johansson is touching every possible emotion, she's walking, crying, sniffing, sobbing, eating, giving complements about what she eats, I don't know how many take it too her but this is a remarkable achievement. I've never rated Scarlet Johansson very high as an actress but she surprised me here and same goes for Adam Driver.Noah Baumbach made this film around a divorce, a very poignant situation. But there's no melodrama or other gimmicks, it is just so natural and real. These two people are against each other, but Noah approached this story with a very neutral eye. No one is the villain here, this man and woman are equally responsible for what they are going through. Noah does not want you to judge but rather empathize these characters.Film's screenplay is very well written, despite not being a high octane thriller, this sophisticated drama keeps you tied up with the seat. Screenplay gives you some light hearted moments, moments you'll laugh at. Unexpectedly this is quite funny when it wants to be.Marriage Story is going to be a front-runner in every department this coming Oscars season, I loved Joaquin Phoenix in joker and thought he could be a sure shot winner, but now I think it's not going to be that easy.",

The smallest conflicts and contradictions in life make me say the most vicious words to my loved ones. We have opposite words, even though it is not me Deliberately, but when the trivial life breaks through the sanity we have maintained, when the conflict between the two gradually deepens the evil words, at this time, the most terrible self usually hides behind. Life is just such a story without much modification, but often full of sadness. When Charlie finally saw Nicole's letter, they still loved each other so much. Then all words turned into tears in the corners of the eyes, but now we realize that it is too late! In the seemingly ordinary 'marriage relationship', the film injects thoughts and questions about sexual relations. It's really hard to see such a movie telling a heartbreaking divorce story in such a gentle way. Should we really think about when and why did we become hysterical? It 's not just a wonderful story. The performances of Adam Dreyfus and Scarlett have added a lot to this film. I even saw my shadow from Charlie in the future. A really good movie is so much without praise. The most real emotions are needed to let the audience in front of the screen think about themselves and their lives. This may be the greatness of the movie as the seventh art! \"I saw him in love with him within two seconds, I will never Will stop loving him, although these are not important now \"",

            "content": "Last night I watched the first twenty minutes of Marriage Story. I love everyone involved in the movie so expectations were very high. But immediately, (IMMEDIATELY) the intrusive, BUSY musical score started to drive a nail into my head. Here were two monologues; letters written by the lead characters about each other. They were smart (if a little precious) and heartfelt and full of nice details. However, the entire time Adam Driver and Scarlett Johansson were speaking, this wall to wall orchestra kept sawing away, frolicking and gamboling like a Rossini overture underlining the moments with 'whimsy' and the promise of 'heartache.' Like a bright yellow highlight pen, the music left no room for independent thought: I was being told exactly how to feel about every second.But I got through the opening bits; although I didn't quite buy any of the director/actor theatre scenes- Why is that no one ever seems to be able to capture the truth of what it's like to do small theatre? Those ridiculous rehearsal scenes were painful in their ostentatious inauthenticity...and don't get me started on the actual performance of the play. It was almost exactly like that old SNL sketch \"Bad Conceptual Theatre\" - If only Dan Aykroyd had stepped out as Leonard Pinth Garnell to give a review - Even more hilarious was the discovery in a later scene that this awful slice of \"high art\" was slated for Broadway. In what universe?But I stuck with it until the scene where Scarlett Johansson reminds her husband that she finds it difficult to cry onstage only to walk into her bedroom and burst into tears. This is a moment that should've wrecked me. It's beautifully set up, and would have been totally unexpected and rending. But at she walks through the hallway towards her bedroom, the score whips up into a Soap Opera ready string-filled cry of anguish so generic it could have been used for that old Carol Burnett sketch As The Stomach Turns. The camera pulls in to show Scarlett's tear-filled face - but any empathy is immediately sucker-punched to the ground by the hideously OVER THE TOP music.Cut to: this morning as I scanned through the Golden Globe Nominations. Not only is that exercise in bathos and banality actually nominated for Best Original Score... It was written by none other than Randy Newman. If I make it through the movie it will be with the sound off and the subtitles on. I like to decide how I feel about things. I don't need to be smothered in kisses to know I am loved. And I don't need to be swaddled in a treacly, syrupy, honey-laden, jokey, telegraphing soundscape in order to understand that sadness or joy are on display. I'm pretty sure I'm smarter than that. My CATS are definitely smarter than that. It's no coincidence that Bennett coughed up three yards of hairball during the first thirty seconds of the movie.",

That's why the description of this film on IMDB does not make any sense: \"Noah Baumbach's incisive and compassionate look at a marriage breaking up and a family staying together.\" When a couple decides to end their marriage, they throw their family to the garbage. This film is a homage to divorce, and that's why I didn't like it.Although with stunning performances, the film is entirely depressing. Why they call it a comedy-drama is a mystery to me. I didn't laugh even once. The message of the film? Don't fight for your love, destroy your marriage, scratch your spouse's eyes and wreck you children's lives.I'm sorry, but I think that to stay together and try to reconnect after a crisis requires a lot of braveness, courage, infinite love and forgiveness. I believe in fighting for your love and not in separation. And when you've decided to have kids, separation can't even be an option. Unless you are in a highly dysfunctional marriage (abuse, drugs, persistence infidelity), grow up and work on your marriage. Divorce is a failure. Stop treating it like something that is OK. Children carry the scars of divorce all their lives, and couples lose for ever the opportunity of reconnecting and growing. Since 50% of the people who marry today get bored after a while and seek divorce, I'm sure my review will not be liked, but I don't care.Some say this film could be Woody's. Of course not! Woody Allen's films are a 1,000 times more brilliant and deep that these 2 hours of depressing boredom. Others compare this film to Kramer vs. Kramer. Also not. Kramer vs. Kramer, although talks about divorce too, is a very deep and good film.The music of Marriage Story, BTW, is really annoying. The direction, meh.

The ambition and unselfconscious self-obsession of Adam Driver's character is shared by Dustin Hoffman's in the earlier film. But Scarlett Johansson's character is allowed not to feel as guilty as Meryl Streep's for believing that she could be a better mother if she could be a whole person. Baumbach gives Laura Dern, Ray Liotta and Alan Alda very good speeches as a trio of lawyers explaining how the courts will stitch the opposing parties up.There are some funny lines and one really excellent scene in which the leads tear into each other, no holds barred. But it's Driver's raw delivery of a Sondheim song that will probably impress most.I wish I'd've liked it more, but in the end the travails of those in Mr Baumbach's navel-gazing world are not perhaps as universal as he might like to think.",

The answer is that it's just a normal story of a family divorcing, and the parents trying to work it out with their child. The whole entire story is sort of depressing, because it focuses on the breaking of a family that was once strong. The first few minutes of the film start off with good vibes, but the rest is just full of hate, and dealing with their son and who wants to spend more time with their son. It's a simple idea, but nobody has ever been brave enough to show a story like this in a film, that's what makes it unique. It dives into the feelings that the parents have and the innocence of the child throughout this process. Another aspect of why this movie was so good, was the directing. Directing in small ways can really make or break a film, it defines what a film is and it can turn it into a piece of art. Throughout the film, there were several monologues that were crucial to the storyline and very emotional. As these were taking place, the camera would slowly zoom in, or it would not change its view to give the audience an outside look at what this character was really struggling with. The final piece of this movie that defined it for me was the acting. Both Adam Driver and Scarlatti Johansson were incredible. I was surprised because Laura Dern also did a great job. They all made us feel their emotion and made us want to help them in some way, it was truly amazing. A very unique experience.",

            "content": "And the Oscar goes to...\nPretty well everyone involved: leads Scarlett Johansson and Adam Driver, supporting actors Laura Dern and Alan Alda, director writer Noah Baumbach. Award spoilers aside, there's a damn startling movie here. Hollywood has tackled divorce often, and fumbled, until now. Eschewing the staid good guy vs. bad guy conflict, Baumbach zeroes in on a wonderful and lively young family, coming apart in a slow, spreading crack, that despite all good intentions, just keeps growing like a Roadrunner cartoon.\"Marriage Story\" is an infuriatingly frustrating tale of characters who click as a couple, bubble with natural chemistry, yet can't quite transition past their early, blinding, love-in stage, when redefining transition is absolutely crucial. A universal conflict this. Driver and Johansson are exquisitely real in their roles, wrapping each other in delicious camaraderie, stepping out of comfort zones to seek solutions, snapping pettiness in conflict, crumbling at frustration. Can't help but cheer for their bliss, and tear up at their unravelling. Emotional roller coasters don't come much hairier.Baumbach isn't afraid to poke, prod and twist deep into messy psyches on a journey revealing the complexities of human nature. Even in turmoil, amidst the vitriol, sometimes there is revelation. The lesson here: a lot of relationships unfurl because individuals crave their freedom, is a tough one because there isn't a magic solution, and sometimes happens. Also: lawyers are the worst.A tough but worthwhile watch.",

Literally it seemed to happen overnight.\nAlso, I wasn't expecting a film called \"Marriage Story\" to be about a divorce, but of course it was about a marriage leading to divorce.\nI also want to comment on some of the reviews I've read here by male viewers. Several of them seem to feel that Charlie, Adam Driver's character, got the raw end of the deal in the film. One reviewer even referred to the \"gynocentric world\" we live in. This made me realize something: that it's in the area of children that women for the most part have an advantage. Perhaps it's the only area in which this is true. How anyone could call our world \"gynocentric\" when women have been oppressed and still are for centuries all around the world. shows a male ignorance of the particularly heinous type. But it was kind of heartening to realize that yes, there is one area of life in which women do have an advantage, or edge.\nThe film is worth seeing if you want an emotional experience because it does deliver that.

            "content": "It's no secret that behind the benign title, Noah Baumbach's newest is really a 'Divorce Story' (I suppose it makes it more marketable and palatable on a marquee). After a somewhat rosy prologue we truly meet our New York City couple: Nicole (Scarlet Johannson), a 30 something Actress who started out in Hollywood. Charlie (Adam Driver), a 30 something theater Director who uses Nicole as his muse. They are in a therapy session trying to avert a Divorce, but, it's clear from the outset that it's inevitable.From that start point, the film (shot on 35mm) progresses on pretty much a steady plain - Arguments. Accusations. The woman moving out (back to L.A.). The hiring of Divorce attorneys. The attorneys argue. Etc. etc. Also, another predictable element: The cute kid (Henry played by Azhy Robertson) caught in the tug of war in between. Is \"Henry\" a nod to KRAMER VS. KRAMER's Justin Henry? (there's also a not so subtle nod to Ingmar Bergman's SCENES FROM A MARRIAGE tucked in)\nWhat keeps the film flowing is the fine performances of Johannson and Driver. I've usually found Driver to be too diffident to be really effective, but, here, he delivers his strongest acting yet. Johansson has always been appealing, and is more than fine here. The Supporting cast is also fine including Laura Dern, Alan Alda and Ray Liotta as the trio of lawyers involved in the case, Merrit Wever as Nicole's sister, and a pleasant surprise in seeing Julie Hagerty as her mom (didn't even recognize her as it's been years since I've seen her in anything even if she has been semi-active).Still, as effective as the ensemble is, and as punchy a script as Baumbach has written can be at times, the film's arc comes off as a bit flat. Other than flashbacks, we never get to really see the true dynamics of the marriage. The pair too often come off as self-absorbed narcissists (not uncommon in Baumbach's writing). They say they are mismatched, but are they really? It wouldn't be a stretch to think that some viewers will say that they 'deserve each other'. The principle argument seems to be over whether they should base in L.A. or New York, rather than something catastrophically wrong in their relationship.Now, it's also no secret that Baumbach has based his screenplay partly on his own divorce from Actress Jennifer Jason Leigh. That very public split also involved Baumbach's affair (and now full relationship) with actress Greta Gerwig (there's even a nod to her Directing nomination). But, MARRIAGE STORY softens that critical detail, and that's unfortunate. Not because a filmmaker should air their dirty laundry on screen*, but, because with that crucial event (or something akin), the story seems not only incomplete but it also makes the couple seem even more selfish. To substitute, Baumbach has included a knock down drag out argument between the pair where they vent and vent and vent. Like much of the movie, it's well acted, but, still has a certain hollowness at its core.MARRIAGE STORY is a rare adult film in a sea of lite entertainment. The acting is extremely good, and worth seeing for it. But, they are let down by the less than candid characters.* See Woody Allen's HUSBANDS AND WIVES for a more honest take",

Marriage story however maintains the perfect middle ground, opting to not chose sides, but rather grant us as the viewer an impartial look into a failed marriage and all the messiness therein, combining both the bitter and the sweet to devastating effect.First off this film would be nothing without the power of its actors, all of which are in top form, further supported by a great script and very competent filmmaking from director Noah Baumbach overall. Johansson and Driver are both gutwretching as their rollercoaster divorce darts back and fourth between friendly and ferocious, culminating in one scene which can perhaps rival the best of any fight scenes between couples I've ever witnessed on screen. Even with all that being said, the film never loses the tenderness at its core. The only issue I can even think to have with Marriage Story is that everything is perhaps a little too neatly and quickly wrapped up in the last 15 minutes or so. But with it sporting around a two hour run time, this is hardly a big issue.By the end, it's hard not to feel put through the ringer with Marriage Story, but we may also be thankful for it. It serves as a painful reminder of the impermanence the very things we want to have stick around most in life possess, and how what we once loved so much can get so far away from us in no time at all. I've seen few films portray this as brilliantly as Marriage Story, and if you're able to take what it can dish, this one is a must see.",

Good films that show a realistic portrayal of a breakdown in a marriage and the subsequent divorce are few and far between.The Oscar winning Kramer vs Kramer was 40 years ago. The black comedy The War of the Roses was 30 years ago.Based on director's Noah Baumbach's own experiences of getting divorced. Charlie (Adam Driver) is a New York theatre director. His wife Nicole (Scarlett Johansson) is an actress who has recently moved back to Los Angeles to make a television series and taken their son Henry with her.Although the couple agreed to divorce amicably without involving lawyers. Nicole then hires a hotshot divorce lawyer in LA, Nora Fanshaw (Laura Dern) who tells Nicole thaty being LA based would be advantageous for Nicole. In turn Charlie lawyers up. First he goes to a veteran attorney Bert Spitz (Alan Alda) whose advice seems to vary a lot but at least he sees the need to come to an agreement. Charlie then goes for the more pumped up and expensive Jay Marotta (Ray Liotta) and both sides end up slinging mud at each other.I suppose most of the male audience will sympathise with Charlie and would be more willing to see events from his point of view. He is an up and coming theatre director with a show moving to Broadway. Charlie is confused as to why Nicole has gone legalistic. He fears losing contact with his son, he realises the expense of getting divorced and that he will end up footing the bill.Most of the female audience will sympathise with Nicole. She has fallen out of love with Charlie, she now feels held back and thinks she can do better in LA. She suspects Charlie might have had an affair.I watched the movie with my wife and she certainly sided with Nicole.Marriage Story is a mature and intelligent movie. It doesn't take sides. Despite Charlie's and Nicole's best intentions of an amicable separation. They then repeat the same mistakes which thousands of other divorcing couple do the world over.There is some humour in this movie, at times it is sad and raw.

That is, what the audience sees could actually be what you see in real life. Theater is usually directed in very dramatic absurd ways to reflect and heighten the emotional drama the character is going through. This movie combines 2 styles in a jarring way.\nAlso, the movie should be called \"not meant for each other, and problems in communicating\", because 1) they aren't a good match for each other. They'd be much happier if they had chosen other people to partner up, and 2) if she had been more incisive with what she wanted (job and city), and he had been more precise with what he meant (didn't make it dubious, leading her on), they would've reached an understanding which wouldn't have led them down this path.\nAlso, this movie is at least 1h longer than it needs to be. And the characters are bland and boring. Also, this is very chick-flicky, as she is being a B*** and doesn't get called on her BS (no sex, hacking computer, lying about the city change being temporary, lying about no lawyers, lying about custody, being jealous of the attention he's getting, making the dad be the bad father by giving too many presents to the kid, and not making the boy keep his responsabilities, drinking everyday, going to parties while he works, having sex with random people, taking the couch, relying on her mother for life expenses, while he doesn't have a parent to help him out, getting 2 dream jobs and an award, etc) (while he has to switch cities, spend a lot of money to pay for all the law suit, buy an apartment, guard her house, make the child be responsible, gets little love from wife and son, etc).",

            "content": "Under the direction of Noah Baumbach, the highly acclaimed love drama \"Marriage Story\" was created in 2019 and won an Academy Award for best supporting actress (Laura Dern). At first it seems that the focus is just on two great actors, but \"Marriage Story\" is so much more ...Nicole and Charlie Barber are married, have a son, love the theater and want to get a divorce. The lives of both artists have changed and instead of clarifying the matter personally, Nicole hires a lawyer who makes the whole thing all the more complicated and difficult ...A story that may not have much to offer on paper but is one of the most moving dramas in recent years. A film rarely feels so real and pure. But the enchanting thing about \"Marriage Story\" is that despite the divorce, there is a lot of romance and love to be seen in the film ... just in a different way. Adam Driver himself describes the film as a love film, despite the divorce issue. On the other hand, \"Marriage Story\" shows how scary such a divorce can be, even without the painful emotions! The lawyers do the talking, almost like in kindergarten, and you feel helpless. The film shows this helplessness in a real, but disturbing way. Nevertheless, despite the many difficult and sometimes tearsome topics, Baumbach manages to build wit and good humor into the story.Scarlett Johansson and Adam Driver are the acting heart of this film. Laura Dern, Ray Liotta and the other supporting actors are all great, but it is Johansson and Driver who make \"Marriage Story\" what it is. Both have an incredible amount of chemistry and can shine with some great monologues. Nobody is the \"bad guy\", both are people with strengths and weaknesses and all actions of the two are understandable, which makes the arguments between the two so much more powerful.Visually, the film does not impress with a breathtaking look, but the camera work by Robbie Ryan is very strong and often holds without cuts on the faces of the protagonists. Randy Newman's music also fits surprisingly well.Conclusion: A must-see! \"Marriage Story\" is a rather unimpressive film compared to other masterpieces this year, but Noah Baumbach's film is moving, funny and sometimes hard to bear. And Scarlett Johansson and Adam Driver play Oscar-worthy!",

            "content": "The good acting of the cast aside, this movie is disgusting. Let me say this now: infidelity in marriage is NEVER acceptable. What Charlie did, regardless of how unfair he thinks he's being treated in terms of not receiving his wife's affection is nowhere even remotely close to justification.That being said: this film's portrayal of a messy divorce is one-sided and clearly pushing an agenda.Let's ignore the flat cinematography, the pedestrian editing, and the dialog written by a 20 year old art student major and consider the fact this film is clearly pushing an agenda. Nicole lies, helps commit a crime, and manipulates Charlie because of her own sense of entitlement for some misguided sense of \"empowerment.\" At the same time, Charlie is treated as a inept moron without her. The production company they have praises Nicole incessantly because of (no joke) her suggestion of arm placement for a performance. It is also custody propaganda where the idea of women wiping out a man's entire livelihood is justified because \"men are accepted for their flaws where women are not.\" Are you kidding me? What ridiculous nonsense. It's as if the writer behind this dumpster thinks their own misandry is justification for every horrible act committed against a man.This is ridiculous. The parody of the fight scene in social media between the two is the least of this film's problems. Women DOMINATE in divorce proceedings, and (as somebody who have seen family members go through divorce) the men are disproportionately punished in the proceedings. If this was an out-and-out \"man bad, woman good, she gets custody and everything is right with the world\" story, that would be one thing. However, this is trying to come across as an ambiguous tale when this woman clearly chooses to lie to her husband, make him suffer, destroy every aspect of his life, and use her son like a prop in her machinations. And the film treats this as justified, and it is rather sickening.Art doesn't need to conform to your sensibilities of morality. It doesn't need to make you feel happy. The acting is great, no one can deny this. However, in the world of brutal litigation in divorce proceedings, this film is quite abhorrent in how the message appears to encourage pre-emptive, brutal, and vindictive actions to cause the most amount of suffering is rewarded in full. What an appalling piece of dreck.",

            "content": "This was a very disturbing, depressing, and difficult to watch eye-opener movie from Noah Baumbach. So this IS what divorce in real life looks like and FEELS like? I felt HORRIBLE by just watching it; I cannot imagine what it must feel like to be the people going through a _______. Thank these parents for sparing the kid's feelings and psychological well-being because if they had not they would have traumatized him for life.After the movie ended and the credits were rolling and \"Shouting and Shopping\" by Randy Newman was playing, I was just in a daze. It is never claimed in the movie, but this film must definitely be based on real life events, most likely on Noah's own _______.My own thoughts on the couple:\nThis marriage was never meant to last because each party wanted a different line of work in a different coast of the U.S. from years before they ever even met. One party got their way meaning that the other party gave in. One party was completely selfish and self-centered and focused only on their career goals, and completely failed to see and allow the other party to pursue their career goals. The other party was very selfless and VERY patient for as long as humanely possible until it was no longer humanely possible to forget their career goals.They should have never fallen in love with each other since both parties wanted completely different lines of work in completely opposite parts of the U.S., but unfortunately they did since love can strike anywhere and anytime when you least expect it and cannot be controlled.And to make matters worse, they made a third party that tied them together.I sided with one party thinking they had been patient and selfless and felt disgusted by the other party who had been so selfish and self-centered from day one and not only that but completely failed to see the other party's wishes and desires even after such party explicitly spelled them out for them.But I also realized that this marriage was never supposed to work in the first place since both wanted completely different lines of work in completely opposite sides of the country. They should not have married and made a third party. But LOVE can strike anywhere and anytime when you least expect it, so this marriage story could not be helped.Moral of this story: do not fall in love with someone that wants to work in something completely different on the other side of the country.I watched this movie knowing absolutely NOTHING about it. I knew it was a Netflix movie and that it got an Oscar, but that is it. So the whole plot was a complete shock to me.Conclusion: very difficult emotional film to watch; it surely is based on real life events and it portrayed well how horrible a _______ is. I learned a valuable lesson or two for the future.10/10",

            "content": "The divorce attorney gets his first look at the Barber file. In trial, he'll use the term \"avant-garde\" with authority, but in the interim, Jay Mirotta(Ray Liotta) needs Charlie(Adam Driver) to explain what \"Exit Goat\" means. It's the name of the client's repertory theater back in NYC. He's the director. Nicole(Scarlett Johansson), his wife, was the actor. Born and bred in Los Angeles, Nicole returns home to shoot a pilot for network television. The filmmaker, avoiding the trope of the runaway mother, something new to an audience in 1979, who couldn't believe the audacity and gall of Meryl Streep's character, Joanna Kramer, when she leaves her son behind, has Henry(Azry Robertson) join Nicole on his mother's personal journey of self-discovery. \"Marriage Story\", directed by Noah Baumbach, rehabilitates Joanna Kramer, but not in a ham-fisted manner that puts Nicole on a pedestal at the expense of demonizing Charlie for the sins of Ted Kramer's chauvinism. The wife, too has the same temperament, and ego, of an artist, as the husband. Back in California, back in the nest, her childhood home, Charlie is served, when he fails at wrangling his wife back on the east coast. After putting Henry to sleep, the father stands in the hallway, looking at pictures of a shared life, now jeopardized by the fraughtness of temporality. Sandra(Julie Haggerty), Nicole's mother(a former television star), framed, too, the clipping of a magazine article entitled \"Scenes From a Marriage\", which highlights their lives as personal and professional partners. Noah Baumbach, of course, is a Woody Allen acolyte, a synonym for Ingmar Bergman fan.The opening montage can be interpreted as a Swedish nutshell; it's the 397-minute original version of the Bergman film as prologue. \"Exit Goat\" could just as well be the title of the 1974 film starring Liv Ullman and Erland Johansson about a man who leaves his wife for a younger woman. In \"Marriage Story\", Nora(Laura Dern), Nicole's legal representation, rants about the double standard, regarding the expectations of a mother and father in child custody battles. A kibosh is put on the court proceeding rehearsal after Nicole provides answers that are overtly honest to questions that Nora's assistant peppers her with for the upcoming court date, when the former Ms. Charlie Barber has to sit in the witness chair and endure a crossfire of questions meant to denigrate her character. \"Let's face it, the idea of a good father was only invented like 30 years ago,\" Nora asserts, referencing Dustin Hoffman as the ad executive who tugged at people's heartstrings when he fails at making French toast for his distraught, abandoned son in \"Kramer vs. Kramer\". Johan, a mediocre academic, in \"Scenes From A Marriage\", announces to his wife that he'll be taking an eight month sabbatical from his teaching post at a backwater college, in order to be with his new girlfriend on an extended Paris holiday without apology. Nora is spot-on. The professor shirks his responsibilities of fatherhood. It's up to Marianne to break the news to their two young daughters. Watching Johan's callous disregard for anybody's feelings but his own, the audience realizes with a start that the obligatory scene we've grown so accustomed to, the one in which the parents have a sit-down with the kids(like in Baumbach's \"The Squid and the Whale), an anxiety-reducing assurance in the form of a heart-to-heart conversation about how parental love is unconditional and indefatigable, has a relatively short history. In \"Kramer vs. Kramer\", the mother practically flees, leaving Billy(Justin Henry), as he slumbers unaware before dawn's break. Joanna Kramer shocked America. Men do this, not women. Even worse, Joanna tells her son, an eight-year-old boy, in a letter, no less, that she has found being his mother to be an unfulfilling experience.Charlie, a New York transplant, came from humble stock, the heartland. His wife describes him as being \"self-made\", whereas the California native, it should be noted, was born into privilege, the daughter of showbiz parents, who, in essence, chose slumming. when she gave up a lucrative movie career to do \"weird theater\". Nicole was already a rising star before she crossed paths with Charlie. \"Marriage Story\" subverts the filmic paradigm of the female student surpassing her male mentor, as seen in numerous versions of \"A Star is Born\". As archetypes go, that's not Esther Blodgett(Judy Garland), the aspiring ingenue, telling her life story on Nora Fanshaw's couch in an upscale Beverly Hills law office, it's Norman Maine(James Mason), the mentor. \"Marriage Story\" is a feminist reworking of \"A Star is Born\", putting out to pasture the old tropes about men and women in showbiz. The filmmaker gives Nicole the agency; she was the big Hollywood star whose fame gave the unknown director instant credibility. Charlie's first audiences were fanboys and fangirls who knew Nicole from \"All About the Girl\"; they bought tickets based on name recognition alone. Their fruitful collaboration, over time, remained productive, but now Charlie was the draw, Nora learns, as the client explains that she felt herself getting \"smaller\", or in other words, feeling resentful towards being usurped by Charlie, whom the wife feels, owes her the chance to direct. Since \"Marriage Story\" bills itself as a course correction for the anti-feminist stance taken in \"Kramer vs. Kramer\", who expected Joanna, a fashion designer, to give up her career and raise their son, which was, indeed, part and parcel of the arrangement, back in the day. Although Charlie should have been more supportive towards his wife's venture, arguably, and the husband knew this, being the lead actor in a successful Broadway play is the crowning achievement for anybody in Nicole's profession. That's why he can't fathom the undertaking. Without his star, the play closes immediately after its debut. What goes unsaid is that Nicole disappointed all the people she worked with. The sudden move, arguably, was a calculating one. Nicole does, in fact, know her own value, even though she tells Nora otherwise. Her departure prevents Charlie from being the toast of Broadway. Nora, in an arbitration meeting with Nicole's husband and his new lawyer, Bert Spitz(Alan Alda), lets Charlie know that she admired the off-Broadway version of the failed play, recalling the toast's aroma from her seat. Charlie, quick with the quip, responds: \"They couldn't smell the toast,\" while Bert offers his condolences. Nicole elicits a slight chuckle, relishing, perhaps, in the fact that Charlie failed on the biggest stage imaginable. \"Marriage Story\" is an aborted \"...Star...\" No star is born. The diva couldn't handle Charlie supplanting her place in the limelight, like Judy Garland(Adam Driver plays the woman's part) receiving all the hosannas from the adoring public as James Mason(Scarlett Johansson plays the man's part) watches from backstage. Nicole's greatest fear is that she'll be remembered as the actress who took her top off in a teen *** comedy romp. The filmmaker, not wanting to overplay his hand, never spells out Charlie's alleged selfishness, his obsession with wanting to remain a New York family. The husband had turned down a directing gig at the L.A.-based Geffen Theater earlier in their marriage because he knew, then and now, that it's easier for the intelligentsia to see you by maintaining the same zip code and time zone. After the divorce becomes finalized, Charlie returns to her mother's house. Nicole gloats a little, reveling in her recently-announced Emmy nomination for directing. Charlie accepts the news graciously, and lets it go unremarked that she could have been the toast of Broadway, not himself. During their torrential argument, Charlie calls her a \"hack\". It's not really a criticism; it's a fact. Nicole is unaware of her own potential for transcendence. If only they read their letters to each other at couples therapy. Charlie writes: \"She's my favorite actress.\" He respects her professionally. Nicole, on the other hand, is not nearly as generous. But that's okay. Nobody blinks if the male has the artistic temperament of an egomaniac.In \"Scenes From a Marriage\", the husband never learns that his wife had girlhood aspirations of being an actress. Johan falls asleep while his wife reads from her journal. And Marianne, likewise, would never guess that her husband wrote poetry. He can't write. Neither can Charlie, according to Nicole. \"Marriage Story\", of course, is Noah Baumbach's homage to the late Ingmar Bergman. Most pointedly, when Charlie accidentally cuts himself with a retractable blade to the horror of a court-appointed observer, there to document how Charlie \"performs\" as a father. In the Bergman film, all the interior settings look stage-inspired, like you're watching a play. When people go into different rooms, there are cuts, as if in the interim a curtain is drawn and lifted to end, then introduce the next scene. Charlie isn't supposed to cut himself. It's normally a trick to entertain his son. This time, however, the blade doesn't retract all the way. When the observer leaves, Charlie tends to his cut, but not before he faints. His son's lack of concern about the anomaly of his father lying down flat on the kitchen surface suggests less than a dream, but a scene from a play. It's meta.Charlie Barber doesn't want to commit suicide, but \"Charlie Barber\" does.",

It's difficult for Nicole's character to be as sympathetic because we witness the ways she is able to hurt Charlie, and only hear about how Charlie has hurt her in the past. In one culminating outburst, he declares that only being unfaithful to her once was a favor because of how popular he was and how many times he wanted to be unfaithful to her. Still, this outburst comes after his child has been taken away from him, his money is being systematically drained, and his entire career is collapsing- and even then he immediately apologizes for saying it.They both seem to really like each other, and both claim the other is a good parent, but still they find themselves in a courtroom with lawyers making them each sound like neglectful monsters.There is a final scene in which Charlie and his son are reading together and Nicole is standing outside the door, and it really crystallizes how great a family they could've been if they could've just been a little less selfish about the little stuff like who gets credit for what and what city they should live in. That scene made me tear up. The moral of the story is, don't let the little stuff ruin the big stuff- which is clearly what these 2 have done.",

She has just gotten a TV pilot, so she's off to California with their son. They've agreed to an amicable divorce, but she gets a lawyer in California, so he gets a lawyer in California, and things go straight to heck.Hitchcock said \"The length of a film should be directly related to the endurance of the human bladder.\" Netflix has set that at naught. Once upon a time, you saw a movie in a theater, and you didn't want to duck out on a feature, so you headed for the facilities while the James Fitzpatrick Traveltalk was on. Later, you might see it on television, where the presence of \"station identifications\" served as features rather than bugs. Now we have the ability to not only watch from the comfort of our homes, but to stop and start the movie at our pleasure. You can watch this movie's 136 minutes -- that's the length of a season of a British series -- in little more than two hours, or stretch it to over whatever time you wish. Go, take a bath, read WAR AND PEACE, take a trip around the world, these poor characters will be waiting to suffer for your pleasure whenever you like.Is that even a movie as we understand the word? With the constraint of time removed, there's no need to limit the length of the...show. Nor was there much evidence that the film makers had. The leads are brilliant performers; they indulge in long, one-shot monologues, they inhabit their characters, it's a brilliant supporting cast, the leads each sing a song from Sondheim's COMPANY, and by the end of it, it seemed to have gone on as long as my 18-month divorce had. As soon as I left the theater, I began to trim the movie in my own mind, and soon had taken half an hour from it without losing anything from the story. True, you wouldn't hear Miss Johanssen, Julie Hagerty and Merritt Wever sing \"You Could Drive A Person Crazy\" in my version, showing the enormous range and ability necessary to winning awards. But you could go on a date, eat a meal, see the movie, and get home in time to get to work the next morning.Oh, concessions could have been made. An intermission could have been put in. It wasn't, because it was never made with that in mind. So, no, I don't think it's a movie, even if I did see it in a movie theater.Was it good?

Nicole turns out to be a b***h. She played with her husband's feelings. First, she didn't have sex with him for year, then when charlie sleeps with his co worker, she turns hyperactive, and hacks his computer. The lawyer she hires is also a b***h. Both of them plan a conspiracy to get the custody of the child. The social and emotional manipulation of the child is too annoying.\n3) Charlie (Adam driver) is the one who has to suffer throughout. He did committed some mistakes, but his wife didn't even care to either have a discussion or come to an agreement. She simply plays with him. She forced him to move to LA. And the end, what he got, he lost his job in NYC, his company, his money, and most importantly, his child, coz he got only 45 per cent of custody, even through all his sacrifice. Ok, although this is just a story, but it hurts when people are dishonest and call the ending, beautiful and masterpiece. If, that's what american life is, then sorry it's quite weird and disturbing.\n4) The law system is completely biased in the US. It's like favouring the women and bashing the men.

In another words, it can be said craving for love or longing for the past.\nFirst of all, there are some incredible performances, just terrific. The best performance of Scarlett Johansson i've ever seen. She plays the character of Nicole so perfectly. And Adam Driver is so amazing aswell. I think that he will perform just like this one in different films in the future. The actors who plays the secondary characters make the best of their roles. Laura Dern, who i always think that she's an amazing actress, is just perfect. Ray Liotta who plays Jay Marotta who is an ambitious and successful lawyer performs very well in spite of the short screen time.\nI've read and heard various comments about the movie. Although the story is seemed by the perspective of Charlie i think that's an objective point of view from the director. As a matter of fact, i've read that Noah Baumbach writes the story about his own experiences. In fact, he sent the script to his ex-wife Jennifer Jason-Leigh and she loves it. In this regard, it can be said that there's some auto-biographical feature in this film. Because of that, maybe the writer is on \"Charlie's side\" a little bit but as i said, i think that the movie is impartial. So, i think that the audiences understand completely why Nicole wants a divorce and why Nicole can't have self-fulfillment in that marriage.\nThere are a lot of scenes that are memorable. For example, the beginning sequence, the scene that Nicole opens up Nora, the scene that the monologue of Laura Dern about \"the mother is always perfect\", the scene which is Adam Driver sings \"Being Alive\" that's the excellent piece of Stephen Sondheim, the scenes with the halloween and Charlie's loneliness, the scene that Charlie talks on the phone with Nora and exits the theater and finds himself in crowded street of NYC, the scene that Nicole and Charlie face off and Charlie shows the burst of emotion, the scene that Charlie reads Nicole's letter with his son Henry and many more...\nFrankly, the movie is very well directed and written and the actors are so amazing but i've seen some excessive comments how perfect the film is.

It's also really well-shot and well-edited. This is one of those rare movies where there really isn't anything bad about it at all. Well, maybe the score is a little weird and distracting sometimes. It's composed by Randy Newman and sounds right out of a Pixar movie. Wallace Shawn of The Incredibles and Toy Story fame is even in it.

            "content": "Marriage Story is based on the divorce of Writer-Director Noah Baumbach and actress Jennifer Jason Leigh (who I just watched a couple of days ago in Annihilation, another Netflix movie.) It also borrows from Baumbach's parent's divorce, and also from Scarlett Johansson who was going through her second divorce when she was approached for the film. Laura Dern is also a divorcee (shared the same lawyer with Scarlett which Dern's character is loosely based on,) and Adam Driver's parents were also divorced, so when Baumbach said this movie is theirs as much as his, he acknowledges the integral inputs they all gave in making this movie. For a drama, it's not dragging and had its funny moments but it also showed the very ugly side of divorce. One character said: \"Criminal lawyers see bad people at their best, divorce lawyers see good people at their worst.\" It's a business in making look people bad, hitting each other on technicalities and if necessary, go down to the level of magnifying small mistakes as life-threatening ones, all in the name of getting custody of a child they both say they love very much.\nThe movie is very much about Adam Driver and Scarlett Johansson, both of whom bear an uncanny resemblance to Baumbach and Leigh. Adam who I first saw in HBO's Girls, I thought I hated him but also fell in love with which is a testament to his acting ability. In 2019 we saw him both as Kylo Ren in Star Wars Episode IX and Marriage Story, and there's really no way but up for him in the years to come. Scarlett Johansson is good as usual, but her comment about being able to play whatever role she wants still rubs me off in the wrong way. Laura Dern was superb, shining brightly even as a supporting role. Her performance here is a mix of her The Fault in our Stars cool mom and her 'Big Little Lies' vicious mom. It even has a dash of the cunning Vice Admiral Holdo from Star Wars Episode IX.The heart of the movie is the confrontation between the couple. It became more impressive after reading how it was done in 50 takes in two days. They had to finish each take before starting over, and no improvisations were allowed. Everything was scripted, even their pauses. From time to time the director will hand them notes to elicit a different reaction. Other highlights include the scene where Driver's character reads the letter Johansson's character wrote describing him and the litany of Dern's character as to why women are held to higher standards: women are compared to Mary who did everything for Jesus while men are held to standards of Joseph who was an absentee father. Compelling stuff right there.",

            "content": "Regrets held deep down the lane of emotions and ego can often lead to a larger impact than what is usually imaginable & Noah Baumbach's \"Marriage Story,\" a film with highs and as many lows, reflects the very realistic modern-day story of instinctive and very natural love alongside a forceful but understandable differences of opinions.But as they say, no life is perfect. The very word of \"imperfection\" is an integral part of any human being. And Charlie (Adam Driver) and Nicole (Scarlett Johansson) were no different. After years of marriage and a kid of 7-8 years age, Nicole finally decides to move on, citing the selfishness of a normal busy businessman Charlie. And that's where, with a simplistic plot coupled with great depth, the film starts to question your mindset and righteousness. It keeps deceiving the audiences throughout and boggles the minds with numerous scenes that may lead to an emotional attachment....... With two fictitious but highly relatable on screen characters. And then there were the bunch of lawyers, who Charlie even went onto call \"assholes,\" is a perfect example of all the troubles that couples face during the divorcing saga. But is the mental burden the end? No. How the entire society is impacted alongside your kid and how a relationship instinctively ends up lasting forever are well and truly showcased in the most appropriate manner possible in this film.Credits to the the fantastic screenplay and even more fantastic direction of Noah Baumbach! But can we take away anything from the technical department? A huge no. The scoring by Randy Newman, cinematography by Robbie Ryan & editing by Jennifer Lame were top-tier. The usage of 35mm made the film looked more relatable than ever with all the actors looking much larger and closer, and therefore leaving a more mental impact. The off-white coloring helped capturing the essence of Los Angeles and New York alike magnificently. In the end, it was the spot-on dramatic background scoring which played a key-role throughout the film. Most importantly, the dialogue writing, supported by a wonderful yet compact cast selection, was on point. The way Noah Baumbach used metaphors via storybooks, body language and all held the artistical values within but the pace intact. Kudos to each one of the makers in the film for being able to deliver such a masterpiece!All in all, Netflix's \"Marriage Story\" is definitely one of the finest divorce dramas ever and missing it is something I definitely won't be suggesting. Although, it may not be for everyone, partly due to slight bit of profanity and how the theme is adult-centric. But if you decide to watch - be sure to be prepared for an extraordinary emotional rollercoaster ride of lots of differences and other factors (relatable for many)!",

            "content": "If you enjoy reading my Spoiler-Free reviews, please follow my blog :)I don't even know how to start this review... Marriage Story is one of those movies that stays with me long after I've finished it. I've been thinking about it a lot, and it's undoubtedly one of the most realistic dramas I've ever seen. That's due to the award-worthy performances of Adam Driver (Charlie Barber) and Scarlett Johansson (Nicole Barber), but also because of Noah Baumbach's incredibly layered screenplay. In addition to this, Baumbach is undeniably one of the best directors of the year. With the help of his DP, Robbie Ryan, he sets the platform for Driver and Johansson to shine as the astonishing actors that they are.Some people watch films to forget their daily issues. Some just want to have fun. Some want to learn more about a particular true story. However, there's not a single person alive who wants to watch a movie and not be able to leave the theater (or, in this case, their couch) entertained. Marriage Story has such an emotionally complicated premise that it's tough to convince people to sit and watch. I mean, who wants to watch a divorce develop throughout more than two hours? Who wants to watch two people who were once in love with each other become the worst of themselves? Yelling, fighting, court, custody, lawyers... It's not exactly an attention-grabber.I imagine people who went through the same situation getting triggered and remember a phase of their lives that was probably one of their worst. I'm writing this because I've seen some negativity towards people who simply don't want to watch Baumbach's depiction of a depressing event. It's perfectly understandable if anyone decides to skip this one, especially if it hits too close to home. In my case, I've never gone through a divorce (hopefully, I'll never will), and usually I can \"enjoy\" this type of sad, frustrating, bittersweet films (Manchester by the Sea, A Ghost Story) for what they are, no matter how tragic.If I had to choose one-word praise: realistic. There's no way around it. The palpable emotions are the main reason why this story works so well. Only people who have never been in a relationship of any kind can't understand the moment when a fight starts to escalate, and the couple begins to say terrible stuff at each other that they don't exactly mean. The exaggeration and over-the-top arguments are part of every couple's life. They can occur due to a hundred reasons related to stress, work, accumulation of little things, or simply because it's just not a good day.Marriage Story doesn't deliver a hopeful message or a sweet story because that's not what divorces are. It's not difficult to imagine how hard it is to separate yourself from the person you love(d) for years without end, even more when there's a kid involved in the process. Baumbach could have followed the genre cliches and provide moments of pure happiness, but that's not something that happens during a situation like this. It's a heart-wrenching phase to live through, and I believe that this movie is going to be thoroughly analyzed in film school in the next decade or so.THE scene with Driver and Johansson going at each other exponentially harder and heavier criticism-wise is one of the most emotionally powerful dialogues of the millennium. The raw emotion and the physical movements that both actors can bring into the fight are absurdly impressive. Their chemistry is so inexplicably real. I never, not even for a single second, thought that I was watching fictional characters. Nicole and Charlie can very well be our neighbors or part of our family. Baumbach's use of long takes really elevate every single sequence, allowing the protagonists to move around the set and actually act.Technically, there's no better acting this year than what Driver and Johansson deliver. Both are always moving and doing a lot of things while giving their lines. Making dinner, drinking tea, going to the bathroom, chopping a carrot, blowing their nose, standing up, sitting down, walking around the room, crying, smiling, laughing... All of this in a single take! Several times!! Scarlett shows more emotion throughout the runtime than her counterpart, but Adam proves why he's the frontrunner at the 2019's Oscars. His restraint when Charlie is trying to be polite even though he's mad, or his explosive behavior when his character decides to finally let go (excellent build-up), are some of the attributes that make his performance my favorite of the year.Not trying to diminish Johansson's display. Both deliver career-best performances, in my opinion. Both deserve every award that exists. The supporting cast is also impeccable, and I know that Laura Dern (Nora Fanshaw) is probably going to be nominated. Still, the two leads are so engaging and captivating that I couldn't be impressed with anyone else. The only person to rise to the main actors' level is Noah Baumbach himself. With the best screenplay of 2019, he offers the audience an incredibly complex story, filled with subtle details and exceptional dialogue.He controls the movie's pacing beautifully, and he knows the right moments to insert a little joke to lighten up the dark, depressing mood. My only issue with the film has to do with its replay value. We all have been through this situation: watching a fantastic movie, only once, and never again. Marriage Story is going to be one of those films for me. I love everything about it, but I know the chances of a rewatch are very, very small. It's a profoundly unsettling story, super uncomfortable at times, and I really don't want to go through the sadness and frustration all over again.All in all, Noah Baumbach delivers what I believe to be its career-best flick, Marriage Story. With the best screenplay of 2019, as well as one the best directions, this is the closest the world is ever going to get to a realistic depiction of a divorce. Scarlett Johansson and Adam Driver also give the best performances of their lives, elevating every single scene, dialogue, argument, or joke. The long takes allow them to shine and actually work as actors, moving around the set and doing domestic/job tasks, while delivering their lines. Technically, both Baumbach and the entire cast are absolutely perfect. It's an extremely emotional narrative, very depressing, sad, and even uncomfortable at times, which might scare some people off, especially if they've been through this. Despite its replay value being affected (a rewatch is very unlikely), it's a phenomenal lesson in storytelling that stays with us long after it's finished. Easily, one of the best movies of 2019. Don't miss it, and try not to cry.",

            "content": "This is one of the most emotionally beautiful films I have ever seen. It's like if peeling an onion caused you to laugh instead of cry, but still activated your tear ducts.\nThis film is a love story about divorce. Charlie (Adam Driver), who is a well-known theatre Director about to take his play to Broadway, and Nicole, (Scarlett Johansson) who has become a well-known actress due to starring in Charlie's plays, meet in this industry and marry living a life together with their son Henry. Ten years into their marriage, Charlie and Nicole decide to divorce amicably without lawyers until Nicole hires a lawyer unannounced and things start to become worse than initially intended.DIRECTION:\nNoah Baumbach (not to be confused with Johan Sebastian Bach) did a spectacular job taking a sad subject and showing such purity and grace. The movie is so grounded causing it to feel like two real people who truly love each other going through this tough time. Baumbach also creates a theatrical feel to the film. He does this by having long drawn-out scenes coupled with beautiful dialogue usually only between only 2-3 characters at once.WRITING:\nI have to double down with what I said under \"DIRECTION.\" The writing is so pure and real, that it feels like you are truly watching the emotional nature of divorce. You truly feel like you're watching a documentary on two people struggling to balance their secretive resentment and love for each other. I always say that my favorite films are those that can keep me engaged strictly through dialogue and this is a perfect example.ACTING:\nAdam Driver me to the Oscars to watch you receive this reward. Oh my goodness and gracious. There's a specific performance in a scene between Mr. Driver and Ms. Johansson that I think could easily by itself deliver an Oscar for both of them. This is also coming off a great performance in \"The Report\" (Adam Driver) and an amazing supporting role in Jojo Rabbit (Scarlett Johansson). Not to mention the superb supporting cast with the likes of Laura Dern, Ray Liotta and Alan Alda. This incredible ensemble really takes the film to another realm of realism and beauty.CONCLUSION:\nMarriage Story does what it is set out to do and that is make you feel. Through the Direction, Writing and Acting, this film doesn't make you pick sides or dread so much the process of what can be a very dreadful process. Although the story at it's core is sad, this is also one of the funniest movies of the year and it makes me feel like I'm going through a painful divorce with the same feelings that both Charlie and Nicole feel. I still need to see Uncut Gems, Richard Jewell, Little Women, etc., but as of right now this takes the #1 spot in my top 10 in 2019.",

            "review_title": "Divorce Story LA style - A ghastly spectacle!",
            "content": "Movies about people who make movies are always suspect for their tendency to lapse into self-indulgence (much as novels about writers are), the more so when the writer is also the director (Noah Baumbach here). When this is accompanied by a running time of over two-and-a-quarter hours, the alarm bells are ringing before you even enter the cinema.Such expectations are rapidly and amply confirmed by this mis-titled movie, which drags on far too long for its own and the viewers' good. Billed as a 'marriage story', the focus is on divorce.But the subtext is 'woman triumphant in a world of pathetic men'. In short, this is yet another AMM (Anti-Man Movie).In a movie based on contrasting pairs, NYC vies with LA, East Coast with West, theatre directing with movie making, lawyer-free divorce proceedings with lawyer-dominated, in control Nicole (Scarlett Johansson) with her hapless husband, Charlie (Adam Driver). While the leading female characters are portrayed as strong, powerful, determined, funny, talented, competent and winners, the men are generally either rapacious brutes (the LA lawyer, Jay) or self-centred infants. Charlie epitomises the latter: he's really not very good at anything much apart from theatre directing. He's not much good at marriage and doesn't handle divorce well either; he's not much good with practical tasks, such as fitting a child's car seat, he's clumsy, accidentally slashing his arm with a pocket knife, and is even told by the lover with whom he had a one night stand that ended his marriage that he's not good at accepting generosity when she offers more of the same and he refuses.Charlie is not a bad guy but he's a child who needs mothering rather than an adult, a status rather crudely emphasised by the weird 1970s hairstyle he shares with his six-year old son. Moreover, Nicole cuts his hair for him too. I was half-expecting to see her spongeing him down in the bathtub and drying between his toes! Thus at the end of a furious row that, like everything else, goes on much longer than needed for dramatic effect, it is Charlie who breaks down, only to be comforted with a pat on the head by resolute Nicole. And then, in the movie's closing scene, as Charlie is about to take his son for some dad-and-lad time, Nicole notices his shoelace is untied and ties it for him. Gee, the guy can't even lace his own shoes! No wonder he couldn't cope with Nicole.Since the story itself has very little originality, everything hangs on the performances and the direction. Unfortunately, the scaffolding that holds everything together is all too evident. Often one can sense the presence of the director and the cameras lurking in front of the cast and read the directions - 'we need a set piece monologue from Scarlett here with a long close-up'. As a result, there is no chemistry between the leads because everything seems too obviously contrived. Subtlety is certainly not the movie's strong point. The only really convincing performance comes from Alan Alda who plays the kindly NY lawyer, Bert Spitz, a minor character.And then there is the uneasy attempt at mixing genres. In part this is a serious domestic drama with the fate of the warring couple's child at stake. But Baumbach also goes for humour, with some OTT performances from the LA lawyers, especially Laura Dern, and even puts in a song-and-dance number by the triumphant Nicole, her neurotic mother and ditzy sister, and a mournful solo song from Charlie. The effect of this mixture is jarring.Frankly, we couldn't wait to be divorced from this self-indulgent film.\n(Viewed at HOME Arts Centre, Manchester, UK, 21 November 2019)",

            "review_title": "A penetrating look at the spiraling effect of divorce American style",
            "content": "Noah Baumbach's (\"The Meyerowitz Stories\") Marriage Story is a penetrating look at the spiraling effect of divorce American style on those involved, one that radiates compassion for its beleaguered characters Nicole (Scarlett Johansson, \"Avengers: Endgame\") and Charlie (Adam Driver, \"BlacKkKlansman\") as they struggle to maintain their dignity through a dehumanizing process. If love means never having to say you're sorry, you are probably not living on planet Earth, though I'm sure other places may have their compensations. For Nicole and Charlie, however, just saying \"I'm sorry\" will not even reach the tip of the iceberg.Nicole is a native of Los Angeles who left a budding movie career on the West Coast to move to New York with their young son Henry (Azhy Robertson, \"After the Wedding\") to star in the productions of her husband Charlie, an acclaimed theater director. In his role as Charlie, Driver is consistently brilliant in his portrayal of a man on the brink of despair, desperately trying to hold his life together in the face of fast changing circumstances, while Johansson has that uncommon quality that makes you care deeply about her. We first meet the two through film montages in which they discuss each other's virtues and idiosyncrasies, love letters asserting the qualities that they find endearing.Nicole loves that Charlie is organized and dresses without embarrassing her. Charlie loves the way Nicole cuts his hair and makes tea and leaves it around the house. Charlie talks about his wife's devotion to playing with their son and how patient she is. To Nicole (who refuses to read hers out loud), Charlie never gets upset about the little things and is really a talented director. Unfortunately, we soon find out that the tributes were only written at the request of a marriage mediator as part of the couple's plans for divorce. Nicole refuses the request to read it aloud, however, and leaves the room in a fit of temper. This becomes more understandable when we learn that she has decided to take Henry with her to L.A. to shoot a TV pilot and pursue her movie ambitions.Complicating the situation is the fact that Charlie has just received a MacArthur Fellowship and has agreed to live in New York. Further muddying the water is Charlie's affair with a woman at his theater company. Although Charlie believes Nicole plans to move back to New York after the shoot, she has other ideas and the thought of having to travel back and forth on a 3,000 mile trip to see his son does not sit well with Charlie. It seems to be resolved, however, when during his visit to California, he ends up being served divorce papers by Nicole's sister Cassie (Merritt Wever, \"Greenberg\") in one of the funniest scenes in a film in which humor is sparse but always welcome.What starts out as an amicable separation between two people who treat each other with respect turns into a circus, however, when high-priced, aggressive, and uncaring lawyers, Laura Dern (\"Star Wars: The Last Jedi\"), Ray Liotta (\"The Son of No One\") and Alan Alda (\"Bridge of Spies\") come into the picture and the weather forecast becomes cloudy with a likelihood of rain. Fighting a custody battle for Henry, Dern is exceptional as Nicole's lawyer Nora Fanshaw, an outwardly warm and caring person, but underneath a saber-toothed cat who delivers a crusading speech about the different expectations for a woman. Charlie's second lawyer after the amiable, but too laid back, Bert Spitz (Alda) is Jay (Liotta in his best role since 2012's \"The Place Beyond the Pines\").Jay is up front about the financial cost ($950 an hour) as well as the emotional cost in turning resolvable differences into attack weapons to corner and belittle his adversary. With some personal experience in the matter, Baumbach does his best not to show preference for either aggrieved party, but depicts the divorce process to be one that is filled with gladiator-like combat that only serves to draw the contesting parties further apart. While it is obvious that the charming, self-absorbed Charlie should have shown more awareness of Nicole's needs for a career of her own, it is equally the case that his wife's ability to communicate her needs was inadequate.If \"love is a function of communication,\" Nicole and Charlie forgot it somewhere along the way. The film's emotional high point is the animated, accusatory conversation between husband and wife, perhaps better described as a shouting match. Though well-written, the verbal sparring becomes overwrought, though it mercifully ignores excessive use of the \"F\" and \"S\" words, so lazily prevalent in today's culture as a substitute for thoughtful dialogue and wit. While Marriage Story covers a lot of ground and is open to many interpretations, it all but stays away from any deep examination of the larger issues in a relationship such as commitment, responsibility, and communication, the cornerstones of any successful marriage.Asked what the film is about, Baumbach says, \"It's many things; it's about how love is not always enough.\" As author Werner Erhard put it, however, \"The truth is that that's all there is. And if you take the barriers out of the way, if you take the pretenses out of the way, if you take those things that you didn't take responsibility for in your life out of the way, what you have left is love,\" and adds, \"You don't have to be looking for love when it is where you come from.\"",

I also found the score ill-suited and jarring.On the other hand though, I think the slow disintegration of the relationship after the commencement of the divorce was well portrayed, as was the simple intimacies demonstrated throughout the film.Excellent supporting cast, particularly Laura Dern who steals almost all scenes she is in.

            "review_title": "More Neil Simon than Bergman, or even Woody Allen",
            "content": "Seen 10/07/19 at the NYFF.As with other Baumbach films, \"Marriage Story\" is long on talk and short on cinema, which makes it a strange choice for a featured spot in this year's NY Film Festival, especially since it is the second film on the main slate about a director, in this case a theatre director instead of a filmmaker, but still... I, for one, have limited tolerance for films or plays about directors on novels about novelists, etc. These have a higher burden than others to meet in convincing me that I should care about them. In the case of this year's film director's film about, very transparently, himself, Pedro Almod\u00f3var's \"Pain and Passion\" passes the test with ease, as it is glorious cinema. \"Marriage Story\", though, is more Neil Simon that Bergman (despite the aspirational allusion in the title and in a brief visual shout-out to \"Scenes From a Marriage\"), or even Woody Allen, who is just as wordy but makes better cinema, at least in his older and better films. With its sorta jokey NY/LA rivalry theme, and in certain LA frames, \"Annie Hall\" also appears to be evoked here, but the mere mention of these films highlights the weakness of this one.There is some, passing enjoyment to be had. Scarlett Johansson is, as always, radiant and holds the screen in ways that few of today's female leads can do - she needs to find directors who can make more of that. Laura Dern turns in a stellar performance as a vicious divorce lawyer camouflaged in California unctuousness, and there are some fine cameos from Roy Liotta, Alan Alda, the great Wallace Shawn, and others. (On the other hand, Johansson's husband/foil, Adam Driver, is as bland and uninteresting to watch while he forces himself to emote as anyone I've seen lately this side of a TV sitcom.) But Baumbach remains firmly within his milieu of affluent, if not wealthy, Brooklyn and LA showbiz people and their neuroses. It's all very narcissistic and more than a little contrived -- as I say, this is more theatre, with its elborate, paced plotting intended as build-up to the leads' Big Scene, which here tears up the scenery - literally - to no great effect.Baubach in fact makes what I'm sure is an unforced error in a courtroom scene where, for the first time, ordinary (and diverse) Angelinos are seen waiting their turn before a judge, who makes a welcome comment to the effect that he is adjourning the case around which the film revolves as there are plenty of people with far fewer resources awaiting their turn. Indeed. And so the inevitable question arises: why, in 2019, should we care about these particular white, privileged, affluent, undoubtedly smart, but politically and socially obtuse people as they go through the predictable phases in the break-up of a marriage whose reality was never very convincing to begin with? Why should we spend our time watching what amounts to a modernized version of an old-fashioned drawing-room comedy, updated to take account certain contemporary sensibilities, particularly of the feminist sort?Like many of the other films shown this year NYFF (and of many more that are not), the main producers here are Netflix, which is rapidly carving out a place for itself in American cinema comparable to that played by the Canal+ cable network in France. Though its support to quality cinema is welcome (Scorsese's \"The Irishman\", but also documentaries like the terrific \"An American Factory\"...), there must be concern about how long it will allow its productions to run in proper cinemas before they disappear into the streaming ether. In most cases, that would be a huge loss for potential viewers, as films like these demand to be seen on a big screen. In the case of \"Marriage Story\", though, there will be little loss: it contains so little that is gripping from a cinematic point-of-view that it will do just fine on a flat screen on an iPhone.\nIf you do watch this film, try to imagine what would be left if you turned off the dialogue. It would almost certainly become clear that you're dealing with filmed theatre, not cinema. A single image from the following night's NYFF feature, Joon-Ho Boong's breathtaking \"Parasite\" is worth 10,000 of this dreary film's many, many words.",

When I booked for this at the 2019 London Film Festival, it sounded like it would be Baumbach's \"Annie Hall\", and it certainly starts well, with a sparky script and a great cast, but it soon grinds to a plod due to the complete lack of chemistry between the leads and therefore absolutely no feeling, no matter how much they talk about it, that they have any kind of shared history (even their son, used - natch - as a bargaining chip throughout the messy divorce, has about as much appeal as a potato). During one particularly lengthy argument, Scarlett Johannson glows with incandescent rawness, but can't strike a spark from her co-star, the dead-eyed and apparently sedated Adam Driver. I'll admit, his appeal escapes me, but he sure can sing -- he inexplicably gets to sing an entire number from \"Company\" at a piano bar, and pulls it off admirably well. But this film is overlong, over shouty and brings absolutely nothing new to the table. I think I'll watch \"Annie Hall\" again, thanks.",

            "review_title": "Most Well Written Film in a Long Time. I cried...",
            "content": "One of the best and most emotional films of the year. I cried. I haven't seen any of Noah Baumbach's previous films but I really want to now after seeing this film. To start off I want to talk about the two main actors, Scarlett Johansson and Adam Driver, they are incredible. Their performances are perfect, not only the best I've seen this year, but some of the best I've ever seen. Scarlett's character was one who is asked to showcase a lot of emotion, and I was shocked to see that she was attempting to hold back that emotion for a good portion of the film which made her performance all the more real and powerful. And not held back in the sense that the emotion is not present, but rather in a sense that it's realistic, because when she's speaking around other people it makes sense why the character wouldn't want to cry in front of them. I thought it was so brilliant that she found the perfect point where it looked like she was tearing up but not quite crying. And Adam Driver just brought so much passion and expression to this role. He really immersed himself deep into this character to the point where I forgot I was watching Adam Driver acting and I instead just saw the character. And I think the best kind of acting is the kind where you stop seeing the actor and you just see the character. Quite frankly both of them deserve to win Oscars for these roles. I love Joaquin Phoenix and he's long overdue for an Oscar, but I think Adam Driver deserves it more. The writing for this film was superb, the script and dialogue were perfect. Quite honestly I think this is the best screenplay of the year, I hope the Academy honors it with an Oscar as well. Noah Baumbach did a good job directing as well, there were plenty of long takes that really captured the power of the scene. This film is very character driven and dialogue heavy, it's a very quiet film, nothing miraculous is happening on screen. When it comes to heavily dramatic films such as this one, there's a lot of directors who would attempt to make a lot of scenes over the top, overdramatized, and larger than what they really are or should be. But Noah Baumbach portrays this story about a divorce and all the dramatic scenes in a very realistic manner that never felt over dramatic or went too far, and I thought that was absolutely brilliant. As far as the characters go, they are flawless. They are the most fleshed out and deeply explored characters I've seen this year. They are incredibly interesting and complex. Quite honestly this film showcases a story that's been told before, but it makes all those films that came before it look shallow and underdeveloped. The film doesn't explain the characters to you, it just presents them, and it doesn't take sides with either one, because they are so complex that quite honestly there isn't a good guy or bad guy in this scenario. They're simply just two people who aren't good for each other and are just not working. Whichever one you found yourself siding with, in the end the film makes you realize that it doesn't matter. The score from Randy Newman was also fantastic, it complimented the visuals and conveyed the tone of the film very well. The best aspects of this film were the acting and the writing, so you should see it on those merits alone, and it's on Netflix right now so you can watch it in the comfort of your own home. I thought this was one the best and most powerful films of the year and just so well written.",

Just like how all of the actors made us feel like they were real people the way it's directed and written makes us feel like a fly on the wall during this. I personally have never witnessed people getting a divorce but this movie gave me insight into what goes down and this film isn't afraid to show the realism of what happens. I personally feel like there was only one thing they could have done to make this more accurate to what happens during a divorce but overall it seemed accurate to what goes down. Really my only problem with the movie is that I feel like there were some scenes missing that I wish were included. Sure, the movie is already two-hours and sixteen-minutes long but I feel like there were some scenes that we needed to see.

In about August, this became my most anticipated film of the year. I just love Scarlett Johansson and Adam Driver proved to be great with his Oscar nomination for BlacKkKlansman. Also I discovered Noah Baumbach last year with his film While We're Young which I think is very underrated. He's had a few Oscar nominations and is just a great screenwriter and director. Before Marriage Story my favorite of his was the slice of life Frances Ha. This film affected me on so many levels emotionally. I don't know how one could possibly watch this without shedding at least one tear. It's so incredibly real and it's just amazing how it all played out. Scarlett Johansson has her best performance once again. I feel like every time she's in a film she just gets better and better. The hardest part about this film is that it shows both sides and you can switch back and forth between who you like more and who you like less. But also you don't want them to split up. Noah Baumbach did great with this because it's a frustrating film. It engages you into the characters and story so much that you start to feel so much anger and frustration and happiness and comedy. The tone has literally everything and blends it great. Back to the comedy, this film has some pretty funny moments that helped with the depressing tone. Marriage Story just made me depressed, especially the very end, and it still lingered after I watched it. The very end just crushed me but it was also the best scene in the whole film. Just everything blends so nicely in this. Randy Newman's score is one of my favorites of the year. It's so joyful and sad at the same time. Listening to it before seeing the film I was confused how it would work with the story, because there are times where it sounded just so animated. It just worked perfectly. I also liked the aspect ratio choice of 1.66:1 because it felt more like a home movie. To me 1.33:1 and 1.66:1 work nice for a home movie feel. Everything was just so realistic in this and I didn't want it to end. This has become my fourth favorite film of the year so far. Also it's one of those films where I don't want to rewatch it too much so it surprises me every time with how great it is. I do that with my favorite films. Marriage Story is a film that should be recognized as one of the best of the decade. It demonstrates peak storytelling, superb acting, and shows that Noah Baumbach is one of the best directors out there. I really think it would be cool if it won best picture, screenplay, and acting. There are so many words I have for this and I want to talk about it for a while. I think I'll leave it like this so you can experience it for yourself. Marriage Story is another perfect movie of the year.My Grade: A+",

            "content": "This movie will play differently to different people. For me, it hit close to home. Growing up in a broken family, I had to start dealing with parent issues when I was 6. I remember things vividly. My mom running away with me in the night. The fights. The split. The divorce and endless battle over things. Going to my dad's on the weekend and a variety of other things. This movie displays that like nothing else ever has.Despite both parties wanting a clean divorce, it also shows how nasty that can become. It's frustrating to experience and just as frustrating to watch on screen.Adam and Scarlett have standout performances in this film. We all know what Scarlett can do. We also know what Adam is capable of but I believe this is one of his best roles on display here.It was interesting to me since this movie didn't have violence. My parent's divorce and I've seen many friends that had nasty divorces with violence included. While depressing, it was still somewhat refreshing to see this situation play out with no violence.The only aspect of this film that falls short to me is how the couple is tied up with acting. That's fine and I'm sure things like this happen with relationships in Hollywood but it made the film a little pretentious. It became a battle of one person's career in theatre/Broadway in NY vs another person's TV career in LA. It made it tough to relate and while the plot tried to remain focused on the kid as being the reason, I couldn't get past it.There could be best actor/actress chances behind this film going in to rewards season but It's not taking any technical or best picture awards. I could also see some screenplay nods here.This film is certainly worth the watch. It'll likely be one of the films remembered when you see it come up but I doubt it'll be revisited as years go by.",

But I will dive in a little more.\nI base movies on 3 items. #1 did it inspire me, like I mentioned I am a new dad and this was very inspiring in what not to do and pitfalls to try to avoid and made me want to step back and be a better husband and father. #2 did it leave me awestruck, coming from a loving home and family this was hard to see. It moved me emotionally. #3 was it entertaining, the acting was on point. Adam and Scarlett did an amazing job. The storyline flowed. I laughed I cried it was well worth my time.

            "content": "The subject of divorce is not something new for film, it's been done countless times by many rom com type movies that often end up coming of as disingenuous and fake. Well that's not the case with Noah Baumbach latest Marriage story, A compassionate and in depth look at the family unit in the face of break up with some of the most fleshed out and fully realised characters I have seen all year.The Best aspect to this movie would have to be the script. Both are main characters (Played brilliantly by Adam Driver and Scarlett Johansson) have so much character to them and feel like genuinely real people. We see both these characters for who they are, neither of these people are perfect and the movie doesn't shy away from that, rather than have a bias we are shown both sides of the story and even if you do end up siding with one of the characters at no point do you not understand and sympathise with the other. That's what makes Marriage story so special, because it never paints either of the characters as the bad guy, which in turn gives the film a much more genuine feel to it that you don't usually find in these types of movie. On A side note the movie is also extremely funny, The Serving scene specifically was just perfect.The actors do such A phenomenal with the material here. Early in the film Scarlett Johansson has a long monologue that's given in one continuous shot, and I forgot that I was watching a movie. She felt so incredibly real and at no point did I see an actor giving a performance. Same goes for Adam driver, both actors are award worthy here. The Supporting cast is also great including the likes of Laura Dern and Ray Liotta playing the divorce lawyers.With a run time of almost 2 hour and 30 minutes. Its Impressive just how quickly that runtime seems to go. That's mainly due to the fact that no stone is left unturned So to speak. Marriage story goes so in depth into the effect divorce can have on 2 people that any movie that came before (and potentially even after) ends up feeling as shallow as a puddle. This movie truly is something special and I can't think of a single person that won't enjoy this.",

I don't need to name names.Extra points for giving Ray Liotta a job. He did great.This definitely deserves to be considered a classic.

But here the difference is the feminine vision that director Baumbach makes of it, entrusting to Johansson (often without make-up and without too much sex appeal) the torment for a decision made and the affirmation, finally, to think about his life without annihilation due to falling in love.\nThe only discordant note, for a film that is otherwise well packaged, is the singing insert of the protagonist who wants to demonstrate his fragility for the experience he lived in front of his theater company.\nA final, entirely subjective consideration: from an actor's point of view, the presence of Adam Driver exceeds all of a head!",

            "content": "REVIEW of the \"Marriage Story\"\nTo fully grasp the meaning and the quality of \"Marriage Story\" some essential relationship issues need to be explained. Relationship changes over the years. What starts as lustful need to sexually connect with another human being, transforms over the years to more of a partnership relation.\nOur relations with our children permit us to exercise the demons of our childhood and being parent, this time in power position, it helps us heal the wounds our parent did to us.\nUsing Freudian logic and his \"penis envy\" theory it points that woman on a subconscious level envy man, because of their strength and resilience associating masculinity with stability and femininity with being weak and unstable. However from another view point, its the feminine sensibility is what brings nourishment and ability to raise a child in environment that is being protective over the offspring. Children come out of female womb therefor on subconscious level are part of mother's body.\nOnce woman give birth, there is often change in their character. By fulfilling their motherhood duties, as they age woman cut their hair short which gives them more masculine feeling. They might start to resent their male partner for not paying the same amount of attention and start to look for proverbial plan \"B\". Man as they age loose testosterone and eventually want to prove to themselves that they still got it and invest their interest in trivial things like fast cars and even faster younger woman. Both parties start to resent one another for sacrifices they had to make for their families and eventually grow apart searching for that other person that would bring back that feeling of being worshiped once again.\nI was unsure If I will like \"Marriage Story\". Over 2 hour long story of an actress and theatre director intertwined in custody battle over their son might not be for everyones linking, specially if any of you went through an actual divorce this film might be little bit too close to home, so to speak.\nAlso this movie is very dialog heavy and often feels like a theatre play with actors regurgitating long amounts of text, which is used as the main source of exposition. At one point I felt like I am watching Woody Allen movie minus the neuroses and sarcasm. But as you are investing your time in getting to know your protagonists you start to understand them on a deeper level. Its the performances that hold this film together. Both Driver and Johnsson deliver deep heartfelt performances rooted in something real. But even supporting cast works very well as an unusable.In terms of filmmaking this film will not win any major awards. The cinematography is not \"Marriage Story\" strongest point, in fact it lacks imagination making it look like a theatre play, but this film shouldn't be seen for an eye candy that isn't, but for acting performances alone.\nThere is an Oscar buzz around Driver's performance and I was curious if its justified. And indeed it is. There is specially one scene in the apartment where Scarlett comes to try to mediate with Adam to find peaceful solution to their costly divorce, which takes turn in to blaming game of why their life turned out the way it did. They both are mesmerizing here but Driver connects his rage to something real from his personal past which makes audience feel like they are the fly on the wall and are witnessing something very intimate they were not suppose to see. Confrontation between two people who underneath love one another.Scarlett's character wanted to be individual, not part of overbearing somewhat narcissistic personality of her husband. Actors are like children, they want to play, deep down inside looking for an approval from their parent figure - director, who is there to help them conceive their performance.\nBut in her performance Scarlett resents him for loosing interest in her although as they have opportunities to be with other people they are still connected in sense of belonging to one another.\nBottom line \"Marriage Story\" isn't a perfect movie by any means, but thanks to very good cast and smart writing as well as brilliant performances it elevates it beyond my expectation.\nAnd yes Adam Driver will get Oscar nomination and perhaps Scarlett might steal one two.\n***1/2 out of 5",

The movie has a great score; music coming in just when it was needed but not staying it's welcome. The story was great and so accurate to real life situations (not over-exaggerating things at all). The one 'problem' I had (which was barley a problem) was that 1% of accuracy. I think the film could have shown Charlie (Adam Driver) being more emotionally unstable; they did do this many times, yet I think that could have made it more common or more significant when it did happen.\nThe last minor bump i have is that someone who in their life has not experienced what this film shows may not connect to the film as much as someone who has. This could make the experience not as emotional as the viewer may not be as sensitive about the story. I think this is why maybe bringing more of that emotion into the film could help others understand/connect with the film.",

            "content": "'Marriage Story' showcases the rough experience of going through a divorce. At he same time, however, there are moments where love and affection are present but never really touched upon. I find it ironic that the title of the movie includes the word 'marriage', when it's an antithesis of what a marriage should be. In fact, outside of the two lead actor's divorce, it seems like the image of the perfect relationship is never shown. Most of the people we meet come from a poor relationship as well. The film, as could be expected, is driven by the acting. I would say that everyone in the movie did a great job. The acting gives a sense of realism and emotion that just captures your attention. An outside variable that makes the movie that much stronger is how divorces have become quite the norm. Perhaps you know someone that's divorced. Maybe the causes of divorce aren't the same as in the movie, but just the circumstances that come into play really make you feel sorry for the characters. As far as filmaking goes, I would say that long takes are frequently used in the movie and give a great purpose. The thing about long takes is that they are only great if the audience is unaware of them. So the performances are so well, that they should make you forget about the fact that it's one take. Overall, it's a powerful movie that isn't that big. The impact it makes is just amazing.",

I felt no compassion for Scarlett Johansson's character, and spent the whole time wondering why this script was so dull and humorless. I realized then it was because it was written too shallow and didn't explore any nuance whatsover.

            "content": "This has been an incredibly good year for movies, and the fact that I can say that when there's still so many more to see is more impressive still. Add Marriage Story to the list of potential 2019 classics too- it's easily Noah Baumbach's best film yet, and features what could be career best performances from both Scarlett Johansson and the always captivating Adam Driver.The screenplay is all but a shoe-in for an Academy Award, due to the brilliant manner in which it delivers emotional gut-punch after emotional gut-punch without feeling overly sentimental or sappy; it's an absolute tearjerker for sure, but it never feels cheap, and it never feels manipulative. Usually films that feel so grounded in reality leave me cold (looking at you Michel Haneke and Ingmar Bergman), but this one strikes a balance that I've hardly ever seen before. It's the best of both worlds, really.Also admirable is how great the entire supporting cast is (including the child actor), and how everyone feels like a real person. Both leads have admirable qualities and qualities that make them flawed and incredibly human. It's tough at times to see these two flawed yet sympathetic people pitted against each other; it would be an easier sit if one was villainised but this really isn't the case, and the film is all the more strong because of it (though it does lead to some intentionally uncomfortable and very tense scenes that still prove hard to look away from).I was sceptical about Netflix's potential to make the sort of big, awards-worthy movies that typically top best of the year lists, but between this and Scorsese's latest, I have to say they're doing some impressive stuff. You won't lose too much from watching this at home over in a cinema, in fact it might be easier- after all, crying in public isn't always ideal, and chances are you will tear up more than once in this film's final act.But importantly, as mentioned before: those tears are earned, thanks to the incredible characterisation, dialogues, and performances. This one's unmissable, and really, if it's going to be on Netflix within the next few weeks, you have no excuse, really.",

            "content": "First Hit: Well-acted story about a challenging process that many people go through - divorce.This is a story about Charlie (Adam Driver) and Nicole (Scarlett Johansson), who met in Los Angeles and moved to New York City, where Charlie was living. Then they got married, worked together in Charlie's theater company, and had a young child, a boy named Henry (Azhy Robertson).Over time, the story has Nicole becoming lost in Charlie's shadow. Although she is the star of all his stage productions, she feels overshadowed. She's also a long way from her LA family and her family home. Her mother and father were in show business, and before meeting Charlie, Nicole had received some fame for one of her television appearances.As they contemplate the divorce, there seems to be an unspoken agreement that they will do this amicably. It is spoken that they both want the best for Henry and that both want to be involved in raising Henry.During the opening scenes showing each of them in brief scenes while a voiceover has each of them stating what they like, love, or struggle with the other person. As the scene unfolds into a current moment, they are both sitting in front of a marriage counselor mediator. Each of them has been asked to read these statements about the other. Charlie is ready willing and able; Nicole is not and storms out of the office.This made me wonder about some other underlying cause of her wanting to end the marriage. We do learn later that Charlie had a one-time affair with one of the people in his theater company.The film takes a journey across the US from New York City to Los Angeles, where Nicole and Henry visit her mother. She has decided to stay there, despite her acting in the couples' latest play heading to Broadway.Charlie travels out to visit Henry. While in LA, he learns that Nicole has seen an aggressive attorney Nora Fanshaw (Laura Dern), who is pushing to make this divorce contentious. When he's served with divorce papers, he feels blindsided. To protect his interests, Charlie engages a Los Angeles lawyer, Jay Marotta (Ray Liotta), who wants a $25K retainer to come up with a plan to make sure Charlie gets his son Harry in New York.However, the aggressiveness of the whole thing turns Charlie off, so he engages a new, more passive attorney Bert Spitz (Alan Alda). During a discussion with Nicole and Nora, Charlie realizes things are out of control for him.The film then moves to tell what happens to Charlie and Nicole as they go through the divorce court process and the subsequent fallout. A touching scene towards the end shows Henry reading Nicole's list of traits to Charlie, and Nicole is standing near the door listening in. Very touching.Driver is excellent as Charlie. The scene in the bar when he's singing to his theater company employees was wonderfully staged and felt very real. Johansson was terrific as Nicole. I felt as though she captured questioning being swallowed up in Charlie's life well. Robertson, as Henry, was enjoyable as Charlie and Nicole's child. Dern was strong as an attorney who wanted her client to win on all counts. Alda was okay as the passive attorney who tried to weave the least obstructive way through the divorce. Liotta was powerful as Charlie's aggressive attorney. Noah Baumbach wrote and directed this sensitive and sophisticated look at divorce.Overall: This film touched many divorce subjects and implications both sensitively and effectively.",

            "content": "'Marriage Story (2019)' is full of love despite being about a divorce, taking time to establish that its focal couple don't stop caring about one another just because their marriage has drifted to an end. The piece is chock full of emotion, ranging from domestic bliss to raging agony, and it's ultimately rather nuanced, maintaining a sly sense of humour throughout most scenes. There are no winners or losers, just fallible people fumbling through their upturned lives. In this way, the affair is rather refreshing. It tells a simple tale with (comparatively) small stakes but makes it utterly compelling, equally as heart-wrenching as hopeful. The two leads are at the top of their game, proving you don't need a lightsaber or a leather suit to truly connect with an audience. Indeed, you don't need them - or any other weapons - to craft what's nearly the most devastating fight scene of the year. The experience is pretty universal, something often experienced but rarely seen, and it's incredibly effective. It's also rather affecting, hitting home hard on a number of occasions. There's not much else to say: it's a well-made and engaging drama that deserves to be seen. This sort of thing doesn't grace the big screen as often as it should, which is why it's a shame that it has been relegated to a limited release before its Netflix debut. Its only flaw is that the occasionally over-played, mile-a-minute screenplay doesn't always give its events enough time to berate - though, it often does - and that its 'both sides' perspective sort of leads to a film of two halves in which you don't fully connect with either party because you tend to leave their perspective. The screenplay is great and you do care about the characters, don't get me wrong. It's just that those areas are clearly weak-spots - minor weak-spots but weak-spots nevertheless. Overall, the movie is great. If you own Netflix, you've no reason to skip it. 7/10",

            "content": "While the title of \"Marriage Story\" may give off the impression of a romantic comedy, this soulful but often very bleak divorce drama certainly isn't that. However, it's an extremely well-made film that absolutely demands to be seen and fully paid attention to. Written and directed by Noah Baumbach, the film tells the story of a theatre director in New York City who is on the verge of making it to Broadway, and his wife, an actress who moves to Los Angeles after finding employment there. As the two main characters, Adam Driver and Scarlett Johansson both do an outstanding job of portraying a near-perfect blend of strong emotions and down-to-earth, humanistic realism in their performances. Baumbach's script is witty and powerful, complemented by a subtle yet ultimately impactful and enthralling score.Another highlight in the film is Laura Dern's exceptional performance as the divorce attorney for Johansson's character. She manages to come across as both empathetic yet deeply pragmatic and convincing, and her character is thoughtfully developed. I've always really liked Dern as an actress, but her supporting performance here is truly exceptional and will hopefully be rewarded come awards season. The film's emotional power is also commendable, as it simple yet potent nature hits the viewer like a gut punch. We actually truly feel for all of the characters involved, both the main couple as well as the supporting characters. The film is also improved by Baumbach humanizing both of the two main characters. We are able to see both of these two individuals as not only spouses, but flawed yet sometimes well-meaning individuals going through extremely difficult times personally. While it's slightly long and has a few somewhat clich\u00e9 moments, this is otherwise an extremely well-made film from Baumbach that will be remembered long after the credits roll. 8.5/10",

            "content": "\"Marriage Story\" as a character study, shines all the way through. It excels in authenticity and tremendously showcases the feel of affection by minute detailings. Unlike many similar movies that reside in the same space.\nBacked up by some terrific performances from Adam Driver and Scarlett Johansson; the script had given its all! Despite being little bit stretched in my nitpicky opinion, it certainly makes itself stand out from the rest. Besides the obvious inputs from two excellent talents; it has also shown its merits through artistry and nuances. Unlike many romantic or relationship based movies; where affection or feel of love is shown by intimacy and sex; This one flawlessly depicts the same with little unconventional things. Such as Tieing 'His' shoelaces. Protect 'Her' when she's struggling to keep herself up. Celebrating 'His' hard earned achivements and also appreciating 'Her' efforts. These were some examples projected by two of the main leads that signifies how love can also be conveyed through nuances rather than usual approaches. And this film does that magnificently. Seriously great job on that!My only gripe is that I really wanted to know more about the characters of Charlie & Nicole and the loving past they might have shared.\nThe story lacks clarity on that aspect!\nAs it only focuses on the current state of their broken marriage and therefore the differences which are slowly tearing apart their relationship to a certain point when there's clearly no coming back! But we didn't get to see the good, we don't get to experience the romance, the fun they have had together at the initial stages of their relationship.Nevertheless, it's a journey about divorce, that you would hate to be a part of. Because of how brutally realistic it can get.\nAt the same time it sends a positive message about moving on with your life as well. It raises a strong point about how maturity prevails even in unforeseen circumstances. Despite being a film about separation; it also delivers an intriguing takeaway on unification as well.A film that's heartfelt, deeply saddening to some but certainly worth your time and investment regardless of which place you are coming from. Everyone who is or was in a committed relationship incontestably can relate it to; I assure you that.",

            "content": "I hated this movie. I wanted to review it right after seeing it, but thought I should cool down a bit so I don't come off as simply ranting. It's two weeks later. I haven't cooled down yet. This is a bit of a rant.I definitely don't have the marriage experience under my belt to fully empathize with every situation in the film so there's a bit of distance for me there I suppose. That being said, I absolutely love Ingmar Bergman's Scenes From a Marriage which this film is clearly trying to emulate. In that film, both characters have a believable mix of logic/irrationality in their approach to life in general and specifically their marriage and subsequent divorce and their conflicts are built on true, possibly irreconcilable character differences that have been established instead of random off screen past events or, as is more often the case, nothing. And in Scenes from a Marriage, the audience sees them first as a team in a seemingly very good relationship so when things start to go south they never stop hoping they'll work out in the end. In Marriage Story, I found it hard to care about a failing relationship that I was never invested in to begin with. Also, the story was clearly going for a realistic (maybe gritty is the word) look at marriage and human interaction, and yet every single side character was a, \"how can I be as quirky as possible with my dialogue?\" excuse from the babysitter saying \"You two are so attractive!\" to the social worker being a mute psychopath to all the theater company people being parodies of \"actor-types\" (what a waste of Wallace Shawn). Even the main side characters like Laura Dern and Ray Liotta felt like reductionist portrayals of their types of characters. Johansson's character starts out as a convincing, real-feeling character, but after her \"my husband is great and I'm a dummy\" speech to Laura Dern at the 30 minute mark, her actions become vague and inexplicable and the audience doesn't even get to see her that much. Then she practically becomes the Darth Vader to Laura Dern's Emperor, acting as a proxy antagonist for the entire film as she weaves a web of financial and time inconvenience for our poor poor hero Driver. Her arc felt like a bro-dude at a bar trying to convince his friend that his ex-wife is a itch instead of an honest attempt to craft a character. At the very worst Johansson is intentionally mean, vain, and practically evil. At best she's portrayed as stupid, getting strung along by Dern and only the heroic Driver can see through that. Also Dern's monologue about feminism was nothing that anyone on earth would ever say, it was staggeringly out of place and contrived. And also she bases the entire argument around the \"Judeo-Christian concept of motherhood\" because of The Bible's portrayal of Mother Mary. Too bad the word she was looking for was probably \"Puritanical\" or just \"christian\" since Judaism doesn't give a rats behind about Mary. The beginning of the film practically announces that it will be an even, fair portrayal of two peoples' sides of a divorce via the similar-in-length letter reading, but then Driver becomes the obvious protagonist and the only person who makes even a scrap of sense. And the whole LA vs NY side theme(?) was so shoe-horned and over done, it felt truly childish and the film never even attempts to explore either city as most of it takes place in ugly rooms in a sound stage that could have been shot anywhere. Every time they say \"Let's go to (insert LA location here) they end up going to Pasadena. Every part of LA leads to a space-time portal to gosh dang Pasadena in this movie, they didn't even attempt to get the layout right. And also the entire approach to the film seemed to be \"Let's show divorce from only the scrappy, nitty-gritty legal side,\" which is conceptually interesting, but then they spend so much time with meandering pointless arguments (which is \"realistic\" I suppose) and then don't even show the final court scene. Maybe I'm a terrible person, but I actually cried laughing at the \"every day I wake up and I hope you're dead\" line, I had to pause the movie and rewatch it like five times. They were acting SO HARD.Me cutting down Bombach is less important to how I feel about the movie in general, but the fact that this is based off his own divorce is disturbing. It's hilarious that he divorced Jennifer Jason Leigh who was extremely successful at the time of their divorce, but he portrayed her character as being a loser actress who's only famous because of his work and is in crummy TV shows. On top of that he gave himself a MacArthur genius grant (something his sister has but he does not) which is once again, hilarious. Truly arrogant. And that's another thing, Bombach could not possibly have chosen less relatable characters. A wealthy MacArthur grant arthouse play director and his theatrical partner/TV actress wife. Ah yes, characters for the every-man indeed. And then to bar you further from empathizing with them, he clearly doesn't even understand what being an arthouse theater director would entail and only chose that role because he thought \"hmm I can't make it TOO on the nose so he can't be a film director...he's a play director!\" Ta-dah! The only thing we see him do is make one joke direction, \"do it laying down, but also standing,\" or something quirky like that, and then choosing between two types of stools while he's on the phone. Two...types...of...stools. Two. In Western cinema, cheating on someone has been a standard unforgivable sin since its inception and at the very least something that needs to be directly dealt with and discussed. I have never seen a movie that downplayed infidelity so much, Bombach totally cheated on his wife and was like \"lol what's the big deal?\" and then portrayed it as such. And he didn't even care about the woman he had an affair with, he ignores her through the whole movie and she's portrayed as slightly unattractive which I think in some twisted way is supposed to make that even more OK. Driver's character tries to justify it by reminding Johansson that she didn't have sex with him for a year, a detail I never would have guessed, was never indicated anywhere early in the film, and I totally don't care about. So many of those arguments are just \"emotional exposition,\" characters saying deep, hurtful crap that is nowhere in the film and could have been pulled from any breakup movie. I hear the pain in the actor's voices (they're trying so hard), but I didn't see a scrap of it on screen. Also, Bombach's divorce happened in the 90s, but this movie is set in modern times and the time-stamp discrepancies are so funny. How does Johansson find out about the divorce? \"I saw the emails!\" No one has coordinated a salacious rendezvous via email probably since Bombach went babe hunting on AOL. And they use the kid as a sort of emotional scapegoat, trying to make Driver's character more empathetic by making it seem like he's being such a whiny bum because he loves his kid so much and doesn't want the divorce to hurt the kid, but the kid is practically a lifeless doll. He has no personality and is obviously supposed to be younger than the actor that was cast. Seeing Driver and Johansson struggle to pick up this 100 pound paperweight and act like it's a sweet four year old cherub was one of the great joys of the film. It's like Bombach is an alien who understands that kids=empathy, but doesn't give a damn about his own child enough to portray him with even an ounce of believable personality or emotional stakes (I've never seen a kid, especially that age, give less of a crap about his parents' divorce). And HOLY MOLY, so many on the nose shots that I would have thought myself a genius for coming up with during freshman year of film school and then looked back at my own work a mere month later with unholy shame such as Johansson and Driver slowly closing the big wooden gate together while standing on separate sides of it. Once again, if you want to portray a realistic version of a divorce, you can't smash me over the head with a visual metaphor that weighs more than the empire state building (or the Chinese Theater. Which is better? LA vs NY! Oooo! Art!). And the shot of them all in the bed together filmed so their faces overlap. We get it, you saw Fanny and Alexander. Bombach thinks that mirroring Bergman's cinematography will somehow yield the same results for him, but Bergman's technical approaches to filmmaking is only a means to end in service of creating characters that feel absolutely real, something Bombach knows nothing about.",

            "content": "A deep, raw and absolutely realistic new project by Noah Baumbach at times makes you feel like you are watching a hidden camera show - that's how true and close to reality it is.\nThis film is nothing new, and this story has been told many times before (\"The story of us\", \"Blue Valentine\", \"The Break up\" etc), but i think love can be discussed endlessly and we still won't have a definite answer to what it is. Don't even get me started on marriage...\nThe performances of Scarlett Johansson and Adam Driver are absolutely impeccable. They manage to let you inside the character's head and not only understand the actions, but even feel the way they feel for those 3 hours. Laura Dern was my personal favorite in this film, she was just such a badass, and the monologue about double standards almost had me applaud standing up in my living room.\nWhat i think will make this film stand out for a very long time (as one of the reviews said - something like this only happens once in a lifetime) is that not for one minute did it feel forced in any way. I will specify that every argument, every line of every scene and every pause (even the fighting scene in Charlie's apartment that took 50 takes) was scripted. In movies like this directors and writers often allow the actors to improvise since they get into character so much. But not in this situation. Baumbach has thought every little thing through, every word, every touch and mimic has a meaning. He knew exactly what he wanted to deliver. Charlie's fall on the kitchen floor, the way Nicole talked walking away to the bathroom while first meeting her lawyer - all of these details are there for a reason. The obvious difference we are shown between Nicole - blowing her nose and looking a mess and Nora - strong, independent and flawless (that is what drove Nicole to her, because Nicole wanted to be a woman like that who was standing on her own feet and not living in the shadow of her brilliant husband). This project is very strong and holds its ground and that's the thought i was left with after the film ended.\nI agree with some people - the ending left us in question. But some love stories are never over. And maybe those words that Charlie read about himself will change something, maybe their love will find its way back to them (there must have been a reason he finally moved to LA and she is successful on her own), or maybe they will just manage to stay friends and remain Henry's mom and dad forever. Nobody knows, it's for each of us to decide. But again, this is what sometimes we are left with in life - uncertainty, a little hope for a \"someday\".I hope this film is appreciated and seen for what it is at all the awards and not overlooked because of political/racial/gender dominants that seem to only interest award shows these days.",

            "content": "It's rare that a film's characters feel so lived in, so authentic, so possible. All their flaws are just that, flaws. We all have them, and most of us in excess. This is a fundamental truth which Marriage Story not only understands but embraces. It's refreshing to venture into a story about such a difficult issue that deals with characters who are likable and unlikable simultaneously. A story that places characters at it's center who are conflicted, yet good people at heart.Nicole and Charlie hate each other. They also love each other. They get along in a manageable way, neither one wanting to overstep or make the other feel out of place. Their boundaries are clear yet flexible. These two know each other in the most intimate of ways, something that goes beyond love and romance. They know who the other really is, where their true self resides.Nicole can order a meal or Charlie as if she's ordering for herself, her understanding of who is has become second nature. Charlie will drop what he's doing to fix Nicole's gate, which has been rendered inoperable during a blackout, because he knows it makes her uneasy, it's not even a question of whether he should or not-he knows it's needed. They can do these things for each other even despite being in the middle of a divorce settlement.There's palpable animosity between them, but there is also a deep connection that has formed over a decade of spending their lives together that isn't easily erased. At times, most times, it seems as though neither of them wants this connection to fade, even if they both want their lives to be separate.Nicole feels lost, alone, defeated. She doesn't think of herself as an individual any longer. She's become a nomad in her own head, wandering an unfamiliar landscape that should be intricate and weaved with emotional self awareness. Scarlett Johansson breezes through Marriage Story with a tender grace, a loving touch, the soothing nature of a mother, a woman who has the ability to nurture others yet has forgotten, not only who she is, but how to be a person unto herself.There wasn't a single frame of this film where I felt I was watching Scarlett Johansson playing a character. I was certain I was witnessing some new undiscovered talent named Nicole catching her big break. Her words surge with feeling, her face bares the emotions nakedly and without concern for what others may think. She's captured the essence of a person so fully realized it's difficult to believe she's playing a role of fiction.Charlie feels confused, distraught, guilty. He's captured by his own life and work to the point of not being able to see when others around him are drowning. He, too, has become a wander in a land that is alien, but one he also knows he's visited before. His and Nicole's lives are worked out, set to a schedule and standard he was comfortable with-one he hadn't considered to be prone to disarray. To him, their each good at different things and these opposite qualities balance not just their lives but their entire worlds.He's a man uncomfortable with change, someone who had to struggle greatly to achieve the goals he set for himself. Adam Driver is raw and affecting every second he's on screen. When he hurts we feel his pain, when he cries that emotion wells within us the same. There is no doubt we're watching a documentary about this person's life coming undone.Noah Baumbach allows his lens to linger just as long as is needed to hit us with the punch he's aiming for. He moves in close when his performers are bearing their souls, keeping us near the action so we know it's real. He's talented enough to allow the range of his collaborators to reach their limits, and conscious enough to know when to pull back and move on. His instinctual ability to capture the essence of a character is the mark of an actor's director. His screenplay pops with energy when needed and allows us to feel a deep brooding undercurrent of a forthcoming boiling point.He's not content to just make a film about two people falling away from each other. No, he's striving for something far more complex. He set his sights on telling a story where the characters don't have to be loved or hated for their points of view to make sense or be felt, and yet he still manages to make us feel both of those emotions throughout the film.Marriage Story is crafted with the utmost care. The technique of it's creator is working at the highest level of this craft. Baumbach's performers grab us by the face, staring intently into our eyes, and scream at us that this is a story worth telling, worth experiencing, and it's alright to swept up in it. This isn't an easy topic to discuss. Divorces often become messy and those involved lose sight of the fact that the person opposite them was someone they had a real closeness to at one time. Handling a film like this in such a fresh way would be a challenge for anyone to direct, write, or perform, and lucky for us this one was taken on by three supremely capable talents.",

From the beginning it's sad to know the little things that are going to be used against each other eventually.We get a whole range of the emotional turmoil from some ironically funny moments to the big quarrel between the pair which is quite devastating. Surprisingly the child seems the least scathed in the battle.Scarlett does a good job of acting genuinely sad. You feel for her. Adam Driver gives a tour de force performance. His strong personality works in this movie and his emotions on screen are so accessible to the audience.A must watch. Be prepared to be left sad but enlightened.",

            "content": "Noah Baumbach's latest drama focuses on themes that will resonate with many as he delves into the emotional story of love and divorce, comparable with the Oscar winning Kramer Vs Kramer.\nAfter an effective opening voiceover scene where both Charlie (Driver) & Nicole (Johansson) tell us why they love each other we are then jarringly dropped into a therapist's room where both protagonists are in the midst of their early divorce proceedings. As the divorce intensifies for the custody of their young son so did its impact on me. It takes a while for the fireworks to get going but once Laura Dern weaves her manipulative lawyer's web, removing the amicable intentions from both parties we then get a phenomenal performance from Adam Driver in quite possibly a career best performance as he tries to deal with the underhanded tactics from the lawyer. Johansson is also in fine form but this is undeniably Driver's film. A scene where they try and talk their predicament out amicably but spirals out of control into a slanging match of insults until the emotive conclusion was my favourite scene. Hard to watch but utterly compelling thanks to both lead actors.\nMy only negative was Azhy Robertson who played the son in the midst of the tug of war custody battle. He was excruciatingly annoying and unconvincing.\nMarriage Story is crafted perfectly at the hands of Baumbach who knows how to give us family drama with his eyes shut (see The Squid & The Whale). One of the best dramas I've seen this year that made me shed a tear at the very end.",

            "content": "This movie has been on my watchlist for a while and I regret not watching it sooner.It's honestly a little difficult to find bad things about this movie. I loved that the movie has a theatre vs tv focus to it as it creates a natural hierarchical relationship between Nicole (Scarlett Johansson) and Charlie (Adam Driver), our main characters. The geographical setting between LA and NYC also act as a device for characterization and try to highlight the difference between them.Johansson and Driver both showcased captivating performance, with some beautifully written lines throughout. I'm not sure if I could say that they had chemistry as a couple (perhaps this was intentional - if they felt like they had too much chemistry, divorce aspect could have been challenging to convince to the audience) but they did feel like a real couple during their fighting scene. Honestly, not a single cast in this movie was lacking in any sense. I thought they were all extremely convincing, especially the lawyers (Laura Dern, Alan Alda, Ray Liotta). I also thought the movie was very comical when it needed to be with scenes like when the theatre company just gossips in full volume. Noticed great subtle cinematography with scenes like Charlie and Nicole closing a door between them.The ending scene at the end where Nicole ties Charlie's shoes is a key scene. It communicates to the audience that even after a divorce, you may not be in love with your ex-partner, but you could still love them. The old saying \"Don't be sad because it's over; Be happy cause it happened\" is cliche but really felt suitable in this movie.\"Marriage Story\" is closer to \"Divorce Story\" because most of the movie does narrate around the plight of divorce rather than the happiness of marriage. It's very difficult to be fair to both sides institutionally and it can definitely cause some damage to the child if there is one in the picture. But in the end, I think the movie is titled \"Marriage Story\" because every good story needs a good ending. How you handle that ending may show what the whole story was like. People may end up in different places in after a divorce, but at least this movie highlights that no matter how messy the process was, the end result can still be ok and leave you with lasting complex emotions. I've never been married and I don't feel like I have ever loved to this depth. But \"Marriage Story\" still managed to make me experience a glimpse of those complex emotions.",

Something has happened & we never get a definitive cause as to the genesis of their breakup but when civility starts to crumble (they're hoping to negotiate the divorce on their own for peace of mind & their young son) but when accusations & resentments begin to surface, lawyers are engaged (she has Laura Dern in her corner while he gets Alan Alda & Ray Liotta). What follows is a modern update of Kramer Vs. Kramer (Best Picture winner 40 years ago) in which words do strike blows (their final verbal brush-up is more potent & devastating than any cinematic gunfight witnessed in some time). Baumbach, as always is a master of character & situation, as he has always mined the humor found in the most debase of scenarios. Who knows if the director's real life break-up w/actress Jennifer Jason Leigh (she is a celebrated actress from the West Coast) inspired the proceedings here but one hopes a lot of the emotional carnage on display is pure supposition. Also starring Merritt Weaver (as ScarJo's sister), Julie Hagerty (nice to see her again, this time playing the mother who doesn't favor sides) & Wallace Shawn (\"Inconceivable!\") playing an actor in Driver's troupe.",

But the exploration of the divorce, how both parties behave and react to all the legal proceedings take place were really interesting and thought provoking. Baumbach's screenplay is also fantastic, the arguments in this film felt authentic and real, and was extremely confronting to watch at times. There is one scene in particular which I truly believe is the best scene i have experienced in the past 5 years. I loved this film and found it emotionally gripping and feels like a piece of work so personal that I felt that only Baumbach could pull off this film the way he did.The only nitpicky thing I have with this film is in the beginning some of the scenes are a little on the long side and draw out for too long, however I think this was due to the fact that I hadn't connected with the characters yet and wasn't as immersed as I was until the film started building momentum, however when it does get the momentum the nitpicks I had at the start weren't even worth worrying about.Marriage Story is one of the best films this year showcasing absolutely world class acting, directing and writing.

Sadly, the script did not work out to create an convincing setting for the story about the divorcing of a grownup couple. I did not understand, why the lawyers got such an important part in the story. The static camera work did not help either, and so did not the clean stage setting. Also the television aspect ratio of 16:9 freezes the acting in a narrow space too small for the big screen. Maybe this movie works out in a better way as Netflix stream on Iphones.

Presenting the complex issues of modern day relationships and breakdowns and legal ramifications is so refreshing. Having lived through this situation twice, once as a stepparent and then a parent, this story was so distressing to sit through. It's the age related dilemma of our sad times.The absent father is a 30 to 40 year old myth, as is the notion that women are held to a higher account. If anything, today one of the sexes are able to get away with literally anything and any differantation being brought into question is seen as sexism. At least in the media and popular entertainment world. The law sees it differently.\nChild neglect and abuse is committed by both parents equally which can be verified in the data, depending where you look. Even then its pretty close to equal. Not what the haters want you to believe.The real perpetrators here is the system, which seeks a win for clients over the needs of children and emotional and financial wellbeing of parents. It's responsible for literally driving people past the edge. Choose any Western nation and you will find pretty much the same story. Divisiveness kills. Children are all too often put second, but as is depicted very intelligently by its writer, sometimes there is no clear solution.To have this film released in 2019 is astounding and couldn't be more needed. This is the messy reality of life. Not the Shangri La fantasy that self interested groups aspire to create. More understanding and unity and less demonization. We must learn to give a little, if not a lot, and learn to get along. This is the most important film for many years.\nRodney King's cry for peace echoes on.",

This is The Squid and the Whale, but substitute Adam Driver for Jeff Daniels, and Scarlett Johansson for Laura Linney.

The script is terrific-----so true to life and . . . at the risk of sounding corny----honest.This movie, unless your heart is made of stone and unless you've never really had a partner you truly loved, will have you riding a rollercoaster of emotions.

Kramer,\" the story is portrayed in the modern lifestyle.The greatest virtues of the film are the performances from the lead, Amy Driver in a very restrained and spontaneous role, and terrific Scarllet Johanson as a candid woman with a bit of attitude. The drama has a freshness and is moving despite a bit of its slow beginning. Despite its overall charm, the fight between the couple in the apartment is a bit overly done, screaming and banging for the Oscars what it overall seems. Following the films like \"Kramer Vs.

            "content": "\"Marriage Story\" stars Adam Driver and Scarlett Johansson as a married couple who are at the end of their marriage - Scarlett's character, Nicole, wants to go out on her own and make a real life for herself where she doesn't feel like she's under her husband's shadow. Her husband, Charlie, found success with his newest play that he directed, and is preparing his cast and crew for their Broadway premier. Charlie and Nicole are going in two separate directions - and with their young boy in the middle, the long, arduous process of divorce begins. And we get to witness every minute of it.With a premise that's ripe to be used to pull at the viewers heartstrings and subject them to two hours of emotional abuse, \"Marriage Story\" is instead a surprisingly tender and touching story about a couple that still deeply cares for each other, even in the midst of their separation. There is no Oscar-baity, overindulgent tragedy porn here - instead, you get a nuanced and well-balanced story that feels true to life in its premise, if not totally in its thematic execution.Adam Driver and Scarlett Johansson gave incredibly dedicated performances that, I imagine, must've taken some sort of emotional toll. It wasn't easy to watch them as a couple that is unraveling at the seams, and it probably wasn't easy for them to play these roles, either. Both of them give very understated performances where the emotion is mostly hidden inside and brought out through facial reactions, actions, or the lack thereof. When words are thrown, they can be used as weapons, readily fired to inflict emotional harm on their opponents. And while the verbal battles made for good viewing, my only complaint about them is that, at times, the dialogue did feel like dialogue, and did not feel very natural - this movie has a decidedly cinematic tone in it's dialogue, and doesn't necessarily feel realistic. In this case, I didn't see that as much of a problem, as the story beats and performances as a whole certainly did feel realistic.Director Noah Baumbach crafts \"Marriage Story\" with an almost theatrical flair, which is fitting, as Adam Driver portrays a theatre director in the film. And what I mean by this is that the movie can feel like it's going from scene to scene without much finality or resolution - at many times during the movie, a scene will transition to another with a simple fade out and fade in. The constant usage of this did slightly bother me, as many scenes did feel like much more could be explored, and instead they would simply, and literally, fade away to another sequence. However, this didn't detract from the overall story the movie is telling, which is a good thing because the story does come full circle in an emotionally satisfying way.This is not a movie that sets out to break your heart, and oddly, this is almost an uplifting movie in many ways. \"Marriage Story\" is a film that may make you cry, but ultimately tries to show you the humanity and love in situations that are seen as the pinnacle of sadness.",

Two very good actors in what seems to be the perfect stage to show what they are able to do, a movie about divorce and family which instantly reminds you of Kramer vs. Kramer.For a long time this movie is very dry but I think this intended as part of the evolution of the story. Both parents in the beginning try to handle the divorce as if it is not a big thing and thus even though it is a drama it lacks exactly that, the drama.\nBut while building to the climax there all these little details that will get call backs later and you get to the insanity of the legal procedure that comes with divorce. Even though I never got divorced it feels like this is very accurate description. At the end it comes full circle and gets more emotional and dramatic and this where the movie finally got me.So I don't think this is anything like masterpiece. It is a good movie with two outstanding performances even though I feel like Driver stands out a little more. I'll get why it builds to a climax and thus before that keeps more calm but this made me feel less interested and I believe that getting a divorce with a kid and custody claims will be nothing but emotional from beginning to the end and Marriage Story really becomes gripping in the last third of the movie.",

With the passage of time Charlie grows prolific with fame, maturity and authority, whilst Nicole settles down to become the leading lady of his productions and creative pursuits, living his dreams as hers too. For many years, she remains agnostic to her own aspirations, becoming Charlie's muse, wife, a mother to the lovable Henry and a caring housewife.It's business as usual until Nicole realizes that she has sacrificed far too much of her own self for Charlie but the latter has taken her devotion for granted. In the process, she has lost her individuality and almost forgotten who she actually is, and he doesn't care. She decides to file for divorce from Charlie amid the seemingly happy and stable status, taking him off guard completely. Marriage Story is a narrative of the common people shaken up by the disruption of a happy matrimony and a humdrum life. It is a deep dive into the character of a stereotypically patriarchal and almost misogynistic head of the family who believes everything is normal as long as the family seems to be happy and old, unfulfilled promises made aren't being dug into. It is also about the predicament of a child who is facing a family meltdown, watching helplessly as the parents drift apart.The treatment of the sombre subject by the writer and director Noah Baumbach is the strength of Marriage Story, it is kept natural, sans melodrama. Adam Driver and Scarlett Johansson bring out the depths of their respective characters with ease and conviction. The sequence where the couple finally confronts each other releasing the pent up agony and frustration is hugely believable and poignant. Laura Dern's essay of Nicole's lawyer Nora Fanshaw is sterling, especially the scene where she counsels Nicole about the perceptions about mothers and their model code of conduct.",

Not alive.\" The irony is stark when his wife (Johansson) parted ways because she could not feel 'alive' as her dreams in LA are smothered by Charlie's ego and work, where her frustrations are drily vented through Sondheim's other number 'You could drive a person crazy'. The acerbic wit is reminiscent of a Woody Allen movie, but Noah Baumbach's nuanced dissection of the emotional upheavals in a divorce and the bitterness in fighting for custody is gut-wrenchingly raw and humanistic. While Johansson galvanizes with visceral angst and grief from her personal experiences, Driver's performance carries not one false note as he navigates the pain of connecting with his son and coming to terms with his flaws. Laura Dern channels Renata Klein as a divorce attorney, who gives the story a feminist edge with a snarky take on how mothers are expected to be perfect. Together with the solid supporting cast including the bullish Ray Liotta and the wry Alan Alda - along with Randy Newman's romantic score, this union lifts Marriage Story to be a tender and affecting portrait of the complexities of co-parenting, of how we can begin our relationships with love - and end them with grace.",

I didn't know much about Marriage Story, and just by the title I thought it would be a romantic drama, but it was far from it. Marriage Story talks about a situation that is far too common, and it's told very realistically which makes this film extremely relatable for most adults.Although Marriage Story is a long movie, you never get bored; you're entertained in a weird way. A major pro that makes Marriage Story so realistic is the screenplay. Marriage Story touches on everything about divorces, the toxic lawyers, the sadness, the arguments, and the awkwardness. One thing that surprised me was how humorous Marriage Story is. There are these insane arguments within the movie, but somehow there's comedy that actually makes you laugh. With all these different emotions happening within two hours, Marriage Story becomes an emotional roller coaster.The acting was done way too well; the crying is what made the movie feel real. Adam Driver and Scarlett Johansson prove that they can act their heart out in Marriage Story. They both portray these emotions that are so hard to act out, like awkwardness and anger. Noah Baumbach did a great job with developing the characters, making them like real people, with flaws and weaknesses that both destroy and maintain a marriage.Marriage Story is film that I strongly recommend. It pulls all the emotions in the book, and it plays with those emotions constantly throughout the runtime. The screenplay was excellent by creating these characters that you would only meet in real life. The dialogue and acting also improved the viewing experience. So go ahead and enjoy Marriage Story, it's definitely an experience that's worthy having.",

            "content": "Here's my review of ' Marriage story ' . So marriage story is directed by Noah baumbach known for his intense family dramas and frequent writing collaborations with Wes Anderson himself. The movie stars Adam Driver and Scarlett Johannson and it's about this couple going through a divorce . That's just about it. Sounds like a simple indie movie with a lot of crying and Keith urban in the background right ? Nope. This movie is very human and tries to tell a story which hits you with reality on every level , and the last time a movie did that was ' the pursuit of happiness ' . All the actors in this movie were great ! And added so much depth to the characters they played. Now the audience are like little kids not knowing whose side to take during the divorce cause both of them have strong points on their side that you don't know who to root for. The courtroom scenes and the lawyer's entry into this mutual consent makes it very intense at times. I should have said this earlier but Adam driver and Scarlett Johannson were amazing in this movie to the point that you don't know whether they're acting or not and I'm not even exaggerating . The dialogue feels very real and so does the overall environment . It's also masterfully shot and beautifully scored and it's one of the best movies I've seen this year which isn't part of a franchise or an adaptation of a comic book or video game. In the end 'Marriage story' Is a hard hitting tale with powerful acting , life like dialogue , an engaging narrative and proof that when reality hits , it hits hard.",

            "content": "SCORE: 10/10Simple, raw, real.Considering about 60% of marriages end in divorce nowadays, this is about as Indie as you can get. I found myself craving a bit more in the drama department throughout the movie, until I realized the magic that was happening in front of my eyes. This was not supposed to be some over dramatic piece that capitalized on every little part to the point where it was borderline unrealistic. So much of this film's success can be attributed to how realistic it all was and the simplicity of the plot.There were many lessons to be taken from this movie, but none more powerful than the importance of communication. This story makes you realize how much of people's issues boil down to the lack of and unwillingness to communicate one's thoughts and feelings to those they love. We expect others to be able to read our minds and to have the same thought process as us when it comes to things that are important to us. One of the most powerful lines in the entire movie comes from Laura Dern's character when she calls out Charlie by saying \"So when it comes to what you want, it's a decision, but when it comes to what she wants, it's a discussion\". So many of us live in our own world and act selfishly to the point where we completely lose touch with those around us. We get caught up in achieving what we want in life that we are willing to steamroll through anyone that gets in our way, including those people who mean the most to us. It starts small, but over time becomes a back and forth where each person is acting selfishly and judging the other person in silence, building up a log of issues they will never communicate with each other. After a while, people hit a breaking point and things get nasty.As the divorce lawyers were saying, criminal lawyers see bad people at their worst and divorce lawyers see good people at their worst. It's amazing how quickly people who love each other can turn on each other and make the other person go from the love of their life to the worst person in existence. It is human instinct to go into defense mode when dealing with relationships that mean a lot when things aren't going well. The build up of tension between Charlie and Nicole was perfectly executed, slowly adding more layers as we learned more about why their relationship wasn't working, all the way up until one of the most amazing scenes I've ever witnessed. The final fight between Charlie and Nicole was absolutely gut wrenching and fully displayed the breaking point that lives within all of us. We see Charlie exclaim his final line about wishing she would just die after everything she put him through, making him physically and mentally break down to the lowest point of human form. It was perfect. He falls to the floor, clearly physically and mentally broken, and lets out an apology in his biggest moment of weakness. At that point, he realized the magnitude of his emotions and the situation. It was one of the best displays of acting I've ever seen.Speaking of acting, Adam Driver and Scarlett Johansson are responsible for making this film so raw and real. Each of them was able to portray their character perfectly and contribute equally to the powerful messages and story. The last part where Charlie is reading the letter Nicole wrote at the beginning got me so bad. The perfect ending. I want to say much more about this movie but I feel like I will never be able to completely capture the impact it has. It's one of those movies you just have to watch to fully understand and feel the power of human emotion.",

Although these combating former partners are no longer right for each other, they still mean a great deal to one another. Marriage Story examines the complexities of relationships, the shortcomings of our divorce system, and the process of rebuilding. It expresses extreme emotional vulnerability yet finds moments of genuine levity as well. Plus, the performances of Johansson and Driver (and Dern) are absolutely electric, making Marriage Story a perfect storm of relatability and empathy. Viewers are guaranteed to feel something.Meanwhile, the careful craft behind Marriage Story highlights its strengths. The reserved editing holds on actors for extended lengths, letting their authentic performances erupt uncut. The cinematography uses physical barriers to symbolize emotional distance, while maintaining an unrefined style that feels intimate and natural. The music is minimal (allowing focus to remain on the actors) yet distinctly fits the melancholy tone. Similarly, the sound design is quiet, helping the emotional beats echo loudly. Lastly, the direction unites these aspects into a delicately balanced bittersweet mood that strikes the heart. Overall, Marriage Story is an emotional masterpiece.Writing: 10/10\nDirection: 9/10\nCinematography: 9/10\nActing: 10/10\nEditing: 9/10\nSound: 8/10\nScore/Soundtrack: 9/10\nProduction Design: 7/10\nCasting: 9/10\nEffects: 7/10Overall Score: 8.7/10.",

It's very hard for me to be partial in a movie with Adam Driver but I'm doing my best.I have to start by stressing here that this movie is certainly a movie I'd rather have seen in the movies and I'm not sure why. I saw Irishman at home and unlike this movie I was able to connect a lot more at home but this is probably a problem with me.This movie is from Noah Baumbach who wrote with Wes Anderson, The Fantastic Mr. Fox, one of my favorite animations. Here he brings a very different movie and without being able to say even a little personal. Its direction is wonderful, with perfect sequential plans, especially with the character of Scarlett Johansson, and a very striking soundtrack. The color palette he used here is very beautiful, with more vivid colors when showing a family moment and more neutral colors when showing the couple fighting or moments of anger.One of the problems I had with the movie was the lack of charisma of the characters but that is saved by the beautiful performances of the actors.\nI have to admit I cried a little.

            "content": "This movie tackles the complexity of divorce without pulling any punches. Where this move excels is it's raw approach to the ugliness of separation and how even the most genuinely kind people can turn into the worst version of themselves all for the sake of a \"win\". Adam Driver and Scarlett Johansson deliver strong, believable performances of a married couple who became a union for their own selfish reasons but likely had no business even dating letting alone getting married.Where this movie tends to fail however, despite it's title, is in the actual story. There's just no real direction or goal to what goes on here. Nicole, (Johansson's character) does a brief overview of what brought them together and broke them up. But the true lynchpin of what destroyed them, is for whatever reason a bit of an afterthought, only mentioned sparingly throughout the film. At times they seem like they're on the verge of saying \"let's just make this work\" only to wipe it all away with something truly awful said or done.Once you kinda know where this story is headed which is fairly early into the second act, while intriguing, you're kinda just waiting to see how it'll all play out and it begins to drag. Some scenes are either needlessly elongated or completely unnecessary altogether. I do however absolutely love the \"real life\" comedy that happens. They did really well with making funny moments seem natural.The strength and weakness of this movie is in its realness. Our lives are real and art tries like hell to imitate it, only to realize not every waking moment of it is even remotely entertaining. This movie seems to wallow in these moments of realness that don't happen to necessarily be entertaining and it's where this movie sags.I enjoyed Marriage Story thoroughly and after seeing this and finally seeing \"Her\", I've grown a full blown new respect for Scarlett Johansson's acting prowess. But this movie lacks a true point and seems to only hinge itself on something (married or not) we all know too well; the pain of separating from someone you once immensely cared about. It relates greatly enough to pull you in for the duration, but upon reflection, you realize it's not as great as it seems. Seems to be more anguish for the sake of anguish, rather than anguish to illustrate a point. Don't get me wrong, there are revelations to be had, but without a true direction in this movie, you're kind left wondering what the point of it all even was, especially factoring in the \"ending\". If you can call it that.",

Their jobs get in the way from them trying to be a parent and when getting divorced they use that against you. This movies screenplay alone is what makes this movie. The dialogue is almost perfect. I don't see this movie losing in the Oscar Screenplay category.(unless another great writer, Tarantino, wins). Even though I think Adam Driver gives his best performance of his Career in this movie. I do think he loses to Joaquin at the Oscars. Scarlett who is strong, gives another STRONGER performance in a different movie this year.

And my parents split 40 years ago. It's so good I almost wish I hadn't watched it.The film is evenhanded overall, but I agree with those who, if they have to choose a side, go with Adam Driver's Charlie. Scarlett Johanssen's Nicole has felt like second fiddle in her marriage for years and once she moves to LA with their boy, she's clearly relishing being in control of the situation. She's continually deceiving Charlie and springing things on him: from hiring an aggressive divorce lawyer, for example, when they'd agreed not to use lawyers, to barring him from planned family activities with their son.Nicole herself would probably argue that Charlie insensitively disregarded her wants for years, but that bad behavior would not justify hers. Two wrongs do not make a right, and his behavior was not in the service of separating a parent from their child.",

The musical score by Randy Newman underlines the drama without ever inundating it, and the cinematography by Robbie Ryan is exemplary.But in the end the kudos belong to Noah Baumbach: he has created an important and impressive film that will likely become the definitive dissection of marriage and divorce and the lasting glue of family.

            "review_title": "Baumbach's chronicle of escalating stakes in divorce war hits the mark!",
            "content": "With Marriage Story, Noah Baumbach has cemented his reputation as one of the more sophisticated screenwriters in Hollywood today. His film however should be more appropriately titled, \"Divorce Story,\" as his narrative is basically a distillation of the unraveling of a marriage. The couple in question is Nicole and Charlie, played with subtlety by Scarlett Johansson and Adam Driver. Their battle is over where their 8 year-old son Henry should be growing up-east or west coast, as it turns out.\nThe film begins on a deliciously ironic note. We're treated to sets of voice overs from each of the principals, extolling the virtues of each others' personalities. On the surface it appears the marriage has not unraveled at all-yet.\nBut as the camera pulls back, Nicole and Charlie are in a marriage counselor's office, reading off their assignments from the counselor-to praise each other, in an attempt to find common ground. But it's also immediately made clear that each party feels the marriage is irretrievably lost, despite the positive pronouncements in these essays they've been reading, in the opening sequence.\nWe soon learn that Nicole, a talented actress, has supported Charlie, an up and coming director who runs his own theater company.in New York City. When Nicole has the opportunity to work on a pilot for a new TV show in Los Angeles, Charlie is under the impression that she and Henry will be returning to New York, after the TV opportunity wraps up-soon he discovers his assumption was incorrect (to put it mildly).\nBaumbach's focus is not primarily on the warring couple and their disagreement-that no doubt would not work for an entire movie. He draws the battle lines clearly, however: Nicole wants Charlie to recognize her quest for independence-and she ultimately intends to remain in LA with their child, where she has the opportunity to flower. Charlie can't countenance her demand, as his burgeoning career is wrapped up in everything New York City.\nIt's how Baumbach chronicles the growing animus between them and the escalating conflict which proves so successful--coupled with how the deteriorating conflict proceeds in gripping increments, At first, the couple has agreed that they'll work the divorce out amicably-without attorneys present.\nAll bets are off however when Nicole is introduced to Nora (a deliriously fine Laura Dern), as the ball-busting divorce attorney, who's an expert at representing female clients. Charlie, still hesitant about enlisting an attorney, briefly flirts with hiring Jay (a thoroughly believable Ray Liotta), the attack-dog attorney who charges over $900 per hour. Soon after learning from Nora he's in jeopardy of losing custody of Henry and most of his earnings, Charlie finally conscripts Bert Spitz (Alan Alda), who urges him to cut his losses and allow Nicole to keep Henry in LA.\nThe stakes are exacerbated when Charlie drops Spitz and takes on Jay, who, in one of the best scenes in the film, duels with Nora in court, over Henry's fate. The judge ends up appointing an evaluator who will observe both parties in their interactions with Henry.\nThe family court evaluation ends up in disaster for Charlie, who ends up cutting himself (and bleeding profusely) with his small pocketknife which he carries around habitually on a key chain (it doesn't help that the female evaluator is completely unemotional). This probably leads to Charlie throwing in the towel at film's end and agreeing to Nicole's demand to keep their child on the west coast.\nWe can only conclude that Baumbach has done a bravura job in researching the vagaries of the divorce system-his superb characterizations of the attorneys involved are what ultimately give the film its compelling impetus.\nMarriage Story is also a character study-not only the chronicle of Nicole's quest for independence but Charlie finally realizing that his demand to have Nicole and Henry return to NYC was tied to narcissistic careerism (Charlie eventually ends up in LA anyway, working as a university lecturer).\nBaumbach also insightfully presents Nicole and Charlie's conflict as not entirely hateful. Even in Charlie's worst moment, when he has a meltdown in which he expresses his unbridled hatred for Nicole-there are still tender moments between them (as Charlie falls to his knees sobbing, Nicole cradles his head in her arms).\nBaumbach's direction is so good due to his all-star cast. Some of the scenes could have moved a little quicker and one wonders why he inserted such a self-indulgent scene where he has Driver sing that entire Sondheim song from Company at the nightclub.. But these are minor peccadillos, as Marriage Story turns out to be one of the top films of 2019, certainly worthy of a best picture Oscar nomination, at the very least.",

            "review_title": "90 Minute Build-Up to a Career Best Scene for Both Driver and Johansson",
            "content": "An emotional drama about a divorce is not exactly the kind of plot I usually go for, but what immediately struck me about Marriage Story was the quintessential feeling Baumbach brings to all his films. He has an unparalleled talent in tapping into real life and writing dialogue that feels so incredibly natural and authentic that it makes it easy to forget you're watching a movie at all. We're immediately sucked into the life and relationship of Charlie and Nicole with a monologue each about they love about one another. This is probably the happiest and most uplifting the movie gets. As soon as we're dragged back to the marriage counselling, the bitterness starts to creep in and we're pushed down an ever-winding helter skelter. Once Nicole employs a ruthless lawyer to oversee the divorce, things between them get uglier than ever, and our preconceived notions of who they are and what they meant to each other degrades at a phenomenal speed.Almost all of Baumbach's films revolve around the concept of communication, or more accurately miscommunication, and Marriage Story is no different. It's fundamentally about a couple who couldn't clearly communicate their wants and needs to one another, and continue to miscommunicate in their break-up. They use lawyers as mouthpieces, saying things and asking for things they don't actually want. They remain polite and nice to each other, holding back their feelings, and letting it build to silent resentment. This all starts from the beginning, with Nicole refusing to read her love letter out to Charlie, and later taking his notes on the chin and bursting into tears as soon as she turns the corner.And this miscommunication builds and builds and builds in intensity until it has to explode, and it does so in full force right in front of the screen. The pivotal argument in Charlie's apartment single-handedly changed my opinion of this entire movie, and will be used from here on out as a display of how insanely talented both Adam Driver and Scarlett Johansson are in front of the camera. All the truths between them are laid bare in a verbally violent altercation of the ages, in a single long shot. And yet neither Driver nor Johansson stutter or fall into caricature. They deliver their lines with equal intensity both rage and misery, and it's hard not to feel for both of them and what they've been through together and individually. So intense is the scene that I actually had to take a deep breath afterwards to compose myself. It's so viscerally raw and emotional to watch that I felt drained and overwhelmed by the time it was over.It goes without saying, but this film was a career best for both Driver and Johansson, each of them slipping into their roles so easily it felt like they were just playing themselves re-enacting difficult parts of their own lives. If I had to pick, Driver gave the best performance, if only because he was given more space to do so. By the movie's mid-point, we definitely spend more time with Charlie than we do Nicole, and Driver makes use of every second. The argument is definitely the high point, for both of them, but Johansson also gets her own monologue to Laura Dern's Nora which is just as emotionally stirring, while Driver gets a subdued but heavy rendition of 'Being Alive' from the musical 'Company', as well as a heartbreaking scene at the end when their son Henry finds the love letter Nicole wrote about him.As for complaints, in the lead-up to the argument, the movie was starting to lose me. I wasn't bored or finding it slow or dull, nor did I find any of the filmmaking aspects bad or hard to watch. But I found myself just getting so irrationally angry at the whole situation. From a purely factual standpoint, Charlie was the b*stard of the relationship. He was controlling and selfish, and a cheater on top of that. And yet putting Charlie front and centre for much of the movie just made me feel sorry for him. He was blindsided by the divorce, blindsided by Nora's ruthlessness, and blindsided by the financial cost it would have on him, all set on him by Nicole. It becomes very telling how semi-autobiographical this movie is of Baumbach's own divorce, acknowledging he was the cheater, but framing the story in such a way it lays most of the sympathy on his surrogate character, and the hardships Charlie has to go through at Nicole's behest. Putting Nicole behind the scenes for this portion of the movie, and essentially cutting out her side, really made her come off as the resentful b*tch putting Charlie through hell. The fact the movie makes a point that the blame can be laid on both sides almost makes this facet worse. If Nicole had just communicated her problems and desires more clearly and accurately, Charlie wouldn't have had to upend his life against his will and lose almost everything he earned. But I mean, as complaints go, I get the impression this was somewhat intentional on Baumbach's behalf. This was the point. He wants it to seem unfair, he wants it messy and his characters to both look terrible, he wants you angry at the system and how easily exploited it is at one party's loss.I have no hands-on experience with divorce, but I found way too much of it relatable. We saw our sons in Henry, and we saw each other in Charlie and Nicole, but if nothing else, this movie just strengthened our relationship, showing us how bad things can get if we don't communicate properly and compromise for one another. But it's not a movie I could watch again. It's a hard pill to swallow, and as electrifying as both Driver and Johansson are, it's not enough to endure all that rage and misery again. Currently I'm sitting on a solid 8/10, but that argument scene was so...so...intense that I'm going to give it a whole point to itself. I give Marriage Story a 9/10. I'd advise grabbing a box of tissues before you begin.",

It promises you a serious insight into a divorce between two good, well-meaning people, but its attempts at comedy fell flat and were hard to watch. Particularly with that over-acting, trying-too-hard performance by Merrit Wever, who came off as more of a cartoonish stage actress and whose character was more of a caricature.There were also lines that were just bad and poorly delivered. Like one toward the start of the film where the babysitter says to them upon their return home \"God, you guys are so attractive.\" What? Nobody talks like that in that context. Little things like that make one wonder if the writer/director even bothered to get any second opinions.Driver and Johansenn did most of the heavy-lifting acting-wise, which gives us small windows of hope, but even so, their on-screen chemistry seemed forged and unnatural.Overall, this movie came off as more of a vanity project than anything else.

However, it opened to an overwhelming account of acclaim, especially for its acting and screenplay, which encouraged me to watch it earlier than planned.And while it takes a while to really get into, the 'while' that it takes is worth it, as the film becomes better, and better, and better. This film is not clich\u00e9. Nor is it sappy. If anything, it is easily one of the most realistic films I have ever watched in my life. Seeing as the director, Noah Baumbach, famously went through a real-life divorce with actress Jennifer Jason-Leigh, I think it's safe to assume he used many of the emotions experienced to his benefit in this film.I have said before about films being so immersive that I forgot I was watching a film, but never have I meant it more than in here. Every single line is so life-like, and the performances show happiness, annoyance, frustration, distress, anger and more in such on-point ways, that I forgot this film starred people like Johannson, Driver, Dern and Liotta. I just saw them as characters. Something else I have to point out is the eight-year old character of Henry. Characters of this age are really hard to write, as you can write them like they're way too young and immature, or older than they're actually meant to be. In this film, however, the character was written with enough comprehension of his surroundings for an eight-year old, but with also enough innocence and naivety of other people's feelings. Azhy Robertson, who plays this character, also gives an exactly on-point performance that can rival with that of the leads.But it's not just it's incredibly realistic acting and script. The sensitive way in which this film is directed, with the positions characters are in the scene, the colours around them, the production design and more, all add up to it's emotion as well. The film juggles a variety of tones, ranging from drama and courtroom-intrigue to comedy and quirkiness, while it never seems uneven. All the tones just blend in with each-other so well and everything just adds on to everything else. There are so many memorable scenes, that perfectly capture the right mood and feel, whether it be shocking, disturbing, sad, awkward, angering or funny. In addition to this: the editing was perhaps even more outstanding. Every timing of every cut is perfectly realised to show the specific reactions of characters to the specific actions of other characters and you barely realise when the shots are going from long-shots to close-ups because it's so gradual and in-the-moment.The music was also handled brilliantly, both in the way characters sing, as well as the half-melancholy, half straight-out depressing background composition.CONCLUSION:\nPassionately acted, outstandingly written, and sensitively directed, 'Marriage Story' is easily one of the most realistic and touching films I have ever seen.",

I am mesmerized by that man, his realness, rawness and his theatricality. Laura Dern is good spice to the story. And Scarlett, I must say, this is the first role in which I saw her in a new light, as a serious actress, she has that in her definitely. Nicole's (Scarlett's) mother and sister are also interesting roles, I know that actress who plays the sister from Unbelievable, she is very good at that show. This is a love story about divorce. But it is more than just that. Directing and screenplay are fantastic. I am just going to say - who loved Kramer vs. Kramer is going to love this one too.",

I never fathomed how hard it is to leave your partner but also maintain a good enough relationship for your child. To be completely selfish yet selfless at the same time. Marriage Story has opened my eyes to what 50% of marriages go through.The pacing was amazing. I loved the editing style and the flow of the story. Adam Driver and Scarlett Johansson were very convincing and absolutely killed their roles. Fantastic screenplay. There were multiple scenes where I really felt so deep in my soul it gave me shivers. Such a raw performance. I haven't stopped looping the scene of Adam Driver singing \"Being Alive\" because it was so goddamn beautiful.If I were to nitpick and find a weakness in this film, I would have to say it was dialogue-heavy and lacked quiet scenes. There wasn't much time for the audience to digest the powerful scenes. Other than that, it was an amazing film that lived up to its high rating. Although I've watched a few films after watching this at 3 am in my bed, I can't stop thinking about it. I guess film twitter really did hype up a great film.",

I was one over with the opening monologues from each of the main characters. Adam Drivers performance was breathtaking, really showing us his full range as on actor. His argument with Scarlett johansson in the backend of the film had so much rage, despair and pain that I felt for his character as the film was building. Scarlett johansson's performance was very good also (much better than Jojo Rabbit, still trying to see how that got a nomination, let alone best film. Rubbish film).Honestly think this had a shot at best picture at the academy awards. If not it should be 1917. Unfortunately for Adam Driver he is coming up against joker, so he won't be rewarded for his stunning performance",

            "content": "Marriage Story directed by Noah Baumbach is about a marriage between \"two good looking \" people involved actively in world of theater. Wife Nicole( talented Scarlett Johansson from Vicky Christina Barcelona) Husband Charlie (Adam Driver from my favorite movie BlacKkKlansman) have a son Henry (Azhy Robertson know him from the movie Juliet , naked)and have lived in NY for 10 years as husband and wife. And then Nicole and Henry move to Los Angeles to be with Nicole's mom and sister. The marriage already had problems and Nicole wants a divorce. The whole marriage situation and separation which turns into filing of a divorce is shown very well. The best part of movie is Divorce lawyer Nora Fanshaw ( played very well by Laura Dern) who has a great understanding of why Nicole should get a divorce , child custody and probably money too from her husband Charlie. Nora, beautiful and stylish, is confident, fearless and knows how to win. Her confidence makes Nicole feel meek. Nicole feels Nora is too aggressive. Love between Nicole and Charlie comes and goes . Anger and frustration about turn of their relationship drives Charlie towards anger and Nicole towards self pity. Nicole's need for her husband in every aspect of her life cannot be met by husband Charlie. The decisions they made about never involving lawyers goes into thin air when Nicole involves Nora as her lawyer. Screenplay is great. Laura Dern deserves an Oscar for portraying a lawyer who is compassionate towards the woman in a divorce and at the same time applauds the husband for his talents. Entire cast did a great job. It was truly a pleasure to watch Jay (Ray Liotta )as Charlie's lawyer. Jay is a street-smart lawyer and very competitive unlike Charlie's other lawyer, Bert, who is aging and feels sorry for Charlie( well acted by Alan Alda). Charlie's helplessness in divorce case is shown well by his change of lawyer from Jay to Bert and then back to Jay. Marriage from different angles definitely makes a great story. Oscar worthy acting.",

            "content": "Kinda totally hated this. Practically enraptured during the opening VO/montage. Well done there. Then... meh.Lots of very affected/stereotypical characters. A few practically sitcom scenes, which really didn't fit. Alan Alda was nice, but Julie Hagerty was all over the map, and Ray Liotta was like in an 80s gangster movie. This is not, so much, the acting, as the writing. Oddly over the top characters, for a film that feels a hell of a lot like it's trying to be the pain and torture of real life.More unreality: The biggest arguments Adam Driver and Scarlett Johansson have are Entirely Scripted. He says something. She responds. He counters that. Period after each sentence. Not a hint of talking over each other, or finger waggle plus mouth open to immediately want to retort but waiting to make sure you are heard. No one talks like this, and the courtroom scene did manage to get some overlapping dialog, so I know Baumbach can write and direct that. So why did he give up?I've been in family court. Too much. There's no reason any judge would have given them 10% of the time or leeway to discuss he did. And order to sit down then just wait for compliance for a minute? No. No judge on earth.And... the careers. Write what you know can be taken too far and Important Theater plus TV Career is not useful. It's so foreign to almost any viewer it's practically insulting. Especially when Adam Driver is begging poverty while flying cross-country regularly. Poor people do not fly places. He may not be able to pay top lawyer rates, but he's not poor.Generally, I didn't believe a thing Charlie was scripted to say. He bounced between devoted, resigned, and angry way too fast. And incompetent beyond belief. No one running a theater company could be so unaware of how much legal matters happen. He'd be dealing with legal documents all the time, likely have a lawyer between \"he knows\" and \"on retainer.\" Sure, an entertainment lawyer, but he could be referred to a family lawyer, and likely that guy would be at the bar during wrap parties and have brought it up, so he'd be adequately represented before this.Oh, and then let's talk Adam Driver. He has turned out to be a much better actor in this than I expected. But since he's so bad before this I pretty much avoid movies he's in, that's not saying much. Still a huge problem of emoting in... any way at all. Especially notable when he would suddenly get angry about something and rather turn quicky, or storm across a room to: deliver it with the same tone, and facial expression as his previously resigned or happy lines, maybe with a finger raised in anger. This is not a good actor, and I don't know why anyone gives him the time of day. It eludes me entirely.",

Their argument scene had me crying my eyes out. I'm tearing up now just thinking about it.I would have given this a 9/10 if it weren't for the ending that felt very painful. I would have liked the couple to get through their difficulties and get back together by the end, as it's clearly communicated how much they actually still love eachother and want the best for their family. This movie was so good, that it would have been awesome to end on a positive note, with a message of hope and a happy ending.I could have understood her choice to actually go ahead with the divorce if he was indeed abusive and repulsive, but he wasn't. Also the guy she ends up with at the end was bland and ugly looking, nothing like the dashing handsome charismatic Adam Driver. That for me was an extra bit of salt in the wound, that such a gorgeous and amazing woman as Scarlett would end up with a bland boring guy instead of the amazing guy that is Adam. But oh well, that's the sting in the tail of this movie, the heart-wrenching journey they go through and the bitter ending.Overall, a fantastic movie that really stuck with me, albeit one that I don't feel I can re-watch very easily, largely cause of the painful feelings it invokes, especially as how my own parents went through a similar kind of thing, and I grew up in this kind of scenario, as I'm sure is the case for a lot of people watching this movie.I'd put this into my Top 100 must-see movies. A really hard-hitting, stunningly acted, amazingly delivered Oscar-worthy gem. 8 or 9 out of 10, that would fall flat without Adam Driver and Scarlett Johannsen's jaw dropping acting.Noah Baumbach did an incredible job with the script and directing.

The story does an amazing job of balancing the characters perspectives. It's fun to watch as the father is firstly portrayed as the villain only for that thought to be flipped to view the mother as the villain. It creates a real sense of conflict. One scene in particular which you would know if you have seen the movie, reeeaallly hits hard, it is so excellently done and almost made me cry...almost. There is quite a lot of back and forth with lawyers which gets a bit repetitive but is still interesting enough to fully follow what is happening. The ending is also satisfying yet really quite annoying, it certainly doesn't end the way you would want it to but it also doesn't end badly. Gud 8/10.",

Driver and Johansson's actorish hamming of thin roles added to Laura Dern's absurd, vicious solicitor, who Johansson takes entirely seriously, is preposterous.It's a tribute to how ludicrous our current stock is of serious drama that Marriage Story is considered anything other than an obvious misfire. Compare it to Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf. Marriage Story is a college freshman's 'understanding' of a collapsing marriage entirely lacking the authentic, biting, black humor of Woolf and its intense dramatics. Naturally, and consistent with its misandry and easy theatrics and solutions, the husband in MS had an affair because of course he did. It makes the writing absurdly easy, if entirely disappointing.

Also, I would like to applaud the director and writer, Noah Baumbach. This is my first view of his work and I'm really impressed. Some people may say that the film gets boring because of the dialogue and stuff, but the content of it makes the story more realistic in my opinion. And don't get me started on the acting -- it was just pure raw emotion. I teared up tons of times. The movie overall portrays the proceedings of getting a divorce, it became very interesting as it showed more side of jurisdiction, specifically when it comes to child support. Both parties fighting for their rights and trying their best not to ruin their children's life.Overall, I'd give it a 8/10.PS: I'm new to writing a review.

            "content": "From the jarring first scene to the hopeful finale, \"Marriage Story\" is a simple, honest, yet entertaining film about life as it is--it's the kind of film we need more of.There's a lot that's done wonderfully about this movie, from the performances by the leads and the supporting cast (Laura Dern is an underappreciated star of the film), meaningful commentary on gender and relationships, and unromantic, realistic depictions of marriage and divorce. It is visually appealing and vintage feeling. It remains entertaining throughout despite the infinite mundanities of divorce law. It refuses to force the audience to pick a side in the divorce: both protagonists feel very realistic, complex, and the right mixture of good and bad. There is no winner or loser in the movie, no good and evil, just two people realizing they aren't right for each other.That, I think, is the most poignant and powerful element of this film. There is no absolute right or wrong in the divorce, no clear antagonist other than human stupidity. Films often depict an unhealthy view of relationships and love; one where two people sort out their issues and then there are never problems again, one where a lasting marriage is the ultimate goal of life, one where every ended relationship is a devastating tragedy. \"Marriage Story\" says just the opposite. It depicts Nicole and Charlie's divorce not as a failure, but simply as a new chapter in their lives. Though they are incredibly sad and broken up about their marriage ending, it is not the end of their lives. Nicole and Charlie don't just matter when they're a couple; they each have unique and immeasurable merit on their own. They're both beautiful and flawed human beings like anyone else. They have not failed by splitting up, they have simply become more themselves. In an age where many biases and norms of the past are unraveling, \"Marriage Story\" is the encouragement that we need that the \"truths\" we've been taught by norms of the past do not have to apply to us. What matters most is that our lives are happy and meaningful.For a film largely about divorce, \"Marriage Story\" is surprisingly sweet, funny, and optimistic, and ultimately very meaningful and impactful. One of my favorite films of the year to be sure, and one that I'll certainly return to in the future.",

Yes, I get it that some viewers are sobbing while watching it and insisting that it perfectly captures their own divorce, or the divorce of their parents. \"Marriage Story\" didn't do that for me. Alan Alda, as a nice guy divorce lawyer, Laura Dern, as a diabolically manipulative, slinky-dress and high-heeled-shoe wearing lawyer, and Ray Liotta as the ultimate shark divorce lawyer, were the best things about this movie. Their parts are written and performed with great skill and they satisfied me greatly.Adam Driver and Scarlett Johansson are fine, but their characters simply aren't written as compellingly as writer-director Noah Baumbach wanted them to be. Baumbach was shooting for a tear-jerker where the two characters were equally sympathetic and the divorce was a great, unavoidable tragedy.I was bored while watching this over-long movie. I didn't feel that a whole heck of a lot was at stake. The phrase \"First world problems\" kept going through my head. Charlie (Adam Driver) and Nicole (Scarlett Johansson) are both young, healthy, good looking, wealthy, blessed with many supportive friends, and enjoying great careers in show business. I saw no insurmountable obstacle that made the divorce inevitable. Two people committed to a marriage could have worked out Charlie and Nicole's problems. That they chose not to do so is their own choice and I can't be made to care more about their marriage than they do.Also, the divorce itself didn't strike me as such a big deal. So what if they get divorced? Why should I care? Both will be with another equally gorgeous, successful show business spouse in no time.The bulk of the movie: many long scenes where Charlie and Nicole tell each other or someone else what they like and don't like about each other, themselves, or their marriage. These scenes don't drive any plot and they didn't involve me or get me to care. \"Marriage Story\" opens with a scene of Charlie and Nicole reading lists of things they love about each other. Again, I was bored. I just did not care that Nicole cuts Charlie's hair well or that Charlie closes the cabinets Nicole neglects to close.For a long time I kept waiting for a scene that would make me care. I kept waiting for some insight, some plot development, that would make me gasp and not regret spending two hours listening to rich, lucky people whine about a problem that they created themselves. That scene never came. One line made me nod: Charlie tells Nicole that she doesn't want her own voice; rather, she wants to whine about not having her own voice.Some masterful plots throw two antagonists up against each other and cause me to debate within myself which antagonist I sympathize with. \"Marriage Story\" did not perform that legerdemain for me. The script is weighted in Charlie's favor. Nicole is not giving saving the marriage her all. Charlie is more invested. A woman who quits so easily on a commitment to a desirable man who is the father of her young son, a son who clearly loves his father, is not compelling to me.",

The acting, the directing, the music, they were all wonderful and I was especially blown away by Scarlett's performance. I've never seen her in this type of movie before and she really did a fantastic job. It was refreshing to see a divorce story that didn't focus on bitterness and anger, but on the love that still remained.",

Scarlett is so great in this film her character has so many layers she is funny and sad. This is by far her best performance ever. Adam Driver is equally great playing a lot of restraint and then blasts of emotion. This film has great dialogue, funny characters and a very heart warming story.

I feel that Noah Baumbach did not get the best out of the actors, who are capable of more. The plot was extremely slow in many parts and the movie could have been 30 minutes shorter, without losing any value.I'm basically agreeing with one of the previous reviews that the acting was great, was the writing was mediocre when it could have been amazing.

This film can an will relate to everyone I gaurnate you, the ups and downs marriages an relationships go through and even in heartbreak through their demise and breakup. How two people can look back at a pure beauty which was an still smile.You can fall out of love with someone but you never stop truly loving them of caring, if you goin threw a difficult time in life, if that's a breakup of devorce or for anythin for that matter, just stay strong and everything will be okay.Don't be sad cause it's over, smile cause it happened.",

The humanity, sensitivity and candor in Adam Driver and Scarlett Johansson's performances coupled with an exemplary script provides for a grounded film unfolding with endless layers of depth that mine the audience of emotional catharsis.The simple title: Marriage Story aptly encapsulates the film. It's not a divorce story, It's about a marriage of dichotomies and dualisms. NY vs LA, stage vs screen, work vs play, family vs friends, actor vs director, performance vs authenticity. It may be hard to comprehend that throughout the film as we witness Charlie and Nicole fall apart but its in the final sequence that Baumbach really reconciles the dichotomies. He tenderly reveals to the audience that it was not his intent to show how different each side of the dualisms, but to shine a light on the overlap, the grey areas, the messiness of trying to draw lines in the sand.",

When watching this film, it's almost like your feeling the pain of both spouses, what they're both going through, how they feel, and they're real humans. None of this could've been done without a great screenplay and acting. Baumbach's storytelling and directing carries a good chunk of the film, bringing the pacing and tone together. One thing that is phenomenal about this film is the opening, where Charlie and Nicole are describing each other in these long, expressive monologues; that alone is easily one of the best scenes of film in 2019. Both Scarlett Johansson and Adam Driver give real performances; showing off the simple extent that an actor can take while acting yet pulling so much of the intellectual and emotional force. However, the musical score is a little obnoxious and doesn't fit the tone and Laura Dern's performance, while well acted, is kind of overhyped for what it is.

Actress who, in a period of burnout, leaves her L.A. life and moves to New York where she meets, works with, and eventually marries Charlie.Narration starts the story, where the two characters describe all that they love about each other while we see examples of those words depicted on screen. We then come to find that these \"narrations\" are actually the written words each has been asked to write about each other as they begin the process of divorce. A beautifully well crafted and concise way of introducing the characters, establishing their love for each other, and why they married without delaying the main focus of the story... the pains of divorce.Charlie and Nicole wish to end things as peacefully as possible. However, self-interest (or perhaps a bit of self-preservation) for the lives each wish to live beyond marriage interfere with those goals. The process of divorce, particularly when custody of a child is involved, picks at the wounds that led to the divorce, making it easier to forget what people may have once loved about each other.Most divorces are a result of paths going in different directions, realizations of things that you may not have seen during the infancy of a relationship. Careers, ambition, feelings of self-worth... they all come into play and are depicted as fuel for the gradual demise of their relationship.Now, enter the many vultures that surround these two looking to divorce. Divorce attorneys that you almost feel have developed their approaches or styles, perhaps based on some bad divorce they, themselves, had gone through. They do not always seem to have their client's best interests in mind. Their aim to score the win for their client simply fans the fires of pain that may already be encircling the soon to be ex-couple.Without going further into plot, the biggest success of this film is how each character is a sympathetic character but at the same time, guilty of sins that may have led to current events, signifying there is no ALL Good or ALL bad... no main villain.. but simply two people whose paths intersected at one point, met each other's needs for a time, then ultimately drifted in different directions.At the center of all of this is their son, who clearly loves both mother and father, who has some connection issues due to distances between father and son, both geographically and emotionally. But through it all, the son serves as catalyst for the rising contentiousness of the interaction between mother and father as they fight for custody.All told, the story progresses to a moment that showcases some of the best acting I've seen from BOTH actors to date.I would love to comment on the ending but I hesitate, not because of spoilers, but because I almost feel that the uncertainty of how it ends is part of what gives the ending a satisfying feeling.Not since Kramer vs Kramer has a film about divorce given such a painfully earnest look at divorce. Fair, yet honest, and, at times, emotionally gut wrenching look into divorce. This movie is a must see.",

Maybe some of those people went through a divorce themselves or were kids who's parents split up. While I am part of the second group, let me tell you why this movie emotionally didn't touch me at all, but why it's also still a good movie!Hands down.... this movie has one of the best opening scenes I have ever seen and I kind of expected something like this after watching the trailer. It drags you in right from the start and you know you are in for 135min of a difficult character piece. I need to say it right from the get go... Adam Driver and Scarlett Johansson are fantastic in it. The way they feed of each other, in this broken dynamic of a couple that went from love to hate, is mesmerising and you completely forget that they are acting, you feel like the invisible child that is witnessing its parents fight and you want to stop them fighting, but you can't.Giving the audience that feeling is by no means accidental I think. The great camera work deserves a big shout out here! I think there are clearly 2 ways to look at that movie, the female and the male side. As I'm male myself, maybe I auto side with the husband in this scenario (I hope not) but I haven't seen Scarlett Johansson in a role that I hated her more in. Sure, the behaviour of the husband wasn't perfect either, but while the audience is lead to believe that the husband is the victim, this role can shift over (at a later point) to the wife becoming the \"victim\" and no one thinks about that the real victim here is the child who's stuck in the middle of all of this.This movie is no joy ride and I tend to say that it should have been 30min shorter. Especially the musical scenes in the end felt like \"to much\". Sure, I get it, it's a reference to the Broadway theme, but it just felt out of place. Maybe this movie is a bit to long by design, to make you feel the dread and despair as a divorce, especially when it gets so dirty, is a process that goes on for much longer than you think it should.I give it a 7.4/10 where the acting is clearly the highlight of the movie and I wouldn't be surprised if Driver and/or Johansson would be rewarded for their performances!",

I watched the film due to it's overwhelming good reviews, and I often like Adam Driver's work.This film was not for me. With all the Oscar buzz for the actors, the characters didn't seem real, relatable, or sympathetic to me; they seemed to be unlikeable stereotypes or caricatures, and the acting came across to me as acting. I wasn't rooting for anyone, but rather felt annoyed with them.Yes, our legal system is largely a corrupt, money-making sham with unscrupulous lawyers working the system and financially taking advantage of their vulnerable clients. Seeing the dark mockery of this horrible system in this film didn't teach me anything, make me feel good, or entertain me, but did leave me wishing for my time back.This felt like a failed attempt to emulate the tone of a Woody Allen film. I thought Alan Alda hit those notes the best; his short time onscreen was the best part of the film for me. There were also some funny lines of dialogue.I could not help but contrast this film to Kramer Vs. Kramer, a well made movie in a similar genre with sympathetic performances, well developed characters, and plenty of people to root for.",

And then he cuts himself because clearly there wasn't enough drama so they tried to come up with just anything at all - the most random unrelated stuff - literally just absolutely anything at all that could possible add an ounce of drama to this movie because otherwise they knew people would just fall asleep in their seats. I mean... so pointless, and boring, and horrible. The acting of course is great but it just can't make up for the poor writing. I don't understand who greenlights those projects?? Who thought that this would be a good movie?! They surely must have known it would be bad after reading the script. I don't think anyone even read the script. They just heard that some big names were attached and that's all they cared about. Seriously... and on top of it - this was nominated for best picture? I mean... wow. Just wow. NOT OK!!!",

We could see it sip through in his earlier works; the humanism, the humour and the great eye for details. Both in the form of cunningly interspersed metaphors and everyday things. While the dialogue is excellent, the visual language communicated is just as subtle and balanced.\nWe follow a couple and their son. Her an actress, him a theatrical director, during the excruciating escalations of their divorce. Seemingly without them anticipating any of it. A plot like this could easily be bland and repetitive without the writing and directing from someone like Baumbach.\nWhen it comes to acting, this kind of movie needs experienced and highly talented participants. Scarlett Johansson, Adam Driver and the whole cast deliver just that. And more!\nThis is one of those movies where both cast and crew exceed themselves and thakes their art and career to a whole new level.\nAll this to the beatiful and fitting musical score by Randy Newman.\nWithout doubt the movie of the year!",

However, whereas the focus is on the Dad in Kramer, Marriage story is more about the couple's relationship unwinding in spite of the fact that they still care very much about each other. Another common complaint labels this story as \"self indulgent\". I do not understand this complaint. Many of the most famous writers, including Hemingway, Graham Greene, and Joseph Conrad (for example) poured very personal experience into their works. I suspect that Noah Baumbach put his own soul into Marriage Story. This story is personal and gritty. If you don't cry, you're one of the lucky folks who has never had to say goodbye to a lover.",

            "content": "Noah Baumbach's incisive and compassionate look at a marriage breaking up and a family staying together. (Written by Netflix)Marriage Story is one of the best if not the best films that talk about two couples who get separated/divorced. Everything about is real and genuine especially the dialogues. It also has very few comedy in it so the film doesn't seem dull/boring which gave the film a special taste.Firstly, in my opinion, this is Scarlett Johansson's best performance so far. She succeeded in giving us that great character of the wife Nicole. She gave us one of the best long take scenes of the film, especially that the film has many of these scenes. But, this one specifically was the best because it was focused on her and just her, it felt so real/genuine with her beautiful acting. Adam Driver also gave us one of the best performances of his career for sure. anytime when he was crying or shouting, it all felt so real. In any scene where the two actors were together, it felt like a boom because both of their performances were better than the other, and the famous scene where the two were having an argument, proves it.Secondly, Noah Baumbach is such an amazing director and screenwriter. When you watch a Noah Baumbach film, it will be obvious because his scripts are written in a way that would make any scene or dialogue seem so real/genuine. His way of directing too is so unique and amazing especially in this film, the cinematography and the transitions were so smooth and well done. This film's dialogues really reminded me of Frances Ha (2012) that was directed by him and written by him & his partner Greta Grewing who is also an amazing screenwriter, and we saw how amazing she is in Lady Bird (2017) and Little Women (2019) that were both directed by her. Noah Baumbach & Greta Grewing are some of the best directors & screenwriters.One thing I didn't like about the film is that I felt like sometimes the story of one side only wasn't being told as much as the other side which seemed unfair and we didn't get to know what this person thinks or what their opinion is as much as we did with the other side. Also, I felt like I needed to know more about their backstory or about other situations that would explain to the audience more about their relationship/love. But, all reasons for the two getting divorced were very reasonable and presented in a way that people nowadays would relate to which made the film unique, related, and so real with all of its dialogues & scenes.A beautiful film that's filled with great acting performances, directing, cinematography, and a little bit of comedy to cool down the energy of the film.My rating is 9/10",

            "content": "I debated whether or not to even write anything about Marriage Story. It has touched so many people, and I don't want to come at this disrespectfully, because, in my life, I have not experienced divorce. My wife and I have been married happily for 20 years. My parents are about to celebrate their 50th wedding anniversary. And both my maternal and paternal grandparents were married for nearly 70 years and nearly 50 years respectively. So I guess I feel like I'm trespassing here. But I love movies. And I loved this one. And there are many things that are done well in this film. so here I go. First I should say that I have not been a huge fan of Noah Baumbach in the past. It is not like I have anything against directors who concentrate on smaller stories that seem as if they are actually pulled from the pages of real life. In fact, I love independent cinema when it is done well. Alexander Payne, Kenneth Lonergan, and Wes Anderson (although Anderson's films are more surreal sometimes) are some of my favorite directors. Again I think this movie is done well. The screenplay is very good. The acting is phenomenal, worthy of the award nominations I am sure are going to come to fruition. And the direction always seems sure of itself (save for a few scenes that go on longer than they should). But it's more than that. However, before I expand on that let me address some of the things that may make people a little hesitant about seeing Story. It's depressing. There is no getting around that. in fact, there is a point in Story where the depressing part of the film becomes so overwhelming, that it actually begins to almost physically hurt. it's predictable and it knows it. Almost from frame one, everyone who I saw it with knew exactly where it was going. And like in real life, there is no real silver lining. But it's not hopeless. And here is why, if people are hesitant to see this movie, they should ignore those feelings of hesitation. The son. As far as hope is concerned, the son in this film is the most hopeful part of the this couple's existence. He is the glue that keeps the lives of the characters together, even when divorce rips them apart. And as far as it being depressing...well...that's life . But I can say that every depressing experience that I have ever been a part of, and although divorce has not affected me, I have still had my fair share depressing moments, there's always a ray of hope somewhere. The lives of these people have that ray of hope as well. And because of that, there is a feeling that they, in the long run, will be alright. Another reason to see this movie has to do with the supporting characters. From the attorneys, to the extended families, almost everyone has someone who lifts them up when everything comes crashing down. One of my favorite songs is called \"Held,\" by Natalie Grant. In it, there is a line that I love. Grant clearly means it in a religious sense, but almost anyone can relate to it. It says,This is what it means to be held,\nhow it feels when the sacred is torn from your life\nand you survive.\nThis is what it is to be loved\nand to know that the promise was\nwhen everything fell we'd be heldEveryone has someone who, when life comes crashing down, will hold them. When Story was over, l felt like that would be true for the two main characters in the story. No matter what...no matter where they end up, they will always have the people in their lives to count on. And I think that even includes each other.",

It is about people, very real people, who do fail to be certain people but the process of failing just makes them so relatable and lovable. Nicole and Charlie are getting a divorce, and you think there will be a good guy and a bad one. But they are both vulnerable and by the end of the day want to do the right thing, and not only the thing that brings them satisfaction. It is not a fist fight but a storm of emotions, emerging waves of the past and rocky mountains of the future.\nThe acting is very very well executed, here and there a bit too many tears - but as it is about a divorce totally realistic. So is the representation of the ongoing divorce. The music is lovely, I especially loved the ending having musical elements.\nThere are quite a few inserts of funny elements that takes away from the movie's dramatic tone: like when Charlie cuts himself with that tiny knife, I actually laughed, or when Nora is talking about Jesus and his absent father.\nWe can all relate to these characters, and parenthood is represented so vividly.\nOn the technical side it was neatly executed, as well, editing etc.\nI couldn't help but seeing a lot of Woody Allen in this movie, mostly because of its wittiness and pace, and the music.Definitely a watch.

This is a subject that many other movies had explored in the past, but this one has the more patient and humanist look at it. We see this couple, after several years of marriage, struggling to move on together. Some viewers can be somewhat bored because they know already how divorce works, but this is not the goal of Marriage Story.Noah Baumbach, with its script and directing, dissects this divorce, including how are the character's feelings and thoughts about this unfortunate situation. That dissection is helped by an incredible duo of performances; Adam Driver and especially Johansson which is easily, her best performance ever. The rest of the cast brings some energy and comedy on a sad tone story. Baumbach's camera shows the confrontation of a family being separated, yet wanting to be together again, which leads to some very emotional scenes. But we can complain a bit about the original score by Randy Newman; his music is well composed, but some sequences that already impactful are a bit over-dramatized.At the end, Marriage Story is a heartbreaking film that'll shines this award season thanks to the wonderful cast, skillful directing and script, and proving that Netflix, again this year, isn't playing around with the audience.Marriage Story's rating: 8.0/10",

Also for me personally for a movie tackling such heavy subjects the humor in it, sometimes just doesn't fit.But like I said before the two main acting parts really make this movie worth a watch even if you're familiar with this kind of story.

            "content": "Marriage Story was definitely the best movie I've watched over the past year. I've never got married, had a kid, or divorced. But after watching this movie, it makes me feel like I have gone through the entire struggling, painful process. There are no dramas throughout the movie, rather, all the stories sounds real, normal and could happen to any married couple that are trying to get divorced. Time is always cruel and powerful: It can set apart a couple, who used to love each other deeply and exclusively, and now make them fight against each other, (with the help of each's lawyer) , for money, assets and custody of children. All these changes don't take too long - just in few years. In the movie, Charlie (the husband) and Nicole ( the wife) had a very intensive fight for over 15 minutes, I was impressed by how angry, unsatisfied, nagging they were. Those negative emotion, that had been suppressed and controlled for years had finally exploded and became devastating. They used the most harsh words to hurt each other. The husband even said he wanted the wife to die. Not surprisingly, they finally divorced. But I was very sad about the ending of the story. They could have had a happy family, watching their kid grow up together, but they terminated it because of disputes on chores and small things in lives. Had they communicated their negative emotion timely and thoroughly whenever the issue arose, and weren't leave it accumulated, a divorce can be avoided. But it was too late to say this. Nicole had already started her new life in LA with her boyfriend. A divorce was already a divorce, nothing can get back. What I've learned is: life won't give you a chance to regret, and move backward. A broken heart will never be healed completely. You have to move on to embrace your new life, And let the past be an unforgettable memory. I highly recommend this movie, because it gives you a good chance to rethink about marriage, life and divorce.",

Also Laura Dern's character was totally unprofessional in her snuggling with a prospective client. The opposing shark was more realistic but highly exaggerated.Finally there is law which sets which state has jurisdiction over the issue of child custody. It would have been New York. But that was ignored. The California lawyer would have advised Charlie to file a divorce in New York. But then there would not have been a movie.",

The story of the separation, then the divorce, the lawyers, the fight, the observer - is tragic for a lot of reasons.First it shows us the cruel world of legal fights, where everything can be used against you in ways you couldn't have anticipated. It is difficult to perceive being a lawyer as something noble, the legal system as something that is supposed to deliver justice and to even get married as something that is worth doing if there is even a slightest chance of getting a divorce in the end.Then it shows you how lack of money puts you at an incredible disadvantage (which is the case for most aspects of life anyway) and how easily someone can crumble because of it.It shows you that everything is up for interpretation (e.g. punch in the wall) when there is no context. And even if there is context, people will still misunderstand you (e.g. the knife scene).It shows you that two people who love each other can metaphorically hold knives against each other under enough pressure. And then it leaves you thinking...What if?\nWhat if she read the letter?And you realize that it would not matter anyway, because too much damage has already been done. Which could be okay, if after the whole drama they find happiness again. But then you realize that humans can be so stupid sometimes. You realize that humans are unpredictable, scary, scared - and they never really know what they need. Because they are \"figuring things out\".This isn't to say that being human is bad or anything - it's just that being alive is not easy and sometimes being alive is not great. But in the end we are alive and we make the most of what we are, what we choose and what we get.",

            "content": "The thread of a Wedding Story seems to be divorce, but what director Noah Baumbach reveals is a glimpse of real-life in a relationship between two people. That thing you never talk about, regarding opposite and undesirable affections that arise, and what you see are two people who genuinely love each other by taking unthinkable and disloyal attitudes to each other.At the beginning of the movie, it's possible to know the strengths of the two protagonists. They write a description that each made about the other at the request of a mediator. We found out that Nicole (Scarlett Johansson) is a loving mother, great listener, concerned about her mother and sister, and never closes the cabinet. Charlie (Adam Driver), on the other hand, is a talented and creative theater director, extraordinarily competitive and devours his meals.Entering the intimacy of the couple, who has gone through previous crises, makes life difficult for the viewer accustomed to taking sides. Logically, some dirt on the couple is dug up. Charlie has already cheated on Nicole once and rarely takes her personal needs into account. Nicole goes to LA to film the pilot of a TV series and kind of kidnaps the couple's son to live there permanently, the fact that Charlie only learns of when he is surprised by the divorce papers.The performances reinforce this documentary idea: both Adam Driver and Scarlett Johansson are convincing in their performances. Each receives a monologue from the director: Charlie at the bar and Nicole with the horrible Nora Fanshaw (Laura Dern, fantastic!). Also, there is a dialogue, or rather, an unthinkable argument, that famous final round in which one says what is not to be told and what is frightened is heard.Rarely does the film sounds conventional or excessive, as in musical numbers, which perhaps worked better in the theater. But in general, it is a beautiful movie, a work of fiction that manages to scratch real life and makes us feel that the couple should be together, even though we know it would not work. Or it rather would.",

He hadn't seen it either, but heard it was getting much acclaim and it looked really real based on the trailers. Given my love for movies or shows that potray reality or don't have happy endings (one of my favorite movies to this day is still Requiem for a Dream and BoJack quickly became one of my all time favorite shows), I decided to watch this without viewing any trailers or reading any reviews.Within the first 20 mins I felt bored. I kept going to give it a fair shot to see, maybe it gets better. Nope. The only part i enjoyed was watching the lawyers, which was also, in my opinion, some of the only good acting on screen.The whole movie seems incredibly forced. There are SO many useless scenes that go literally no where. Like that scene with the woman observing Charlie and Henry? Not only was it, boring and awkward, it was completely pointless and didn't advance the story at all.I also hated Nicole. At first, I wasn't a fan of Charlie either, but by the time they reached the fight scene and you find out he only cheated when they were somewhat separated, I was 100% on Charlie's side. She's selfish, manipulative, a liar and puts Charlie through hell after making believe she didn't want it to be complicated to begin with. And then at the end, she thinks it's unfair that he gets 45% custody?! WHAT?! I was so annoyed by that.Then, the movie ends abruptly. It's just a terrible ending leaving so many open ends! I thought \"what? That's it? That's how it ends?\" when i saw the credits come on.I say don't waste your time. I have no idea why this has such a high rating or how it can make anyone cry. I cried when Frankenwienie died (Everytime lol) but this, this is an empty shell of a movie attempting to be deeper than it actually is.The ONLY part that made me feel bad at all was when Charlie takes Henry trick or treating after Nicole.

Both Scarlett and Adam have singing bits at the end that drug this movie out even longer than need be, I had to fast forward. And don't get me started on their kid, who seemed to be on the spectrum, and was annoying AF. Bottom line, absolutely nothing happens in this movie. If you have insomnia maybe it will help lull you to sleep.",

Throughout the film he is able to invoke whatever emotion he is portraying in the watcher and it is almost as if we are watching his real life play out on the screen. Scarlett Johansson is also very impressive in her role and especially in scenes that are focused on her. However, the reason for this not being a 10 is purely due to Driver out-acting Johansson in many scenes in my opinion and it tells in the way she tries to up the ante herself leaving her exposed in the role. Overall, this is a sensational film and should be watched by everyone!",

            "content": "Netflix's Marriage Story, written and directed by Noah Baumback (The Meyerowitz Stories) and starring Scarlett Johansson as Nicole and Adam Driver as Charlie, tells the story of the divorce of two young artists at the beginning of their careers. She is a young actress known for a topless scene in her last movie (this is according to the people in this movie) and he is an avant garde theater director and head of his own company in New York City. When they meet by chance, they fall in love and she moves to NYC where she becomes the 'draw' for his theater company. Eventually, they have a son. At the beginning of the movie, they are getting a divorce after 10 years and are seeing a mediator in the hope of having a friendly divorce.Is it a spoiler to tell you that a friendly divorce is rarer than a vegetarian meal at Mar-a-Lago? I knew a couple who mediated their divorce and everything was going well until they got to the jazz album collection (this was back in the day) which they were to split evenly. He objected - she didn't know Dizzy Gillespie from Dizzy Dean when I met her. She countered - yes, he introduced me to jazz but I was the one who actually bought and cared for our collection of over a 1000 albums - if it were up to him, he'd still be using his albums as coasters at the drunken parties he and his friends threw every week. And so much for mediation.The upshot of Marriage Story is that good people get divorced and often do terrible things, things they'd never dream of doing except for the divorce. And that's what happens to Nicole and Charlie. The contested divorce legal process is unfair and incredibly expensive. Laura Dern is Nicole's lawyer and she explains to Nicole that she cannot admit to any wrong-doing or even any flaws since our world treats women/wives/mothers so differently than men/husbands/fathers. Women/wives/mothers must be like Mary, mother of Christ and a virgin to boot. Men are like Joseph - who is absent when the going gets tough and isn't even the actual father who is away somewhere doing whatever it is that gods do.The other side is represented by Ray Liotta who tells Charlie that he had better get ready to be demonized and pay legal bills and costs that would make a lottery winner cringe. At first, Charlie is represented by a nice lawyer played by Alan Alda who tells him, \"We have to prepare to go to court hoping we don't go to court.\" When Charlie sees that Dern is crushing Alda at a meeting, he switches to Liotta who can talk faster and be meaner than anybody else.Along the way, there's a custody dispute. At the very beginning of the divorce, Nicole goes to LA to do a TV pilot (her first acting job outside her husband's company in a decade) and takes their son with her. The expectation is that she will return to NYC when the pilot is completed but then - she doesn't. Her family is in LA where she grew up and made a career as an actress. The money is exponentially better than doing theatre work. So, Charlie can only see his son by traveling cross country on weekends. As is usual in divorces where there are children, the child becomes the center of the divorce with each side claiming that it knows best for the child. Of course, the divorce is devastating to children, but that is a different movie and Baumbach concentrates on the adults.It gets complicated quickly. The heart of the story is told in long takes where both Johansson and Driver communicate their rage at what is happening to them and the man/woman they loved. These longs takes show both Johansson and Driver's acting chops - each of them is able to build a scene to the point where real emotions are on display. The hateful argument they have at the end of the divorce process is contrasted with the tender affection for both their partner's qualities and deficiencies that they talk about at the beginning of the process. In fact, it is probably true to say that if you can find a person who loves not only your wit and charm, but your surliness and bad habits, then you should chase him/her until you catch him/her because that is the person who loves you.Two songs from Sondheim's Company are sung - \"You Could Drive a Person Crazy\" by Nicole and her actress mother and actress sister, played beautifully by the under-appreciated Julie Haggerty and Merritt Wever, and \"Being Alive\" from the same musical sung by Driver. Each song speaks to what their characters are feeling about each other. Strangely, in Company, there is even a more appropriate song they could have sung - The Little Things You Do Together:\nIt's the little things you share together,\nSwear together,\nWear together,\nThat make perfect relationships.\nThe concerts you enjoy together,\nNeighbors you annoy together,\nChildren you destroy together,\nThat keep marriage intact.It's not talk of God and the decade ahead that\nAllows you to get through the worst.\nIt's \"I do\" and \"you don't\" and \"nobody said that\"\nAnd \"who brought the subject up first?\"\nIt's the little things,\nThe little things, the little things, the little things.There is so much to recommend this movie that I hesitate to mention a few missteps. While money is mentioned, often, it isn't really talked about in substance. The fact is that many people never recover, financially, from a divorce. This is partially solved in the movie by a gift from the gods that drops in their lap during the divorce. A bigger problem is that Baumbach wants it both ways - the great angry scenes where people say things to each other that they don't mean, but once said can never be unsaid, and the happy ending. One of the best angry arguments that Nicole and Charlie have is negated by their embrace at its end. The fact is that arguments drive people further apart and don't end in an embrace but, usually, a slammed door. There are some maudlin scenes whose purpose is to show that they have moved on with their lives and are doing fine, and still think of each other with love and affection. And a divorce that ends that way is rarer than a 2-for-1 meal at Mar-a-Lago.",

Scarlett Johansson and Adam Driver put all their effort into the roles of a separated husband and wife in a tense battle over their son. The movie's slow pace allows enough time to let the characters develop, and these are complex characters.It might not be the greatest movie of all time, but it's an effective one, and I recommend it.

All right, all right, let me explain.Marriage story simply deals with the split of this couple that had very happy years, but now they don't feel as connected as before. The thing with Noah Baumbach is he really likes to tell human stories, stories about an everyday problem that is not necessarily dealt with realistic encounters and dialogues(in a way they perfectly do, but they also thrive from being on a screen and develop their own world), but the general realism of a story like this gets translated through the script and camera. Does that make sense? Does it have a ground? Seriously, i'm sincere right now, i just lack the words, but i hope you get me.Anyway, this realism really connects with the watchers, you kind of feel inside the story, it' a \"well, that could've happened or could happen to me\". Of course you draw your mentality from there and you feel you could handled that situation better than the characters, but it's not about that, you don't know it because the emotions of this characters are real, palpable, almost like if events and reactions like that really happened and were simply recorded like a documentary, but highlighted. We're very very different, we don't all express our feelings the same way, that's why it differs from each individual. What i'm trying to say is that it's a relatable story, but still made for entertainment and i love that.Going more technical, Driver and Johansson are MAGNIFICENT, at the prime of their talent. Writing, direction and production overall, it's all up there and if i didn't make myself clear, it's a top notch work, the really embodied the spirit of this story. Oscar worthy? Hell yes, everything about this movie is good, i honestly can't see anything wrong with it, at first i was afraid of some forced dramatic acting, but, well maybe there is, but it definitely doesn't take anything out of the story and overall quality.In so many categories this movie excels, can't just pick one.

            "content": "Ok, so why would a film about a couple going through a divorce make for interesting viewing?Nicole is an actress and Charlie is a theatre director. The film starts with Nicole (Scarlett Johansson) and Charlie (Adam Driver) reflecting on each other's good qualities. We then realize they are actually in the process of splitting up, but nevertheless seem to be friends. Off course, this is before things start going wrong between them...or should that be worsen between them?Oh, whatever, this film did nothing for my senses from the very beginning. 'Marriage Story' is a dialogue driven movie. I mean, DIALOGUE! Wow, there's a lot of dialogue here...with not much else happening in the process except for a couple constantly disagreeing about everything. I like it when something actually HAPPENS in a movie...apart from conversation, that is.Due to the film's somber mood, all attempts at throwing in a bit of humour failed. If watching a couple going through a divorce is your thing (or if you are in the midst of a divorce settlement), then maybe you can relate and this is your type of movie. As for me, however, I found this snooze-fest incredibly boring, way too much talk, and ultimately not a very pleasant watch. These type of movies bore me to death. To add to this, it has a runtime of 137 minutes!!! Yawn!The performances were very natural, but alas, it couldn't save the movie for me. This might be a highly acclaimed multi-award winning movie, but I was not entertained...",

It's been just over 6 years since my separation/divorce from my former partner of 17 years and this film was about as enjoyable as actually going through a divorce. It admirably hits mostly all the right notes but that doesn't make it any more enjoyable. ScarJo is an engaging actress but lacks a centre that would suggest something soulful beyond that; this could be intentional on Baumbach's part. She is eventually out performed by Driver, though predictably, the film is weighted in favour of his character. The supporting players are fine with interesting contributions from Merrit Wever and Julie Hagerty as ScarJo's family; the spectrum of divorce lawyers is nicely covered from Alan Alda to Ray Liotta and Laura Dern, who may be in danger of becoming too much of a good thing or, at least, the same thing. (It will be interesting to see if her Marmee in the upcoming Little Women is an original creation or just another cross between Amy Jellico and Renata from BBL.)Mostly this reminds me of Michael Haneke's Amour, a film I described as \"Disneyland for people who've never dealt with end of life issues.\" Similarly, if you've ever been through a divorce, there's nothing in Marriage Story that makes the viewing of it at all edifying.",

            "content": "Review: Marriage Story (2019)\nMarriage Story is a heartfelt and unique portrayal of modern day divorce, encompassing all aspects of a gruelling and often one-sided experience. Noah Baumbach succeeds once again in achieving beauty in every aspect of his film, from its stunning Los Angeles setting to its impressive cast. Adam Driver plays Charlie, a highly successful stage director hoping to move back to New York, while Scarlett Johansson plays his wife, Nicole, an actress whose career grew as a result of her husband's fame, but who realises that her marriage has stripped her of independent identity. The couple struggles between their undying love for each other and their increasingly different life goals, which would lead them to opposite sides of the country, making spilt custody of their eight-year-old son impossible. Marriage Story is filled with highly emotional scenes, in particular a heated argument between Nicole and Charlie, during which they both say the most hurtful things possible to each other before breaking down in tears of guilt. Also moving is Adam Driver's singing scene, as his suffering is clear is clear in every note and facial expression. The film's soundtrack has been nominated for Best Original Score at the Golden Globes, and although not too impressive on its own, it fits the cinematography perfectly, especially in the beautifully timed opening sequence. What I like most about this film is that it presents a more uncommon type of divorce, where it is not a lack of love but a lack of compatibility in lifestyle that tears the two apart, making the process all the more painful and uncomfortable to watch. While it's doubtful that Marriage Story will come out on top at the Golden Globes or Oscars, it is certainly an important film that will stick in many viewers' minds for its beauty and complex portrayal of divorce and love.",

            "content": "I read once that to write a character in a screenplay you should prepare as much as possible about this character's aspects starting from their childhood, their school and what it has been like, their parents and how they were raised, their neighborhood and how was life in it, their friends and old toys, their first kiss and love story, their ambitions and passions and how they came to be. These can easily fill 20 pages of details that are not represented directly into the screenplay but they shape the truthfulness of the character, the details that make them alive and dynamic.In Marriage Story, i cant imagine nothing short of a book worth of details that humanized every little moment in this picture. Its truly dazzling the amount of work that went through this mesmerizing screenplay. Each word, statement, monologue, dialogue, decision, facial feature, had been studied extremely thoroughly resulting into a novel of dynamics. It feels very palpable and relatable up to a point of making it into a very personal level of even people who didn't go through a separation with this level of complexity.This articulate writing style had translated into elevating the performances into the level of true, its not acting, its simply true on every level. And to solidify this excellence, Noah Baumbach (director and writer) has passionately constructed each scene with the utmost of care; each frame is perfectly designed in angles, colors, dimensions, and production design to amplify the emotional rollercoasters of the story. And lastly, the editing style specifically the choice of when to break a scene and when to prolong it and make more focused, are just in the level of master class.Marriage story is many things, its an important human story, a screenplay to remember and dissect and study to all those who are interested in any form of writing, and simply a movie that would easily grab your attention from its very first minute into the level of you welcoming its soul punching arc, because it is very real, something that is in somewhat of a shortage in our lives nowadays.",

This film was on my list of \"films to watch in the future\" for a long time (probably more than a year ago), and today I say with total tranquility that I regret not having watched this film before. Marriage Story shows us The story of a wedding (ah go), or rather, the decay of a wedding. While Nicole suffers from leaving her dreams aside to be next to her husband in plays, and feels increasingly lost in relation to her choices and even her personality. Charlie worries too much about his work and himself, which makes him withdraw from his family. A very important point in the whole film is Henry, son of the couple. Which in a way is the motivator of the whole dispute within this divorce. The boy plays a crucial role within the film, especially in the scenes with Charlie. The film manages, in a very crude but sensitive way, to demonstrate the decadence of Nicole and Charlie's relationship. But it also shows how they know and care for each other (especially Nicolle in relation to Charlie). This film brings many important messages to everyone, and I feel that this film fits into the group of films that are needed to be watched by everyone.",

There are very some long takes skillfully played by Johansson and Driver, whose acting keeps the movie afloat. Unfortunately, most of the cast is appalling and overacting (Nora, kid, Grandma, Sister, theater crew). These may just well poor scripting. The movie cannot decide whether it wants to be a comedy (Annie Hall) or a drama, as it throws in some cringy slapstick comedy jokes. Also, the movie fails to take sides. It strives to make both main characters likeable whereas the script clearly turns Johansson into a despicable person from the get go. Furthermore, the characters don't follow an arc, and the movie becomes predictable.\nOverall, I wouldn't watch it again. I would recommend a viewing to most people, especially those wanting to go through a divorce so that they hopefully will behave more humanely to one another.",

What Marriage Story did is show me the strife and pain that can happen during a divorce from the position of those going through it. It's not stylized or romanticized like a lot of TV shows and movies can portray. It shows you the raw and unfiltered feeling that can explode amidst anger and fear and change. It drags you in on both sides so you truly can't say \"Well, Nicole is right\" or \"Charlie is right\". This, to me, feels like the truest-to-life portrayal of a divorce.",

Charlie and Nicole start the story by writing about each other, the things they love about each other when they are in one of the therapist sessions. Nicole declines to share her writings and Charlie was keen on sharing his but Nicole was no longer interested in Charlie or his thoughts. What sounds like a perfect marriage, slowly shows us how the two ends up destroying each other in ways they never thought they could.\nCharlie has always been dependent on his work, his life revolved around his theatre. His choices were based on what he thought would be best, Nicole never had a say and it was getting to a point where she felt she was nothing but worthless as an individual. The writer and the director of the movie have played with emotions, not everything is sad and dull, there is a lot of humor as well. The scene where Nicole wants to serve Charlie with the papers has to be one of the best scenes in the movie, it shows the complete chaos that happens in a family.\nThe couple had agreed to solve everything by themselves and make sure that their son does not feel the wrath of the divorce. But when Nicole moves back to LA, she becomes a totally different person, in her terms she's finally free and can make decisions and choices of her own. Henry, their son slowly loses interest in his father as he enjoys his mother's company more. Charlie does not give up on his son easily, he in fact fights for him till the very end.\nYou get to experience the true bitter nature of both the characters when they involve the lawyers. Nicole's lawyer Nora is well known to get the best possible deals for her clients, while Charlie struggles to find a lawyer at first, he later finds someone who was very lethargic in nature. Charlie eventually hires Jay after he realizes Nicole is ready to destroy him no matter what.\nA scene where Charlie and Nicole go against each other is probably one of the most emotional scenes of the movie as you get to understand how bad they could taint each other. The movie ends with possibly one of the best sequences in which Henry is reading the notes that Nicole had made in the first scene of the movie, Charlie reads it and eventually bursts into tears and Nicole stands behind him equally emotional.

But first things first: The writer and director is Noah Baumbach and he has really made many films in the past that weren't seen by too many, but received critical acclaim. So it was certainly only a matter of time until he also gets his big breakthrough in Hollywood and if you have the likes of Scarlett Johansson and Adam Driver on board (yep he is also one of the biggest stars now, not only because of Star Wars), then it is bound to happen unless you really mess up the script. But Baumbach is too reliable for this. He has worked with Greta Gerwig, his significant other, a lot in the past, so it is kinda interesting that his female lead here (Johansson) got no less than two Academy Award nominations this year, one for this film and the other for Gerwig's newest movie. For the latter, her chances were probably better to win, but in the end she lost both, but really two nominations in one year are really a big achievement and I am sure she is happy with that. I know I am because she should have been nominated a long time ago and it seems perhaps that maybe the Academy wanted to make up for omitting her on a regular basis. Adam Driver scored his second Oscar nomination and this is also deserving. He played his part very well and was the reason why sometimes the movie reminded me a bit of Kramer vs. Kramer. You could say it is the 2000s take on a similar subject. Driver did not win the Oscar either, but this was basically only because Phoenix was steamrolling his competition. AD was still considered the only one who could potentially cause an upset for Best Lead Actor. There are many other nominations here, such as Best Motion Picture, but the only win went to Laura Dern for playing a divorce lawyer. Oh well, I cannot say she won me over with her performance here. I mean she was alright, but honestly I feel that the nomination is already too much. This win is as underwhelming as the winner for Supporting Actress last year. Also Dern clearly profited from the fact that she was the only divorce lawyer to Johansson's character (funnily Johansson was maybe the only threat to Dern with her portrayal in Jojo Rabbit), while Driver's character had two and these were played by Alan Alda and Ray Liotta. Two pretty different lawyers. Especially Alda would have been nice to get in.Okay, I already said that I really liked the two lead performances here. They did not only have nice chemistry, but also the ways they brought these characters to life were really entertaining and insightful to watch. The film starts with something positive really that could also be taken from a happy marriage. We hear the two tell us what they appreciate most in their partner. Sadly, reality bites immediately when we find out they are telling this to somebody who is gonna support them with their divorce, but is still not the negative end because Johansson's character's reaction there takes things to a new low. I mean the atmosphere, not quality-wise obviously. And still, these notes about each other play a big role because they are referenced at the very end again in a really touching manner as Driver's character reads to his son what his ex wrote about him and I can see why these final words bring tears to his eyes. This was maybe the only moment when I was tempted to give this film 4 stars out of 5, but I really must admit that I did not like this one here as much as Frances Ha for example and that one received a 4/5 rating from me. Also telling that Baumbach did not cast Gerwig here, for she is really busy focusing on directing now and making her own movies. Okay, but back to this one here. Unfortunately, there were also moments I did not like too much. I thought the singing part with Driver's character added almost nothing for me very close to the end. Or when Dern's character makes a pretty bizarre speech that even involves Jesus. Please don't tell me this was supposed to encourage females and their emancipation. And a third example, although it was not as weak as the previous two for me, would be the big fight. Now this is definitely among the most memorable parts this film has to offer and I liked most of it, but when it really escalates I am not sure I was so fond of it all, perhaps only because I quite like the characters, but probably it was just too much for me and I could think of a couple ways how it could have been written better, maybe more subtle. But the weak (some of it subjective) here is not half as frequent as the strong. The final sequence that also include the notes I mentioned earlier is really good and we see how Johansson's character has moved on (and Driver's partially as well) and they found a solution that works for them as well as their son. But I also noted that Johansson's character's mother in this scene did not have a strong connection with Driver's character anymore, but instead she was joking around with her daughter's new boyfriend, which also felt a bit sad because it shows how time changes everything and the two were so close before that. Okay, I could have done without the reference that the female protagonist is now a successful filmmaker herself, but it's okay. Another thing I did not like too much was that actually Johansson's character went to all those different lawyers to also make sure her husband can't get one of them and that I found a bit despicable honestly and I did not like it because it's okay if the lawyers go up against each other, but this seemed like a really malicious move by her.Like I already said, it is true the two are still married in the movie, but it really feels way more about their (upcoming) divorce. Real harmony is only there at the beginning with this voice-over sequence that tells us a lot about these characters and it was cute how they were pretty different with regard to so many things, but they both hate losing at Monopoly. There is another little fun reference later on about how their son still sucks at it. They seem to be so competitive there. And parents, please play with your children. Really play, I mean. So the entire film is basically about the conflicts between the two as they are heading towards new chapters in their lives. There is this escalation scene and we will never know if Driver's character is correct in telling her that she just searches for something to be unhappy with and that she will never be happy with a guy. We don't know how her new relationship is going to unfold. But even if they initially intended to manage the break-up and divorce in good spirit, it is not working out. Many dark things come to light. Be it the pills (I wondered they weren't mentioned later on by Liotta's character), the alcohol (how she is stumbling down the stairs) or the hacking and on the other side be it the seatbelt, the amount of time he spends with his son, be it his cheating or how she talks about that he never really saw her as an individual human being, but just as a part of himself. This reference is actually even more present on other occasions than in the courtroom. The boy you can also see on the photo, but while it is always a lot about him, also when we don't see him, especially then actually, there is major focus on the two parents instead and the son does not get too much screen time. The exception is the lengthy sequence when the (rather shy) female assessor comes to his home and basically all goes wrong there that could go wrong, most of all obviously how he cuts himself accidentally and falls to the ground when she is gone. We don't find out what happened exactly afterwards. He lost a lot of blood apparently. Maybe the boy called an ambulance or maybe he managed to get up himself and take care of the wound. This long sequence, as entertaining as it was, surprised me a little bit though because Driver's character seemed to be the one who is better structured from the couple, so I definitely did not expect it to turn out like this. Instead I thought that he could easily deal with the situation and really make it work and impress her. But it became obvious that the little chance he had was gone completely now and that he would see his son less frequently in the future. Much less. Still there are some slightly happy references towards the end of the film: For example, Johansson's character still does not want to hurt her ex and she does not want 55% instead of 50%. She does not want to humiliate the one she loved. Maybe still loves, just differently. And the second shot at happiness is that Driver's character now lives really close and can take care of his son more frequently and it won't be complicated anymore because he lives so far away. Overall, with the exception of those parts I already mentioned that I did not like from a subjective perspective, I think this was a really well-written film and the screenplay comes in second after the two lead performances in terms of what I consider the best aspects of this movie. It is definitely worth seeing, especially for couples I believe. Probably not for couples who are about to break up, but instead for those who still love each other dearly and won't let things go as far as they do here when it escalates in terms of one character screaming how he wishes the other was dead and the other comparing her man to his violent father before that. Hurtful. Next when they compare each other to all the family members, it felt so bizarre really. I'd like to close on a high note and mention something I fancied, which would be just a minor moment at the end and again when we have Driver's character read what his ex-wife thought about him, there is a brief reference about his family background and he omits a sentence there because he does not want his son confronted with this kind of malice. Here you have great attention to detail, something Baumbach always brings to the table.",

My husband and I could not understand why her desire to have her own career separate from her husband's was grounds for divorce. And poor Henry being a pawn in all this.The only reason I gave it 2 stars instead of 1 is the acting was very good and the movie was compelling enough to watch the whole thing instead of turning it off after 15 minutes.And what's with all the singing?

            "content": "Noah Baumbach is one of those filmmakers that is highly regarded in the \"Art House\" community for his semi-autobiographical humanistic films. These are domestic dramas heavy on dialogue - the type of film that \"A-List\" Actors swarm to perform in for the acting challenges it brings. His latest, MARRIAGE STORY, is no exception as it follows the dissolution of a marriage and the struggles of the 2 main players involved. The husband and wife are written realistically (according to Baumbach) with moments of pathos and moments of repulsion thrown in at equal measure.So, naturally, Baumbach (THE SQUID AND THE WHALE) was able to draw 2 of the better performers working in film today to play the leads - Scarlett Johannson and Adam Driver - and they deliver the goods (along with Laura Dern) - all 3 were deserved Oscar nominees - and the performances of ALL of the actors on screen are worth watching.But...that's about all this film has going for it. For I found the first hour and a half of this film tedious with (at times) preposterous dialogue that looked good on paper - and was enthusiastically performed - but wrang (at least to me) as unrealistic. Consequently, this film is filled with well acted scenes that I kept saying to myself - \"that was a well acted scene and that was an interesting choice that that actor made in that scene\", but I found that these disparate scenes in this part of the film did not hold together as a movie. It seemed to me a series of acting class scenes and not a film.And, for that, I blame Writer/Director Baumbach. This film, purportedly, parallels his divorce from actress Jennifer Jason Leigh (HATEFUL 8) and it shows. It's a little too \"on the nose\" and \"inside baseball\" for my tastes. The dialogue, at times, was \"too cute\" and the pacing was deliberate - which is a nice way of saying \"slow\".What saves this film is the performances. Johannson dominates the first part of this film and she brings her \"A\" game, bringing a strength and awakening purpose to her character that will have you rooting for her - at the beginning. The first half of the film (for the most part) is Johannson's film and is what gives her her Oscar nomination (she won't win), but she deserves the nomination.Laura Dern is also Oscar nominated for her role as Johannson's Divorce Attorney. Bright, funny, articulate and a shark in the courtroom and boardroom, Dern's character was fascinating to watch onscreen. While I thought this performance was \"fine\" and I was \"okay\" with it getting an Oscar nomination, I kept waiting for the \"Oscar scene\" for this supporting character - and about 2/3 of the way into the film this character had that moment - and Dern killed it. I would now say Dern is the deserved frontrunner for Best Supporting Actress (ironically, over Johansson who is ALSO nominated for Supporting Actress for JoJo Rabbit).This scene propels the last 1/3 of this film into interesting territory - a place that this film had not gone to thus far. I was sucked into this last part and I think it is in no small reason due to the fact that this part of the film is driven (no pun intended) by Adam Driver's character. I've always found Driver to be a fascinating actor and while his character was not front and center much in the first part of the film, he commands center stage in the last part and I could not take my eyes off of his powerful performance. In a strong year of Best Acting performances, he shines and I would be happily surprised and satisfied if he won the Best Actor Oscar.Alan Alda, as usual, brings an interesting character to the screen as does Julie Hagerty (remember her from AIRPLANE?) as Scarlett's mother. The surprise to me was the strong play of Ray Liotta as one of Driver's lawyers - it is his best work in quite some time and shows he does have some acting chops. Finally, good ol' Wallace Shawn (the \"inconceivable\" Count Visini in PRINCESS BRIDE) was fun - and annoying - in his scenes.So...if you want to see some good acting in scenes that I am sure will end up as good scenes in an acting class performed very strongly, then check out MARRIAGE STORY. Just make sure you are well rested. A fast-paced romp it is not.Letter Grade: B (for the strong performances)7 stars (out of 10) and you can take that to the Bank(ofMarquis)",

More a question of growing apart than exerting cruelty upon one another she moves to LA to do a series while Charlie a theatre director remains in NY. What remains important is access to their son and the semi-amicable break-up gets ugly when it gets litigious.Marriage Story is a high gloss soap opera in the tradition of Kramer versus Kramer featuring fine performances from Adam Driver and Scarlett Johansen as the marital combatants. The split is not due to unbridled hatred for each other but lack of communication in which there is more frustration than rage. Writer director Noah Bombach's real villains in the piece are the down and dirty lawyers (played with relish by Laura Dern and Ray Liotta) and the divorce laws that can bankrupt both financially and morally a family.Driver and Johansen display an excellent discordant chemistry with each other amid sterile settings that Baumbach applies some subtle incidentals to but the argumentation eventually grows repetitive with some moments contrived, others rushed and sloppy such as the one in which Charlie is being served. Piling on the suds Randy Newman contributes a score of heart tugging strings and woodwinds that give the impression you are watching a Hallmark Channel film with four letter words. Outside of the lead performances an overlong, banal coast to coast melodrama that goes in circles.",

            "content": "This is a film about the complexity of relationships - how two people can be so deeply connected yet so utterly disconnected at the same time. While the film focuses on a tiny window through the entirety of a decade long relationship, it was a transformational moment, the culmination of years of communication breakdown and growing apart. The divorce lawsuit gave both a chance of reality check - through the eyes of the lawyers and the judicial system, they were forced out of their own narrative to re-examine what happened to their relationship, which roles they played in the sequence of events, as well as how to go forward with the best interest of the child in mind. In the process, they also went from being self-centric and directing emotions outwards, to being more inner looking and empathetic. In the end, decisions about relationships are highly personal and subjective. Good or bad, relationships can never go back to where they were once upon a time. The film captures this aspect of life very well.The actors did a phenomenal job and the music choices are excellent. However, I do feel at times that the film dragged a bit. In additional, beware that many emotional and plot transitions are subtle, yet closely connected. The actors delivered that brilliantly, but not every viewer caught those slight shifts in the details, which is reflected on some of the confusion or frustration about the movie expressed in the reviews written here. It is not a film about romance, or evil lawyers, or parental responsibilities. Unfortunately, the trailer is a bit misleading and some viewers probably had a different expectation going in.All in all, this is a well-made film and I recommend it to people who are interested in movies about relationships that have healthy amount of realism and maturity.",

For a film to be 10/10 it must be perfect, this film was sadly so close but was, however, let down by odd sound mixing at the beginning of the film that lasted for a while.1) The Acting\nThe acting is superb, some of the best of this decade. Incredible. The crying, the shouting, the slight show of frustration, the happiness and desperation they show to one another over the decay of the relationship. The acting is something that elevates the film to such a high degree and allows the characters to feel very real.2) The Story\nThe story is well formulated. Now, I am not an avid romance film watcher, thus I cannot say if the story is unique in the sense of talking about divorce.3) The Characters\nThere are no characters in this film that feels off or out of place. All acted well and non felt still. The sister of the wife (Scarlett Johansson) did feel a tad bit over the top/comical. Otherwise every character had a depth to them. A motivation that made sense and both had benefits and flaws like people do.4) Cinematography\nThe cinematography isn't anything overly special. However, it does the job and is some instances looks very nice to beautiful.Overall, very well made film that I would recommend.",

            "content": "This is a tough movie to watch if you've been divorced or are thinking about it. And even if you're happily married for that matter. At the same time, the story seems realistic enough that you could picture two people going through this experience with all of it's emotional highs and lows. As a couple, I couldn't actually relate to Scarlett Johansson and Adam Driver as characters married to each other. Driver in particular doesn't strike me as the leading man type, but that might have been for the better as the reasons they got married in the first place were eloquently spelled out in the pair's individual letters to each other. My first instinct about Nicole Barber (Johansson) was that she was entirely non-cooperative with the marriage counselor who was trying to help them understand why they fell in love with each other. Writing out their feelings seemed like a worthwhile project, but for Nicole not to share the information seemed quite unreasonable. As the story progresses however, we learn that the give and take in the marriage was pretty much one sided with Nicole doing all the giving, and Charlie (Driver) doing all the taking.Enter the divorce attorneys and the situation takes on a grim aspect. Alan Alda's brief stint as Charlie's lawyer was quite comical actually; his unintentional (or maybe intentional) way of double talking was quite amusing and had a way of driving Charlie batty. The eventual sparring between Nora Fanshaw (Laura Dern) and Jay Marotta (Ray Liotta) managed to negate the intended peaceful resolution to the divorce which had been premised by the Barbers when they first began thinking about it. As for that social worker (Martha Kelly) who called on Charlie and son Henry (Azhy Robertson), well, she looked like she could have used a good intervention herself.The sad thing for the Barbers after the fact is that the marriage could probably have been saved had they allowed themselves the time and distance to come to terms with their situation. Instead, there was no happy ending here in the traditional sense, Nicole and Charlie each went their own way with no sense of fulfillment or closure for either one of them. I could have done without that theatrically inspired ending with Charlie singing to his friends at the bar back in New York. It wasn't particularly entertaining, and if you noticed, no one clapped their approval. Which is kind of the way the story leaves you feeling as a whole.",

Even likable Scarlet Johansson can't save this one from being unlikeable, cruel and selfish. I bet they wanted to present her as kind and sweet and reasonably angry and him as cheating ahole but they failed. I mean, I had failed marriage and it was bad, but I didn't have any need to burry my ex in any way financial or other. I understand that someone can be angry about certain things but this was just too much and again it presents women as these revengeful, selfish and unforgivable shrews while men are totally unaware of everything, confused and shocked all the time while she is taking literally everything from him. That is supposed to be \"romantic\" drama about \"marriage\"? It's more like Hollywood fake drama about two fake, selfish showbiz individuals who don't love or care for each other anymore so they (mostly her) are trying to hurt each other as much as they can. They tried, oh so hard, to portray woman as kind and sweet and justified, but they failed. Everything she does is just for revenge sake and to hurt father of her child as much as possible and take everything from him. Why? We are never told. It was hinted he had an affair but later we find out it was AFTER she already kicked him out to sleep on couch and they stopped caring for each other. Suddenly after a year of dull, loveless marriage she literally commits a crime by hacking into his account, finds out he cheated (after a year of dull, loveless marriage), and suddenly gets super angry, crushing him like a bug while Adam's character looks like helpless, man-child who is suddenly thrown into meat grinder and can just observe how his life and all the work is taken away from him. Who are we supposed to root for here? It's a 2 hours long meaningless fight with no twists or growth or resolution, just depressing, sad and boring.

            "content": "A well made drama about family love, sacrifice, denial, conflict, failure, change and acceptance. A very down to earth \"real life\" film with a very strong script and superb acting by well established actors who were able to showcase their acting skills at a higher level (especially the casts that portrayed the parents & lawyers) due to the good material and directing in this film. Even the main child actor did a good job and looked genuine in delivering his role.The movie portrays the beauty of family life especially the small details of affection and the act of taking care of each other whilst slowly revealing the underlying resentment of unresolved conflict, unkept promises and unfulfilled ambitions, from both sides in the relationship.The movie also has a late 80s & early 90s vibe to it due the hairdos, dress ups, furnishing, sets and the colour tone of the movie even though you can see it is not truly set in those periods by the look of the cars, handphones and other technologies seen in the film. All this done in a good way to catapult your mind deeper in the drama and especially nostalgic for those who were kids and adults during those eras.I think some aspects of the movie pays homage to the film Kramer vs Kramer which was great.",

Adam Driver and Scarlett Johansson shine in this film of a married couple divorcing. The film starts off with a bang and continues to get better as it goes along. The use of white colors in the background to contrast the dark feelings of the divorce is brilliant. The actors show real emotions and the drama is brilliant. The film's jokes almost all landed with me and I found myself laughing many times during this movie. The divorce lawyers are played in the cliche but in this film it seems to really work. The divorce plays out quite realistically and the ending is quite fitting. Also Adam Driver can kinda sing, who would've thought. This film, like many other from Netflix, is great.",

            "content": "Marriage Story is much more about the small actions that are indicative of character than big showy claims, and is so much more effective for it. Even as the story is about how a divorce happens, it's so emotionally charged because we grow to understand what their love was built on in the first place. Driver and Johansson are both absolutely exceptional, and I wouldn't mind at all if they won the two acting awards at the Oscars (especially if Nyong'o for Us and Pitt for Ad Astra don't get nominated, as it's looking). Johansson is particularly electric, showcasing her character's alternating anger and consideration. Baumbach's script is excellent, showing each character's side fairly and honestly, allowing us to empathize with both while never demonizing anyone. It's that honest, human heart of the movie that brings out the unexpectedly caring touches, like the shoe tie at the end, and the unexpected brutality, especially of one argument. It also makes plain the absurdity of the legal system, specifically in divorce, as it cost both of them boatloads of money while severely straining their relationship and not really getting either person what they wanted. In some ways, it feels like a faithful adaptation of a really well-written character driven contemporary fiction novel, where the characters are given space to be understood and where each interaction has such high emotional stakes. Extremely well made from start to finish, the ironically titled Marriage Story is intimate and deeply, honestly sad.",

Often we stay in his perspective, follow him as he takes phonecalls from her et cetera. ... yet the film 'acts' like it shows both personalities and motives equally.\nTo me it would have felt more real if both sides where shown equally.Yet, the beginning of the movie was one of the best parts, the love letters felt - real. All the little things that makes a partner great were named... even if the main characters could not see them anymore at this given time. I know that this part alone defeats the purpose of this film, but for me - that is what inspired me personally for my own life and relationships.Well done (even though it was not my favorite genre).",

Though I think Adam Driver should've gotten an academy award just for \"The Argument Scene\" only, Scarlett Johansson's performance can't be taken lightly, the proof being the \"Monologue at Nora's Office\" scene, for which Laura Dern got her, very well deserved, Oscar. But what really makes this movie what it is, the absolutely insanely brilliant directing and editing. I loved editor Jennifer Lame's work on the 2018 supernatural/psychological horror masterpiece Hereditary and even though I haven't seen any of director Noah Baumbach's films, Marriage Story (2019) is proof enough for me how much of a great director he is, and I'm intrigued to explore his whole filmography.

While then elites see this story as sad, but the 'new norm'. We commoners see a structural problem. We might ask who wrote these perverse laws that allow lawyers to make out like bandits while leaving their clients in debt and acrimonious. We even ask is the ScarJo character even had good reasons to want a divorce from a marriage that seems almost idyllic.People in middle America tend to remain married and consider the best interests of their children and their family, its not always about me me me. People like the ScaJo character think they have something profound to give the world, more often than not, they don't.The delusion of the elites was never more evident than the latest Academy Awards. Its astounding that this film was nominated and even won an award. They are so intellectually and culturally bankrupt that they are scaping the bottom of the barrel. 20 years ago, there would be so many great films that some all-time great films weren't even nominated.

I don't have a problem watching the same story told in a different way but this wasn't even that. This was the same story told in the same way just with different actors. Basically unhappy marriage. Husband cheats. Marriage explodes. The sticking point is who gets the kid. The one interesting take was the nature of motherhood vs the nature of fatherhood.

He breathes into his character so much life, and in one particular scene (you'll know it when you see it) I broke into tears because of how well he delivers a line and how believable it is. It's not necessarily the line itself, it's all about the delivery and I truly believe that no other actor could deliver it as powerfully as he did. Joaquin Phoenix was absolutely mesmerizing in joker and should take the Oscar if any other year, but Adam driver gives the performance of a lifetime and will surely give Phoenix a run for his money at the oscars.",

            "content": "There have been many films over the tears that have covered the end of a marriage and divorce. Kramer vs Kramer is probably the most famous one but this subject has been covered many times. A Marriage Story presents it in a very sober and matter a fact way. It is presented in a very real way. Scarlett Johansson and Adam Driver play Nicole and Charlie, a couple with a son that live in New York. Charlie is a theater writer and director. She is an actress that works with Charlie's theater company. When she was younger, Nicole was in a movie that gave her a little notoriety. She lived in LA but when she met Charlie she went to New York. They have decided to separate. They agree to go through a mediator to not involve lawyers but in the mediator's office he asks them to read the good things that they feel for each other out loud. Nicole refuses. She is going to take her son and go to LA to work on a TV pilot. Charlie is aware and agrees with the idea that she and his son would be back not fully realizing the marriage is over. Nicole is living with her mother in LA. Nicole goes to a lawyer in LA and is going to serve Charlie with divorce papers as soon as he comes to visit their son Henry. Nicole can't serve him the papers so she asks her sister Cassie to do it. This film is certainly a drama but their are many funny scenes. Charlie gets to Nicole's mother's house and comes in as if nothing is wrong. He gets along with Nicole's family very well, they love him too. He seems blindsided with the divorce papers. He thought that the move to LA would be temporary and Nicole would come back. Not the case. Charlie feels that they can work the divorce between them without lawyers. Things have changes. The film has alot to say about how people that still even love each other become enemies when they divorce. The most simple things become legal battles with each side's lawyers trying to make each of the former couple look like horrible people. While sucking them dry financially. Nicole's lawyer is Nora played very well by Laura Dern. She is very nice but a very good, brutally effective divorce lawyer. Charlie first hires a lawyer named Bert played by Alan Alda. He is an old style, lawyer, wanting to maje the divorce as painless as possible. He is not strong enough to tangle with Nora so Charlie hires Hay played by Ray Liotta, who us more of an aggressive lawyer for court. There is not much running time spent in the court room scenes bit it is clear that both Nora and Charlie are horrified at their lawyer's tactics at making each them look like horrible people. The maddening thing about this relationship is that it is obvious that these 2 people care very deeply about each other. The relationship is portrayed as being mostly respectful but of coursethere are many problems. As a viewer I asked myself many times why didn't this couple try to work it out? There is a scene that they try to gave a conversation without the lawyers but all of the legal fighting brings out the pent up anger in both of them and they have a horrible fight. Ultimately, things get worked out and both move on. The film doesn't necessarily sude with either of them which is good. The film to me explores the fine line there is between love and hatred in marriage. It's obvious that Nora and Charlie care about each other, but that is not the only thing that could keep them together. The film is hopeful in the way that it portrays to parents that both love their son ho through what must be a horrific process. Divorce.Grade: B+",

There are countless scenes in the movie where the characters emotions are portrayed in such a subtle way and as a viewer you get how they feel, you can see it in their eyes voices etc. and not just cause they cry a whole lot.This amount of character work is portrayed by the 2 amazing main actors Adam Driver and Scarlett Johansson, its probably one of, if not the best career performance for both of them.This movie makes almost every other Family or most Dramas in general look shallow and unbelievable dull.",

            "content": "Despite the constant barrage of films that are meant to excite, bewilder and entertain, there will always be an appetite for those that feel gritty, real and make you use your brain. This is the case with 2019's Netflix drama 'Marriage Story.'In typical Noah Baumbach fashion, there's a lot to unpack here. 'Marriage' looks at the unraveling relationship between two middle class Hollywood types (Scarlett Johansson and Adam Driver) and how they deal with raising a son during a divorce. Unfortunately, this strikes very close to home for many, which is partly why it has found an audience. Unlike the personal dynamics at play here, the plot is relatively straightforward. Just like the flight path between New York and LA (and back) - a typical one for this industry - we alternate back-and-forth like a ping pong match, with Johansson and Driver trading barbs and trying to one up each other around every corner.The real intention of 'Marriage' is to show off the acting capabilities of our leading and supporting cast. While Driver surprises, ScarJo comes off as forced and one-dimensional; the role of Nicole was written for someone who has much better range. And while Laura Dern dazzles as established divorce attorney Nora Fanshaw, she could be accused of rehashing her portrayal of the similarly cutthroat Renata Klein.'Marriage Story' is a long, downward spiral that may make you think, but it also leaves you feeling pretty depressed. Some argue that it's an amazing team performance that should be celebrated, but it's just not a fun watch. At all.",

            "content": "'Marriage Story' is inspired by the experience of its own director. Baumbach himself has been divorced from Jennifer Jason Leigh and has used his parents' divorce as inspiration for his previous film. He said, \"I have a real connection to the material ... but I was also at a time in my life where many of my friends were getting divorced. I saw it as an opportunity to do something more expansive, so I did a lot of research. I interviewed a lot of my friends, and friends of friends, and then also lawyers, judges, mediators.\" Adam Driver perhaps has shown one of his best performances yet, having most well known for a HBO TV Series 'Girls'.The opening and closing scenes work as sequences and works well together, without giving away the plot of the film. Most of all, this is a film that looks really realistic since it is based on quite a lot of research. People do not have to be married to understand this film as the film will definitely show us how it feels to be main characters, Nicole and Charlie. The film also built empathy for both characters even though they are experiencing divorce. This is something really rare as divorce is often depicted as husband or wife's fault but never both. Here's a review of how the film uses editing for empathy, which really works well with the script-writing, acting and directing of the film.",

And the process is tough and raw actually sometimes painful to watch. Enter the wild cards that being the lawyers to help steer thru the rocky waves. Watch Laura Dern shine as a tough yet smart elegant divorce attorney named Nora.This picture shows how all involved are affected and the damage that a divorce does it's like an ever lasting wound since a kid is involved.

The cast was proficient that's it!This was a kitchen sink I just didn't want to see. Their sexless marriage had precipitated a tawdry affair and this had destroyed any trust they had, hardly a revelatory story!In terms of acting the performances were unvarying and very much on the surface, I didn't even like them so I really didn't care how the plot developed. I learned many years ago that if there is no passion at the beginning of a relationship there will certainly be none at the end.I must say after the court case this picked up somewhat where they all said things they didn't mean and then regreted it but it was so forcefully melodramatic I laughed out loud.

I wasn't a fan of Randy Newman's score which I felt was slightly overused and played at some inappropriate points which took me out of the reality of the film.

The movie follows two characters, Charlie and Nicole Barber, played by Adam Driver and Scarlett Johansson respectively. Both characters are complex and flawed, each of them experience their own problems as they go through the process of divorce. I think the movie is flawless and executed masterfully, in terms of direction. I couldn't really find a flaw, maybe a few nitpicks here and there, but most of the time I was glued to the screen because of how well-acted the characters are and how engaging the story is. Dramas tend to be sappy and melodramatic, this movie feels real. This film explores the messy legal side of divorce where all bets are off and everything is a free-for-all, as well as the touching moments between child and parent. You feel for these characters and you want both of them to come out on top. To evoke such emotions is the hallmark of an amazing film. There are intense emotional scenes that just drains you and makes you empathetic towards the characters. There are also calm and moody scenes that makes you reflect on the characters and the journey they undertook. The music was great, very melodic and nice for the ears to listen to. It fits very well in the movie and serves as to set up the tone of certain scenes, establishing a mood and calmness in the audience. Felt very early 2000's, and the movie does have an early 2000's vibe with its aspect ratio and how the story is presented. In my opinion, this film totally deserves the award claims it is getting, it is an emotional, heartfelt character driven story and I totally recommend it if you have the time or in the mood to cry. Movie had me all choked up and I teared up a bit watching it.Rating: 10/10",

So we already have seen movies with this subject matter that is divorce; but this movie portrays this subject so down to earth, and I don't mean to say that a divorce is an easy process to pass, it is not, it is difficult, painful, sad and can show the worst part of a person, and this movie is exactly like that, we see the character at there best moments but then we see them in there worse. This film works because of the great directing, realistic performances, scarlet just showed some of her most powerful acting that I could feel her feelings.In conclusion , this movie is beautiful, sad, funny and dramatic, all these elements makes this movie one of the best of the year and we're closing this decade with a beautiful masterpiece.",

            "content": "Marriage Story is directed by Noah Baumbach and stars Adam Driver, Scarlett Johansson, Laura Dern, Ray Liotta and Azhy Robertson and is about the struggle and eventual split of the married couple played by Driver and Johansson. I love this movie. Noah Baumbach' direction is some of the sharpest I saw in 2019. You can tell he put time into every single detail which for some people might not mean anything or maybe it's so seem less that you don't even notice that it has an effect on what's happening. He does this thing with the movie where in the first half he kind of makes you side with Johansson, while in the second half he makes you side with Driver. You can really see that they are trying to work things out so that they're family isn't torn apart and so that their kid isn't affected negatively. Even if you haven't been through that you might be able to connect. Johansson gives the performance of her career in my opinion as she brings this humanity and vulnerability to this character which many other actresses could have easily not gotten through with the emotion or make her the villain some how but Johansson finds the perfect balance here and could not see anyone else playing her character. Adam Driver gives another amazing performance here. I truly felt for his character as he's getting dragged into this legal mess that is a divorce. I gotta give props to Ray Liotta and Laura Dern who make me hate their characters but still make them so human and understandable. The look of the film is unique with the framing of the film making it seem like it was filmed in a video camera and so does the color in the film. The score too is incredible and I have to say without the music of Randy Newman some the emotional scenes could have felt cringeworthy or unwarranted but thankfully they land. I watched for the third time recently looking for flaws and I could not find a single one. I am going to give it a 10/10",

            "content": "I heard about this film during Awards Season, made by Netflix it was receiving many nominations in various categories at the big award ceremonies, and it was rated well, so I looked forward to it. Basically, Charlie Barber (Oscar, BAFTA and Golden Globe nominated Adam Driver) is a successful theatre director in New York City, and his wife Nicole (Oscar, BAFTA and Golden Globe nominated Scarlett Johansson), a former teen film actress, is the star of the company's latest production. The couple is experiencing marital troubles and sees a Mediator (Robert Smigel), who suggests that they both write down what they like about each another. But Nicole is too embarrassed to read hers aloud and they decide to abandon marriage counselling. Nicole is offered a starring role in a TV pilot in Los Angeles, so she decides to leave the theatre company and live temporarily in West Hollywood with her mother, taking the couple's young son Henry (Azhy Robertson) with her. Charlie decides to stay in New York, as the play will be eventually moving to Broadway. Despite the couple agreeing to split the divorce settlement amicably and have no lawyers, Nicole hires family lawyer Nora Fanshaw (Oscar, BAFTA and Golden Globe winning Laura Dern). Nicole tells Nora the full story of her relationship with Charlie, the gradual feelings of neglect by him and how he rejects her ideas and desires. Nicole also mentions that she thinks Charlie cheated and slept with the stage manager of the theatre company. Charlie travels to Los Angeles to visit his family, revealing that he has won a MacArthur Fellowship grant, but Nicole serves him divorce papers. Charlie meets with brash and expensive lawyer Jay Marotta (Ray Liotta) who urges him to fight dirty, but Charlie returns to New York without hiring him. Nora calls Charlie and urges him to get a lawyer soon or risk losing custody of Henry. Charlie returns to Los Angeles and hires empathetic and retired family lawyer Bert Spitz (Alan Alda), who goes for a more civil and calm approach. On Bert's advice, Charlie rents an apartment in Los Angeles to be closer to his family and strengthen his custody case. Charles wishes to avoid going to court, so Bert arranges a meeting with Nora and Nicole. Nora argues that Charlie had little respect for Nicole's wishes to move back to Los Angeles and that Henry would prefer to stay with his mother rather than flying back and forth. Bert privately advises Charlie to leave his New York residency, but a frustrated Charlie refuses and decides to fire him. Using his MacArthur Fellowship grant money, Charlie hires Jay. The case moves to court, where Nora and Jay argue aggressively on behalf of their clients and attempt to portray the other party in a negative way. Nora highlights Charlie's past infidelity and emotional distance, while Jay exaggerates Nicole's drinking habits as alcoholism and mentions hacking into Charlie's emails. Meanwhile, Charlie and Nicole remain friendly out of court and share time with Henry, who is increasingly annoyed with the constant moving. The couple are embittered with the legal process and decide to meet in private to talk things through. The discussion starts calmly and friendly, but eventually becomes a bitter argument. Nicole claims he has truly become selfish, and Charlie punches the wall and says he wishes that she would die. He then breaks down in shame and apologises; Nicole comforts him. Expert evaluator Nancy Katz (Martha Kelly) monitors a night in with Charlie and Henry, during which Charlie accidentally cuts himself. Soon after, the couple agree to reach an equal agreement to finalise the divorce, although Nora negotiates slightly better terms for Nicole, against her wishes. One year later, Charlie play has been a success in Broadway, while Nicole has a new boyfriend and is nominated for an Emmy Award for directing an episode of her show. Charlie informs Nicole that he will be living in Los Angeles full-time to be closer to Henry. Later, he discovers Henry reading Nicole's list of things she likes about Charlie she wrote down during counselling. Henry asks Charlie to read it aloud to him, he does so, becoming emotional as Nicole watches from afar. That evening, following a Halloween party, Nicole offers to let Charlie take Henry home even though it is her night with him. As Charlie walks out to his car carrying a sleeping Henry, he Nicole smile at each other, and they part ways once more. Also starring Wallace Shawn as Frank. Johansson and Driver both give exceptional performances as the separating couple who try to remain friendly through a difficult process, their highlight is the argument, it is good to see Liotta and Alda appear as well, but Dern does almost steal the show in most of her scenes, including a magnificent monologue moment. The title is probably deliberately misleading, as it is about a marriage ending, it gets ugly when the lawyers get involved and the custody battle gets heated, it is well written, with moving and emotional moments, but a little room for humour also, it is a worthwhile drama. It was nominated the Oscars for Best Motion Picture of the Year, Best Original Screenplay, and Best Original Score for Randy Newman, it was nominated the BAFTAs for Best Original Screenplay, and Best Casting, and it was nominated the Golden Globes for Best Screenplay, Best Original Score, and Best Motion Picture - Drama. Very good!",

Baumbach crafted a staggering drama, full of love, humor, pain and sadness. It's a film about life itself, about the transience of life and how we spend this time with our beloved ones, how they are part of our lives and how we carry them in our hearts, even if they are separated from us.It's that calm, down-to-earth style, in which Baumbach delivers us his story, with his small parts of humor in it, where you even have to giggle sometimes. It's never too much, it's always on point - and when needed, the film gets emotional. The \"argument-scene\" in Driver's apartment is probably one of the best scenes i have seen (or \"scene\" lol) in a long time.With all that composure, that calmness, the film has the ability to be incredibly powerful and move you to tears. I cried, like I nearly never cried in a movie before, asking myself, how a film, how fictitious characters could move me to tears like that. It's amazing to see that movies still have the power to do so and I'm very thankful to Noah Baumbach for creating this great piece of art.",

            "content": "Spoilers ahead!After hearing many good things about this film, and being quite interested in the subject - I've watched it with high expectations. Let me say - this is a very, very honest film. For as long as I can remember having opinion about film as an art form, I cherish movies that bring something personal and human to the screen. Most contemporary films lack this aspect, thus, are almost unwatchable for me. Marriage story is a story about two people who no longer see a reason to be together. Some will argue: oh, but the child!\nBut, the children we raise to become persons for themselves - not to tie them to us forever. I think many couples forget that. Children will eventually leave home but spouses shall remain together - unless there is no reason. I understood perfectly when Nicole Said: \"I will always love him.\" It's not a romantic love - it's love towards another person - a person with whom you shared a portion of your life, but you do not wish to share bed or dinner every night with anymore. That's life. I've had s relationship that ended this way - the guys was my first love, first everything, but, at one point it didn't make sense anymore. Divorce also happens without \"obvious reasons\" as some complained that this movie doesn't show us all the reasons. But, when you lose yourself, when you feel like it's about someone else rather than about the two of you, and to feel it constantly, it can be crushing. Had she stayed with him, I can even imagine the flame of envy starting to spark. Obviously she has no strenght to fight, he doesn't feel like he's doing anything wrong - there are no goodies and baddies here. You can argue: she should at least try! Or say: he is too self-absorbed!\nIn both cases you'd be right - but in everyday life this is what really happens on so many occasions. People will not fight because they've been feeling like this for a long time and at this point they just want their way out.\nAs you can probably guess by now I think psychologically this film is amazing, what bothers me is maybe too biased ending: her getting Tony nomination (I felt like it's there for pure female empowerment, when art isn't supposed to be gender's maid) and new boyfriend while the husband is moving to work in Los Angeles - I felt like maybe the film had more sympathy to her, but, okay. I guess that's Hollywood's toll on this film: that's what's keeping it too much on the Hollywood terms. I said this is an honest film: it's not melodramatic and romantic, it has many practical and everyday problems, thus, I felt it should've ended in the same manner. Also, it nods to the kafkaesque atmosphere of the courtrooms and legal battles as well as to the modern theatre life, which I think is very cool.\nOverall, deserves a watch!",

Every aspect of this film was well thought out, from the direction to the writing to the sets, with Baumbach crafting his piece exactly as it should have been. The most notable driving force of this movie is the acting - with career-high performances all around. Scarlett Johansson was magnificent as mother and wife Nicole, showcasing a powerhouse of emotion through an incredibly convincing and authentic performance. Adam Driver gives perhaps his best performance of all time as Charlie, so immaculate and raw that I was fully immersed in his character right until the end. Any other year and he should have won the Oscar. The confrontational scene between Charlie and Nicole has stayed with me as one of the most moving and powerful scenes, if not the most, I have ever witnessed in a film. The script was perfectly written and the narrative executed brilliantly on the screen and I found it impossible to be unengaged. I cannot praise this film highly enough, it is an incredible piece of work from everyone involved who went above and beyond. Do not let the synopsis or nature of the story put you off, because you will not regret watching this one.Worth the watch? 1000 times yes, an essential for fans of cinema.",

            "content": "The main criticism that this film seems to be getting from the other reviewers here is that the script itself is boring. I just can't wrap my head around why this is what people are criticizing it for. The story wasn't meant to be an exciting on the edge of your seat thriller. It's an incredibly emotional and dramatic story that plays way more on what isn't said that what is. Baumbach paints us a painfully real couple watching the downfall of their marriage. Trying to maintain their own individuality while also balancing being part of a family. Balancing their dreams with those of the people closest to them.Adam Driver and Scarlett Johansson both greatly exceeded all expectations and provided an incredibly real feeling that isn't easily obtained. By the end of it, it doesn't feel like you're watching two actors, it feels like you're really witnessing Charlie and Nicole try to figure out their lives.Highlight scenes were: Courtroom scene, Fight scene, Charlie accidentally cutting himself, Nicole's monoluge to the lawyer, and my personal favorite scene; Charlie singing \"Being Alive\"I seriously could talk about Charlie's singing scene for hours, it blew me away, and it pains me that some of the other reviewers here were not able to feel the same emotion from it that I felt. \"Being Alive\" is a famous broadway number from a showed called Company. The show focuses on marriage and the pitfalls associated with it, culminating with Robert singing \"Being Alive\", vocally capturing the effect that finding love can have on our lives. He acknowledges the good and the bad, but mostly the impact that it can have and the way it can make you really feel alive. Charlie singing this in front of all of his friends is absolutely genius and it's scenes like this that make me fall in love with writing again and again. Charlie, a self-made director who's entire life and career is built on just how much he loves theater, and you can tell from the way he speaks the dialogue parts that he knows this play well. His singing is the perfect mix of: someone clearly involved in the arts who's knowledgeable about singing, but also someone who clearly isn't a singer. He's still just the director and he'll never be the lead actor. The pain in his voice and emotion he is able to deliver in just that scene, for me, makes the movie one of the most emotionally moving movies I've ever watched as well as places it up there with some of the greatest dramas to ever come out of the movie industry.Overall, I highly recommend this film. Don't go into this film expecting to just enjoy the story and move on with your day, you have to embrace every aspect of it. Let the emotion of the main characters sink into you. Allow yourself to feel their pain. Let this movie capture your emotions and it will change how you look at drama for ever.",

When they loved each other, it was so beautifully gentle and touching and when they were at each other's throats the hatred was literally palpable.\nFor me, the absolute pinnacle was the 'dialogue' between the two in Charlie's house. I literally held my breath and was emotionally wrecked by the end of it. Resentful Nicole versus genuinely confused and angry Charlie - masterclass.On a different note, as a parent, I am immensely grateful for portraying a family time as one spent around good old fashioned Monopoly (rather than Nintendo wii and such like).",

Adam Driver is able to convey a sense of anger and exhaustion in his scenes while simultaneously feeling desperate and alone. This requires unbelievable talent that definitely should not be overlooked by the Academy. Same goes for Scarlett Johansson, who is the other stand out performance in this film, due to her being able to play a vulnerable and still understanding character is truly a challenge for almost all actors and Scarlett pulls it off with aces.If you have been contemplating whether or not to watch this please do, you will watch a beautiful story about family and how families stay together even after split apart.",

It is also \"an intimate and personal relationship.\" Nothing makes you more vulnerable than marriage and divorce and most of us are terrified of this. We deny it and avoid it however we can; but either way we are \"hostages to fortune\" as Francis Bacon said.The contract between Charlie and Nicole starts out to be that the marriage will be bicoastal. She is from LA. Though from the Midwest, Charlie is more into theatre so we meet them in New York where he has established a successful theatre with Nicole being his usual leading lady. They have a son and Charlie has come to consider them to be a New York family. Nicole hasn't forgotten LA, and she's just been offered the opportunity to star in her own TV series to be filmed in LA, In a two careeer family who moves? Who compromises?Up to this point, it's been Nicole. The original contract has not been fulfilled. They try counseling first. Each is supposed to share a list of what they love about each other. Charlie is prepared with his list and eager to share it. Nicole has also prepared a list but is not able to share it. Baumbach does not tell us why he reveals it to the discering viewerThe hostages believe everything can be settled amicably but inevitably stumble into their mutual vulnerabilities. It unfolds into a shatteringly climactic fight. The contract had not been fulfilled. The intimate and personal is ripping them apart. There is a son. There are custody issues, financial issues, adversarial lawyers exacerbating issues. Nicole in LA becomes alive. Charlie copes.In spite of some reviewer's biases the brilliance, insight. and compassion of Baumbach takes no side. He portrays no victims nor victors. Eventually, Charlie, ironically, reads Nicole's list - to their son while Nicole watches unobserved.They are no longer hostages to their contract. What they are and may continue to be is symbolized in the tying of an unlaced shoelace., Baumbach does not tell a story. He reveals one.. This is the magic of art.Brilliant writing.

Because there's no arguing throughout the whole movie, except for this one scene, where everything begins civilized enough, and slowly turns into this very deep, dramatic, heartbreaking, emotional fight. That is the moment where Johansson and Driver get to shine, because when the scene happens, it will blow you away! Some of the reasons that it's so effective, is because of the acting, and because there's almost no other lashing out scenes. Acting is great from everyone here, all throughout. Plus the plot and the cinematography is great! I have one issue in particular, that bugged me when it happened. Somewhere past the halfway point, a lady comes in to Adam Driver's house. And the movie - at that point - is so slow and boring. This scene, I think lasted for 5-10 minutes. So, as much as I wanted to put this in my Top 5 ever, I couldn't. It was about 10 minutes too long. But other than that, this movie was intriguing from start to not great scene, then not great scene to finish.",

Amazing writing, every scene served a purpose. There was a good balance of scenes that give you a laugh ( I loved the scenes with Nicole's sister and mother) and scenes with emotions that hit you like a train. Performance wise, everyone is fantastic, everyone feels very natural, and Scarlett and Adam knock it out of the park.

I understand if this is enough for you to rate this film high after the real life roller coaster that so many of us have been on but as a lay film critic, I really expect more.Sorry x",

            "content": "Marriage Story is a deep and emotional roller coaster of a film that follows the relationship of Charlie and Nicole throughout their marriage, separation, then into their divorce. The film highlights all of the emotions felt through the beginning and ending of a marriage, as well as, the considerations two people must make for their children, in this particular case, Henry, their son.At the start of the movie, you gain insight into Charlie's passion of directing plays. As one of his most favorite actors, Nicole, is portrayed as loving acting, or at least being in the light. Similar to the perspectives shown in the 2005 film The Squid and the Whale, this film shows the differences in views that children and adults go through when a family is going through a divorce.The use of close up shots of the actors when speaking, accentuates the emotion felt during arguments, casual conversation, and the back and forth dialogue between attorneys in the courtroom. In one scene, Charlie and Nicole are in the courtroom and their lawyers are discussing what each person deserves when it comes to money. You can tell that neither one of them wants to hurt the other, but their lawyers are so caught up in winning that it becomes a fight of words in who is the better person and who is the better parent. Both Charlie and Nicole lave the courtroom feeling disappointed, hurt, and angry at the other.At the time of his first visit to LA, Charlie is laying in bed with Nicole and Henry. He is reading to Henry and the camera angle is set at the side of the bed. In view is Nicole, with a focal emphasis on her eyes. She is listening to Charlie read and begins to cry. This scene seems to be a mourning of the life they shared together and will soon do apart.Marriage Story uses a plethora of shot techniques to emphasize the feeling and emotion of their words. In a scene towards the end of the film, Charlie goes back to New York, from visiting Henry (and Nicole) in Los Angeles. He has met his theatre company at a local piano bar, which is also presented during the film at different times of their marriage. Charlie proceeds to sing a song, \"Being Alive\". This song puts the relationship of Charlie and Nicole into a viewpoint that they both will love each other forever and that they were both confused during their marriage.Overall, I believe this film was directed in a way for the audience to feel connected to the actors. It was a wonderful portrayal of how a relationship of two people can be viewed completely different by each of them. It also shows that although divorce is normally a horrible experience, those going through it can find bright spots and end up amicable.",

            "content": "Marriage Story I think is a very personal movie for a lot of people. It discusses one of probably the heaviest things to happen to a couple, and having a children in the middle of it can be even more difficult. I personally haven't had a divorce but I am a product of divorced parents. So, in a way I as a child of two divorced parents am reaping the divorce in a way as well.This movie could have easily flopped and just been a tragic cheesy love story between Charlie and Nicole, however, having it be a film by Noah Baumbach, someone who isn't new to making movies about divorce, it was executed extremely well, in my opinion.To start the review of the film off, I really enjoyed the acting in this film. I thought both Adam Driver and Scarlett Johansson's performances are Oscar nominated worthy. Having just seen the total bomb Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker, I'll admit it was weird seeing Adam Driver playing a dad. However, I think his portrayal of Charlie was done well. Reminded me of my POS dad (love you though). Johansson's Nicole and Driver's Charlie really complimented one another in this film and their chemistry was believable. I really like the scene, it's rather popular on twitter, where they have the argument in Charlie's apartment and he tells her, \"I wish you were dead\" then proceeds to pathetically punch a dent in the dry wall was so riveting and engaging. The little things in the writing are what really make this script so great and I feel as if you're an upcoming screenwriter this script shouldn't be slept on.They really could've just made a movie about a couple once in love separating, however, instead they show the legal side of things and really how nasty a divorce is. How expensive it can be and how much it really ruins your life. Being only 20 years old this movie has definitely scared me off from ever getting married in the future. And I love how casual Charlie and Nicole's lawyers are between one another. They act like they're friends from work. And that makes sense since they're both seemingly to be expensive divorce lawyers.I'm really a big fan of Noah Baumbach's style and his films in general. If you enjoyed Marriage story and are curious if there's any other movies like this I would recommend his earlier work titled, The Squid and the Whale.My mom refuses to watch this movie. She tells me everytime I tell her to watc hit, \"i lived through it, why would I want to watch that?\"",

Take that men!\" And I guess that's why this movie has such a high rating, because this is a win for them. It's what they always say: \"Men gotta learn this lesson\". But for us, common people with the right values, this movie has a bad moral, it does not promote equality and family values. It promotes sadness and bad education. It teaches us that is okay to spoil our kids as long as it makes us feel better. It teaches us that even after having kids, it's okay for us to feel more important than our kids. This movie promotes division. And I know, many people will feel relieved that we, as a society, are normalizing the act of divorce, but I don't think we should be doing that. Anyway, about the acting, globally is good, But Scarlett just tries too much. It's not natural, it seems too forced. But woke 2019 will give her the Oscar, I'm sure.

I finally got why Baumbach is held in such high esteem. I enjoyed Squid, Frances, and Greenberg, found Meyerowitz watchable. Far preferred what he wrote for Anderson (Zissou and the exceptional (and also fantastic) Mr Fox). Marriage Story though towers above those. The writing is so nuanced, what happens offscreen so evident and understandable to all, The dialogue is powerful, tender, bitter, and yet also reserved - there are times when you want to scream at the characters to just say the things that in all our lives that go unsaid. But mostly it's how the screenplay paces and drives a movie that is almost entirely about the words spoken - it would work well on stage and even radio - which builds to a satisfying and appropriate end to the movie. (Desperately avoiding any emotionally descriptive words so as not to spoil the end.)Never been a fan of Driver. Girls is mostly what I've seen him in, felt his wildly unstable character was hard to consider well acted. Seen a number of movies he's featured in too, none were memorable performances. In MS though, he delivers a tour de force. A character so well rounded and identifiable that - despite revelations that should make us dislike the character - we empathise and sympathise with, and positively root for him. Oscar material for me.And Johansson. I knew she could act. Had seen it in Pearl Earring, Translation, remembered elements from Vicky Christina, but this is the first time in a good many years that a movie depended so much upon her being able to deliver a genuinely believable character. She does it with aplomb! It's the juxtaposition of our support and feelings for her character balanced in equal measure with Driver's that is at the root of the success of MS. Scarlett is superb.This is on a par with Kramer vs Kramer. Actors and writer/director deserve that level of recognition for a stunningly good movie.",

Then the film does its best to show us how \"sensitive\" these two are to each other in the midst of divorce, even when they hire lawyers to go at it. Okay. Then they try to resolve their differences at an all-party lawyer and client meeting, and it is clear to the husband that his lawyer (the always brilliant Alan Alda) isn't tough enough and he is going to have to spend untold thousands of dollars to fight his wife with a tougher lawyer because his wife is spending untold thousands of dollars to fight with him. (Neither has any money or property to speak of, so where all the money is coming from is baffling, but maybe this gets explained later.) So after this utter shambles of a meeting, the husband tells his wife that he is going to get his hair cut and she offers to cut his hair, and we jump to a \"sensitive\" hair-cutting scene to show...well, what a thoroughly nauseating wimp this guy is. It was at this point that I abandoned the whole thing as unwatchable. Whatever \"real life\" is like, it ain't like that. (Maybe this guy takes the scissors and stabs her with them, I don't know...and I certainly don't approve.).

So many people get divorced. So many people can relate to the bi-coastal life question: one spouse gets a great opportunity in LA or Silicon Valley; do they uproot and move? Another couple struggles with jobs that require regular trips to DC or Boston - do they need to live apart? What will that do to the marriage? What kind of resentment would turning down these opportunities create? It brings out all of these questions and many others...albeit for a thin slice of humanity; the story is pretty limited to the lives of rich white people. And it does reek of the obnoxious \"writers writing about writers\" phenomenon we see so often in Hollywood.Both Johansen and Driver are awesome. The director being a man means the film skews a tad bit more in favor of the man and makes you more sympathetic to him. (The fact that he cheated - she did not - is really glossed over).Despite the movie being about divorce, there is so much love here.

She was presented as that strong character that is very kind, patient and reasonable but she kept acting like the weakest person on earth that depends on other people's decisions. Maybe that's what the movie is trying to say, that the process of divorcing is so frustrating that it makes people make bad decisions and even entirely changes them. I don't know. But I don't think that's it.Great acting though. Great performances from both Scarlet and Adam. I would be happy to see Adam Driver winning an Oscar for this role.

While I'll admit that there were some pretty good performances in this film (notably, Laura Dern was spectacular), there wasn't anything new here that other movies like Kramer vs. Kramer (1979) hadn't covered. Additionally, it was a bit difficult to separate the two leads (Scarlett Johannsson and Adam Driver) from their other famous movie roles, which made it difficult to commit to the premise fully. Plus, movies like Marriage Story are just uncomfortable looks into lives in shambles that probably hit too close to home for some people.It's weird how so many successful elements didn't come together cohesively for me. Randy Newman's score sounded great, but it made the film sound more like Toy Story (1995) than Marriage Story. Likewise, with the famous acting talent present: they had exemplary performances, but it didn't seem to gel with the movie as a whole. I will concede that the opening scenes where the characters narrate what they love about their partner felt almost eerily familiar to my own life and its quirks, but perhaps that's just being able to codify the male and female conditions.If I were to pinpoint one of the biggest things wrong with Marriage Story, it's the awkward moments. Most of these scenes seem to go on too long (like Adam Driver singing) or play to laughs or pity that made me cringe more than produce the desired effect. Additionally, one of the most shocking scenes was an incident near the end that felt like it would have had some lasting impact on the plot but was never mentioned again (despite its dire circumstances). I'm not going to spoil what that scene is, but you'll know it when you see it.A wannabe Kramer vs. Kramer without the heart, I give Marriage Story 3.0 stars out of 5.",

The couple is experiencing marital troubles and sees a mediator, who suggests that they each write down what they like about one another, but Nicole is too embarrassed to read hers aloud and they decide to forgo the counseling.When Nicole is offered a starring role in a television pilot in Los Angeles, she decides to leave the company and temporarily live with her mother in West Hollywood, taking her son Henry. Charlie decides to stay in New York, as the play is moving to Broadway. Despite the couple agreeing to split amicably and forgo lawyers, Nicole hires Nora Fanshaw, a family lawyer, and rants about how she gradually felt neglected by him and how he rejects her ideas and desires. Nicole suggests that Charlie slept with the stage manager of the theater company. Charlie visits his family, revealing that he has won a MacArthur Fellowship grant, but Nicole declares divorce. Charlie meets with Jay Marotta, a brash and expensive lawyer who urges Charlie to fight dirty, but Charlie returns to New York without hiring him. He receives a call from Nora, who urges him to get a lawyer soon or risk losing custody of Henry. Charlie returns to Los Angeles and hires Bert Spitz, an empathetic and retired family lawyer who favors a civil and conciliatory approach.On Bert's counsel, Charlie rents an apartment in Los Angeles to be closer to his family and strengthen his custody case. Charlie wishes to avoid court, so Bert arranges a meeting with Nora and Nicole. Nora argues that Charlie refused to respect Nicole's wishes to move back to Los Angeles and that Henry would prefer to stay with his mother rather than fly back and forth between coasts. Bert privately advises Charlie to drop his New York residency altogether, but a frustrated Charlie refuses and fires him.Using the first payout of his fellowship grant, Charlie rehires Jay. The case moves to court, where Nora and Jay argue aggressively on behalf of their clients, leading to a series of character assassinations; Nora highlights Charlie's past infidelity and emotional distance, while Jay exaggerates Nicole's drinking habits and threatens criminal action for hacking into Charlie's emails. Meanwhile, Charlie and Nicole remain friendly out of court and share time with Henry, who is increasingly annoyed with the back-and-forth.Disillusioned with the legal process, the couple decides to meet in private. However, a friendly discussion in Charlie's apartment turns emotional and vicious; Nicole claims that Charlie has now fully merged with his own selfishness, and Charlie wishes death upon her. He then breaks down in tears and apologizes; Nicole comforts him. An appointed expert evaluator monitors a night in with Charlie and Henry, during which Charlie accidentally cuts himself. Soon after, the couple agrees to relax their demands and reach an equal agreement to finalize the divorce, although Nora negotiates slightly better terms for Nicole, against her wishes.A year later, Charlie's play has a successful Broadway run, while Nicole has a new boyfriend and is nominated for an Emmy Award for directing an episode of her show. Charlie informs Nicole that he has taken a residency at UCLA and will be living in Los Angeles full-time to be closer to Henry. Later, he discovers Henry reading Nicole's list of things she loves about Charlie she wrote down during counseling. Henry asks Charlie to read it aloud to him, and Charlie does so, becoming emotional as Nicole watches from afar. After a Halloween party that evening, Nicole offers to let Charlie take Henry home even though it is her night. Charlie walks out to his car carrying a sleeping Henry, and they part ways once more.\nMy Rating: 8/10",

            "review_title": "Cinema as Theatre; Theatre as Life",
            "content": "There are a couple potential problems with making such semi-autobiographical, personal pictures as Noah Baumbach does. One, you probably either need to relate to or be intrigued by the familial squabbling of such middle-to-upper-class New York artists and intellectuals, pretentious or otherwise. Having seen a few of his movies now, from one Baumbach episode to the next, I've found that it gets tiresome fast. Second and encompassing the first hindrance is the underlying philosophy of art as simply being a reflection of one's life. An obvious antecedent for this writer-director is Woody Allen, but say what you will about Allen, artistically his oeuvre isn't that rudimentary. Consequently, perhaps, there's no substantial distinction made in Baumbach's outlook between cinema and theatre (that is, besides the either hypocritical or self-deprecating snootiness within the movie)--both are for Baumbach to play life on a stage, including this second installment, after \"The Squid and the Whale\" (2005), in his intimately cathartic stories of divorce. \"Marriage Story\" is likely his best picture yet, though, because of how it integrates storytelling in life, plays and movies. While the actual story here is about divorce, the structure is about the union of those three stages of narratives; it's a marriage story, after all.Indeed, as the couple's attorneys outline, their divorce battle is over the construction of the narrative. Are they a New York family or a Los Angeles one? Is the theme that he's a philanderer or that she's a lush, he a liar who trapped her in the Big Apple or she a felonious hacker who tricked him into allowing her an upperhand in the custody case over their son? In a relatively even-handed manner, the plot serves both narratives with a dual focus alternating between the perspective of the husband-father (Adam Driver) and that of the wife-mother (Scarlett Johansson). He begins as a director, casting her as the actress in his life, but her move to Hollywood includes her branching into directing, as well, both motion pictures and her life. Legally, meanwhile, the expensive lawyers form the couples' perspectives to be enacted, including on the courtroom stage.While this divorce proceeds, these protagonists introduced as theatrical people, him a director and her an actress, are pulled from (off) Broadway to Hollywood. Aesthetically, there were already indications of this in their ridiculous-looking play, as it included recorded moving images of her beside the actress in the flesh. It's a multimedia performance, which in the larger scheme is a play-within-a-play and a movie-within-the-movie that we're watching. A brief search of Baumbach's biography will suffice to point out the obvious parallels here with his life. Like the male lead, he married an actress (Jennifer Jason Leigh) whose big break in Hollywood was a role in a raunchy teen comedy (\"Fast Times at Ridgemont High\" (1982)). Both couples, then, had a child and divorced. Baumbach similarly fictionalized his parents' breakup in \"The Squid and the Whale.\"Unfortunately, however, it's not cinema and theatre that divorce in the picture. For the most part, the acting and writing are engaging enough, but some of the blocking and monologues are as conspicuously stagy as Johansson being carried in the play-within-the-play. The long, steady framings and fades to black compound this. Driver's song at the end was ineffective for me because of its theatricality. Likewise, Johansson's first speech to her attorney, what with her walking around while pontificating, came off as especially affected (it works somewhat better when Alan Alda basically does the same thing later in his first scene with Driver). On the other hand, Laura Dern and Ray Liotta are impressive at getting to the point of the story when it's their turn to tell it. The fawning letters the protagonists write of each other that frames the movie's narrative overall is effective, as well. Regardless, it's not the story or the characters here that interest me, let alone how it reflects life and issues of divorce; it's the structure that matters. The case is built and won or lost based on who is directing and how the narrative is constructed.",

Or being the soundman during the production and witnessing a murder, then a rape, then a nuclear bomb hidden in the clown suit. Why not how this happened to a couple of people like you and me, in the environment of one or both of their workplaces. I don't review movies, but this was flawfilled. I found the people acting in ways that might happen in Hollywood, but not with any people I would want to hang out with. (Well, I'd hang out with Scarlet on the set of \"Kung Fu Swamp Beast\". I understand that divorces are frequently much worse than one might of expected This divorce was clearly the Hollywood type. The kind wher one lands a hit TV show...Right at the same time that her partner is asked to direct his wonderful play on Broadway. Did that many people really fantasize about their lives being like these guys lives. I see nothing else that could account for the high rating",

I know the point of the movie was to say that Love isn't enough to keep people together but I feel like that is only true when those in the relationship decide that they won't fight for their love anymore. Which I guess we see the couple in this movie do. They stopped fighting for their love. There were so many times where they could have made a very effortless course correction and made it work and in turn have a stronger relationship, but for some reason neither chose to speak up and fight for their love. So I guess, it makes sense why they divorced, but it was such a tragedy for me to watch because it was so unnecessary. But I know this happens in real life, so this movie is very accurate to real life. It was very beautifully written and acted. Definitely worth watching. The characters are engaging and you see each persons side. Just sad to watch a couple who loved each other give up.",

            "content": "A marriage story is an allegory of many of the things that can go wrong in the process of a divorce, when the two people involved are attempting to find a peaceful and communicative family system. At the onset the protagonists, Charlie Barber (Adam Driver), Nicole Barber (Scarlet Johannson), were selecting a really sensible option by opting out from getting lawyers and not be bombarded by all the legal liabilities of getting lawyers and going to court, but their naivet\u00e9 demonstrated them that life is not that simple when two people want to start a new life and share responsibilities and, most importantly, a child.Adam Driver displays a clear ability to play a character that is authentic, rational, taciturn, rigid, but yet friendly and emotionally available. I believed in his character, despite exuding deficits at showing emotion in key scenes of the movie. He is the stereotypical character that thinks before he speaks. Scarlet Johannson plays a more emotional, passionate, impulsive, and confused character that is afflicted by her partner's selfishness. She married at a really young age and had no time to explore her needs and wants and ultimately existed in the shadow of her husband. The movie was a perfect opportunity to experience both Adam Driver's and Scarlet Johannson's range, histrionics, chemistry, depth in persona, but I think both of them fell short on what they could have delivered in the movie. The scenes of high emotionalism were not arousing simply by their performance but needed forced cinematographic inclusions to be able to amplify our sensibilities.I have a bit of a gripe with the title. The movie unwittingly implies that marriages are like what is shown in the movie without being accurate about its depiction. It is more consistent to call the movie a divorce story rather than a marriage story, but I assume the narrative wanted to make a statement about the qualia of marriage in the twenty first century.A marriage story is not in any level a bad movie, but it had so much to be able to reach Excellency. The characters are multi-dimensional. We get a cross-referenced perspective of each protagonist that adds so much to the movie. It is not only a story of these people damaging and hating each other. We see how much they care despite all the disagreements and difficulties. The gestures shown by both add to the tenderness and beauty of their relationship. This care is maybe what could have been dealt also in a more conceptual way and less in heavy handed scenes that seemed disappointing, but it is nonetheless a complex and nuanced cautionary tale about the effects of selfishness or lack of empathy in relationships.",

I thought Nicole was a b.... in this movie, she's manipulating her son to the point where he gets a 'treat' when he's capable of spending a day at his dad's like \"Phew I know it's so awful to be with him have a treat.\" Adam Driver did an amazing job, he really fits the role. Charlie is a big guy but he's so kind-hearted. He wants the best for his son while not hurting Nicoles feelings. I really didn't know who would end up with the custody of the child. Although Charlie was trying so hard Nicole had such a good lawyer that she probably would've won. I think what made this movie not boring is the cinematography. I loved some of the shots so much. Let's take the shot were they were both in the train while each being on a separate end with the pole in the middle separating them. They did so good with shooting the scenes. I loved that some shots lasted up to 5 minutes which only made it more realistic. So I wouldn't watch it again for the storyline.

Kramer Vs Kramer 2: the squeakquel revenge of the fallen judgement day etc. The father is the playwright, director stage company head honcho dude and the mother is the failed movie actor star of the plays. They both want big careers but have a kid it's one of those movies well done in areas. The lovey dovey actor stuff in this is both funny and cringe maybe that's the point. They are after all special. Man why were all the characters so unlikeable even the kid was a mothered little you know what, however he came off like the selfish parents that made him that way getting everything he wants. I looked at reviews such as \"these people are privileged and white\" which is racist in many ways, so black and brown people can't be privileged and successful huh?yeah I get what you are in trying to be woke you look worse. These people worked hard and have made money and get grants the mother may have well off parents most people in film do, black and brown people also get born into privilege and work to attain it so don't throw around that stale 2016 buzzword it's a trope in life now and a clich\u00e9 and it shows a very narrow view of life. Also isn't Adam Driver Jewish? All people of any race can be privileged and narcissistic, go to Hollywood. I both liked and hated this film it made the father seem like a clich\u00e9d idiot that can't even pick what he wants to eat on a menu to the mother being an alcoholic that overtly mother's the son. It's almost 2d in its depiction of marriage and mothers and fathers yet they both want successful careers at the expense of their son yet they obviously love him. Then it would be 3d in its depiction of parents as they have honest reactions that they give each other as the divorce heats up that is fueled by divorce lawyers and the system which is very predatory and pantomimish, almost turning the parents and divorce into jerry springer characters. The feminist angle in this is funny that the female lawyer espoused that mothers are held up to a higher standard than father's seeing how I've seen women get away with smashing a glass in a man's throat with a \"just grow up\" from the judge as they do no time. No, women have no privelege. Most father's get screwed in divorce court to have a female lawyer spout out all that jargon about mother's being held to a higher standard almost had me fooled. Linda Hunt as the lawyer was good would rather of had a drama about Ray Liota Vs Linda Hunt divorce lawyer satire maybe? Make it happen Netflix. At times this movie had music that felt like it was in another movie like As good as it gets but this was not a happy ending it made no sense that your wife still loves you but she is dating someone else? I mean the reading of the letter left me thinking the mother actor was a lunatic that she would do things contrary to her beliefs then she confesses that she understands why her husband loved his work so much and neglected her because she has become him at the end lol making her look like a hypocrite. I think the Mother just wanted back on that carrousel that women go on in their 20s but without the reality. It also seemed as if the director took side mostly with the wife making her almost perfect and her problems were not focused on enough in the movie. neither of the characters had any self awareness either which is a writing problem these days. It had mixed messages to be honest you know when Patrick Bateman says,\"this confession has meant nothing\" in American Psycho? I felt that at the end that the directors confession about marriage meant nothing. No new information was found. I felt jipped out of a profound message that it was just some pretentious socialites complaining about life whilst off screen some homeless guy fights a rat over a slice of pizza. They should have added that guy into the mix. Overrated but at least better than most Netflix movies which are shocking bland.",

Everything is too typical, like ordinary friend or family member all of as can see even without movie. Ordinary relationship without anything interesting or meaningful happening. Can't believe this got Oscar. Too much talk, negativity in form of hate and arguing and disappointment. The only good thing about this movie it that it authentically shows how vague marriage can be even in lives of actors like Brangelina couple who got exactly the same issues shown here. The law issues, the financial issues, and ordinary childish emotional issues, something I need we all need to grow up from, and stop being such a child. No special lesson except made us more aware of what we already know. That legal issues can be expensive and detrimental to couple and children and everybody actually. Just like to even riches and most famous people. I prefer movies with more action, emotions, something rare and special, and not so ordinary like this. Not recommended to watch, except for those who prefer to watch all movies or all oscar movies or just to get oscar's imdb award.",

            "content": "Marriage Story is an amazing film. It's Noah Baumbach's best film. It's a film about divorce.Those three statements are completely unexpected, and I'm thrilled to be saying them. Reminiscent of 70's tearjerkers like Kramer Vs. Kramer, with a pinch of Annie Hal, Baumbach has delivered his most emotionally complete and competently structured film to date, that effectively grips you into the story of these two characters, and the fractured family that they represent. Nicole and Charlie are flawed people, but really decent. They hate each other at all. They'd do anything for their son. But their passions for their art got in the way of a pitch perfect marriage. This is not a couple that should be getting divorced, but they are. Baumbach's message is clear, and poignant. Marriage is a difficult thing. Not everyone is cut out for it. Even people who love each other tremendously aren't meant to be together forever. But even when divorces begin amicably, it's inevitable that it creates an emotional fracture between the respective partners that can rarely be reconciled. In other words, it's heartbreaking. We really root for Charlie and Nicole throughout. We painfully watch them come further apart, when we wish they wouldn't.Scarlett Johannson and Adam Driver give phenomenal performances here. The fight scene between the two of them, as per the climax, is an acting masterclass for the ages. The way they emotionally unravel in front of us is impressively real. Like a true marriage on the outs. The entire film is riveting. Near perfect, has it not been for Charlie's musical number towards the end that felt over-indulgent and pretentious. Noah, you need to get out your own way.",

Of course, the argument sequence is a great opportunity to display capability of Driver and Johansson, but what's more impressive is how they act 'throughout' the movie and pace their performances. Everyday life of Nicole and Charlie is realistic and convincing enough, so when they burst their emotions out, audience can feel them as the characters do. It was really a story about marriage, how it starts and ends without overkill, exaggeration, and blame for any particular one.",

            "review_title": "Emotional and Powerful View of Divorce",
            "content": "The film I am reviewing is \"Marriage Story\". This is a story about a couple going through a divorce. The main characters, Nicole and Charlie, are played by Scarlett Johansson and Adam Driver. The theme deals with the truth of human nature. People change over time and so do their feelings. Although, you can tell they both still have a lot of love for each other but are just not on the same page anymore. They want to divorce, yet they both are very focused on the well-being of their son, Henry, played by Azhy Robertson. Which, the movie begins with a voice-over narration of both characters stating what they love about the other. They are in a therapy session with their marriage counselor. I feel this worked with the theme because the movie starts towards the end of their relationship. So, this is a way to introduce them both to us.\nNicole is originally from California but moved to New York so Charlie could have his theater career. He is now a successful director and Nicole performs in his plays, despite her desire to return to California and pursue her own acting career. In addition, she learned through some of Charlie's emails that he had sex with a woman from the theater. Nicole ends up getting a job in LA and takes Henry with her to her mother's (played by Julie Hagerty). The job was supposed to be short-term and Nicole would return to New York. They initially agreed to work everything out on their own; to not get lawyers involved. However, at the advice of a co-worker, Nicole decides to seek the help of a tough LA attorney, Nora Fanshaw (played by Laura Dern). Charlie then learns he now has to seek counsel, but in LA. He first goes to a tough, expensive lawyer Jay Marotta (played by Ray Liotta). Charlie initially decides not to hire him because of his expensive fees and due to the things he says Charlie will have to claim in order to win the case. An editorial technique used in this film was jump cuts. In this scene, once Henry hears all of this from Jay, he decides he is leaving LA and going back to New York. In the next scene, he is back at the theater in New York. When he returns to LA, he gets referred to an ex-entertainment lawyer who now practices family law by the name of Bert Spitz (played by Alan Alda). After their first meeting with Nicole and her lawyer, Bert advices him to settle and he feels like that's not good enough. It was important to him that Henry knew he fought for him. So, he goes back to Jay and shows up with him at the court hearing. Court becomes nasty as both lawyers try to paint a negative picture of each in order to win. Charlie and Nicole both grow tired and eventually come to an agreement with the divorce and go on to be happy in their own lives and as a family, still.\nThis movie is a good insight on marriage and what happens during divorce. I learned a lot about the laws that I didn't know. I also was able to see how divorce affects the men. This movie was very emotional and the subjective point of view shots really put you in the character's shoes. You're able to see things through their eyes and really feel their emotion.",

            "review_title": "Marriage Story by Noah Baumbach",
            "content": "The stories about divorces are some of the saddest, some of the most difficult as well as some of the most relevant stories, to tell in the literature, movies and television series. To see how the main characters would deal with the divorce, by facing several issues, which would affect to their parents and to their own children. Especially how the pair cannot easily solve some issues, like in once, as they just want to get through the divorce as quickly as possible. Once the main characters are divorced, some stories would end with the pair who live in a separate life, without seeing each other anymore; other stories would end with the pair who live in a separate life, but they see each other once for a fixed time. The filmmaker Noah Baumbach, has been really interested to tell a story about the divorce, by getting the inspiration from his own experience of divorce as well. In order to tell the story in the right way, Noah Baumbach elaborates the movie to be told in the point of view of the main characters; as they express their different feelings, in the course of the movie, while they are struggling to get through a very difficult moment. After a long time of elaboration, in 2019 came out Marriage Story by Noah Baumbach with Adam Driver, Scarlett Johansson, Azhy Robertson, Laura Dern, Alan Alda and Ray Liotta. The movie's plot: A married couple, the stage director Charlie Barber (Adam Driver) and the actress Nicole (Scarlett Johansson), are divorcing; they would face conflicts to increase problems to each other, including to their son Henry (Azhy Robertson). One of the best ways to solve their divorce is to get a lawyer, Nicole chooses Nora Fanshaw (Laura Dern) and Charlie initially chooses Bert Spitz (Alan Alda) until he changes with Jay Marotta (Ray Liotta). There have been some expectations, on how the movie could have been told from the beginning to the end; especially to see how the conflict between the main characters would grow, until they find a solution for them and for their family. The movie has shown some really good quality, to tell such complicated and delicate subject; especially to see how the main characters have been presented, at the beginning of the movie. As the movie tells the subject, both of the main characters' point of views; by using some interesting details, to see how well they know each other. Even the movie does not always apply the narration in the complete way, to balance the point of views of the main characters; by having some missing essential details, which could have been applied in the movie. The production designer Jade Healy has built the sets in a clear and precise way which, thanks to the spaces and the colors of the settings, create visually the images of how the main characters are distant with each other; as the conflict between the main characters grows more, in the course of the story. To make these images even more visual in the frames of the camera, the cinematographer Robbie Ryan has captured in different angle shots as well as in the camera movements, some of the most essential moments of the story; by also getting helped by the lighting, to create valuable frames to be captured. The editor Jennifer Lame has created, in the most precise way, the narration's rhythm of the movie; to be very clear, from the beginning to the end, how the atmospheres can get intense to get lately some uplifting and sweet moments of the movie. The score by Randy Newman has been elaborated by creating musical notes, which has an uplifting melody mixed with funny notes and lately dramatic ones; the score balances the dramatic atmospheres with uplifting moments and funny ones, to be connected with the emotions of the main characters and the themes of the story. Adam Driver did an extraordinary performance as Charlie Barber, a stage director who is dedicated with his works and since there is the divorce, he wants to find a solution for him, Nicole and his son Henry; as he wants to be as close as possible with Henry, even he would lately realizes things are getting complicated. Even there should have been a bit more details about, his loneliness for what he is struggling; if Charlie has any kind of feeling of regrets, while he is facing the divorce; if there were things he wished to have improved, which he has not thought about before; if there are any kind of issues he has with Nicole, besides describing her personality. Scarlett Johansson was excellent as Nicole Barber, an actress who takes some of the direct choices on how she and Charlie would divorce; she lately moves from New York to Los Angeles, to even see what is the best for her son. Even there should have been a bit more details about, her loneliness to see if she is feeling better to be in Los Angeles or not; if her success is affecting her and Charlie, because of the divorce; if Nicole has any kind of memories, she wants to keep about Charlie. Azhy Robertson did a well done performance as Henry Barber, the son of Nicole and Charlie who spends half time with his mother and the other half one with his father; since the divorce of his parents, he is facing some changes which makes him happier. Even there should have been a bit more details about, how the change from New York to Los Angeles has more or less improved personally; if there is anything he is missing in New York; if he has any kind of more or less positive feelings, with his father Charlie and his mother Nicole, since the happening of the divorce; if there are things which he is going to miss, once his parents are divorced. Laura Dern did an excellent performance as Nora Fanshaw, Nicole's lawyer who would do anything to help Nicole to get the right choices. Alan Alda did an extraordinary performance as Bert Spitz, an old lawyer who understands the feeling of being divorced; Bert warns lately Charlie what would happen, if things would be not taken in the right way, to get in some harsh troubles. Ray Liotta did an excellent performance as Jay Marotta, a lawyer who has been chosen by Charlie, after he did not feel satisfied with Bert; Jay would do anything to make sure, Charlie is not going to be in any kind of trouble, neither during the courtroom moment. Marriage Story is a movie which shows some really good quality, to tell such difficult subject; even the movie has presented some missing elements, to be not a complete story at all.",

The storyline is about a woman who left LA because her acting career was going nowhere, moved to New York with her husband, became the main attraction in the theater her husband created, had a child with him at their home in New York, and then decides after eight or 10 years that she wants something else.The \"something else\" is to divorce her husband, move to LA with her son, and pursue a career in television.We watch as the husband has to cope with having the rug pulled out from under him and his life thrown in a blender, to mix metaphors. We see the all too frequent spectacle of divorcing parents, who initially claim that they have their children's best interests at heart, ending up hiring the most cutthroat divorce lawyers they can find.One glaring inconsistency, as another reviewer pointed out, is that no actual lawyers were consulted on this script. Divorce lawyers call witnesses to get the facts on record, they don't argue cases themselves in front of the Family Court judge. Further, under the existing laws, the divorce would have taken place in New York, not California, but that would have meant no movie.The other glaring inconsistency is the wife, who wanted out, appearing to exhibit some feelings of remorse or shame (in front of her husband) at what she has initiated. I know a number of divorce lawyers, and they have all told me straight out that they have never seen this happen with any woman who has filed for divorce.My final complaint about the film is the young actor who plays the son. His height and weight make him appear to be eight to ten years old. However, he can't read AT ALL in the first half of the movie, and in the final scene (after he's been living with his mother and her new boyfriend in LA for a while), he is reading at a level you would expect of five-year-olds. I found this jarring, given that there is no mention of him having mild retardation, dyslexia, or any other learning disabilities.",

The story line of the film is based on the emotional crisis of the male and female masters, who once envied other people and turned against each other after the grinding of marriage, and met each other in the war.In Marriage Story, the heroine was an actress and star with a good future before her marriage. She fell in love with Charlie for only two seconds. Charlie married Nicole in her prime and had a lovely son. In the eyes of others, a pair of natural people have to go to divorce because of their different directions of work, a New York-based, eager to return to their hometown of Los Angeles, coupled with differences in the concept of life.The best part of the film is the quarrel between men and women, the pinnacle of the intensification of marital contradictions. When once the closest lover is at loggerheads, the killing power is devastating, because you know the pain of all my soft ribs. Our faces are red, our mouths are not chosen, and we quickly and quickly pick up the words that can stab each other the most, and when we lose our minds to attack our loved ones, we lose our loved ones at the same time.The Story of Marriage is not only about the collapse of a period of love, but about how to maintain yourself in the besieged city of love marriage, how to live in harmony with our partners, and how to maintain their dignity and dignity. Love is easy to get along with, love when you see all the advantages, get along with exposed shortcomings, learn to self-cognitive analysis, learn to live in harmony with others.",

Both characters are self-absorbed. This couple has champagne problems. Even the divorce itself is far-fetched. It becomes very obvious very quickly that they could have worked they could have worked through their problems had either of them put in even an inch of effort.The son is just there for decoration. Which is also reflective of both of their parenting styles. I don't know what 8-9 year old is struggling with reading the way that he is. But, his character is so underdeveloped (like all of the characters) that we never find out if there was a reason for that. Yet another nod to the poor/lack of writing.The movie also randomly sort of turns into a musical towards the end with both main characters doing a song a each. Overall, this movie is BORING! Most of the scenes have no pay-off. The entire movie has no pay off. There is no reason for that this movie is over 2 hours long. None. Hollywood loves a movie about Hollywood.

The film recognizes with sensitivity and empathy how people fail as couples, parents and people, how they go and how they come. The soundtrack is full of sensations and sensations, in the scenes it works excellently, with heartbreak, loss and melancholy, but it doesn't convey the feeling that it will get better, good things and better things to come.

It is a combination of a love story, screwball comedy, musical, and procedural drama. While the blend of styles at a point comes across as forced, the film as a whole is a brilliant work, telling a story rather than following the genre troupes many films fall into. This is a simple story originally executed.Extremely character driven, the cast play their roles perfectly. Scarlett Johansson and Adam Driver lead the balanced portrayal of a divorcing couple. This film will impact viewers differently depending on many factors, especially their life stage and past experiences with relationships, marriage, and divorce. The film is so well balanced that one viewer will relate more to one character while the person beside them may be more drawn to the other. Regardless of which lead you relate to more, you are bound to be shaken by the deeply emotional performances of both.A nod to the cast would be incomplete without a special mention for Laura Dern and Ray Liotta whose characters come to life in significant scenes of their own. The director shared at TIFF that at many times during filming he felt like he was watching the actor's movie rather than his and this truly shines through in their collective performance. Out of the many films we saw in Toronto over two weeks, Marriage Story likely has the best odds for this year's Oscar wins.",

Toward the middle, we get some perspective to supposedly justify a little of her anger and why she's tired of suppressing what she wants for him, but not so much.

A good mother would have saved that money for her child's education and not squander it.

That's what made it harder to watch- her anger was not justifiable in my judgment and breaking up her family didn't seem justifiable. Moreover, her character ticks off every misogynistic stereotype of a woman- a shrew, malcontent, raging raving and impossible to make happy. I know there are those who will say she felt more fulfilled so that was worth it, near her looney family, but I think she's someone who 2 years later would be unhappy again in CA, just as she was before she met him. One of those who will always be dissatisfied. So it's hard to watch a movie, a real downer of one at that, about people who aren't that likable, although he was more sympathetic than she. Again, Ordinary People, Kramer, Terms of Endearment to name a few, all have people you care about and someone sympathetic to root for. Great performances all around here, though.",

            "content": "The title may seem ironic; 'Marriage Story' is, after all, about a divorce. However as much as it's about the end of a marriage, it's the little moments of love and affection that Baumbach really chooses to focus on. It's an engaging character study and nuanced look at the legal system that is extremely well written and features some of the best performances of the year. Seriously, Johansson and Driver are at the top of their games here, injecting life into their characters in even the quietest of moments. That's where the film really succeeds, too. For a story about a divorce, there are less arguments than you'd expect. Of course, they do happen and are expertly done (one scene in particular is destined to become a classic and is sure to be studied as a masterclass in writing and acting), but it's the restrained, subtler scenes that really create the most emotion, and highlight the strength of the piece. While it's obviously sad and emotionally affecting in that regard, it's also surprisingly funny. Even though it's never hilarious, there's a sense of humour injected into nearly every scene. This is mainly due to how realistically the piece is written, as the humour comes from common, everyday interactions more than jokes. Again, the simple fact that this tone works highlights just how strong the writing is. One of its biggest missteps, however, is its focus on Driver's character, Charlie. After an introduction to both parties, the film begins with a heavy focus on Johansson's character Nicole, then shifts to Charlie's perspective. The problem is that from there onwards the audience sees things very much from Charlie's perspective, even if the flick ensures that neither Charlie or Nicole are seen as a 'villain'. Because it initially establishes itself as a two-sided piece, it does feel a bit limiting that Charlie is undeniably the protagonist. That's not to say that Nicole isn't a great character, however. Whenever she is on screen, Johansson and the writing are great. We do primarily see her from Charlie's perspective, though, which obviously limits things. Luckily, this isn't enough of an issue to ruin the film by any means, and it's something that's more of a problem upon reflection rather than when actually watching it. Randy Newman's score is a little bit of a problem, too. While the music is in itself great, it is very similar to Newman's 'Toy Story 3' (2010) score, so whenever it plays it is simply reminiscent of that film rather than serving to enhance this one. That's a very minor issue, though, and likely something that won't affect most viewers. Overall, 'Marriage Story' is engaging throughout with a great screenplay and subtlety gripping performances. It's certainly one of the years' better films and it's a shame that most people will only be able to see it on the small screen. 7/10",

It is visually not spectacular but it is beautiful; I think that some technical elements of management were wasted as being: the colors and planes a little more symbolic. I think your soundtrack is correct. His performances by the leading duo is totally excellent, the only unfavorable point of this is that Adam in the climax scene steals the role of Scarlett, since it is his character that seems to do the catharsis, obscuring the catharsis of Scarlett , making him feel like this only as a complement in the scene. It seems to me that the greatest virtue of the film is, without a doubt, its script: a script that not only feels light and skillful for the viewer, but feels fresh for the exhibition of the story. I find it eloquent. Totally symbolic and subtle to give the messages of selfishness, megalomania and apathy that are often lived in couples. It is also sublime criticism anti-lawyers and anti-capitalism, showing that putting material and whims before feelings is the ruin of this society, increasingly decadent. 83%.",

It's up to the viewer to take sides depending on their previous experiences and frustrations.The story is brought to life by a lot of apparently insignificant details and episodes that are later reprised in the movie, sometimes with gut-punching effects. The supporting characters' performances are remarkable as well, above all Laura Dern as the merciless divorce lawyer. However, they are limited to bringing some comic relief more than anything. Charlie and Nicole's son Henry gets a lot of screen time, but despite being in the center of the events his contribution is close to nonexistent. Sure, he is the one that coincidentally leads to the final wrap-up, but unfortunately that felt as a forced plot device and as awkward as that scene where they yell at each other.Surprisingly enough, the light and straightforward scenes proved to be the most moving and heartfelt.",

My wife and I watched it last night and, from the beginning, I could tell this was going to be syrupy, self-indulgent, molasses-slow movie that, I assume, drew from his background in theatre and film. The characters in the stock company, the neurotic sister who acted like a child, the child who acted like a brat, the mediator who plays a cartoon character, and the dialogue between the two lawyers that I could visualize being delivered at a table reading kept me at a distance. Then there was the loooooooooong monologue delivered by the lead actress that, as she shared it with her lawyer, seemed so artificial and contrived that I felt sorry for her that she had to read what I'd imagine the writer thought would be an epic presentation. Like the lawyers' dialogue, you could visualize the writer knocking it out and the actress trying to make it real. Instead, all you hear is a Hollywood actress reading a Hollywood director's lines and without the illusion of reality -- which carries all the way through the ten hours of this two-hour film -- it's difficult to get into it.

And they are wealthy, although the film goes through great pains-and artifice-to distance itself from the clich\u00e9s trappings of upper middle class life (so prevalent in 1980s Woody Allen movies) The production design is very pared down, as if the characters are so creative that they have no time for nice things, unlike those vulgar Wall Street people Anyway, good, emotional stories are in short supply in the movies these days, so \"welcome\" Marriage Story. But make no mistake about it, Marriage Story is very mechanical from the start. It announces its intentions immediately with Scarlett Johannson lit like Bibi Andersson in an Ingmar Bergman movie pose: this is going to be a story about motivations and emotional drivers with lots of fighting and tears-even male tears (!) Driver and Johansen are well suited physically. His performance outshines hers because he is the superior actor. She never quite escapes into her role and is clearly the movie star doing serious. When she acts, the words are flung back onto the page. The difference Is most pronounced during their epic argument which never really takes off emotionally. It all seems like a paint by numbers. In the annals of Breakup Porn, Kramer versus Kramer still wins. It has a lot more authenticity and heart and \u00bd dozen memorable scenes. But again, I did like Marriage Story. The supporting cast was marvelous, really too many to name. I fully expect a Supporting Actor nomination for Laura Dern and maybe even Alan Alda. He is a great reminder of how many wonderful octogenarian actors there are out there. Speaking of Oscars, I don't know about the leads. Perhaps it will be Adam Driver, who with his big odd face and imposing height, really is the next best hope for actors.",

Of course, its not admitted openly in the film, but if you watch it with a little bit of distance, you see it. The film would have been much better without a cheesy crying song that Driver sings in a bar at the end of the movie, complaining about his misfortune, and without pathetic reading of the long-forgotten sheet with his \"good sides\" put by his wife while they were still doing a marriage cancelling.We have two people who irreversibly decided to divorce because it seems that both in terms of their private lives and professionally it works for both of them. The problem starts when (off course, like always in movies) the wife gets a famous female layer involved, who actually starts helping her put on the table what she actually wants, and not what her husband expects from her. The whole suspense is going about where the child will be based, NY (which suits the husband), or LA (which suits the wife). So a lot tears will be cried by Adam Driver just because Scarlet Johannson's character will insist on staying with a son in LA. This is obviously not a terrible decision because the kid loves LA, and the husband looks like a guy preoccupied by his work in NY anyway, and with no much patience for the kid, but the whole problem goes about the fact that this is something he did not expect: he believed that she would follow his ideas about the separation, and he is devastated when he discovers that she decided to push what is better for her.The plot is subtly inviting us to sympathize with the husband, simply because he is a surprised party, he is someone who does not have good family network on his own, unlike his wife, someone who is not ready for change, etc, somebody who is pushed out as a secondary parent all of a sudden. On the other side, its clear that for 10 years he had it all on his side : a wife who adjusted her to him and to the role of homemaker, while he was the one in control. The film does leave us with a clear complaint about the fact that, as much as they are privileged in the marriage, men can be severely deprived of that privilege by the divorce. My problem with the movie is that its somehow, still invites the audience to judge this \"change of heart\" in the wife's decisions negatively. We still spend more time looking at Driver's shocked face just because he has to interrupt his directing job and pay lawyers, then the time we have an insight into what actually makes his wife wanting desperately to change her life. The point of criticism is still coming from the instance of white male patriarchy : like, white males complaining about why when they once form a family, it can't stay always the way they want. These are all the flaws of the movie, and with a little bit more work on the script and less \"crying\" over divorced male's tragedy, the film could have been really a masterpiece. But, now, its a kind of decent movie, but with already seen slippages.",

            "content": "Look, I'm in quarantine and I had nothing better to do, so I sat through all the 'Best Picture' nominated films from this year's and singled out 'Marriage Story' and 'Two Popes' as the only two movies out of that bunch that I didn't watch. And Marriage Story was a far better movie to sit down and watch than Two Popes in my opinion.The acting was just...phenomenal. Everyone in this movie acted their chops off in the most heartbreaking way they could. Henry's actor (Sorry, forgot his name) just made me depressed in a heartfelt way. He was the hardest to watch in every scene because I just hated to watch him favor his mom in front of his dad, be fought over like tug-a-war, and looking lonely when he was with his dad. I just couldn't... I simply just wanted to cry with his presence if you understand. I hated having Charlie just watching his relationship with his son fade. Adam Driver, like the kid, broke me. At the beginning I semi-sympathized with Scarlett Johansson's Nicole, but by the middle towards the end, the movie easily made me side with Charlie, even though he's no better.I get that in divorces there's a bad side to each person that has to shine at some point. And at each point, I did come to hate both the leads because of actions they've done, but at the end, they're just humans. They made mistakes, and now one wants to move on understandably. But yet, for the one who wants cling onto a broken relationship and attempting to keep a legal fight going, I sympathized with him more because it was tough watching him hit rock bottom to fight for keeping some form of custody with his son, while simultaneously losing everything and his whole life just to maintain custody.But Nicole also deserves to move on with her life without having Charlie's life consume hers.It got ugly between both sides for sure, and this was hard to watch. But it was a very solid story that made all for a good film worth watching, with a great set of acting and direction.My only complaints would be that but felt too repetitive and slow at times and some scenes felt out of place and random. The crossfading was just awkwardly edited to move on to other scene too. But those were my concerns.In other words, a nice heartwrenchig tale. One for memory. Not perfect, but still not too forgettable.Final rating 8.4/10",

            "review_title": "A Love Story About Falling Out Of Love {criti-cally reviews}",
            "content": "The biggest problem with great movies like Marriage is writing a review about it. The movie is about a couple who due to some differences want to go through a divorce. The movie is a close examination of the process of divorce and how messy it can get, changing people along the way until things get back to normal.Marriage Story movies through multiple genres. It starts of a light, romantic comedy movie. We get to know the intricate details and a personality overview in the first 5 minutes of the film as both characters introduce each other. While we flash through important and daily situations, we hear Nicole (Scarlett Johansson) explain what she loves about her husband Charlie (Adam Driver). Charlie loves being a dad, and how it's almost annoying how much he loves it. He cries easily in movies. He's very competitive, undaunted and is very clear about what he wants. These are only a few things Nicole loves about him. After that, it's Charlie's turn to tell us what he loves about his wife Nicole. She's a great dancer - infectious. She's a mother who plays, really plays. She gives great presents. While we hear this couple recite what they've written down, we get to meet them post-break-up in a marriage mediator's office. This was part of an assignment, to fully understand why they got married in the first place. As we progress the movie knocks you out with a single blow as it switches genres, very smoothly in to a distressing drama.Nicole, a former teen film star, wants to move back to Los Angeles with the couple's eight-year-old son, but Charlie, an up-and-coming theatre director wants to remain in New York. What follows then is an emotionally raw journey into growing up, while trying to figure out how to survive on your own. It wouldn't be a Baumbach movie without a man-child at the center of it. The filmmaker has spent his entire career profiling gifted men who are reluctant to grow up. In Marriage story, Driver plays the same - slightly immature, considerably self-involved, but also capable of decency and warmth. Baumbach's choice of letting Driver express himself fully as the lead role in the movie was a great decision. He is definitely the strongest of them all and delivers an Oscar worthy performance that is transformative, unseen and heartbreaking. It seems all the other actors are feeding off his energy and bringing their A-game to the movie. Scarlett. Johansen has never looked and acted better. From a caring mother, to a becoming a woman who won't let anything come in between her dreams now, Nicole's transformation couldn't have been portrayed better than anyone else. If Driver adds emotions to the movie with his heartbreaking performance, Johansen makes it move forward with her role as a women who still loves her husband, but wants different things for herself.As the movie progresses, we can clearly see a change in Charlie and Nicole's relationship and personality, having to deal with the divorce. Where there once was an intimate and almost wordless understanding of each other, there is now bitterness and resentment, egged on by an almost clinical legal process. The film's most heartbreaking scenes are the ones in which Nicole inadvertently calls Charlie 'honey' in the middle of the most vicious arguments; or when she decides his food order for him during a tense meeting with their lawyers. \"I will never stop loving him,\" she says in that opening voiceover. Which is true. Nicole had become into a woman who knows what she wants and isn't holding back anymore. The only thing she's holding back in front of Charlie - are tears. As if she doesn't want him to see how vulnerable and damaged she is by everything that's changing. \"Love doesn't make sense\", and no truer words have ever been spoken. Charlie on the other hand, who's always been confident and career driven, is now crumbling down, defeated and uncertain of the future.On of the special features of the film is that it manages to get it right that both Charlie and Nicole had their faults and they also had been disrespected in different ways and so the movie conveys the idea that in these situations usually (not every time) the blame is on both, maybe not equally but everyone had his faults. While Nicole turns very sour in the process of the divorce such as going against their joint agreement to not involve lawyers and hiring the most ruthless person in the business, Nora Fanshaw (played by Laura Dern in a scene-stealing performance, giving some specular and hard-hitting truths about gender inequality). Meanwhile, Charlie is not only forced to pay a portion of Nora's fees, but is made to settle for the kindly Bert (Alan Alda), the only person who seems to have an idea of the human toll separations can take on couples. There are moments when you do feel sorry for Charlie and feel Nicole is being too ruthless. But then, when you look from Nicole's perspective, Charlie did have a relation once outside of their marriage which he clarifies with a remarkable line, \"You shouldn't be upset that I ****** her, You should be upset that I had a laugh with her!\". The fault lies in both, some more than the other, which is which is hard to tell.The most important thing the script gets right is the theme of divorce. The movie very closely examines and critics on the entire system and process of divorce, its impact on kids, on how it makes the couples waste a lot of money but most importantly on the hate it creates. Indeed the protagonists starts the process with all the good intentions to split up peacefully but when the lawyers kicks in they found themselves in a fight they don't even want.Baumbach emerges as true master of writing and directing in this movie. The script is very special and the little moments in the story develop the characters and reveal more about their nature. In a particular scene, Nicole commands her mother, who has an independent equation with Charlie, to not interact with him anymore. When he visits them in one scene, he knows exactly where the paper towels are, and which drawer the cutlery is in. Little moments such as this convey reams of information about the characters, whereas lesser filmmakers would've had to rely on pages of dialogue. In a particular scene of a courtroom battle With Charlie's new lawyer representing him after he fired Bert with Nora Fanshaw, we see both the characters just sitting quietly. It's like they weren't even mentioned in the script. It's the lawyers talking, delivering their dialogues and fighting it to, while both the characters are just quiet. But in the scene right before, they were fighting, and for the first time openly venting their anger out to each other. It was such a metaphorical moment that the protagonists, even though they seem calm and composed in the courtroom, have their inner turmoil's and anger and resentment towards each together which they are battling to and want to express.Baumbach shoots pivotal moments in the film in long, unbroken takes, allowing life to just... unfold. There are no flashy cinematic techniques on display here, save for perhaps a couple of pointed visual metaphors like three bedroom doors closing on Charlie all at once. The actors are allowed to roam free; not at the mercy of traditional set-ups but with palpable confidence. They are fluid and the acting seems very natural. The characters seem very human, like someone you would know and real, feeling real emotions, which make you feel with them. The approach is almost like theatre. The set is a playground that Driver and Johansson can explore, as we watch, transfixed at the truth they are able to tap into, again and again and again. The camera doesn't confine them to tight spaces, but offers silent support as they amble in and out of rooms; as they walk through frames and stare directly into its depths. Baumbach makes all of it seem effortless, with unprecedented results. The way he gets his cast to deliver minutes of dialogue, while his Director of Photography, Robbie Ryan, zooms in and out, follows and swirls around them, to then play with shifting between different actor's facial expressions in silent moments, is utterly enchanting. The cherry on top is Randy Newman composing a score that is completely apt and masterful!Overall, Marriage Story is a great movie, with excellent acting, a touching screenplay, an immersive direction and a delicate score. This is one of those movies that will get discussed in film school, years from now. It has everything to become an all time classic and will proudly get called one of the best films of the decade. It is so authentic that watching it occasionally feels like eavesdropping on a couple in their most vulnerable moments. A melancholic, heavy-hearted yet joyously bittersweet story about marriage and its unfortunate path to severance in order to find happiness. It is a love story about falling out of love which guarantees that no cheeks will be left dry.",

Every single aspect of this movie is just very well done. The performances by the entire cast, especially by Driver and Johansson, are one of top class and one of the best this year.

Both deserve to achieve some recognition from the Academy.Next, the writing. Goddamn it's on-point. The story and narrative is just beautiful yet heartbreaking. The dialogue written by Baumbach is just exceptional. Possibly the best aspect (next to the performances) is the directing. There are shots and sequences in this movie that were just perfect. The cinematography is of the highest level. There were several long takes in this movie and the characters had monologues and I was completely blown away.I don't see a flaw in this movie.

There are moments in the film that could be boring if not for the sheer presence of Adam driver and Scarlett Johansson. At no point are they acting, they're living the situation and that translates well into the audience. I wouldn't mind if both of the actors get a nod from the academy.The film has lengthy but limited number of scene. Every scene takes time to build up, they're driven by life-like conversation, so it takes time to arrive at the point. But when it arrives, it hits hard, cheers to the time taken to build it up.There's a lesson to be learned for up and coming writers, who are taught that you should enter the scene very late and exit as early as possible - there's a great reward for being patient.",

            "content": "This movie is proof that Hollywood still has something to say. That the 'traditional' filmmaking toolkit has still lot potential, that it is still able to touch hearts and move consciences without feeling cheap or boring or overdone.The story unfolds in a delicate yet intriguing way, and the deep dive into the psychology of the two main characters never feels voyeuristic or patronising. The two leading actors deliver very convincing performances, while the rest of the cast is way less convincing, unable to infuse any depth in their characters (which, to be honest, are a bit two-dimensional, possibly as a way to help the two main characters stand out even more).Two other weak points of the movie are to be found in an uninspired staging, set design and cinematography, as well as in the character of the son of the couple, not much in tune with the rest of the writing, and often feeling a bit off and stereotypical.Nonetheless, the writing is just gorgeous: the storytelling is nimble and spontaneous, as if someone were telling you the story of a couple they knew, sometimes indulging in details, sometimes going back and forth in the timeline, yet with great mastery and an open, compassionate heart.The subject is touching, and feels familiar to anyone who's ever loved and lost. It is stinging at times, soothing at others, but it never cheaply turns into a grotesque account for the sake of being interesting, because it simply doesn't need to.The subtle irony of the director permeates the whole movie, achieving a double goal: ensuring a minimal level of detachment to avoid seeming too pathetic, and disclosing the one deep truth that lies at the centre of this film. That love relies on the storytelling that each practices on themself.Being fully aware of it, we are always ready to change the story we tell ourselves on the inside, as a first step to change the external course of our lives.But as those redacted stories get on the outside, and as this case enter into the hands of lawyers, family and friends, we immediately recognise how dishonest and instrumental our recollection of the events was.And exactly the elusive relationship between a love story and its storytelling is indeed the untold, magnetic element connecting all the dots in this remarkable movie.",

Another minor criticism is that for me, the injection of two theatre songs from Stephen Sondheim were off. This is a film, not a play. The scenes work in the sense that the husband and wife playing them are a stage actress and a stage director in the story, fine, but they fall flat for me, perhaps underlining the difference between what is good on the stage and what is good on the screen. Theatre goers may love those scenes but they yanked me right out of the film. All in all, enjoyable but not nearly great.",

It impacted me in a way that i couldn't stop myself from penning my thoughts on this movie.It's a film that nicely depicts the emotional struggle of two individuals who fall head over heels in love for each other in the first place and get married,but then they can't find it in their hearts to get along with each other any more which leads their marriage to divorce. This movie reminded me of Sam Mendes's directorial \" Revolutionary Road \". A movie which is very dear to my heart. The reason why i resonate with that movie is because if you watch the films, you can tell that the mind space of the leading characters of both the two films are kind of same.Things that i really liked about \" Marriage Story \" are the facts that though the couple wants to end their dead-end relationship, they still have respect for each other, they still value each other's feelings. They may have their reasons for quitting their marriage,but that doesn't make them any less of a man or woman in each other's eyes. They may not have qualified to be a good spouse for each other, but they definitely want to be a doting parent for their child who's the only bridge in between them.The performances are Spectacular.I always knew that Scarlett Johansson is a great actress,but the one who took me by surprise was Adam Driver.He has given a standout performance in this film.Watch him in the climactic scene where his son asks him to read the letter that Nicole had written for him in the first place of their separation.That scene will steal your heart.In the end, ' Marriage Story ' is a movie that stands the perception of postdivorce lives of couples on its head. It's a must watch for everyone.",

It's usually a marriage, but occasionally it's the relationship of parent and child. I've often wondered who the films are for.Are they for the people who have experienced this kind of pain themselves to relive, knowing they aren't alone in the experience? Are they for people who have been blessed to never experience such pain who get a voyeuristic thrill (or maybe compassionate insight) into others' experience? Are folks just there for the acting?Watching MARRIAGE STORY, I am inclined to believe the answer is all and none of the above at the same time. This is a deeply painful and hard to watch story that for some may bring all I list above, but for others with the exact same backgrounds may prove triggering.It's important to know which you are before you start it, because this movie will take you on a very emotional and at times dark ride. If that's something that, when well written and acted, gives you pleasure or purpose as a viewer (I don't judge) then I recommend the movie. If it's something that reminds you of or could pull you into your own past pain, I think its ok to appreciate it from afar, but skip it. No one would blame you.",

            "review_title": "a Woody Allen Film not made by Woody Allen",
            "content": "A good divorce film provides enough suspense for all the audience, married or unmarried. Marriage Story not only keeps you hooked until the end to see how the story of two used-to-be love birds unfold, but also it is the lead actors, Scarlett Johansson and Adam Driver, taking your breath away. After all, it is more of a two-character study film rather than a plot-driven one.Inspired by director Noah Baumbach's personal divorce story from screen star Jennifer Leigh in 2013 and also his parents' , Marriage Story has artistic passion for expression flowing in its blood. Noah Baumbach had proved his mastery in Frances Ha; a film very much inspired by Woody Allen. Storytelling, dialogue, comedy yet melancholy feeling, and use of music is like Woody Allen's earlier films. He has borrowed elements of Woody Allen's cinema once again and added his own personal touch to it in Marriage Story. A story which laughs you out, makes you cry and puts you in the dilemma of which side to take; Nicole or Charlie. This very unbiased narrative is what makes Marriage Story truly distinct from other divorce films.Scarlett Johansson masterfully depicts Nicole, a one-time movie actor longing to get a name for herself and surpassing his successful Broadway director husband. She constantly speaks of Charlie's workaholism and inattention to her, one problem that is unfortunately more told rather than shown.Nicole's career arc and her transform from a mediocre theater actor to a director in Hollywood after the divorce, is the feminist theme of the film. Just like which side to take in terms of husband or wife, you are in the very dilemma of which actor performed on a greater level. Undisputedly, Marriage Story is the film that both Adam Driver and Scarlett Johansson have performed their career-best. Even better than Blackkklansman for Adam driver and Under The Skin for Scarlett Johansson. Charlie, played by Adam Driver, is the neat, ambitious and sweet husband every woman craves for.Unsurprisingly Nicole's family loves him. But even him ends up cheating his wife. After all, he is the thriving director in broadway, everyone wants to sleep with him. In the terrific fight sequence taking place in Charlie's apartment in LA, Charlie personally tells Nicole that he could've slept with any woman he wanted after his success but because of his loyalty to her, he did not.A loyalty he did not keep after having affairs with his production designer Marry Ann.\nWithout knowing what she is walking herself into, Nicole naively goes to the attorney her mother told her to, Nora, powerfully played by Laura Dern.She is the genuine representative of feminism. Nicole's action leaves dazzled Charlie no choice but to get himself an attorney; one that could bite as hard as Nora. At first Charlie meets the bulldog Jay (Ray Liotta, what a performance, so harsh that makes you smile), realizing Jay's methodology does not fit in his ethics, he goes to another lawyer. Bert is the opposite of what Jay is, as relaxed as one could be.Marriage Story's cinematography is beautiful. Robbie Ryan, who was also the cinematographer of gorgeous award-winning The Favorite, demonstrates his excellency yet again. The soft, simplistic image that you would expect from a realistic film, combined with warm and lively colors, makes you feel about the film the way it is intended to; sad-and-funny. Robbie Ryan manages to demonstrate the emotional position the two main sides are in using meticulous framing, how distant they are, and camera angle choices, how up or down they are. Let's not also forget that any film that is shot on film in the digital age deserves a special credit.Journey of Marriage Story ends not with character arc but 'letter arc'.A letter that was not read aloud is read aloud. Charlie's and Nicole's face clearly reveal that nothing will be the same after this journey. But is this change for the good or the worse?Marriage Story is not a film to be missed.",

Coming from parents who divorced but still loved each other was a very confusing thing for me to understand.

This movie truly made me understand my parents better, and truthfully, I don't think I can say a movie has ever affected me as much as this one. The acting was superb; Adam Driver depicting a man who realizes he messed up and is left to navigate life alone is just heartbreaking.

            "content": "\"Maarriage Story,\" written and directed by Noah Baumbach, stirs a lot of thoughts for audiences. It gives a realistic depiction of a youngish couple with a child going through divorce. Adam Driver plays the husband Charlie, a rising-star, theater director in New York, and Scarlett Johansson plays his wife Nicole, a talented actress in his plays. Laura Dern plays Nicole's tough L.A. divorce lawyer. Released by Netflix, the movie is billed as a drama/comedy, but there is no comedy in this film's sad, realistic portrayal of two decent persons' drifting apart, with one of them deciding to leave. After the separation, horrendous acrimony slowly builds until a final, emotional blow-up shatters everyone-the couple and the audience.Whose point of view tells this story? The man's or the woman's? Or, was the take-away for a man watching this film different from the take-away for a woman? Having thoroughly experienced the couple's feelings, I, a woman, left the theater wondering if a man had experienced the characters' heartbreak differently from me. I felt it must be so, for the film's point of view lacked clarity.I called a friend, a male and a millennial psychologist, and indeed his take-away was wholly different from mine. While I identified and sympathized with Nicole's stunted potential in a marriage where she served her rising-star husband, who loved her and their family life, but had no true interest in her \"being,\" who she was, as his passion and focus were totally on himself and his work and ambition. Everything else was rote for him and done according to the book of what was right and currently \"enlightened,\" such as how to be a good father, a considerate household partner, and a good, fair, and beloved director to his troupe.When, as happens in long marriages, Nicole lost interest in sex, Charlie found sex with the stage manager of his company. No, he didn't love her, he just needed that kind of intimacy and ego-gratification. He is god in his world. But the affair isn't why Nicole leaves. She leaves because at age 40ish, she realizes she isn't fulfilling her own life, her own gifts, her own passion, and she will never be able to if she stays with Charlie to serve his life and his success, which includes receiving a MacArthur grant for $600,000 to further advance his talent. Moreover, his new play is going to Broadway. His power and recognition are only going to keep growing while she stays as she is-his dependable wife, his actress in second place, his competent family partner, his solace and safety when home in the nest she provides.As in all marriages that begin in the mid-twenties, the partners evolve with time and their risk of not evolving together is high. Charlie and Nicole clearly love and care about each other, but the marriage is over for Nicole if she wants to live, if she wants an authentic, fulfilling life. She returns to her mother's home in L.A. when a pilot TV series offers her a role. She takes their son Henry along. It's not certain the show will take-off, so the trip is presented as short-term to see what happens. Once there, however, life feels so good to Nicole-her true identity is able to emerge, not only as an actress free from the shadow of her husband's greatness, but also as a future director herself, which is her dream. Henry also loves living in L.A. with Nicole's active, extended family life that includes cousins. The only problem is, Charlie's life is in New York, so that his career and ambition become bombed by Nicole's decision to remain in L.A. when the pilot succeeds. But it's not just the pilot that makes her stay. It's her good feelings about herself, about having a meaningful life, her right just as much as his. In L.A., she's not Charlie's appendage anymore, which was fine in her twenties when she worshiped him and came under his wing, but it's not fine now in her maturity. She has her own developed talent, equal to his when freed from its cage.My male friend's take-away was different. He saw Charlie as the victim of Nicole's manipulations. She left New York knowing her L.A. stint was going to be permanent. She tricked him, and now has the child legally in L.A. causing a custody suit. Her character was shallow while his was deep. Not only that, but Adam Driver was a far better actor than Scarlett Johansson. And Nora, the aggressive L.A. lawyer, was creepy, hideous-he shuddered just remembering her.I want to pause here and say that Nora, portrayed as L.A.'s toughest, man-gouging divorce lawyer for women, also affected me as a female viewer. She's groomed pejoratively: slinky, skin-revealing clothes , long blond hair incongruous with her aging face, and a fake way of communicating with her new client, all saccharine in order to win her business. Why was Nora presented this way? Perhaps to mock L.A./Hollywood culture when it comes to divorce, for Charlie's L.A. male lawyer is even worse. These characters are driven by money and how much you can get from your future ex-spouse; no concern for damage done to children and the parents in such an antagonistic, bitter, and volatile tug of war. It's crass and tragic.But there's more to consider. Everything that spouts from Nora's smart, fighter lips about the double standard is true. Who is listening to her? Perhaps some members of the female audience. I heard her and as a result, overlooked her unappealing traits because she spoke the truth about male-female relationships and how society condones men and condemns women in the same situation. My male friend couldn't tolerate her, and because of her money-grasping and exterior traits, he felt even more that Nicole was a conniving manipulator and Charlie a victim. Again, the film's point of view comes up. Was everything Nicole said to Charlie about her deepest feelings and why she was leaving, and Nora's pronouncements about the double standard, part of the script for the truth they told or part of the script to mock women in favor of Charlie the battered hero?It would be interesting to set up a poll to compare the male and female responses to this movie-and I welcome hearing from you. The film ends nicely, because Nicole and Charlie are able to go back to their original, honest and caring roots and dump the lawyers in their divorce. And Charlie accepts the reality that Nicole is not coming back and figures out a way to make fruitful changes in his professional life in order to be near his son. But what is the film's point of view about that, about Charlie making changes to accommodate the divorce? My point of view is: good solution. My friend's point of view might be: she forced him to wreck his career, give up his New York life and passion. Nora the lawyer might say: This film perpetuates the way society has always viewed women as demons; it upholds the superior integrity and value of men. And the film? We don't leave the theater knowing the film's point of view, but my closest guess is: Charlie's beleaguered treatment deserves our support. Hopefully it's a wrong guess.",

The basis of the story may be one that we have all heard before, but though it comes across and is executed well, something still lacks in the deep end. There is too much of the same repetitive nature in the film as one feels as if they are watching the same scenes over and over as the mood does not seem to change all too well and the story does not stray far off from its course. There is nothing special about this film; there is no reason why anyone should voluntarily watch this film as the only reason it has such raves is because of its two headline actors.",

It is a heavy hitter, and not for everyone. You definitely do need to be in the right mood to properly enjoy this one.Without revealing too much I will just say that Adam Driver was fantastic. The guy can flat out act and Scarlett Johansson went to another level giving us an enthralling performance. Watching these two play off each other for two hours was a thing of cinematic beauty. Laura Dern's Oscar winning role was strong, as was Ray Liotta's lesser talked about turn as a lawyer.Marriage Story will reel you in, churn you up and spit you back out. It's emotionally draining, and I mean that as a compliment in its highest form. It's a lesson in film making and story telling that others should take note of.Marriage Story works on every level.

            "content": "This is a pretty mediocre movie about a less than interesting divorce. As is often the case when the director is also the writer, this movie suffers from a weak script and a dearth of strong tweaking. For a film about marriage - or is it about divorce - Marriage Story has little to say and offers little insight into marriages or troubled relationships. Scenes play out as if it is fascinating for the director watching behind the camera, but for the audience many scenes just seem to go on too long, or peter out, or need to be pumped up. Surely the biggest problem with the movie is that the motivation for this particular 'drama' is unclear. Here we have a youngish couple with a child, both with careers in the same business, who seem to be at a crisis in their marriage. But how we got there and the magnitude of that crisis is unclear and remains vague throughout the film. We see one stab at counselling and then bang it's off to melodrama-movie-style-divorce. For all the naturalness that is attempted here the behaviour and situations these folks find themselves in - and their subsequent behaviours - seem quite fake and unreal. Again this problem is due to a contrived script. The child custody element of this story (shades of Kramer v.s. Kramer) also doesn't work very well because at the heart of it is an immature, spoiled, selfish, neurotic and irritating child who seriously needs a firm hand and a haircut. And whereas the actors seem game, the scenes with the child actor feel stiff and constrained. The adult actors do a great job from Ray Liotta and Laura Dern and Alan Alda as the lawyers to Adam Driver as the husband. But Marriage Story really belongs to Scarlett Johansson who yells, laughs, cries, wipes away tears and basically owns this movie what there is of it.",

That instantly meme-worthy scene that took the internet by storm as soon as this puppy hit Netflix: wow. I mistakenly watched that and just that, and in comparison to the understated, well-edited trailers, it was an assault. It seemed as if there was no way the film could find itself there, or worse: was that, could that be the tonal emotional mean? Thankfully, it is not. At all. And, though that scene mostly doesn't work, it doesn't feel *so* out of place that the viewer is pulled out of the story. This is a film about tension, and the majority of that tension is unseen or implied. There's a lot of passive aggressiveness on display in place, and that felt real.This is low 9 out of 10 in my opinion. I don't think it's Baumbach's best, but it's at least his best since 2013's Frances Ha. (Quick ranking of Baumbach: #1 Squid #2 Frances #3 Greenburg #4? Probably this)",

The parents are borderline abusive towards their son, who is used here as a prop whom they can haggle over. The farcical scene leading towards Charles being served was cringe-inducing and overly long (since when does an old lady leap into the arms of her daughter's husband? Yes, I know wine was involved but everyone in the room acted like it was Tuesday). If Nicole stopped mid-way through explaining her story to her attorney to exclaim about how yummy the refreshments were one more time, I was going to throw something at the screen. Stop it, just stop it. Only crazy people act like that. Nicole is bratty, whiny and a couple sandwiches short of a picnic. Charlie is hang dog, wooden, stoic and largely unpleasant. I don't want to spend 5 minutes with these people let alone 2 hours! The only thing I can think of that would explain why film critics are raving is the cast of luminaries & the self-referential Hollywood/TV production sub plot.

But this one... it takes you to that moment as if that moment is happening right now. As if the destinies of the characters are not already settled.And with each moment it gives you something new to think about. Eventually, if you are lucky, you start to see yourself in that situation. And cinema that gives clarity to people is art.This is art. A little piece of powerful cinema. I not only like Marriage Story, I respect it. I respect what they decided to do, and how successful they were. A tough story to put on your shoulders, but Noah Baumbach and co. couldn't get better results.With this movie, Netflix was able to show that they can provide.

I've never been married (and as such never divorced either), I don't have any kids and most of my imidiate family are still in their first marriages, including my paretns and grandparents. Still I know several firends who's parents are divorced, as well as some of my firends and some coussins, so I'm not virgin to the subject. Still, while I'm sure they all had their problems that they had to deal with (hence the divorce), I don''t know anyone who dragged lawyers into it or had to fight battles over custody of the kids or alomony and the like. Outwardly it all seems pretty smooth. It's either \"Ok, we'll keep living close to eachother and as long as we are both clean and decent parents we split 50/50 whenever possible, and we each pay for the time the kid spends with us, not more, not less\", or it's \"We won't live close to eachother anymore, so let's decide one palce were the kids go to school and the other can see them on alternate weekends and longer periods over school breaks, in which case we'll work something out for how much the kids clothes and school material and toys etc. costs and split it\". Maybe it's a cultural thing, since I live in Sweden, or maybe american movies/tv-shows just like to focus on the worst aspects of humanity and extream bad cases of divorce, or maybe everyone who I know who has been through one was just lucky exceptions, but this whole paying 100's of 1000's of dollars to bring in lawyers to sit in a room shouting at each other, not giving room for any acctual conversation to happen seems so surreal and unneccessary that I just can't find this movie very appealing. The court room scenes was also my least favorite parts of Kramer vs. Kramer, but at least that movie was maily about a father and son bonding, which still made it an overall positive experience.",

The layer was the only one character in the movie who played on the family, basically destroying it, and of course, got a nice profit.3. I would understand Nicole's unhappy live with her husband if he hadn't care about her, but he basically made her a Star. She reached her dream, and only then decided to divorce him when she doesn't need him anymore.4. During the whole movie we see how Chris was pushed. Is he such a bad man? He cheated, but this wasn't the main point the movie was trying to emphasize. Should we (the women) now divorce every time the men don't listen to us, to what we want without any explanation?5.

All they shouted was not about what they DID and want to GET from each other (except Chris's cheated), but how they ARE bad for each other. The movie teaches well how to break any relationships and at the same time it says - \"So we shouldn't even try to listen to each other.\"The moral part of the movie stays pathetic. The family was ruined because Nicole managed to tell her problem only to the lawyer. Yes, she's got what she wanted, but was she happy after?

While the acting is great by both Adam Driver and Johanssen, the bickering becomes overbearingly long-winded - as if a fun guest had over-stayed their welcome by making their host listen to the same joke and the only difference being how they lead into the joke... In the end, I feel the only things great are snippets of the two leads performance, and almost all the scenes with Alda, Liotta, and Dern, made me wanting more.This could have been a great bittersweet comedy about being in love while you cannot even like each other enough to break bread without fighting over small things like how to squeeze a tube of toothpaste. I can only blame the script and the director for this oversight. While the improv singing and end scene allowed Adam Driver to shine, this would have been a better story for Woody Allen or Whit Stillman to tell... in fact, probably Rob Reiner also would have made this better than the overrated flick it is.As to Best Actress performances for 2019, I'd say this one holds no candle at all compared to Renee zellweger in JUDY (2019), but I digress...",

            "content": "I had high hopes for this film after all the wild acclaim, but for me, it didn't live up to the hype. Yes, the acting by Scarlett and Adam was excellent. And I loved Adam's character's poignant and unexpected nightclub performance of the Sondheim song. Although a modest attempt was made to show two well-intentioned, but humanly flawed, parents dissolving their marriage while trying to keep things stable for the son they both love fiercely, the scales tip heavily toward making the wife into the \"bad guy\" (albeit with some redeeming hug-and-haircut empathy) and showing the husband as the occasionally foul-mouthed and ill-tempered one who really got the shaft. Notwithstanding any parallels to the screenwriter/director's real-life divorce, the film comes off as a husband's attempt to be oh-so-sorry for the mess in everyone's lives that he thinks started when his wife left him. It's as if his feelings of loss, loneliness, anger, and downright inconvenience are all her fault for just not understanding who he is (or how important his job is) and who he thought they were as a couple. As she asserts herself as a person separate from him and his goals for himself (and her), she becomes the film's antagonist. How unfortunate that this marriage story fails to recognize, as most people do, that when a marriage ends (and neither one is seriously mentally ill), there are multiple factors at play involving both parties. Placing the blame heavily on one over the other, with no substantial character change by the film's end, does little to enlighten us on the subject.",

            "content": "I really enjoyed this. It hit home hard as well as my parents both got divorced; amicably, when I was a teenager.Therefore I can relate to the many difficulties of a love-hate relationship and it being really under such huge strain when they no longer love each other.The acting is epic. Adam Driver switches on character modes in the blink-of-an-eye. From being super-aggressive douche to kind; emphatic and caring and then a withering mess. It must have been a really emotional movie to shoot.Scarlett Johansson is also a powerhouse. Excellent narrative. Script is superb. Lots of emotional acting. No action or CGI and stuff so if you want that it's not for you. It's just a straight-up epic drama playing out a couple's torn relationship and seeking bitter sweet compromise.It's shot wonderfully. I love the way you feel that you're in the room with them. The support cast is excellent; particularly Ray Liotta; Alan Alda; Wallace Shawn. Julia Greer and some powerhouse exchanges from Laura Dern at either Ray Liotta or Adam Driver. Wow.It's so refreshing as it's not at all a cheesy Hollywood romance script even though it's set there and it could 100% so much have been that.The depth and how accurate it is is bloody scary and 100% realistic. It's especially emotional for people who experienced divorce at a young age.Acting is incredible. Script is superb. The casting is another level. The freshness is there and it's not a full-blown clich\u00e9 drama but real and authentic.The last few scenes are incredibly emotional and he realises what's important. It's really humbling and refreshing. Thank you to the producers for making this film as so many marriages fail and dialogue needs to happen for understanding of each other.Excellent work. 9/10.",

Although this wasn't his best performance, not even close, I do feel like he played a grounded role-a catalyst to the plot. However, the rest of the acting, in my opinion was simply atrocious. Scarlet Johansson had her moments within scenes where I felt she had shined but for the most part, I felt a disconnect to her character and never felt like her emotion successfully penetrated anyone. As for the rest of the cast, I was shocked at how corny and pretentious everyone was.I don't know if this was caused from a faulty script or just poor acting entirely, but quite frankly, i was highly disappointed. The lawyer sought out by driver towards the beginning was the biggest cliche of the entire film. Tacky, rude, and extremely over the top. Don't even get me started on Julie Hagerty's performance.What a let down for such a well selected cast. I found a more meaningful side story of a repaired marriage in Jon Favreau's Chef.",

            "content": "Can you make, in this day and age, a movie about a man and a woman and nothing else? Can you present the old battle between Los Angeles and New York in a new light and a have a 'neurotic' auteur male protagonist with his blonde muse appear fresh, more than 40 years after Woody Allen (and his master, Bergman)?\nCan you drawn out for well more than two hours what in the end is just a dramatic comedy (the only flaw I would ascribe to an otherwise unmitigated triumph) and not only get away with it but pull from under your hat a career defining masterpiece not just for you but for your two leading actors (hell, three if we count Ray Liotta, and I'm gonna! I'd consider even Alan Alda to have been blessed by this movie if his career wasn't already legendary, although, besides Horace and Pete, this may be his only work really worthy of notice in the last 20 years)?\nWell, turns out if your name is Baumbach you can do whatever the hell you want, and then some!\nI've long appreciated this underknown master crafter of movies, although his last collaboration with Ben Stiller (and adam driver, who i only got to like in this movie!) left me somewhat cold. But it appears that since he took the Netflix way, UNLIKE some better known big shot director, he is regaling us with his best work since The squid and the whale, well into his fifties (I imagine...).\nAside from a couple of 'musical' numbers that seemed a concession to his stars and aggravated the already vexing screen time, the only other small blemish I could find in an otherwise perfect script would be that, despite a very conscious effort to present a very balanced, UN-kramer like scenario, in which both the man and the woman are very good parents and essentially good people who only want the best for each other, but still, against their better judgement, end up making each other miserable, the movie still seems to me to favor the woman in the end, if only slightly (55-45 let's say).\nThat may also be the reason why Scarlett Johansson is generally considered to have given the best performance, even though it seems to me the most dramatic scenes were given to Driver. That may also have to do with something cognitivists call the frame problem: while Adam Driver has almost esclusively appeared in artsy dramas, Johansson can be considered a somewhat bogged down version of the very character she plays, an actress known for a commercial movie in which she shows her boobs.\nFunnily enough, the only nude the real Scarlett ever did was in an artsy scandinavian film that nobody saw (aside from the salient ten seconds...), but aside from that she may have given the best actorial proof in her career just because she never challenged herself all that much, not because she suddenly channeled Liv Ullman like many seem to think.\nDriver, on the other hand, doesn't do here anything he hadn't already done in the past, beside being likable (no small feat for him! kudos to Baumbach once more).\nAll the rest of the cast is in a state of grace as well, from Laura Dern to the already mentioned Ray Liotta and Alan Alda as the combative lawyers of the protagonists. I may have chosen famous names for other roles as well, namely Nicole's mother and sister, instead of casting Wallace Shawn in a pretty forgettable and useless character.",

It's at times great, but it doesn't work for me on many levels.As someone who is going through a divorce myself, I just can't identify at all with Nicole. From the very beginning her grounds for divorce seems incredibly flimsy. Do a couple who are clearly still in love with each other decide to end it for the reasons given in the film? I can see why so many are labelling them as hipsters. Well... And Charlie at the end of the film wants to move to LA. Well... Are we supposed to sympathise?As for the plot, there are just too many similarities to Synecdoche, New York. So the wife has decided to move to a far away place, and taking the child whom the husband fears he will never see. Then the husband is a theatre director who got a MacArthur grant, and is the love interest of a \"lesser\" female member of the theatre crew. And then a condescending female professional (lawyer / therapist) provides comedy relief. I mean, am I supposed to immerse myself in the plot when I am counting similarities of this plot with another plot?And then there's more. So Nicole is an actress turned successful female director. How wonderful, guess who that reminds me of? I really hope Gerwig wouldn't mind getting written into a divorce drama while Baumbach is still with her. I am hoping Scarlett Johansson is not going to be the big screen witness to another director couple divorce (well she's technically not on big screen in Her but hey).So you see, there are just too many elements stopping me emotionally investing in the characters. Critics love it for the in-jokes, maybe. But to be honest these in-jokes are just plain annoying and pointless.I like films with a stage play feel when it's done right. Marriage Story has good rhythm and excellent performances but I feel the wit is missing. Adam Driver and Scarlett Johansson have both probably done their career best here. Ray Liotta and Laura Dern are both totally enjoyable. The intense dialogues and monologues are definitely great but they are just soooooo obviously vehicles for \"outstanding performance of a lead role in drama\".To be honest, I doubt people will remember Marriage Story in 10 years. Maybe drama students will. As this film feels incredibly like a drama class exercise.",

It was fun to see the court room exchange between Liotta and Dern.Also okay was the war of words at Adam's apartment between Adam and Scarlett. That was some acting that I enjoyed.Scarlett was cute while dancing and singing with her mom and sister, telling us that her return to LA was going full steam ahead.In addition, some lines were fantastic like \"I need my own a**hole.\" Or this one:\"The thought of having sex with you makes me want to peel my skin off\"hahahaBut that was it. Nothing else there fore meDivorces are all painful. then a movie about a divorce you can imagine what you will get for your buck.Unless you love divorces and drama and tears and devastation and the breaking of a marriage, its likely you'd leave the cinema quiet, silent and wanting someone to cheer you.I guess, some people love drama and tears. Others like entertaining feeling-good flicks. I belong to the second group. Did not enjoy Marriage Story.But don't get me wrong, I love the actors and love their work and their nominations are well deserved.

Maybe without lawyers they could have being arguing for years, but she didn't even try.Also it shows how lawyers have to exagerate everything and are greedy.I like how it touched the idea that in the divorce they both should be equals, but the sistem says otherwise.To me is a 6, it wasn't that entretaining and logn\nI can see why peolpe may love thos movie, but personally and fortunately I didn't felt identified.",

Gotta watch it...he's so bloody good. The director and the movie picks up all the nuances of a failing marriage...well almost. The dialogue is so real that you start imagining yourself there ( you will know what I mean , if you're married). Two successful people but flawed parents, yet basking in the unblemished love of an adorable child. Sensitive portrayal of the central characters keep you engrossed. The only flaw is the sanitization of the mess a divorce creates. The protagonists are seemingly well-off , so , howmuchsoever they talk about the expenses and the fallout , the pain doesn't cut deep.

You would want to pick sides, but you won't be able to. That's the beauty of this movie. Unlike Kramer vs Kramer, where you clearly are rooting for Ted, or in A Separation, where you empathise with what Simin is going through, Marriage Story will leave you pondering about the reality of the separation.Adam Driver and Scarlett deserve Oscar nods for their performances, and I believe Noah deserves an Oscar for the screenplay.I am a fan of Noah's work, but this is his masterpiece.It's a movie made for mature audience.

Maybe because she was going through a divorce while making this movie.I believe it was a story of two people that would never get together but ended up for years in a marriage because of their kid. Many women will be able to relate to Johansson character because she abandoned herself to be a presence for her husband and son. Both, in my opinion were portrayed as self-fish and immature people. It was not a love story like many people said. I couldn't see love in their relationship, but I saw commitment from her part to the relationship and steadiness from his part. They loved their kid, but they didn't loved the time they spent together, they respected and cared for each other almost in a fraternal way (the ending scene proves my point). They grown up together, not as a couple but as a result of their divorce.I was separating from my husband when I watched the movie and I thought this will be really sad. But no.

I was Henry in this movie, but my story was a bit sadder than his. I feel so bad for the kids having to experience this kind of pain; seeing two people you love fall out of love with each other is heartbreaking. My parents fought in front of us; it was such a traumatizing experience that even my sister doesn't remember it. I'm glad that Charlie and Nicole didn't fight in front of Henry. This was one of the few movies that I cried at and could relate to. I'm probably never going to watch this again, but I'm glad I did.",

            "content": "Marriage Story delivers a very simple premise in a very simple way. Therefore, it can only be effective in its performances, particularly Adam Driver's. The story focuses on divorce; how the process affects those who'd once loved each other, emotionally. Lesser movies, like Billy Crystal's Forget Paris (1992) have a more interesting narrative to go along with this focus, and are more colourful in their approach. Marriage Story doesn't justify itself as anything more than a chance to pick up some accolades during awards season.I commend the film's setting of 2019, as fewer directors today opt to set their films in the contemporary time period. The overall colours and look of the film (aspect ratio, palette) are fine, although the piece would benefit from a few more establishing shots of New York City, again linking back to this idea of the contemporary. Show One World Trade Center just like older movies flaunted the Twin Towers for instance, staples of New York City during different eras. There's just plenty of interior settings here, it all started to feel drab after awhile.I often got distracted by Scarlett Johansson's obvious Oscar-Bait performance, while Adam Driver is always more grounded. Laura Dern is intentionally unlikeable as the lawyer, while Ray Liotta could've had a few more scenes to improve his character. Neither of them deliver anything really impressive, despite being impressive actors.The child, Henry, is an insufferable, annoying and exceedingly unlikeable presence in the movie. Why? I sincerely hope this wasn't intentional, as the major drive of the story is Adam and Scarlett trying to figure out what's best for him. It's revealed that he's eight years old, yet he acts much younger. Which eight year old can't read the word 'time'? Was it an attempt at realism, given the fact that it's 2019? Maybe the writer and director of this film, Noah Baumbach, just doesn't \"get\" children. What he's directed here, is an occasionally moving but ultimately uninspired film, whose story is lead solely on the shoulders of two very good performances. That's it.",

I really don't get what makes these ordinary characters so special.Scarlett always has a similar level of volume to her voice and barely strays from it and rarely, if ever, changes expressions to make me think, \"wow, she's really embodies this character\". When she does, it's one note. I don't get why kids need to curse in these movies. It's not funny and it's a bit weird how parents in these movies just let their kids freely use adult language so young or use such language towards their kids like that. Can't relate.Adam was good, but it felt like his talents were wasted. The best moments were when he could actually use his emotions and you could see it on his face. Otherwise, I liked him way better in \"Paterson\".Laura Dern, again, talents wasted. She played a lawyer.....okay? Her character was not special in any way. I've seen this type of character before. I don't think her performance for this movie was award worthy. She's played better characters where she actually should have gotten an award for.This movie just did not \"wow\" me.

            "content": "I was really moved by this film. The soundtrack by Randy Newman really evokes a feeling of nostalgia and memories which really help bring out the tears during the movie, much like his soundtracks to the Toy Story films. And the tracks really compliment each scene, I noticed especially during the ending, which is where I finally cried. This is also thanks to an incredible performance from Adam Driver who really gives it his all here and despite his character not being a perfect person, you really do genuinely care about him and during some of the later scenes, his emotions start to properly come out and that's when I began to cry. The cinematography is also extremely well done and there are a lot of shots that symbolically divide the two leads and it subconsciously gives a feeling of sadness. It's shot very still and unmoving in a good way and it helps set the tone and pace of the film, which is slow yet extremely emotionally impactful, especially in the latter areas of the movie. It's just a really solid, unique and compassionate look into the real struggles of a divorce and throughout the whole film, you feel bad for both sides of the party for different reasons. And when the movie comes to a close and the two finalise the split while still maintaining a stable family life with their son, you feel a sense of melancholy relief. The letter reading scene at the end was honestly in my top 10 movie scenes of the year it was that damn touching. I think this was the right film for me to watch especially with me feeling really down recently, and it's a flick with lots of heart, solid writing, incredible acting, a stellar soundtrack and a real punch to the heart. If you're interested, watch it. It's truly one of the best of last year. Well done Noah Baumbach.",

However divorcing is ugly, marriage is not that bad.\nIt seems the reason for divorce is about Nicole wants to live in LA, while Charlie wants to live in NY, but at the end, Charlie found a job in LA.\nI always thought marriage is about being together, but it seems the two characters don't want marriage at all.",

With his role as father being influenced purely out of love for his child and his work as a director being his outlet for control. On the other hand it was nice to watch scarlet Johnson actually use all her depth for once instead of a patriarchal Hollywood avengers film where she's there for her looks and not much else. Her ability to display how damaged she was by the breakup was breathtaking as she was able to manipulate us into feeling bad for both her and adam. Overall I really loved this film from the great acting to stunning cinematography which I think is some of the best I've seen this year, the score being beautiful and with the use of motifs recurring which evoked emotion for me as it displayed there relationship at its best moments and what's they'd lost.",

Because of some flimsy stubborn competitiveness established in the beginning? I'm not buying it. And even so, that just makes me loathe these characters. It even goes so far as to lay on a disingenuous feminist element that is completely off base & laughable for no other reason I can imagine than that Baumbach wanted pander to the current political climate. Laura Dern's spiel on women's disadvantages in society do not apply to the court system when deliberating custody. Conversely, it's the man rather who's dealt the disadvantage in this case(Driver even had to pay for a third of Scarlett's legal costs!). The woman is favored in such a circumstance for a reason the Liotta character explicitly brought up earlier on in the film. So, now the film contradicts itself too...\n.\nI can 't speak for others(clearly to some out there there's resonance here), but as a child who has virtually known divorce all his life, who cannot even remember when his parents were ever together, I could not get over how phony this all felt. As a human being I could not get over how infuriating this all felt(& not the way it was intended). Unfortunately, not even the acting could redeem it for me in any way. In fact, the acting was so good at times that my disgust for the characters would momentarily slip off onto the actors. I found this to be just a bunch of noise & emotions around nothing, wherein they waste their money & potential on divorce proceedings that neither one of them wanted, but sustained anyways out of a sick power game; meanwhile, the world's got real problems going on...In other words, there is no real problem here. Just middle-upper class, self-indulgent, first-world idiots with maniacal egos stirring one up & then acting like nothing happened because Driver needs his shoe tied...If Baumbach needs a solid story to film he should consider reading some novels & optioning something because clearly he is just forcing something here out of what may be a drought of anything more substantial to say. It's a movie about people who have the resources to be relatively happy, but who create a problem for themselves & come out the other end with nothing--like nothing at all had happened. It's empty. Nobody likes a straw man argument. Well, ladies & gentleman, this is nothing more than a straw man story...",

Before all hell breaks lose, each character is doing its best to end things amicably for the benefit of their child, but forced out of their control evolve and quickly hasten the dissolution of any mediation or consensus over various outcomes for each party. It's certainly a good movie, perhaps if for nothing else, allowing the audience to peer into the lives of two opposing sides to a divorce, having no preconceived notions or judgments, the ending is one at the very least of empathy for each individual party. It's merit rests on the relatability of its characters and its universal theme: navigating the hardships underlining marriage and divorce.",

Instead, I found the movie unsatisfying and somewhat boring, actually. I did not feel that the flame war between the divorcing couple (and between their attorneys!) was either compelling or realistic, but was annoying and repetitive.. The acting was competent, but a bit over the top for my taste.\nThe premise: couple still has affection for each other, but there's too much baggage, so they have to separate. They are both intelligent, so it's unbelievable that the wife wouldn't have communicated her dissastisfaction long before, and also that the husband would be so clueless as not to notice there were issues.\nThey are both overly consumed with getting custody of their son - it's their only important goal apparently. In the real world this could have been worked out as a joint custody agreement, regardless of where the parents chose to live. The first half of the movie seemed brilliant, then it dropped the ball. Nasty fight between the couple, and between their attorneys. The guy caves in; gives up his career and moves to LA because his ex-wife wants it. She is an insufferable whiner. And a corny ending of their son finally learning to read at the age of 8 - what, he's a dyslexic? And what does he read? The blurb from the beginning of the movie where the wife wrote down all the things she loved about her \"soon to be ex\" husband. How cute? NOT. A cheap and cheesy cop-out ending.",

It tells two painful things respectively: when a person has stopped expecting all the time, what she pursues has been achieved unexpectedly, and when a person finally learns to sacrifice himself for her, the person he wants to sacrifice for has gone. The movie gradually reveals the spiritual world of both parties in the conversation over and over again. How much concession the woman has in the marriage is how vicious it is in the divorce, and how selfish the man is in the marriage is how overwhelmed he is in the divorce. By the end, no matter which side of the audience is more inclined to divorce, they will not feel that the other side is making trouble or even empathizing with the other side.",

To some extent, this \"marriage story of two American cities\" is universal, and with the change of the times, it has a lot of new practical significance than Bergman's \"marriage life\" and other works. The performance is really praiseworthy, especially in the quarrel section. The audience seems to ride on a roller coaster with the two actors, pushing their emotions to the highest point, then falling violently, and even collapsing and sad with them. This requires a strong appeal. If there is a chance, this story is very suitable to be adapted into a stage play, and the dramatic tension will be stronger.

At times we achieve catharsis, but in any case we always expect the filmmaker to have something new and interesting to say. Baumbach could have given us a new perspective on divorce or engaged us emotionally, especially given his personal experience, but he failed to dig deep enough.\nThe problem is that in trying to be somehow objective and presenting the story from both perspectives he fails to explore the inner workings of either character. We see what is happening to them but we cannot feel it. It's like listening to a guy you just met in a pub talking about his devastated love life. You can feel sorry for him, but after a while you just want to get back to your business. The most obvious comparison, Kramer vs Kramer was a bit of a melodrama, but it had something new to say, as it was questioning traditional parental roles. Bergman's Scenes from a Marriage gave us a precise dissection of the ego of its two protagonists and showed us new depths of human psyche. The war of the Roses was as far fetched as it was hilarious, but represented a cautionary tale for all those who do not choose to split up amicably. What did marriage story give us after two and a half long long hours?\nWe find out that divorcing is not pleasant and that divorce lawyers say nasty things.\nThe only reason we end up feeling sorry for the couple is that because of their expensive lawyers they are going broke. They are supposed to fight for their kid's custody, but we never really feel their love for the kid. We have to believe that they care because that's what's parents do, but from what I see I don't understand why adam driver simply didn't go back to his life in New York.\nAs per the acting, to me it looks like good but not outstanding improvisation. Adam driver could pull convincing facial expressions, but he seems to have lost his charm, while Scarlett Johansson tries so hard to deliver her monologues in an oscar worthy fashion but looks like she's acting all the time.\nI really don't understand Hollywood's obsession with Baumbach and his partner Greta Gerwig. I find them so dull and boring.\nMaybe you have to be a millennial to get their movies.",

There are moments that are genuinely heartbreaking (scenes with a dramatic cat calling argument and a song evoking a realisation come to mind). It also highlights how an amicable ending to a relationship can be turned into an even more painful process by lawyers who pretend to care. As with all Noel Baumbach movies, you are in for a rollercoaster of emotions and sometimes question whether you should be laughing or crying. He also creates a story where you don't take sides and simply feel enormous empathy for each party.This movie will rip you apart and yet give you a smudge of hope that life can continue.",

You feel the emotions as the characters feel their emotions, all while never siding with either character. You feel like the child of a divorce being dragged from one side to the other, not knowing who to sympathise with and who your allegiance is drawn towards. This of course comes down to Baumbach's trademark realistic dialogue, and the performances of Adam Driver and Scarlett Johanson - they are both wonderfully superb!

I found the story of the movie pretty boring. The decisions the characters took didn't make a lot of sense at times and given that this movie tries to be realistic this bothered me. For me the characters also weren't very interesting and their story wasn't anything special. I was expecting a tragical love story, but what I got was mostly an long court battle of two people who started disliking each other more and more, which in (just a little more) ration world wouldn't happen like this.",

And the dialogue is so good in not really be able to go anywhere more specific. And the acting performed by S. Johansson and A. Driver is truly terrific and what really matters.

            "content": "If you would read no further than this line: this is a beautiful film and you should see it.Noah Baumbach has taken the same ingredients he used for his last film, The Meyerowitz Stories, and has balanced them with more skill, leading to a picture that shines on all fronts .We observe the main characters, Charlie and Nicole, as they go through the motions of their divorce. We watch them struggle with their desires while they try to frame everything leading up to the separation - meanwhile going through all the emotions that bubble to the surface. They have a young child, Henry. Their relationship with him as they go through the break up is redefined, as the parents labor to keep their difficulties out of his world as much as possible. From the film's opening on you are invested in these people and that doesn't change until the end credits are rolling.Adam Driver and Scarlet Johansson are just lovely. I mean, I don't know what else to say. These are two top of the line actors portraying well written characters in a heartfelt story. What's not to like? They make you feel deeply for Charlie and Nicole - their confusion, despair, frustration, doubt and hope, come across as believable and genuine. There will be moments in the film where you will feel their pain, and laugh at their silliness as they try to keep their heads above water.The rest of the cast is a perfect fit, with Laura Dern, Alan Alda and Ray Liotta being particularly good as the divorce lawyers. I won't say too much about their characters or performances as not to spoil the film, but let's just say they represent that side of human nature we would rather avoid having to acknowledge.Baumbach's unique writing style delivers a mix of clever, engaging and sometimes hilarious dialogue and a story that makes the character's feel very real and relatable.This film is a great reminder that right and wrong, in their absolute fairytale forms, don't exist. People endeavor to love and often times they eventually fail. And while that's okay, the suffering that comes with it is inevitable. This picture does well in showing what that means on an existential front as wel as displaying the harsh pragmatical and logistical side of things that comes with a divorce when there's a kid in the picture, without giving us any easy, pre-made conclusions to hold on to.",

The film was. Oh but that's not all...First, there are so many stylistic choices that the director/writers made such as overlapping of voices in tense moments, tempo of action, and an overall mesmerizing choreography, (especially during a scene based around a film set) that make subconscious emotions flood into any viewers head. I loved it.Second, framing by the cinematographer is excellent even when it breaks rules. In fact, especially when it breaks rules. There is a monologue that goes on for minutes, (feels like hours) where, as the dialogue progresses, the camera gets tighter and tighter on the subjects face. Not only does this highlight the emotion of the scene but draws the viewer in and makes them feel the \"trapped\" perspective of the helpless character. Another particularly beautiful idea was to stick 2 characters in the corner of a room and use the walls to guide the viewers perspective all the way into the corner. Normally this would be a no-no, especially because one of the characters bodies is turned to the camera, however again this illustrates the characters metaphorical position in life, he/she is being backed into a corner and their fate is unclear. Absolutely brilliant!Here's why it's not a 10/10. A. I'm biased against sad movies, sorry I just am. B. There are several lines delivered by an otherwise Oscar-worthy performance by Adam Driver that feel like he didn't even try to deliver them. They fell so flat and ruined some scenes credibility. It made me remember I was watching a movie, (not good).All in all it was a phenomenal experience and I feel like a better person after having viewed it, it puts a lot of things into perspective. This movie is centralized around divorce and I'm fortunate enough to not have had people close to me experience it (yet). Having said that it made me feel a ton of emotions and if it can do that for me, I'm sure it can for you!",

The acting was fine but the writing was lazy. He is the only one who we really get to know, so she naturally comes across as a superficial evil coward.

Apart for the long list of cliches, I think Marriage Story does a great injustice to children. In a divorce, the children are always the ones paying for their parents choices, they are always missing the happy family, they care for their parents and always blaming themselves for the separation. The films fails to show any real emotion of the child, as the authors were trying to feel divorced parents feel good about their children.The only real thing to me were the actors playing the lawyers: Laura Dern, Ray Liotta and Alan Alda. All three had excellent performances, that were not wasted by the script as it happened with the two main characters. The impact of the formal approach on divorcing people's feelings and actions is the only area were this film comes close to A Separation, excepting the unrealistic lack of resentment for the terrible things done to each other by the main characters. But who can complain about realism from a film where the parents have still plenty of energy and time to spend with the child after buying two new houses in LA, without selling the old one from NY, paying the top lawyers and a lot of travel between the west coast and east coast, all while also being successful at work?So, if you want feeling and a film that deserved its Oscar, watch A Separation. If you don't want the effort to think and to read subtitles, then watch this as at least the acting is better than a telenovela, but don't expect a better script.",

Instead, I found the movie unsatisfying and somewhat boring, actually. I did not feel that the flame war between the divorcing couple (and between their attorneys!) was either compelling or realistic, more annoying and repetitive than anything else. The acting was competent, but a bit over the top for my taste.\nThe premise: couple still has affection for each other, but there's too much baggage, so they have to separate. They are both intelligent, so it's unbelievable that the wife wouldn't have communicated her dissatisfaction long before, and also that the husband would be so clueless as not to notice there were issues.\nThey are both overly consumed with getting custody of their son - it's their only important goal apparently. In the real world this could have been worked out as a joint custody agreement, regardless of where the parents chose to live. The first half of the movie seemed brilliant, then it dropped the ball. Nasty fight between the couple and between their attorneys. The guy caves in; gives up his career and moves to LA because his ex-wife wants it. She is an insufferable whiner. And a corny ending of their son finally learning to read at the age of 8 - what, he's a dyslexic? And what does he read? The blurb from the beginning of the movie where the wife wrote down all the things she loved about her \"soon to be ex\" husband. How cute? Not. A cheap and cheesy cop-out ending.",

I was frustrated that till the end, Charlie, didn't even understand why their relationship went astray and even when she spelled out to him how she felt, he still didn't get it and was in my opinion the selfish one. He was used to getting what he wanted, and Nicole was used to giving in to those. Even when the child told him his own preferences, he didn't listen.I didn't think Nicole was a saint, nor did I think that Charlie was a villain.

Everything in her is delicately appropriate: the firm, and at the same time, smooth voice; the skewed and hypnotizing eyes, the provoking lips as perfect frames for touching words as \"love\" and \"nostalgia\", her performance in the movie built by the way she looks, in all possible senses. The movie begins with a formula: over an assembling of scenes, Nicole (Scarlett) and Charlie (Adam Driver) exchange compliments. We soon realize that it is discourse written in a therapeutic session. They are on the verge of separation, that indefinable, painful, irreparable, destructive, incapacitating moment. Yes, before the rupture, there was love and affection, and this is the most devastating punch at this point. Nevertheless, there is a child and he is going to be used as a manipulative element by both of them, which invariably happens in these cases. There are also the parts' lawyers: Laura Dern and Ray Liotta rock maneuvering the divorce in an indignantly and competitive way. Nicole and Charlie are at that process in which neither of them knows exactly why the marriage failed, and this is disturbing for them and, of course, for us. It seems clear that each other's dimension got lost along the time they spent together, despite (or because) the connections that still exist between them. Scarlett is the physical form of talent, playing a woman who wants the best for her family, but cannot wait anymore to make her dreams come true. Adam Driver takes off Kylo Ren's character and takes the plunge into the role that may redefine him as one of the most talented actors of his time - his losses, after the separation, are shown on his face like Mike Tyson's jabs. The director Noah Baumbach displays autobiographical references in his works, as he did in his best movie so far THE SQUID AND THE WHALE. It is not different here: he shows a depressing trait of the post-modern times, the outsourcing of the sentimental matters, in charge, here, of the two lawyers, who fight over everything that could have been but was not, as once said Manuel Bandeira.",

People have been telling me to watch this film since December and I didn't really want to watch a film about a divorce around the happy holiday season. Also, I have heard from multiple sources that this film deserves all the awards that it had been nominated for and I was worried that the film wouldn't exceed my high expectations thanks to my sources. They were right, for the most part. I personally did like the film, but I can not say that I would want to watch it again.\nMarriage Story is about a married couple that would like to get a divorce. Charlie (Adam Driver) wants to stay in New York and his soon to be ex-wife, Nicole (Scarlett Johansson) would like to move and stay in Los Angeles, they also have a child which just makes things much more difficult. This film accurately represents both sides of a divorce and in the end, you really do find yourself rooting for both sides. I personally think the scene where Charlie (Adam Driver) reads Nicoles (Scarlett Johansson) letter is really impactful to show how much they really loved each other and also why they needed to get a divorce. In the scene, their son Henry is trying to read the letter to his dad and he reads, \"He rarely gets defeated, which I feel like I always do.\" Nicole writes this letter to read to Charlie in the beginning of the movie, but she never does because she says she didn't like what she wrote.\nYes, the film is a good film, but I don't think I would personally see it again. The whole movie is about a divorce and it's almost two and a half hours long. In my opinion, this is not the usual type of movie I would find myself picking out to watch on a Saturday night. At some parts of the movie, it did drag on a bit, but I feel the acting of Adam Driver, Scarlett Johansson, Laura Dern, and many more definitely made up for the longevity of the movie. Noah Baumbach also directed the film, The Squid and the Whale, which is also a divorce story but not nearly as long. There are other movies that are also over two hours long, like Forrest Gump. When watching Forrest Gump, you don't feel like the movie is being dragged out to continue making the same point throughout the entire movie. I think, if maybe the movie wasn't over two hours long, more viewers would be interested.\nIn the film, Noah Baumbach uses many different techniques especially in point of view and costume/makeup. Throughout the movie, I feel the viewers can really understand how each character is feeling about the entire situation. We get an inside view of how Charlies friends are feeling, how Nicole's mother is feeling, and even how their child is feeling. I feel we really get everyone's perspective towards the divorce and separation. I also feel like we really get to see how the characters are feeling by what color their outfit is in some scenes. For example, in a scene where Charlie gets frustrated and angry, he is clearly wearing red to show the emotion that Baumbach wanted to portray.\nI can not say the film, Marriage Story, was my favorite. But I can say that I appreciate the acting and the idea of the film. I just feel it could have been much better if it was just a bit shorter. But, I can say that if you have been through a divorce or you have seen one first hand, you may find this film to be more emotional for you. As for me, I can not say that it is my favorite nor will I be watching it again.",

Their portrayal of parents who have so this much respect for each other and think they should hate each other and just don't, or can't. It's a tough thing to do, I felt like I was a watching a more entertaining update of Kramer Vs. Kramer.

For instance he seemed to be completely ignorant of the fact that their parents were splitting up, he did not voice any concerns about it nor ask why this has to be so, he didn't understand he's father was hurt while lying on the kitchen floor, and he said that he liked the costume his mom bought better because it cost more...

            "review_title": "A Marriage Story (if marriage is a contract and not a covenant)",
            "content": "The beginning of \"Marriage Story\" begins with a wholesome timelapse of the couple's daily lives narrated by one another reading a letter of adoration about their spouse. However, the film takes a jarring comedic twist when it's revealed to the viewer this is just the beginning of the couple's separation. This clever opening compelled me to believe the film would be more than promising, but the next two hours would only disappoint. \"Marriage Story\" is hardly about the ups and downs of a broken family, but rather, a spectacle of downs alone where the complexity of love and heartache aren't challenging each other.For a couple that could within themselves choose to see the good in their partner despite all the reasons corroding their marriage, it's hard to believe they're the same couple for the remainder of the film. The pair, Charlie (Adam Driver) and Nicole (Scarlett Johansson), are only ever able to overcome adversity scarcely when Nicole orders Charlie food and ties his shoe. This inability to rise above created very weak leads that coaxed distaste in the viewer for either one or both spouses. The two characters are overloaded with flaws that are grossly overlooked by their own judgement for the entire duration of the film, leaving them with only a single redeeming quality of wanting to do what's right (with not much motivation to do so). During their separation, neither experiences any genuine growth in their struggles outside of courtroom gain. Once the money and lawyers were out of the picture, the two are able to reconcile and be civil. Not because they worked on themselves, on the contrary, but because if they're not facing conflict that confronts their shortcomings, those shortcomings lie dormant until another issue arises. The film gives a false sense of growth, when in reality that growth was stumped by the characters' self-serving pride.Despite being stagnant characters, Driver and Johansson have pivotal points of evoking emotion from the viewer, such as when the two have an argument in Charlie's new apartment and Charlie breaks down. Johanson plays a convincing mother and estranged wife and Driver truly embodies Charlie's emotions, making him seem more surreal, which made the film easier to digest. However, when Charlie sings \"Being Alive\" to seemingly vent his feelings in a format he best understands, it became less ingenuous. The longer the scene progressed, quickly it became more of a catalyst to fill the film's desire to be an artistic, Hollywood-esque film, such as La La Land. As for the divorce lawyers the film poked fun at, Alan Alda had by far one of the best deliveries in selling his role that outshined the more superficial portrayals by Laura Dern and Ray Liotta (which is largely due to their stifling characters).Furthermore, the film hints at children being used as pawns in the courtroom, yet the film only allows room for Nicole and Charlie's child to become a convenient chest piece. Their child lacks depth or development, other than a \"mommy's boy\" attachment that causes a petty disparity between himself and his father. While Charlie and Nicole are trying to convince the viewer that their son comes first, they simultaneously are pushing for their own agendas without regard for their child, leaving their son neglected by both the couple and the script writer. For a character who is supposed to be so important to the parents, the character is treated as Waitress #2, and made ironically irrelevant to the story as a whole. Inadvertently, the boy becomes an accessory for the sake of the plot. Unfortunately, the poor development of his character made him quite unlikable, alongside his parent counterparts. In Charlie and Nicole's child, you'll find only the remnants of an idea rather than an individual, resulting in an unmemorable character whose name no one remembers (it's Henry). In this boy I see so many missed opportunities to explore the confusing pain of feeling divided between two people you love and the misguided guilt of driving them apart. In the end, you'll discover two parents who seem to care deeply and sacrificially for a child who's nothing more than a puppet who wishes he can be a boy.Overall, the story wasn't strong. The characters danced around each other and had terrible communication just as the plot did with the viewer. \"Marriage Story\" is a sensualization of divorce written from a Hollywood-skewed perspective of marriage.",

Stay in California for the weekend and spend it in Joshua Tree.Another way to hate Los Angeles is to watch this film! I'm a native of LA; I've traveled the world and I live here again. I love my sprawling city, but this film made me want to leave forever and move to Manhattan.Such typical east coast snobbery here, the shots of NY included the esoteric theater (or should I say theatre) company and the jazzy bar where the pretty girl you know is signing a tune... it was so romanticized and hence saccharin. The shots of LA were mostly of Adam Driver's character having a miserable time in a miserable apartment, surrounded by gritty mini malls. These places exist as part of the tapestry that makes LA diverse and interesting, and yet there is so much natural beauty too.Geographical diatribe over, the film packs a powerful performance punch by Adam Driver. I did side and sympathize with him while interestingly my husband found the culpability rather balanced between the two main characters. Thumbs up.",

            "review_title": "A little bit too predictable",
            "content": "Some spoilers alert...so beware.I know it's not about having a twist at the end, with performances from almost all the cast being stellar who needs one. The directing is fantastic, love many of the scenes that were done a bit differently such as the carpark ticket scene. But somehow for this to be rated over on average as an 8 is a little high in my view.The story is a little too predictable and the ending does not give you much satisfaction. It is littered with several liberals, let's say, propaganda which to me kind of takes away from the artistic side of the movie a little bit. But hey you can't watch a film these days without some political nuances or liberal or conservative propaganda being injected forcibly these days.I love many sides of the movie but in the end it's just what you would expect from a drama about divorce with a kid stuck in the middle. It was quite a lot more focused on the wife's side of the story, making you think that there is a lesson to be learned intended to be for men more than for women. But there were moments when the film was trying to show the shortcomings of the wife too but did not go on bringing the balance required for this to be a complete story.At the end part the ex-wife had found another man and the husband was made to look like the losing party by being single. The wife was nominated for an Emmy for her directing skills, so she is actually the one that is more talented than the husband, telling us all that she had the last laugh and once again another strong indication that it was the husband who is to be blamed and the one who screwed the marriage up by holding her back all this while and not helping her find her own thing in life other than being a supportive wife.\nThere was also a scene when the husband was seen to have badly cut himself but again I can't tell what it is about, there were scenes of this nature that you can't quite piece it together other than making the audience realise that this is all the husband wrongdoing.However there were some attempts to show some balance. The wife was not all free of fault. During the scene where the big argument took place in the house, the film brought us some insights into the wife sort of neglecting the husband and also sucking the joy out of his life, indicating that women can take the fun out of everything but in the beginning she was described as being the fun one who loves to play all the time. The argument ended very abruptly with the husband screaming some very unkind words of wishing her to die. There was however no follow through on the mistakes or shortcoming of the wife in their marriage for this story to be balanced in the later part of the show. I get it that the world wants to think that men are often oblivious to his surroundings in a marriage and are not sensitive enough to their wives needs, so there is an element of feminism too which as I said takes away from the artistic side of the movie.In the end I felt the ending was too compressed and rushed. 2/3rd of the movie could have been shortened for the ending to give the story a better balance of highlighting what both parties did wrong and how viewers of gender can learn from this story. I felt this movie should not try to masquerade as a marriage story as it takes two to tango. It should be 'An Ex-Wife Story' or something like that.However from directing and acting, wow, just wow. Johansson was at another level altogether, a truly versatile artist. Apologies for the typos/grammar...had to share this views within short amount of available time.",

I mean, there is so much that it's being said about Adam Driver's and Scarlet Johansson's performances, as they both deliver poignant and heart wrenching depictions of what is like to be a complex and often contradictory human being, it is nonetheless astonishing the virtuosso manner in wich Noah Baumbach picks the key moments in a divorce and lets us know how hard it is to keeo things friendly and loving in the midst of a system that makes every decision feel that much definitive and cruel. Every character is well written and I think this might be the best work that Baumbach hast put out to this date. Not only that, but this might be one of the best dramas with Divorce as its main topic right there along Kramer vs Kramer.",

            "review_title": "A Need for Change.",
            "content": "A bittersweet comedy about an marriage that is changing, but not ending. Actress, Nicole Barber (Scarlett Johansson) and husband and establish play director Charlie Barber (Adam Driver) work through a coast-to-coast divorce as Nicole pursues a Hollywood acting career. Marriage Story focuses on the struggle of changing dreams in life and in a marriage. Compromise is something not negotiable for this couple. The couple fights to find what is best for their son, Henry, as their lawyers fight to make Nicole and Charlie the enemy. Marriage Story, a Netflix original, gives the story of an established New York couple who works through marital problems in their own way.\nThe theme of this film is change. Change can come in many different forms and it can define someone's character by how they react to the world changing around them. In this film, Nicole and Charlie are going through a pretty serious divorce, a divorce that they did not see in their future. But, was necessary because according to Nicole, Charlie was a control freak of their marriage and never really listened to what Nicole wanted. There were many different factors that caused their divorce and the elements of the divorce causes some serious changes in this family of three. Change can be difficult for some, or a necessity for others, but how you react can often define who you are.\nThis film uses many techniques to make this film as great as it really is. The use of lighting and dialogue make this film. When in New York, the lighting of the film seems darker, giving that depressive East coast feel, while in California, everything is bright, representing new hope and happiness the sunshine gives. This is important because it shows the difference between the two cities and it also goes to Henry's emotions of his living situations. Henry was born in California, but grew up in New York. Once Nicole moved back out to California, Henry was happier, found more friends at school, and was around his cousins more than he was in New York. The lighting of these scenes help show Henry's happiness and how he thinks his life is better in California. Dialogue also helped created the emotion and intensity of the film. One scene that relied heavily on the use of good dialogue was the scene towards the end of the film where Nicole and Charlie were yelling at each other in Charlie's California apartment living room. They start off discussing what is best for Henry because during the divorce, they had moved away from the well-being of their child. This scene develops into a heated yelling match about all the things that they see wrong with each other and how their marriage did not work. Without the words said from both Charlie and Nicole, this scene would never have had the impact it did without the use of strong language and good use of dialogue. There were plenty of other film techniques used in this film, but lighting and dialogue were the most effective.\nMarriage Story depicted a couple living the dream in New York until they were not anymore. Nicole and Charlie Barber were a successful, play producing couple, until Nicole wanted to change her career. Things went downhill when Charlie did not support her like she did for him all those year. This film was a story of change and how the characters responded to that change.\n& Scene.",

I don't think I've seen a film be this heartbreaking while also being pretty funny throughout. That alone probably makes this my favorite screenplay of the year.The pacing in Marriage Story never seemed to drag throughout its runtime. The story feels so complete. It goes beyond what typical movies would go for, so the 2 hours feels full rather than bloated. Not to mention the fact that the characters, in true Baumbach form, actually feel real.The acting was, of course, outstanding in this. While this isn't my favorite Scarlett Johansson performance, it's a pretty fantastic one at that. Both her & Adam Driver easily give some of the best performances of the year. Laura Dern, Ray Liotta & Alan Alda were great as well.Behind the camera, Noah Baumbach isn't doing anything mind-blowing, but this movie never looks dull. It always looks beautiful, like a classic film in the making. The music from Randy Newman was also amazing.I genuinely don't know how this could've been executed better. This could've been another forgetful Oscar bait movie. Instead, Noah Baumbach delivered a truly substantive film that people will talk about for a while.",

I fell in love with films in a very young age and thats mainly because of how open minding they are.

I watched it with my man so luckily I know not all men have the same lack of emotional empathy. I as a woman swayed back and forth and tbh I say you must be a woman hating if you couldnt see it from her point of view ever.Believe me, if it was a movie where the roles were reversed - and a male gave up all of his personality and life to cater to a woman's dreams for 10 years, where the man moved away from his family, was being critiqued by the woman in the way he acted, even had his hair and the woman asked the man to put whatever money he made into her dream - AND then she cheated on him AND then she expected him to praise her for all the men she didn't have sex with while she had the chance...you would NEVER see any man feel the least bit sorry for the woman being forced to then give up her dream and have to actually also adjust so the man could find himself and be close with his family where he came from.So.

Yes, the acting is great, but you don't really build a connection with any of the characters. Even though a lot of effort is put into the dialogues, it still feels like you never really get to know them, and therefore, you don't truly root for them. We watched it without any background information, so we were hoping on a marriage revival, but this never happens. You don't even see them make an effort to save it, despite the very touching letters they wrote about each others qualities in the beginning of the movie. For me, the movie was interesting while I believed there was still a chance of them making it better. That a deeper layer might be touched, instead of all the superficial lawyer stuff. (Which was amusing, and sometimes uncomfortable, but nothing more than that). However, it's all about the breakup and therefore, 'Divorce Story' would have been a better name. I cried while watching Mrs Doubtfire (also a dramatic comedy about a divorce, and a father doing anything to see his kids), but with this movie: not a single tear, not even close. The difference is: in Mrs Doubtfire, you could actually truly relate to the characters and their motives, their pain, you get attached to them as a family and as individuals. Marriage story didn't do that for us at all and I'm sure I've forgotten about this movie in 1 or 2 years. I'm still not sure what this movie wanted to teach us, if anything.",

OTOH, it is hard to believe two seemingly smart people would get themselves into the situation portrayed.\nBaumbach has a reputation, no doubt about that, from a brief survey of his work.

There is a lot of good stuff out there - the Gottman Institute for one - it would be completely plausible for two intelligent, warm, real people to seek reconciliation and to always be glad they did.

You might think that sounds kinda realistic, but the reality is it feels a bit\u2026 off, like there aren't a lot of powerful moments because of Baumbach's conscious effort not to take it too far in either direction. That being said, there are a few moments that hit exactly as they should (there's a fantastic argument scene) and I found that the film worked best when it explored the stronger, raw emotions of the individual characters \u2013 love, hate, anger \u2013 instead of documenting the process of divorce itself (lawyers, houses, money etc.).

Whether it is in the production design where a scene is taking place, an unforgettable line in the screenplay, or the lovely score in the background.

It is the minor scenes where we are impacted most, such as:\n\n- Charlie does not know what to order during the lawyers' meeting \n- Charlie waiting for his child on Halloween, falling asleep on the couch dressed as Frankenstein in the process.\n- Nicole rushing to her room after talking to Charlie and breaking down into sobs from pain and anger after a small argument. \n- Laura's Derns iconic 2 minute monologue about the standards and pressure society puts on mothers compared to fathers (where after viewing that scene, I immediately knew she had the Oscar).\n\nThese scenes are what make the film more beautiful and heartbreaking.

If you are willing to put in the time and deal with some draggy scenes, watch this film because the majority of the movie is so well made that you will be happy once the credits begin to roll.",

But what makes the film different from other divorce films such as Kramer vs Kramer is the use of comedy and creating a lighter visual experience. Don't get it wrong though, Marriage Story is a sad film overall, but it's the comedy that helps alleviate the pain of seeing people fall out of love. Scarlett Johansson and Adam Driver do a splendid job of digging into their characters and providing growth throughout the duration of the film. They display a variety of emotions and play their characters in a very grounded nature. Laura Dern is a definite standout as the cocky but well intentioned divorce lawyer for Scarlett's character in the film. Azhy Robertson, who plays the son of the couple, does a great job of playing the child who just can't seem to grasp the magnitude of what his parents are going through. The real star of the movie however is definitely Noah Baumbach. He delivers a story that could have been dreadful to watch, but provides it in such a way that by the time the movie ends, it leaves in a bittersweet mood. A delightfully sad film, go watch it once it's up on Netflix! One of my favourites during the festival!",

Shortly after the court scene, the best scene in the movie follows. The argument scene was one of the best scenes that I have ever seen. The emotions, the power, the way it was shot. The scene was just raw. It was painful to see these characters' lives fall apart after we saw everything they were going through and also knowing what their child was going through.

(Written by Netflix)\n\nMarriage Story is one of the best if not the best films that talk about two couples who get separated/divorced. Everything about is real and genuine especially the dialogues. It also has very few comedy in it so the film doesn't seem dull/boring which gave the film a special taste. \n\nFirstly, in my opinion, this is Scarlett Johansson's best performance so far. She succeeded in giving us that great character of the wife Nicole. She gave us one of the best long take scenes of the film, especially that the film has many of these scenes. But, this one specifically was the best because it was focused on her and just her, it felt so real/genuine with her beautiful acting. Adam Driver also gave us one of the best performances of his career for sure. anytime when he was crying or shouting, it all felt so real. In any scene where the two actors were together, it felt like a boom because both of their performances were better than the other, and the famous scene where the two were having an argument, proves it.\n\nSecondly, Noah Baumbach is such an amazing director and screenwriter. When you watch a Noah Baumbach film, it will be obvious because his scripts are written in a way that would make any scene or dialogue seem so real/genuine. His way of directing too is so unique and amazing especially in this film, the cinematography and the transitions were so smooth and well done. This film's dialogues really reminded me of Frances Ha (2012) that was directed by him and written by him & his partner Greta Grewing who is also an amazing screenwriter, and we saw how amazing she is in Lady Bird (2017) and Little Women (2019) that were both directed by her. Noah Baumbach & Greta Grewing are some of the best directors & screenwriters. \n\nOne thing I didn't like about the film is that I felt like sometimes the story of one side only wasn't being told as much as the other side which seemed unfair and we didn't get to know what this person thinks or what their opinion is as much as we did with the other side. Also, I felt like I needed to know more about their backstory or about other situations that would explain to the audience more about their relationship/love. But, all reasons for the two getting divorced were very reasonable and presented in a way that people nowadays would relate to which made the film unique, related, and so real with all of its dialogues & scenes.\n\nA beautiful film that's filled with great acting performances, directing, cinematography, and a little bit of comedy to cool down the energy of the film.\n\nMy rating is 9/10",

            "content": "\"TAKES MY BREATH AWAY\" LOVE FILMS\nby Timothy J. Verret\n\nI'm as drawn to love films as a beautiful and majestic horse is drawn to water. I create so much about and from the notion of love that it sometimes is hard for me to take a decent, deep breath. Here are 10 (actually 11) films about love (or the lack thereof) that \"take my breath away\" and heal my still-sometimes-very-broken heart (BOTH!):\n\n1. SHAKESPEARE IN LOVE (1998):\nThis would indeed be my all-time favorite love film because it's got Shakespeare and it's got that message: \"Love is the ONLY inspiration.\" This film is inspired by a great and awe-inspiring love for acting, writing, directing, and how passion engages all of these things in one love film. Even if this film was not an ode to why Shakespeare wrote sonnets in the first place, the scene where Viola is onstage in a staged production of Shakespeare's ROMEO AND JULIET and William is lovingly looking at her from the wings is more than enough of a reason why I adore this love film. Viola loves William, William loves Viola, and the music takes us away to just this one moment of two looks and two smiles all looked and smiled in the name of a beautiful, all-encompassing love. That scene alone \"takes my breath way\" every time I see it. Even though this film is #10 on my all-time favorite films' list, it is solidly #1 on my all-time favorite love films' list (I guess you could say, \"so the last shall be first, and the first shall be last\" [Matthew 20:16]). \ud83d\ude09\n\n2. SCENES FROM A MARRIAGE (1973):\nSwedish director Ingmar Bergman is not known for gushy and silly love films, but this film IS a very serious love film because Bergman gives us both the glory and grime of a marriage dissolving. In true and typical Bergman fashion, each scene of this film is a very serious \"take my breath away,\" because the truth and turmoil at the heart of this marriage ending are about as real as my hand in front of my face. Liv Ullmann and Erland Josephson as Marianne and Johan give towering performances. I will never forget the scene where Marianne and Johan go to the lawyer's office to sign the divorce papers and literally get into a fist fight. After the fight (and the marriage) is over, they both with their tattered hair and hearts sign the divorce papers. This film is as stunning as it is sacrificial. Marriage IS sacrifice and when that's not there, stunning is any marriage's dissolvement. I probably could have listed a handful of Ingmar Bergman films that explore the theme of this kind of intense love, but I have to keep this list as brief as possible.\ud83d\ude09\n\n3. MARRIAGE STORY (2019):\nVery much like SCENES FROM A MARRIAGE, this film is haunting and often horribly uneasy to sit through. Scarlett Johansson as Nicole and Adam Driver as Charlie give exceptionally riveting performances as a married couple with way too big egos (she is an actress and he is a theatre director and if that's not \"way too big egos,\" I don't know what is). I will never forget the scene where Nicole goes to Charlie's apartment and they are in the throws of so much anger and so much hurt that the walls of Charlie's apartment are about to come down. Johansson's Nicole delivers to Driver's Charlie the line that is THE line where love hoped to save this marriage and love can't save this marriage intersect, \"You're so merged with your own selfishness, you don't even identify it as selfishness anymore!\" That line \"took my breath away\" because I totally identified with it. A marriage on its way to a divorce is all about selfishness unidentified anymore. The proclaimed egos of both partners \"win out\" and when ego \"wins out,\" everything is \"lost in\" a marriage war of two \"way too big egos.\"\n\n4. THE DANISH GIRL (2015):\nIt's so cool that this film is #4 on this list, as #4 is my spiritual number. It's also cool that this film is #4 on my all-time favorite films' list, as well. The story of Gerda and Einar (Lily) Wegener is what love films should always be about: The sacrifice one partner needs to make for a marriage to survive (often times in a marriage, both partners have to make sacrifices). Gerda makes the ultimate sacrifice by accepting that her husband, Einar, believes he is a woman and wants to have an operation to become Lily, the woman he always was on the inside. Anyone else that I can think of in Gerda's position would have said in response to this, \"no way, no how\u2026.this marriage is OVER!\" Gerda loves Einar so much that she is willing to do just about anything (and she does) to keep their love alive. Alicia Vikander (Oscar winner for Best Supporting Actress) is an absolute and complete revelation in her performance as Gerda, and Eddie Redmayne completely and totally seals the deal in his performance in this film to make him my all-time favorite actor next to Joaquin Phoenix. I swear I could go on and on about how this film \"takes my breath away\" at every twist and turn where love is concerned but, once again, I'm needing to be brief here.\ud83d\ude09\n\n5. YENTL (1983):\nVery similar to THE DANISH GIRL, this film is not your conventional love film. It's about a woman who loves this man who thinks a woman is a man, this man who loves another woman who is also a woman but since he can't have this other woman, the man asks a woman to marry this other woman so he can be close to this other woman, and a woman who this man thinks is a man marries this other woman, and if none of that \"takes your breath away,\" I'm not sure what ever would! This film \"takes my breath away\" because it's simply about the lengths and heights and depths we find ourselves reaching for in the throes (or thrown) of love. And because I am a huge Barbra Streisand fan and this is Barbra's best film EVER, I can't think of any other love film that pleases and excites me more than this one. And never mind that it is mainly because of Barbra Streisand and my love for her that helped me to believe that I could ever be someone someday who could love someone someday. Now, that \"takes my breath away.\"\n\n6. WHO'S AFRAID OF VIRGINIA WOOLF? (1966):\nWhile most in a million years would never call this film a \"love film,\" I do because it's a film about the absence of love in a marriage, the absence that is SO common in a lot of marriages, and an absence so penetrable that the married couple in this film actually make up that they have a child to keep the marriage bearable. Edward Albee's play and Mike Nichols' film adaptation are what I love most about stories where love has flown the coop (if it was ever in the coop in the first place), i.e., the dissection and probing of the insides of people who are losing their identity because love has become nonexistent while brutality and mean-spiritedness are what's left to exist. Elizabeth Taylor, known for her striking beauty, goes from \"riches to rags\" in her physical beauty and gives us an \"ugly\" Martha, a force of nature who is as forceful as she is vulnerable. Taylor, Best Actress Oscar winner) gives what I consider the very best female performance ever captured on film. Richard Burton as George and George Segal as Nick are also excellent, but it's the other female performance of Sandy Dennis as Honey (Best Supporting Actress Oscar winner) that makes this love film truly one that \"takes my breath away\" every time I see it\u2026.and I've seen it a lot!\ud83d\ude09\n\n7. TESS (1980):\nIf there can be any love film that is truly lovely to look it, it would be this film. Based on Thomas Hardy's classic novel of the same name, Roman Polanski directed this film that makes the novel come breathtakingly and beautifully alive. This film \"takes my breath away\" not just because it's pretty to look at but also because it is rapturous and daring to expose seduction between a man and a woman as actually rape, and how that one act of domination produces shame that stays with the victim. I know that one's shame is to be nailed to The Cross of Jesus but for some, death is the one way, and maybe the only way, to be rid of that shame. Nastassja Kinski as Tess might not be the best actress who ever lived, but Polanksi knew exactly what he was doing by casting her in the title role. Because Kinski was a relative unknown and maybe because Polanski knew she wasn't the greatest actress around, it was precisely these two very things that allowed Kinski to inhabit Tess as bright-eyed innocent, and na\u00efve. A well-known and a great actress would have destroyed these precious traits, so thank God Polanski and Kinski didn't. There's one scene of a closeup of Tess with the brightest yellow sun behind her that to this day, every time I see a sun like that, it \"takes my breath away,\" and I call it, \"the Tess sun.\" LOVE THAT! \u2764\ufe0f\n\n8. THE WAY WE WERE (1973):\nIt certainly makes sense that I would have two Barbra Streisand films on this list but even if I didn't love Streisand, this film would be on it anyway and probably most others' \"love film\" list. It's the ultimate love story of the girl over there and the guy over here and how there and here come together and we are all the better for being present to witness that. The odds are that two beautiful actors like Redford and Streisand couldn't possibly go wrong in a beautiful love film that ends with a closing scene that still \"takes my breath away.\" Streisand's Katie and Redford's Hubbell are looking at each other after having separated when famous Streisand takes that famous hand and famously brushes away that famous hair from Redford's famous face. \"See ya', Katie.\" \"See ya' Hubbell.\" See me balling my eyes out.\ud83d\ude25\ud83d\ude25\n\n9. CASABLANCA (1942):\nWhile not the film I would have included on my \"take my breath away\" love films' list, I'm including it because it's on the top of the list for two of my favorite people and because any film with an actor or actress with the last name of \"Bergman\" should be on any film list I compile (see #2 for that \"other Bergman\" film). That said, I have seen this film and I remember loving it very much. Many \"love film\" aficionado's are divided into two camps where this film's ending is concerned: One group wants Rick to let Ilsa board that plane to Lisbon with Laszlo for The Resistance, while the other group says, \"C'mon! Rick and Ilsa forever! We're not talking about The Resistance here! We're talking about love!\" This film reminds us that love doesn't always end as victorious as The Resistance, but what we cannot \"resist\" is that we loved in the first place. That is usually enough for any kind of love to take flight.\n\n10. IT HAPPENED ONE NIGHT (1934) and SOMEWHERE IN TIME (1980):\nI admit I was torn between which of these films to include to round out the top 10 \"take my breath away\" love films, until it dawned on me that both films have something very much in common: The element of time when and where love is lost and/or found. IT HAPPENED ONE NIGHT is simple enough to say love can happen one night, whereas SOMEWHERE IN TIME says one night is fine, but true love cannot be contained by the element of time. Love can happen one night, sure, and then more nights can happen after that, but sometimes you have to go \"somewhere in time\" to find that love again. Whether one night or \"somewhere in time,\" love alters us to our very core and we do search time and space to find it, but there are no guarantees that the Jericho Walls (reference to the ending of IT HAPPENED ONE NIGHT) will stay up or come down when love happens in just one night or \"somewhere\" outside of space and time for a lifetime.\n\nNow, I'm not currently in a love relationship (unless you count Jesus) but if I were, my partner would need to have seen AT LEAST one of these films. If not, watching AT LEAST one of these films is essential if any partner who loves me expects to \"take my breath away.\" \ud83d\ude09\u2764\ufe0f",

It seems like it is heartfelt and thoughtful, deep, enlightened, warm, complex, philosophical---but after viewing I feel like I've been eating potato chips rather than having a substantial nourishing meal. Clearly he's talented and not stupid. The writing is fine. He has directorial skills. But there's a superficiality and faint whiff of nihilism around him that you won't find in, say, Wes Anderson,  Richard Linklater, Jim Jarmush. And while someone like Scorsese is nihilistic he (a) struggles with that and (b) is unabashed about it. Something about Noah Baumbach's posturing about being humanistic gets up my nose. His work is carefully crafted but, to me, ultimately somewhat hollow--possibly because most of his work is about himself, thinly veiled to be about humanity and the human condition but ultimately his own view of the world and humankind arising directly from his own lived experiences---passed off as insightful, but perhaps just under the surface lurks semi-smug self-preoccupation and narcissism. Rendered---but not created. He's good at what he does. tho. And performances from all the cast are outstanding.",

In it there are disappearances, murders and a lot of violence scenes. \nThis series tell us the story of Anna, who is a single mother who lives with her two teenage children and for different reasons they had to move to Curon, the town where Anna, the mother, grew up. When they arrive to the town everything unfolds in a calm way, but slowly the story becomes more tense and strange things begin to happen. \nIn my opinion, I think it\u00b4s a series that you should watch because it uses good actors, that maybe are too recognized, but they perform very well in their role. Another good point is that the town is very emblematic, this means that the cloudy and dark landscapes are attached to a horror story, and the music that it uses is surprising.

            "content": "In short, it's a tiresome and dull look at a crumbling marriage.  Noah Baumbach was extremely lucky by the generous reviews and acclaim he has received from this film. \nFrom a filmmaker's standpoint, this film was many notches below Scenes from a Marriage by Ingmar Bergman or Kramer vs. Kramer. A Marriage Story was too derivative of what we have already seen and there were no exemplary traits that made it stand out from the films that came before it. It was self-indulgent and visionless. When thinking back on the film, there is one scene that comes to mind that stands out but is not distinct. The scene, which is the most talked about, takes place in the very drab apartment where they let out their emotions. This scene felt like a rehearsal or improvised exercise for actors rather than a cinematic, well-written scene where the words make you feel. Rather, it was the actors doing their jobs well, with the wrong dialogue. The writing gives me no reason to feel empathy for them.\nThe apartment was an accurate portrayal of a typical badly designed apartment in LA but the realism of it was uninspiring and bleak. Sure, that could have been the point and probably his intention but is realism and bleakness what we need in cinema? Where are the days when films felt like an escape and not some depressing rollercoaster through a dismal life? It would be one thing if Noah Baumbach wanted insight into these kinds of relationships from a sociological standpoint and was an upbeat positive person (the opposite of the characters), but he is in fact just taking from his own sad experiences that frankly have been done far better and don't deserve this type of attention. \nOverall, there was an unnatural feeling to the whole film that placed oneself in between a film and theater and an audition room. I appreciate some of Noah Baumbach's work but this one was a miss for me, he can do better. Unlike the Meyerowitz stories, the casting was off and although the actors performed well, I didn't believe in their initial reason for being together or their cry-baby emotions that felt contrived. \nMy last question is, who cares about some random couple in LA going through a divorce? There are more important stories to be told that involve realism. Noah Baumbach, stop being so self-absorbed.",

            "content": "This is such a beautiful movie! While it is clear from the start that the movie talks about the separation process of a couple, it is trully able to tell their whole marriage story. It tells you how they met, when and why they fell in love, what started to feel wrong at some point and what lead to the break up, all that in a very sutil way (while it feels like just a divorce story is being told, maybe no such story can be told without describing the whole relationship). It does not try to convince you that they might get together and play with your expectation that they will do so at some point, it is mostly interested in \"studying\" the feelings and actions of a divorce. Nicole and Charlie love each other. They do have problems, they do seem confident about their decision of divorcing, they do get too involved in the process but, in the end, they love each other. Right from the very first scenes, the incredibly beautiful descriptions each character makes of the other already shows how much love and care is still there. This is such a rich montage in my view, not only for the beautiful soundtrack and the rythm of images but for how it is able to describe the characters and also show how they view each other. Charlie already seems to be more critic while Nicole almost worships her husband. The movie shows the divorce process in such a raw and real way, making it so clear that there will never be a true winner in this case because they love and care about the family; any result will feel like a loss. Things escalate without intention, what also sometimes seems unavoidable in a situation full of tension and misunderstood feelings.\u2028There are several powerful scenes besides the initial montage: the long conversation that turns into a fierce argument (the only one in which feelings are actually showed), Charlie singing Being Alive with an excruciating amount of feeling, Charlie reading a book for his kid lying at the same bed in which Nicole weeps at the side, Charlie and their son reading the initial letter wrote by Nicole. This is a sad, soul-crushing experience but that feels extremely real and shows with precision the complexity of feelings and events surrounding a divorce. I really loved it.",

This movie isn't just a divorce story about two people yelling at each other for the entire movie. It shows you what really goes on during a couple's struggles from both sides. Neither one is the \"bad\" guy and both want what's best for their kid and also each other. It also shows you the legal battles that goes behind a lot of divorces which was really interesting to see. The music was beautiful and it was one of my favorite parts of the movie. Another part that I think is underappreciated is the cinematography. The entire movie looks like a moving photograph. It represents the fact that when you look at one, you remember what happened behind that photograph and the memories begin to start flowing in. It made the movie really feel like it was about the whole family and not just a single person. I also love how they did then ending. It didn't feel depressing or bad at all. In the end you're not mad or angry at one of them, you just hope the best for both of them and that's it. The acting is amazing and I adore everything about this movie.

Also, have to give Noah Baumbach the credit he deserves for crafting the brilliant dialogue in this film. Haven't ever been through a divorce so I can't speak to the accuracy, but I really loved how real all of the characters felt based on the way they interacted with one another and how their behavior changed towards their child as the plot progressed.

Even Charlie, who initially seems to consider it only a temporary separation, does not even mention an intention of reunion, sometime in the future. From either side, there's no hint of will of working out the differences and find a compromise, of exploiting the separation for the good of the couple and the family.\n\nEven though it's easy to relate to both the main characters and share their point of view, Nicole is portrayed in a slightly more negative light. She breaks the promise to do without lawyers, which may not have been such a bad thing had she told Charlie she had changed her mind instead of deploying tricks to get an early upper hand. She even goes as far as to mortgage her mom's house to pay the lawyers. That would be understandable under dire circumstances, but not when your husband is begging you to find a consensual agreement and not throw money out of the window, that could instead be saved for the child's future. He is instead depicted as slightly more responsible, and only resorts to the top-dollar lawyer after having been thoroughly battered and humiliated together with his earlier, more humane lawyer.",

            "content": "i myself, as someone who never liked the idea of marriage, see this movie as something that holds great importance, and a wake-up call for the people who are swamped with emotions that couldn't sort themselves out of the mess. of course, me as a young millennial, living in an international big city, has been in an open relationship and believes in polyamory myself, isn't interested in kids and dislikes marriage as a system - it might seem easy for me to get over the ideas, but the challenges presented in the movie are very real, for people who indeed decided to go down the isle: when interests become more intertwined, when there are kids, when the time has been long that it's next to impossible to reverse the roles and expectations established through time in the relationship, the only way out is to break it off, but even that is not easy, and breaking it off by no means is equal to not having feelings anymore. what the lawyers were doing were negotiations, they of course, pointed out the parts that were positive towards their own customer, but as more and more dirty truths (or lies) were spilled out, neither of them was totally innocent without fault, although they both appeared to be genuinely good people. although the ending was really emotional that i was almost crying, and it kinda ended with a positive light, the drama, hurt, betrayal, power and control, the struggle between one's own identity and the role in the relationship and family, those things had left permanent marks that in no way could be lightened by the slightly happy ending. my takeaways on practical marriage and relationship advice would be, first, there's no secret - don't think that you can cheat and hide well, most likely the lies you've told will ultimately come back to you, no matter how innocent your intentions might have been; second, it's very important to be able to maintain one's own identity in a relationship, and compromises especially on the big decisions in life cannot be one sided, and this is particularly important for women who face more pressure from both the society and their intimate partners; third, be as clear as possible about each person's responsibility, the kids can be the most tricky thing, but maybe it would be easier if there were two kids, i'm not very sure. in general, a decision to share a life with someone else is a huge one, don't take it lightly, don't let infatuation be the sole factor in this decision.",

The story is basically a husband and a wife going through struggles in their marriage, in the beginning, you wouldn't think they were having problems at all. \nThe acting between the husband and the wife towards each other did not feel fake or like you could tell it was written for a movie. It made me feel like I was in real life and it showed the actual reality of a lot of lives that I have never thought of. There is one scene in particular that I think was the one the best acting I've ever seen, and the movie itself was done very well. \nI liked the storyline and how it continued to play out throughout the movie. My favorite part was probably the ending. At first honestly, I thought I hated it, but you think you hate it because you wish the story would have turned out differently. But you know that, again, in reality, the ending is really how it would be in real life. It made me so angry at the end but that's what made it so good. I would usually cry or feel sad for the couple, but instead, I was angry but also content because I knew that's really what life is like. It is definitely a movie for older kids and adults. Honestly, the use of all the language makes the movie so much better and adds more emotion. My parents also enjoyed the movie and thought the acting was very well done.",

A loving couple is getting a divorce. It's starts of smoothly, but turns worse as it goes to court and the war is in. Words they don't mean are slung and salty tricks by both lawyers and the couple. Both are going to rough times, not to mention the kid that means the world to both of them. You kind of cheer on one of them, but both individuals share good points.\n\nThis film has a screenplay that are absolutely amazing. It's carried by the performances and the words they utter. The gentle, sweet fun and the sadder fights and self-sorrow is also key to keep this thing together. It's rather long, but not a dull moment here for me.

Worse, the film doesn't present a credible motivation for the characters' situation, nor for any of the decisions the characters make. These problems are there from the opening's misdirection where we are treated to how much the protagonists like each other only to shift, with no explanation, into the current setting where they are, inconsistently, alienated. Then, again for no credible reason, Nicole turns to a divorce lawyer and then both characters turn into unidimensional victims of the writer's screed against divorce lawyers. That leads to an unrealistic set piece of everything turning vicious in the courtroom in a way no judge I know would allow. Another set piece follows when Nicole and Charlie, again incredibly, brutally lash out at each other verbally, only to have things end with a predictably bittersweet conclusion where Nicole and Charlie, apparently reconciled to their separation, exchange sad looks. And then there's the rather bizarre back-to-back scenes where Nicole and Charlie both, rather poorly, take on Sondheim numbers. These scenes come out of nowhere, go nowhere, and contribute nothing at all to the story. I suppose, given how badly the rest of this is written, these songs might have been the writer's lazy attempt to use these songs as a commentary on the characters' inner states. But, just like most of the rest of this, they're just another couple of scenes that fail to work. Disappointing.",

Scarlett Johansson and Adam Driver gave a strong and memorable performance in this movie that led to their Academy nominations. They will never be forgotten in this movie! But another supporting act to credit is Laura Dern whom I think shines in any movie she's on since I first watched her in Jurassic Park. Dern deserves a solo lead Oscar worthy best actress award film next as proven by her Oscar win for best supporting actress. Others might not relate to divorce issue as it differs from audience but Marriage Story deserves an Oscar Best Picture nomimation because what presented in this film is a real-life struggles of living in separation and divorce. It presented to us how really hard it is - financially draining and also how extreme it will test your character.

Charlie and Nicole start the story by writing about each other, the things they love about each other when they are in one of the therapist sessions. Nicole declines to share her writings and Charlie was keen on sharing his but Nicole was no longer interested in Charlie or his thoughts. What sounds like a perfect marriage, slowly shows us how the two ends up destroying each other in ways they never thought they could. \nCharlie has always been dependent on his work, his life revolved around his theatre. His choices were based on what he thought would be best, Nicole never had a say and it was getting to a point where she felt she was nothing but worthless as an individual. The writer and the director of the movie have played with emotions, not everything is sad and dull, there is a lot of humor as well. The scene where Nicole wants to serve Charlie with the papers has to be one of the best scenes in the movie, it shows the complete chaos that happens in a family. \nThe couple had agreed to solve everything by themselves and make sure that their son does not feel the wrath of the divorce. But when Nicole moves back to LA, she becomes a totally different person, in her terms she's finally free and can make decisions and choices of her own. Henry, their son slowly loses interest in his father as he enjoys his mother's company more. Charlie does not give up on his son easily, he in fact fights for him till the very end. \nYou get to experience the true bitter nature of both the characters when they involve the lawyers. Nicole's lawyer Nora is well known to get the best possible deals for her clients, while Charlie struggles to find a lawyer at first, he later finds someone who was very lethargic in nature. Charlie eventually hires Jay after he realizes Nicole is ready to destroy him no matter what. \nA scene where Charlie and Nicole go against each other is probably one of the most emotional scenes of the movie as you get to understand how bad they could taint each other. The movie ends with possibly one of the best sequences in which Henry is reading the notes that Nicole had made in the first scene of the movie, Charlie reads it and eventually bursts into tears and Nicole stands behind him equally emotional. Marriage story is indeed a complete circle.",

Throughout the film, the viewer witnesses the good intentions of former spouses be ripped apart by the legal process of divorce and replaced with cruelty, apathy, and unequal conditions. Adam Driver and Scarlett Johansson gave the best performances of their careers. From screaming matches to the small, intimate moments between the former couple, Driver and Johansson provided so much emotional weight for Noah Baumbach to work with. Laura Dern gave an excellent performance as the cutthroat divorce attorney trying to get her client everything she ever wanted, completely overriding any sentiment Nicole may have still had for Charlie. Despite Charlie's deplorable actions during their marriage, the viewer sympathizes his plight as his world is turned upside down and his son is permanently brought to L.A., a testament to Driver's incredible work with the character. While the apartment meeting scene is by far the most emotionally impactful, there were countless scenes in the film where Charlie and Nicole's pain, anguish, and resignation could be palpably felt. Baumbach did a fantastic job getting the best performances out of Driver and Johansson and his subtle camera shifts during purely conversational scenes helped sell the realism of the film. I was thoroughly overjoyed at the ending as in real life, divorce is not merely bitter arguments and loathing one another (at least in some cases). The love was still present between Nicole and Charlie, it just manifests itself through their mutual love of their son - which is how divorce should be. Overall, Marriage Story is an excellent movie and a testament to how impactful realism in the film industry can be.",

This movie takes realism seriously. Like that scene where Nicole is talking to Nora and she gets up and walks to the bathroom to get a tissue all while saying her story and that little touch just really added to the experience because it is something that someone would do in real life (get a tissue to blow their nose while crying) yet you would never see it in a movie except for this one.\nI don't think it had an amazing story but I really joined it and definitely think that it is a must watch",

He gets my vote, 100%. He holds back so much in a just stressful and heart racing performance that will be scary and disturbing, yet also sympathetic and tear jerking.

It's kind of funny though, as it's been on my list for a while, and of all days to watch it, I unknowingly picked Valentine's Day.  It wasn't until a friend pointed out the irony that I realized the choice I subconsciously made.  So it's an excellent movie.  The performances are so genuine that it feels so real.  You feel like you know the family and they're your friends.  You feel for them during the tougher times, they melt your heart during the good times, and they make your blood boil during the hostile parts.  It's a rollercoaster ride of emotions.  I absolutely do not agree with Laura Dern winning the Oscar for best supporting actress.  She didn't stand out at all imo, and if anything I though Ray Liotta did a more memorable job that her.  I'm shocked she won the award.  I feel like this movie experience for ppl going through a divorce will be akin to hearing an Adele song.  You feel like the art is made specifically for you... like the art is about your life.  Just like how divorced women felt attached to Eat Love Pray way back when.  It's that kind of movie.  But it's not made just for them... it's made for everybody.  In some way or another, bc of how genuine the viewing experience feels, most ppl will be able relate to the movie.  Lastly, I totally think Scar Jo deserved the Oscar for best actress.  She totally hits it out of the park.  And it's such an \"Oscar\" role too.  I'm a big fan of hers so I was a bit perturbed when she didn't win.  So that's my take for the day... Oscars suck and Marriage Story rocks.  I definitely recommend watching this movie whether you're single, married, going through a break up, or married for > 50 years.  This movie is for everybody.  I'm a horror addict, so if this movie appealed to me, it can appeal to anyone.",

I thought the acting was pretty terrible--Driver's especially. Maybe it's because all I see when I look at him is Kylo Ren or maybe it's because monotonous villainy encompasses the entire spectrum of his acting ability? In any case, that big fight scene where they're yelling back and forth made me laugh because of how ridiculous it was--not believable and not as \"real\" as the movie attempts to portray their relationship. Not to mention Driver looks like he's seriously struggling to make himself cry. It was depressing from start to finish, and Driver's affair made me unable to empathize with him at all; despite Johansson's character flaws, his deception and betrayal were undeserved, and I couldn't see past those aspects once they were brought to light. Dern was the exact same character she played in Big Little Lies, so her performance wasn't impressive in the least. The custody battle was engaging, but Johansson's case didn't seem to hold water for me, which made the drama all the more forced. Since when is it acceptable to move across the country with your child and enroll them in school in a different state during a custody battle? I don't know much about custody law, but I'm pretty sure that's not customary. Lastly, the 2.5-hr run time dragged on for what felt like an eternity. I've seen movies that portray a real-life strained marriage much more effectively that weren't anywhere close to receiving Oscar nominations, so I'm not sure why this one made the cut.",

Scarlett's character said he was a great Dad but she did everything she could to make it hard for him to spend time with his son during the separation time. He was treated like such an outsider. So alone. It just didn't appeal to me. I kept hoping they would stop the nonsense and work on saving their marriage.",

            "content": "I think the first film I remember crying at was Kramer v Kramer; I don't know how old I was, but I remember being in the same room as it when the TV was showing it one Christmas. I don't think I fully understood it - but I know what stayed with me so powerfully was the way I sensed it articulating something of my own fear of my own parents splitting up. Not that I ever had any reason to think that would happen - it didn't. But I remember the fear. \n\nMany years and 20 years of my own marriage later, Marriage Story doesn't evoke the same fear, but it does evoke both a kind of sadness as to the way it portrays what so many go through, a kind of recognition of the sort of slow escalations that all of us experience in almost any sort of relationship. It's the simple - yet complex - story of a couple's marriage in breakdown ... they start in couple's counselling and ends in divorce, following the negotiation of the details along the way. \n\nIt seems odd to cast the film among the performance industry - he is a theatre director, she an actress; at times that's in danger of tipping the film into the sort of conflicts most of us don't have to deal with, but in the end there's enough truth there to make this feel like an 'everyman' sort of relationship.\n\nThe whole film hints occasionally at the heightened realities of musicals - the framing, the tight close-ups and tracking shots following the long speeches of one or the other, maybe even the colour palette at times suggesting the 1950s/60s musicals golden era. When Adam Driver's character, near the film's end, sings a Sondheim song in a bar, that sense is bought closer to the heart; like musicals, the film is unashamed in trying to move us and does so.\n\nMuch of this is quite remarkable - Adam Driver and Scarlett Johansson are outstanding, both of them simultaneously sympathetic and repellant, highlighting the reality that the film doesn't force us to choose one side or the other; or if it does, the way we jump is down to our own biased, not the film's. The film's standout moment, an argument that starts amicably and ends in words that can't be unsaid, is the sort of sequence you feel as if you're privy to someone else's private pain, laundry that should only aired in private hung out for all to see. It's remarkable in performance, direction and writing - and everything else besides. \n\nThe film also mines comedy out of some of the most painful situations; the moment Adam Driver's character is served with divorce papers is almost farce-like in its execution, yet the tonal shift within the scene never jars. Much within the film is funny, because people are funny; there's always a hint of joy, even in the midst of great pain. \n\nThis, I think, is where the hope in the film comes from; given where we are almost certain the film will end right from the first scene, the light touches of humour and the moments of clarity amidst the recriminations, claims and counterclaims point us to the human capacity to be better versions of ourselves even when so much seems to be falling around us. Like the best films, it's never one thing entirely - it's a love story about a divorce, a drama with very good jokes and comedic scenes, a musical with only one song. It's a film about one particular relationship, that allows us to see every relationship (not just marital ones)  in a fresh light.",

        {
            "content": "Despite its annoyingly vague title, Marriage Story is actually about a divorce. On one level writer-director Noah Baumbach's latest film feels like a divorce procedural. We follow a young attractive couple (Scarlett Johansson and Adam Driver) as they agree to keep things simple and not involve lawyers, then involve lawyers, begin a custody battle, and try to navigate all of the emotional and legal complexities of legally dissolving a marriage. On another level, Marriage Story is a showcase of brilliant performances ranging from subtle to ostentatious, comical to moving. I enjoyed Marriage Story far more than I expected though I hesitate to recommend it since very few people (myself included) are able to have a good time by watching people argue and get divorced for over two hours. The divorce gets rocky but the film doesn't so much and if you are in the right mood for a relationship/divorce drama you'll find a decent, somehow, feel good movie.\n\nThis is the kind of movie that hangs entirely on its performances. Fortunately, the leads and supporting players all turn in strong performances. Scarlett Johansson and Adam Driver have both earned Oscar nominations for their performances as the wife and husband seeking to uncouple themselves while remaining involved with their eight-year-old son and maintaining their careers. Both earn and lose and then earn back your sympathy. Charlie (Driver) is a successful New York theater director whose latest avant-garde production is headed to Broadway. Nicole (Johansson) once starred in a popular Hollywood movie but since meeting and marrying Charlie has committed herself to the stage. A Los Angeles native, Nicole has always wanted to spend more time on the West Coast and now has landed a role in a pilot that will likely become a series. Charlie thinks of them as a New York family and expects Nicole and their son to move back to New York once the pilot is done. When Nicole decides to officially file for divorce the real conflict between them begins.\n\nBaumbach's script does not overtly take sides though it leans toward Charlie, especially toward the end of the film. The explosive climatic argument between Nicole and Charlie gives a chance for both actors to express intense emotions, but it is Driver who gets to let out overwhelming pathos. A court appointed observer\u2014played with welcome awkward comic deadpan by Martha Kelly\u2014is assigned to visit and interview both parents, but we only see the visit Charlie. Charlie does his best to present as an ideal father before the visit falls into dark comedy. In a wonderfully delivered monologue early in the film, Nicole gives us her backstory, both life events and emotional. After this scene the perspective shifts to Charlie and never really shifts back to Nicole. We are as blindsided as Charlie is by claims on money and custody by Nicole's lawyer.\n\nNora, Nicole's flashy and smoothly confident high-powered lawyer, is played with impressive ease by Laura Dern, who has earned a Best Supporting Actress nomination. We're just as charmed and dazzled by her as Nicole, and just as stung by her as Charlie. Alan Alda delivers some great low-key comedy as Charlie's first divorce lawyer. He's old enough that his hands shake but also old enough to know how bad a divorce can get, and how it will likely end, so, he recommends just starting there. On the complete opposite end of the spectrum is Ray Liotta as Charlie second divorce lawyer, a high powered and extremely expensive pit-bull. He speaks with such speed and ridiculous intensity that he can't help but be funny and believable as a ruthless lawyer. Julie Hagerty is a welcome presence as Nicole's actress mother. She has so much flighty warmth that she secretly helps Charlie find a divorce lawyer.\n\nI'm sure certain viewers that have been through a divorce or even a bad breakup will find something relatable with the characters and situation in Marriage Story. I wouldn't be surprised if other viewers find these characters and their situation unrelatable. Nicole and Charlie, though not wealthy, are in a very upper middle class bracket. They are so accomplished that momentous life changing events like landing a starring role in a TV show and earning an Emmy nomination for directing (Nicole) and winning a MacArthur \"genius\" grant (Charlie) are just background plot points. Whether you can relate or not, the performances from Scarlett Johansson and Adam Driver are of such a rare quality as to keep you invested in their emotional journey.",

Because of this, I have no idea which of the 8 contestants will win Best Picture. I know that Ford Vs Ferrari doesn't stand a chance, that Jojo Rabbit was probably nominated out of pity, and that Joker is a long shot. Honestly, if it were up to me, none of the nominees would win. Not a single one of my four favorite films of this year were nominated. Dark Waters, Knives Out, Harriet and Avengers: Endgame all missed the boat. However, if I had to choose which one of the actual Oscar nominees would win, I would, without a moment's reflection, choose Marriage Story. The reason this movie is great is because it doesn't actually feel like a movie. Every second of this movie feels like it's actually happening. This is, in part, because of the actors. Adam Driver and Scarlett Johansson both give perfect performances. Nothing they do feels faked or scripted. There is a scene early on in the movie where Johansson's character has a monologue directed at Laura Dern's character, and it's so well done, it doesn't even feel like a monologue; it feels like a real person, not a character, speaking her mind. Every actor and actress in this movie feels like they are really there, thinking the things they are saying, from the two leads, to the supporting cast (especially Laura Dern), all the way down to seemingly irrelevant featured characters (such as Jazmine Cephas Jones and Martha Kelly's characters). There are several songs performed in the film, and to an outsider, they may seem underperformed or unprofessional. However, that's what makes them work. They aren't being done to wow the audience, they are being done to show that these characters are basically real people, with talents, but also flaws. This is a wonderful film with great performances, great writing and just a general sense of greatness overall.",

And yet, through the gloom and rising anxiety, Baumbach always preserves the heart of the moment, fleshing out the struggle of legal and emotional separation.\n\nThe film stars Scarlett Johansson and Adam Driver. Laura Dern, Alan Alda, and Ray Liotta co-star.\n\nJohansson locates surprising areas of honesty for the character, working wonderfully with Baumbach's observant screenplay. Johansson plays an interesting foil, so long in the shadow of her high-profile husband despite being the face of his success in many ways. You can see the pain on her face, but it slowly turns defiant as she discovers a new life and a new (or perhaps rediscovered) sense of self in California. Her performance is Sublime.\n\nDriver has grown into one of the most respected actors of his generation a fearless and magnetic screen presence capable of making you believe everything he's saying no matter the context. He spends much of the film in a bemused haze as their divorce proceedings turn from civil to contentious, unable to understand how things went so sour despite his role in fracturing their relationship. It's the sort of skillful and soulful performance that's expected of him now, and he doesn't disappoint. Their chemistry is undeniable, and their performances sell the emotion of the script with ease.\n\nWhile Driver and Johansson take up most of the space in the room, there's still enough oxygen for some fun and quirky supporting turns, be it Wallace Shawn's unfathomably horny thespian or Merritt Wever and Julie Hagerty as Nicole's sister and mother, respectively. But it's Dern, decked out in slinky, aggressive power dresses and extreme heels, who effortlessly steals the movie away whenever she enters a scene. She has great fun sparring with Liotta and Alan Alda (as a grandfatherly and mostly inept lawyer who may not be up for the job. \"Marriage Story\" is all about its performances, and those performances are flawless in every sense of the term.\n\n\"Marriage Story\" manages to come out on the other side with a sense of calm and understanding, making an extraordinarily difficult viewing experience worth the pain to see how people can keep living even when life is determined to beat all the spirit out of you. The result is a near-perfect piece of transcendent art and one of the true standouts of 2019. 9.5/10",

            "content": "One of the year's best and most balanced movies, Marriage Story succeeds at being both laugh-out-loud funny and heartbreakingly sad. Here, Noah Baumbach shines in his very human and authentic depiction of two genuinely good - if flawed - people trying to navigate their way through an increasingly turbulent divorce. It seems apparent there's an autobiographical element to the movie: Noah began conceiving the film just a few years after his divorce from actress Jennifer Jason Leigh. According to the director himself, his ex wife likes the film a lot. His compassionate and empathic depiction of Nicole is noteworthy. \n\nMarriage Story feels like it could come straight from Woody Allen's oeuvre. Annie Hall comes closest, I think. But that's probably partly down to switching back and forth between NYC and LA. But watching Noah Baumbach's latest, one is most obviously reminded of Kramer vs Kramer. It's a testament to Marriage Story, then, that after watching it, Kramer vs Kramer feels dated (in fairness, it is forty years old) and Marriage Story feels superior. \n\nThe film vilifies neither Nicole nor Charlie; instead, showing them as victims: victims of an unfair and outdated legal system that cruelly plays both parents off against one another. Insidiously, it strips those fighting for custody of their money, thus creating a desperate situation. The movie illustrates the ensuing escalating tensions through the increasingly unhealthy interaction between the two protagonists, which moves from strained, to quarrelsome, to full-on noxious. But Noah's script is punctuated with humorous and lighthearted moments to balance out the darkest parts.\n\nBoth actors are amazing throughout, and so deserving of the accolades they're receiving. But Driver is phenomenal. He elicits real emotion from the viewer, especially in those scenes with his son, which see him try ever so hard to win over his kid's approval. In one stand-out scene, Charlie grabs the microphone and sings Being Alive. It's incredibly engaging, and revealing, too. In another stand-out scene, he finds the notes of his wife, a list of all his greatest qualities, which she had previously refused to share with him. It's beautifully devastating, and Driver communicates the bittersweetness of this simply and powerfully. It's this scene echoes the movie's vibe: hopeful and redemptive even in despairing times.",

And the performance of Adam Driver was exceptional, once again. The songs at the end were a sweet touch and I found them personally challenging; Is it really better to have loved and lost than to never have loved at all? I suspect the filmmaker was just trying to find a positive in his grim situation by claiming, 'well, at least I really lived'.

It's also a supremely well-executed artistic experience on a structural, dramatic, thematic, and technical level. It's rare to have a film operate so meticulously in its characterization process, yet remain so fascinating and emotionally impressive. In many other films, you'd label it a potential issue to have your average scene length be somewhere between 7-10 minutes, and to have most of those scenes involve characters simply talking to one another. But these are very carefully constructed moments of build-up, allowing the audience to breathe these characters in and empathize with every action taken and word spoken, no matter how hurtful or diabolical it may seem on the surface. At the end of the proverbial day, we find we're dealing with nuanced human beings trying desperately to navigate their respective ways through a tragic phase of existence (a kind of death, as the movie so aptly puts it). It's sad, heartwarming, brilliant, and earnest -- an experience I know I'll carry with me for some time.",

While it isn't my favorite movie of the year, I'd definitely recommend it.\n\nAs a start, the acting in this was some of the best I've seen in a while, personally, Adam Driver's performance was a huge stand-out. I think Adam Driver did alright in the Star Wars franchise, but this really helps me see him as a really good actor. On the note of great acting, I'd also like to point out Laura Dern's performance as the lawyer, which was also a notably good performance. Another strong component to this movie was the screenplay, Laura Dern's story about reading the script for the first time really sums it up. Baumbach used a great progression to convey the way the characters felt without simply stating it.\n\nOn the other hand, I had a few issues with the movie. I felt that there were certain unresolved threads. For example, this is getting into some light spoilers, the punch in the wall was hardly brought up again. There were a few other things that were never brought up. Another complaint for me would be some of the cuts the movie makes. I also felt that certain comedic bits were misplaced. Other than those complaints, this movie is great.\n\nIn retrospect, this movie is one of the best of 2019. Adam Driver's performance was a stand-out. While I know the Oscar will go to Phoenix for the Joker, I hope Adam Driver gets recognition for his performance in this. The movie's use of emotion kept me invested until the very end. I'd give this a solid 3.75/5",

It's composed by Randy Newman and sounds right out of a Pixar movie. Wallace Shawn of The Incredibles and Toy Story fame is even in it.

While the pacing of this movie is near perfect thanks to its incredibly engaging story the way our two lead characters are written have some problems. I was expecting that both characters were going to be equally flawed and responsible for the destruction of their marriage. This would have made for a more compelling narrative however Adam Driver's character is less sympathetic and more of an idiot which makes me feel not as sorry when the relationship ultimately falls apart. 7/10",

            "content": "This film... No film in recent memory has taken me through such a vast array of emotions while being utterly captivated by its perfection. That's right, I said perfection. 'Marriage Story' is an exceptionally beautiful, raw, and realistic look at the highs and low of a marriage; as well as the immense toll divorce it takes on the participating individuals, whether it be financially, mentally, etc. The performances by the actors and their characters are phenomenal. Scarlet Johansson and really every cast member is fantastic, although it was Adam Driver that outright blew me away. He gave the performance of his entire career thus far, and easily the best performance of 2019 and possibly 2020 (we'll see). Everyone in the film is simply faultless, the actors and actresses disappear and all that is left is real people that you feel you are watching. The story is simple and yet powerful, and the script is a masterful blend of realism and gritty emotion. Throughout this entire experience I felt everything from warmth and laughter, to frustration and sadness. I was simply hypnotized by the film from the start. The casting, performances, plot, cinematography, score, it was all-too immaculate. There were even several moments within this film that almost had me tearing up, and that has almost never happens to me when watching a movie. There is an argument scene within this movie, and wow... All I have to say, wow... I don't know what else to say. Hop on Netflix, turn off your phone, and watch this film. If you don't have Netflix, start a free trial. Just watch this movie.\n10/10",

Actress who, in a period of burnout, leaves her L.A. life and moves to New York where she meets, works with, and eventually marries Charlie.\n\nNarration starts the story, where the two characters describe all that they love about each other while we see examples of those words depicted on screen. We then come to find that these \"narrations\" are actually the written words each has been asked to write about each other as they begin the process of divorce.  A beautifully well crafted and concise way of introducing the characters, establishing their love for each other, and why they married without delaying the main focus of the story... the pains of divorce.\n\nCharlie and Nicole wish to end things as peacefully as possible. However, self-interest (or perhaps a bit of self-preservation) for the lives each wish to live beyond marriage interfere with those goals. The process of divorce, particularly when custody of a child is involved, picks at the wounds that led to the divorce, making it easier to forget what people may have once loved about each other.\n\nMost divorces are a result of paths going in different directions, realizations of things that you may not have seen during the infancy of a relationship. Careers, ambition, feelings of self-worth... they all come into play and are depicted as fuel for the gradual demise of their relationship.\n\nNow, enter the many vultures that surround these two looking to divorce. Divorce attorneys that you almost feel have developed their approaches or styles, perhaps based on some bad divorce they, themselves, had gone through. They do not always seem to have their client's best interests in mind. Their aim to score the win for their client simply fans the fires of pain that may already be encircling the soon to be ex-couple.\n\nWithout going further into plot, the biggest success of this film is how each character is a sympathetic character but at the same time, guilty of sins that may have led to current events, signifying there is no ALL Good or ALL bad... no main villain.. but simply two people whose paths intersected at one point, met each other's needs for a time, then ultimately drifted in different directions.\n\nAt the center of all of this is their son, who clearly loves both mother and father, who has some connection issues due to distances between father and son, both geographically and emotionally. But through it all, the son serves as catalyst for the rising contentiousness of the interaction between mother and father as they fight for custody.\nAll told, the story progresses to a moment that showcases some of the best acting I've seen from BOTH actors to date.\n\nI would love to comment on the ending but I hesitate, not because of spoilers, but because I almost feel that the uncertainty of how it ends is part of what gives the ending a satisfying feeling.\n\nNot since Kramer vs Kramer has a film about divorce given such a painfully earnest look at divorce. Fair, yet honest, and, at times, emotionally gut wrenching look into divorce. This movie is a must see.",

I'm not even the product of a married one. Everyone I know who has gotten married or had kids did it before I met them, or stopped hanging out with me almost immediately afterward. Everyone I've ever met who got divorced either did it before I met them, or is someone I stopped hanging out with beforehand. So I don't come to the subject of Marraige Story with a wealth of experience, which means it doesn't exactly scream \"relatable content\" to me. \n\nLet me start where it's easiest and everyone seems to agree: The performances. Everyone in Marriage Story is pretty great, none of the characterisations changed my life, but I get it. As a chance to display what these actors are capable of in a mundane setting where all that matters is their performance, yes, absolutely, Marriage Story has buckets of success. \n\nOutside of this though... I'm not even going to say that it \"fails\" elsewhere, just that it didn't win me. I like bleak movies, I like movies that make me feel something, even if it's sad. But Marriage Story isn't really that. It poses you the question of whether both Charlie and Nicole are good or bad people, and shows you each from their own and other's perspective. The ending seems to imply that they're good, or at the very least both good and bad (and aren't we all?) but that really doesn't matter very much when we just spent all this time watching both of them be horrible. I know that's life, that's real, that's people, and blah bl-blah bl-blah, but that's little consolation when I've just spent two-plus hours of my life being not at all compelled by a bunch of people being awful. Being awful convincingly, to the actors' respective credits, but in this setting that is not my idea of a good time at the movies.",

I never felt particularly emotional as I watched it, possibly because my own past was preventing me from doing so.\n\nThat being said, I can not deny that Marriage Story is a true achievement of film making. The courage and self-reflection that Baumbach displayed by telling us the story of his own divorce is remarkable and commendable. Perhaps this is most prevalent in the exquisite screenplay. From the opening scene through the final moments, every line of dialogue feels so cleverly written, yet also completely genuine, as if they are real conversations one might overhear at a coffee shop. The predicaments that the characters find themselves in are heart wrenching, or can become so with a single line that hits the viewer straight in the heart. It tells the story in satisfying ways when needed, and uncomfortable ways when necessary, and these moments transition seamlessly.\n\nThe exceptional script would be a waste without an all-star cast, and this movie had talent to spare. The cast is led by Adam Driver and Scarlett Johansson in the lead roles. The chemistry (and intentional lack thereof) between the two is among the strongest and most genuine I have ever seen. Driver excels in his role by bringing realism and likability to a character which the script sometimes depicts as selfish and cold. The audience is convinced that this is an authentic, loving father who struggles to adapt when his world turns upside down. Johansson is excellent as the mother; She delivers as the strong, caring mother when with her son, but below the surface, plays the part of a talented artist being trapped and held back, desperate to \"find a piece of earth that's hers\". \n\nThe ensemble deserves much praise, but the standout is Laura Dern, playing the part of Johannson's divorce attorney. Dern puts on a clinic in \"tactics\", an acting term referring to the methods characters use to get what they want out of others. The way she manipulates her clients is subtle enough to be mistaken as friendliness, but strong enough to be effective. \n\nOn a technical level, the film's technique is misleadingly simple and plain. The editing, production design, and cinematography don't draw any attention to themselves, but dance together to create a seamless flow to the narrative. Much acclaim goes to Randy Newman's score, which is the lifeblood of several key scenes. \n\nAs mentioned, my biggest disappointment in the film was that i wasn't brought anywhere near to tears, though I wanted to be. I suppose that this can be chalked up to my personal horrid experience with divorce. Even though it didn't strike many chords with me, I appreciate the craftsmanship that went into it and look forward to future works by this director.\n\n7/10.",

This tells the story of a relatively average couple who even though they still have love for each other they just don't know how they can stay together and stay themselves. The acting amazing. Some of the best work I have ever seen Scarlett Johansson do. Adam Driver killed it as well. The direction makes the experience feel even more reapl and when they argue the tension radiates off the screen as if you are in the room with them. Absolutely excellent, no complaints.",

            "content": "'Marriage Story' is written and directed by Noah Baumbach, depicting the divorce of Charlie and Nicole, and showing the inhumane nature of the judiciary system and how it affects their relationship. This film is well written by Baumbach, with the opening scene taking the audience on an unexpected turn, which keeps us on edge for the rest of the film. In his writing and directing Baumbach shows us the hostile nature of the corporate lawyer's world and the toxic effect it has on Charlie and Nicole's relationship, although they are getting divorced, they are by no means on bad terms. Comedy is also excellently weaved into the movie, and not shot or acted in a way that make it over the top. In Charlie and Nicole's argument scene, some lines didn't feel like they suited the character and situation, which in turn lead to overacting, and one character was dull, for comedic effect, however was so overly dull you couldn't buy into it. The cinematography in this film, done by Robbie Ryan and the editing, done by Jennifer Lame, place a lot of focus on shots of only one actor, which does a great job at showing the characters emotions and bringing the intensity to a scene, however, at times it can become a headache for the audience, cutting to and fro from Charlie and Nicole, where a different shot used could still encapture the same intensity and atmosphere to the scene. This film was excellently acted, with Scarlett Johansson (Nicole) and Adam Driver (Charlie) both playing their roles excellently well, with as mentioned before only one moment in the film being slightly overacted. The acting means we never take one side throughout the film as we empathise with both characters which creates a moral dilemma to those audience as to who to agree with and who not, which brilliantly points out that just because two people are divorcing, it isn't necessarily one person's fault. Overall, this film is well worth watching, a really well directed and acted drama with moments of comedy, with the whole film showcasing perfectly the unnecessary wedge being driven between these characters because of how society perceives divorce should happen.",

            "content": "What can I say? Just... Wow... That is as real as cinema gets.\n\nOkay first off, I started watching it without knowing anything about the characters, the setting or any other detail. I hadn't even seen the trailer for it. So when I understood both of them, Johansson and Driver respectively, were a stage actor and a director I was a little bit let down because I thought this was a more \"down to earth\" kind of a story and not one of the high life of New York and LA. I was surprised that this factor did not affect the story that much or almost at all.\n\nSo in some short words - the movie is at times lighthearted but is mostly one really riveting and heart wrenching story from start to finish. It starts off pretty light with some warm and even funny moments but when it actually gets going stuff goes down so hard you cannot control yourself and start feeling empathetic towards both the characters no matter who you have chosen to side with for the time being. \n\nThe whole direction, the writing, the actors' work makes it so easy for you to feel the same amount of pain as the person you are seeing onscreen. The movie is truly that powerful. By the time you are done with the movie you will be left with this bittersweet taste in your mouth and the feeling that you went through this whole family ordeal yourself. \n\nBut the thing is that only mentioning Driver's and Johansson's performances dos not simply cut it, it does not give them enough credit. I can see that I have seen them in different roles here and there but together in this is something else entirely. This might be just a bit of an overstatement but for me both of those great actors give a career best performance.\n\nSo in other and a bit simpler words, that's what I think makes the movie one of a kind - a story and a premise so simple and yet one that makes you feel as if you were the person in front of the camera. Just a bit funny and filled with all these bittersweet moments that we all know so well from our own lives, the movie is the most \"real\" flick I have seen in recent memory.",

The poor dad gets railroaded (as usual) while the mother acted like she was not going to make a big deal out of the divorce. Overall it was just cringe, and showed how little upper middle class Hollywood types fight for their marriages. It now makes sense why so many ppl in LA have multiple marriages.

There are scenes that go on and on with just talking that are way to long. Secondly there is a major tonal issue. The movie jumps between very serious and Rom-com. Which got really annoying. The scenes with the lawyers , while very funny took away from the serious nature of the film. Lastly, I could not understand why this couple was getting a divorce. They clearly loved each other but their issue were so minor. I was left scratching my head as to why they were not together anymore. I didn't make any sense to me. Also why did Laura Dern win a golden globe for this? A huge letdown. I just don't get this one.",

Noah Baumbach's talent as a director as well as Adam Driver and Scarlett Johansson's incredible acting ability created one of the best argument scenes in cinema history, the 4 minutes long take showing the decline of Adam Driver's characters showed pure emotion and almost heartbreak towards the audience.

I love that Charlie went back to his first attorney, Jay (Ray Liotta), when he decided to neglect Bert's (Alan Alda's) advice to his detriment. The courtroom scene showcases the hyper-combative nature of Family Court that too many experience in their lifetime. Lastly, the court-appointed evaluator (Martha Kelly) is electric (probably not the best adjective) with her awkwardness. Marriage Story is a film that doesn't offer anything new in terms of plot, but is so well-acted and engaging that anything less than a (90) wouldn't do it justice.",

To be fair, it was 4 am and I wasn't feeling the best mentally when I watched it, but still. As a sucker for just about any rom-com, I was cautious of this film simply because I knew it wasn't going to have a happily-ever-after at the end. In spite of that,  I reccomend this particular movie to anyone who needs a good cry or a good think. I stayed up for at least an hour after finishing the movie, just replaying each of the scenes in my head, examining everything, from the physical take to the stunning dialogue between the characters. I think that's what so excellent about this movie; there aren't any \"throw-away\" scenes. Every scene in the movie must be there or it wouldn't tell the same story. Adam Driver talked about this phenomenon in an interview he did on a press tour for the release of Marriage Story. He said that every scene in this movie required his utmost focus and care when performing and he couldn't \"space out\" on any of them or the movie wouldn't be complete. I believe it. This film is rife with metaphor, subtle and not too subtle with the perfect blend of joyous and heart-wrenching moments.\n\nMad props to Adam Driver and ScarJo for their acting in this film (I personally think it's their best work thus far); their on-screen chemistry sold audiences on their deep love and respect for the other, despite their failing marriage. The very nature of the characters in Marriage Story, Charlie and Nicole (director and actress respectively), lend themselves perfectly to Driver and Johansson because of their careers and the industry they belong to: Hollywood. Their careers end up as the ultimate downfall of their relationship, shedding some light on why so many Hollywood marriages seem to end just about as quickly as they started. If I had to choose a favorite scene from the entire film as a whole without spoiling, it would have to be the opening scenes. The beginning scenes for each character (Charlie and Nicole) parallel each other elegantly, while setting up the story that will soon follow. The voice over is reminiscent of 80's teen dramas and I adore it. The cinematography alone will amaze you not to mention the moods that Baumbach can create with just a lingering shot. The emotions you feel will run the gamut of second-hand embarrassment to straight-up rage, all developed through those elements of film. It's a cinematic masterpiece. \n\nAll I can say after this ENTIRE rant about how much I love this movie is please watch it. I couldn't ask for anything more than to give this amazing film 136 minutes of your life. You won't regret it.",

Now that I've wiped my tears away, it's time to discuss Marriage Story.  This is the story of a married couple that is going through a divorce, but not wanting to put the stress on their young son, they try to stick together as a family while going through a long legal process to finalize their divorce. \nThis film was about as perfect as you can get when it comes to telling this type of story, and it's packed with two of the best performances I have ever seen. Adam Driver and Scarlett Johansson are the best they have ever been and have my votes in the upcoming Oscars for best actor and actress respectively. The only one that can rival Driver is Phoenix which I probably will still ever so slightly side with. Having witness my parents go through a divorce, this movie effected me personally on a deep level. By far the biggest strength of this film is in the screenplay and story, how it's not about the arguing, but how it just destroys a family. Mentally, financially, and in other ways its hard to explain. There were a couple of moments in this film where I was just losing it with tears and again that lies in the performances. They are pitch perfect. THE argument scene was some of the best acting I've ever witnessed in my life. Hearing these characters pour out this heartbreaking dialogue just killed me in a way. The music was so simple and so sad at the same time. I cannot stress enough how much I was impressed by the acting in this movie it's truly mesmerizing. So many extremely long takes of dialogue and the dialogue is not only heartbreaking to listen to, seeing these actors not break character while delivering them is the best part. The ending of this film took me back to the beginning of it and had a big what if scenario in my head. That perhaps was the most heartbreaking part about it, and that goes with the writing and the screenplay. So many people have Netflix today and they better not pass on this one. I really can't find a single flaw with this movie, I honestly can't. This movie took me on an emotional journey I won't soon forget, and Marriage Story ABSOLUTELY gets an A+",

The story itself not only taught me a lot of things I didn't know about divorce, but it gave me a deeply personal look into what it's like. The characters in this movie didn't seem like characters, but real people that we were watching the lives of. Everything about the story to the conversations between characters was deeply human and can connect with just about anyone, even if you've never been through a divorce. It made me cry at least twice, and I came close to crying a whole lot. The only few issues I have with it is that the score doesn't really suit my tastes. I don't know what it is, I just don't feel like it suits the movie, and maybe it could've had a better impact with a better score. And despite the amazing performances, there were a few lines in the movie that made me remember I was watching a movie, they felt a bit forced, but I was pulled right back in after a few hiccups.

Scarlett Johansson delivering her second amazing performance of the year and the oddly  sexy and powerful Adam Driver delivers a career high performance as her husband. Theres also a fine cast of supporting performances from Laura Dern and Ray Liotta amongst others. It's a truly powerful and realistic examination of the material that's explored in such a way that it resonates with you long after it's over from the powerful arguments to the subtle touches.

I certainly learnt something.  Both Scarlett Johansson and Adam Driver are at their best, despite a certain lack of personal chemistry, which in the context, oddly, helps.

This view into a divorce of a marriage that felt real and felt believable, a divorce not stemming from abuse or absence but from a loss of purpose. The two actors Adam Driver and Scarlett Johnson are absolutely phenomenal and give you a sense that you are going through this time with them. Their relationship is maintained and feels consistent throughout the film although the obvious tearing of the marriage that binds them. Through the film you learn the hardships of the relationship from both sides the mental toll from the marriage and from the split, the moments where both people messed up and where they succeeded. Comedy plays an important role within the movie not only so the movie doesn't drag your emotions too deep but to show how both characters use it as a median to the bad and good. It proves that a sense of humor is human and a path to get through what you may not think you can. The movie does a wonderful job at providing everything you need to see clearly that neither party is the fault of the marriage but the marriage itself. Both Nichole and Charlie are great parents to their kid Henry and share a love for him that is the same love they have for each other, which plays into the story beautifully. The movie starts and ends with the same thing which is positive and very touching. Both Charlie and Nichole are seen pushed to their breaking point, both cracking open and bouncing back within the film making you feel for them as if they are real. Although I do not have any direct view into the world of a divorce it teaches you how horrible it is but how peaceful it can be afterwards. The ending is redeeming and shows how a divorce can better a relationship rather than destroy it. Wonderful movie, absolutely one of Netflix's best so far and justifies itself for many awards.",

That was the worst acting job I have ever seen, by anyone, ever.  The two \"musical\" numbers should have been cut because they were truly awful.  This movie missed the mark on so many things.  Everything seemed so superficial and the dialogue was overwritten.  This could have been a great movie if it had been told from \"truth\" instead of from a \"they were just so darn nice to each other\" place.  This movie shouldn't have been called \"Marriage Story\" because it didn't really show us anything real about their marriage.  It should have been called \"A Pretty Nice and Civil Divorce Story Between Friends\".   I did think that Adam Driver's acting was excellent and so was Alan Alda's.  I just think the writing needed a lot of work to make it a more intense and believable story.

This is a relatable movie particularly for more recent generations of viewers who are likely to be able to project their own experiences of  divorce, separations, being the subject of split custody as children, etc. onto the main plot line. Scarlett Johansson fully embodies a character more complex than she's often been given in the past and Adam Driver proves he has what it takes to be a \"leading man\" in a dramatic film.

But after watching this movie, it makes me feel like I have gone through the entire struggling, painful process. There are no dramas throughout the movie, rather, all the stories sounds real, normal and could happen to any married couple that are trying to get divorced.\nTime is always cruel and powerful: It can set apart a couple, who used to love each other deeply and exclusively, and now make them fight against each other, (with the help of each's lawyer) , for money, assets and custody of children. All these changes don't take too long \u2014 just in few years. \nIn the movie, Charlie (the husband) and Nicole ( the wife) had a very intensive fight for over 15 minutes, I was impressed by how angry, unsatisfied, nagging they were. Those negative emotion, that had been suppressed and controlled for years had finally exploded and became devastating. They used the most harsh words to hurt each other. The husband even said he wanted the wife to die. Not surprisingly, they finally divorced. But I was very sad about the ending of the story. They could have had a happy family, watching their kid grow up together, but they terminated it because of disputes on chores and small things in lives. Had they communicated their negative emotion timely and thoroughly whenever the issue arose, and weren't leave it accumulated, a divorce can be avoided.\nBut it was too late to say this. Nicole had already started her new life in LA with her boyfriend. A divorce was already a divorce, nothing can get back. \nWhat I've learned is: life won't give you a chance to regret, and move backward. A broken heart will never be healed completely. You have to move on to embrace your new life, And let the past be an unforgettable memory. \nI highly recommend this movie, because it gives you a good chance to rethink about marriage, life and divorce.",

They're great throughout the whole film, but there is a certain scene in this movie that everybody will talk about and it floored me. They way they act towards each other, they have great chemistry. Laura Dern also did a great job, playing a slimeball lawyer who keeps taking Johansson's character into things she doesn't want to do.\nThe real hero of this story however is Noah Baumbach, who also wrote the film and deserves all the praise. He is a true master in writing and directing. He makes all of it seem effortless, with unprecedented results. He could truly be one of the last true story tellers working today.\nOverall, the movie to me is basically flawless. It makes you laugh; it makes you cry; it even makes you feel things you can't identify. It's a heartbreaking story about how two people can love each other, but still know they aren't good for each other.\n5/5",

Baumbach's script is a revelation (and a likely Oscar nominee or winner), but so are the powerful performances by Scarlett Johansson and Adam Driver, both at their best, whose characters we alternately root for or despise as if we are breaking up with each of them ourselves. That fight scene! That show tune scene! Laura Dern and Alan Alda make the most of well-crafted parts as lawyers, one a shark (Dern, uncomfortably close to her work on \"Big Little Lies\" from 2017-present) and one a confoundingly laissez-faire pushover (Alda) ... or is that wisdom? Do not sleep on the work by Julie Hagerty as a mom who refuses to choose sides and Ray Liotta as a counselor who swims in the same school as Dern's character. If the mounting backlash to the film doesn't damage it, it could sweep the major categories at the Oscars in February. P.S. If you missed Baumbach's \"The Meyerowitz Stories\" (2017), as I did until recently ... it's even better.",

While Adam Driver and Scarlett Johansson's characters are really the optimal parents for a child (kind, playful, engaged and involved), the story isn't saccharine or trite. It reminds us what it is to be cast in the most negative light - to be seen at our worst- and then reminds us of the importance of love and why love, even waning love, is never futile. Experiences, even negative ones, can teach us lessons about who we are and what is important.\n\nIf I had any complaint about this film, it would be its chosen scope. While the emotion and arc of the story is universal, it would be nice to see a movie stripped of the privilege of wealth. These are two people who can afford costly lawyers and transcontinental flights every few weeks. The writers and producers lost the opportunity to show how divorce affects those who don't have the money and social standing these characters enjoy. The average salary in the United States is $47,000. It would be interesting for the writers to create a film with the same emotions while the divorcing couple figure out how to live separately within those financial constraints.

It's a poignant, true-to-life drama about two utterly believable (if not so sympathetic) characters that more than a fair share of the population will relate to, whether they are willing to admit it or not. \u00a0But it did not affect me in the way some other movies with similar subjects have.  A more apt title for this film would have been \"Divorce Story\" \u2013 it's more about the grueling legal process of a contentious divorce and custody battle than the marriage that led up to it.  It's often uncomfortable to watch; the emotion it evokes is anger more than empathy, watching what that process can do to two otherwise reasonable people that care about each other.  The movie does a good job of showing both characters' viewpoints and bringing you along on their journeys, so you feel like you are going through it all with them.  Both characters are flawed and are hard to root for, but that was the intent \u2013 marriage is messy and divorce is a goddamn disaster, even for the best of people.  The film just didn't make me care much for either of them until I was pretty deep into it, when all the tension that has been subtly building over the course of the film comes to a head in one explosive scene (if you've seen the film, you know the scene I mean\u2026 it's a gutter, and Driver and Johannson could not have been more convincing together).  This film is what you call an \"actor's film\" \u2013 it's focused on character and heavy on dialogue, (plus some whopper monologues), to the point where it often feels like you're watching a play.  It has all the makings of an Oscar winner:  a celebrated auteur writer/director in Noah Baumbach, two stellar actors at the top of their game, and a resonant drama at its core.  It's the kind of movie that Academy voters eat up with a spoon and it's a shoo-in for Best Picture, Best Actor/Actress, and Best Director nominations, plus a writing nomination thrown in for good measure. The only question is whether or not its affiliation with Netflix will kill its chances for the big prize come Oscar night.",

I am not a big fan of movies that focus on couples bickering a lot, because I generally seek escapism in film, and don\u2019t want to spend my time watching relationships fall apart. However, I simply couldn\u2019t bring myself to hate this movie because it is perfectly acted, has moments of levity among the sorrow, and feels so genuinely heart-wrenching in how far the relationship has fallen. We can see, as their divorce draws closer, they still retain some faint echoes of the love they once felt for each other. I\u2019m fairly confident that Noah Baumbach must have written this based on personal experience, because it is too authentic to be entirely fabricated out of nowhere (and at times the film seems to cast the wife in a more negative light than the husband.) Scarlett Johansson brings her A game here, and it\u2019s hard to deny her talent. Yet it\u2019s Adam Driver who impressed me even more, because he delivers a truly astounding performance loaded with nuance and emotion. There are some scenes in Marriage Story where so much is communicated by Driver with only looks and body language. You can feel the hurt hiding behind a casual conversation, and when it explodes, the vitriol is truly shocking. There is no denying that, for those who like a realistic relationship drama, Marriage Story might be one of the best films in years. However, while I tip my hat to the quality of the film (and commend them for making the movie that Blue Valentine wishes it could have been) it\u2019s still a style of story that is a tough sell for me. I appreciate that it exists, but I never want to watch it again.",

Marriage Story should really have been titled Divorce Story because we follow couple Charlie (Adam Driver) a theater director, and Nicole (Scarlett Johansson) an actress, who are getting a divorce. They have agreed to not use lawyers and to settle this just between themselves. They have a son named Henry (Azhy Robertson), so of course that complicates matters. Nicole lands a pilot in Los Angeles, so she decides to take Henry and move in with her mom temporarily. While in Los Angeles someone tell she should get a lawyer for the divorce, so that she doesn't get screwed over. Nicole hires Nora Fanshaw (Laura Dern) who specializes in divorce. Suddenly, Charlie is thrown into this and has to scramble to get his own lawyer. The rest of the film portrays the hard decisions of divorce and how two people that still may love each other slowly start to unravel and change. It's some pretty deep stuff here and I would say it's a great movie, but not a film I'd watch more than once because of the somewhat depressing subject matter. The two leads performances in Driver and Johansson are great here. They have some scenes together that are so realistic that it's hard to believe this was all scripted. You feel for both of their sides and I personally couldn't side with either or during it all. It's a heartbreaking film and I have my own opinions of the ending and what could be happening here, but I won't spoil it all. This is an incredibly well acted movie, but also not exactly pick me up kind of film. Definitely, recommend checking it out though on Netflix!",

This should be seen  If you need to hit the pause button go ahead. If it hits too close to home it will be cathartic.  If you don't like this film you probably don't like movies.  Wife summed things up thusly:  \" It was a difficult movie to watch which perhaps has confused me into not believing what a good film this was. I can't find fault in it, but maybe because it was so emotionally close to home for me, I could appreciate the superiority of the reality of the story. Adam Driver and Scarlett Jo gave convincing performances that felt far too familiar. A coworker warned me that it would be a difficult movie to view and not to watch it. Maybe it wasn't the worst idea to sit down and give it a chance after all because now that I have sat with it, I've grown in appreciation for the performance, score and attention to detail.\"  Frankly this movie stays with you long after you have digested it.

With divorce plaguing 50% of couples, the movie really captured the love, resentment, hardship, and confusion of the situation.   \n\nThe reason I just can't give this movie more stars is because it's insanely depressing.  I don't watch TV or Movies very often, so if I do spend my time watching something, I want it to be worth it.   For me, this movie was not.  The fact that it's relatable is not a compliment unfortunately.   If you wanted to talk someone out of getting married, all you would need to do is show them this movie.   I kept waiting for Charlie and Nicole to get caught in a moment of lust at least once.  I was left dissatisfied by the lack of the intimacy despite the chemistry that was built up between them.   The movie is called \"Marriage Story,\" but it's nothing of the sort.  It starts off with Charlie and Nicole reading over a list of things they love about each other only to find out it was an assignment from their mediator.  This is not a story of Marriage.  It's a story of divorce, heartbreak, and grief.   I don't know about you, but I have enough of that in my life.  Movies are supposed to be an escape from reality, not a reminder.    When Charlie finally gets to read Nicole's list, the emotion is so real and raw, you'd think the ending would have been more satisfying, but nope...

The ending was not only satisfying but rings pretty true to real life when experiencing divorce and co-parenting. (SPOILER: don't read if you haven't seen the movie yet.) But in the end, the courts really do go away and divorced people who no longer love each other really are stuck with each other for life when there are children involved.

The movie also seems to justify divorce in a marriage that has no problems other than personality differences and an affair. To some that may seem like the right decision, but all I saw was a broken family that would never be the same, and a kid who'd have to grow up with parents who were too arrogant to stay married.

            "content": "MARRIAGE STORY by Armen Pandola\n\nNetflix's Marriage Story, written and directed by Noah Baumback (The Meyerowitz Stories) and starring Scarlett Johansson as Nicole and Adam Driver as Charlie, tells the story of the divorce of two young artists at the beginning of their careers. She is a young actress known for a topless scene in her last movie (this is according to the people in this movie) and he is an avant garde theater director and head of his own company in New York City.  When they meet by chance, they fall in love and she moves to NYC where she becomes the 'draw' for his theater company. Eventually, they have a son. At the beginning of the movie, they are getting a divorce after 10 years and are seeing a mediator in the hope of having a  friendly divorce.\n\nIs it a spoiler to tell you that a friendly divorce is rarer than a vegetarian meal at Mar-a-Lago? I knew a couple who mediated their divorce and everything was going well until they got to the jazz album collection (this was back in the day) which they were to split evenly. He objected - she didn't know Dizzy Gillespie from Dizzy Dean when I met her. She countered - yes, he introduced me to jazz but I was the one who actually bought and cared for our collection of over a 1000 albums - if it were up to him, he'd still be using his albums as coasters at the drunken parties he and his friends threw every week. And so much for mediation.\n\nThe upshot of Marriage Story is that good people get divorced and often do terrible things, things they'd never dream of doing except for the divorce. And that's what happens to Nicole and Charlie. The contested divorce legal process is unfair and incredibly expensive. Laura Dern is Nicole's lawyer and she explains to Nicole that she cannot admit to any wrong-doing or even any flaws since our world treats women/wives/mothers so differently than men/husbands/fathers. Women/wives/mothers must be like Mary, mother of Christ and a virgin to boot. Men are like Joseph - who is absent when the going gets tough and isn't even the actual father who is away somewhere doing whatever it is that gods do.\n\nThe other side is represented by Ray Liotta who tells Charlie that he had better get ready to be demonized and pay legal bills and costs that would make a lottery winner cringe. At first, Charlie is represented by a nice lawyer played by Alan Alda who tells him, \"We have to prepare to go to court hoping we don't go to court.\" When Charlie sees that Dern is crushing Alda at a meeting, he switches to Liotta who can talk faster and be meaner than anybody else.\n\nAlong the way, there's a custody dispute. At the very beginning of the divorce, Nicole goes to LA to do a TV pilot (her first acting job outside her husband's company in a decade)  and takes their son with her. The expectation is that she will return to NYC when the pilot is completed but then - she doesn't. Her family is in LA where she grew up and made a career as an actress. The money is exponentially better than doing theatre work. So, Charlie can only see his son by traveling cross country on weekends.  As is usual in divorces where there are children,  the child becomes the center of the divorce with each side claiming that it knows best for the child. Of course, the divorce is devastating to children, but that is a different movie and Baumbach concentrates on the adults.\n\nIt gets complicated quickly. The heart of the story is told in long takes where both Johansson and Driver communicate their rage at what is happening to them and the man/woman they loved. These longs takes show both Johansson and Driver's acting chops - each of them is able to build a scene to the point where real emotions are on display. The hateful argument  they have at the end of the divorce process is contrasted with the tender affection for both their partner's qualities and deficiencies that they talk about at the beginning of the process. In fact, it is probably true to say that if you can find a person who loves not only your wit and charm, but your surliness and bad habits, then you should chase him/her until you catch him/her because that is the person who loves you.\n\nTwo songs from Sondheim's Company are sung - \"You Could Drive a Person Crazy\" by Nicole and her actress mother and actress sister, played beautifully by the under-appreciated Julie Haggerty and Merritt Wever, and \"Being Alive\" from the same musical sung by Driver. Each song speaks to what their characters are feeling about each other. Strangely, in Company, there is even a more appropriate song they could have sung - The Little Things You Do Together:\n\n\nIt's the little things you share together,\nSwear together,\nWear together,\nThat make perfect relationships.\nThe concerts you enjoy together,\nNeighbors you annoy together,\nChildren you destroy together,\nThat keep marriage intact.\n\nIt's not talk of God and the decade ahead that\nAllows you to get through the worst.\nIt's \"I do\" and \"you don't\" and \"nobody said that\"\nAnd \"who brought the subject up first?\"\nIt's the little things,\nThe little things, the little things, the little things.\n\nThere is so much to recommend this movie that I hesitate to mention a few missteps. While money is mentioned, often, it isn't really talked about in substance. The fact is that many people never recover, financially, from a divorce. This is partially solved in the movie by a gift from the gods that drops in their lap during the divorce. A bigger problem is that Baumbach wants it both ways - the great angry scenes where people say things to each other that they don't mean, but once said can never be unsaid, and the happy ending. One of the best angry arguments that Nicole and Charlie have is negated by their embrace at its end. The fact is that arguments drive people further apart and don't end in an embrace but, usually, a slammed door.  There are some maudlin scenes whose purpose is to show that they have moved on with their lives and are doing fine, and still think of each other with love and affection. And a divorce that ends that way is rarer than a 2-for-1 meal at Mar-a-Lago.",

The film is loaded with great supporting cast (Alan Alda, Ray Liotta, Laura Dern are especially memorable) and the march towards the inevitable conclusion feels both agonizing and satisfying altogether. Driver shows depth and dimension as the controlling Charlie and Johansson buble up energy and apathy as the awakened Nicole.  It's interesting to see how 2 actors who in real life portray the divorcing pair - Johansson, a very public figure on marriage #3 and Driver a very private figure still on marriage #1. At times Charlie seems shell shocked by the whole process while Nicole can transition between wresting the couple's child from her husband while at the same time lovingly cutting his hair.

            "content": "Wow. What a great story about relationships and the beginnings and endings of them. Marriage Story is a flawless, heartbreaking story led by two of some of the best performances of the year. Adam Driver is phenomenal. Most people know him from the new Star Wars Trilogy but people should really see some of his other films. He usually does a great job but in this film, he is 100% dedicated to the role. They are certain scenes in the film where it doesn't feel like he is acting. It feels as if he is actually this character and going through all of these troubles. He puts so much emotion into his performance that it is heartbreaking yet mesmerizing. Scarlett Johansson gives yet again another fantastic performance. While her performance isn't as mesmerizing as Driver's performance, it's still perfect. She also conveys a huge amount of emotion with her role but adds a slightly more comedic and relaxed atmosphere to Driver's serious and hardworking atmosphere. Both actors play off each other perfectly, even in scenes where their characters are fighting with each other. Every other performance in the film is pretty great, especially from Laura Dern. The script for Marriage Story is fantastic. It compliments the performances and feels very natural. It knows how much the characters need to say to get a point across or when to restrict them. The music and cinematography are great. The music is done by Randy Newman (Toy Story) and fits the depressing tone the film is going for. The film makes the good choice of not using music during certain dramatic scenes which helps make those scenes more emotional. The cinematography isn't groundbreaking by any means but there are a lot of beautiful shots. Towards the beginning of the movie, there is a 5 minute uncut shot of Scarlett Johansson talking about why she stopped being in love with Adam Driver's character and it's great. There is one sequence in the film that is perfectly shot, acted, and scripted and it's the argument scene. I felt sad and a smidge emotional for the characters throughout the film but this one scene made me feel a whole lot. It's one of the best scenes in cinema this year. Adam Driver and Scarlett Johansson completely disappear in this scene. It doesn't feel like acting. It feels like the filmmakers just filmed real people breaking apart. The emotion displayed in this one scene is off the charts. It cemented for me that Adam Driver is a masterclass actor that people should pay more attention to besides being known as \"the guy from Star Wars\". The rest of the film has its emotional moments but they don't top that scene. The film's plot is pretty straightforward but the way the characters interact makes the film feel unpredictable. Noah Baumbach used his direction to make a straightforward story feel unique. I'm going to start paying more attention to Baumbach from here on out. Overall, Marriage Story is a fantastic film about relationships and divorce with some of the best performances of the year, an outstanding screenplay, unique direction, and some great cinematography and music.",

Scenes shine where actors are given the time and language to build and gather momentum -- Driver and Scarjo; Dern and Liotta. While the middle clunks along with back and forths to and from NY-LA and Driver's incessant search for a lawyer, the authentic performances and attention to detail carry the film. While the writer/director lived his research, the personal doesn't get in the way of cinematic storytelling, instead, fuels it. Much of the magic here comes through nuance -- a juxtaposition of frames, a silent act of generosity, even a look. With dashes of much needed comedy, Marriage Story avoids the trappings of melodrama and sentimentality and is the kind of small intimate story we rarely get these days -- too often passed over by producers and audiences alike. Without a \"happy ending\" or a winning party, much less a clear battle between good and evil, instead, Marriage Story is a cross section of 2 lives, and a worthy contribution to the cinematic relationship canon.",

Attorneys get to bill more at ungodly rates for very basic work, and the parties are rewarded for only thinking of themselves in a zero sum game. Who loses? Well, everyone...but that loss becomes part of the process as well. The mental anguish becomes a sacrifice for the attorney fees/increased time, couples look back with bitterness, and children suffer from the cross fire. \n\nI'm not sure if it was therapeutic to see it's not just me, and to have something I could relate to so deeply...but this should definitely be seen as a very accurate warning sign for couples separating. I suspect that it was exorcism of a few demons for the writer/director as well. \n\nThe acting is uniformly excellent, and it was especially nice seeing Allan Alda as the voice of reason that is completely useless in a process of the damned. \n\nOn the negative side, the film's last half hour dragged, and it could have used heavy editing.

This divorce pushes them to their limits and changes them, but while this is affecting them they're also trying to provide a happy environment for their son.  In about August, this became my most anticipated film of the year.  I just love Scarlett Johansson and Adam Driver proved to be great with his Oscar nomination for BlacKkKlansman.  Also I discovered Noah Baumbach last year with his film While We're Young which I think is very underrated.  He's had a few Oscar nominations and is just a great screenwriter and director.  Before Marriage Story my favorite of his was the slice of life Frances Ha.  This film affected me on so many levels emotionally.  I don't know how one could possibly watch this without shedding at least one tear.  It's so incredibly real and it's just amazing how it all played out.  Scarlett Johansson has her best performance once again.  I feel like every time she's in a film she just gets better and better.

I don't know how one could possibly watch this without shedding at least one tear.  It's so incredibly real and it's just amazing how it all played out.  Scarlett Johansson has her best performance once again.  I feel like every time she's in a film she just gets better and better.  The hardest part about this film is that it shows both sides and you can switch back and forth between who you like more and who you like less.  But also you don't want them to split up.  Noah Baumbach did great with this because it's a frustrating film.  It engages you into the characters and story so much that you start to feel so much anger and frustration and happiness and comedy.  The tone has literally everything and blends it great.  Back to the comedy, this film has some pretty funny moments that helped with the depressing tone.  Marriage Story just made me depressed, especially the very end, and it still lingered after I watched it.  The very end just crushed me but it was also the best scene in the whole film.  Just everything blends so nicely in this.  Randy Newman's score is one of my favorites of the year.  It's so joyful and sad at the same time.  Listening to it before seeing the film I was confused how it would work with the story, because there are times where it sounded just so animated.  It just worked perfectly.  I also liked the aspect ratio choice of 1.66:1 because it felt more like a home movie.  To me 1.33:1 and 1.66:1 work nice for a home movie feel.  Everything was just so realistic in this and I didn't want it to end.  This has become my fourth favorite film of the year so far.  Also it's one of those films where I don't want to rewatch it too much so it surprises me every time with how great it is.  I do that with my favorite films.  Marriage Story is a film that should be recognized as one of the best of the decade.  It demonstrates peak storytelling, superb acting, and shows that Noah Baumbach is one of the best directors out there.  I really think it would be cool if it won best picture, screenplay, and acting.  There are so many words I have for this and I want to talk about it for a while.  I think I'll leave it like this so you can experience it for yourself.  Marriage Story is another perfect movie of the year.\n\nMy Grade: A+",

(3 out of 5 stars for me...if you hate melodrama then avoid at all costs...if you love it this is one of the best to come along in a while (4-5 stars depending on how much you want to hear Kylo Ren sing the work of Sondheim)",

            "content": "Noah Baumbach's indie divorce drama Marriage Story (2019) is a heartfelt retrospective on his failed marriage to Jennifer Jason Leigh. As awful as the divorce proceedings get, Marriage Story succeeds in entertaining and resonating as it's not a vitriolic or hateful movie. Baumbach's writing is reflective and fair to my perspective. He establishes how genuine and loving their relationship started with touching letters of positive aspects, then delves into what made with marriage fizzle out, and finally assigns blame to both parties. Noah Baumbach's Marriage Story is a resounding triumph of goodwill and heartbreak through an empathetic lens. He understands the pain and perspective of each of his leads making for realistic and honest writing. Noah has crafted a fine art film about marriage, divorce, and love in one of 2019's best movies: Marriage Story.\n\nScarlett Johansson is poignant as Nicole Barber, who felt held back and unappreciated in her marriage. Johansson gives her leading lady a striking voice of adoring wife, decent mother, talented actress, fun partner, vindictive divorcee, and resentful spouse. It's a complicated role that ensures you empathize with her disconnected experience and sympathize with her hurt pride and concerned persona. I appreciate her hurt eyes and nuanced faces. She says so much with subtle changes in expression and tearful monologues. She is intimate in this role like I have not seen Scarlett since Sofia Coppola's Lost in Translation. Considering Scarlett's best acting is in Lost in Translation, Her, and now Marriage Story, she should continue to delve into the emotionally devastating world of divorce. At least, I hope Scarlett Johansson acts in more serious dramas like Marriage Story!\n\nAdam Driver delivers a masterful dramatic leading man role in Marriage Story as Charlie Barber. He is fascinating as a doting father, dedicated director, passionate artist, fun guy, and neglectful husband. Driver's finest acting is here in Marriage Story. I loved him in Silence and BlacKKKlansman, but Marriage Story is nuanced like few actors could ever hope to achieve. His shocked expressions are very understated. The way he puts his hand to his mouth to cover up his pain or his sudden outrage at his spouse displeasure is inspired. His quiet depiction of suffering is as riveting as his burst of frustration when he and Scarlett scream at each other in a phenomenally entertaining scene. He sings a sullen song in a depressing scene, but his refined performance equals Scarlett's all encompassing role. Adam Driver is a character actor with range as exemplified in Marriage Story with good humor, kind affection, gentle manner, dejected anguish, indignant disgust, rage filled fury, and defeated nonchalance. He displays Charlie's heart openly for all the world to feel.\n\nI adore Laura Dern's viper divorce lawyer Nora Fanshaw going for everything. Dern demonstrates a phenomenal irreverence for the pain of others as a cold hearted woman beaten down by divorce herself, gunning for every last cent on behalf of her client. Dern is delightful to watch as she destroys a man's life with a determined glee. Her ruthless attitude would work for a mafia boss as well as it does in Marriage Story as an L.A. divorce lawyer.\nLikewise, Ray Liotta brings cunning and sharpness to his brutally honest divorce lawyer Jay Marotta. He is the ideal verbal and legal duellist for Laura Dern. Their courtroom banter is like watching fire spit upon fire in hellish combat. It's one of Marriage Story's best sequences. I love Ray Liotta in Marriage Story as you are on edge in eager anticipation of his next argument.\n\nOn the other hand, Alan Alda gives a funny supporting role as a fatalist divorce lawyer already counting Charlie out named Bert Spitz. His dry wit is amusing, but his hopeless attitude is the saddest aspect to his intriguing character. Wallace Shawn even has a funny cameo in Marriage Story as the inappropriate veteran actor. I liked Azhy Robertson's performance as the young boy Henry Barber, who goes from indecisive to spoiled and back to affectionate all within a single scene. Julie Hagerty is hilarious as Scarlett's valley girl mom Sandra. I dearly enjoyed Merritt Wever's cameo as Scarlett's sister Cassie. Her anxious dread at having to serve Charlie is too relatable and hilarious.\n\nAlongside Baumbach's empathetic lens as writer, his direction for Marriage Story is fantastic. He captivates you by telling each side of the story openly and in intimate spaces. Noah Baumbach's indie direction is simple and sleek so as to allow his cast to perform as if on a stage. His open and free style is earnest with stark images of hatred, loathing, disappointment, shock, betrayal, and affection alike. Noah Baumbach's indie direction feels more like you are watching a documentary of this divorce rather than a film. Marriage Story is akin to awkwardly sitting in a room with divorce proceedings occurring.\n\nJennifer Lame's editing is very pretty and smooth as she seamlessly shifts scenes from Charlie to Nicole with effortless cuts that keep you engaged. Marriage Story is nearly two and a half hours, yet it only feels like one due to Lame's gentle hand.\n\nAll of cinematographer Robbie Ryan's close-up shots of hurt faces and crying eyes made my own eyes cry tears. Marriage Story is deeply affecting and wholly engrossing as you absorb all the adoration and resentment of these characters. Many medium shots reveal all the awkward body language and unspoken feelings in impressively executed long takes. Baumbach and Ryan fasten your focus purely on the emotional distress caused in each scene with unwavering camerawork.\n\nRandy Newman's score is beautiful with soft strings and melancholic classical to underline the sorrowful tone of Marriage Story. His music is nice to hear and never oversteps his boundaries to distract from the story, performances, or direction. Newman composes subtle melodies that chime in only when necessary like a warm blanket appearing when you need it.\n\nFinally, I'm sure Marriage Story will prevail at The Oscars, deservedly so, for its powerful performances, personal writing, and grounded direction. Noah Baumbach opens his heart to ensure that Scarlett Johansson and Adam Driver can depict complex, flawed characters that feel like real people. Marriage Story is sure to become a classic piece of Americana.",

With his latest feature, writer/director Noah Baumbach has crafted a powerful portrait of a couple going through a painstaking divorce. In spite of the serious subject matter, the film is by turns funny and heartbreaking. Baumbach's screenplay is excellent and captures the process of divorce in a piercingly honest and authentic way. Filled with compelling characters, witty dialogue and realistic situations, the script elevates the movie to another level. Aside from excelling behind the camera, Baumbach draws excellent performances from his cast. Adam Driver and Scarlett Johansson are incredible in the lead roles, creating a fractured relationship that is utterly believable. Driver delivers his finest performance to date as Charlie. Intense, charismatic and emotionally resonant, he proves that he is one of the finest actors working today. Johansson, on the other hand, is award-worthy in one of her first dramatic roles. With emotional expressions, she captures the frustrations of a women that is dissatisfied with her relationship. Both actors carry the film firmly on their shoulders. Although \"Marriage Story\" offers heartwarming entertainment, ultimately it is not a film without flaws. If I had a minor issue with the movie, it would be the lengthy running-time. At over two hours, it is slightly long and could have been tighter in length. Nevertheless, fans of dramas will definitely enjoy \"Marriage Story\" and so will anyone that has ever gone through a divorce. It offers a heartfelt portrayal of a divorce that is sure to be remembered come awards season.",

Scar Jo is not her most attractive in this film and looks short and dumpy next to the other tall characters. Her haircut is hideous. True to form, her acting is always great, if you can stand this depressing script. I have no idea why Adam Driver is even an actor, he is not even remotely cute and I can't stand to watch him. His best scene was when he was writhing on the kitchen floor after accidentally stabbing himself with a knife.  Back to British murder mysteries for me! Had to watch two episodes of one after this dragging monotonous people next door hating each other for no reason kind of movie. Outstanding performances from both Laura Dern as the glamorous tough-as-nails LA divorce attorney and Ray Liotta as her arch nemesis. They needed more, as in MUCH MORE screen time. What a disappointment. Especially give that in this world so many people actually have huge problems in their marriage and no choice but to divorce. These people actually had a decent marriage, no abuse, minimal problems, but because of their own peevishness decided to ruin a young boy's childhood. Stupid and no lesson learned. Some people actually divorce due to unsolvable problems of a greater magnitude. This movie is slow, boring and a huge waste of 2 hours of my Friday night. Please get Scar Jo another film role immediately so she can recover from this sad mess.  Adam Driver's \"Let me show you my singing voice because I went to Julliard in real life\" performance was Meh. As in very, very average. WHy was that in there? Just to show the difference between NY theatre people (they get up and sing in restaurants) and film people in LA? They say that in divorce only the lawyers win, and even with the performances in this dull little film, that is accurate. P.S. Rotten Tomatoes just asked HOW I bought my ticket and indicated my review might not be considered real if I didn't BUY a ticket to this movie. NETFLIX!  I watched it on NETFLIX, with my subscription. They need to add that as an option. It was December 13, and I watched it on NETFLIX. Thank you, Rotten Tomatoes! If this review is not published I will contact you personally to complain.

Noah Baumbach's feature is a two-hour long masterclass that dazzles with the performances of Scarlett Johansson and Adam Driver. Both leads excel at their craft no matter if they share the same scenes or if they're isolated from one another; their chemistry could not be better, I think. What really assists in their performances is a well written screenplay (perhaps the best one of 2019). Baumbach's personal touch in the writing is present throughout, and the leads honour it very well. On a slight note, some people expecting a tear jerker may get exactly what they're looking for; others may not. I was personally more moved by the sheer acting and delivery rather than the arcs themselves. With its final scene, MARRIAGE STORY does well in showing that although going through a divorce can be a rather nasty business, people can still put aside the past and learn to live in a bittersweet harmony. See you at the movies.",

I can't lie  - alluding to the show - I watched this for the director and not the cast (although I bet many would for the reverse). The setting right from the get go, leading you to think this was a happy loving beginning is immediately turned on its head, which I am not sure was hinted in the trailers(didn't regret this decision). The cinematography - from the panning scenes to the scene angles (notably at the start and especially conversations) were executed sublimely. And the raw dialogue- that classic Baumbach brilliance, shines through; leaving me in awe of its realism and constant self reminder how every scene was set with an intention/message. \n\nI must give Johannson her due credit- the stunning raw scenes(her therapist session and heavy-handed interactions with Adam) would not have been possible without her superb craft, proving to younger audiences she is much more than just a one dimensional hot black widow. \n\nAdam who stuck with Noah through his best works: Meyerowitz Stories & While We're Young, albeit as supporting casts is finally given a lead role and does not disappoint. His reticence synergises well with his role, creating fair contrast to Johannson's role which lends realism with its semblance to archetypes of modern day relationships.\n\nAs a young evergreen man, the depth of development we follow the 2 characters through their emotional journey sheds much needed perspectives into the faintly covered theme of divorce.",

Both are fraught and frequently on edge, but they both do a lot to convince you that the separating couple once had immense love and respect for one another, especially with the opening sequences which is brought back beautifully towards the end. It tells the story from both sides, and shows just how ugly a divorce can become, especially when a child is caught in the middle and doesn't fully understand what is happening. It also addresses the problems that both men and women, especially the former, face in obtaining custody, and the struggle a parent will go through for that right. Its informed by reality and keenly observes the mundane moments of court battles with wit and humour and the more contentious moments with sympathy and understanding. Noah Baumbach is a forced to be reckoned with in the movie world, with this and The Meyerowitz Stories demonstrating his prowess both behind the camera and the typewriter. Marriage Story shows how a separation can be both devastating and revelatory, how it can tear 2 people apart, but allow you to see things in the other person that you didn't before. It's mostly a showcase for its 2 actors, but everything it brings to the table make it a film worth seeing.",

But, there it was: Best Actor Drama, Best Actress Drama, Best Supporting Actress, Best Drama, Best Screenplay and Best Original Score. Good grief! I haven\u2019t exactly been hiding under a rock when it comes to movies! Fully chagrined I clicked on Netflix and settled in, fully expecting to be overwhelmingly impressed. I wasn\u2019t but that\u2019s not an indictment by any means. The film was really good just not over the top Bravo! The storyline is actually quite common, one many of us have lived: marriage adrift, divorce, child custody, division of property\u2026.\u201clet\u2019s keep this fair and civil, do what\u2019s best for the kids.\u201d If we\u2019re lucky, amicable works. If not, our lives grind to a brutal, angry halt while attorneys screw everything up and money rolls downhill so their kids can relax about college tuition while our kids start applying for financial aid. Watching Marriage Story is like sitting through 136 minutes of bad lawyer jokes springing to life. The horror. Charlie (Adam Driver), a director of cutting-edge, avant-garde theater, positioned to take his latest work to Broadway, is married to Nicole (Scarlett Johansson), an actress fading from NYC stage renown but still popular in Hollywood. The couple have grown apart, recognizing, despite deeply caring for each other, the point of departure has arrived. Divorce is discussed. Their young son Henry (Azhy Robertson) is the beloved prize and both parents start out determined his interests be top priority. Then a wrinkle emerges. Nicole accepts a career revival offer to film a pilot in Los Angeles. She takes Henry with her to California, moving in with her Charlie-adoring mom (Julie Hagerty). On one of Charlie\u2019s frequent coast-to-coast trips to spend time with his family, Nicole bullies her reluctant Charlie-adoring sister Cassie (Merritt Wever) to serve him with divorce papers, smuggled under a pecan pie, then hires Nora Fanshaw (Larua Dern) as her attorney, a bulldog lawyer who approaches divorce in a \u201cthere will be blood\u201d crusade. Nora relishes in threatening Charlie with loss of all earthly possessions and any hint of custody. Charlie is forced to retaliate. Enter divorce Death Star Jay Marotta (Ray Liotta). At this point we strap in for a gut-wrenching saga of two legal vipers squaring off to pound the other side to pulp, not caring a whit that \u201csides\u201d are flesh and blood people, parents at a starting line of good intentions. Charlie and Nicole recoil, shatterIng under scathing legal posturing and purposeful courtroom annihilation. Even Henry is a won/lost tally at times, the wretched center flag of a parental tug-of-war, Charlie pulling one arm, Nicole the other. Everyone is expendable as collateral damage, Charlie literally bleeding out on his rented California apartment floor in one grueling black humor kitchen scene. Lord, have mercy. What materializes below the waves of the legal hurricane are two decent people, Charlie and Nicole, trying\u2014mostly futilely\u2014but trying nevertheless to resist succumbing to emotional cruelty. Predictably, tirades of fury and fear simmer, seethe and eventually explode. Human combustion. As the vitriol flies, you regret on their behalf what they\u2019re unleashing\u2014 hateful, damning words that can never be taken back, that will echo forever no matter how hard they may wish differently. We\u2019ve all been there. The film taps our jagged relational regrets, remorse and repentance, making \u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d a communal mantra of misery. You want to jump up and shout at the screen, \u201cStop! Don\u2019t say it! Just stop, please.\u201d Adam Driver is not a favorite of mine, he\u2019s so Keanu Reeves with a distinctive monotone delivery, but he did stretch his dramatic persona for this role, perhaps his best performance to date. Petty question #1: how did 6\u20192\u201d Driver gets cast with 5\u20193\u201d Scarlett Johansson? He towered over her. Maybe it was to serve as a visual metaphor for their professional director/actress relationship. Truthfully, Johansson failed to win me over, I never warmed up to Nicole. I was rooting for Charlie, put off by Nicole and annoyed by Henry. Petty question #2: isn\u2019t Henry way too big for a car seat? Cassie, Nicole\u2019s witty sister, was my favorite of all the characters. For the record I am a total Merritt Wever groupie, my enthusiasm for her in Nurse Jackie morphed to sheer hero worship in Netflix\u2019s Godless, the last scene I can watch over and over and over until I\u2019m the last person awake in the household. There were enough funny exchanges in this film, comedy infusion, that thankfully lightened the heavy laden angst. While the attorneys square off, family members rise and fall in their humanness. It\u2019s like taking a selfie of our worst selves against a background of laughter, kindness, and thoughtfulness. If the goal is to showcase the competing dualism of the human spirit then Marriage Story charges ahead of the 2019 drama pack. It didn\u2019t win my vote but maybe because it hit too close to home, taking me on a walk down memory lane of my own awful, demolition derby divorce, fomented by two condescending attorneys who pitted us against each other in a hostile custody battle over our two young sons. 35 years later I still hate the shameful things I said or did. Marriage Story\u2019s \u201cJoin the crowd\u201d is small comfort. I\u2019ll leave it at that. The 77th Golden Globe Awards will be held aired live January 5, 2020 by NBC, 8 EST/5 PST.",

This is so true of real life divorce. No one really wins. Life goes on. Things change. It's heartbreaking to see any child go through this, but it happens every day in a country full of lawyers that will be as ruthless as possible to get what their client \"wants\". A courtroom battle of lawyers talking for their clients, instead of the clients talking to each other. It shows that communication- real, honest communication is the key to any relationship succeeding. The actors were all top notch, most notably Driver, who gives the performance of the year, and maybe this decade. The emotions so raw and real, that you can see the love and hate the estranged coupled have for each other.

            "content": "MARRIAGE STORY-2019(R)-Nov. 29. By:Clem The Movie Guy. Thanksgiving weekend, I got a chance to see an exclusive screening of Marriage Story, the new film from acclaimed writer & director Noah Baumbach. Loosely inspired by Baumbach\u2019s own personal experience & further informed by conversations with friends & lawyers, Marriage Story is an intensely compelling & a realistic look at a married couple going through the turmoil of divorce. Once madly in love with each other, Charlie (Adam Driver), a gifted New York theatre director & Nicole (Scarlett Johansson), a former teen Hollywood film actress who now only performs in his off-Broadway plays, are having trouble with their marriage. Charlie is intensely & somewhat selfishly focused on his work. Nicole has grown tired of living in the shadow of Charlie\u2019s aspirations as Charlie grows increasingly obvious to Nicole\u2019s hopes & dreams. After receiving the offer of a starring role in a television pilot & with the divorce in early stages, Nicole leaves the theatre company & moves to Los Angeles with their young son, Henry (Azhy Robertson) while Charlie remains in New York to see to the process of his play going to Broadway. Later, arriving for a visit in Los Angeles to see Nicole & Henry, Charlie is stunned when he is served with divorce papers, believing that he & Nicole had agreed on an amicably split & to forego using lawyers. Nicole has been persuaded to hire a powerful attorney, Nora Fanshaw (Laura Dern), which inevitably forces Charlie to follow suit. Initially he hires Bert Spitz (Alan Alda), a retired family lawyer who favors a more civil & conciliatory approach but as the contention grows, Charlie must resort to a more aggressive lawyer, Jay Marotta (Ray Liotta). Marriage Story shows not only the difficulties of compromise & self-sacrifice in marriage, further complicated by trying to protect any children involved, but the legal system at its worst with ruthless lawyers manipulating their vulnerable clients. The performances from Adam Driver & Scarlett Johansson were raw & captivating. I believe that Adam Driver gives one of the best performances of his career. I won\u2019t be surprised to see Marriage Story receiving major award consideration for Best Picture, Noah Baumbach for Best Director & Best Screenplay, Adam Driver for Best Actor, & Scarlett Johansson for Best Actress. Marriage Story is a MUST-SEE FILM that is now streaming on Netflix. It will be high on my list of Best Films of 2019.",

I love Joaquin Phoenix's performance in 'Joker' but Adam Driver has now dethroned him. The emotional range he has is incredible. Scarlett Johansson gives her all. She sells the pain and suffering she is going through.\nThe argument scene is jaw-dropping fantastic. The two viciously fighting with their words made me freeze in my chair out of terror and awe. If the two either don't get an Oscar nod or win in their respective categories, I'm gonna riot. The supporting cast is also great. Laura Dern, Alan Alda and Ray Liotta deliever excellent performances as the Barber's lawyers. Azhy Robertson as Charlie and Nicole's son Henry is tremendous.\n\nThe writing is amazing. Feeling realistic and grounded, it's undramatic approach to the subject matter of divorce felt refreshing. The dialogue spoken between characters was at times wickedly funny and other times devastating. \nThe movie also never took sides. It was never biased or one-sided. Both Charlie and Nicole had pros and cons that counteracted each other, leading to a nice, neutral middle ground.\n\nThe cinematography made the movie feel alive. It brought you into this world, and besides the writing and acting, kept you engaged. There wasn't a single frame where I looked away.\n\nEmotional and raw, 'Marriage Story' is a masterpiece in every sense of the word as well as the best film of 2019.",

Wallace Shaw isn't in the film that much, but he contrasts very nicely with Adam Driver's strict sense of direction and purpose, he's just a care-free old man. Julie Haggetry plays the sweet ignorant mother very well, her daughter's marriage is basically over, but she still clings onto this hope that they'll get back together.\n\nOverall as I've already said, one of the best movies of the year watch it asap, it isn't exactly hard to find seeing as how it is on Netflix, but if you can see it in theaters I'd recommend that, a lot of people have said that it's a great way to experience the film.",

It also digs into its messiness and how all of the things that didn't work in the marriage come to the surface in unexpected ways. The screenplay is amazing. Adam Driver (Charlie) and Scarlett Johansson (Nicole) give the very best performances of their careers and probably the best portrayals ever of divorce. Every scene they are in is powerful. There is one scene during which the two of them get into an argument that is of such intense emotional power that one wonders from where they channel that kind of energy and rage. Laura Dern is exceptional as Nicole's compassionate yet self-interested lawyer; my prediction is that she will walk away with the Best Actress Awards for this performance. Driver and Johansson deserve all of the acclaim they are getting for the film. The film gets a huge thumbs up from me and is among my favorites of the year.

With the best screenplay of 2019, as well as one the best directions, this is the closest the world is ever going to get to a realistic depiction of a divorce. Scarlett Johansson and Adam Driver also give the best performances of their lives, elevating every single scene, dialogue, argument, or joke. The long takes allow them to shine and actually work as actors, moving around the set and doing domestic/job tasks, while delivering their lines. Technically, both Baumbach and the entire cast are absolutely perfect. It's an extremely emotional narrative, very depressing, sad, and even uncomfortable at times, which might scare some people off, especially if they've been through this. Despite its replay value being affected (a rewatch is very unlikely), it's a phenomenal lesson in storytelling that stays with us long after it's finished. Easily, one of the best movies of 2019. Don't miss it, and try not to cry.\"",

If you grade films on their writing and acting and directing alone then this film succeeds in all of those areas without any doubt.

And thankfully he employs incredibly talented actors to deliver his words. This film is probably his most serious and heavy to date. There are moments of light humour but this a piece of passion that wears its heart on its sleeve. It's the story of Charlie and Nicole and their son Henry. They work successfully in the New York theatre scene and seemingly have a happy marriage. But the marriage is at breaking point after years of quite disintegration and disinterest. When Nicole flies back home to Los Angeles and files for divorce the film sets in motion the protracted dissolve of their love. We see the minutiae of divorce proceedings in excruciating detail. Adam Driver and Scarlet Johansson have never been better with Driver in particular staking a claim for the finest actor of his generation. Driver is incredidbly adept at delivering emotions on a grandiose scale. The supporting cast is outstanding as well, especially Alan Alda who brings a warm humanity to the film. The writing feels so natural through out. Scenes flow, its editing is perfect, with ease and honesty. There are scenes that are heart breaking to watch, but it's all totally worth it for the emotional pay off. Aided by a subtle score by the great Randy Newman, this film rocked me hard.",

            "content": "I've been trying to come up with a way of reviewing this film in a way that doesn't seem like I personally directed it or something, because movies like Marriage Story don't come along very often and I just feel like gushing about how incredible is. Netflix has been releasing tons of quality content this year and this may very well be the best of their entire catalogue of feature films. Alone with Roma and their recent release of The Irishman, I believe you'll be seeing Marriage Story in contention for many, many awards in the coming months. Here's why I believe Marriage Story is a must-watch.\u00a0\n\nNot all relationships work out and if every single Romance film ever made had a happy ending, then that would just be a lie. It's nice to see a movie tackle this subject matter and stick with it from start to finish. Marriage Story is a look into the lives of Charlie (Adam Driver) and Nicole (Scarlett Johansson) as they are clearly not able to keep a working marriage, but also don't want to ruin the family they have made. From gut-wrenching scenes of excessively honest dialogue and a conclusion that feels raw and true, this movie is one of the best dramas I've seen in years.\u00a0\n\nTake your pick at who outshines who here, because it really is a toss-up as to who is more incredible between Driver and Johansson. It does help that writer/director Noah Baumbach gave them outstandingly good dialogue to work with, but the way these two play off each other is as if they were given a year to prepare for these roles and get to know each other. Everything about this film felt authentic, which made the overall impact so powerful. It's not easy to watch a movie about a love story that's about how marriage sometimes doesn't work out, but this movie does it in such a way that it doesn't feel depressing throughout the majority of the duration. This is all thanks to Noah Baumbach though.\u00a0\n\nFrom Greenberg to While We're Young, Baumbach has been a director I've been keeping my eyes on, as I believe he has gotten better with each of his films, for the most part. It wasn't until The Meyerowitz Stories (New and Selected) that I really started to anticipate his next movie, but now I'll be desperately awaiting to get another story from him. His talent as a director, especially on Marriage Story, is truly something else. He is best suited for movies like Marriage Story or While We're Young, where it's all about the characters because he very clearly has a knack at getting the best possible performances out of his cast.\u00a0\n\nMarriage Story begins strong, easing you into what will be a very emotional film and concludes in a way that feels natural. Overall, from these award-worthy performances, superb writing and directing, a very minimal score, which lets you sit with these characters for extended periods of time, it's very hard to nitpick this movie. There is one scene that made me chuckle, purely because I felt uncomfortable, but this movie is otherwise perfectly done. By the time 2019 ends, I feel that I may have to say this is the best movie of the year. I absolutely loved every minute of this movie. I can't recommend it enough.",

This movie is so realistic and compelling that I would dare say it's the best Johansson has ever been in a movie in the last ten years.",

Over a timespan inferred as a couple of years Marriage Story plots the emotional strain of a breakup. It depicts the couple's efforts to part amicably while living at opposite ends of the USA. Nicole attempts to reignite her L.A screen career while Charlie's successful stage play moves to Broadway. Both are seemingly geographically set in their ways and by extension their personal sense of who they are as people and as \u2018artists'. Circumstances accelerate to the point where involving lawyers seems like the obvious escalation. As thin tolerances give way and frays taking its toll on both parties; unassuming interactions are amplified and held to scrutiny under the microscope of divorce law \u2013 and emotions boil over. Caught in the middle of there is their child, Henry.\n\n\n\nReview and Analysis: At first glance this is not a film that would typically draw you in, its subject matter of middle class failed love. It is not a rom-com but there is comedy. There is drama but not forced. \n\nThe film employs a tenacious set-up and false start that immediately asserts these two characters' story into your viewing curiosity. The film's narrative in this respect is very shrewd in its portrait of a once in love couple. It does this through the motivations and self-interests of the central characters. Both Nicole and Charlie's stories are told with a considerable amount of heart, you warm to both of them. You empathise with them and you may recognise a trait in their current emotional entanglement- the complexities of a simple discourse.  They are friends with separate desires and ambitions.  Quirks and idiocentricties, often admirable in redeeming qualities and overtly flawed in their application. They're people, possibly like you. \n\nCaptured within Marriage Story's script, the film allows for breathing space as characters development within the central conflict. They are not forced onto you either in any sanctimonious manner. Quite the opposite. Tightly detailed in structure it never feels constricting for performance. This is further reinforced in the naturalistic settings; opting for a bold realism in the drama \u2013 it is strangely high-key lit film for the most part. It feels modern, in keeping with a certain social morality and expected forms of adult behaviour.  Instead of reclining on tropes which often a film of this nature might fall back on.  But instead honest and smart. There is sense of dry wit that underpins, sometimes out of awkward circumstances (Halloween pumpkins) but also provides subtle set-up for much darker punchlines. Sometimes played out in the direction of external relations of the characters, notable in the pragmatic conceit of divorce law when juxtaposed with the couples' wounds. \n\nThis interplay of the characters predicament is surmised in the line of dialogue that divorce law is about showing \u2018good people at their worst'. This is one of the film's main inquires, giving the film its depth. It is not necessarily about relationships per say, you never suspect that the characters never stopped loving each other, but rather it casts assertions on the legal practice of divorce proceeding. Divorce is messy despite initial good intentions; conducted with a level of callous manipulation through a veil of identification (hugs). At its best divorce is a selfish preservation of the self: whatever that was or might be, or wants to be. At its worst institutionally exploitative.  All the while, ironically, divorce is what is best for the child, (Henry). Custody, ultimately, is shown to be another weapon in the divorce arsenal\u2013 despite good intentions of preservation. \n\nThe audience witness both Charlie's and Nicole's emotional personalities, as people, as well as their legal identities \u2013 what they become in the eyes of the court; morphing them into gross caricature that they themselves don't recognize. In this respect the directions aims to walk a line of objectivity between Charlie and Nicole. Marriage Story attempts to provide a neutral stance and in part succeeds, never really wanting to take sides. The films narration will often switch attention between the two asking the audience to witness both sides of the story while inferring what the other may or may not have done. We are told that a child is never a reliable mediator. Though at times Nicole's screen time maybe limited in the second act of the film, she still has a presence on the story. You never sense a protagonist antagonist in the their relationship, the film reminds balanced in its character study.\n\nJohansson and Driver are allowed to act and get to grips with their character, and both supply some stand out moments of range that gives us a certain intimacy, allowing the audiences to get to know these characters' vulnerabilities, but still retaining an objective distance in choice of shot design and blocking. For example: early in the narrative, Nicole meets her lawyer for the first time, Johansson really excels within the observing frame.\n\nMarriage Story rarely cuts as the camera works to record rather than a forced construction of the film's own preconceived notions of who these people are, it is secondary to the performances. The camera is kept at a distance often opting for wides and medium long shots allowing performance within a locked-off camera. For example a characters may walk out of the shot into another room, they may hold in a long or walk into a close up. At choice moments the edit selects signals the cut as means of separation. When the camera provokes meaning it is done for duality and emotional similarities they share. This is also reflected in the tempo of the edit. The eventual court case the camera mirrors both pairs, Nicole with her lawyer and likewise Charlie with his within their respected two shots, the lead characters are still keep at distance through the cut. And we may infer meaning when the camera cuts away to profile head shots. What is particularly clever about this moment is the direction of Laura Dern and Ray Liotta, their lawyers. Throughout the film lawyers are viewed as an extension of the lead characters, an avatar for the central motivations. They can easily embrace their clients with empathy, turn on the bluster when it matters but just as easily turn it off to ask for their sandwich orders. They know the tricks and how to manipulate the perceptions when \u2018in the courts'. When the edit eventually does cut to a different angle away from the back and forth mirroring it is to show us the judge who has been insofar absent, he is at the back of the room in a big wide. Thus, he has not been significant in the action nor the bigger picture of the film's inquiry. In the respect Marriage Story successfully provides an absurdist comment of the legal identities that contrast with a very real human persona. A well applied narrative contradiction throughout the storytelling. As such we are being asked to judge the etiquette of divorce rather than infer a verdict of the central characters. Who, for all intended purposes, set out to split amicably? Furthermore, since we have been given an objective portrait in prior narrative events it is somewhat difficult to pass a judgement \u2013 the judge himself cannot \u2013should you? It is in this sequence that film also shows a level of self-awareness and what the film will be heavily criticized for. The judge concludes for the sake of the \u2018people who don't have the resources your clients have'. It is in this keen self-awareness of the practices divorce the attempts to probe. Both Charlie and Nicole's world's, other than their divorce, is reasonable stable. Both are successful. Both have a support network. Both have a sense of their creative identity. They world is comfortable. The audiences who see themselves, perhaps those 30 somethings who found a level of success, who grew up and found themselves in a new phase of their life will prise Marriage Story because of a recognizable ego. For this reason Marriage Story is of the now, modern, with modern sensibilities. And for the same reason the film will be criticized: why should we care about this white middle class couples, what is their real struggle? Both camps missing the subtext that the film is subtlety satirising the very people who purport the mean spirted trivialities of divorce and divorce law. This is not to say it is honest. It is. This is not to say the film is mean spirited. It isn't- but rather walks a fine line of tragedy and comedy allowing for a textual inquiry. Indeed, Marriage Story cares a great deal about its character, but rather the pain of what they represent. This can be best observed in the finals stages of act 3. Charlie and Nicole argue, it is emotion full of passion. Driver and Johansson work off of each with flowing intense nuance within intelligent blocking. What really helps to signify their emotional state is the Mise en Scene, it a bare L.A apartment. They are at their emotional peak, annulled. Empty.\n\nFinally Marriage Story makes comments on gender representation drawing a comparison between a toxic masculine identity of the past, which Laura Dern's character alludes to, and the characterization of Charlie. There is an obvious contrast. But still there is a level of expectation of gender roles when seeking custody, which divorce can capitalise on. The expectation of which gender is supposedly best for custody has changed though the perceptions of court ideals has only shifted the goal posts and stereotype still prevails. Perhaps again showing a level of self \u2013 awareness knowing a likely comparison to that of Kramer vs Kramer (1979). A film which very much trends the same beats but without the modernity. The drama of Marriage Story simmers, you may expect it to turn to the hatred and abuse of Revolutionary Road (2008)with its take on gender. However, Charlie and Nicole's relationship is balanced and the film often treats them with warmth. Nor does it draw attention to itself in form in the same manner as Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind (2004). It is modest and unassuming\n\nMarriage Story is executed with powerful performances that provide well-developed characters. The film is very smart with a considerable amount of maturity and thought in narrative cinema engaging you in its story and ideas.  Though the film is bitter sweet in its final treatment of these ideas. On the surface it confirms to hegemonic norms, returning to the simplicity of the amicable rather than giving solutions to the systems it attempts to examine.  And though the time-span may have been taxing for the Charlie and Nicole they will move on; nonetheless, Marriage Story provides an endearing bookend to their love. Though a question reminds \u2013 what struggles were truly endured when \u2018people who don't have the resources' may not have such a positive outcome. And for this reason, given the need for representation rightly so, how Marriage Story will be revived during awards season reminds to seen \u2013 the demise of a white somewhat wealthy couple doesn't seem enough to give pause, despite Driver and Johansson at their very best. Shame.\n\nNonetheless a must see for the power of good modern drama\n\nLife will go on. Change will happen. \n\n4 failed marriages out 5",

They do have a son (Azhy Robertson), which can only add further complications.  Now because this has been getting such high acclaim, I made it a priority to watch it day one when it became available on streaming.  I frankly have never been a fan of what I have seen from director Noah Baumbach, so I will be honest and say that I didn't have all that high of expectations of this.  All that aside, I will be damned if he didn't put together one of my very favorite moves of the year.  Now, where I usually run into problems with Baumbach is that his movies typically feature highly unlikable characters, like with Greenberg or Frances Ha.  For me, it makes it so the narrative becomes utterly inaccessible, and you could make that argument here as well, but there is one thing that I feel is this movie's saving grace: the opening 8 minutes.  It grabs you and doesn't let you go, and you fall in love with this family.  You see how good it can be, and it made me put my full investment in this story.  Everything about this rings true and authentic, and much like an actual divorce, things can get ugly as tensions mount.  Even though my stomach was in knots for almost the entire movie, there is a fortuitous strength this movie features prominently: you understand both sides.  I honestly kept going back and forth on whose corner I was in, which speaks volumes to how rounded and fully realized these characters are.  Something clearly broke in their relationship, and you are rooting for them to be able to recover, but understand if that isn't something that is in the cards.  Every single conversation in this feels genuine to the point that it makes you wonder how detailed the script is; this just feels like two people having real-life conversations, which only sucks you deeper into the film.  This is a raw and emotionally charged film, and I don't know if everybody out there is going to be able to handle it.  For me, I fell in love with it, and I didn't even feel like I was watching a movie for most of this, I got that lost in this story.  I can see this getting three acting nominations easy; Johansson and Driver are expectedly great, but I also really loved Laura Dern as Johansson's lawyer, and it wouldn't surprise me in the slightest to see her getting a supporting nod.  I watched this by myself, and I feel like if you watch this with your significant other, this will be a big-time conversation starter.  You're not going to need to start filing divorce papers, mind you, but you will want to do better in understanding the other's point of view, which is never a bad thing.",

When she gets an offer to work in LA, it makes their impending separation much more stressful. There's more focus on the husband, perhaps because his situation is more disruptive or because writer/director Noah Baumbach based this on his own experience. As a result, Driver is given the bulk of the heavy lifting and his character's dilemma (and his performance) is absolutely heart breaking. Johansson also does a fine job, along with a wonderful supporting cast, esp. Laura Dern and Alan Alda. It's good that they both play their attorneys, because the legal angles tend to drag down the emotional development. As their young son, Azhy Robertson is exceptionally natural.

            "content": "Essentially a remake of a superior film made 40 years earlier, Kramer vs. Kramer (1979), this movie is a decent enough exploration of a divorce and it's impact on a family in a contemporary setting. The performances are very good but the screenplay has the feel of a play and that leaves you with many monologues that feel overwritten and unrealistic when they should seem honest and authentic. For me there was just something missing as while I love Noah Baumbach as a director and I have found his previous work to be fantastic this was a disappointment as it was simply acceptable when it could have been a masterpiece.\n\nActress Nicole, Scarlett Johansson, is disgruntled with her husband Charlie Barber, Adam Driver, due to his affair with Mary Ann, Brooke Bloom, and his devotion to his own career as a theatre director. She feels that she has been forced to discard her own ambitions as an actress to support him while he lives in New York City despite her wanting to move to Los Angeles where she had grown up. The couple go through counseling but this is unsuccessful and they will be separated as she has accepted a role in a television pilot and he intends to continue directing the play that she had starred in with a new actress. She serves him with divorce papers shortly after he arrives in Los Angeles to visit her and their son Henry, Azhy Robertson. They each take on aggressive lawyers in the form of Nora Fanshaw, Laura Dern, for Nicole and Jay Marotta, Ray Liotta, for Barber after the more gentle Bert Spitz, Alan Alda, fails to negotiate successfully. Both become depressed as they are lonely without their partners and struggle to understand how they could have once loved each other.\n\nInitially I was pleasantly surprised at the fact that we were seeing the separation from Nicole's perspective as I had assumed that with Baumbach being male he would value Barber over his wife. This later proved to be true as the last three quarters of the film are largely devoted to seeing the effect that Barber not being around his son has on him while his shortcomings such as him having had an affair are brushed under the rug. One of the things that made Kramer vs. Kramer so great is that while Joanna abandons her child and son we understand that she is doing this so that her son does not have to be around her when she is going through a mental breakdown and wants to be a better mother by first fulfilling herself. Many of Nicole's concerns are articulated here but there is the feeling that she is being selfish by wanting to be in Los Angeles and the finality of their lopsided custody agreement do ask the audience to see her as the unreasonable one.\n\nThe aforementioned monologues also frustrated me as while I could appreciate the fact that people often pour out their emotions and simply can't stop speaking I was always very aware that I was watching people deliver something that had been written. In particular a discussion that Nicole has with lawyer Fanshaw in which she explains the issues in her relationship with her husband was hard for me to digest as an honest articulation of her pain as there was an artificiality to the writing and to Johansson's performance in this scene that took me out of it. Baumbach also doesn't provide supporting characters as strong as those in other divorce based films as Nicole's 64 year old actress mother Sandra, Julie Hagerty, felt like a caricature. In comparison Margaret Phelps, Jane Alexander, served as a legitimate foil to Ted in Kramer vs. Kramer and displayed his development into a mature, loving father.\n\nAt the end of the day the performances are of a high quality as Johansson is provided with her best role since Lost in Translation (2003) and is convincing as a frustrated woman. She is particularly effective in scenes when she silently displays her discomfort with the conduct of her lawyer or the inadvertently hurtful comments made by her husband. Driver gets a lot more to do and is expectedly very good as a man hit with accusations that he had no knowledge of and is very convincing as a man whose anger slowly builds up as time passes and nothing changes for him. The scene in which he final breaks down and tells Johansson that he hopes she dies was a little too much for me but I can see why it needed to be in the film. Other touches added to the film such as Driver's big musical performance simply made me cringe but both get moments to shine and will most likely receive awards recognition.",

            "content": "This is one of the most emotionally beautiful films I have ever seen. It's like if peeling an onion caused you to laugh instead of cry, but still activated your tear ducts.\n\nHoly frickin' lovely. \n\nThis film is a love story about divorce. Charlie (Adam Driver), who is a well-known theatre Director about to take his play to Broadway, and Nicole, (Scarlett Johansson) who has become a well-known actress due to starring in Charlie's plays, meet in this industry and marry living a life together with their son Henry. Ten years into their marriage, Charlie and Nicole decide to divorce amicably without lawyers until Nicole hires a lawyer  unannounced and things start to become worse than initially intended.\n\nDIRECTION:\nNoah Baumbach (not to be confused with Johan Sebastian Bach) did a spectacular job taking a sad subject and showing such purity and grace. The movie is so grounded causing it to feel like two real people who truly love each other going through this tough time. Baumbach also creates a theatrical feel to the film. He does this by having long drawn-out scenes coupled with beautiful dialogue usually only between only 2-3 characters at once.\n\nWRITING:\nI have to double down with what I said under \"DIRECTION.\" The writing is so pure and real, that it feels like you are truly watching the emotional nature of divorce. You truly feel like you're watching a documentary on two people struggling to balance their secretive resentment and love for each other. I always say that my favorite films are those that can keep me engaged strictly through dialogue and this is a perfect example. \n\nACTING:\nAdam Driver me to the Oscars to watch you receive this reward. Oh my goodness and gracious. There's a specific performance in a scene between Mr. Driver and Ms. Johansson that I think could easily by itself deliver an Oscar for both of them. This is also coming off a great performance in \"The Report\" (Adam Driver) and an amazing supporting role in Jojo Rabbit (Scarlett Johansson). Not to mention the superb supporting cast with the likes of Laura Dern, Ray Liotta and Alan Alda. This incredible ensemble really takes the film to another realm of realism and beauty.\n\nCONCLUSION:\nMarriage Story does what it is set out to do and that is make you feel. Through the Direction, Writing and Acting, this film doesn't make you pick sides or dread so much the process of what can be a very dreadful process. Although the story at it's core is sad, this is also one of the funniest movies of the year and it makes me feel like I'm going through a painful divorce with the same feelings that both Charlie and Nicole feel. I still need to see Uncut Gems, Richard Jewell, Little Women, etc., but as of right now this takes the #1 spot in my top 10 in 2019.",

In Marriage Story.\n\nMarriage Story\n\nThe writer and director, Noah Baumbach is spewing love. Not the usual way of expressing. But then, miscommunication is a major factor in this film. He is sugar-coating or bitter-coating a love story, by deconstructing, reverse-engineering a love story. Although that is what it seems at first. The film, above all, wonder me the most, is when it balances both sides of the coin. Every now and then, I think about what happened, why we are here, just as those characters do. It all makes sense and nothing fits despite the description, the definition. And still you don't feel cheated. And Noah dodged that bullet so effortlessly that you- at certain points in the film, even when there is no particularly emotional hurdle to cross- melt with a cathartic smile and tears, in its simple wittiness. The film deliberately follows Adam Driver's perspective. Now, that is a perfect choice, considering he \"is walking on\" something that he doesn't fully understand, just like us, the audience. Hence, he comes off warm and even pitiful at times, more than he actually might be or should. For following Scarlett Johanson would have come off calculative rather than spontaneous. Not something that the film wants to put out. It is vulnerable phenomena to be in. And to experience it, you should be out of control. Desperation is what drives the greed. And greed, something you keep it off the table from Day 1, is what it will come to. Not materialistic but philosophical. You'd want to be how you think of yourself to be. And in these scenarios where you are highly conscious of your decisions and acts. Legacy (Henry, in their case) is what you hold on to or at least fight for, now that you are sober.",

He seems at his best when his work is personal, like 2005's The Squid & the Whale, when he was inspired by his own experience as a child of a divorcing couple. And now, having endured a divorce of his own as an adult, he has made another emotionally charged film that charts the breakdown of a marriage between Adam Driver's Charlie, a NY stage director and Scarlett Johansson's Nicole, an actress who has roots back in LA. Between career choices and their primary concern for their young son, the film explores the difficulties, nuances and facets of a relationship via its dissolution. Despite the title, it's actually an incisive and sobering look at their divorce and when lawyers start meddling, it further acts as an indictment against the flaws and failings of a system that only makes matters worse and far from harmonious. There's much inspired brilliance in Baumbach's handling of the material and in his presentation of snapshot moments during the months, if not years, before they finally make peace with it all. Scenes from a Divorce, if you like; and Baumbach invokes directors such as Allen, Bergman and Pollack, to great effect. Furthermore, Driver and Johansson's mesmerizing performances, especially when they are playing against each other, are infused with intimacies and conflicting emotions. If not for the Netflix stigma, their Oscar nominations are practically guaranteed after that fight scene at Charlie's house. At 136mins, the sometimes meandering duration can feel like cramming a 3-parter into one film, but it's justified as scenes are allowed to breathe and actors have time to flesh out their characters, resulting in something that's grounded yet poetic, hopelessly romantic but also hopefully optimistic.",

            "content": "Noah Baumbach is a writer and director most known for acerbic dramas with a very dark, pessimistic viewpoint. That changed somewhat once he began a filmmaking partnership with actress Greta Gerwig that began with 2013's Frances Ha. Gerwig has since gone on to become an accomplished filmmaker in her own right with 2017's Lady Bird, which earned her Oscar nominations for writing and directing. The partnership seemed to bring out a softer side for Baumbach and they became a romantic couple who had a child earlier in 2019. Hell, Gerwig and Baumbach are even circling writing a Barbie movie together. This is a changed filmmaker and he brings that changed perspective to Marriage Story. It's very different from Baumbach's other movie about divorce, 2005's The Squid and the Whale. I found that movie difficult, detached, and hard to emotionally engage with. Marriage Story, on the other hand, is a deeply felt, deeply observed, and deeply moving film experience that counts as one of the finest films of 2019.\n\nCharlie (Adam Driver) and Nicole (Scarlett Johansson) are heading for divorce. He's a successful theater director. She was a successful movie actress who relocated to New York City and has gotten an offer to shoot a pilot in L.A. Both say they want what's best for their young son Henry (Azhy Robertson) but this will be tested as Charlie and Nicole push one another for what they feel is their best version of their family.\n\nThe observational detail in Marriage Story is awe inspiring. I was floored by how involved I got and how quickly, and that's because Baumbach has achieved what few filmmakers are able to, namely present a world of startling authenticity. There is a richness in the details, small and large, that makes the entire story feel like you've captured real life and thrown it onscreen. I wouldn't pry but Baumbach himself went through divorce around the time he was writing this, and I have to think some of those feelings and details seeped into this screenplay. Baumbach's direction favors clarity and giving his actors wide berths to unleash meaty monologues or dynamic dialogue exchanges. The writing is sensational and every character is given a point of view that feels well realized. Even the combative lawyers (Laura Dern, Ray Liotta) have perspectives you can see why they're fighting for what they believe is right. But it's watching Charlie and Nicole together that brings the most excitement. Watching the both of them onscreen allows for so much study the little histories behind their words, their gestures, their impulses, and they feel like a great mystery to unpack. It feels like a real relationship you've been dropped into and left to pick up the histories and contradictions and all the rest that make people who they are.\n\nIt's very easy and understandable for divorce dramas to essentially pick sides, to present a clearly defined protagonist and antagonist, like 1979's Kramer vs. Kramer. It's easier for an audience to have a clear side to root for and a clear villain to root against, someone who they can see is more responsible for this breakdown of the family unit or for the infliction of emotional pain. What Baumbach does is something rare and exceedingly compassionate; he makes us like these two people as a couple in the opening ten minutes so that we can see how they could have shared a loving relationship for so long. The opening is mirrored voice over where each spouse narrates what they love or admire about the other person, and by doing this it's like we too get to see these people in this adoring light. It's like a ten-minute love letter and then it gets ripped away. However, by starting with this foundation, Baumbach has invested the audience immediately. We care about both of these people because we've seen them at their best, and now as things get more acrimonious and harder, it hurts us too because of that emotional investment. Marriage Story does not adopt a side or ask its audience to choose. It presents both parties as essentially good people but with their flaws and combustibility that point to them being likely better apart. That doesn't mean they don't still care for one another or have essential elements of friendship. A simple shoelace tying at the very end of the movie nearly had me in tears because of its everyday act of kindness. These are complex human beings with needs, desires, egos, pressure points, and we watch both of them struggle through a stressful process where they're trying to do right but that definition keeps morphing with every next step. If there are villains, it's the lawyers, but even they are given degrees of explanation and perspectives to explain why they fight as hard as they do.\n\nI have read several reviews that disagree with my \"no sides\" assessment, citing how the movie presents more of Charlie's perspective during Act Two, and this is true. The extra time onscreen, however, doesn't erase his faults as a husband. The transition to this handover is Nicole unburdening herself to her lawyer (Dern) in a gorgeous seven-minute monologue. It's a thrilling moment for Johansson as the character begins guarded and afraid of saying anything too harsh, and then as she starts talking it's like you watch layer after layer get pulled free, allowing this woman to open up about her untended wants and desires and to legitimately be heard in perhaps the first time in a decade, and it's so powerful and sympathetic and natural. To then think that Baumbach intends to portray this same woman as a villain seems like a misreading. The second act does involve Charlie being more reactive to the new obstacles of divorce, like being forced to hire a lawyer to officially respond, to start a residence in L.A., and to eventually be observed by an evaluator of the court. He holds to the belief that he and Nicole don't need the acrimony, don't need the pain, and that they can be adults when it comes to deciding their end. Whether this is naivety will depend on your own worldview, but holding to this belief gets Charlie playing catch-up a lot and having to roll with changes for fear of being seen as an uncooperative parent, like when Nicole's friends don't want to go trick-or-treating with Charlie present so he's forced into a second later more pathetic outing. We do get to see Charlie beset with challenges but that doesn't erase Nicole's challenges too.\n\nFor a movie as deeply human as this one, it's also disarming just how funny it can be. The humor is never cheap or distracting but just another element that makes Marriage Story so adept. While the movie has its lows, it can also find delicate and absurd humor in the moment, reminding the audience that life isn't always doom and gloom even when things are going poorly. The sequence where Nicole and her sister (Merritt Weaver, wonderful) are bickering over the exact steps to legally serve Charlie divorce papers reminded me of a screwball comedy, how the nerves and fumbles of the characters were elevating the experience into touching the absurd. Nicole's entire family is a great comedic array of characters including her mother (Julie Hagerty) who says she has her own personal relationship with her daughter's ex-husband that she wishes to maintain. They even have pet names for one another (this brought back memories for me as I've had mothers of ex-girlfriends still want to talk with me weeks after their daughter dumped me). The legal asides are also filled with absurdist moments of comedy about double-speak and the arcane or idiosyncratic rules of divorce and representation in the courts. The sequence of Charlie being watched by the deadpanned court evaluator (Martha Kelley, TV's Baskets) is a terrific example of cringe comedy. He's trying to impress her but she's generally unflappable, to hilarious degree, and it only leads to more miscues that Charlie tries to ignore or downplay to win her favor.\n\nMake no mistake, Marriage Story is also one of the hardest hitting dramas of the year. Because we like both participants, because there is something at stake, watching them tear each other apart is a painful and revelatory experience. There is one gigantic confrontation that, like Nicole's first confession, begins small and cordial and builds and builds in intensity, to the point where walls are punched, threats are unleashed, and both parties end in tears. It's a thrilling sequence that feels akin to watching the defusing of a bomb ready to explode. Baumbach never feels the need to artificially inflate his drama, so we stick with that observational and compassionate ethos that has guided the entire film, even during the ugly moments. These are two people with pain and frustrations who both feel they have been wronged and are in the right. They're both entitled to their pain, they're both at fault for letting things get to this precipice, and they can both acknowledge that as well. Because even at their worst, Nicole and Charlie are still portrayed as human beings and human beings worthy of our empathy. They aren't heroes or villains, they're simply real people trying to navigate a hard time with conflicting feelings and needs.\n\nThe acting is outstanding. Driver (BlackkKlansman) is sensational and goes through an emotional wringer to portray Charlie, trying to stay above it all for so long and losing parts of himself along the way. His outbursts are raw and cut right through, but it's also his smaller moments of ignorance, dismissiveness, or tenderness that linger, providing a fuller picture of who Charlie is, why one could fall in love with him and why one could fall out of love. I fully expect Driver to be the front-runner for the Best Actor Oscar. He even gets to sing a Sondheim tune and uses it as a reflection point. A late moment, when he's reading a particular letter, drew tears and got me choked up. He's always been such a visceral actor, a man with a magnetic charisma and animalistic sense of energy that draws your attention. He's finally found a role that showcases how brilliant an actor Driver can be. This is also easily the best work of Johansson's (Avengers: Endgame) career. Let there be no doubt \u2013 this woman can be a tremendous actress with the right material. She's struggling with her sense of identity, being tied to Charlie for so long, and \"wanting my own Earth\" for so long that the dissolution process is both tumultuous but also exciting for what it promises. Nicole can take those chances, her Hollywood viability still alive, and strike out doing the things she's wanted to do, like direct. Her character has felt like a supportive prisoner for so long and now she gets to make a jailbreak. Johansson is an equal partner onscreen to Driver, trading the tenderness and hostility moment-for-moment.\n\nThis is Noah Baumbach's finest film to date, and I adored Frances Ha. I was expecting a degree of bitterness from the normally prickly filmmaker, and that's to be had considering the subject matter of divorce. What I wasn't expecting was the depth of feeling and compassion that flows from this movie's very steady beating heart. It feels real and honest in a way that a movie simply about the horrors of divorce and breakups and custody battles could not. Baumbach's characters aren't just meant to suffer and inflict pain, they're meant to come through the other side with something still intact. I'd argue that Marriage Story, even with its suffering, is ultimately a hopeful movie. It shows how two people can navigate the pain they've caused one another and still find an understanding on the other side. Driver and Johansson are fantastic and deliver two of the finest acting performances of this year. Baumbach's incredible level of detail makes the movie feel instantly authentic, lived-in, and resonant. I was hooked early, pulling for both characters, and spellbound by the complexity and development. There isn't a false note in the entire two-plus hours onscreen. It feels like you're watching real people. Marriage Story is a wonderful movie and I hope people won't be scared off by its subject matter. It's funny, empathetic, and resoundingly humane, gifting audiences with a rich portrait. It should be arriving to Netflix streaming by December 6, so fire up your queue and have the tissues at the ready.\n\nNate's Grade: A",

It is a combination of a love story, screwball comedy, musical, and procedural drama. While the blend of styles at a point comes across as forced, the film as a whole is a brilliant work, telling a story rather than following the genre troupes many films fall into. This is a simple story originally executed. Extremely character driven, the cast play their roles perfectly. Scarlett Johansson and Adam Driver lead the balanced portrayal of a divorcing couple. This film will impact viewers differently depending on many factors, especially their life stage and past experiences with relationships, marriage, and divorce. The film is so well balanced that one viewer will relate more to one character while the person beside them may be more drawn to the other. Regardless of which lead you relate to more, you are bound to be shaken by the deeply emotional performances of both. A nod to the cast would be incomplete without a special mention for Laura Dern and Ray Liotta whose characters come to life in significant scenes of their own. The director shared at TIFF that at many times during filming he felt like he was watching the actor\u2019s movie rather than his and this truly shines through in their collective performance. Out of the many films we saw in Toronto over two weeks, Marriage Story likely has the best odds for this year\u2019s Oscar wins. #filmreactiviews ",

            "content": "BLAMER VS. BLAMER - My Review of MARRIAGE STORY (4 Stars)\n\nWhite middle class couples getting divorced haven't really set the cinematic universe on fire for many many years.  In its heyday, such films as Ordinary People, Kramer Vs. Kramer, and An Unmarried Woman garnered serious box office and Oscar attention.  Nowadays, it's a miracle if a small indie tackles the subject and gets a streaming release.  Tastes have shifted.  Other issues have taken up more importance in our collective minds.  Other voices have rightfully staked their claim.  So, when I heard Noah Baumbach's latest film had made its way to the top of many lists, I felt an enormous amount of skepticism.  Do we really need to see a successful theater director and his actor wife fight over which lovely home in which wonderful town they can agree upon to raise their young son?  I smelled huge blowouts around huge kitchen islands in my moviegoing future.   \n\nLuckily, Baumbach, always an astute observer of human behavior, knows people like me all too well and prepared himself for the backlash by inserting a scene in which a courtroom judge lays out the champagne problems of it all.  With that at the very least acknowledged, we end up with a searing, detailed, emotionally powerful, beautifully acted story less about divorce but about finding one's humanity in times of crisis.  It opens with a beautifully realized montage in which Charlie (Adam Driver) and Nicole (Scarlett Johansson) read from essays they've written about each other over highly specific scenes from their marriage.  The sequence ends, however, with those essays being presented to a mediator who presides over their separation.  Charlie and Nicole seem effortlessly polite and sometimes loving with each other, promising to eschew lawyers and make their split amicable.  Perhaps because they have a young son, Henry (Azhy Robertson) or maybe they're just good people, but their divorce feels\u2026nice.  We know that won't last.  \n\nSoon enough, Nicole has left their comfy New York home to star in a pilot in Los Angeles.  There, she's introduced to a powerful divorce attorney Nora (Laura Dern) who with her serenely cutting line deliveries ensures an ugly battle ahead.  This move forces Charlie to lawyer up with the scene-stealing Alan Alda as his council.  From here, the film starts to resemble a courtroom drama, but it avoids the all-too familiar tropes by bringing us those in-between scenes in which Charlie and Nicole hash things out in private.  It's a scenario played out with equal parts kindness and dread as each reveals details and motives better left unsaid.  It culminates in a stunning argument, a gut punch of a ten minute sequence in which Driver and Johansson do the best work of their careers to date.  Same goes for a matching pair of musical sequences in which each actor sings Sondheim songs from \"Company\", and, against all odds, it works like gangbusters.  \n\nIt also helps that the supporting cast delivers on all fronts.  Aside from Dern, who almost runs away with the movie and practically demands a standalone Nora spinoff project, I loved Julie Hagerty and Merritt Wever as Nicole's mother and sister respectively.  Wever mines so much comedy out of a scene in which she needs to serve Charlie his divorce papers and Hagerty, who has reached National Treasure status by now, kills with her patented goofball charm.  Ray Liotta has a field day as one of Charlie's attorneys, sparring with Nora while also finding these credible grace notes when the two trade light, personal anecdotes.  There's the famous quote, \"Hollywood is the only place where you can die of encouragement\", and nowhere is this more true than in the dynamics between Dern and everyone else with whom she shares the screen.  We're used to her delicious freakouts, but here, she glides on a razor blade and in one amazing monologue, she more than earns her inevitable Oscar nomination.  A special mention also goes to Martha Kelly (Baskets) who uses her deadpan delivery to perfection in her scenes as a parental evaluator.  \n\nBaumbach does some of his best writing and directing here.  Clearly he has taken a page out of the Woody Allen playbook of allowing for offscreen space and framing which accentuates the distance between characters, but he also deftly utilizes monologues and creates a sense of urgency despite saddling his actors with overwritten dialogue.  In lesser hands this would have felt like a bad play, but this film blends humor and drama so well, you may find yourself completely wrapped up in it.  I also loved the scene in which our two leads shut a stuck gate.  It's a fine example of how editing and matching shots can achieve an intended effect. This film could have easily slipped into cornball pathos, but because the characters have reached such vivid levels, it never does.  By the time it reaches its wonderful throwaway of a final scene, which could have gone the way of so many \"important\" moments we've seen endlessly, you may find yourself exhausted but completely in love with these flawed, unpredictable, and unforgettable characters.  Marriage Story makes the divorce movie important again.",

A devastating portrayal of divorce that can bring out the ugly in people, especially with child custody. But it's not all doom and gloom. It's incredibly heartfelt with plenty of humorous moments. I guess you have to find the comedy during the difficulties in life. Lets just say my cheeks wasn't dry afterwards.\n\nAnd yes, I wept.\n\nAdam Driver and Scarlett Johansson both gave masterclass performances. And I do mean some power house acting. Driver plays Charlie, a competitive and undaunted theatre director that he is very clear about what he wants. Johansson plays Nicole, a mother who's a delightful presence and loves to play, but is also a dedicated actor. This is the best I've seen from Johnasson. Her character delivers a monougle where she's explains the issues in her life that's all shot in one take, which brilliantly displays her acting chops where she naturally shifts from emotion to emotion - it was impeccable.\n\nThe supporting cast were all fantastic. Lauren Dern, Ray Liotta, Merritt Wever, Julie Hagerty, and Alan Alda were all brilliant and really bounce off the energy from Driver and Johansson. Even the child actor held his own between these juggernauts of actors.\n\nNot only are the performances the strongest element of the movie, but so is the writing. Every character is so uniquely fleshed out that the conflict feels so incredibly raw. It's one of the reasons why I was so glued to the movie from start to finish. One of the best screenplays of the year.\n\nThis is the first Noah Baumbach movie I've seen from him and I am aware of his other work, just haven't got around to watching them. However, I feel like this was the best introduction to him as a director, because he crafted such a sympathetic look on marriage dissolving away. We don't see the full relationship, but we do get to hear Nicole and Charlie individually describe what their love about each other, while there's a montage that flash's through their routine life together with their son. Nothing visually striking in the presentation, but not once did it feel stale.\n\nThe score from Randy Newman was terrific and fitted wonderfully with the movie. I loved the aspect ratio as it added a lot to the overall mood of the movie. When the two go head to head in the custody battle - that doesn't mean they're enemies. They still talk to each other as if they are still a thing. It's also hard to pick aside, because you understand where each of them are coming from, and even if you do choose, you still feel bad for either one.\n\nOverall rating: Any other relationship movie aint sh*t compared to this.",

Marriage Story aspires to show the viewer the real emotions and situations of what can actually happens in divorce so you're not going to get a plot twist. The movie essentially sides with the wife as they add the unforgivable bombshell that he has cheated on her. It also never lets him respond to the allegations that he is a smothering, self-involved idiot. She is portrayed as completely justified in blowing up the marriage and dude has to suck on the pain.It's mostly depressing. Any joy or comedy is quickly snuffed out with a new sorrowful revelation. Marriage Story revolves around the emotions and I cannot help but forever process the reasons and details which seemed one-sided and flaky.",

Adam Driver and Scarlet Johansson have turned in career-best performances. Laura Dern is a revelation, and Ray Liotta is quite good too. And then there\u2019s writer-director Noah Baumbach, who truly has outdone himself (I have not seen all of his films, but this is by far the best that I have seen). The direction is outstanding. Perhaps the most exceptional quality of the film is the writing, which is truly ingenious. Not only is the screenplay really moving, but it\u2019s also hilarious; I laughed out loud frequently. I also love how unpredictable and quirky the screenplay is, which serves to make the action and dialogue more realistic, believable, and endearing. The writing and direction remind me a lot of Woody Allen, yet Mr. Baumbach manages to forge his own unique style. This film also reminds me a lot of Kramer vs. Kramer, but I think Marriage Story is superior. This film is sure to be honored at most, if not all, of the awards ceremonies. I for one think that it should win Best Picture, Best Director, Best Original Screenplay, and at least three of the acting categories (actor, actress, and supporting actress). Obviously, I have not seen all 2019 awards show contenders yet, but I will be very surprised if a film comes out during the remainder of the year that is better.",

Remembering that Mr.Baumbach\u2019s background as a child of two divorced parents and the ex-husband of Jennifer Jason Leigh, it is easy to understand where his allegiance lies amidst the two parents vying for the affection of their son. As is so often the case where the writer and director are one in the same, this film could easily have used the input of a third party to edit and minimize lengthy scenes and dialogue as well as a choice in casting (since some of the characters appear to be more like stereotypes than real life individuals). One might argue that these lengthy oratorical performances by the characters gives them an opportunity to exhibit their acting wares and, true as that may be, it adds to the length of the film which could be shorter than its 2 and \u00bc hours. All that being said, I give the film a 9.0 because it is a heartfelt and brilliant dissection of the divorce process, those who exploit it and those who are victims of it as written and directed by one of its vital participants.",

A devastating portrayal of divorce that can bring out the ugly in people, especially with child custody. But it\u2019s not all doom and gloom. It\u2019s incredibly heartfelt with plenty of humorous moments. I guess you have to find the comedy during the difficulties in life. Lets just say my cheeks wasn\u2019t dry afterwards.And yes, I wept.Adam Driver and Scarlett Johansson both gave masterclass performances. And I do mean some power house acting. Driver plays Charlie, a competitive and undaunted theatre director that he is very clear about what he wants. Johansson plays Nicole, a mother who\u2019s a delightful presence and loves to play, but is also a dedicated actor. This is the best I\u2019ve seen from Johnasson. Her character delivers a monougle where she\u2019s explains the issues in her life that\u2019s all shot in one take, which brilliantly displays her acting chops where she naturally shifts from emotion to emotion - it was impeccable.The supporting cast were all fantastic. Lauren Dern, Ray Liotta, Merritt Wever, Julie Hagerty, and Alan Alda were all brilliant and really bounce off the energy from Driver and Johansson. Even the child actor held his own between these juggernauts of actors.Not only are the performances the strongest element of the movie, but so is the writing. Every character is so uniquely fleshed out that the conflict feels so incredibly raw. It\u2019s one of the reasons why I was so glued to the movie from start to finish. One of the best screenplays of the year.This is the first Noah Baumbach movie I\u2019ve seen from him and I am aware of his other work, just haven\u2019t got around to watching them. However, I feel like this was the best introduction to him as a director, because he crafted such a sympathetic look on marriage dissolving away. We don\u2019t see the full relationship, but we do get to hear Nicole and Charlie individually describe what their love about each other, while there\u2019s a montage that flash\u2019s through their routine life together with their son. Nothing visually striking in the presentation, but not once did it feel stale.The score from Randy Newman was terrific and fitted wonderfully with the movie. I loved the aspect ratio as it added a lot to the overall mood of the movie. When the two go head to head in the custody battle - that doesn't mean they\u2019re enemies. They still talk to each other as if they are still a thing. It\u2019s also hard to pick aside, because you understand where each of them are coming from, and even if you do choose, you still feel bad for either one.Overall rating: Any other relationship movie aint sh*t compared to this.",

Scarlett Johansson and Adam Driver give the best performances of their careers, and Adam Driver in particular proves that he is one of the best actors alive today. His portrayal of a father going through the ringer in an attempt to protect his son broke my heart. He goes through every possible emotion flawlessly, and he is so vulnerable you can't help but feel for the guy.The script is a work of art. There are no good guys or bad guys. No one is right or wrong. Everything is a very human shade of grey, and the story just made me think about how I view my own romantic relationships.

It's rare to have a film operate so meticulously in its characterization process, yet remain so fascinating and emotionally impressive. In many other films, you'd label it a potential issue to have your average scene length be somewhere between 7-10 minutes, and to have most of those scenes involve characters simply talking to one another. But these are very carefully constructed moments of build-up, allowing the audience to breathe these characters in and empathize with every action taken and word spoken, no matter how hurtful or diabolical it may seem on the surface. At the end of the proverbial day, we find we're dealing with nuanced human beings trying desperately to navigate their respective ways through a tragic phase of existence (a kind of death, as the movie so aptly puts it).

This profound experience is so rare, that it has happened to me only once. In Marriage Story.Marriage StoryThe writer and director, Noah Baumbach is spewing love. Not the usual way of expressing. But then, miscommunication is a major factor in this film. He is sugar-coating or bitter-coating a love story, by deconstructing, reverse-engineering a love story. Although that is what it seems at first. The film, above all, wonder me the most, is when it balances both sides of the coin. Every now and then, I think about what happened, why we are here, just as those characters do. It all makes sense and nothing fits despite the description, the definition. And still you don't feel cheated. And Noah dodged that bullet so effortlessly that you- at certain points in the film, even when there is no particularly emotional hurdle to cross- melt with a cathartic smile and tears, in its simple wittiness. The film deliberately follows Adam Driver's perspective. Now, that is a perfect choice, considering he \"is walking on\" something that he doesn't fully understand, just like us, the audience. Hence, he comes off warm and even pitiful at times, more than he actually might be or should. For following Scarlett Johanson would have come off calculative rather than spontaneous. Not something that the film wants to put out. It is vulnerable phenomena to be in. And to experience it, you should be out of control. Desperation is what drives the greed. And greed, something you keep it off the table from Day 1, is what it will come to. Not materialistic but philosophical. You'd want to be how you think of yourself to be. And in these scenarios where you are highly conscious of your decisions and acts. Legacy (Henry, in their case) is what you hold on to or at least fight for, now that you are sober.",

I love everyone involved in the movie so expectations were very high. But immediately, (IMMEDIATELY) the intrusive, BUSY musical score started to drive a nail into my head. Here were two monologues; letters written by the lead characters about each other. They were smart (if a little precious) and heartfelt and full of nice details. However, the entire time Adam Driver and Scarlett Johansson were speaking, this wall to wall orchestra kept sawing away, frolicking and gamboling like a Rossini overture underlining the moments with 'whimsy' and the promise of 'heartache.' Like a bright yellow highlight pen, the music left no room for independent thought: I was being told exactly how to feel about every second. But I got through the opening bits; although I didn't quite buy any of the director/actor theatre scenes- Why is that no one ever seems to be able to capture the truth of what it's like to do small theatre? Those ridiculous rehearsal scenes were painful in their ostentatious inauthenticity...and don't get me started on the actual performance of the play. It was almost exactly like that old SNL sketch \"Bad Conceptual Theatre\" - If only Dan Aykroyd had stepped out as Leonard Pinth Garnell to give a review - Even more hilarious was the discovery in a later scene that this awful slice of \"high art\" was slated for Broadway. In what universe? But I stuck with it until the scene where Scarlett Johansson reminds her husband that she finds it difficult to cry onstage only to walk into her bedroom and burst into tears. This is a moment that should've wrecked me. It's beautifully set up, and would have been totally unexpected and rending. But at she walks through the hallway towards her bedroom, the score whips up into a Soap Opera ready string-filled cry of anguish so generic it could have been used for that old Carol Burnett sketch As The Stomach Turns. The camera pulls in to show Scarlett's tear-filled face - but any empathy is immediately sucker-punched to the ground by the hideously OVER THE TOP music.Cut to: this morning as I scanned through the Golden Globe Nominations. Not only is that exercise in bathos and banality actually nominated for Best Original Score... It was written by none other than Randy Newman. Bummer.If I make it through the movie it will be with the sound off and the subtitles on. I like to decide how I feel about things. I don't need to be smothered in kisses to know I am loved. And I don't need to be swaddled in a treacly, syrupy, honey-laden, jokey, telegraphing soundscape in order to understand that sadness or joy are on display. I'm pretty sure I'm smarter than that. My CATS are definitely smarter than that. It's no coincidence that Bennett coughed up three yards of hairball during the first thirty seconds of the movie.",

When she gets an offer to work in LA, it makes their impending separation much more stressful. There's more focus on the husband, perhaps because his situation is more disruptive or because writer/director Noah Baumbach based this on his own experience. As a result, Driver is given the bulk of the heavy lifting and his character's dilemma (and his performance) is absolutely heart breaking. Johansson also does a fine job, along with a wonderful supporting cast, esp. Laura Dern and Alan Alda. It's good that they both play their attorneys, because the legal angles tend to drag down the emotional development. As their young son, Azhy Robertson is exceptionally natural. The film is slightly longer than it needed to be, but the subtle, excellent performances and Baumbach's skilled observations combine to create an affecting examination of the pains of divorce.",

One critic declared it is 'easily the most compelling divorce story since Kramer V Kramer.' I suppose it depends on what you consider compelling. There are plenty of other films about divorce but the one that springs to my mind is Todd Haynes' 2015 film, Carol, impeccably cast, acted and shot. Carol received a 10 minute standing ovation at Cannes that year and scored 95 on Metacritic, just one point more than MS (though Carol is a far superior film in every sense). There are a good deal of curtain-chewing and adult tantrums in MS but these don't disguise the fact that there is very little 'story'. MS is well acted but the characters don't really have much to work with. Their marriage has real problems, certainly, but good grief, what marriage doesn't? Basically, they need to talk more; she needs to be more assertive and he needs to listen and make compromises. Instead, they wind up paying absurd amounts of money for something that could easily have been worked out with more mediation. No doubt this happens all the time, but do we really need to witness the histrionics? Put simply, Marriage Story is mush in the same way that the weakest Woody Allen movies are mush. If you engage with that kind of jump-improv, indulgent, pseudo-self-analysis; if you like watching dewey-eyed, beautiful couples who have an almost perfect relationship talk themselves apart (leaving their oddly untraumatised child apparently saner and happier than either of them) then break out the popcorn and paper hankies.

Driver plays a New York-based theatre director traveling back and forth from there to LA where Johansson's character primarily lives as an actress that started out in film but now does theatre to support Driver. Any film that deals with divorce automatically hits close to my heart, as I come from divorced parents. I'm always interested to see how it will be portrayed differently in each film. And I gotta say, I think the last time I watched a divorce film that was so raw and honest about divorce was 'Blue Valentine' from 10 years ago starring Ryan Gosling and Michelle Williams. And while this one isn't quite as dismal and bleak as that one was (there are some endearing moments to be found in this one), this one still managed to portray all of the nitty gritty details and pitfalls that accompany long and bitter divorces. On top of that, Driver and Johansson deliver what I'd easily consider to be Oscar-worthy performances. Laura Dern also particularly shines as Johansson's divorce lawyer. Overall, while it's certainly not the first film to deal with divorce in great detail, it still gives a pretty unflinching look at the toll it takes, and that was more than enough to make it stand out to me.",

No, but that's mainly due to the fact that the root of its story is centered on gender imbalance.The recurring case in couples of: what I do became less important than what you do and it's quite evident that this is the main reason for the separation the film tolds. Maybe other things did their harm but that's the key point.The thing is the film walks again and again on that line without achieving a more interesting balance and especially for the little that both characters grow during their hard journey. Especially Charlie, Adam Driver's character. Ironically, although it seems that Baumbach wanted to show more balance between both sides, he does not succeed, especially because even though he allows Nicole (Scarlett Johansson) to express her frustrations at the same time as her personal and professional ambitions beyond her family life, when the time comes for the court fights, Baumbach turns Nicole's voice in court into a kind of villain. Her lawyer, which is ironic because her lawyer is someone who is really understanding what Nicole is expressing.I always felt the film was more inclined towards Charlie's side. For the rest, well I can say that I don't deny that both Driver and Johansson's performances are pretty good and I certainly believe that they will get into the Oscar nominations but their work is not really the reflection of the background of their characters or the story for that matter, because as I said, this film is not bad at all but its strengths lie in updating the subject in our times, nothing more, yet something like divorce we know that not only encompasses the issues we see here.This was a really good film to close this year and another success for Netflix and its catalog but honestly I keep saying that Baumbach is credited with merits that I simply do not see in him.",

It never really feels rushed with individual scenes, but to make that possible, important background details are glossed over and so are the characters. The characters aren't especially generic, but still somewhat shallow and predictable. The plot certainly offers some surprises, but is also mostly predictable for someone familiar with divorce outside of a fictitious context. Ultimately, the movie is thin in terms of portraying the course of a marriage and divorce, but there's something to be said for its success on that front given the run time. The movie has its surprising moments of humor as well, but that's important because even with humor, I came out feeling more pessimistic about marriage, relationships, and people. But this movie didn't opt for the feel-good, sugar-coated route like most movies of this type do. It argues that things aren't really ever going to be black-and-white and doesn't give us one answer to the issues explored in the movie because there isn't.",

What a great story about relationships and the beginnings and endings of them. Marriage Story is a flawless, heartbreaking story led by two of some of the best performances of the year. Adam Driver is phenomenal. Most people know him from the new Star Wars Trilogy but people should really see some of his other films. He usually does a great job but in this film, he is 100% dedicated to the role. They are certain scenes in the film where it doesn\u2019t feel like he is acting. It feels as if he is actually this character and going through all of these troubles. He puts so much emotion into his performance that it is heartbreaking yet mesmerizing. Scarlett Johansson gives yet again another fantastic performance. While her performance isn\u2019t as mesmerizing as Driver\u2019s performance, it\u2019s still perfect. She also conveys a huge amount of emotion with her role but adds a slightly more comedic and relaxed atmosphere to Driver\u2019s serious and hardworking atmosphere. Both actors play off each other perfectly, even in scenes where their characters are fighting with each other. Every other performance in the film is pretty great, especially from Laura Dern. The script for Marriage Story is fantastic. It compliments the performances and feels very natural. It knows how much the characters need to say to get a point across or when to restrict them. The music and cinematography are great. The music is done by Randy Newman (Toy Story) and fits the depressing tone the film is going for. The film makes the good choice of not using music during certain dramatic scenes which helps make those scenes more emotional. The cinematography isn\u2019t groundbreaking by any means but there are a lot of beautiful shots. Towards the beginning of the movie, there is a 5 minute uncut shot of Scarlett Johansson talking about why she stopped being in love with Adam Driver\u2019s character and it\u2019s great. There is one sequence in the film that is perfectly shot, acted, and scripted and it\u2019s the argument scene. I felt sad and a smidge emotional for the characters throughout the film but this one scene made me feel a whole lot. It\u2019s one of the best scenes in cinema this year. Adam Driver and Scarlett Johansson completely disappear in this scene. It doesn\u2019t feel like acting. It feels like the filmmakers just filmed real people breaking apart. The emotion displayed in this one scene is off the charts. It cemented for me that Adam Driver is a masterclass actor that people should pay more attention to besides being known as \u201cthe guy from Star Wars\u201d. The rest of the film has its emotional moments but they don\u2019t top that scene. The film\u2019s plot is pretty straightforward but the way the characters interact makes the film feel unpredictable. Noah Baumbach used his direction to make a straightforward story feel unique. I\u2019m going to start paying more attention to Baumbach from here on out. Overall, Marriage Story is a fantastic film about relationships and divorce with some of the best performances of the year, an outstanding screenplay, unique direction, and some great cinematography and music.",

This movie gave me the feelings of divorce and stubbornness that I have not went through yet in my life but I could see and feel so clearly in the movie. The characters played by Scarlett and Adam seemed perfect couple at first glance, then you dive into the relationship and see the cracks within. Throughout the movie I felt for Adams's character most of the time, feeling like Scarlett's just wanted to run away from a great family life in NY. After seeing her point of view and her family situations, I could totally understand why she felt so entrapped and needed to spread her wings and make decisions because she wanted to and wanted to feel in control. The ending makes it all feel so streamlined and connects back with the start of the film in a good way showing that maybe if she read her letter, all of this could of been fixed. The acting is what makes this movie and I have to say that is some of the best acting Ive seen in the big fight scene between the ex-couple.

We've always known ScarJo is an excellent actress but I think this is her peak so far. Many times the actors portray the subtext of a conversation or half-hidden feelings in a more true-to-life manner than I've seen almost anywhere else; so that we feel as though we are on the titanic, watching an iceberg emerge from the darkness with dread inevitability. When those feelings do come to the surface, it is with simultaneous relief and crushing loss.I often found myself thinking that the marriage could have been saved and that is why this only gets a 9. I wasn't sold on the idea that their marriage was that bad. This is either the fault of the writer for not conveying the misery of the marriage (although one could argue that this is outside the scope of the film, and the viewer is simply to take this for granted), or due to the selfishness of either one or both of the characters. The fact that I don't know which of these is the cause is either a minor stroke of genius or a minor annoyance, hence the -1. Being a romantic, I found the film quite wrenching. I recommend it to all who enjoy good acting and being put through the wringer. Some films hurt-so-good, but this one kinda just hurts.",

I have seen good movies but never have I been this moved to actually want to herald a movie the way I\u2019m doing now. How i wish there was more of what I see. Was awesome and sad at the same time. Awesome in that I watched a brilliant movie in a very long time; sad that it usually means it\u2019s going to be ages till there is something as brilliant to watch on tv. Pure story and emotion and not a single cliche!!! Thoroughly impressed. Well done from Director right down to cast",

I think what I like most about it is that neither parent is shown in a positive light. Both had flaws that inevitably caused the demise of the relationship. It was a satisfying movie, at least to me, that was capped off by an amazing performance by Adam Driver.",
