It's a heart-warming tale with an uplifting message about kindness, featuring beautifully unique animation, interesting characters, and a clever plot. In the sea of generic Christmas movies that get churned out each holiday season, Klaus stands out because it tried something different and it succeeded.",

            "content": "Okay, when it comes to Christmas movies to me there was only one: It's a wonderful life by Frank Capra. The Bishop's Wife and Love Actually are also very good but they don't have the same magic.\nThis year I can finally add a new classic: Klaus. It's a funny and surprising tale of how the real Santa Claus was born. I love the story and especially the look of this movie is amazing. Klaus is hand drawn animation but thanks to computers it has astonishing lit scenes. That makes the journey extra special.The story is about this lazy and clumpsy guy, Jesper, who is the only son of the director of a Mail School. His father wants to teach him a lesson and sends him to this little snowy place called Smeerensburg. Only if he succeeds in delivering 6000 letters in a year he's allowed to come back and continue his luxery life.\nOf course Jesper obeys: he doesn't have a choice. But when he arrives at Smeerensburg he discovers that his mission is an almost imposible one. Two rival families are at constant war with each other and will never send each other letters. But when Jesper visits his last hope, this hermit called Klaus, something magical happens. By accident this mourning figure receives a letter from a child and wants to return this nice gesture by giving the boy a present. Suddenly all the childeren of the village want to send letters...Why does Santa always say \"Ho! Ho! Ho!?\". How did he get his reindeers? Does he really have a naughty book? Why does he travel on a sleigh? All those questions will be answered in this great tale of one man, Jesper, changing the fate of a town that once only knew anger and never friendship. The end of Klaus is actually quite moving.Forget The Polar Express or all the Christmas Carols. Klaus is the real deal! Go see it on Netflix!9/10",

            "content": "Whilst I was vaguely aware of the title from seeing it mentioned at the Oscar's, I became aware of Klaus from seeing a large number of fellow reviewers highly praising the film this year,which led to me meeting Klaus.View on the film:Revealing later that he had wanted to do a traditionally animated feature film, but he wanted to see how the animation would have evolved without the switch to computer-generated animation, the 20 years spent working in various other animation departments, leads to co-writer/ (with Jim Mahoney & Zach Lewis) and co-director (with Carlos Martinez Lopez )Sergio Pablos make a chart-topping Christmas number one directing debut.Developing the project for over a decade, Pablos and Lopez ultra-stylised use of volumetric lighting and texturing, (first time to be used in hand-drawn animation) gives the animation a dazzling depth of field appearance, with the detailed, expressive hand-drawn character animation seamlessly blending in with the thick texturing given to the background and buildings drawing a pop-up book elegance.Later revealed by Sergio Pablos that he had improvised 40% of the dialogue,Jason Schwartzman gives a fantastic turn as Jesper,thanks to Schwartzman voicing his distinctive kookiness with a growing can-do confidence,whilst J.K. Simmons brings a merry, towering warmth in his merry performance of Klaus.Simply having a wonderful Christmas time in a miserable town, the writers gloriously take the characteristics of Santa (such as flying reindeer)and turn them inside out with hilarious sight gags that soar with excellent drama from Jesper bonding with the locals,and Klaus coming out from the wilderness, to discover the true meaning of Christmas.",

It is not even Disney-esque, which is also a very good good thing.That this \"Santa Claus\" is not the only main character is moreover a good choice by the writers. By doing so, the story is able to focus on how a mythical character could conceivably come to be - and that makes for a very interesting and entertaining premise.Everything about this animated story is well done: The animation is crisp and detailed; the dialogues are convincing and at times humorous; the music fits, is modern, and used judiciously.Young children will not probably understand the deeper meanings, but everyone else will.",

But Klaus it's amazing.Allow me to explain myself.There are so many reasons why Klaus remains as a classic.FIRST of all and the most visible one:THE ANIMATION. I'm not an animator but I love animation so I can tell when something is beautifully animated. Klaus isn't animated by computer, is hand-drawn animation which involves so much more work and it's worthy at the end because the result is so delightful. The colors, the details, the characters, the locations and every particular aspect are properly drawn, so you feel so good watching it.SECOND: You need more than looks to produce a classic and this film has a pretty good STORY. The plot is simple, a post man is sent to the unhappiest place in the world to deliver 6,000 letters, but in this place nobody delivers letters. Simple, the way that this plot seeks his way to include the origin story of Santa Claus it's amazing. Every twist is graceful and the ending is satisfactory.THIRD: animation and story are reached because of THE CHARACTERS: Every single and unique character has their own storyline developed satisfactorily.From beginning to end, the film is perfection for the Christmas holiday.",

As a disappointment to his father, the father sends him to the kingdom's far north island and offers him a deal to come back to the comforts of home after 6000 letters. The locals have ongoing feuds and generally express themselves in person rather than in letters. With a desperate need for any letters at all, he goes to the far end of the island where he finds an old reclusive toymaker named Klaus.Animator Sergio Pablos tries his hand in filmmaking and hits the first pitch out of the park. It's a solid origin story for Santa. It's not necessarily an original idea but this original version is executed very well. It has a great theme that fits perfectly with Christmas. It is emotionally satisfying and it has the potential to becoming a Christmas classic.",

Fit with beautiful animation, wonderful voice work, and a charming sense of direction, Klaus aims to please and does so almost irresistibly. The film, at its worst, may seem a bit formulaic, but is plenty full of many surprises without that will make you not want to look away from the screen. The film is also cleverly funny, with humor on par with that of The Emperor's New Groove and another Christmas classic of the decade, Arthur Christmas. What's so remarkable about the film however, is that, besides its ownership under Netflix, it simply isn't owned by a huge animation company. It feels small, and looks underwhelming, and like a gift of the same nature, is an absolute delight once you find what is all truly inside.\nMy Rating: 9.75/10",

            "content": "This is what this film feels like: sitting around a fire and being engrossed in a story that someone remembers from long ago. Is the plot very original? Maybe not, but it is well paced and has some surprises along the way that make Klaus special.\nHere, we have a sincere, funny and engaging film, that doesn't rely on ironic jokes to tie in the adults, or on the integration of modern technology to hold the kids' interest. It just tells a story.The story is about a spoiled young man who is sent into the little backwater village of Smeerensburg to take over the post office. Jesper has to deliver 6000 letters by the end of a year or he'll be cut off by his wealthy father. After he meets the reclusive toymaker Klaus, Jesper starts to plot his way out of Smeerensburg by roping in the kids of the village. Along the way he makes some friends, changes some lives and, well, grows up.This is, in a way, Jesper's coming of age story, even though he is a fully grown man to begin with. But this is also Klaus' growing old story. I found this apect very touching - the old and widowed hermit finds a new purpose in his life and gets to be happy for a few years yet. You do not see that sort of plotline in animated movies very often. The subplot of the warring clans of Smeerensburg was hilarious and reminded me a little of Asterix and Obelix.Apart from the old school, but very well executed plot, it is worthwhile to talk about Klaus' technical realization. Firstly, the animation is gorgeous. The lighting is magnificent. The look is excellent. This film looks exactly as lovingly detailed as a Christmas movie should. The handdrawn animation is very effective - it gives the film a very soft and almost canvas-like feeling, while still making good use of the smooth and fast execution that CGI affords.Klaus isn't dunked in polished, on-the-nose effects, but is, you might say, warmly covered in a carefully crafted blanket of twinkling forest lights and harsh mountain snows and accompanied by a little, gruff town of crooked and funny looking houses and crooked and funny-looking people.\nIn Klaus, we do not encounter a string of slightly altered clones, that all have the same body type and facial features (looking at you Disney) but a jumbled ensemble of big and round, tall and bent, young and middle aged and old characters, who all look and act differently from each other.The only criticism I can honestly think of is that Klaus lacks a little on female representation. Its central female characters, Ava and M\u00e1rgu, felt a little sidelined to me, especially given the fact that theirs could have been the better story, if told accordingly. But given the fact that I still loved it, I can't really hold this against Klaus.So, just in time for Christmas, Klaus is a thoroughly enjoyable treat of a movie that I will probably recommend excessively over the next few weeks.",

Why is the place so bad? It's incredibly unfriendly and gray....with locals constantly feuding with each other for generations. And, considering the locals can't stand each other, no one ever wants to write a letter....and Jesper has absolutely nothing to do but count the days until he can leave the place!\nOne evening, a dark and scary stranger, Mr. Klaus, shows up and demands that Jesper delivers a present to one of the kids in town. Over time, the traditional Santa myth is created in the story--with kids writing letters to Santa Klaus, reindeer and the whole kiboodle. But what about Jesper? His time to leave is approaching...and he's actually doing so much good.This is a gorgeously animated and beautiful film. I loved the combination of CGI and traditional animation and the story kept my interest because it had heart and was occasionally rather funny. Well worth seeing and clearly a reimagining of the Christmas special from 19970, \"Santa Claus is Coming to Town\".UPDATE: I saw this film again and noticed a couple minor problems I didn't notice the first time.

            "review_title": "Stamp and delivered. This Netflix movie was a wonderful well-made masterpiece. A jolly good time.",
            "content": "Very similar to that of the 1970 Rankin & Bass stop motion special 'Santa Claus Is Comin' to Town'; this motion picture tells an alternate fictional tale of the origins of the Kris Kringle myth, independent from the historical version of Saint Nicolas. Kinda glad they did that rather than digging too deep in the complex & highly complicate biblical story. That choice would bog the story down. Although I doubt diehard evangelicalism would feel the same. They probably would have love to see more of that or a mention of Jesus Christ. Anyways, set in the Far North of some unnamed Nordic country, 'Santa Claus is Comin' To Town' and this flick rotated around a postman telling the story of how a thoughtful toymaker brought joy to a gloomy isolated village. Although this movie written and produced by animator Sergio Pablos's company in his directorial debut told the tale much better. Even if the mailman named Jesper voiced by Jason Schwartzman was a bit annoying. Nonetheless, the postman did improve overtime in the movie's character development arc. However, the third act break up trope seem a bit overdramatic and harsh. Without spoiling this holiday picture too much, what he did wasn't really that awful. The other characters were doing similar things such as Alva (Voiced by Rashida Jones) a teacher turn fishmonger. It felt a bit out of character for her to get angry about his initially selfish plans when Alva was trying to leave the city at one time as well. She was really hesitant about wanting to teach the children even when they started to show up at her school. For her to turn her back on him felt like the pot calling the kettle black. It made no sense. As for Klaus (Voiced by J.K Simmons). He's no saint too. Forcing another person to break and enter houses at night rather than talking to the parents about the gifts is pretty bad enough. Yet as a woodsman who probably first arrive in the island port. He had to know that the whole town of Smeerensburg was involved in a generations old feud between two families that leads to lots of resentment. Also, I doubt he is that self-efficient. He has a lot of metal works, materials and tools in his workshop that wasn't made from his hands. He had to trade with somebody that wasn't Saami at one time for certain goods. After all his location is on the map. Regardless he still sometime in the past left the village to its own devices and selfishly move to isolate with his wife in the mountains. Because of that, he shouldn't gotta mad at Jesper too. That postman gave his life some new direction and purpose. Regardless the movie does a good job promoting moving past grudges and showing the importance of generosity, compassion, and teamwork. As the saying goes a true selfless act always sparks another. Even if the children are only acting good to get toys. As for the critics who be mad about this film deceiving children into believing falsehoods as it interferes with the development of critical thinking. Surprising for most of the runtime, the movie gives realistic explanations to a lot of the Santa Claus magical lore. Yet the ending gives into the idea that the supernatural might be in played. While the ascending to a higher plane of existence idea was well done for a children's movie. I just don't know if the film would had been stronger if Jesper took the mantle and continue the traditions that he founded with Klaus rather than waiting for his friend or not. Still the ending we got was a lot better than the delete version of them leaving everything for the North Pole. Hate for Jesper to lose everybody he grew to like. Truth be told he has more connection with the town folks rather than Klaus which kinda was a bit lacking. While I did love JK's limited voice acting in this film. The large amount of silence and grunts kinda hurt his character a bit. Schwartzman as Jesper was a little bit better as he added some child-like well balance snarky spoil brat charm with his adlibs. I don't think this would have work with the original chimney cleaner rags to riches plans. As for the mature posh English accent from the 2015 teaser. That's just jarring and doesn't fit with the younger man proving himself story that they were going for. Still the filmmakers made the right choices there along with keeping Norm McDonald as the wise cracking ship captain Mogens and having a real Saami girl Neda Margrethe Labba voiced the very cute Margu. Another thing this movie had going for it was its music. Singer Zara Larsson theme song \"Invisible\" was very uplifting and memorable. While composer Alfonso G. Aguilar score was emotional haunting. It was also easy on the ears. As for the visuals. The film was developed for nearly ten years, all because the studio wanted to create a new form of hand-drawn animation to keep the medium alive in the age of CGI. They got their wish as a paperless software was made that masterfully blend 2D with realistic 3D lightning and shading. The results were very crisped. It works amazing with the dark physical sardonic comedy. No wonder why this movie was nominated for Academy Award in 2020. Overall: I have to say this quirky take on Santa Claus's humble beginnings barely had anything really wrong to go postal about. In the end, it's nearly a total package. A must watch during the holidays.",

            "review_title": "Netflix saves Christmas",
            "content": "The Netflix platform once again proves to be a sanctuary for creativity and artistic soul, giving us a fine Spanish film that resembles the sort of Disney fairy tale that Disney would no longer dare to make, with animation that resembles Atlantis: The Lost Empire, and a protagonist reminiscent of the selfish Emperor Cuzco. Add to that some stylistically distinct backgrounds (fusing CGI and traditional animation with loving care), wonderful color schemes, and a moving message about the true meaning of Christmas, et voila: the best animation of the year.Klaus, the first animated Netflix original feature, does fall into a few of the traps that modern kiddie films tend to. There are a few \"hip\" music choices (God knows this movie did not need Zara Larsson), ham-fisted bits of commentary, and a \"Liar Revealed\" clich\u00e9 with all the misunderstanding and moping that must follow (albeit with some self-awareness). However, this scarcely ruins what it is otherwise a timeless film that already feels like a poignant holiday classic.We meet Jesper Johannsen (Jason Schwartzman), a spoiled and lazy postman-in-training from some unspecified Scandinavian country, whose wealthy father, owner of the postal service, sees through his deliberate self-sabotaging and puts him in a position that even a slob like him is qualified for: delivering mail on the secluded Arctic island of Smeerensburg (should he fail, he will be disowned). It is a cold, foggy, and socially divided place, where the dark-haired Krum family, headed by a spindly Joan Cusack, is in constant conflict with the red-haired Ellingboes, headed by Will Sasso. Each clan's hatred toward the other's differences is so integral to their family tradition that, as both sides unanimously explain, \"tradition\" is the only reason they still do it. I got the hint early on, but the film gets a little obvious.Another inhabitant of Smeerensburg is a mysterious, woodcarving hermit named Klaus (J. K. Simmons), who accidentally ends up receiving the only \"mail\" Jesper gets to deliver: a small child's drawing. Nevertheless, Jesper is given a package from the enigmatic recluse to deliver to the child in return. And soon, word spreads throughout Smeerensburg that Klaus will deliver a handcrafted toy if sent a letter; suddenly, children of all hair colours are bonding over a unifying myth. The film is functionally a \"Santa Claus origin story\" and they explain some of his well-known hallmarks in amusing ways.Klaus in the hausJesper also begins to change, and he meets yet more notable townsfolk. A woman named Alva (Rashida Jones) was sent to Smeerensburg to be the school teacher, but since tradition dictates that the gingers can't very well receive education alongside the black-haired kiddies, she was forced to convert the classroom to a fish shop. The wisecracking sailor Mogens (Norm MacDonald) guides Jesper through this strange society early on. A small Saami girl appears from time to time, clearly not there to squabble in the name of neither Krum nor Ellingboe.These characters are all enjoyable and - unless they're only there to supply slick, fast-paced slapstick or memorably hilarious expressions, which is fine - go through endearing arcs. Klaus finds new meaning in life when, despite past tragedies and losses, he gets to leave an impression on those around him with his creativity. The selfish Jesper initially spreads the rumor of Klaus' workshop to advance his own career and deliver more mail, but he discovers that a certain spirit he helped bring to the island means more to him than getting to leave. Alva goes through a similar change, inspiring Jesper.Although flawed at some points, Klaus gets it right in several important ways. Its animation is well-paced (shifting seamlessly between intense physical comedy and silent atmosphere), its backgrounds are unique (if occasionally Burton-inspired), its lighting is perfectly utilized, and its message is timeless on top of being just in time for the annual \"Christmas in November\", communicated through likable characters and how they grow. If I must make one last complaint, it is that we see hints of Jesper becoming jealous that everyone's talking about Klaus when Jesper is the one making the nightly deliveries. This (please forgive me) goes snow-where.It is funny, I think, that those who are most similar to the antagonists of this film are often protective of a given version of Christmas, insisting there's a war\u2122 on it, thus countering the unifying magic that this film confirms it ought to have (many groups get to share it here, but their members do so as free-minded individuals, and their figure of sharing transcends tradition, kinda like how the \"real\" Santa is inspired by several faiths). Is Klaus realistic in this regard; the power it believes Christmas to have in divisive times? I've been here too long to surely say yes. But it is hopeful in a way we all need this holiday season. (Some critics make the case that the film implies we should bribe kids into good behavior with toys, but I didn't take this story to strictly mean that toys in and of themselves -- or materialist gifts -- are the reward for treating each other well, but there is truth to the thesis statement that a selfless act should inspire another.)For many children, this will be their Nightmare Before Christmas. I am at peace with this.",

            "content": "A heartwarming, charming and gorgeous animated movie that retells Santa Clause's origin story in a new and interesting way, although it does stumble in some places, especially with it's familiar story that we've experienced before and hitting most of the same beats (but that doesn't mean that it didn't had great moments); some of the characters needed more development (like the schoolteacher Alva, who unfortunately comes out as a generic love interest, while still shines in some moments throughout the story), while others (the villains) can be considered average at best; music, which was 30% great, while the other 70% didn't stand out all that much or the composer is repeating the same music a couple of times and the dialogue was great and in some moments OK at best, which included jokes that weren't all that funny.There is one thing that i want to mention: before i saw the movie, i read some reviews and saying that the main character Jesper has the same characteristics with a another existing character in a animated movie and that character was Kuzco from the movie \"The Emperor's New Groove\" and how they were too similar to each other. There is truth to that discussion, since Jesper starts out the same way and act the same way throughout the movie, but for me - he did grow on me the more and more i continue watching the movie and i started to separate him and Kuzco from one another and Jesper did stand on its own as a character.I'll just say it, since it's the most noticeable thing in the movie: i ADORE the animation. It's so gorgeous to look at. All of the designs of the characters, the environments, the movements of the characters and the lighting are just masterfully made and the cinematography accompanies it and making it jaw-dropping to look at. If that movie doesn't inspire you to become a animator, then i don't know what can.I'm so happy that people from around the world are still keeping the spirit of the traditional animation alive and proving to the huge corporate studios, who abandoned that technique of animation (i'm looking at you Disney), which existed for far long than we can remember is not dead and it doesn't give up on a fight. That doesn't mean that i don't adore the 3D / CGI animation that Pixar created (which i'm so grateful for that), which also creating a new way to tell stories, but it's sad that we only get 3D / CGI animated movies in the movie theater and the only way to see new traditional animated movies is on streaming services like Netflix or in festivals. Movies like \"Klaus\" still give me hope and that's a good thing. I'm giving \"Klaus\" a 7.4/10.",

So I waited, followed the studio, the development, the videos they posted, became overjoyed by seeing netflix picking it up for production and when the time came, I sat down, closed the curtains, and started the movie.\nEvery moment of the movie, I was like \"this animation...\" because... yea, it's the crown jewel of this movie, the reason I was so hyped to see it, the animation is BEYOND GORGEOUS! Hands down a perfect hand-drawn animation by a Disney veteran and expert character designer with a team of the best he could get on a small scale. This movie feels like every one involved with it loved their job. The backgrounds, the movements, the lighting, oh sweet gingerbread, the lighting was just amazing. Every shade, hue and colour was just GLOWING and every background could be framed on a wall. The story itself is really fun, they didn't hold back on how the characters move, sound and interact with each other, the plot itself was quite fun and worked out the emotions just in the right way. The pop song felt a bit cheap, but hey, product of it's time, at least it wasn't distractive.\nThe ending got me a bit teary, it felt bittersweet for a moment, but then it threw that christmas warmth over me.\nThe characters, IMO were all likeable. Jesper is a fun, quick-paced nitwit that reminds me a lot of Kuzco from The Emperor's new Groove (down to the voice actor sounding startling similar to David Spade!), Klaus is a stoic, large figure with a little bit of sadness but plenty of space for joy, and J. K. Simons was a amtch made in heaven for that. The side characters were also lovely, especialy the antagonists. The movie also worked perfectly the subtle colour palette between the clans to make it pretty visible which citizen was from which clan (and I loved that paralel dialogue of the clan's history) and the character design was superb. Each character brimmed with personality and had a very original shape, outline and animation so they stand out in the crowd. In sum, this wasa holiday experience I didn't even know I needed so much, and another investment in animation that Netflix have done right. Keep up the good work, all of you. And I expect this old art to maybe find itself back into our lives, as a true act of kindness, always sparks another.",

Basically, set in the 19th century, Jesper Johansson (Jason Schwartzman) is the lazy and spoiled son of a wealthy Postmaster General. He is enrolled into the postman training academy; his father hopes to reform him. But Jesper deliberately underperforms, forcing his father to give him an ultimatum. He is tasked with delivering six-thousand letters within a year, on the distant island town of Smeerensburg. If Jesper fails, he will be cut off from the family estate. On his arrival, he meets sarcastic ferryman Mogens (Norm Macdonald) and bitter teacher-turned-fishmonger Alva (Rashida Jones). Jespers finds out that most of the town's populace is made up of the Ellingboes and the Krums, two warring families, along with many other miserable people who hardly exchange words, let alone letters. For some time, he tries desperately to find a way to post letters but finds no mail to be collected from any of the houses on the island. But then on the map in his office Jesper notices that there is an isolated dwelling at the far end of the island. He travels there and discovers a reclusive woodsman named Klaus (J.K. Simmons) with a house filled with handmade toys. Jesper is terrified by the large man with a big white beard and flees, inadvertently leaving behind a sad drawing he took earlier made by one of Smeerensburg's children. Klaus forces Jesper to lead him to the boy's house depicted in the drawing, and then makes Jesper secretly deliver a toy to the boy inside. Word of this event spreads to other children, each believe that they will receive a toy if they send a letter, so they visit Jesper the next day. He capitalises on the idea and goes to Klaus to propose he donates his variety of toys; Klaus agrees on the condition that they operate at night, and that Jesper continues to deliver the toys in secret. Soon, more and more children begin writing letters to Klaus. Jesper decides not to give a child known for misbehaviour and bullying no toy, instead leaving a lump of coal. He tells the children that Klaus only gives toys to good children, he says that Klaus always knows when any child misbehaves, and he has a \"naughty list\". The acts of kindness that follow inspire the rest of the townsfolk to end their ancient disputes, and Alva reopens her school to help the children learn to read and write. Eventually, Jesper and Klaus begin running out of toys to give to the children. With the end of the year and Jesper's deadline coming up, he tries persuading Klaus into making more toys in time for Christmas. There is a misunderstanding between Klaus and Jesper, after which they reconcile, and they work together to make a sled for a small S\u00e1mi girl named M\u00e1rgu (Neda Margrethe Labba), who lives in an isolated settlement with her people. Klaus finally opens up to Jesper, he tells him about his wife Lydia, explaining he made the toys to give to children the couple hoped to have but never did, and Lydia eventually died from illness. Klaus has realised their work has been spreading joy to the children and agrees to the Christmas plan. As the town and his relationship with Alva flourishes, Jesper finds himself wanting to stay in Smeerensburg. Family elders Aksel Ellingboe (Will Sasso) and Tammy Krum (Joan Cusack) want to resume the traditional feuding, they form a temporary truce in order to stop Jesper and Klaus. They trick Jesper's father into coming to the island, made to believe Jesper has posted fourteen-thousand letters, he arrives on Christmas eve to congratulate his son, inadvertently revealing to Jesper's friends the selfish reasons for his deeds. Just as they are about to leave town, Jesper's father notices his son's remorse, and after a talk he allows Jesper to stay in Smeerensburg. The elders and their gang chases after Klaus travelling with a sleigh filled with wrapped Christmas gifts. Jesper tries to stop them and apparently fails. The elders leave believing they have destroyed the toys and restored traditions to the town, however Alva had been informed of the plot by the town's children, so she and Klaus had already replaced the toys with decoys. Jesper is redeemed, and Smeerensburg becomes a happy town, with the family elders being forced to end the family feuding due to the marriage of their children, Mr. Ellingboe's daughter and Mrs. Krum's son. Jesper marries Alva and raises two children, and he and Klaus continue to deliver presents in Smeerensburg and beyond for eleven years. On the twelfth year, Klaus follows a gust of a wind calling him and disappears, seemingly to join his departed wife. Every Christmas Eve from then on, Jesper sits beside the fireplace and sees the spirit of Klaus continues to deliver toys to children around the world. Also starring Sergio Pablos (the director, writer and producer) as Pumpkin / Olaf and The A-Team's Dwight Schultz as Additional Adults Voices. This is a terrific alternative story of the origins of Santa Claus, with a postman deep in the Arctic Circle that, with the help of a toymaker brings joy to a cheerless community, and everything you may expect is covered, from reindeer pulling a sleigh, to children being naughty and nice. It also has a great cast of actors as the voices, and the animation is of course impeccable, it is a little darker than traditional Christmas movies, but that actually makes it more interesting, and it does warm the heart at the right moments, it is a worthwhile seasonal animated comedy-drama. It won the BAFTA for Best Animated Featured Film, and it was nominated the Oscar for Best Animated Feature Film. Very good!",

            "content": "There is no shortage of different takes on the whole Santa Claus story. Klaus is one more attempt to put a new spin on the legend. However, the plot is all built around a spoiled young mailman who is seeking a way back into the lap of luxury that his father provides. I did not understand how this was all going to come around to Santa, and at one point I thought it would not, just assuming I was mistaken about its subject matter. But when it transitioned to the main part of the plot, I was impressed with the way this film took ideas that seem fantastical and gave a real world explanation for them. It was such a charming and different way of approaching the various stories about Saint Nick that we've all come to know. It grounded something that is magical, and I appreciated the way it pulls that off without stomping on the legends for any young kids watching.I was a big fan of the animation style in Klaus. It had a look that felt like a blend of 2-D and 3-D animation that made me both nostalgic for the animated films of my childhood, and appreciative of the artfulness in modern animation. The use of shadows was particularly well-done and gave added depth to most of the scenes. The voice cast did a decent job, although I still find myself playing the \"Who is that voice?\" game which I don't love (when celebrity voices sound familiar and you end up checking IMDb in the middle of the movie to make sure you got it right.) I think there are a few elements in this film that are a bit overly ridiculous, but I was willing to forgive that stuff for the sake of younger viewers. There was also an element of the ending that didn't work for me, but by and large Klaus was a well-made film and one I could see myself watching again in future Decembers.",

Animated in a beautiful 2D-esque style that uses 3D CGI as its base, Klaus works backward from what we understand as the current lore surrounding Santa Claus and develops a heartwarming story to explain all the little impossibilities that tie to the Yule tradition. And while it hits mostly predictable story beats, certain moments had me tearing up.What makes Klaus different from the rest of the Christmas-themed animated fare is that there seems to have been plenty of care devoted to the artistry of the visuals. It seems like most modern animated Christmas movies skimp on quality just to get something out to cash in on the holiday. The characters and character designs are unique and fitting to the story this movie is trying to tell. I don't want to throw around the term \"instant classic\" too much, but Klaus feels like the kind of movie I'd want to re-watch with my children as part of some annual Christmas tradition.In the end, the plot does an excellent job of displaying character growth across all characters. Granted, this is how all Christmas movies usually play out. However, the fact that the most significant changes in the worst town were all started by children goes to show how children aren't just our future; they're the fresh vision that looks at the status quo and can change it. I will admit there is a slight taint to the motives of most of the characters, as none of them are that altruistic. That being said, in cases like the one presented in Klaus, the ends can justify the means.A quality Christmas classic, I give Klaus 4.5 stars out of 5.",

And...what a wonderful journey it is.Let's start with the best part - this film is GORGEOUS to look at. Pablos uses hand drawn animation with lighting techniques taken from digital animation and the result is crisp, clean and stunning to look at. I will watch this film again, just to look at the visuals.As for the voice casting - it is stellar - with one, small quibble. The great J.K. Simmon is...well...GREAT as Klaus. His deep baritone voice is perfect for the enigmatic hermit that is hiding secrets - and a heart of gold. Rashida Jones, Will Sasso, Norm MacDonald and the always brilliant Joan Cusack add their tremendous voices to the proceedings very well. My only quibble is with the work of Jason Schwartzman as Jesper, the character we follow throughout the film. I found his voice and character grating at times (I know this is on purpose, so Schwartzman did a good job in his work) but, I would have liked to have Pablos \"tone down\" the lead character just a bit.But that is a \"quibble\" in a very entertaining movie that is a wonderful family film that can be enjoyed on different levels - and for different reasons - by children and adults alike.Letter Grade: A-8 Stars (out of 10) and you can take that to the Bank(ofMarquis)",

The plot has enough going on and the pace is swift enough to leave no lulls in the movie, and it is a film that everyone can enjoy (a daunting challenge). The heart of the story is easy for young kids to understand, but even the use of simpler tropes in the movie are referenced as clever meta humor so that no elements feel stale to adults. The development of Jesper and his goal is a perfect representation of one of the main messages: early on, it's a fun adventure to reach 6,000 letters, but you quickly see the effect he's having on the town and how his priorities shift. His realization that while his old life is materially appealing, it truly doesn't compare in satisfaction to his new life because what matters is really what he can do for others and the people he loves. Life doesn't need to fit an expected mold, but can be something freeing and unexpected. Klaus is a great character and a very fun origin for Santa, and Alva's transformation to loving teaching the kids was great. Their romance was great because while it was fitting, it wasn't played overly dramatically but presented as a natural occurrence, which was refreshing. The two moments where Jesper makes the plan to get the letters and then tells the mean kid about the naughty list followed by rap music playing were both hilarious. The animation is great, particularly in how the town transitions from gray to light over time. The climax and ending are great, with plenty of tension but a purely joyful finish.

The storyline for this picture is around a spoiled brat whose father has had his last straw supporting him. The father works with the postal service and has his son sent to a desolate small town to serve as postman. He arrives and finds two poor sides of the town that are at odds with each other and constantly fighting and a recluse that lives outside of town and wants to be left alone. As he gets to know the recluse, the postman has an idea to get the town to stop fighting and create something new and special.This movie is codirected by Sergio Pablos and Carlos Mart\u00ednez L\u00f3pez in both of their directorial debuts and contains the voices of Jason Schwartzman (Rushmore), JK Simmons (Spider-Man), Norm MacDonald (Billy Madison), Joan Cusack (Working Girl) and Rashida Jones (The Social Network).The storyline for this picture is very unique with fantastic settings, characters and circumstances. The dialogue was also good as was the animation which was fantastic. The voices are perfectly selected and the fight and action scenes are awesome. The Klaus backstory was outstanding.Overall this is a magnificent addition to the Christmas genre that I would score an easy 10/10. I would strongly recommend seeing this.",

            "content": "'Klaus (2019)' is essentially a demystified 'Santa Claus' origin story and it's as formulaic as you'd, perhaps, expect. It's also just delightful. Its predictability can't prevent it from being good and, boy, is it good. It's an enjoyable, effective and visually striking animation with a kind heart and a gentle spirit. It sidesteps the sloppy sentimentality usually associated with 'Christmas' movies in favour of, essentially, a subtler sort of the same thing. Its 'Christmas spirit' is strong but well-earned, sweet but not sickly. The movie is just a joy, in general. It's fun, fast-paced and aesthetically distinct, brought to life with a beautiful 2D-3D blend. It doesn't feel entirely typical, either, thanks to its endearingly strange setting and relatively well-realised characters. It makes a couple of very minor missteps - such as a second-act lull in pace and a slightly odd ending - but it's ultimately a thoroughly entertaining experience. 7/10",

Pablos goes old-school by employing traditional hand-drawn animation and the wizardry he conjures on the canvas provides his film a unique look.What's more commendable is that despite the groundbreaking animation, it's the story & characters that take precedence. The premise is heartwarming, characters are well-defined & it is cleverly witted. The frozen, faraway setting is perfect spot for origins of Christmas myth, and the way the cold palettes transition to warmer tones as plot progresses is mesmerising to watch.On an overall scale, Klaus is a beautifully evocative & emotionally resonant tale of goodwill & compassion that's sprinkled with healthy dose of heart & humour and comes enveloped with magical flair. A hilarious, heartfelt & joyous celebration of the good deeds that bring us together, Klaus is a blissful marriage of storytelling & animation mastery, and is arguably the best animated film of the year.

This is a truly inventive, good-hearted Christmas film.The film uses old-fashioned animation with digital techniques to bring a 2 1/2D look to it. This looks AMAZING. I don't think I've seen something quite like this. The painted appearance to the backgrounds and characters looks great. The designs of the characters and locales are all distinctive, especially the characters. There is a wide cast here and they are so stylistically designed. The movie takes place around this town where two clans are at war. The townspeople are such a wonderfully diverse group of grotesques. I also loved the look of Klaus (voiced by J.K. Simmons) who is given a large, broad-shouldered figure. The character movement is also really fluid.The story is equally good. Although the film ultimately goes the way you predict it will, the storytelling in this is so well done that it doesn't much matter. The idea of the story of Santa Claus being told through non-magical reasons and happening through the actions of a postman is definitely something different from most attempts at Santa origin stories. The warring clans part brings a nice dab of dark humor while the sentimental bits are done nicely. All the characters are likable.I highly recommend you check this out. This is just a really well-done family Christmas movie.",

Simmons, Jason Schwartzman, Rashida Jones, Joan Cusack and Norm MacDonald.The film is Sergio Pablos' directorial debut. You may know some of his previous work as a writer for \"Despicable Me,\" and working in the animation department on other classics like \"Rio,\" \"Tarzan,\" \"Treasure Planet\" and others.The film has a beautiful 2D aesthetic harkening back to the classics of yesteryear. The animation is fresh and visually pleasing. The stylistic depictions accentuate the story of the town of Smeerensburg (essentially the North Pole) and its Hatfield-vs-McCoy inhabitants feuding for the sake of feuding.The story follows Jesper (Schwartzman), a mailman with his final chance to prove to his father he can hack it before he is cut off from his cushy existence. By chance, Jesper happens upon Klaus (Simmons), a woodsman and toymaker in a previous life, who has only ever wanted to see his toys bring joy to little children. The final piece are the children who would love nothing more than to have a brand new toy to play with. The three pieces like cogs in a clock work together to birth the Santa Klaus mythologies as needy kids begin receiving their presents.As the film progresses a main theme emerges, \"a true, selfless act always sparks another.\" A kind of \"love wins\" over the neverending feuds and backward traditions that have persisted here for so long. The acts of giving to one another results in new bonds formed and old differences fading away.It is a wonderful message to attach to Christmas for children and adults alike.

            "review_title": "Overhyped but Generously Sweet",
            "content": "Traditionally animated films have become far and few in recent years, so whenever a new one comes out, it gets immediate buzz from animation enthusiasts waiting for the next big innovative change in the media. One film that got said attention is Klaus, a modern retelling of the Santa Claus myth from Sergio Pablos, creator of Despicable Me and Smallfoot. Partially made at his Spanish facilities SPA Studios and released on Netflix (in addition to select theaters) this month, the movie itself is a perfect example of a decent film that was unfortunately tainted by overhype.The plot revolves around a postman named Jesper who is stationed in the Northern town of Smeerensburg, which is overrun with hatred from the conflicting Krums and Ellingboes. While in need to sending letters to meet a quota, he befriends a reclusive toy-maker and then slowly finds the true meaning of good will towards all. From that description alone reveals the film's weakest element: the story. The plot has been done before and has so many cliches spread out just to keep it going, from the main character becoming more accepting of the big changes in his life, to the main relationships starting off rocky before gaining the right trust, to an obvious love interest who changes her mind on how to live, and even the whole liar revealed arc. It doesn't help that Jesper is kind of unlikable during the first half due to his petty behavior and egocentric sardonicism, making him hard to connect to until he learns more about the meaning of hospitality. As a result, the feature lacks much surprises and is very predictable from start to finish.With all that said though, the one saving grace in the film's narrative is the overall heart. As the film details the act of good will towards people to lead better lives, it feels very earnest in its intent on doing selfless acts for the greater good of those who you befriended. That actually leads into the character of Klaus himself, who may seem like the average stoic woodsman with a softness hidden within, but his origins give more depth and substance than most renditions of Santa Claus before him, making him a great example of performing deeds through generosity and kindness. Speaking of the other characters, Alva and Mogens offer a good amount of spunk and sarcasm to make their appearances at least enjoyable, but the villains Krum and Ellingboe lack any originality past their hellbent wishes to keep their old hate field traditions. The most distinctive character in the film is Margu, a young Saami girl who acts more as the cutesy admirer of Jesper and Klaus since she wishes to help carry out the spirit of Christmas through means of goodwill to her heroes.Now even though the film may be underwhelming in terms of story, at least the animation makes the experience worthwhile. With a lot of talented character animators on board, they breathed a lot of life in the characters through strong acting and appealing designs. Their cute and cartoony designs blend in well with the cool and somberly colorful environments, which look like they came straight out of a children's book. There are shots in the film that feel like pure concept art, with flat albeit rich textures, soothing scenery and angular proportions that are fun to view. In addition to the animators, the film's cast like Jason Schwartzman, J.K. Simmons, Rashida Jones and Joan Cusack gave more personality and spontaneity to their characters than the generic plot ever could. Finally, the music score by Alfonso Aguilar is very pleasing and calming given the feature's intentional sweet nature, but some of the song choices are flat out stupid. The end song is ok as far as routine pop songs go, but did we need to hear an out of place rap song in an otherwise rich looking Nordic tale?So Klaus may not have been the next big hand-drawn film we were all looking for due to its weak story and hit or miss characters, but at least the colorful animation, charming voice acting and message of good will can offer something in return. Personally, I feel like this is best suited for children, because they'll gain a lot more from this growing up then most adults and teenagers would; it could be their first time learning about why we must care for one another. In this world consumed by hate, greed and cynicism, at least we have beacons like this to remind us why we live and breathe.",

The concept of Santa Klaus or celebrating Christmas were delightfully presented in a universal point of view, transcending faith.In Hebrew there is a saying: \"Proper behavior precedes the Torah\". Replace the word \"Torah\" with \"Tradition\" or \"Customs\" or anything along the lines, and this is the moral of the story beautifully taught in this movie!",

            "content": "Most of this year's Netflix releases have been bland and boring but I'm glad to say that Klaus is the exact opposite. I am confident in saying that this could become a Christmas classic although I had some issues that are common in Christmas related films. The story is a little simplistic. I know that it's more for children but I wish that these stories had a little more depth and more ideas presented. Even though the story is simplistic, it is still engaging. I was never bored throughout the course of the film and I was always interested in the characters and what they were doing. For a Christmas film, the characters are pretty good. The villains are kind of boring but the rest of the characters have their own interesting arc that they go through. This is boosted by some great voice acting from Jason Schwartzman, Rashida Jones, and J.K. Simmons who plays Klaus in the movie. Simmons gives the best performance in the film by far. Jason Schwartzman does a pretty good job although he was given a Christmas cliche that did annoy me. It's the standard cliche of a character has different motives that change before the end and has a misunderstanding with the other characters who ignore him. That happens in this film and it was a little obnoxious. Some of the music choices were pretty weird too. They decided to create an original song for the film and it didn't fit it that well in my opinion. The animation is beautiful in Klaus. It's all hand drawn animation and it reminded me of classic Disney films. The design of the town was pretty great and interesting with all these different characters doing different things. There were some jokes thrown into the film and some of them weren't that funny but the funniest ones were the jokes you can see in the background. All of these little visual cues were hilarious in my opinion. There is a lot of heart to this film. I was surprised at how much joy I felt when watching this and the ending was fantastic. It's sad and joyful at the same time. This is a film I will probably start watching every Christmas. It's a satisfying origin story to Santa Claus. Overall, Klaus may be a little too simplistic with weird music choices but its heart, animation, and voice acting make this an instant Christmas classic.",

The story takes place in the 19th century in what appears to be a country in Northern Europe (likely Norway). Jesper Johanssen (Jason Schwartzman) is the lazy and unambitious son of the Postmaster General who is stationed to the remote and unpleasant town of Smeerensburg as punishment for his poor work ethic as a mailman in training. Jesper arrives in a town long torn apart by a rivalry between two families and is simply looking for a way out until he chances upon Klaus (J.K. Simmons) the lonely and reclusive lumberman who likes outside the town. As Jesper needs to reach a quota of delivered letters before he is allowed to leave Smeerensburg he begins mailing letters from children to Klaus who begins delivering presents to the children of Smeerensburg. Soon the longstanding sectarianism between the two families begins to fade. I really enjoyed this story and found it a clever and inventive take on how Santa Claus came to be. The animation was very pretty and it just had an all around good feeling about it. Klaus comes highly recommended for children and adults.",

What a wonderful film, the animation has that classic touch to it, and the story is original and heartwarming. A new twist to Santa's origin story with this one and I absolutely love it. It's heartbreakingly realistic, yet magical. I love the character of Klaus and when it's time to join his wife on the other side, the tears just started streaming down. The final line that Jesper says that he gets to see his best friend once every year, it just shattered my heart into a million pieces (in a good way).What has left me in awe is the storytelling. This is Pixar level good storytelling perhaps even beyond that. They deliver such an impactful tale in a childlike, innocent way - a way that hasn't been seen since the Disney renaissance or Don Bluth's early animated films. It really is a film that everyone in the family can enjoy and love. The theme that \"one good deed, sparks another\" is beautifully shown as well as how the magic of the holidays unifies people. It shows how children are the heroes of the future, as they are the ones who ultimately end the rivalry between the black haired characters and the red head ones. Klaus' backstory is emotionally heart wrenching but he takes his tragedy and turns it into something beautiful with the help of Jesper, that is top notch storytelling. Honestly I could go on and on discussing the beauty of this film. How did this lose to Toy Story 4 ? That is just blasphemy. I wasn't happy with that win before watching Klaus, but after watching it, I'm forever bitter with that Academy panel. Shame on them. Still, people will remember Klaus for all the right reasons as Toy Story 4 fades into the back of our minds because Toy Story 3 was the perfect ending to that franchise.This is the film that the big animation companies should watch and take notes about. This is an original film, this is how it's done. Disney, Pixar, Dreamworks, Illumination - you want to make a proper animated film and not count on your billions to substitute the hard work ? You want to be as good as you guys were in your prime again ? You watch this film and take notes.Highly recommended. Congratulations to the team that worked on this film, amazing job well done.",

            "content": "I was really disappointed that this film did not win the Oscars for Animated Film. Normally continental European movies are 90% awful, and even their famous directors like Pedro Almodovar, Luc Besson, Gaspar No\u00e9, Bernardo Bertolucci, Carlos Saura love making movies that shock us and make us feel bad.For example, La Femme Nikita is an excelent movie, but gives us the idea that it is cool to kill police officers (who are always dehumanized), or 1900 which portrays insanity as something bold (like a peasant chop his own ear to show his boss that he is insulted). So with a mentality like that, which all those movies are incredibly cynical and nihilist, portraying people as creatures that are only motivated by illegal drugs, bozarre sex and destruction of any trace of civilization or good manners. I have watched dozens of those flics and they all end making us feel pessimistic about the world.For example, Pan's Labyrinth is also very entertaing, but it creates the narrative of good guys (communist partisans) versus sadistic bad guys (the Spanish government, represented by its soldiers). So in the end they insert unnecessary political messages.That is why Klaus is so different. An entire Spaniard production, they rescue some values from our Western civilization, that are so rejected by the media, but deep inside many of us, we miss those traditions, and many lf those previosly rebels, non conformists actually pass on the rituals of Christmas despite all the opposition that wants to desecrate one of our core Holidays.The movie is not religious at all, but a the same time doesn't fall into the American trap of making the movie gringey and disrespectful.\nAnd I was surprised that people in Scandinavia actually looked like they were from there (different than Hollywood now casting actors who clearly don't belong and make it awkward). That gave me hope that the movie industry still has directors capable of delivering pleasant content.The large number of views , considering that Christmas is boycotted by Jews, Muslims, Atheists, Seculars/Agnostics, East Asians, Hindus and Sikhs prove that there is a public that appreciate family friendly films, influenced by Western traditions, and shown in an uplifting way. Imhope more will come.",

            "content": "This movie is an outstanding one.I firstly saw it on Netflix but never wanted to watch it, because of how disappointed I was by other attempts on creating a good christmas movie. After one of my favourite YouTubers recommended it, I thought to give it a chance. It was the best choice I ever made.\nSo, here are my points of criticism.1. Story 20/20The story is the most important part in a movie. Klaus has an outstanding storyline, which combines a classic Christmas story with an original one. I really loved the idea to put a Mailman as the protagonist to give the story a different taste and twist. Not going to spoil the movie though, just so you know, great story!2. Animation 20/20This movie's animation is incredible. I was blown away by the art style and the 3D ffect though lightning. Really clever way of combining a rather oldschool drawing style movie and also combine it with modern technology. Great job. And ever since Disney complitely gave up on animations and started focusing on real life dramatory, I found this movie to be the perfect \"New Disney\" kind of movie. Awesome work.\nPS. If you are an animation/art lover, make sure to watch a few videos on the animation of the movie. You will thank me for that.3. Music 20/20\nNot much to say in there. The music was just great and fitted to the movie itself. You know how much of an impact the sound actually has, so no surprises that they got it so damn right.4. Voice Acting 20/20The voice actors in the Movie \"Klaus\" were all amazing and fitted to the character really well. They were all loud and clear and I could watch the movie in English, without subtitles (ENG is not my native language)5. Christmas Mood 20/20When watching a Christmas movie, you want to get that vibe, that \"yes! Its Christmas, the best time of the year!\"\nThrough the original storyline, the great animation, the music and the voice acting, I can promise you, that after watching this movie, you will feel like it is Christmas tomorrow. Great way of getting the viewer into the right mood,Overall points: 100/100If you read this after watching the movie, then great. If you have not watched the movie yet, do this like right now. Trust me. If you hate it, you can freely comment down here and I am going to be pleased to talk with you about it.",

            "content": "Why Klaus Is Amazing\nEven before one word of dialogue has been said you can already tell that you are in for a treat, the animation and artwork for this movie is absolutely gorgeous and it helps the visual storytelling by a lot. Before knowing what's going on the art shows us we are in a timeless land and that this is a remodeling of the old Christmas story of Santa. The actual plot is amazing, it takes many cliches but makes it work in a way where they actually work as good storytelling devices. Every single detail and point made in the story equal to amazing results and quality. The new take on Mr. Klaus was wonderfully done and with the addition of the art design it helped all the audience to feel like a kid again, everything that was once magical IS magical still. I dont believe I have ever seen a movie that told the story of Christmas in a new way and actually worked as an amazing piece of art. The length that this story goes with its new Santa is done magnificently, making him a regular human (or so we thought) not only made us connect with him more but also made us smile like kids to know that this man is Santa. The main character of the story Jesper Johanna is a regular post office man who helps create the Santa story, making him come up with the naughty list and the giving children toys on Christmas thing was such a wonderful surprise. Because we love this character we don't mind him changing the story, although it did bother me at first that Santa wasn't just a magical being, the ending made me really wonder \"was he really not magical? Or did I just not notice\" the way they humanize him is truly incredible. The wind as a symbolic reference to Santa's past lover is a cliche but works so well in the story that it doesn't take anything away and just adds even more. The wind being symbolic for Santa's wife and the wind moving through the snow, (which is connected to Santa because it represents Christmas which he holds dear to his heart) just creates even more amazing symbolism. The ending was amazing and really was an unexpected tear-jerker.Dislikes\nI think we could've seen more of the life Jesper had before he moved to the city but it definitely didn't hinder the movie at all and I didn't like the songs they played in the middle when they were all sad, but it was still great for giving an experience.\nMy Rating/ Recommendation\nI would 100% give this movie an 87-90% it is truly a sight to behold. This movie is a fantastic tale of love, loss, redemption, and peace it truly is a symbolic reference to our society today and is worthy of many awards in my books not only for the amazing art style but for the creative direction this movie took. For being only 1 hour and 30 minutes I was satisfied until the sweet but bitter end. Go watch this movie now!",

            "content": "Jesper is sent to a very violent town where the citizens go into battle every time the town bell rings. This is his punishment for slacking off every single opportunity so he can relax in his comfortable life. His dad forces him to become a postman in that town so that he learns his lesson about being a lazy bum. During his time there, Jesper comes across Klaus, a man who lives alone in the woods. Klaus helps him deliver a toy which helps lift the spirits of the child who got the toy.Christmas movies are hit and miss. Some of them are great for various reasons and others are horrible for various reasons. Sometimes, they may force the message down or have a completely misguided message. They may feel soulless. Maybe the director focuses more on commercialism than other themes that can come from Christmas. There is a lot of ways that a Christmas film can go wrong. Klaus takes none of the routes.Just by looking at the stunning visuals and animation, you can tell that Klaus is a Christmas movie that is filled with passion and heart. This is the most unique animation I have seen from a western animated film. The best way to describe it is that it feels like a mix of multiple types of animation. The visuals look hand drawn, but the I think it is 2.5D. It looks so pretty. The textures standout the most. There is so much shiny detail to every environment here. Christmas never felt so alive during animation. It feels like watching a story book for kids coming to life in the most magical way possible. There are even times where I feel that the movie is going in beautiful stop-motion. Visually, the movie is a treat. It also helps to have several stunning wide shots and some outstanding editing that makes scenes flow in such a creative way. The scene with the two families explaining why they are always at war together sits out. Two different perspectives are rolled into one bigger picture of the history of the families in the most fun and imaginative way possible. Not only is the animation gorgeous, but it is put to good use here to make this movie a magical experience.The other technical aspects are just as good. The voice acting is terrific and the musical score is phenomenal. Not only does this movie has music that screams Christmas, but the music just oozes with soul. It is the best musical score I have heard from a Christmas movie. The character designs are also clever. They fit right into an elaborate storybook for children. There were some character designs that made me think of the Addams family. Just with backgrounds, animation and effects, the designs of each character have a lot of detail put into them which help make each character stand out not just for their personality, but with their design which can tell you a lot about their character alone. The movie has so much love put into and you can tell just how much effort went into it from a technical level.The world-building is also important. At first, I just saw the town as a goofy way to bring kids in, but I kind of see the violent town fighting everyday similar to what has happened this year. There is a lot of hate in the world and it has magnified this year. The people in this town represent the hatred. They are always fighting, never getting along with each other and destroying each other's property. Even when there are signs of families treating each other better, two families want to bring back the fighting. The longer the movie went on, the more it made me think about the world in the film and how violent it was until the kids got toys. It makes the moments when the kids become happier with their brand new toys become that much sweeter. This might the first time they ever got something like a toy so it made them happier. This setting makes the philosophy crucial for the plot. It allows the story to thrive because of this world of violent kids and adults. The message is more effective in this regard.As for the story itself, it kind operates like an origin story for Santa Claus. It was great I was always wondering what would happen next. We see this little privileged bum who does not want to do any work get the biggest wake up call in his life in the first act. It is pretty satisfying to see everything that could go wrong, go wrong for Jesper, given how he acts in the beginning. His whole experience his first few weeks as a postman gives him one of the biggest pieces of humble pie I have ever seen in film. Then, Jesper meets a guy who would help change his view on the world. The friendship between Jesper and Klaus is gradual, but it is genuinely touching as it changes both of them to become better people. What makes it more interesting is that Jesper has some thoughts about his future because of the way the town changes. Ultimately, the movie is about bringing people together through kind acts and doing the right thing. Change starts with us. The story and characters reflect that.As for the characters, Jesper is a great protagonist who gets a lot of character development. He is also pretty funny as well. Even during the first act where he is at his most unlikable, he is too funny for me to hate him. More than that, he represents the spoiled rich kid perfectly. It makes his experience as a postman a bit more satisfying and his development throughout the film much more interesting. Klaus is an awesome character. He is a mysterious character who looks scary initially, but he is the most kindhearted person in the film. He builds a great relationship with Jesper that is touching to watch grow. The other characters are pretty interesting too. Some of the better side characters in the film such as the two families that hate each other guts, Alva who has a surprisingly solid backstory that comes to play, the most snarky tour guide imaginable and this sweet little girl who cannot speak English, but she does whatever she can to learn how to write it. Her relationship with Jesper is even better than the relationship between him and Klaus. This is a terrific cast of characters that is made even better by the wonderful voice acting. I jumped when I found out that J.K. Simmons voiced Klaus.The only minor complaints I have with this film are minor story elements that feel all too familiar. There is the fight between the main two characters and you see it from a mile away. I could not predict anything else that would happen, but I knew there would be some fight that happens. I thought the romance was very tapped on, even more so than usual. Jesper and Alva barely get any romantic chemistry until the very end of the film and they suddenly become a couple? This was the part that made me roll my eyes the most. They felt more like friends than love interests. Other than that and some other predictable plot points, there is not a whole lot of issues I have with this movie. It is about as good as a Christmas film as it can be.Klaus is an epic Christmas tale. This is perfect for families. It is the type of movie that sees the best in the world and we really that optimism sometimes. That is what I got from this movie. It can inspire people to become better and more selfless. Aside from its message, Klaus is just a throughly entertaining movie in general. It is touching, it is hilarious, it is beautiful and it is wholesome. Unless you do not have Netflix, there is no reason why you should not watch this during Christmas time. One day, it might become the new holiday tradition.",

What they don't tell you is how he had a postman sidekick that helped him start the tradition we've known and celebrated up to this day. Funny premise, but well thought out and tied together to its themes.The most memorable highlight of the film are definitely the main characters. Klaus (J.K. Simmons) and Jesper (Jason Schwartzman) create a lovable dynamic duo that's both hilarious and awkward. The film makes use of the established formula for conflict and plot structure for these type of animated stories, but it is well put together that it manages to pull it off without taking much in the way of excitement.Perhaps what makes it stand out from the rest of the holiday animations out there aimed at a much younger audience is its take on traditional values and practices as well as social dynamics while still very much being a fun Christmas movie. This is something that makes me appreciate Klaus all the more: the thought that went into the creative writing of something smart and exciting for kids to watch, and hopefully something they appreciate when they grow older.With the different variations that the old tale of Christmas has had, this addition takes the story of Santa Claus and gives it a new twist to create a more personal connection with its viewers with its lovable main characters as well as its comedic and sometimes heart-wrenching scenes. Klaus embodied and continues to embody the true spirit of Christmas in this wonderfully made and voiced animated film. Be sure to check this one out.",

            "content": "Here's a re-imagining of the holiday tradition of Santa Claus and how he came to deliver Christmas presents to good little boys and girls. I got a kick out of the 'lump of coal' treatment for those who didn't toe the line with their parents. I don't know how long that's been a troublesome mainstay, but it was well in place some sixty odd years ago when I was looking for gifts under the Christmas tree. The story starts out as a bit of a competition when a young layabout named Jesper Johannson (voiced by Jason Schwartzman) is assigned the task of achieving a goal of six thousand letters sent from the island outpost of Smeerensburg. Initially hitting the proverbial brick wall in a town of feuding families, Jesper is handed a lifeline when a burly widowed carpenter named Klaus (voiced by J.K. Simmons) decides to mail one of his many home made toys to an unfortunate young lad of the town. The idea snowballs, so to speak, and soon, all the kids in town are writing letters to Klaus to let him know how obedient and well mannered they were all year. With colorful animation in what I like to call a sort of wood-block style, \"Klaus\" is a fine, family friendly Christmas film that will join the ranks of other holiday movies as an annual event. In fact, after only three months since it's release in November, 2019 (as I write this), it rates a number five position in my list of IMDb viewer rated Christmas movies, joining 1966's \"How the Grinch Stole Christmas\" (#3) and the prior year's \"A Charlie Brown Christmas\" (#4) in the Top Five. So a word of advice to future film makers, when it comes to Christmas. clever and original animated pictures seem to be the ticket.",

The character arcs are solid, the theme is communicated in an effective way and the story is very solid, particularly the second act, which is where most movies fall.\nThere's a small twist after the presents are lost where it turns out those were fake presents. I think it would've been more satisfying if that had been previously set-up in some way. I also feel there was a beat missing in Alva and Jesper's relationship, after he comes back, some sort of apology to her.\nStill, these minor issues in no way shadow the super fun adventure this movie takes you in.",

It's not great but it's a heartfelt and honest movie about kindness and redemption that you and your kids can learn a thing or two from. I loved all the music in this.Jesper was okay, he was annoying at times but had a good heart. Klaus was the best character out of the film, being the most developed and even provides a few touching moments. Margu, the 4 year old saami girl is adorable though I couldn't find subtitles for the saami language? But I still liked her relationship with Jesper and how kind her family were to him.There were a few things that bring the film down, though other than Jesper's occasionally mean behaviors, I didn't like the romantic parts of the film. They didn't have much development to them and seemed forced in there, no different from other kids' animated films. I didn't like the beginning when Jesper first comes into town and everybody treats him like trash for no reason. This part is supposed to go along with the cliche of a protagonist who is hated at first but then loved. That running gag of the old man in a rocking chair getting pranked got old really fast, thankfully it was only in there like twice but still annoyingly mean. And lastly, the part where people get together to try to stop Christmas from preserving, I thought that was pointless and wish there could've been more of a reasoning why these people, who are supposed to be the antagonists did not like their town's atmosphere changing. There were a few silly moments like how toward the end was Jesper able to successfully avoid going back to his hometown when we thought we saw him actually on the boat?So overall, a decent feel-good movie that you can put on for you and your kids to think about the true value of Christmas and to smile at the most wonderful time of the year.",

Netflix is a little ahead of the game as it just released one it's now yearly holiday features, Klaus.\nPlot: B+ (88/100)\nKlaus in fact doesn't center around the titular character, but a postman, Jesper, who befriends Klaus and helps him delivers toys to a town in the midst of a generations long feud between families. At it's heart Klaus is a rom-com with the aforementioned Jesper and the titular Klaus, the two shouldn't work well together but they do, antics ensue and Klaus has a falling out with Jesper, who has to prove his worth.\nKlaus is adorable in it's simplicity and it works. The backdrop of the family feud helps the town be just a touch more miserable so the hope Jesper & Klaus bring is that much more uplifting. Klaus' story only stumbles during the falling out moment we mentioned before but the act turns so quickly it is more than forgiven!Performances: A (94/100)\nJason Schwartzman steels the film as the lead, voicing Jesper. Schwartzman portrays the arrogance & pity when needed, His performance centers the whole picture and is the emotional crux the picture balances on.\nRashida Jones from Parks & Rec. fame lends her voice to Jesper's love interest & the town teacher Alva. Even more so than Schwartzman Jones disappears into the role.\nJ.K. Simmons voices Klaus and.... does well but the character doesn't have enough to say to particularly stand out. When he has to add gravitas to a scene he does but those moments are few and far between.\nAll and all the cast is more than serviceable, Joan Cusack & Will Sasso also appear and are all outstanding, just completely overshadowed by Schwartzmann.Animation: A+ (98/100)\nJust WOW, I won't pretend to be an expert in computer animation but the animation is stunning. I believe it's some form of cell shading but done with added textures that completely enhance the experience. I watched it from my home and couldn't help but stare at the beautiful shots. Everything feels like it could have been hand animated and there is always something going on.Final Grade: A (94/100 ~ 280/300)\nKlaus is by no means perfect, but is so wholesome we can't help but love it. It's minor flaws are surface problems at best and were overshadowed by magical performances. More than once a tear came to my eye because of just how sincere the feature is. While it is a Christmas movie, it comes off almost completely non denominational & we believe it should be able to be enjoyed by nearly anybody with a heart.Please remember that Film, Television, & all art is completely SUBJECTIVE.

            "content": "The directorial debut of Sergio Pablos Klaus is an animated Christmas film that is bound to draw a smile across your face, warm your spirit, grab your attention hooking it to the screen and perhaps even find your eyes a bit glassy in more than several instances!First thing is first the animation is incredible; it looks like a beautiful marriage of 2D and 3D animation with each character flowing and moving with weight and substance in their actions and amazing facial expressions. Speaking of the characters each one has a unique design and feel that will stick in your mind and leave you in awe at the amount of effort put into everyone from the main characters to the smallest supporting ones. And the art style is reminiscent of an old story book you read while warming yourself by the fireplace fostering an impeccable atmosphere from scene to scene. While this might be Mr. Pablos' directorial debut he has an impressive resume of having a hand in animated properties and him and his team clearly have love and passion for the medium as they breathed life into this project from start to finish.Each character in this tale also has the phenomenal ability to emotionally connect and resonate their feelings with the viewer sometimes without saying a single word! With their voice actors delivering a multitude of expressive and emotive language that fit each of them excellently! From Postman Jesper finding himself in a miserable hopeless situation to discovering not only his own worth but the true happiness and warmth of life he never knew he had been denying himself. From fish merchant/ school teacher Alva trying to escape a hopeless situation of her own but slowly opening herself back up to the passion that widened her eyes and brought her smile to the surface even with the chance she might be hurt again for dreaming. From Woodsman Klaus just drifting through life keeping busy with craftsmanship in the hopes of not dwelling on the loss of a piece of him that made him complete and a future he was not able to have; to being able to reignite the light within him that she always fostered and grew with her warmth that never truly left him in the first place.While some of the story might tread on familiar territory it still has the advantage of being set in a time without current day references or catch phrases that would be sure to date it. Making this a timeless film that you can watch with your children, grand children for many Christmas seasons to come. And even if you do not celebrate Christmas it is a project so well put together that you cannot help but appreciate and resonate with it! So do not just take my word for it see yourself and spread it to those you love and even those you do not love who knows what new bonds of friendship could be fostered by taking such a chance!I for one hope it is successful for I would love to see more animated works from this team in the near future without a single doubt in my mind because this is art; art in motion! Thank you for hearing me out and remember;A true act of goodwill always sparks another ^-^",

It tells the story of Jesper a young postman who is sent far north to deliver mail and soon tries to bring the town back to life by helping a familiar Mr. Klaus deliver toys to children.It is a classic retelling of the Legend of Santa Claus Told with a unique voice and beautiful animation. The animation itself is completely unique by using traditional 2D animation and enhancing it with CGI to give it a whole new look. The characters are memorable, funny and relatable and help in bringing this new story to life.The voice acting is also great. Jason Schwartzman is perfect as the clumsy and often goofy Jesper and J. K. Simmons is perfect as the title character Klaus. What impressed me so much about this film on top of it's beautiful animation was it's heart. This is one of the most heart warming films I have seen this year that will put you in the perfect Christmas mood.The film manages to balance out comedy with whimsical moments that are poignant and uplifting by tell the story of Santa Klaus in a new exciting way that also feels familiar. It's wonderfully done and the final moments are tear jerkers in the best sense. It may be too soon to tell, but we may have a new Christmas classic on our hands that I could see families watching around the holidays for now on.Perhaps the only glaring flaws in the film reside in the films familiarity, stock villains and a few cliches sprinkled in. However, the film overrides this with terrific traditional animation, a wonderful whimsical tale and a whole lot of heart. Klaus is definitely worth your time.",

            "content": "\"Klaus\" is the rare Christmas film I can recommend to any friend who likes horror films and action movies because of its many zany, action filled sequences. Also, totally wholesome to boot, with spiritual snow and reconciliating enemies as well as a love story and a tale of moral redemption. . . wow! Plus, the animation is top notch, the character acting full of personality, squash and stretch, and the character design being fun and fitted to the voice acting, which was good too. . .The animation and character design did have a very Disney-esque feel, and it makes sense because of Sergio Pablos who wrote directed the film worked on Aladdin, The Hunchback of Notre Dame, Hercules, and Tarzan. There was also the animation master James Baxter (who animated Rafiki in The Lion King, Belle in Beauty and the Beast, Shrek 2, etc) who contributed animating some scenes himself while also taking an overall supervising role, I believe. The film is produced by Sergio Pablos Animation Studios (SPA Studios). In a Polygon interview Pablos writes the animation style of \"Klaus\" was definitely influenced by his time at Disney, however he hopes future works from his animation studio might take on its own unique style.Part of the reason you might feel as I did that \"Klaus\" looks like the old Disney 2D films like Beauty and the Beast is beacue \"Klaus\" is entirely 2D animated. This means all animation was hand drawn. But Pablos also says \"I set out to demolish some of the technical limitations (of 2D animation) as much as we can. Because we've had new technology that we haven't tried to use in 2D, so I was like let's give it a try and see what happens. The goal was to keep all that was great about 2D but replace what was not necessarily a choice but a limitation. So it would feel old but new somehow. But there was no attempt ever at making 2D look more like 3D. . . . The intention was to make this look like a piece of visual development that you that you would find in an art book for an animated movie, but put it directly onto the screen without getting into the grinder of the usual look.\"Saying that, \"Klaus\" definitely has a colorful, vibrant, high end animation look, with high definition ultra smooth colors as well as nostalgic character designs that feel familiar. Some scenes are especially stunning, as like near Klaus' house with them magical snow. There is also definitely that art book, textured painting look that Pablos mentions for most of the film.An unexpected hit for me, and way more complete story wise than most Netflix films has been so far (personally). Well done!",

I love the action, like the big chase down the snowy mountain, and it's hard to be too tough critically on something that's heart is in the right place as this.At the least, it's a far more watchable and less unintentionally creepy modern Santa tale than Polar Express.",

Actually, when I was watching the film I understood how the discrimination and hatred among the different groups pass from old generations to new ones.

After seeing it, I can definately agree that that it is good..........\nBut it's not as good as the critics are making it out to be.Story: Jesper, a bratty and entitled guy (which is different from the teaser) is sent to Smeerensberg after flunking the Royal Postal Academy. He is tasked with delivering 6,000 letters or else, he will be cut off from the family. Once he arrives however, he finds out that 2 families are at war with each other and have been for a long time due to \"tradition\" (*sigh*). He then comes across a former toy-maker named Klaus. After being made to deliver a toy to one of the kids, Jesper offers to deliver the toys that he has for free. They team up and thus the legend starts to form. Sadly the 2 families notice this and team up to stop them.The characters was pretty much the low point for me. Almost all of the characters, barring Klaus are just bland and cliche. ESPECIALLY JESPER. He's your usual entitled brat in the first act but gets better throughout the entire movie. He's pretty much Kuzco from Emperor's New Groove but even more unlikable and way less funny. Oh and WAY MORE ANNOYING. Even Flushed Away, despite the main character not being a brat handled this masterfully as well as another trope which I'll get to in a moment.I also like almost all of the casting except for Jason Schwartzman whose voice I didn't like. I liked the teaser and comparing it to the first act of Klaus, I honestly find the teaser more compelling.The 2D ANIMATION IS BEAUTIFUL. I'm glad that this kind of animation is back and I hope that Dreamworks and Disney pick it up again.It does get better in the second act with Jesper starting to like the changes to the town with the people becoming nicer and the town looking more friendly.But then the \"other trope\" I teased earlier kicks in and thus starts the worst moment in the entire movie. They find out Jesper's true plan and abandon him as he leaves. Yes, I'm talking about the infamous \"liar reveal\" cliche. I would usually forgive it if it was handled really well or even subverted at that point, but here it was executed so blandly and so forcefully that I nearly turned off the movie by then. EVEN KLAUS abandons him despite seeing how genuinely sorry he is and how much he has changed.The score was good but the song choices were weird. It made me feel like I was watching a Guy Ritchie movie.So overall this is a beautiful movie with heart but at the same time, its annoying and bland for the majority of the movie.",

Gorgeous visuals, very well done character design, great characters and character development. They are all very lovable! The soundtrack wraps everything really well too. The movie is great in making you.. happy.. and also sad at the same time. maybe this is a little bit spoilery?.. but there's a touch of bittersweet in the ending that i really liked. Almost made me cry(i was really close), you should really watch it for yourself. Believe me!I'm just so so glad that this movie reaally gives me hope for the future of hand drawn 2D animation... it's simply breathtaking, and greatly inspiring for someone like me, who is currently studying in animation and film. Huge thanks to netflix for bringing hand drawn animation back into the light. We MISSED those spark of magic created by the human hand. Don't get me wrong, 3D is still an amazing medium, no hate on it, it's just something that everybody does these days. As much as how great it is seeing CGI technology progressed in the industry, I really hope people won't forget hand drawn animation and keep preserving it in the future with new innovations like Klaus did.A SOLID 10/10 from me.",

Nowadays, the animation genre is pretty conventional by its storytelling.In Klaus, the characters are not as beautifully written as they are drawn, the screenplay suffers by making the characters' evolution to quick/drastic, and all that is supposed to be explained by \"goodwill\", I sincerely didn't buy that short cut.In other words, I think that those pretty interesting characters became too generic and too flat by the ending of the movie. Unfortunately, this is also a trademark of the director, Sergio Pablos.I would say that my recommendation depends on what you expect from this movie. If you seek a good movie worthy of IMDb's top 250, then you have come to the wrong place.",

In a similar way people can see any individual frame of \"The Snowman\" (1982) and know what film it is from; people will see any still frame of \"Klaus\" and will feel the Christmas spirit. In case that comparison is unclear, let me clarify: this movie is beautifully animated.Likewise, the voice acting in this movie is top notch. We have Norm Macdonald, Joan Cusak and Jason Schwartzman doing terrific jobs. And there's JK Simmons, who is incapable of doing anything but a stellar performance.In all the positives the movie has, the music may be the, ironically, unsung hero of the movie. The soundtrack and original song in this movie are some of the best I've heard.With all this praise, is there anything I didn't like about this film? Well, yeah. The story isn't bad by any means. It is just following a lot of the usual beats. There aren't many surprises to be had in this story. But even these same old story points are delivered in such a well done way, that you forgive it.It may be the same gift I get every year, but it is so nicely wrapped, and thoughtfully made.

As he tries to meet the challenge so he can escape, along with a kind, old, bearded local woodcarver called Klaus, he accidentally establishes all the legends of Santa Claus. It does this quite well but, damn, it takes its sweet time to get there. It's halfway through before you sense how the film has anything to do with Christmas, and it's over an hour before the C word is mentioned.Despite being animated, I'm not really sure it will work for younger children. My daughter Libby sat in the room while we watched, but focused on her iPad the whole time. There's some lovely animation, but it needs to be funnier and the first half draaaags...Christmas Cheese Rating: 7/10 - Eventually, we get some Christmas imagery, but it mostly avoids the cheese.Snow Rating: 10/10 - It's set in the far north and relies on snow to remind you it's supposed to be a festive film.Actually Any Good Rating: 7/10 - It is good; once it gets going.",

It is a lesson of selflessness, forgiveness, love and joy, things that we are sometimes desperate to find in a often cruel world. The message is sweet and simplified.

The local clan are annoyed by all the presents being given out to some of the kids.Klaus is a return to the more traditional animation even though co-director Sergio Pablos was involved with the CGI animated Despicable Me franchise.

When he is sent to a distant place, he is placed in a reality quite different from his own, and here Sergio Pablos presents us with a very peculiar reality. A dark village, people hate each other, people attack each other, all in the name of an old \"tradition of hatred\", between two families.This film became interesting to me from the moment the challenge was launched to soften the hearts of these dark citizens. And there is nothing more fair than starting with the purity of children. From now on, the film develops into a beautiful story, which is not surprising, because it is predictable, but because it shows something real: purity, values, family.",

Seemingly impossible amidst such discontent, Jesper comes across Klaus, who makes toys for children.Terrific animated treat imagining how Christmas began.

I wasnt really a fan of. Itsecond half was really good. So im kinda puzzled on what i rate this.First of all i think this movie starts off really slow. It was probably nessacary but the start feels like a totally different movie than what it turned out to be. This movie really had nothing to do with christmas until like 45-50 minutes in.Another thing is. I dont really like the characters all to much. They all have anger issues and it irratates me.Now lets get to the good things.The animation is very unique and really stunning. Honestly.. whats with christmas films and them all having great animation?The story was very questionable at first. Like its a very weird setup. But it worked. And it was actually a great take on the orgins of santa klaus.Voice acting was good. Everyone played their roles perfectly.Overall. Im kinda split on this movie. But i think im leaning towards the good side. Pacing was kinda slow. Animation, story, and voice acting were all great.So I will rate this... a..... 7/10!I feel like this movie will grow on me.

            "review_title": "Santa Schmaltz",
            "content": "A demythologized origins story of Santa Claus just in time for Christmas. Finally, a story of how American capitalism and British class fears turned an agrarian seasonal occupation of gorging and reveling into a family-oriented tradition of gift-giving money to retailers in exchange for debt and junky toys and, then, blaming it on a white-bearded guy in the sky made up by Coca-Cola.Oh, wait, that's not what \"Klaus\" is about. Again, a mythologized supposedly-partially-demythologized story full of copious amounts of perniciously recycled, predictable and trite schmaltz. Netflix enters a time-honored Hollywood practice of gift-giving lousy Christmas movies in exchange for our money. From \"Miracle on 34th Street\" (1947) to \"The Santa Clause 3: The Escape Clause\" (2006), we keep receiving these stupid Santa movies. I prefer the simpler past, when \"Santa Claus\" (1898) was a one-minute film made to experiment with photographic multiple exposures. Now, Zara Larsson's mawkish \"Invisible\" music-video montage takes up more time than that in \"Klaus\" and without even an innovative effect.Why movie critics, who by definition one would think are supposed to think critically and to have seen this cinematic emotional blackmail time and again, turn into saps for this seasonal sentimentalism is rather perplexing, though (it holds a 93% certified-fresh rating on Rotten Tomatoes as of this posting). I speculate it's for the same reasons that Santa Claus and modern Christmas exist in our imaginations at all--because they're so thoroughly stamped upon and become ingrained in the rituals of modern Western society. Regardless, after the initial set-up of a postman and a woodsman inhabiting a village enraptured in some absurd feud, the rest of the movie is so obviously reverse-engineered from the usual Santa Claus narrative that it writes itself. The humor mostly consists of the postman being emphatic and frantic and trading anachronistic barbs with others, such as the \"snail mail\" line. Even that is preferable to the waterworks manipulation. On the other hand, the animation, including some traditional hand drawing, is pleasant enough, and the pacing isn't too bad.It's interesting, too, that Netflix released \"Klaus,\" as the picture employs largely-antiquated animation in the digital age to mythologize the same snail mail that was the backbone of the company's original DVD-rental business. That, of course, has since changed with Netflix sliding down our chimneys through the seemingly-ethereal streaming. Even the postman sits expectantly in his living-room chair. Plus, they give us the gift of their own junk now. \"A true act of goodwill,\" surely. Bah humbug.",

No sexism, no politics, just good story telling.For Netflix to stay relevant, they need to keep on top of good film making. If they produce non-politically motivated hits that appeal to the majority like Klaus does, Netflix stand a chance to compete against Disney+ and HBO. If they keep up their \"woke\" productions, Netflix will alienate many customers (the silent majority).The first 1/3 of this movie is quite painful to watch as a one dimensional character in a one dimensional world become fleshed out. By the end, you grow to love and care about these characters.This film is suitable for most ages. Minor scenes may be scary for the very young.",

            "content": "'Functional' is the perfect word to describe \"Klaus\". Its story fits the standard three-act mould so exactly it could have been written by an algorithm. Watch the first ten minutes and you have seen the film.Jesper (Jason Schwartzman) is the only son of a postal service magnate (a funny concept, I'll admit) and leads the good life, counting on his family's fortune to keep him comfortable for the rest of his days. After the umpteenth failure to get him to work, his father is fed up with Jesper's indolence and sends him to the remote Northern town of Smeerensburg to set up a postal office. If he doesn't process 6,000 letters before the end of next year, he can forget about his inheritance.The assignment is more than a harsh one. When Jesper arrives at Smeerensburg, those parts of the town he can see through the mist are decrepit and hostile. He discovers the population is divided between two clans, at war with each other since the stone age. The surviving villagers are too busy pestering each other to greet their new postman, let alone invest in epistolography.Jesper is close to dying of misery when he encounters an old woodcutter named Klaus (J.K. Simmons), who finds a drawing from one of the unhappy village children. Klaus enlists Jesper to bring the boy one of the toys he keeps in his workshop, planting the seed of an idea. What if more children were to write this Klaus for toys?If you have ever seen a film in your life, you know how it goes from there. Will Jesper and Klaus set up a booming business, perhaps through a montage or two? Will they have a fall-out when Jesper oversteps his boundaries? Will they team up again in the face of danger? Will the rival clans finally reconcile? Will there be an unbearable 'liar revealed' moment when it is found out Jesper was only trying to reach his delivery quota? I daren't spoil it for you.There are three things \"Klaus\" has going for it. First, Schwartzman and Simmons, who share an assured sense of comedy that occasionally elevates the dialogue. Second, the animation, which could easily have been of the mind-numbing Illumination type, but has a sharpness and gravity that you rarely find these days. And third, the slapstick, which is spot-on.Such a shame these qualities are stapled to a script that feels like it was written by a somnambulist. It isn't even bad, just never more than functional.With the exception of some pop songs that will age as gracefully as a snowman come spring, \"Klaus\" is a competently made film. Your kids will like it fine. Sit them down to watch it and you'll have a peaceful hour and thirty minutes to spend on your model train set. Make them a TV dinner while you're at it. No need to challenge their taste.",

            "review_title": "Christmas Post",
            "content": "A Santa Claus origin story for Christmas, this animated feature didn't pretend that old Santa was a magically powered heavenly sent who was kind to children or a chummy old gent whose North Pole workshop of elves functions like clockwork to produce toys for every girl and boy and uses his flying reindeer to deliver every present on Christmas eve. No, this Klaus was a morose old widower, cut off from all of his neighbours, wallowing in his grief, no longer practicing his toy-making skills.Not that his neighbours are much to cheer about, being mostly an unruly mob of two feuding families with the rest of the townsfolk following the ebb and flow between them. These passive onlookers include a young female teacher embittered by her remote, thankless task reduced to being of all things a fishmonger, but into their midst appears a young new postman, determined to get the people writing and/or sending cards to one other, something that hasn't happened for years. Postman Jasper has been exiled to the back of beyond by his postmaster general dad in a last-gasp effort to engender some kind of work ethic into the boy who basically just wants to live a pampered life of leisure.Soon Jasper is building relationships with the peace-loving members of the community even if the two warmongering clan-leaders want to keep the fighting going on between their two families. Moreover, the postie finally connects with old Klaus, helping him get over the memory of his deceased wife and helping to make Christmas presents for all the young children again. There's also a predictable bad start / happy ending relationship for him with the afore-mentioned teacher and a connection with a young gibberish-talking, Minion-type child presumably to up the cuteness quotient.A pleasant, if occasionally dull and dry deconstruction of the old Father Christmas myth, for me it only really came alive in the last 20 minutes or so. The sung-songs in the soundtrack are in the modern pop medium and very much a turn-off to me\nwhile the bleak mid-wintery landscapes in the background and idiomatic wood-cut style animated figures tended to reduce the flow of the narrative. There were one or two neat transitions and some mildly amusing jokes but nothing to really make the eye pop or jaw drop.For those who want a no-expense spared happy-clappy, bright and colourful old-style animation, don't bother looking here. This, by deliberate contrast is rather earnest and modest but in the end just seemed a trifle dull and lacking in any meaningful sense of drama, emotion or warmth.To be blunt, if this feature was a Christmas gift, then after receiving it, I think I'd be seeking a refund or passing it on to a second-hand sales site. It has its moments but in the end left my wife and I with a little less of the Christmas spirit watching it than we might have initially anticipated.",

I love the tones, the concept, the story, the way they presented us 'the idea of Christmas' and the way they brought it alive. It was simply beautiful with good messages in which we can find it both enjoyable for adults and kids. For us adults, it might makes us reflect about several things. It is because, as an animated Christmas movie, I thought this one depicted story about Christmas quite realistic. It was not all about magic and miracle. It presented real ideas of human nature and real problem we might encounter in real life. There were several ideas I learned from watching this movie:1. Can human be nice and kind towards others out of goodwill? Or is human only acts according to the benefit of what they can get?2. War seems always born out of misunderstanding, the unwillingness to cooperate and tolerate differences, and sometimes out of the importance of several parties3. Love and forgiveness maybe is all we need to achieve peace4. One good act always incites another. It might moves or changes the heart of people. Sometimes, if there is no one, you can always be the first to try to do good deed.5. We can always learn and repent from our mistakesThat's all! Hope all of you, love this Christmas movie as much as I do. Happy early-Christmas :)",

            "content": "Klaus (2019) :\nBrief Review -Goodwill triumphs in this Emotional Roller-Coaster fighting against ancient Hatred. 'A true selfless act always sparks another'. Klaus is a sweet and entertaining tale about how goodwill and selfless act can beat out traditional hatred. But additionally it is about Human Emotions, friendship, love and choosing a right path. I liked three things about this film, first is when Hero declines his lonely lavish lifestyle for the sake of love and happiness he's receiving in a small village, second is Emotional Friendship of Klaus and Jesper and third one is the most important when true act of Kindness brings joy in horrible village and people start loving each other forgetting all the hatred they have for each other. Goodwill always triumphs no matter how worse conditions are, how difficult the path is and that's something i can never Dislike in any film. That's a full prrof formula you know and mostly many Animatied classic have used it perfectly. Klaus too does it perfectly with more realistically emotional stuff rather than using fantasy. The production design is terrific, the whole snow world, costumes, houses, school etc everything is good looking. Klaus has a pacy screenplay and the easy & innocent humour keeps it for entire 96 minutes. Most of the people liked the idea of Christmas used in the climax portion and even though i could not connect to it because of me being from different culture, i still connected to the joyful expressions of those kids and of those who made them happy. What film lacks is little high emotional stroke in the ending scene and glorification of a Postman. I didn't cry at the ending but i did cry in pre climax scene because more than friendship emotions i fell for human emotions. Overall, A Brilliant Emotional and Balmy Animated flick for all Ages.RATING - 7/10*By - #samthebestest",

A recluse postman named Jeester is sent to the North Pole due to his boat being stranded. Things change when he meets Klaus(Simmons) who happens to be Santa Clause. But will he go back to the real world?.The animation is really nice,the story is decent,the voice acting is good(forgot to mention the late Norm McDonald makes an appearance as one of Jeester's co workers). If you are a fan of 2D animated films then do give it a watch this Holiday season.Thumbs up.Will be watching it again in December 2023.",

            "review_title": "Beautifully animated Christmas tale",
            "content": "It's refreshing that we can still get new Christmas classics. Because I think this film has a fairly hefty chance of ending up as one. Animated by Sergio Pablos and his animation studio, and distributed by Netflix, Klaus is the story of Jesper, a privileged, pampered heir to an enormous postal empire, who ends up being sent to a remote island to run its deserted post office. There he ends up inadvertently starting the myth of Santa.The film is, first of all, absolutely gorgeous. Hand-drawn animation is such a dying art form these days, that it's always a feast for the eyes to see one, but even despite that this would be an eye-popper. Especially how seamlessly the characters blend with the backgrounds, or how soft the lighting can be. Pablos used to work for Disney during their Renaissance and took it up as his goal to take the art form even further. I'd say he one hundred percent succeeded.As for the story, it's nice. Jesper is a bit of a clich\u00e9 character. A pampered prince forced to work for the first time in his life in a remote village where his heart will finally melt. You've heard this a million times. That being said, the location of Smeerensburg is different enough that it feels kind of new. I also really like the character of Klaus, who's this hulking beast of a lumberjack, who nevertheless speaks rather softly and spends his time making toys. While carrying around an axe big enough to make a Tolkien dwarf proud. Now this is a Santa I can get behind.I like this. It has enough new things to give it a distinct identity, has a nice message, good characters and a gorgeous animation style. What's not to like? I'm definitely checking this out again come next Yuletide.",

I don't know anything about techniques but it has a 2.5D effect. I liked it even though it looks a bit too much like Disney.After about 75 minutes the movie came to it's natural conclusion... But there were still 25 minutes to go. Why? Because for some reason we need to be Hollywood, we need to be Disney. We need to have conflict, over the top action, multiple romances and most importantly, a villain. None of those things have any place in this story and add nothing but we'll cram it in there anyway because that's what Disney does so we're sure that's what the audience wants. We suddenly get a villain with no motivation, we get an action scene that's completely out of place, we get a conflict between the main characters that makes zero sense and we get two romances with for no reason that add nothing (off course the two fattest people in the village fall in love, that's how love works).It diminishes an otherwise nice and good natured movie.

Followed by a happily ever after ending (which ofc makes perfect sense in a Christmas movie.)The characters are all very basic. Especially the antagonists have no depth what so ever.

What is most cool about the film is that he knows how to play with the myths of \"Old Man in Red\", the answers given for the formation of stories around this Christmas story are very interesting, and this is where the script that is written by also director of the film, Sergio Pablos, who conducts an ok beginning story, but which has a very good and fun growth. The characters are not spectacular but they have a good arc. One thing that I really liked was the choice to make an animation by hand, like in older films and that gives a certain nostalgia. Klaus plays on the Christmas myths, and gives a good insight into how the stories came about, it's fun and nostalgic.Film seen on March 8, 2021.",

Rather than just being the story of how kindness overcomes all (which is still a big part of the movie), it reinvents the message in a clever fashion and provides us with a colourful set of characters, all with their complex personal issues, and becomes far more than some children oriented tale that you may expect.The animation, which must also be mentioned, is fantastic and acts as a stylistic blend of 3D and 2D styles - it will be interesting to see what others can make of this in the future.In conclusion, it is an incredibly funny, but also deep and heartwarming movie that should not be missed - totally deserving of its Oscar nomination and high IMDb rating.",

It took me a little while to get used it (since I'm so used to 3D), but once I adjusted, it was great. The characters are also very well done. There's some great character development, Klaus as a character is just so likable. I feel like the film rushed some parts, like Jesper and Klaus' friendship. They went from no communication to consistently exchanging dialogue. I feel like if the film was closer to two hours, then it would've fixed some of these issues. The comedy was also very funny, which completely caught me off guard. I don't really laugh to pg animated movies, but Klaus genuinely made me laugh. I'm between giving Klaus either a 7/10 or a 8/10. I think it's a 7.5; depending on my mood, it'll be an 8. But nonetheless, it's a great movie.",

Klaus is a very kind (although there is violence) and warm film that should gather the whole family around it and make these one and a half hours pass in one breath. Klaus also shows that a very beautiful cartoon does not require animation like Disney or DreamWorks. Summing up, I would like to say a huge thank you to Sergio Pablos and the whole great team for creating such an amazing cartoon that I am sure I will watch more than once, and not necessarily at Christmas.

            "content": "Spoiled rich kid Jesper (Jason Schwartzman) gets sent by his father to Smeerensberg, a remote island far north, a violent and hostile place where two feuding families rule the town, and use a battle bell (tied to a gallows) to start fighting. Eventually, Jesper meets a burly old woodsman named Klaus (JK Simmons), who looks a lot like Jethro from 'The Prince of Egypt', whom Jesper convinces to make toys to give to the town's children so that Jesper can turn a profit as a postman and get back home to his comfortable life. Of course, the two end up saving the town and Jesper starts to care and then the same old liar-revealed-and-redeemed plot happens.\nThe film is beautiful. The colours and the light are masterfully done.\nJesper reminds me somewhat of Gwizdo from 'Dragon Hunters'. Both are anti-heroes who are in it for the money but have hearts of gold buried underneath. However, Jesper is not very well designed. He looks like Dr. Doppler from 'Treasure Planet'. Gwizdo's design is more interesting in that his face is shorter and wider. Sometimes Jesper looks OK but then he starts grimacing and it becomes really unappealing. And while Jesper is a spoiled brat forced into a harsh work environment, Gwizdo grew up poor, is constantly broke and he and his buddy have to look for work where they can find it.\nThe other characters, however, have excellent designs. The leaders of the towns look really cool. There's a cute little girl who can only speak Saami. There's a predictable third act twist and a forced romance that doesn't work. Norm McDonald steals the show as Smeerensberg's savvy ferryman.\nThe film is rated PG and for a good reason. There are some dark and scary moments in the film, and quite a bit of dark comedy (again, there's a hanging joke, but with a bird house instead of a birdcage, or rather a scallop cage). Usually these days 'PG' means \"Practically G\" so this is a surprise.\nUltimately, this is a very poignant film about an unlikely friendship. I recommend it.",

            "content": "Christopher Vogler, the famous Disney story guru, says every good story has a One-Word Theme. What about KLAUS? And how does its OWT connect to the meaning of the Title and Hero's Name--the other two corners of what I call The Symbolic Triangle?The secret of a story's thematic unity.I'll give you my three cents. But first . . .A friend of mine watched KLAUS four times--three times in one day! And she was so eager for me to see the movie too. So I texted her as I watched.And here they are, my texts as I thrilled to the wonder and wit, pratfalls and laughs, setups and payoffs, sights and sounds, and the welling up of emotions delivered by Sergio Pablos's fantabulous KLAUS.\"i love this movie... what a beautiful story beautifully told... the transforming power of the Christmas spirit... the \"Klausmas spirit\"... so clever... Santa Klaus origin story... and hits so close to homeklaus just told jesper about lydia... the big reveal (part 2)... klaus and lydia... build a house... build a future together... a future that never happened... total sadness... but hope and joy restored by the spirit of giving and a selfless heartand jesper's school teacher romantic interest now gonna show jesper why he can't leave, look what he's done to the town... and my own work (purpose), i have jesper-people to thank for helping me rebound like klausat the 45-minute mark, 1/2 way into the 90-minute story, when the reindeer and sleigh join for the first time and thrill jesper and klaus (and us) on their first sleigh ride... so great... and from that point forward, for those who do not know ahead of time where the story is going, we finally get a clue... a clue bigger than north-pole vicinity huge-bodied toy maker with white beard... and we confirm: the story that could be called JESPER is called KLAUS for a reasonwe knew it all along kind of but marvel at how the filmmakers' polaroid snapshot of their story developed slowly and magically and deftly before our very eyes to show us this sleigh ride of a story we find ourselves on... buckle upgreat stretch of about 17 minutes from the sleigh ride at 45 minutes to the end of the \"Invisible\" theme-song scenes... 17 minutes of major turning points and heartmovie magic\"........................Well, those texts to my friend are about as honest as I can be about KLAUS. I've now watched the movie twice. I know why my friend watched it four times. And why we'll both watch it again and again.So much to see and appreciate. The story and screenplay. The animation, artwork, visual creativity and skill. The soundtrack. Amazing.KLAUS is a buddy movie: the selfless woodsman and the selfish postman. The sad toy maker and the spoiled brat. Two men in trouble. And only one knows it (Klaus). Two lost souls on the sleigh ride of life. One from a broken heart, the other from no heart.The Christmas spirit shakes them and wakes them, freeing the angel of their true name and nature: Jesper means \"treasurer.\" \"Bringer of treasure.\" Klaus is a form of Nicholas. Klaus means \"'the people's victory' and implies someone who serves his community and devotes himself to the greater good.\"Together they bring the treasure of joy and goodwill to the unhappy ill-will soaked land of Smeerensburg, changing it from the Isle of Glum into the Island of Fun.Treasure Island.\"A true selfless act always sparks another.\" What Klaus told Jesper at that mid-point of the story, on their first sleigh-ride.\"A true act of goodwill always sparks another.\" What Jesper finally learned too.Both men learned to give. Give, not get (Jesper). Give, not keep (Klaus). Both men no longer would lead lives doomed to sorrow (Klaus) or self-interest (Jesper). Their lives bloom with meaning and purpose (why Jesper's concerned father sent him to Smeerensburg in the first place).In KLAUS, the selfless Christmas spirit that takes hold of Klaus and Jesper rekindles the hearts and reshapes the actions of an entire town. Naughty kids become nice. Then grownups too. Peace and goodwill rescue the townspeople from the curse of generations of the mirth & merriment of fight and spite.Klaus and Jesper's selfless spirit of serving the community for the greater good brings about a people's victory. The treasure of joy and giving. \"Glory to God in the highest, and on earth peace, good will toward men\" and women.And here's another meaning of the name Jesper: a name \"traditionally assigned to one of the wise men (also known as the Magi, or three kings) who were said to have visited the newborn Jesus.\"Jesper the Magi.Jesper, a most unlikely hero--destined to become Jesper the selfless, Jesper the wise--came to Smeerensburg for a reason he didn't know: to visit Klaus. To cause Klaus to feel newborn. Jesper heralded the newborn spirit of Christmas for the joyless town of Smeerensburg by resurrecting Klaus from emotional death, unbearable grief. The dominoes of transformation then fall one by one, each good deed leading to another, transforming the people of Smeerensburg from the inside out.Klaus's prot\u00e9g\u00e9, Jesper--who, figuratively speaking, becomes the \"town treasurer\"--undergoes a change of heart, a reversal of values--and therefore a reversal of fortune. He starts out as a lazy do-nothing rich kid who craves deluxe creature comforts. He ends up with a radically different viewpoint about what really makes somebody rich. Jesper learns, and helps others learn too, how true it is, as Jesus, the central figure of Christmas, said, \"For where your treasure is, there will your heart be also.\"KLAUS reminds us, What treasure could be more priceless than a golden heart? A heart full of love and generosity. A kindhearted and gentlehearted attitude toward other people, toward one's neighbors. A good heart, a heart that treasures selfless acts and giving.A heart like Klaus.\"The best way to find yourself is to lose yourself in the service of others,\" said Mahatma Gandhi. And that's sure what happened to Klaus. Never able to give the toys he made to the children that he dreamed of one day having with his wife, Lydia, who he lost, Klaus lost himself in the service of other people's children instead. And Jesper, the self-serving service worker? The postman who couldn't (or wouldn't) deliver the mail? The spirit of Klaus(mas) rubbed off on him too. Both men were lost. But the Christmas spirit, the spirit of giving, found them. And in turn, they experienced newfound meaning and purpose. Self-worth. And received love in return.Jesper even ended up receiving love from his well-meaning but strict father, who had Jesper's life all planned out. Jesper awakened in his father the treasure of goodwill, defined as \"a kindly feeling of approval and support.\"All thanks to the selfless, redeeming, contagious spirit of Christmas. And the spirit of Lydia pulling the strings behind the scenes to give Klaus a clue. Who else swooped up through that swirl of snow, which happened three times in the movie, swooped up that first letter from the ground and gently carried it into the hands of Klaus? . . . forever changing his heart and therefore his destiny . . . and Jesper's too . . . and also the townspeople's of glorious battle-weary high-jinks Smeerensburg, stand-in for the North Pole.I love ERIN BROKOVICH, RUDY, and ALI--examples of movies where the title character is the main character. But some of my other favorite movies do what KLAUS does: set us up for a journey by the main character who isn't the title character. Movies like HER, MOTHER, COCO, and ANNIE HALL.Storytellers are Magi, bearers of gifts--to us. Magicians. And Magi/Magicians often put their cards on the table face down and wait for us to turn them over, knowing that treasures of insight will be ours if we dare to do so. I'll turn over one more card.KLAUS's screenplay helps me see that writers are Jespers: treasurers of imagination, illumination, and art, bringers of gifts to our soul, mind, and heart. Writers rescue us from self-absorption, confusion, and despair, rousing in us the saving grace of purpose and love. Writers deliver letters written in the ink of Klaus-spirited generosity, empathy, humor, insight, joy, and goodwill. These letters change the world.Just as letters do in KLAUS.___________________________________________The Symbolic Triangle of KLAUS:1. Title: KLAUS2. One-Word Theme: GIVE3. Hero's Name: JESPERI like other choices for the One-Word Theme too: Goodwill, Purpose, Selflessness, Christmas, Love, Service, Heart, Joy. And also . . .Help.Jesper's dad helped his son. Jesper, Santa's helper, helped Klaus. So did Lydia. Klaus helped Jesper. Each action sparked another. Two men and a town in trouble, all calling out for help without knowing it, got the help they needed. Kids helped their families. The teacher helped the kids. Everyone helped one another.Help and Give are two sides of the same coin. I like that both are verbs. Imperatives. I like that Help doubles as a noun and can be a plea, a prayer. I like that Give and Help both ask us to honor the call of the Christmas spirit, the call of the human hero-spirit, the benevolent universal spirit as old as time--and turn our goodwill into action.\"A true act of goodwill always sparks another.\" \"A true selfless act always sparks another.\"Act.Act is a supporting OWT, too vague for the lead OWT. I really like Help (the buried thematic treasure in the story). But I lean toward Give. The iconic message of Christmas.KLAUS lifts our hearts and reminds us that the only practical way to spread Christmas cheer throughout the year is to summon our inner Jesper and Klaus: Treasure others and on their behalf, for the greater good, Act. Help people.Give.Like the hymn says, \"Give of your heart's rich overflow, And peace shall crown your joy-filled day.\"KLAUS sure crowned mine.What a gift.",

It was different than most films made now. It was just going for sort of a looney toons animation. It was cool to see something different. There were some pretty funny scenes that everybody not matter what age would chuckle at. That was something it did well. The story was a different take on how Santa Claus came into being. It was fun to watch that. It was something different than your typical story. The only problem with the story was the start though. It was too confusing for anybody to understand.

            "review_title": "An untold story that's finally been told",
            "content": "The main aspect of this movie that always amazes me whenever I watch it is the animation. The animation in this movie is just so gorgeous to look at and you can tell the animators put so much thought into how they wanted it to look. There aren't that many animated movies that have this kind of look to them and it really reminds me of an old children's book. The animation here is unique in that this movie is a hand-drawn animated movie but through the power of lighting, everything looks and feels 3D. One of the biggest things I noticed in this movie was the lighting and how well it was used. The lighting in every scene helped the audience get a feel for the environment or how a character was feeling at that certain moment. I especially love comparing the lighting for the town of Smeerensburg from the start of the movie to the ending. When we first see the town it's hidden away in a thick fog to where you can't see anything and whatever you do see is dreary to look at. Whereas in the end everything is bright and colourful and it's easy to see everything in the small town. This perfectly shows the change that's happened to this town that once was at each other's throats and now live in harmony with one another. When it comes to the lighting of the characters the best example is Klaus. Klaus is usually seen in darker lighting when we the audience don't fully know him and what exactly his story is but once we learn more about him we see him in brighter lighting.This visually shows the audience how mysterious of a character Klaus is at first but how he's such a kind-hearted character at his core. Honestly, the animation for this movie is so good that if you took the dialogue away the audience would still be able to grasp what's going on and what the moral of the story is. That's how expressive the characters in this movie are and there are actually a few scenes in this movie where there's either no dialogue or little dialogue and you can tell what exactly is going on. I also just wanted to talk about the character designs in this movie. All of the characters have a unique look to them that helps them stand out and you can easily tell them apart from all of the others. When rewatching this movie I especially noticed this with the children in town. It's such a subtle thing that if you're not looking for it you won't notice it but from what I could tell none of the kid's designs looked the same as the others. Something that was a bit harder to tell but once again when you look at the kid's you can tell which family they're from. Even with gorgeous animation, a movie can't be made without a story and the story of this movie is incredible. The story for this movie is one that's never really been talked about or shown in any kind of media. Despite there being lots of Christmas movies about Santa Claus there haven't been many about how exactly this legend began. This movie dared to tell that story and I love how they executed it. The story covers every single thing we know about Santa and shows how exactly it came to be. I especially loved how they covered the aspect of writing a letter to Santa as I feel like that one would be the trickiest one to figure out how it started. But by having this movie follow a postman they solved that tricky problem with grace. But even taking all of that away, the story of this movie is just beautiful. On the surface, this movie is about the origin of Santa Claus but underneath that, it's about how Christmas can bring people together and how it's okay to break traditions. When the movie starts we understand that the Ellingboes and Krums have been at war with each other.We don't know the exact reasons why we just know that this is what the children have been taught as well. But once Klaus and Jesper start to drop off gifts everything in the village starts to change for the better. The whole moral of the story is that one small good deed can set off a chain reaction in others to do the same. The story shows this really well, despite spelling it out for the audience, that you get the proper understanding of what exactly Christmas is meant to be. It's a holiday meant for giving whatever you can, helping out others and spending time with friends and family. It's a beautiful lesson, especially for the kids this movie is targeted towards. But, there's one element to this story that surprised me which is the raw emotion in it. The story for this movie, no matter how cliche it might be, will tug at your heartstrings for all the right reasons. This movie takes you on one wild rollercoaster of emotion but most of the emotion doesn't happen till the second half of the movie. Once the emotional beats hit you though you're already sucked into this movie so it hits even harder. But the story of the movie is so hooking that you don't even notice how much time has passed. The pacing for this movie is honestly great and you don't notice how much time has gone by till you see the credits start rolling. Oddly enough I kind of wish this movie was a bit longer. Even though the movie covers everything given how long the movie is there are still some things that could've been explored a bit more given more run time. Such as Jesper's character development and his relationship with Alva, voiced by Rashida Jones. All of that to me just seemed rushed and I wish it was explored a bit more especially the character growth for Jesper. Without a talented cast of actors to give voices to the characters in this movie then none of this would be possible and the cast for this movie was pretty good. Everybody in this movie was able to convey just through their voice alone the kind of person their character was.The best example of this is Jason Schwartzman as Jesper. He perfectly encapsulated the snobby rich person that is Jesper and how exactly he would feel in certain moments. I loved how he also changed his voice depending on what was needed for the scene and especially as the movie went on. When we first meet him he has that stereotypical rich person voice that he deserves everything and is better than everybody else. Compared to his voice as the movie goes on where he starts to sound more like a natural voice as he starts to realize his situation isn't as bad as he made it out to be. But the real scene stealer for this movie doesn't even talk that much which is J. K. Simmons as Klaus. Klaus is this mysterious woodsman that lives out in the woods by himself and J. K. Simmons voices this character to perfection. He gives Klaus a slightly rougher voice that's still gentle to hear that represents the character well. He was able to switch his voice from this harsher tone to a more gentle one smoothly and that's what really captivates the audience to his performance. I was shocked to hear that this was Sergio Pablos, the director and co-writer, first time directing a movie. This movie was directed so well that he seemed like a professional already. Obviously, being one of the writers of this movie helps him understand what exactly he wanted out of this movie but still. He was able to execute this story so well that as I said earlier this movie sucks you in for this wild ride. The last thing I'll mention is the music in this movie that was composed by Alfonso G. Aguilar. The music in this movie was so well done and brought back those memories of being a kid around Christmas time. All of the music in this movie fits perfectly in whatever scene it's playing in. In the end, Klaus is a unique Christmas movie that deserves checking out. It tells a story that's never been done before and is perfect for the whole family.",

            "content": "\"Klaus\" is beyond a Christmas animation movie. I started watching it as a professional. As an animator i decided to watch it for the new techniques they used for creating it, but soon i forgot to follow what and how they did it. I was immersed in this amazing world that was created on screen. I was again a little girl watching a fairy tale. Everything from the story, trough the character and background designs, music score and the new techniques that were used for creating this animation makes it a masterpiece.\nIn times when the big animation film studios are too busy with corporate stuff and merchandising and broadcasting everything they spit, Sergio Pablos and his studio \"Spa Stuidios\" with the help of Netflix create an actual good animation movie. A movie which is not all about political correctness, but a animation for THE CHILDREN. A pure joy for the viewers, a movie that pretty much resembles the old animation classics. So thank you Sergio Pablos for bringing back the joy of watching animations! Thank you for bringing back the 2D animation to life. And thank you Netflix for believing in this project and make it possible.",

The movie is technically excellent with a great direction, a magnificent photography and a beautiful music. But the best things are the concept design (that is so important for an animated movie) and the animation itself. Indeed almost every fun moment of the movie is of physical comedy but it works so well thanks to the animator that did a great job. The film is very funny and colourful but it has some touching moments too and it has a beautiful message for the kids but most importantly for the adults, in particular for those who grew up with some form of anger or resentment. And for these reasons \"Klaus\" is a very very good animated feature, I think it will become one of my Christmas classics!",

            "content": "This movie was amazing. While most Christmas movies seem to age with time, I feel like this one will be a nice timeless classic (except for the pop rock songs that show up at like two points in the show). It's one I am looking forward to showing my family.I kind of feel in love with pretty much every character that showed up starting with Jesper. Now I will not try to hide this, Jesper is basically Kuzco. He grew up in the lap of luxury, basically got used to doing nothing and having everything handed to him, then gets thrust into a backwater town no one wants to touch in order to teaching him about honesty and hard work. It's a very common plot and I can't tell you the number of times that sort of situation is played out in shows. Most of the time, it just makes me roll my eyes and say 'great, another one of those stories' but just like with Kuzco, it's the comedy they get down right. The timing and expressions are so good that I just was mostly sitting back and chuckling at his misfortunes rather then feeling like it was hitting me over the head with his background. He may be snobbish, but he never acts mean and spiteful to the characters around him even at the start. He just seems more awkward and not sure how to actually act around common folk, especially these kinds of townsfolk where his first impression of them was a all out brawl. Even I would have trouble with how to react to that kind of person.The next person I want to talk about is Klaus, the woodsman. If Jesper is the Kuszco of this movie, then Klaus is... half of Pacha. I say half because he acts like the more quite side of Pacha with the little bit of annoyance Jasper gives him. The other side would have to be Mogens who is this boat captain that has the sarcastic side of Pacha (which is basically the only personality Mogens brings to the table. That's it.). In a comedy, Klaus is the straight man watching from the side lines, seeing Jasper make a fool of himself, and then he comes in and does everything right.Mrs. Krum is the Yzma of the movie and her sidekick Kronk is played well by Mr. Ellingboe. Two characters who are heads of different clans that fight each other. Can you tell they probably took a LOT of ideas from The Emperors New Groove?While they had the feeling of The Emperors New Groove in the slap stick and the personality of the characters, the story itself has some key points that make it its own story. The message it tries to put across for example is not a story of being humble but of doing good. One thing that kept on coming up over and over again is 'A true selfless act always sparks another' which is a very good thought... in theory. I sometimes wonder if that may be a bit of a translation problem seeing as this was created as a Spanish film but needless to say, it felt like the message should have been altered. It partly hammers into your head the reason Jesper is making these changes is to make his mail quota and the reason why the kids do what they do is for the presents (that is not a spoiler seeing this is the origin of Santa Claus) so calling it a true selfless act feels wrong. Maybe an act of kindness can spark another, but selfless means you want nothing behind it. Just a little nit picking.The animation was amazing, giving 2D a 3D feeling. It feels like a moving picture book with how the colors and lighting fall perfectly onto the characters. They used a mixture of different mediums to make it look new and exciting which blends almost seamlessly together. Almost each and every character looks completely different from one another which means no two characters have the same silhouette. It adds a lot of fun especially when you have large scenes with tons of characters in them. I watched a movie insider video on Youtube about the show and they talked about the fact that there were 3,160 scenic layouts set up for the lighting to make sure each one both matched the lighting of the character and the mood of what would be happening in that spot. As an artist myself, it blows my mind that they did so many different pieces as each scene was a bunch of different layers placed together. Sorry, I'm geeking out very slightly.The voice acting is amazing, the pop music... I'm not so sure. Like it fits a little bit, but not sure if it couldn't of been something else placed there. The instrumental and background music was quite magical and the only vocal song that stood out as a perfect fit was 'Invisible' by Zara Larsson. Somehow that just felt like it had a better feel then the strange rap song popping up randomly. Jason Schwartzman bought a lot of energy playing Jesper and kept it up throughout the movie. He really nailed the scenes in which he had a chip on his shoulder but could also play the rather calmer sweet version when needed. J.K. Simmons was amazing as Klaus and some how made this tall masculine character have a really sweet gentle side to him. Surprising for the person who played J. Jonah Jameson from Sam Raimi's Spider-Man films.Overall, I feel like this is a must watch for anyone who has a bit of Christmas spirit in them or likes Santa Claus. Heck, even if you don't celebrate Christmas, I feel like this movie would be very good to add to your video watching as Christmas is just one very small piece to the whole story. I know I really want to add this movie to one of my 'watch every year' additions.",

A movie I wanted to watch as soon as it came out but never got around to, and what a just amazing looking and wonderful movie.I loved Kalus, it\u00b4s just a joyous time and you\u00b4ll smile throughout it. It\u00b4s both fun and incredible to look at. It\u00b4s so nice to see 2D animation being highlighted again and this movie looks incredible. Sadly, it falls a bit short towards the end, becoming a bit too cliche, but up until then, it\u00b4s fun and so well done.We follow Jesper, a mailman that is sent to an island where two clans are fighting each other. He needs to deliver 6000 letters in a year in order to o back home to his luxurious life. No one is mailing anything though, until kids start to send letters to mister Klaus, who then brings them toys.The animation is amazing in this movie. There are a few detailless backgrounds, but in general every background looks incredibly detailed and beautiful. It\u00b4s so nice to see 2D animation have relevance in modern times. Often, I think 3D animation can becomes stiff and lifeless in modern times and it\u00b4s so nice to see someone really care. The movements of characters are fluid, and the expressions are so well done. The shading looks incredible, and the lighting is astonishing. There is so much emphasis on shadows, soft and strong light that the movie just pops. It\u00b4s also such a greatly character animated movie, it\u00b4s those small extra frames that adds so much life to the movie. It\u00b4s a masterpiece in animation.It\u00b4s so fun to see how they handled this origin story and I think it works wonders for the movie. To see how legends are formed from nearly nothing is so interesting and it\u00b4s so fun to see a reference come a mile away. You pick up on what the movie wants to do very quickly, even though you have to get through a beginning that will make you question if this is a Christmas movie. It\u00b4s also a great way to do a Christmas movie that isn't just the same old \"Christmas is in danger\". The movie has a really fun run and to see a war-torn city becomes whole is wholesome. It\u00b4s also fun to see characters change for the better and really make them smell the flowers which is kinda the moral of the story, together with not being selfish.The characters are all really well done and fun. Klaus is a great character with a good arc, if not a bot too over explained and Jesper has a great arc too. It\u00b4s a simple story with simple characters, but if it works, it works.The movies humor really landed with me. It\u00b4s those small extra frames that adds to the humor or after a conversation a small things happen. I vibed with the humor a lot and I think it\u00b4s a really fun movie. The movie becomes more serious though and the humor kinda takes a backseat.The movies feels so original but sadly falls into some really cliche territory towards the ends and it kind of makes the movie less enjoyable. I also think it was weird that Christmas is named dropped where it was, like what was Christmas before this movie? I also did not predict how they would handle the ending and it fells a bit unsatisfying in a way.The score is kind of just here in this movie. It sounds highly unoriginal and done many times before but it\u00b4s better than having pop songs that don't fit the movies at all. It\u00b4s not all the time, but all of a sudden there is a pop song in this movie, and it really doesn't fit the movie. It stands out as a clash to the animation so much it\u00b4s kind of memorable, but in a \"that was cringe\" way.Klaus is a movie doing so many things right. The animation, humor and story premise and execution is so good and I loved the movie in so many ways. Sadly it loses some of its magi towards the end but heck, watch this. It\u00b4s fun, it\u00b4s charming and in my opinion, a new Christmas classic.",

Jason Schwartsman is Jesper, the main man (well main Postman) and though he sometimes sounds like Ryan Reynolds, he manages to take the character from dislikeable layabout to hero in a smooth transition.With the message, that a simple acts of kindness sparks another, this is a lovely little Christmas film, with a good heart, some nice humour and a film that the whole family will enjoy watching together. A brings a smile to your face 14/20.",

That is all I will say about this movie because I want you to experience it with as few spoilers as possible. This movie, while not hilarious, is very funny and has some recurring jokes that are hard to notice, but when you do they are funny, and you feel proud for noticing them even if they are somewhat easy to spot. This movie is very consistently good, and I could see why this had such great reviews from the start but it started getting better around an hour in, and by then I agreed with all the reviews. I have a few complaints, like how a couple of parts in the 3rd act don't make sense but the rest of the 3rd act makes up for that. The 3rd act is almost always my favorite part of any movie but for this movie, I would give that award to the 2nd act. This is a great Christmas movie, sadly I watched it on the 27th. 8.2/10.",

But most importantly it's hand drawn... by actual human hands... the way the nine old men would have done it! You get that personal touch that you only get when someone is actually producing artwork and not just connecting vector dots on a computer screen. It's a special kind of warm fuzzy magic that just isn't common place in American animated films anymore. Of course this film isn't American, Sergio Pablos took what he learned working on films like Hercules and The Hunchback of Notre Dame and created his own studio in Spain to create this masterpiece. This film is a Christmas classic, a great Santa origin story, but it's much more than that, it's a true marvel of modern artistry seemlesly blending the old with the new to create something incredible.",

            "content": "Klaus brings something to the table that very few modern Christmas tales seem to have these days: a soul. It's mostly a well-grounded story that for most of the film takes on the persona of an origin story for the Santa Claus mythology, and it is humble enough that it does this quite effectively.Klaus is a woodsman living a life akin to a hermit and a bit cranky when first encountered by our protagonist. That's right, thankfully this tales isn't told from the perspective of Klaus himself, but from the character Jesper who is a spoiled son of a post master sent out to the ends of the earth on assignment as punishment for being spoiled, lazy, and altogether uninterested with anything other than loafing about and enjoying his privileged life. This is a fitter place to center the plot, because his story arc is a basic tale of redemption. This works well with Klaus's story arc, which is one of rejuvenation. Jesper is discovering his true self, while Klaus is rediscovering his.See, Klaus is a toy maker... or something. He's got a load of old toys. Only later on does his backstory get revealed-one which is somber and moving. He had built his house in the woods for he and his wife and began making toys while waiting expectantly for the flock of children that they would bring into the world... a dream that went unrealized as years went by without a single child ever materializing. This is a brilliant anchor point for this character, as the unfulfilled dreams of children of his own due to infertility is a relatable and motivating origin for the character to want to bring joy to children wherever they may be. But it's not even the sad part... Ms. Klaus dies of illness, you see, which is both refreshingly accurate for the time period (death from disease would have been common place back then and having such a grim reality of life feature into a story like this is a brave and welcome move. It all feels much more true to life than most stories in this genre would even attempt to be.Now, as for Jesper, he starts off as selfishly motivated as you'd expect. He is driven by his need to delivery enough letters to complete his assignment and return home to his father's good graces again. He comes across Klaus and his stash of toys and begins by using him to get children to write letters to Klaus in exchange for one of the toys. Predictably, this slowly changes as he begins to take genuine pleasure in the joy to children of the town and the town itself, which is rundown and torn apart by an age-old clan feud, begins to change as the community is healed by a virtuous cycle propagated via the reciprocation of acts of good will. Soon, all the children of the town are writing Klaus for toys and a familiar mythology is building up around old Klaus and his legend: only good children will get toys, he comes down the chimney, he uses magic to deliver the toys, and the reindeer and sleigh eventually show up. Even the element of elves has a root in some local natives showing up to help rebuild and expand the toy workshop.It's all quaint, heart-warming, and has a lot of good comedy thrown in all around. And it stays that way. It's cartoonish and light-hearted at times, but always stays grounded in realism for the central storyline. It's entirely secular, and the only thing even close to \"Christmas magic\" that we are shown is a peculiar winter wind that is suggestive as the spirit of Klaus's deceased wife guiding him to find his purpose in this world. I really love that approach.Where the ball gets dropped a bit is the ending: where that down-to-earth spirit of a secular, humanistic Christmas-time myth gets abandoned in favor of... a direct tie in to a real-life magical Santa in our modern times. Post climax, as the story is wrapping up and we're following our characters expanding their operation over the years and continuing the tradition of holiday gift deliveries, Klaus eventually encounters that winter wind again, only this time he knows it's calling to him. There's a tender moment where he says knowingly to the spirit of his wife that \"he's on his way\" and walks off into the woods and disappears. I was on the edge of my seat at this point because this would have been a BOLD way to wrap up the story. I thought they might really allude to Klaus finally passing away, and that somehow the myth and tradition would go on. This would have left us with an ending much more in keeping with the rest of the film, and a much more powerful message: that a single life lived well and generously for the sake of others would continue living on and have an impact much bigger than itself. It would have worked really well and made it a complete anomaly. They didn't even have to tackle the elephant in the room head on, directly saying anything about Santa not really existing (it's a kid film after all), but they could have easily left it gloriously ambiguous. Instead, they decided to go in the other direction and provide what no-doubt the masses wanted: a Santa origin story and not a Santa mythology origin story.We end with a narrative about how no one ever found Klaus and we see Jesper now has a family of his own and he's hanging stockings on Christmas eve and putting out cookies and milk, and sitting in a chair waiting up all night and explaining that whatever happened he has no idea how or why and can't explain any of it... but that \"one night every year, he still gets to see his friend\". Well, now. That let a good deal of the air out of the tires for me. It by no means ruins the experience, but it's the same kind of literal territory that countless other films have already done again and again. No, it wouldn't have been enough to have had Jesper go sadly to the town to tell the children why there'd be no presents this year and find that somehow they all still got presents anyway and maybe the parents look off in to the sky conspicuously trying to pretend they don't know how, and then have Jesper conclude that Klaus was \"somehow still with us and always would be because good deeds always inspire more good deeds\" or something like that... I doubt they wanted to walk into that particular cultural minefield, and so they avoided controversy by leaving very little to anyone's imagination, leaving us with the impression that Klaus merely ascended to heaven like a prophet to become a magical superhero who we now all know and love. It probably does work better as a straight children's tale this way, but it could have retained more humanity if it just took its premise a bit further and focused on the good deeds of a man who lived his life so generously as to inspire a myth spanning the generations and growing into a symbol of something powerful, rather than on transforming the man literally into a supernatural character that the film is obligated to treat as real. So, whereas we have a story awash in beautiful humanism, we leave off rather unsatisfactorily with a return to capitalism and fantasy.The other thing I didn't love was the anachronisms. The film never dates the time period exactly, but there are lots of jokes, dialogue, references, etc that felt really out of place and the general feel of the characters and the town itself didn't feel appropriate for the setting. I think this is one of those things where the filmmakers feel they need to have a certain feel or vibe in order to relate to their target audience (which I almost certainly and admittedly am not within their target audience...) by playing to their sensibilities. For me, the same kind of tone of Long Way North might have worked even better here and helped Klaus really soar, without any need for magic sleighs.",

Or if it had focused on the unique dynamics of the town or the postal service and the ideosyncracies of the different characters, sticking to being its own story instead of turning into an action film about \"this is how the clich\u00e9 Santa came to be\" and forcing th MC to go through the old so-this-is-the-meaning-of-christmas thing.",

With hope to get it over and done with quickly, Jesper discovers there's a divide amongst the village where fights a regularly taken place.When Jesper meets Klaus, he is pushed into delivery a small toy to a child and see something that isn't common around the village... laughter and smiles. Seeing the happiness in the small child, Jesper tells the children of the village that they must write a letter to Klaus to receive a toy in return.I'm sure you can start to see what path the film goes down..Klaus was so enjoyable to watch. It takes a different approach to Christmas films compared to a lot of them. It was refreshing and remained interesting from start to finish.I feel like this can easily become a classic that is rewatched every year, it was an incredible story",

In all honesty, this films is almost devoid of any considerable or obvious flaws, which is why it deserves a spot as one of the best Christmas movies I've ever watched.10/10",

The story is great but at times a little cliched. I would say the film is a little predictable, but the execution is great. Also, I found the soundtrack choices a bit weird. It just felt off with a pop song in the middle of an emotional scene. But those are minor nit-picks. Overall a great Christmas film for all ages (over the age of 7).",

It is the first animated film from Netflix to be nominated for an Academy Award as \"Best Animated Feature Film\".The plot revolves around Jesper, a lazy son who was forcefully sent by his father to a distant island named Smeerensburg to post 6,000 letters within a year. If he somehow fails to complete the task, he would be completely cut off from his family.The local people of the island are always busy fighting with each other. They never felt the importance and emotion behind writing letters. Meanwhile, Jesper meets a woodsman named Klaus. And the storyline becomes more engaging after that.If you are looking for a Christmas movie to watch this weekend, then you should go for \"Klaus\". This movie is about friendship, kindness, hope, and obviously Santa Claus. The visuals are amazing and eye-soothing.To my opinion, \" Klaus\" is a highly recommendable Christmas movie.",

The fake-3D is certainly excellent, but during the presentation it left me perplexed, all those tricks of shadows and shades gave me the feeling of superfluous weight to the vision, honestly I was eager for a classic 2D. Fortunately, the film later disproved my concerns.The story is not complicated, after all we do not expect it given the Christmas theme, however the triggering reason of the story and the spoiled protagonist, were not even too trivial. Usually, these films tend to use an heir for the bearded giver of gifts, regardless of gender, disposition or any family relationship. Here, on the other hand, he is a mere, unexpected, assistant and at the same time the puppeteer, moved by absolutely personal reasons. I think it's one of those few cartoons in which I really felt the gradual redemption of the protagonist. Mr. Pablos as director certainly deserves to be kept an eye on for his possible future projects.100% positive opinion, it is clearly seen that it is not a real Netflix product, but for once ... it must be acknowledged that it was useful in promoting something really decent. Could it have been the magic of Christmas?",

First of all, it's a great Christmas movie, with messages about the importance of kindness and good will. The \"Changes\" scene, in particular, where you see the town transform, is flawless, how one little thing can change everything. Second of all, it's hilarious. Jason as Jesper is great, Norm as the boatman is great, and even the clans are funny. Third of all, it's such a heartwarming story. The character arcs of Klaus and Jesper, as well as the way they intertwine with each other, are perfect.

Jason Schwartzman had the spoilt brat in his voice, which became so lovable in equal measure. J.K. Simmons as Klaus never fails to deliver, and Rashida Jones imbued the right amount of sass but care for Alva. The character arc for Jesper was nailed and no character was sold short.The effects had the stunning mysticism of those amazing Japanese anime, whilst having the detail and over-the-topness of something like Ratatouille. Even the sounds were so detailed (scenes with birdhouses are so natural).It also took the Christmas spirit motif and made it fresh and original. I will leave out how they do this because it is better to it play out for yourself.It was predictable, and the foreign, eskimo type characters felt like they were put in at the last minute because they were forgotten, but frankly I don't care because it was so endearing and an amazing twist on a Xmas film.",

In fact, all of Jasper's interactions were well developed and quite charming to witness as they helped him understand the main moral of the plot: the best things in life comes from the simplest things with friends and family. Much like Kuzco, Jesper turned from an arrogant, egotistical individual, to a lovable and kind-hearted person who is willing to devote his time to make children happy in an otherwise miserable place. Some other characters like Alva was also quite the interesting individual. Add the impeccable performances, like Oscar-winning J.K.

Until a late-night, he meets the scary Mr. Klaus. Klaus tells Jesper he needs a present delivered instantly. And through the movie, all the traditional myths about Santa are created.I really liked the story. It felt new and interesting. Then about half the movie through the cliche started. But it's still one of the better family films about Christmas in my opinion. At first, I thought that the animation was a bit clumsy but I grew on me. The spiky animation and the unrealistic angles went from clumsy to lovely.The music used suited the scenes very well. You could hear the beautiful soundtrack and carefully thought out. But one song I just didn't feel served the movie right. The pop song by Zara Larsson ruins the spirit of the movie.

            "content": "So here I am, watching Klaus, a Christmas film, on Netflix, in mid-January. Pretty normal for someone like me, but for most, it's likely a criminal offence.The animation is breathtaking. Enough said.No, but in all seriousness, this is a modern Christmas classic. Yes, there are some weird song choices used that stick out like a sore thumb. Yes, the third act doesn't land too much. And yes, this is a Netflix film, which may annoy some. But this truly warms my heart, even when my heart is at it's coldest.The film's incredible hand-drawn/2D animation is a breath of fresh air for an industry overshadowed by 3D animation, with occasional stop-motion attempts here and there. Not only this, the animation allows the characters to have phenomenal designs as well. When looking at the cast, the only real standout is JK Simmons, but in the film, everyone is giving it their all. From the aforementioned Simmons to Jason Schwartzman as Jesper, hell even the smaller roles have actors/actresses doing a great job. And the characters are so fun to watch. Jesper and Klaus make for a unique and brilliant dynamic, and their chemistry is never-ending. The story itself is interesting enough to keep me engaged, so that gets a solid pass.It's hard to believe that the director of this, Sergio Pablos, was one of the co-creators of the Despicable Me franchise of films/merchandise. But that shouldn't be an issue in the slightest. You may find yourself drawn in due to the phenomenal animation, and yes that is true, but stay for the ride and you'll find more than just the animation to keep you entertaining for nearly 100 minutes.Oh and I did I mention the animation is brilliant?",

At first, I thought it is just an ordinary animated film about Santa, but as I watched the early footage, I realized it is not purely centered on the legendary Santa, but it is centered on a human being who is exactly like one of us,--don't deny it guys, sometime in our lives we feel irresponsible, lazy and just simply enjoying our life slacking and making our parents feel so stressed and irritated about our ways. And this film is about a son of a wealthy postmaster general who after trying to reform his lazy, spoiled son with several attempts, finally decides to send him to a cold, unlovable town on an island called Smeerensburg as a postman, to let him learn a lesson to straighten his irresponsibleness, and that all of the townsfolk and kids slowly mend their ways, inspired by an old toymaker who happens to be our dear old Santa Klaus.I just don't want to be a spoiler but I promise you and your adorable fam, will have a great time watching this all together.As quoted from Sergio Pablos, himself who is the amazing writer-director, together with Jim Mahoney and Zach Lewis, of this 2D animated action, adventure-packed, comedy-drama movie, and Netflix's first original animated feature, \"But then I actually came around to the idea that maybe the perfect way to watch a film like 'Klaus' is to sit at home with your family, wrapped in a blanket with a cup of hot cocoa.\"So, there you are folks, you are in for a sumptuous holiday treat all year round, as I feel I can watch this again and again. Hats off to you Director Pablos and congratulations on winning the 73rd (BAFTA) British Academy of Film and Television Arts Award for Best Animated Feature, Academy Nominee for Best Animated Feature, and more other seven awards in the 47th Annie Awards.",

Let me, also, explain to you.On one hand this beautiful story, comes to break the magic about Santa Clause; as a child that believed in his existence until.. well 13?15? (Can't remember) in the beginning I really did not appreciate destroying this bits of happiness and magic he brings with his existence.However this film comes and creates sense in all these things you've been sure all these years that were just part of a beautiful fairytale for kids. It brings logic and reality in each little thing, explaining everything you know about him...And by the moment you're so sure that's all, by the moment you think it's the end, then happens the unexpected and it gives you back the magic, the faith, the hope.So in the end they made Claus even more real, no matter if you want to believe in him or not!\nPS. The movie, technically could have some slight changes which would make it even more complete and not predictable on some points, but overall, it deserves for suuure your time and attention!!",

Especially during the introduction of Smeerensburg and its dwellers, when I felt like this could take the dark comedy/thriller route very easily. Something like \"Coraline\", while great, was definitely not what we wanted to watch at the moment.But that fear was quickly abated as the mood progressively gets lighter while the story unfolds. I loved the fact that this is nicely captured in the way the animation shifts from the initial dark and icy setting to a warm and fuzzy atmosphere by the end.I also loved the fact that it reminded me a bit of the Brothers Grimm stories I read as a child by not being afraid to hint at more mature/dark elements that drive the story without spoiling the fun by being to dark or explicit. Also, the main characters feel flawed, not in a disney-esque \"let's give the character a big nose or a funny accent\" kind of way but in a more human way. They felt like real, imperfect people as opposed to some 2d idealistic representations.Not sure if this will become a x-mass classic but we will definitely watch it again.",

            "content": "\"A true selfless act always sparks another.\"If your kid has ever asked you where did Santa Claus come from or why is he the way he is, then this is the movie you ought to watch together. More than a month before Christmas last year (2019), Netflix released a Christmas movie that pulled everyone's hearts out. This movie was titled Klaus. Based on the myth of the Santa Claus (or is it a myth, really?), Sergio Pablo's Klaus is about how a friendship between an old man and a good-for-nothing postman results into the legend that is now renowned as of the Santa Claus.Think of it like an origin story of the entire legend of Santa Claus. All of the myths regarding Santa Claus, say of the Naughty List or the one of where he watches everything or every other that you can think of, for that matter. It's not like Klaus has magical reindeer with him or that he fits into the chimney, but when you see the movie, you realize how the creators have explained all of that.When Jesper, a student at the Royal Postal Academy, distinguishes himself as the worst student of the academy, he is stationed to set a postal office in Smeerensburg, a frozen island far into the North, with the ultimatum to get 6000 letters stamped by him else he would lose all of his inheritance. The thing about Smeerensburg that everyone fails to mention to him, however, is that it is the place of one of the longest and oldest feuds in the history of feuds-between the Krums and the Ellingboes. All they ever do is destroy the other person so there isn't much need for a letter. How then, will Jesper station his office? This is where Klaus comes in.A movie popularly recognized to stand amongst the often-watched Christmas classics, Klaus also merits to be one of the best Netflix films for children and adults, alike. People from every which age can watch it and fall in love with it. The best part, however, about the movie is that it is beautiful to watch. Once you sit down, you don't even want to get up to bring popcorn!It is no unknown fact that the movie has some very violent scenes, what with it being based on one of the oldest feuds known to man. Yet, not only do those scenes end quickly, but they are also portrayed in such a comical manner that it wouldn't be much of an issue to show to the kids.What I also liked about the film was its central message: how an unselfish deed can go a long way. It isn't about giving and sharing, or how they are better. All it says is that if you do one thing for the goodwill of the people then other good things will follow. (Hint: Jesper's happiness at seeing Margu with the boat.) Some other things the movie talks about include the importance of education and of a proper community in the lives of the people. It also shows us why age-old grudges that hold no substance except their identity as a grudge better stay buried. That is why the transformation of the place was a huge thing, especially since it was based on simple steps that the kids took.What adds more tangibility to the movie is Klaus's backstory. You find out a lot more about Klaus and why he does the things he do, adding more depth to the character. Not to mention how Klaus is huge but there aren't many fat jokes. Of course, it is mentioned and you also laugh at the way it is mentioned but you also deal with it. It's there; you can't do much about it.Among the characters, I found Mrs. Krum to be the most spectacular character. She is evil but in her own way, she is also pretty funny. When you mix evil and comedy together, the outcome isn't always that great. Mrs. Krum proves to be one of those exceptions that actually do make it great. Mrs. Krum's son and Mr. Ellingboe's daughter are also pretty amazing. You'll have to watch the movie to find out why, but let me just say this here that these four people (Mrs. Krum, her son, Mr. Ellingboe, his daughter) probably make one of the best antagonist groups in the history of antagonist groups! Not only is their characterization amazing but their animation, too!Of course, Jesper was another favourite. Yes, he is a cliche (not that the entire movie isn't filled with it) but his transformation from one of the most self-centered people to the guy who spends his time making a boat, is worth-mentioning. Klaus was another great character. I enjoyed his story. I fell in love with him. Their relationship together is something that shows what true friendship really is.Miss Alva, a person desperate to leave Smeerensburg but who then ends up staying there for good-yeah, another character who I absolutely adored. Margu, the little Saami girl's importance in the movie doesn't go unnoticed. Had it not been for her, we might never have had a Mr. Claus. I also love how the movie consulted Saamis in its making.",

The movie is like a little stream where you can bath your soul, bringing you the fresh and comfort. I don't like unhappy endings, like the character I like dies, but here with Klaus, I accepted him fading away, it didnot soak me in the sadness but a softer and easier feelings. I love everything, EVERYTHING about this movie, like when Jesper and his father made a very small eye-contact when they were in the boating preparing to come home, very moved!!!, you can see a great father who is enormously sympathetic towards his son, the eye was saying \"now, my boy, I am listening\". The color, character build, every little details are well-made and fantastic. Bravo!!!",

It's so simple yet effective, showing what kindness can do. My only problem with the story is the liar revealed trope. I have no problem with the other tropes Klaus has, but that one was truly lame and every movie should stop using it or do something a bit more creative than have a characters be annoyed for few minutes. Luckily It doesn't last long and the movie can end on a great noteI truly believe that almost everyone can enjoy this. My favorite movies so far in 2019 have been pretty depressing so It's really refreshing to see a movie this wholesomeFinal score light 9 to strong 8",

There are many layers to the story which include addressing some political issues too. Rather than portraying certain ideas just for the sake of telling it Klaus shows the solution on how to make it happen. The animation is nostalgic, colorful, and fresh. Klaus brings up the fact that we don't need to do something big to make a change.\nWatch it for a splendid animated movie experience.",

Frankly, I don't get how can anyone above the age of 6 can enjoy 'Klaus', and not at all crown it as the other reviews here do.I might end up too Scrooged, but I only criticise it because we've seen before that such things can be done properly, and yet people are getting thrilled by sheer mediocrity.\nAnd Netflix will be Netflix...\nSurprise.",

Boyyy, am I glad I watched it. The main character, Jesper, is at first an uninteresting, selfish, trust find type of guy whose development was a joy to watch. Taken out of his element and desperate to get back into it, he helped completely renovate a miserable town and flip it into a hopeful, heartwarming place. I never thought I'd see a Santa story with such a major face lift! Definitely adding this to my yearly movie watchlist, rolled up in a blanket, candles lit with some hot chocolate (heavy on the marshmallows)!Overall an absolutely exuberant and well thought out film, great for people of all ages. 10 stars!",

            "content": "I have never seen such a boring movie. When I heard about Klaus, I immediately wanted to watch with interest, because everyone praised him insanely. We talked about the perfect execution technique, how each frame was drawn with soul, the nostalgia of the old Disney animation. And about the original plot .. That's what bribed me. Because a cartoon that will be perfect from all sides is now difficult to find, because Disney has flooded the entire production market. But .. as it turned out, Klaus is even more banal and clich\u00e9d than Disney.I am very disappointed and wonder why only positive reviews. Maybe they don't want to spoil the Christmas story?But you have to start over. The execution technique is really worth attention, everything is drawn very well, each frame is filled with details. But you won't get enough of a good picture.Plot. How difficult it is to describe. After all, it started so well, a good plot about how a negligent son is thrown to the mercy of fate on an island to howling clans. Since I was well tuned by the reviews, I tried to close my eyes to the strange beaten holes in the plot. But then everything was spoiled by such a terrible pop sugary song that after that it was impossible to take everything seriously.From that moment the main problems of the film began. Sweetness is not the main thing. The main thing is a clich\u00e9, and again a clich\u00e9. And also holes. 1. Heroes save themselves and save their product at the very last moment, when there were no prerequisites for this. Just because the writers decided to save the fairy tale and finished drawing the trump card. Simply because the heroes suddenly had a piano in the bushes (although there was no word about it until now) 2. Evil villains behave this way because they are evil. 3. The good old man has had problems all this time, which for some reason he does not want to reveal, because according to the clich\u00e9 he should have a secret. 4. Characters are transformed as soon as the main character lifts a finger - it was unbelievable either in the 50s or now. 5. How children wrote letters when they didn't even have a school. 6. What does the film teach if the teacher spends her savings, and the old man spends his property on production - free of charge. Yes, this is a children's film, but you can't ignore common sense. 7. What did the postman eat and how did he warm himself for half a year if he didn't have a cent and the house consisted entirely of holes. 8. But even if physics and economics are neglected here for the sake of children's satisfaction, how to explain the stupid insults of adults in the film to the postman.I don't understand why there are so many good reviews. All this Christmas atmosphere is worthless against the background of the perfect flatness of the characters, as if five-year-old children wrote the second half of the plot.3 out of 10Only for technique, graphics and animation.",

Excellent writing as well as screenplay.\nBecause of the lighting I was convinced it was pure 3d-animation, which would make saying I was impressed the understatement of the year (given that we are at the end of it, that should say something). I read that it was 2d animation but cgi lighting later, and didn't care. This is the best 2d animation since Disney stopped doing what they were best at. In fact I strongly suspect some former Disney animators here since Disney no longer employs any to my knowledge. This is what 2d animation can do, which 3d, while able to do tons in its own right, has yet to accomplish: caricature. This is what Disney should still be doing instead of re-making their best work in 3d.

No Disney movies have ever made me want to do that. The movies that ever came close to good or decent are the toy story movies, and / or perhaps Up. It's not just the plot, the animation, character design, style, music, it's the execution of all of them combined.I rarely give a review on any movies because I work in the film industry, there is always something I don't like about a movie, plot holes, acting issues, creative designs, just always something. However, I am not a particularly picky movie viewer. I tried not to criticise most movies, simply because I know how much time and effort the crew puts into making one. It's no easy task, but there will always be something that fell flat.I write reviews not based on how much I like / dislike the movies, rather what I learned from them and how much I appreciate them.What I learned from Klaus as a movie maker:\nwe don't need crazy CGI, A-list actors/actresses, 3D animations to make a great movie.we don't need catchy song along songs, those we hear so often until we are absolutely sick of themwe don't need the same stories nor movies to be remake five thousand different times, that's lazy, and of course, fast cashwe don't need superheroes, nor super villainwe don't need a complicated story, rather a creative oneHow can we re-write a story of a holiday tradition that is so influential in our life time? Klaus is not only creative, it's original! Klaus didn't tell us anything new about human nature, but the story puts children front and centre. It reminds us that children don't discriminate, if they do, it is the result of parenting and the pressure of our society. It shows us how simple acts of kindness could (potentially) change our world. The screenplay is timeless and very well written. There are no catchy songs, nor sing along, only music scores that move our emotions along with the movie. The classic 2D hand drawn style brought us back to the times when sending and receiving letters was one of the few things we actually look forward to.I didn't learn anything new from Klaus. It did however, reminded me of what gives us joy. It could be as simple as a random act of kindness, writing a letter to an old friend, or spend valuable time with my love ones, in a small town, without silk sheets, a butler, and all the material stuff that we don't need.",

It's not childish and full of stupid jokes. It's heartwarming and beautiful.\nWe finally have a christmasmovie that's worth watching every year.",

So I watched it and instantly fell in love.As an adult with no children, all the Rankin and Bass animations, the Grinch Who Stole Christmas (Chuck Jones version), and The Nightmare Before Christmas, make up my Christmas season. This will definitely fit in.I tend to lean heavy towards the darker side of humor and this has it. The towns people seem a tribute to Tim Burton, the overblown violence a tribute to Chuck Jones, the squabbling banter as funny as Heat Miser and his brother Snow. And of course, as with all Christmastime stories, it has a lot of heart too. The voices are perfectly cast. The animation is quite beautiful.I do think that it's a little adult, for some kids. Not meaning PG-13 rating or anything, I just mean the pacing is a bit slower in parts to build up atmosphere and suspense. Not the kind of in your face action all the time like some cartoons. But then again, I don't have kids, so take or leave this opinion as you will.",

            "content": "Jesper is a spoiled son of the Post Master General, he only cares about himself and living a comfortable life. His father to teach him a lesson in humility and the value of hard work sends him to the town of Smeerensburg. In this town abides two rival families that have been in conflict since before anyone can remember. they don't know why, they just know that they don't like each other. Jesper has been given the task that if he can deliver a certain amount of letters he will be able to return home. The problem is that because everyone disdains one another, no one will ever send a letter. All of that changes when though a series of events Jesper helps a woodsman named Klaus give a toy to a little boy. Jesper uses this opportunity to manipulate the children into sending letters to Klaus so that he will send them a toy. Through this experience Jesper learns that \"An act of good will inevitably sparks another\". A great message but unfortunately not executed perfectly. You see because Jesper tells the children that if they aren't good that they won't get any toys, the kids begin doing good deeds around town and the town starts because a better and more friendly place to live. The elders of both families don't like this and plot to get rid of Jesper and spot Klaus from giving any more toy. They conclude that if they stop the toys from coming people will cease doing acts of good will. While the film has a happy ending it never really disproves this theory. As Jesper says \"Everyone is out to get something\" he even uses the kids being good for toys as an example. While Jesper does become less selfish by the end of the film this objection is never really answered. Even Klaus and Jesper it could be argued have something to get out of the good tht they do, though it may be subjective. So is there anyone who has done an act of good will by pure motive. there is only one, Jesus Christ. Who left the glory of heaven, humbled himself to become a man and walk among us. Dies on the cross bearing our sins and being punished under the wrath of God that we as sinners deserve. On the 3rd day He rose again and he has done this to redeem a people who don't deserve it. He is the good will to men. Klaus is a wonderful film with great animation that I plan to watch every year as a Christmas tradition but it points me back to the true good will that came to men 2,000 years ago. Also made my wife cry, a delightful film.",

Didn't even shed a tear at the supposed emotional ending.Takes a long bleepin' time to get going, and by the time it does, you know what's going to happen and how it's going to end. Predictable. Non emotion evoking. Lack of real character dvevelopment, especially for the amount of time they took to tell the story and failed.Sat down with the kids to watch, the positive is that the kid that didn't want to watch ended up enjoying it. Other one said \"that was really long\"... Yea. Long and boring, kid. I agree.Ultimately, a swing and a miss, for me.",

Younger kids might find a few scenes too scary and it might ruin the magic of Santa for them.The detail of the world created was amazing. Loved how the city in which the characters were living in wasn't just some city - it was an artwork with plenty cool details. The care and effort put into the details made the whole animation look very realistic yet dreamy.The soundtrack suited the movie well. It didn't take the focus of what was happening, but complemented every scene like a good soundtrack does.The story was simple yet effective. Made my eyes tear up a few good times with both sad and happy emotions.All in all, the movie had everything a great Christmas movie should.Amaze-jingle-bellz! Should have won an Oscar!",

            "content": "Klaus (2019) is a beautifully animated and heartwarming film that tells the origin story of Santa Claus. It follows Jesper, a failed postal academy student, as he is assigned to a remote island above the Arctic Circle to deliver mail. There, he meets Klaus, a reclusive toymaker, and Alva, a no-nonsense teacher, and together they bring joy and holiday cheer to the previously despondent town.The film's animation is truly breathtaking, with detailed and charming character designs and stunning snowy landscapes. The use of different animation styles, including stop-motion and 2D animation, adds to the film's visual appeal. The voice cast, including Jason Schwartzman as Jesper and J. K. Simmons as Klaus, is also strong, bringing depth and emotion to their characters.The film's themes of kindness and the power of community are truly uplifting and heartwarming. Klaus is portrayed as a humble and selfless figure who brings joy to others, and the film's message about the importance of coming together as a community and helping one another is timely and relevant. The film's portrayal of the transformative power of kindness and the ripple effect it can have on those around us is particularly poignant.While the plot of Klaus may be somewhat predictable, it is still a delightful and enjoyable film. The climactic scene, in which Jesper and Klaus confront the town's tyrannical mayor, is exciting and well-done, providing a satisfying resolution to the story.Personally, Klaus left a warm and fuzzy feeling in my heart. Its message of kindness and the power of community is something that we could all benefit from hearing, especially during these trying times. It serves as a reminder of the good that can be found in the world, and the impact that one person can have on those around them. Klaus is a film that I will surely be revisiting in the future, and I have no doubt that it will continue to bring joy and cheer to viewers for years to come.Overall, I would give Klaus an 8 out of 10. While its plot may be somewhat predictable, the film more than makes up for it with its gorgeous animation, heartwarming themes, and strong voice cast. It is a delightful and uplifting holiday film that is sure to delight viewers of all ages. Whether you're a fan of holiday films or simply in need of some cheer, Klaus is sure to bring a smile to your face and a warm feeling to your heart.",

This is a truly inventive, good-hearted Christmas film.The film uses old-fashioned animation with digital techniques to bring a 2 1/2D look to it. This looks AMAZING. I don't think I've seen something quite like this. The painted appearance to the backgrounds and characters looks great. The designs of the characters and locales are all distinctive, especially the characters. There is a wide cast here and they are so stylistically designed. The movie takes place around this town where two clans are at war. The townspeople are such a wonderfully diverse group of grotesques. I also loved the look of Klaus (voiced by J.K. Simmons) who is given a large, broad-shouldered figure. The character movement is also really fluid.The story is equally good. Although the film ultimately goes the way you predict it will, the storytelling in this is so well done that it doesn't much matter. The idea of the story of Santa Claus being told through non-magical reasons and happening through the actions of a postman is definitely something different from most attempts at Santa origin stories. The warring clans part brings a nice dab of dark humor while the sentimental bits are done nicely. All the characters are likable.I highly recommend you check this out. This is just a really well-done family Christmas movie.",

What makes this film work so well is not that it's some silly story about Santa Claus, but the very real impact people can make in our day-to-day lives. How greatness can come from nothing, even ill-intended goodwill is still goodwill, and the results are spectacular. It is this expose of generosity that gives Klaus a real meaning and value beyond the obvious. It's a beautiful story with a core of solid gold that cannot be broken by critics who seem far more comfortable giving high praise to revenge stories, perhaps because they see a bit more of themselves in characters so absorbed in hatred. I am truly shocked a film of this stature only received a 65 on Metacritic, and for some strange reason the rather uninspired Toy Story 4 snagged the Oscar over this masterclass of storytelling. A good story should be what means the most to the audience. And on that front, Klaus excelled in spades. We see a town embroiled in hatred. We see the destitute. We see the excuses. We see good people turned bad. And throughout the movie, a whole lot of bad people turned good. A true act of goodwill always sparks another. That is the foundation of the entire story, and the strength and wisdom of that gives this entire film a transcendent foundation that cannot falter. It's a message we need more of these days, and one that has never been shown more beautifully. A rare 10/10 from me.",

And in this movie I really do see where the critics are coming from. This movie has very few surprises in the way it builds its narrative. Even casual movie watchers will recognize each and every part that makes up this movie and there are definitely parts of this movie that are worth criticizing. Some of the jokes fall a bit flat. Some of the line deliveries could have used a second take, etc. However, this is where the critics fail. Often through no fault of their own, apart from being jaded from experience, they too often break down a movie instead of taking it as a whole and that does this movie a massive disservice.This movie has an incredible amount of heart that is present throughout and you can tell that the creators really put their all into presenting it. The animation, atmosphere and storytelling, even if it isn't anything really new, is amazingly adept at making the audience feel. Throwing us between joy and sadness sometimes even in the very same scene.And for a Christmas movie it really nails it. I could see myself watching this every year with my family as it's just that good at setting the Christmas mood.This is, without a doubt, a future Christmas classic.",

If I could describe it, well, do you remember the Disney short Paperman? You know, the one where they shaded CGI animation to make it look hand-drawn? Well, Klaus is the opposite. It\u2019s hand-drawn animation that is shaded to look like CGI. I\u2019ve never seen this style before and it looks great! It\u2019s so colourful and well-designed. The voice acting and the writing is really damn good too! Honestly, there are only a couple issues I have. Some of the music choices and what little CGI this movie does use seem out-of-place, but other than that this might be the best Christmas movie since Arthur Christmas.

I am confident in saying that this could become a Christmas classic although I had some issues that are common in ChristmasMost of this year\u2019s Netflix releases have been bland and boring but I\u2019m glad to say that Klaus is the exact opposite. I am confident in saying that this could become a Christmas classic although I had some issues that are common in Christmas related films. The story is a little simplistic. I know that it\u2019s more for children but I wish that these stories had a little more depth and more ideas presented. Even though the story is simplistic, it is still engaging. I was never bored throughout the course of the film and I was always interested in the characters and what they were doing. For a Christmas film, the characters are pretty good. The villains are kind of boring but the rest of the characters have their own interesting arc that they go through. This is boosted by some great voice acting from Jason Schwartzman, Rashida Jones, and J.K. Simmons who plays Klaus in the movie. Simmons gives the best performance in the film by far. Jason Schwartzman does a pretty good job although he was given a Christmas cliche that did annoy me. It\u2019s the standard cliche of a character has different motives that change before the end and has a misunderstanding with the other characters who ignore him. That happens in this film and it was a little obnoxious. Some of the music choices were pretty weird too. They decided to create an original song for the film and it didn\u2019t fit it that well in my opinion. The animation is beautiful in Klaus. It\u2019s all hand drawn animation and it reminded me of classic Disney films. The design of the town was pretty great and interesting with all these different characters doing different things. There were some jokes thrown into the film and some of them weren\u2019t that funny but the funniest ones were the jokes you can see in the background. All of these little visual cues were hilarious in my opinion. There is a lot of heart to this film. I was surprised at how much joy I felt when watching this and the ending was fantastic. It\u2019s sad and joyful at the same time. This is a film I will probably start watching every Christmas. It\u2019s a satisfying origin story to Santa Claus. Overall, Klaus may be a little too simplistic with weird music choices but its heart, animation, and voice acting make this an instant Christmas classic.",

I'm so happy to see movies that push boundaries and try to offer something different visually speaking, and this is one of those. There isn't a single moment in the movie that looks bad. It's stunningly beautiful, highly energetic and with so much style. It is like watching moving illustrations. In the other aspects, this movie is still really good. The concept is actually pretty unique. It's basically a Santa Claus \"origin story\" and a really creative one with so much originality...For the most part. See, the story for two-thirds of the movie was flawless: The pacing was great, the writing was great, everything felt great. It was until the end of the second act and the third act when I started to really disagree with some writing choices in both story and dialogue. The movie felt sort of anticlimatic in the end. I'm pretty sure that if the writers worked in some more ideas for the second half of the movie, it would've been pretty much a flawless screenplay. There were some emotional moments that really worked, but could've worked so much better if the music choice was better. Speaking about that, there were some music choices that felt out of place. Unlike a movie like Spider-Man Into the Spider-Verse which I also critized some music choices, at least the \"bad music\" made sense because it was established that rap/hip hop music was associated with the main character: Here, there were some songs that felt out of place because they don't fit the setting and the time period at all, which is definetely not the present day. The humor was, in my opinion, pretty \"hit or miss\", but when it hit, it was really good. The characters are full of personality and charisma. I really love the character design overall. It looks so stylistic and energetic and watching those designs in motion...Jesus Christ! So gorgeous. I'm so happy this movie exists. Despite some issues I pointed out, this is a great movie and one of the best animated movies I've seen during the year. Definetely give it a watch, especially if you're an artist or an animation student or you are just interested in animation, because this is an example of how making something look different from other movies can give it so much personality and uniqueness.",

As per usual, IMDB and Rotten Tomatoes hit the nail on the head with their reviews for the movie giving it an overall score of 8.5/10 and 90%. As for Metacritic\u2026 well as per every movie that seems amazingly done they will try and find something be it so insignificantly small or just wrong, in order to slander the movie and therefore make their \u201copinions\u201d \u201cunique\u201d. Metacritic is like that one kid that you don\u2019t want to invite to anything because you know that the kid will just ruin it for you completely, they are the pessimists that no one likes and that always have wrong opinions. Metacritic gave this an overall 63%. Now I understand that there are people in Metacritic who give actual reviews but the majority is so awfully wrong that you would have to question if they just let their 3-year-old baby\u2019s write the reviews or they are being forced at gunpoint to write such horrible reviews to keep their lives. Although this is a review of Klaus the movie I have to take time to address the horrible scrutiny that most of the time is complete poop, to be frank. Metacritic as a whole is just for people with \u201cunique\u201d opinions to feel like they belong somewhere, unique as in completely wrong, pessimistic, horrible just horrible opinions. Now don\u2019t get me wrong they have given fair scores to movies such as The Dark Knight with an 84% or Marvel\u2019s Avengers: Endgame with a 78% (I am being sarcastic and believe these movies should be given much higher praise) some may believe that this is because Metacritic has very high standards but that is far from the truth, taking good movies and games and saying they are bad because they don\u2019t meet the impossible standards they set in their own minds is plain stupid. Most people who like Metacritic don\u2019t even pay attention to their own reviews because they know its all botched. Rotten Tomatoes and IMDB are not the best either but of the three rotten tomatoes and IMBD seem to have the best grip on what the audience thought and what the critics thought to give the best overall scores (if you look at how many critics actually use Metacritic its so low that people just shouldn\u2019t even bother paying attention to Metacritic when they search a movie up on google). In conclusion, Metacritic\u2019s reviews are like watching someone cut their finger off with a rusty fork, its just wrong and it doesn\u2019t work well at all, or its like watching a kid kick you in the crotch and then you tell them \u201cdon\u2019t do it again\u201d and they just do it again because all they heard was \u201cdo it again\u201d they don\u2019t listen to anyone and keep doing the wrong thing.Why Klaus Is Amazing\tEven before one word of dialogue has been said you can already tell that you are in for a treat, the animation and artwork for this movie is absolutely gorgeous and it helps the visual storytelling by a lot. Before knowing what\u2019s going on the art shows us we are in a timeless land and that this is a remodeling of the old Christmas story of Santa. The actual plot is amazing, it takes many cliches but makes it work in a way where they actually work as good storytelling devices. Every single detail and point made in the story equal to amazing results and quality. The new take on Mr. Klaus was wonderfully done and with the addition of the art design it helped all the audience to feel like a kid again, everything that was once magical IS magical still. I dont believe I have ever seen a movie that told the story of Christmas in a new way and actually worked as an amazing piece of art. The length that this story goes with its new Santa is done magnificently, making him a regular human (or so we thought) not only made us connect with him more but also made us smile like kids to know that this man is Santa. The main character of the story Jesper Johanna is a regular post office man who helps create the Santa story, making him come up with the naughty list and the giving children toys on Christmas thing was such a wonderful surprise. Because we love this character we don\u2019t mind him changing the story, although it did bother me at first that Santa wasn\u2019t just a magical being, the ending made me really wonder \u201cwas he really not magical? Or did I just not notice\u201d the way they humanize him is truly incredible.  The wind as a symbolic reference to Santa\u2019s past lover is a cliche but works so well in the story that it doesn\u2019t take anything away and just adds even more. The wind being symbolic for Santa\u2019s wife and the wind moving through the snow, (which is connected to Santa because it represents Christmas which he holds dear to his heart) just creates even more amazing symbolism. The ending was amazing and really was an unexpected tear-jerker.",

A well-executed movie can be a transformative experience and leave a positive, lasting impression. For me, the most recent movie I\u2019ve seen that had that effect on me was Klaus. It\u2019s a great story about selfishness turned selflessness, hatred turned love, and the true power of giving.\u201cA true selfless act always sparks another.\u201dIf you haven\u2019t watched it I won\u2019t ruin it for you, but I will say that I aspire to have an impact on our community like Jesper has on Smeerensburg. It won\u2019t happen overnight nor by just my own hands, but rather with the help of those around me it will happen over time. I\u2019m looking forward to the journey as that story unfolds. Thanks, Sergio, for this movie. It\u2019s now on our annual rotation of Christmas movies to watch with the family.",
