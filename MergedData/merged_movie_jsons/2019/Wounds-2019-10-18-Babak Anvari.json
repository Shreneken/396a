When people look at the phone they see pictures of things the kids did and it sparks an interest or attachment in the viewer to this released entity. It comes from a tunnel. It tweaks an interest and suggests something about oneself as per the quote from Heart of Darkness. He's a shell of a man filling the void with drinking. The cockroaches are the amount of entity present. Hence at the end they're everywhere and the thing comes out of the wound portal to enter him and fill his void.",

To drop the phone and send messages with ZERO context?When you do realize that the ritual was performed based on some books, you are never told what happened and why it happened.This movie is garbage.",

            "content": "I couldn't spoil the plot, even if i wanted to. Because i don't know what the movie is about.The beginning was kinda good.A bar, only a few frequent guests, a bar fight and a guy (maybe a friend of the protagonist or just a regular guest idk) is getting stabbed in the face. They find the \"evil\" phone (as the movie trailer hinted). I thought the evilness of the phone caused the fight and the spooky spooky first \"Wound\"But then it turned into some relationship drama with roaches. He is in a relationship, his ex-girlfriend too. He wants her back, she doesn't want him back. He casually breaks up with his girlfriend sitting at the table having breakfast. The morning after she gazed into a hole thingy on her laptop looking like a corpse and peed on a chair. A couple of roaches later he eats/inhales/absorbs the moldy facial wound from the guy who got stabbed. The end.I still don't know what's with the evil phone or the hole thingy and the roaches. I only know why the movie is called \"Wounds\" because it's so stupid you will get brain damage. The acting is sometimes good, dialogues are bad, and it's not scary. Maybe for people who don't like roaches. It's not body horror, it's not mind-bending, there is no ghost/demon/supernatural entity, no reality - dream confusion.\nWho reads that and says \"Let's make a movie\" Obviously it wasn't someone who watched a horror movie before.The only scary thing was, that he sat on the pee chair then he sat on the couch, the next morning he wears the same pee-pants, he breaks up with his girlfriend and wanders off to the bar still in pee-pants.After reading the short story, everything became so clear. \ud83e\udd23 Apparently he is such a depraved person he drinks, cheats, gets angry and works as a bartender. That he needs and eventually wants to be saved by the cockroach-angels which use decapitated and then peeled heads or wounds in general as a portal and can communicate via cell phone.I am not a fan of the story either, the descriptions are too much sometimes borderline pretentious. blood-spattered like a psychedelic Vulcano caught in mid-explosion, a berserker canary in a sky full of hawks, stabbed guy makes a high pitched noise that seemed to signal a transition into another state of being that seemed to carve this moment from the rational world and torn it separate. All this and Will booted up his video game console not an Xbox or PS. And the roaches are a swarm of christ bound spirits.",

He lives a normal life with his girlfriend Carrie (Dakota Johnson) and things starts to change after he witnesses a huge fight in his bar. It's first 30 minutes is very promising but once we start going to the second act it starts to fall apart and the film relies more on \"holy s**t\" movements rather than a convincing plot.The film ends ambiguously and doesn't really give us an idea about Babak wanted to explore.

            "content": "\"Wounds\" turned out to be the kind of horror that's right up my isle, unsettling, moody, even gnarly & with occult themes involved. Despite its one major flaw which got everyone throwing around the well below average ratings, I'm here to defend it.\"Wounds\" can be best described as a mood piece, it's a slow burning drama for the most part and the aforementioned flaw is that there are no fireworks at the end of it - We'll return to that later. I was already satisfied with the movie in the first 10 minutes, many qualities like great acting, good dialogue, effective atmosphere & pleasant cinematography manifested themselves and stayed till the end. I'm not going to spoil the story, I think it's for the best you know no more than what the synopsis and trailer shows you. To describe it a little, the story is quite narrow, mostly revolves around Armie Hammers character and his, I'd like to say, descended into madness. I have a huge love for occult themes in horror movies & rarely anything like that comes along, the last I remember was a horror indie \"Pyewacket\". \"Wounds\" strong suit is definitely the legitimately creepy atmosphere, supported by solid performances, top tier sound design & well done fx, some of it practical. Visually I can't pick on it at all. I enjoyed the fact that a lot of the creepiness factor was in the clashes between characters, just in the conversations, tension and the impending doom can be felt, if you let it. Then comes the ending which, yes, felt underwhelming, but I can't disregard the whole movie because of it & that's why I didn't give it more than a 7. I would've. A lot of movies that I can call mood pieces - a lot of them have little to no substance, they sacrifice plot for the sake of atmosphere building. Personally, atmosphere is one the most important parts in movies for me & sure, if it also has substance, even better.\"Wounds\" is a flawed movie with an objectively highly underwhelming and cut-off ending, but before that there are 90 minutes filled with dark atmosphere, dread and quality filmmaking in almost all its aspects. I enjoyed it a lot. My rating: 7/10.",

            "content": "I am a big fan of Babak's previous film 'Under the Shadow', which was a perfect summation of what a great supernatural film can be, with investment in the characters, overall story arc and satisfying, yet open-ended ending. So, when attending Sundance Film Festival 2019 and saw his next film 'Wounds' on the list, naturally I jumped at the chance to see it.This movie had the right mix of tension built up between the characters from the very first scene and delivered an astoundingly eerie and ominous presence throughout the film as weird events transpired. Armie Hammer's performance and reaction to everything occurring to him throughout the sequence of strange events in the film was absolutely phenomenal and really captivated my attention. However, where this film fell flat was in the story arc and ending. By the ending, you realize that nothing was explained throughout the film and you can't help but have a ton of questions only to be left without any answers. What did the original owners of the phone do that caused the chaos that spiraled out of control in the entire film? Was Armie Hammer's character possessed? If so, by what and how? What was the image that his girlfriend was compelled to stare at for hours on end on her computer screen? This left me as the viewer feeling short changed and upset at what could have been a phenomenal film.I know that this film was based on a book called The Visible Filth that I have not yet read, but hopefully there might be answers to some of these questions in there that the movie did not provide.Overall, this film had massive potential that was utterly wasted with an unsatisfying and in-conclusive ending. I am hoping this is just part 1 with a 2nd movie to be released that can provide some guidance into the confusion that I just watched.",

            "content": "Alternate title: \"The Man Who Refused To Step On Cockroaches\".I don't know if there is a person on this planet (except for the handful of freaks to hold these awful insects as pets) who'd never step on a cockroach, even if he were surrounded and plagued by them day-in day-out. But this unexpected cockroach-tolerance - displayed by the protagonist - is the least of the movie's problems.The first half-hour is fairly intriguing. Not much wasted screen-time on small-talk i.e. the usual boring introductory nonsense you get in 95% of horror films when little happens and characters utter mundane, meaningless (and unfunny) lines to each other. An unusual set-up too; it is unclear where the movie is heading with all this, and that's usually a good thing. (Turns out it was heading nowhere.)Unfortunately, things start getting a little bit stupid after that. Firstly, the bartender (who looks vaguely like Greg Kinnear) doesn't go to the cops. Considering that he has good friends who are cops and who work nearby, this is fairly illogical. (Even his girlfriend later admonishes him for being reluctant about informing cops.) Nor is he in a rush to inform the phone's owner - one of his own customers - that the phone is in his possession. Then we have that silly, exaggerated scene in which he throws himself out of his car - and within seconds ten people are standing around him, filming him with mobile phones! Is this a comedy then? It wasn't until then.Later that day the barkeep goes back to work, more-or-less as if not much had happened. The fact that he saw photos of severed heads? That he was told by anonymous people he \"was chosen\" for sacrifice? The fact that after this warning he had a vivid hallucination that made him throw out the phone and almost smash into a car - while thinking he was being attacked by cockroaches? He is way too chill. (His girl tells him later on that he is \"too blas\u00e9\" about all this, but we never find out why hence her comment is irrelevant.) Any person would have been freaking out, for days, if not weeks, months. But that's the problem with so many movies; they are not focused on keeping things even half-way realistic. This is doubly stupid, because this movie plays out as a half-drama, not as some generic formulaic teen horror - in which such idiotic characterization errors/inconsistencies are not only common but expected.The barkeep is shown to be cunning (for example the way he figures out the password on the mysterious phone), and yet when the cops ask him for the license plate number of the car that's been following him, he stupidly responds with: \"it begins with six\", and without a trace of joking. The cops laugh, while the audience does a collective face-palm. So is he dumb or not? Well, he snorts cocaine, so it's probably the former.Nevertheless, despite these minor irritations, by the time I reached the one-hour mark I was still wondering why the movie has such a low rating for a non-B-movie production. A 4.0 is fairly low for a horror film with a decent budget. (Especially since budget movies get automatically swarm-voted and fake-reviewed, more so than low-budget stinkers.) There was no obvious badness there. Not yet. This would change.In the second hour, the movie still had plenty of mystery on its side, things were still interesting. And fairly dumb too. Despite witnessing so many weird things the night he dropped his girlfriend into the bathtub, things that would utterly freak out ANYBODY, he still had the motivation to call up his ex to find out why she told her new boyfriend about their little stint together. That'd be like being in a burning airplane, falling down rapidly while everyone around you was screaming - then deciding to phone up your girlfriend to ask her who won the Cup finale. Quite absurd. Relationship issues should be the last thing on anyone's mind while hell-demons from other dimensions are threatening to crush all of their teeth and lop off their head. It's called \"emergency prioritizing\". (Or at least that's how I decided to name it.)Even sillier, the next morning instead of discussing Satan's hell-beasts and how to defend themselves from them, he calmly proposes to his girlfriend that they break up! I.e. yet more relationship nonsense, which is extremely irrelevant given their situation. It's as if this movie is desperately trying to play a romantic drama CONCURRENTLY with a hell-beast demon possession horror. Not doable. And why make that kind of movie anyway? That same day he pesters his ex, yet again, wanting to discuss relationship stuff. Did these demons possess him to become a yenta or to use his (empty) head as a vessel to enter the human realm in a weird cockroach-infested ritual? Which is it? It can't be both. Nora Roberts never had a supernatural satanic sub-plot. (Just guessing here, obviously.)It's a pity that the film is so seriously hampered by these relationship scenes and the overall genre schizophrenia. I'd have cut them out, turn this into a proper horror film.But wait, no. I'd still have an incomplete movie, because of those idiotic, confusing last few scenes which not only explain ZERO about what's been going on but muddle things even more. The utterly nonsensical dialog between the bartender and the Confederate thug is a scene that redefines \"worthless\".This is Wikipedia's explanation: \"Will (barkeep) realizes the higher being the kids summoned is inside Eric's wound. After calling Garrett again, which fills the room with the inhuman screeching, a swarm of cockroaches arrive. Will finally submits and starts to absorb the higher being in an attempt to become whole as cockroaches envelop the house.\" This summary is rubbish, and even if it weren't this \"explanation\" resolves nothing. Becoming whole? We knew he was an A-whole, but we never knew he was supposed to be whole, whatever that means.What's with that Confederate flag crap, anyway? When will American movies finally stop insulting us with their cheap, filthy propaganda nonsense? The more they tell me to hate the Confederate flag the more I am liable to sympathize with its fans; they are just achieving the opposite with this kind of preaching, at least in my case.Two points off for the silly ending that serves no purpose, except to tell us that the writer/director isn't competent enough to deliver a script without outside help. The movie is based on a novel; that book is either rubbish or has been butchered by a lame adaptation. Why do these millennial/Xer directors have to write as well as direct? This is just one of many reasons why (American) cinema has deteriorated so rapidly this century, this megalomania and exaggerated self-belief among so many writers and directors that they can do everything themselves. Becoming a respected \"auteur\" these days is a big hipster ambition, but only very few are capable of pulling it off with success. And I mean QUALITY success, not financial success.",

Like a good (or bad) trip the story doesn't gives us any explanations what's going on and after the final curtain is closed the audience is left with a lot of questions and not many answers.

I've seen it all from highly anticipated big budget films to the cheapest looking indie films you can find with a special interest in found footage. To me, the scariest type of film is the type that leaves much to the viewers imagination and is somewhat open to interpretation. Nothing is scarier than what we can cook up in our minds. Other movies in a similar vein are \"The Blair Witch Project\", \"V/H/S 1 AND 2\" and even \"Southbound\" all these films have incredibly dark tones and seriously creepy nuances. This brings me to \"Wounds\"; one of the most mysterious and darkly atmospheric horror films to come around in some time. Armie Hammer plays Will, a bartender working in a scruff type area and who lives with his younger girlfriend. He is a handsome man but he is also a very needy and possessive man as he begs for the affection of a close friend of his that will never see him as anything more than just a friend, if that. The film revolves around a plot involving a violent incident that takes place in the bar during the opening scene and a cell phone that is left behind that night by a group of mysterious underage teenagers. Will takes the phone home that night and so begins one of the most deeply unnerving horror films ever made with a potent break up story running through out. Anvari uses his minimalistic approach here again to create something truly sinister oozing with dread. This movie is unpredictable and as a whole it will leave u scratching ur head. Maybe checking for roaches or maybe just in confusion. The confusion gives way to creative implements on what we just witnessed.",

The production alone should put this movie at a 5/10 and another few points for the acting, which is top notch. Where it missed was not having an acceptable ending which i find is happening more and more. Especially when it's hard to bring the story together they just stop the movie. I don't want to choose my own ending and try and figure out what happened. They had the piece ther for it to be great and they hinted at there being a reason for this by the small snippets of computer scenes.

The acting is strong and so is Anvari's skilled steady hand for framing scenes and visceral imagery. It probably belongs more in the terror and surreal categories than standard horror.\nMy main gripe is probably Armie Hammer's natural charm and the script not really emphasising Will's supposed staleness and hollowness, you often kinda feel yourself rooting for a rather average and flawed guy and his descent feels a bit like the generic sudden descent into madness trope and not like Will's lack of drive and standards being the vessel for the rotten fruit he will harvest.On a side note, it's also fun to imagine this movie as sort of a side sequel portraying the aftermath of one of the countless \"college kids mess with forces they don't understand\" movies.",

Yes, it sounds stupid but the level of craft shown means the results are anything but. Unsettling events slowly build up an atmosphere of oppressive dread. Zazie Beetz gives a good performance as well. As with many good horror movies, things don't turn out too well for everyone involved. I think it's been a stellar couple of years recently for horror films, with a new wave of superb horror movies such as \"Suspiria\", \"Hereditary\", \"Midsommar\" making the rounds; while \"wounds\" is definitely not in the same class, it still deserves a watch by horror aficionados.

After the fight is finished and the customers leave the bar, Will finds a mobile phone on the floor which he assumes belongs to one of the customers. Will takes the phone home with him and he suddenly begins to receive messages directed at him on the phone. From this follows many disturbing and mysterious things in Will life which he tries to understand. Will and his girlfriend Carrie (Dakota Johnson) begin to investigate.Needless to say this is a horror film and I was generally curious to see this film considering the leading actors.But No. It's bad. Like, really bad \ud83d\ude02Trying to explain the entire film to someone is damn near impossible. The only bit that is easily explained is the start of this film (I'm not kidding). The reason for this is that the film is poorly done, particularly in regards to its story, the characters and even the way it's shot.Many horror elements that occur to Will and Carrie are simply not explained nor does it make sense for audiences members who watch it. At times the film feels incomplete or half done. I also felt the same way about a 2016 film entitled \"The Disappointments Room\".Our characters are dull, uninteresting and consistently make unwise choices. Will is a leading man who is completely unlikeable. As a bartender he does a terrible job, tries to cheat on his girlfriend and when dealing with a so called \"evil presence\" makes personally unwise choices which only hurt my head trying to think what is actually going on in this film. If you watch this film and understand every element, I will salute you.The film's style is also dark and the filming is generally shaky. Some shots will have objects in frames as if the director is trying to be creative, but again it comes off messy and sloppy.Overall, Wound is an awful horror film. Considering the film's cast, I was left feeling shocked at the end results. This is a horror film which has a plot that makes no sense, feels incomplete and characters who are truly silly at every point. Movie lovers will feel a \"Wound\" in their hearts trying to understand anything and everything. Awful and disgusting.1.0/10\nWalkden Entertainment",

The pacing is not great in the first half and it seems to just keep lingering on the not particularly interesting personal life of the not particularly likable main character and you start wondering if this is going to be one of those Open House type movies where it just endlessly hints at a climax that never arrives or another generic haunting/curse movie that's just 80 minutes of filler and 10 minutes of CG jump scares.Eventually it does turn a corner into something much more interesting though. More pieces start falling into place and the almost painfully vague shape of the mysterious threat finally starts to become more clear, though you do have to pay very close attention to see all those pieces as some of them fly by so subtly or so quickly that you can easily miss them. The ending in particular ties it all together in a pretty powerful way that's going to have you thinking about it for a while.Ultimately, to me, Wounds isn't really even a story about supernatural evil. It's a story about being hopelessly lost, hitting rock bottom, and looking to desperately fill that void with anything no matter how harmful it might be to yourself and others. In Will's case it was a supernatural entity that chose to take advantage of his emptiness, but he could have just as easily fallen into drugs, a cult, crime, a hate group, etc. I know because I used to be just like him. I was lucky enough to meet someone that snapped me out of it and helped me turn my life around, but I often think about how much further I could have fallen if things had been different, and it's a pretty scary thought, so you can see why this story could really hit home with me, and I can understand why someone who hasn't been through this (or is still in denial that they're currently going through it) wouldn't feel the same impact.While I feel that Wounds stumbles a few times along the way, in the end it really had something to say. Something that you may find yourself turning around like a little puzzle box in your mind for some time after it concludes, and that's the mark of a story that's more effective than not to me. 8/10.",

If you're used to Annabells and stale hollywood remakes that's fine. But we need directors who are willing to try something different such as Ari Aster or Ben Wheatley.How many of you can remember even one scene from uninspired horrors like The Conjuring 3 or Curse of la Llorona or tiresome remakes of Evil Dead or Pet Sematary?But sure as hell we'll remember and reflect on films that DO NOT follow your standard horror formula - like \"Primer\", \"Mandy\", \"The Witch\" or \"Kill List\" because they are different, intriguing and demand patience from the viewer.

Mood swings. And obsession with his friend.The direction is boring. The characters make stupid decision. Such as right when the character brings home another persons phone.

In fact, they were so spectacularly negative, that I felt the need to witness some of this trainwreck for myself, fully expecting another dreadful Netflix Original.\nBut half an hour in, I was already loving it.Now this is my kind of horror. No boring old zombies, no possessed dolls, ghosts or creepy children, no knife-wielding serial killers that appear and disappear like ninjas in the shadows. All of which are overdone tiresome tropes that do nothing for me.\nBut eerie offbeat macabre concepts are exactly the type of things I'm on board with.\nOther dimensions? demonic portals? The more sinister parts of the occult? Otherworldly hallucinations that lead to madness? Yes please.Halfway through the movie I felt I had to Google some stuff, where I discovered the story is based on a novella by Nathan Ballingrud; a story I've had on my To-Read-List for a while. So no wonder I was so into this. I then promptly ordered the author's short-story collection which includes Wounds, but otherwise titled The Visible Filth.Now, apart from some notably ambiguous actions and events, I love the constant permeating thrum when Will (Armie Hammer) is either in his home or that of his friend Eric. It's a constant sense of dread and unease. It reminded me of some of the weirder and more ominous scenes in a David Lynch production, except this was dialled up to 11 and remained that way for a good chunk of its overall duration.I kinda love that Armie Hammer chose this role. He plays the type of guy who looks like he never leaves the house, despite having a full-time bar job. I mean, the guy is practically an Adonis of a man, but still managed to play the 'loser' guy pretty well.\nDakota on the other hand, looked even sexier than usual and with hardly even doing much. Although the way she violently stomps on a cockroach whilst casually sitting at the breakfast table, so blas\u00e9, the rest of her body at rest... wow; if that was my woman, I would lunge in for a fervent passionate kiss right then.I guess it's not a crowd-pleasing movie, though I'm not alone. I did find, upon searching, many other 4 and 5 star reviews praising it.\nSo for a select few (myself included) this is a nice little gem, and we're happy to revel in the darkness of its obscurity.The only negative I can think of is that some of the writing/dialogue is a bit choppy - but forgivable.\nAlso, it left me wanting more. But I guess that was the point. The final shot was definitely a keeper.",

The streams of sorrow and regret, taking control of thoughts and actions. An unfortunate circumstance that is experienced by the most enraptured of couples. So I'm somewhat confused. No wait, I'm terribly befuddled. Anvari previously directed an apparent debut horror masterpiece with 'Under the Shadow' (I've yet to see it...), and decided to venture into the Hollywood mainstream with this psychological mess. Only one question overwhelmed my brain during the final cockroach-infested scene: \"What. In the actual. Heck?\".A bartender breaks up a brawl and picks up a lost mobile phone that was left by some underaged students. He happens to guess the password on his second attempt based on the screen smudges and slowly becomes possessed by something from the \"tunnel\".The titular metaphor is one that requires little to no effort in depicting. Wounds in a relationship force the participants to become distant and more aggressive. That much is clear, and Anvari sets a melodramatic tone from the initial bar sequence that overpowers the \"horror\" elements. Then Hammer grabs the mobile phone, tests its durability by slamming it a decent six times throughout the film, and thus begins the narrative collapse.Irrefutably, without batting an eyelid, I can confidently say nothing happened in this feature. Absolutely zero progression. The final minute of filming replicated the initial minute in terms of development. Every single character was unlikeable. Every single jump scare was a bloodshot eye flashing on the screen in rapid succession accompanied by a piercing noise. The plot is near incomprehensible due to forced underdeveloped horror elements that had no resonation with the melodramatic moments. Gnostic rituals? Dimensional portal from a well-rounded man's face? Profusely sweaty armpits? Thematically and literarily, the plot is nullified by unintelligent tendencies that irritate this wounded flick.Such a stellar cast wasted on a potboiler script. Hammer deserves better. Beetz deserves better. Johnson definitely deserves better. I'm at a loss. I really am. The inexplicable character choices, from refusing to hand the phone to the police to even unlocking the device in the first place, left me facepalming on multiple occasions. Oh, and serving underaged persons. Come on! The plot conveniences that make little to no sense, from the unexplained students in this cultish circle to the entire final five minute idiocy, hampered the psychological examination of a broken relationship. Is anything actually explained? I shan't know as I drifted in and out of sleep for the conclusive thirty minutes. The amount of alcohol consumption? Adultery? Stealing?There really is nothing to admire here. A huge misfire for Anvari that has cemented this VOD original securely as one of the worst of the year. It was over an hour and a half yet it felt like three hours. That, in itself, has wounded me. The recovery will be long and arduous...",

Since you can find both its definition and a long list of examples listed in Wikipedia I won't burden you with that background information here.I haven't had benefit of any formal education qualifying me as a film critic so I can't claim technical certainty, but WOUNDS is clearly an example of \"body horror\" (as far as I can tell).Synopsis: WOUNDS begins watching the daily life of an affable bartender at a little dive bar and his small circle of friends/lovers and bar patrons. Everything begins reasonably and rolls forward with the story in a comprehensible and logical structure. Then some odd event or situation transpires and the depictions of Kafkaesque body horror sequences start slow and proceed to a nauseating, frenetic crescendo with everything making less and less sense as it progresses. Everything comes to a screeching conclusion in a sort of bizarrely distorted, apparently LSD-driven orgasm of repugnance. Roll credits.Given the above statements, I won't be able to write one of my traditional, thorough reviews. 99 times out of 100, not only do I detest body horror movies/stories but my personal opinion is that body horror movies/stories are structurally and artistically bankrupt.Yep. 99 times out of 100.Confoundingly to my personal perspective, body horror is a definite style and many accomplished and gifted writers and directors have created works in the body horror genre, and some of those works have been legitimately groundbreaking even to my limited comprehension.For example, the 1938 novella WHO GOES THERE? by John W. Campbell, Jr. is one of my favorite science-fiction/horror stories of all time and it's 1982 movie incarnation, THE THING, directed by the inimitable John Carpenter was simply incredible. Unequivocally, that story and that movie fall into the body horror category. Uh-huh. 1/100, I sayBody horror is intrinsically offputting and deliberately intended to be an unsettling, even nauseating, experience. Unfortunately, it seems to me, most artists simply lack the skill to push their art form so perilously close to the edge and still maintain their balance and present a cogent story teetering so far out on the fringe.Clearly, Babak Anvari, the director of WOUNDS, has significant talent. Before WOUNDS went irrevocably down its body horror path, WOUNDS was very enjoyable and entertaining. Good production values, competent acting, good sound and music, and so on.But the further WOUNDS goes down the body horror tunnel, the more it feels like Anvari loses control of the story. Of what we're seeing as an audience, what is real, what is imagined, what is the result of psychological distortion and is that really a distortion of reality that's happening? Who were the shadowy, apparently evil people operating in the background and what were their objectives? What was the purpose of using wounds to open up portals? What was the half-seen thing coming out of wound in Brad William Henke's face? And an endless collection of other questions that aren't answered or fully addressed in any way by the movie's conclusion. Again, as I always say, the story is all, and as it goes completely off the rails, so goes the movie.I guess it seems to me that my distaste for body horror partially stems from the fact that even otherwise talented directors exploit body horror's focus on nauseating, psychologically disturbing images well past the detriment to the actual story taking place. They seem to feel that if they have accomplished the body horror revolting and upsetting images, they've done their due diligence to the art form. Frankly, they haven't.Also irritating is the fact that so many of the body horror movies follow the same basic formula, and so it is with WOUNDS. Aside from the specifics of the story involving a bartender character and the context of a dive bar, the bulk of my synopsis above applies pretty reasonably to most of body horror movies I've seen.I've given WOUNDS a 5/10 simply because I couldn't think of a more reasonable number driven by any kind of logical rationale. I hated WOUNDS. I think it's complete crap. The director seems to have talent and I have no idea why he presented the story in this way. And, at the same time, I'm afraid I'm allowing my personal sensibilities to influence my judgment which might strongly imply that I'm being unfair. So, 5/10.If you want to see one of the supposed \"classics\" of cinema body horror, watch 1983's VIDEODROME. Bleck.",

In the beginning of the movie we see a man getting a severe wound in his face, so are we to understand that that is the trigger for all the following events? And what are the multitudes of cockroaches doing in the story?\nAs I said, Armie Hammer did a fine job, I hardly recognized him from the prizewinning \"Call me by your name\", here he plays very convincingly a self-indulgent, macho, two-timing alcoholic bar-tender who gets towed-in by some supernatural force, but Hammer couldn't save this shaky vehicle by himself.

In fact, the first 15 minutes or so, did arouse some curiosity. A fight breaks out at Rosie's bar where Will (played by Armie Hammer, who's one of those non-expressive Greek gods) works as the bartender. He finds a phone left behind by one of the teenaged customers and takes it home.Thereafter, everything just goes topsy-turvy. He gets bizarre texts from a random person. He starts seeing unnerving things - I hated how the screen just kept cutting to fleeting shots of vile things every other minute. His girlfriend Carrie (played by Dakota Johnson, another non-expressive performer; wait she was good in Peanut Butter Falcon though!) starts acting weird, blacking out frequently.The screenplay also adds an annoying relationship angle amid the ongoing horror. While this is supposed to contribute to Will's deteriorating life, it just felt terribly executed. I like Zazie Beetz but even she disappoints in Wounds. Everything I loved about Under The Shadow is undone by this effort - dull setting, monotonous jump-scares, a host of uninteresting characters, and little to no emotional connection with the plot. The climax was laughable and only raised a giant WTF question mark (not kidding!).",

With that being said, there are some very frustrating things in this movie.1. The movie feels like it is 10 minutes too short. The ending is definitely a disappointment.2. I don't care about the main character at all. The entire reason that he is the perfect vessel is because he is an empty and hollow human being. At the end of the film I was wondering what emotions the director wanted me to feel about this story. Apart from feeling creeped out by some genuinely eerie sequences, none of the characters were likeable, and the, although interesting, concepts were undeveloped. If I'm honest, I found myself rooting for the otherworldly demons to break through because, at the close of the film, they ended up being the most intriguing part.3. It felt like a pointless movie. By that I mean: the story wasn't complex enough to be conceptually exciting, the themes weren't scary enough to be a great horror movie, the characters were either amoral or average so there wasn't an underlying moral that I could find.This movie is \"fine\". The acting is ok, it's pretty creepy, the dialogue is meh, the themes are undeveloped, but novel.It's fine.",

The premise is so good I honestly want a better movie about that than this weird forced love story thing.No commitment to any idea in this movie, every idea is abandoned (sometimes literally) like a reverse Checkov's Gun: if we show you something, then it doesn't mean anything.The movie literally just ends.

It would be comically bad for Armie Hammer's performance; I don't think I've ever seen an actor try harder to make lemonade out of a lemon like this script. Unlike Dakota Johnson, who-speaking of phones!-is truly phoning it in with her acting (albeit in a surprisingly small onscreen role, given that she's billed as the co-star and is playing the girlfriend, but honestly this is the least of this film's problems).Where to even begin?First off, it starts with a Conrad quote from the literary masterpiece, Heart of Darkness. And that says a lot about Wounds' biggest, most glaring flaw of all: it wants so badly to have MEANING. This technology! These phones! Look what it's doing to the youth, to SOCIETY, man? You could have made a movie about an evil cursed cellphone that seeks to awaken alien spirits (?)-which this movie is also about, believe it or not-and not tried to do overt social commentary. That movie might have also been terrible, but hey... options.During one of the endless streams of bad dialogue, one character calls another character \"a mock person.\" And that stuck with me, because this is a mock movie. It doesn't know what it wants to be. Hard horror. Satirical critique. Interpersonal relationship drama. But, in addition to Hammer giving it his all, the film looks like a film. It's visually competent and there are actually some nice shots. But, alas, this is a mock movie. It takes elements that would otherwise be a major or *the* major crux on their own (the college kids and the cellphone stuff, the Afghanistan war, Dakota Johnson being sucked into a laptop void, cockroaches! etc etc etc) and lets them all rot. No threads are either elaborated on OR completed. Your theory on what any of this means is correct. Congratulations!You'll likely stick around for the \"catch.\" Of course you will, even if you know it's gonna be incredibly underwhelming. Or in this case: absent. Everything is unearned and half-baked. And by the end of it, when the cockroaches are literally crawling on the camera lens, you'll be left wishing they'd been there the entire time to shield you from having watched this nonsense.",

It's pretty vague in terms of what the thing driving the horror is, but the character conflict and the suspense and the not knowing are really well-defined.So, the characters aren't exactly the most having-it-all-together kinds of people. Everyone in some way is pretty messed up.Horror fueling drama is an interesting creative decision and it feels like what you might expect of the first horror stories being written in terms of suspense and fear, cutting back to earlier times in the genre, with a basic modern twist to the genre through the cellphone and Internet.To me it was well-executed, with a both interesting and unexpected cleansing of the innocent scene and firing up of the depravation of the already depraved, consuming the rot of what's found in one's own soul by taking that of another.It's different.

The ending was a joke.As far as the acting, Hammer was mediocre, and Johnson was so bland and lifeless I wondered at times if they'd just had a bored crew member stand in to read lines for Hammer to respond to instead of getting an actual actor. The supporting cast were much more interesting, so maybe it could've been something good from their POV, watching their friend spiral into a breakdown.

The movie is more or less just a sequence of random disconnected stuff thrown together.But that's not my biggest issue. My biggest issue is that the main guy doesn't have an ounce of rational judgment. Here are some examples.1. He comes home late, finding his girlfriend glued to her laptop watching some creepy endless animation. Asking her about it, it turns out she has amnesia and doesn't remember anything that happened. Given this overwhelming evidence for something extremely serious and dangerous going on, his reaction is to not talk about it further and break up with her at the next day for fairly unrelated reasons.2. After the above, he doesn't attempt to do anything whatsoever that could possibly resolve the situation. He just goes back to work and gets in trouble being rude to other people there.3. Near the end of the movie, after being confronted with even more evidence of weird supernatural and dangerous stuff, he calls some woman he's close to, and uses this opportunity to... tell her that he's left his girlfriend and complain that she doesn't want to leave her boyfriend. The fact that he's being in a horror movie right now and his life is probably in danger is utterly inconsequential to what he decides to talk about. That was baffling to watch.I just want to have my characters behave in a way that makes sense in their respective situations. That's kinda essential for good story telling! This movie utterly fails to deliver on that front. And it's not like the point is that he's losing his mind; this isn't being conveyed and his actions never made sense in the first place. He's just a gigantic idiot, and watching him is very annoying.At least the movie could have been nice enough to kill him for some satisfaction, but alas.The directing is pretty good though.

Following this decent if slightly unremarkable set up, writer/director Anvari's sophomore effort spirals into nonsensical garbage. Based on Nathan Ballingrud's novella The Visible Filth, Wounds is the very definition of a film that is all tease and no pay off. Every character introduced to us is unlikable, which is a shame given the talent involved. Hammer, Beetz and Dakota Johnson (appearing as Will's dead behind the eyes girlfriend Carrie) make do with what they've got, but in the end no performance is remotely captivating. It felt as though production began without a completed script, as character motivations are often unclear and practically nothing regarding the supernatural disturbances are explained.

Why?What were the photos about? And the visions?How did Eric get the phone? In fact what is Eric even got to do with any of the events between the initial fight and the final scene?And what's with the Tunnel??

When he picks up the phone from the college students (small cultist group maybe?) they planted a device and he happens to pick it up and called a phone number through that phone which activates the device. The phone then acts as a portal for higher beings to come to our world. But they need a hollow vessel. Wills life slowly becomes more and more empty as he begins to make poor decisions that eventually leads to him having no one and anything. At that time he becomes the perfect vessel and one or more of the higher beings using the wound from eric (man with gash face) to transport through to Eric.

He is SO much better than these rubbish \"cheap scares\" !!!!! I'm angered even writing this review. I mean, watch it for the laugh of it all; just to see how stupidly pointless the whole movie is.

At least that is what I understood was trying vainly to be conveyed but it was confused and poorly conveyed to the viewer relying on quick glimpses of occult books and the bad choice of actors made it all the worse. Armie and Dakota were just so not the right actors for their roles even though they performed well, they just did not fit in! Or perhaps the alternative understanding is that he was just going insane and everything he was seeing was in his mind which is a somewhat more simplistic explanation of everything in the film?What is it with all these arab directors and producers these days? I haven't seen one decent horror movie from any of them this year or is it maybe we just do not understand the Middle Eastern way of thinking about what a horror movie actually is; perhaps this is the Iranian horror style? who knows but this just descended into a confused and arty farty ever so clever crew disaster sadly and comes nowhere near the Turkish movie \"Baskin\"!Finally, throw in the old cockroach horror cliche for some unknown reason which has been done to death and the film falls flat. If you want to watch a real cockroach classic that disturbed me and even now 40 years later it still gives me the shivers try the excellent creepy Bradford Dillman 1975 cult classic \"Bug\" - Now that is how to scare with cockroaches, this on the other hand well...meh!",

Not finished. I could not believe it finished when I did not expect it to. I am disappointed. This is less about horror and more about negativity. There are feelings of desperation, disappointment, anger and how it is when life just does not make any sense, when we lose people, job, meaning. But it is only analogous to that, with completely bad story and meaningless. Unreal and negative. Not the worst but only because of those few realistic and exciting things like fights, and weird behaviors. But as a whole this is bad. Meaning few good acts and ideas, but bad story.

The movie pretty much hinges on Armie Hammer being able to make his character's descent into darkness interesting and believable, and he pulls it off.

This film provides no clues.\nIt's such a sad waste of potential, as I feel this movie could have been really something. The acting is good, especially from Armie Hammer as Will - drifting through life, somehow convincing himself he is content with his dead end job (that lets him get drunk every night), his relationship (Will and Carrie are more like two strangers sharing a bed). His only \"interest\" in life is Alisha, and possibly only because he knows she is unavailable.\nThere are so many ignored threads that could have been woven together into a taut supernatural thriller - the messages and photos on the mysterious phone; the growing number of bugs everywhere; the tunnel and the strange effect it has on Carrie; why was Will considered \"chosen\"; the \"wounds of translation\"...\nIf only the author of the original novella had allowed someone else to screen-write and direct the film - they might have been able to pull a cohesive story out of the weeds.",

I have avoided going into the plot as there is absolutely no point as nothing is linked together, this modern idea of letting the audience interpret the end is nothing more than pure laziness as it lets the creators off the hook to bring together the threads of the movie.

            "content": "This is what happens when filmmakers are more fascinated by imagery and concept but don't know how to couch them in a story.Armie Hammer is Will, a bartender in a New Orleans bar who witnesses a fight break out one night while some college kids are in the bar (seemingly unrelated). The kids leave behind one of their phones, which contains disturbing images. All the while, his girlfriend Carrie, played by Dakota Johnson, seems to be studying occult Gnosticism, which seems to be related to what the college kids are involved in.If you're looking for any kind of payoff in this film, you're going to be sorely disappointed. Literally, this film has no payoff. It's more just a bunch of stuff that happens and then, BAM!, end credits. There are times that it seems like it's going somewhere. In fact, it felt like there should have been much more interrelated stuff between different parts of the movie, such as Claire's professor, Steve, being more developed. In fact, I definitely get the impression that this was supposed to be the case, but that it either ended up on the cutting room floor or remained concept-only. It's possible that this happens in \"The Visible Filth,\" the short novel on which this movie is based, but since I haven't read it I can't comment on it.The film we get is not a good film, either. The acting alternates between melodramatic and completely emotionless with no inbetween. Seriously, Brad William Henke is so over-the-top, he makes Jeremy Irons look like he was on Xanax during the \"Dungeons & Dragons\" movie. Dakota Johnson just sleepwalks through her entire role. Armie Hammer feels like he tries a little too hard to be the everyman. The only actor that seemed believable with genuine subtlety in their role is Zazie Beetz, but her character is pretty much superfluous to the proceedings. Her character could have been cut with little to no change to the plot.What's so terrible about this film, though, is the sheer frustration factor. It's a great idea. I would have loved to see more and have the movie cleaned up to be more cohesive and have an actual payoff. But we're denied all of this. I love the concept of basing a film around occult Gnosticism. However, it's set in such a poor movie that by the end, I found myself wringing my hands less out of fear or feelings of bugs crawling on you (which you might get) and more out of frustration for failure to realize its potential and seeing very easily how it could have been saved. When you're doing the filmmakers work for them, they've got a problem.",

Of course, this theme never gets past infancy and you are left wondering what a wonderful movie could have developed.The acting is beyond horrible for the main roles. There are a few side character roles that were played well.The dialogue is laughable where it isn't supposed to be. Or perhaps it was just the wooden and monotonal delivery.I was so disappointed after watching the previews, because it really appeared that there was a decent budget involved. So many movies in this genre have shaken cameras and terrible sound tracks and stage settings that look like they were recycled from ghetto high school productions. Here, the lighting was good, sound quality decent , but those were the only highs and positives to be said about the whole movie.The special effects are just weird and make no sense. Roaches randomly running about. An occasional bloody scene of something obscure thrown in and you are never quite sure what you are looking at or why. Not scary. Not gross. Just sort of strange and weirdly misplaced and not quite funny but certainly not horror provoking either.None of it ever tied together coherently in the plot department and abysmal acting just kept me cringing.",

Where the story and character development sorely lack or suffer from cliched writing, the production makes up for in smart editing and scare tactics. Wounds may lack in jump scares, but it does an excellent job at using the irksome creepy-crawliness of bugs and backsliding, crippling addiction to craft a charmingly dark and ominous tone throughout the movie that helps compel the viewer forward despite a rather abysmal script dense with one dimensional characters, obscure referencing and borderline-schizophrenic editing/post-production.Wounds isn't much of a film to write home about and it ultimately fizzles out, feeling like nothing but a lump of purely wasted acting talent and discarded plot potential. Like many indie horror films before it, Wounds suffers from a truly engaging concept but fails to effectively execute and deliver a quality plot arch that satisfies. It's nothing more than wasted momentum enshrouded in an poorly woven tapestry of interesting ideas and badly written dialogue.",

They're also hard to care about, because you're not given enough time with any of them for them to become fully fleshed. The plot jumps and twists, but not in a way that feels deliberate. It's almost as if the writers came up with a unique concept but didn't fully understand it themselves, and so the whole film flounders without really going anywhere. Just as you really think things are developing, the film ends so abruptly that you're left feeling cheated.

Will lives with girlfriend Carrie but they aren't too happy together. Will longs for friend Alicia but she already has a boyfriend. Will sees murder scenes on the phone he picked up when customers in the bar dropped it. Will is inexplicably reluctant to take the phone to the police despite having friends on the force. Will goes home one night to find Carrie inexplicably catatonic from staring at a website screen she learned of via the phone Will found. Inexplicably, Will doesn't take her for medical help. He just puts her in the bathtub and runs water. This inexplicably cures her. Then they break up for reasons unclear. Now Will is free to go after Alicia but she's not interested. Neither of these relationship issues has anything to do with the plot. They just needed to add running time to the movie. Will visits the sick friend and opens his mouth so that millions of large cockroaches can fly out of the friend's mouth and into Will's as the scene fades to black and the movie ends.The movie is inexplicable. Nothing makes sense and few things have anything to do with one another. It is pure, absolute garbage. It is 1 hour and 35 minutes of your life that you'll never get back.

            "content": "The film's title is deliberately open to interpretation. Unfortunately, so is much of the story.The movie starts off intriguingly as you are introduced to a host of interesting characters in a fairly progressive scene. Unfortunately, what you will have witnessed is the film's peak after about only 15 minutes. Cue 80 minutes of a confusing, convoluted mess. You are carried along a twisted story whilst trying to understand what is going on for most of it. There are some dark scenes which lead you to a false sense of security due to their terrorising nature. However one cannot be frightened of watching something if one does not know what to be frightened of, or indeed why one should be frightened. It is almost like the movie tries to encapsulate every theme going without developing its own identity. Is it a horror? Is it a thriller? Is it a drama? Everything about this film is open to interpretation, even its theme, it seems.The thing that shocked me the most about this movie however was the misplaced profanity. It is utterly pointless and adds nothing to the movie. It comes out of nowhere. Dakota Johnson randomly dropping the C-bomb does not hide the fact that she is awful in this film. You don't see a lot of her (in more ways than one, you can thank 50 shades for that) and delivers an (expected) wooden performance. Armie Hammer and Zazie Beetz do deliver good performances, considering the terrible script.The turning point in the film's story is what lets it down entirely, and is a massive plot hole. The film's antagonists deliberately leave something to be found by their next victim. Now, if you intend on manipulating someone with an object you leave behind, logic would suggest that you would ensure your victim can access whatever it is with ease, in order to become manipulated. The way the film shows how the victim accesses what was left behind is utterly ridiculous and just would not happen in real life without a lot of effort. Which makes you wonder what has happened to other victims, or rather those that couldn't access the object left behind. It is utter nonsense.What you hope to receive by sticking with the film until the end at least is (as much as can be, considering the circumstances) a satisfying ending. Instead the final scenes do nothing but add to the confusing mess you have already witnessed. You are ultimately left with only two conclusive feelings; confusion and annoyance. Confusion over the entire story and annoyance that you just wasted almost 90 minutes of your life that you will never get back.My conclusion is that you avoid this at all costs. You have been warned!",

And the other stories set in the same timeline/universe.There are quotes, and hidden references everywhere... For example:The movie begins with a quote from Heart of Darkness by Joseph Conrad.Carrie's essay seen briefly midway through is about the allusions in TS Eliot's The Hollow Men, which itself began with a quote from Heart of Darkness.... And her professor's surname is Conrad.(Carrie's surname is Lynch which could be it's own reference!)A recurring phrase in the author's fiction is \"Maybe heaven is a dark place\"... Reflecting (I believe) that the supernatural is by it's very nature unknowable, and that fragile concepts like \"evil\" don't necessarily apply to beings beyond our capacity to understand.Both Heart of Darkness and The Hollow Men deal with the emptiness inside is where we imagine a soul to be, and whether morality can be ever said to exist.In the book version the kids make reference to both Eric and themselves being \"just nice suits to wear\", while in the film the shallow nature of social media and Eric's life is more implied than explicit.However the film instead explicitly states the ritual inclined is gnostic, and the website Eric views on his girlfriend's laptop makes reference to the wound being used to open up a portal to \"Pleroma\"... Which is a real concept, and has been translated as simultaneously meaning the spirit world, the act of filling an empty vessel/making something incomplete whole, as well as referring to the individual higher beings themselves.The concept of human beings being shallow and incomplete runs right through the book and film. From the author's other works, the kind of \"fulfillment\" that is being offered is far less transcendent, and more like we would use a latex glove... Something to be used and discarded, torn and ruptured from having been written by something far greater than ourselves.This is one of several examples I've found so far, just as in the story there is a whole hidden, deeper layer to everything, which only those driven enough to pursue will find... Effectively making the viewer/player act out what the protagonists are doing.If you enjoy games like Cultist Simulator, or Lovecraftian fiction, this is the movie for you.",

The idea is a sound one, and I was curious to see what was made of the \"found phone\" trope, but sadly what could have been a halfway intelligent meditation on people's search for meaning - finding \"missing pieces\" of ourselves within each other - descends very quickly into cheap horror movie cliches that are never evolved beyond brief MacGuffins.Armie Hammer's performance as Will - an \"average\" guy who isn't especially likeable (he drink drives, tries to cheat on his girlfriend, and honestly hasn't got a single remarkable or interesting thing going for him) - is steady, especially next to an incredibly weak Dakota Johnson as his partner Carrie, with whom Will's relationship is foundering.What starts as a promising cross-section of characters - including Zazie Beetz as Alicia, 'the one that got away', and Brad William Henke as Eric, a boozy regular at the bar whose pack of unreasonably large, meatheaded friends can't keep their testosterone in check - is never fleshed out, so instead of symbolising Will's isolation and lack of fulfillment, the paper-thin people around him just feel like bad storytelling and poor adaptation on the part of screenwriter/director Babak Anvari (though admittedly I haven't read the novella Wounds is based on; I have no idea if that's any better, or just as concerned with indulgence of and apologism for its flawed protagonist).The plot - such as it is - feels like a shoddy rip pulled from the first couple of urban legends found on a Google search page, and never serves as anything more than a vehicle for Will's by-the-numbers traipse into insanity, culminating in a very dull \"evil within\" ending, which drowns us in CGI instead of building any true tension or showcasing the human callousness and disconnection that sits at the root of evil (as per the Joseph Conrad quote that kicks off the movie).To see a handful of reviews claiming those who didn't like this movie \"didn't get it\" or want \"easily packaged entertainment\" is a real shame, because it's a mistake to attribute anything about the panning of Wounds to anti-intellectualism. It's not that this movie is too ambiguous or artsy to understand... it's just that it's bad. Simplistically bad. Rather like The Perfection (2018), it's a movie that exists to frame a couple of set pieces and a vague concept, but it doesn't furnish the viewer with enough plot, style, or atmosphere to make that worthwhile.Wounds is boring, weak, and fundamentally both a waste of the viewer's time, and its own potential. If you're looking for more challenging spooky fare this Halloween that meditates on life, connection, and reality, try something like Boys in the Trees (2016), Jacob's Ladder (1990), or even Only Lovers Left Alive (2013), to start with.",

Otherwise you'll just find it confusing, a waste of time, boring and that it sucks, etc etc. This one's for a rather narrow audience, and if you're not a part of that audience, you'll probably not like it at all. I happen to be part of that audience, and I love to use my imagination, so for me it was a good one.I'm not interested in seeing the monster, or having everything explained. That breaks the illusion for me, unless the story is about the monster itself and not a protagonist being confronted with said monster. I'm not intellectually insecure or lazy like that, so I prefer it when I have to work my mind while watching a movie, even though there's a charm to simpler movies as well. But this one will have you either feeling misled, insulted, bored to death, whatever of the same or like, or it will have you thinking about what actually is happening. I found the slow burn, the setting, the obviously flawed individuals in it, and the creeping mood coupled with the growing sense of dread and total doom refreshing and I loved the ending of it.Nothing is explained, unless you really pay attention to certain details and know what they mean; even so you still have to kick the imagination into gear, and that's why it has such an impact on the receptive ones. I for one think it's a very good movie in lots of ways, and as far as the horror part goes, it provided eminently exactly that. I felt very ill at ease when the credits rolled, and that was the whole point of it.If you want to watch it, then do so, but be prepared for disappointment, unless you're like the very few, like me for instance, who appreciates 'the not so wrapped up in a pretty little bow for your lazy mind's convenience'- movies. Then I think you'll like it more than you were prepared for. Watch it, or don't; you won't miss anything, or you'll miss one of the creepier movies out there.",

However, after being \"chosen\", he begins to see horrible visions all around him, which i guess are meant to signify how rotten his life has become... driven mad by this, he quits his job, breaks up with his girlfriend, and finally gets closure with the other woman... all of which seem like healthy steps toward becoming a \"better person\" - he just gets there in the most gross and confusing ways imaginable. He then accepts his new \"better\" life by embracing the creature which bursts forth from his conveniently-wounded friend, in the hope that it will \"make him whole\" (his girlfriend previously insults him for being an empty, hollow person, so this could be his motivation).\nAre his visions the result of this existential crisis? Alcohol-fuelled mania? Some sort of curse? How & why was he \"chosen\" in the first place? I've done my best to interpret some semblance of meaning from this movie, but it's badly-told at best.

This movie probably tried to do something like that but it ended up as a disgusting mess (literally) and that's a shame, because the cast is decent and that movie could have been way better if they would have stuck with one idea and tried to make sense of it. Instead the movie takes from almost every horror movie (from the stupid demonic phone challenges movies), to Cronenberg's body-horror and also H.P Lovecraft and Franz Kafka's existential literature. Again, nothing bad in taking inspiration from others, but when you are doing it so bluntly and just putting these themes inside in order to put them there it's actually offensive.For example, Will feels rotten, small, his life is meaningless and his existence is insignificant you know, like Kafka's metamorphosis? Hence why the viewer is subjected to endless CGI cockroaches hunting the screen, and even a revolting vision of a cockroach hiding inside Will's armpit. You know, one or two of these would have been enough for the intelligent viewer to understand but noooo let's over-use this disgusting imagery and insult the viewers instead. And why exactly? Because instead of putting some effort into developing Will's character and hint toward his emptiness we will show him being a bit of a jerk to others and again, lots of roaches.And there is this weird creature of the void which can be summoned through, wounds, why? because someone googled it online? No seriously, there is nooooo background to this. How did these college kids found out about the ritual from the first place, what is this ritual? why would you even summon that creature? Does it give you anything? There is not reason behind it. No explanation why Carrie (Will's girlfriend) is hypnotized and possessed by the vortex she encountered, why don't they trust one another? Why does he even care if he basically wants this other girl. For a sec there I thought it might make sense but the movie just drops everything in the last act and we end up with Will willingly letting that whatever creature go into his open mouth while begging it to make him whole. But the movie never for once claimed that this creature will do that, or anything at all. No, I am supposed to understand that in the last 2 seconds of the movie because that's what the character is whispering in a really disgusting scene.It's such a waste and again, could have been actually an interesting movie because the concept is interesting, the actors are good and Armie is really pretty good in portraying this nice guy who is fun to be around but also pretty hallow.",

After the excellent Under the Shadow, rich with its cultural identity, historical context and social commentary, Babak Anvari hits us with a fairly generic (though nicely cast) supernatural horror film. At times it had potential, it could have truly dived deep into a kind of gory lunacy but just when it seemed like it was about to take the plunge, we got a lame jumpscare, or some CGI insects.In my opinion it should have tried to do more from the 'body horror' angle, and less from the whole occult thing. Feels played out, hopefully his third project (whatever/whenever that may be) gets back to what he achieved with his debut, not necessarily that I think he should return to folk horror, just that he should try to touch on something more personal and original again.This could have been directed by literally anybody else and it'd be the same product.",

Were there edits that need to be changed?And then it was released on Hulu. I saw the film and I saw why it was pushed back. This film was DISAPPOINTING. Like it came at a surprise. I'm always open to horror, as long as it isn't just Blumhouse making them. But this was odd. It started fine, but as the story continued and the CGI cockroaches started to appear more they lost me with an off the wall story with a cast that try to make too much out of too little.I know this could have been better, and I'm excited for Annapurna's future films.

It reminded me in its intention of a combination of House of Leaves (in the uncovering of Uncanny Media, to say the least) and Angel heart (in the New Orleans setting and the unlieable Anti-Hero central character who stumbles into the center of a plot far greater than he, to which he has no understanding) which sounds great but was executed in such a dull way that it left me just wanting to read the book as I was intriqued by the premise.\nIn the execution, I was bored stiff by the opening 10 minute sequence set in a bar which is 'supposed to' set up the action. I say 'supposed to' because its a long pointless scene that is extremelly dull and flat and does not tell you much about what is going on a=or about to happen or much about any of the characters. The most interesting character is the protagonists ]girlfriend who is set up with an interesting character but does very little in the film, even after very strange things start to happen to her - she just comes to her senses and leaves the story once more leaving the viewer wishing we were walking out the door with her.\nWould love to read the story as its a great set-up and leaves you thinking; if they chose to make a film out of this then the source material must be great - but can't find it for sale anywhere.",

Our confusion is also aided by the fact that the story only follows through the perspective of someone that is going crazy, and so naturally we start to associate ourselves with our only point of view. Several situations indirectly suggest the presence of loop-structures, which in part serve the purpose of marvel at the creators creative planning and self-awareness. Although loop-structures can also be associated with nonsense by a surface level evaluation. A large portion of the entertainment is inevitably fueled by our intellectual curiosity, as we reflect on what expectations the creators tried to provoke, in order to inevitably subvert them. Since this reflecting requires us to hypothesize the intentions of someone trying to confuse us, there is a built in loop structure within the action of this reflection, and which inherently makes the analysis difficult. In turn we obtain significant confusion resulting in an intellectual state of terror.",

But a short while into the film (about 20 mins) I realised that it was going to be just another Netflix original.The actors in the mix of the film provide a glimpse of hope but that hope is quickly turned into dread when the film gets underway. Hammers performance is perhaps the best of the bunch - and believe me that is not hard at all. Johnson looks like she was forced to star and Zazie Beetz is under used in the overall movie.The only positive I can draw from this film is the standard of effects. Netflix being the streaming giant that it is, has money to put into films like Wounds. The films effects are good (not great). They are fairly realistic and show a slight glimpse of hope for the future Netflix horrors.",

It's as though it was made by several people who all weren't taking to each other at any time during its making.\nBarely anything in this film makes a lick of sense, and there's little motivation to try and make any sense of it, because the characters are all such one dimensional bores, that you soon stop caring about anything that might be happening to them.\nWhat's so frustrating, is that you can see that if this wasn't such a confused mess, there actually could have been a decent film here.",

What does the other part of the movie consist of, you might be asking?\nWell the rest is basically Armie Hammer's character Will (who was TERRIBLE in this movie by the way) just moseying around at the bar speaking uninteresting and boredom inducing dialogue to random background characters. Occasionally, some \"horror\" happens which you guessed it, is not scary AT ALL. The film ended with a cop out ending where you find out nothing about the ritual.

            "content": "It's really difficult to critique this movie simply because not enough actually happens for the viewer to critique, it's very deliberately obtuse; a series of events without any explanation as to how, why, who or what.The acting is incredibly dull, with none of the characters having any chemistry with one another; no one seems to be putting in any effort to lift the film in any way. This film has a run time of 95 mins but due to its glacial pacing and sheer lack of energy from everyone and everything, it feels like 3 hour film.A lost phone and some cockroaches are supposed to serve as macguffins but again, nothing is explained and the viewer is left with an ambiguous, anticlimactic ending. As Shakespeare once said \"All sound and fury, signifying nothing...\"",

I feel like I didn't even watch it, nothing meaningful stayed with me. I am a HUGE fan of horror story telling, I absolutely love Stephen King's books and have a library full of them, I love a good movie, discover a good story, after all that is why we're watching or reading a story! \"Wounds\" on the other hand has no story. I had no idea what Wounds was about when I pressed play and still have no idea what it is all about when it ended. By tomorrow I will not even remember I watched it lol. At least \"The Nun\" and other titles mentioned in some high ratings to attempt a comparison have an actual story and an actual PLOT, the audience know what the story is about all the way to the end. I would watch those twice rather than watch this meaningless movie again. Hey some people have really low standards and get happy with whatever is fed to them, good for them, won't judge.On the other hand I want something more, I want to live the story, feel the character's emotions, guide me through their world just as they see it. I want to see DEVELOPMENT in the story, I want to sit at the edge of my seat and be kept on my toes. That's why I rate it 1 out of 10. This movie delivered nothing to me.",

What did the college kids at the beginning have to do with anything? What's the deal with the tunnel and the eye? What is the entire reason/story behind the happenings?\n\nTo top it off, the main character is intensely dislikable with apparently no redeeming qualities at all. I spent the entire movie just WISHING whatever the evil presence was would just end his ass already.\n\nAnd Dakota Johnson....sigh. How did she get to be cast in ANYTHING as an actress? Her performance/role in this film is just as it has been in every other film I've seen with her in it - a bland cutout cardboard person with one expression who adds nothing to the movie at all. \n\nDo yourself a big favor and avoid this movie like the plague.

The music background is appropriate to theme and the twist was enough to appeal the viewers. But the problem with Wounds is its story also and its execution in the film. I felt something lacking in the flow of the story as some points were not explained until the end. I also feel that is not complete and too much unexplained mysteries in it. Nevertheless, it is worth to take a one-time chance to watch it.",

It tries to do too much which leads to it failing to follow a storyline and instead focus on story moments.

The performances are tedious. The direction and script is stupid and dull. The film lacks scares and thrills. It feels like a terrible version of The Ring movie. The plot is boring. It follows a bartender played by Armie Hammer. After a random fight happens in his bar. Some teenager left their phone which he picks up. He looks at the pictures which has a disturbing dead person. From there on, his life is spiraling down when a strange car has been following him. His obsession over his friend played by Zazie Beetz. While his girlfriend played by Dakota Johnson is distant. And everywhere he goes there seems to be more cockroaches running around. The plot plays around with the concept which it barely explains in the movie about a teenager opening up a portal. Where wounds is the opening to another world. Nothing more is explained besides that. You spend the rest of the movie watching Armie Hammer's character going insane with his drinking problem. Mood swings. And obsession with his friend. The direction is boring. The characters make stupid decision. Such as right when the character brings home another persons phone. Which he sees a red flag text message. It takes him forever to get it to the police station. By the time he does, he loses the phone. Armie Hammer, Zazie Beetz, and Dakota Johnson are all great. But there roles and characters in this film are a waste. The characters are flat and dull. The film lacks in scares and thrills. Besides a disturbing ending which leaves you asking what did you just watch. Kind of a reaction. Overall, Wounds is one of the worst films of this year. It is boring. It is stupid. The direction and story is so tedious. It makes it hard trying to sit through it.",

            "content": "This is what happens when filmmakers are more fascinated by imagery and concept but don't know how to couch them in a story. Armie Hammer is Will, a bartender in a New Orleans bar who witnesses a fight break out one night while some college kids are in the bar (seemingly unrelated). The kids leave behind one of their phones, which contains disturbing images. All the while, his girlfriend Carrie, played by Dakota Johnson, seems to be studying occult Gnosticism, which seems to be related to what the college kids are involved in. If you're looking for any kind of payoff in this film, you're going to be sorely disappointed. Literally, this film has no payoff. It\u2019s more just a bunch of stuff that happens and then, BAM!, end credits. There are times that it seems like it\u2019s going somewhere. In fact, it felt like there should have been much more interrelated stuff between different parts of the movie, such as Claire\u2019s professor, Steve, being more developed. In fact, I definitely get the impression that this was supposed to be the case, but that it either ended up on the cutting room floor or remained concept-only. It\u2019s possible that this happens in \u201cThe Visible Filth,\u201d the short novel on which this movie is based, but since I haven\u2019t read it I can\u2019t comment on it. The film we get is not a good film, either. The acting alternates between melodramatic and completely emotionless with no inbetween. Seriously, Brad William Henke is so over-the-top, he makes Jeremy Irons look like he was on Xanax during the \u201cDungeons & Dragons\u201d movie. Dakota Johnson just sleepwalks through her entire role. Armie Hammer feels like he tries a little too hard to be the everyman. The only actor that seemed believable with genuine subtlety in their role is Zazie Beetz, but her character is pretty much superfluous to the proceedings. Her character could have been cut with little to no change to the plot. What\u2019s so terrible about this film, though, is the sheer frustration factor. It\u2019s a great idea. I would have loved to see more and have the movie cleaned up to be more cohesive and have an actual payoff. But we\u2019re denied all of this. I love the concept of basing a film around occult Gnosticism. However, it\u2019s set in such a poor movie that by the end, I found myself wringing my hands less out of fear or feelings of bugs crawling on you (which you might get) and more out of frustration for failure to realize its potential and seeing very easily how it could have been saved. When you\u2019re doing the filmmakers work for them, they\u2019ve got a problem.",

This may be one of these movies where you have to go off your own theories, but honestly it seems poorly constructed, jumpy, and a little incomplete. 3 stars for giving it some good moments, and definitly some creep factor and having you reaching to cover your eyes at some uncomfy spots but... overall just didn't bring it after building it all up.
