Story is too shallow where a lot could have been explored in a college life.Tiger is mocking audiences in the face, instead of being a stuntman he is being projected as an actor just because of nepotism in Bollywood.",

The script was cringworthy, the dialogues were illogical and everything was rubbish. surprisingly the newcomers gave good acting performance. I really love tiger Shroff but it's high time for him to look at scripts before signing. He is still in his baaghi mode. Don't watch this movie. Don't waste your money or time. It's tatti.",

I sincerely urge the audience to not watch this movie in theatre and give that money to some needy person or watch some underrated good movie or watch avengers again.Don't support such cinema and nepotism culture , if you give them your hard money like that ,this menace of nonsense movies with talentless starkids will never end and every year they will launch dozens of nepotised trash.\nAnd kjo seriously need to quit Bollywood.\nThis movie was made to just wash the kalank of #kalank.\nBoth kalank and soty2 are super worst movies of Bollywood history.",

Spending so much on location, songs and dance would not give the inception of a good film unless script is thoroughly worked upon.SOTY2 tells the story of 3 friends with the Kabaddi Inter School competition at the background - Rohan (Tiger Shroff) who joins the college for his girlfriend, Tara Sutaria. There is a spoilt brat, Ananya Panday, who thinks she can rule the college with her care-free attitude.Director Puneet Malhotra (I Hate Luv Storys, Gori Tere Pyaar Mein) does not do justice to the area of direction at all. As the movie begins, you are greeted by glossy and candy floss environment of college (reminds you of Kuch Kuch Hota Hai and Student Of The Year 2012 ) with unnecessary insertion of songs. The main drama unfolds in the later reel which again is intolerable with screenplay written surely by a school kid. Art direction and Cinematography is excellent especially. Songs are poor. Dialogues are less-impacting. Performances are over-top. Tiger Shroff does his best but could not do much with the lame script. Glam dolls -Tara Sutaria and Ananya Panday are meant for making the film more attractive.Overall, a pathetic film in every sense.",

The movie has no heart and fails to hold your attention unlike Jo Jeeta. Tiger, yet again has the same one tone dialogue delivery and expressions and the same goes for Tara and Ananya.The film has flashy songs, costumes and acrobatics galore. The director wants you, the audience to cheer for Tiger, whose body is broken in half in a Kabaddi match(?) but Tiger's lack of acting range makes even that impossible. You could probably pop into the theatre post the interval and still get the story or the lack thereof!\nSo, wait for it to come out on platforms like Netflix or Prime. Save your money!",

            "content": "I am a Screenwriter and Director so I don't really like to be harsh with my opinions because I know what effort goes behind making films.I also know for a fact that a script goes through multiple changes in the course of the making of a film. Obviously at the start their is a script and then the director brings in his sensibilities that change the script. Actors add their own ideas as well, and in the final stage of editing, the editor along with the director make final changes to the story and it is then that we get the end product.I'm giving this backstory because in most cases this is how a film gradually progresses to it's Final Cut, but I can't seem to find it in my heart to say this for SOTY2.I wish there was an option for no stars because if there was, that's what I'd give to this film.First, I don't understand why the indian film makers want to keep making terrible versions of the same film over and over again. Second, the concept had no new quotient to it, so why the hell bother making another film.Except 2 songs, all the songs were rubbish. Again, what's with the constant remakes. I'm really bored with this culture. The direction is awful. Acting I wouldn't even like to comment on because the less I talk about it the better. There is definitely potential in the artists in the film but they were underutilized. The characters barely had an arc, unnecessary storyline and confusion created that makes the film look like the work of an amateur.I wish Ananya and Tara started their career with different films so we could actually see their talent. ( I do think given good roles and good direction they could do well)Tiger was doing a repeat of things he does and He looked really bored doing the same thing. Cut the guy some slack and give him something good to do - like please!Also I feel terrible for actors like Gul Panag who were just an absolute mockery in the film. Not to miss Will Smith who chose this film of all the films to fulfil his wish to be part of a Bollywood number - wish someone had warned him what he was getting himself into.Like I said I want to give the film a 0/10 but since I don't have that option I'd give it a 1/10.",

To Tiger's Credit he has done his job well, he's great at dancing and so in fight sequences but is it enough to make a great film? NO ! Sorry We are not in 80's where people would flock in theaters just to watch Amitabh Bachchan bashing a couple of goons. Audiences are becoming smarter and looking for better content.And there's no content in SOTY2. This is a recycled version of the landmark bollywood film 'Jo Jeeta Wohi Sikander'. Just add some random songs, different situations or scenes but the film is more or less the same. The original SOTY was nothing great but Karan Johar knows the pulse of his audience. He knows how to get them in theaters. So he provided the right dose of entertainment, skin show and songs and people somewhat did like the first part.But Punit Malhotra is no Karan Johar. He has missed the mark totally. OK I get it that they wanted to throw a fantasy world of students right in front of us which we can accept given if we are really entertained, but where is the content? The reason why Baaghi series work because Tiger does exactly what he's known for. He's loved as an action hero but sorry ! how can he play an action hero while playing a student? And even if he does, the situations are hilarious to believe.Secondly, both the girls are a waste. I don't understand about the appreciation Ananya Pandey is getting. All I could hear is the word 'duffer' from her mouth atleast 60-70 times in the film. She acts like a papa's princess which can be hardly called great acting. And for Tara Sutaria, oh boy! what were the writers thinking? The poor girl didn't even get a proper developed character so its hard to expect any great acting from her. She switches boyfriends in the film but is never really sure whom and what she wants.The actor who leaves some what impression is Aditya Seal but then again even his character is riddled by cliches. Music is a Big Letdown. Not even a single song is worth remembering. Also the film drags in the portions between Tiger-Ananya-Tara. They just don't leave an Impact.On the plus side, some scenes do make you laugh and they come mostly from Tiger's gang of friends. The scene at the pub in the first half and the second one when they ridicule Aditya Seal during the opening ceremony of The Dignity Cup. But they are very few and far in between.Problem of the film is predictability, the same story we must have seen so many times before which is why the audience has rejected this recycled piece of trash and rightfully so. And it's high time our producers should empower good writers who can deliver good stories and directors with better execution",

The prequel has that lightness and overwhelmingness depsite some flaws it had and now the SOTY team decided to go beyond their redemption by keeling a sequel for the audience.So the story evolves around a middle class chap Rohan Mehra who scores a seat under the sports quota in Saint Theresa. Mridula a.k.a Mia is Rohan's childhood crush who is also a student there and Shreya, the most popular gal in the institution. Manav is the son of one of the trustees as well as Shreya's brother who has a cold shoulder with Rohan with the ambition of defeating him to become Student of the Year. How Rohan's ambitious dreams come true basically forms the backbone of the story.What was Punit Malhotra smoking before coming up with such a cocaphonous flick? The story was very predictable and too nepotistic because of what power and influence of one person can do to another person who doesn't have these traits. Dialogues were too \"dramabaazi\" meaning too 80's for such a delicate film.Acting had some slight redemption but only for the newcomers.Tiger Shroff acts basically like he is auditioning for a film for the first time just like his other films. Too much fighting and just seeing him kick ass and dance isn't going to make acting a redeeming quality.Tara Sutaria was the only potential figure in the acting department because she had that natural glow of a college student and she was decent throughout the movie.Ananya Pandey was also decent and she didn't disappoint at all. She had that personality of a popular college girl with snobbiness which is something to look for in a popular gal.Aditya Seal didn't do much besides bullying Rohan throughout the film and same like Tiger Shroff, same identities but opposite.Samir Soni, Gul Panag, and Ayesha Raza were fine as well but had short roles as they were educational figures.Music was very average at best and no song stood out as such although Jawaani was a beautiful recreation but evrything else around was sub-par. Seems like Vishal and Shekhar overthought some things while composing.Cinematography was well executed by Ravi K. Chandran who shot Dehradhun beautifully but transitionally, it was loose in terms of editing.Overall, too nepotistic and predictable2/5 - Grading Scale: F -53%",

As a student, apparently everyone wishes for such a year, though we are obviously fearful of repeating the class, but we are happy that these students can have it, due to such a well thought out script.",

However, in 2019, Karan Johar's movies became so boring to watch. After a huge flop 'Kalank', there is 'Student of the year 2', which is another flop.\nFrom the cast of the movie, the plot, the music, and everything are so boring to watch.\nThe plot is a typical story we always heard of. There is nothing unique, different or interesting.\nThe cast, especially, Tiger Shroff can dance well (we agree on that without a doubt) and he can do the stunts all right. But acting and emotions, he needs to work on that. (Sorry to his fans) Other characters couldn't make any impact on the movie either.And when Karan Johar selects cast for his movies he needs to think about it twice. He should think about the skills, not the parents/relatives of the actors or actresses.If someone wants to watch the movie so badly, go ahead. If someone wishes to see a movie which is different and exciting, this is not a movie for you.",

He has Tiger Shroff as the typical boy next door with a lower middle-class background and a dream to fulfill the dream of his uptight and arrogant girlfriend (Tara Sutaria), all of which will give you a heartache. Another two of his dreams is to get that throne in the sports competition and get admitted to the college of every student's (reel + real) dream. A college where academics do not exist. And where instead exists people like the obviously arrogant incumbent Student of the Year (Aditya Seal) looking to hit a hatrick this time and an equally arrogant, daughter-of-the-trustee (Ananya Panday) who wears couture and who would barf at the idea of flying coach. While Seal's and Shroff's characters compete with their abs and looks, Panday's maverick presence makes up for unwanted idiocy. Each of these characters, along with a few essential supporting ones like Shroff's and Seal's on-screen friends, and faculty who never touch a book or a blackboard, throughout the 150-minute ecstasy-filled colouring competition further make this is a blunder of Himalayan proportions.There's so much colour in Student of the Year 2, I thought I was looking at a fashion show from the future. Shroff's character, currently just managing to make his ends meet, uses DIY techniques to style his threads but in the next sequence they are as good as to be used in walking the ramp. Every single character - including the extras - wear fashionable clothes that had me sitting in the theater wearing PJs and a loose tee, making me want to approach the style partner and say hello. Unfortunately, the film quickly scrambles to show you ads for Subway and a chips brand (Too Yumm!), which is slightly irrelevant considering they are pushing fashion textiles for the most parts. So I lost track.Shroff flexes, jumps, leaps, flies, and sometimes falls flat on his face in Student of the Year 2 and there ends his performance as this aspiring young man who does not look one bit his character. While Panday and Sutaria do qualify as kids, their performances are strained at best, failing to add the charm that was present in the lead actors of the 2012 prequel which had more panache, pizzazz, romance, and fun. Harsh Beniwal as the designated joker and Seal who puts up an attractive show as a villain at the age of 17 should have won the award if there is ever one that celebrates worthiness. The little humor and the hunger for passive vengeance that is brought out by these characters are the only saving grace in this otherwise slipshod treatment of exaggerated high school life that is 3-fold worse than anything you have seen of this type in Bollywood, including Farah Khan's Main Hoon Na! (2004). During the viewing, I did wonder why Malhotra and his chums did not take a look at international films. Maybe a scene at the detention center or a professor actually teaching a concept in the background would have made me hopeful instead of a frame showing students sitting in a packed class and other where two characters assemble at the principal's (Samir Soni in a 50% comic role) office so that they could add some family drama into the mix.But what poses as the biggest threat for this musical comedy drama's success is its waferthin and illogical plotline. The turns that it takes - with the women taking sides, blabbering to show they are cool, unbelievable sports performances with Kabaddi looking like a wrestling match - Student of the Year 2 goes overboard in everything that it tries to showcase. And it probably takes great pride while accepting that they are into exaggeration. Unfortunately for the audience, it does not work; neither in entertaining not making us aspire to be like these overzealous, fake characters. There's so much going on in student of the Year 2, it becomes difficult to keep track, with plot arcs often defying logic or continuity. It slowly turns into an unbearable piece of content that you would immediately want turned off. Since you chose to view it on the big screen, the only solution is to walk out.Whether it is the physique that Shroff has maintained or that Malhotra failed to digitally edit (like they did in Aanand L Rai's awful Zero (2018)) or that none of the songs inspire fun are some of the other factors that make this experience not worth your money or time. The film throws challenges at you one after another, treating you like a kindergarten kid who will clap and jump at everything glitzy and noisy. It is for that reason that I do not recommend Student of the Year 2. If you really like high school romance films, try the prequel and then forget about the genre in Bollywood unless someone more talented and experienced people than Malhotra come on board. But that's an ironic statement. Both Malhotra and writer Arshad Sayed (who surprisingly also gave us the fantastic Dasvidaniya (2008)) are to be blamed for taking this idea from Karan Johar and dismantling it, butchering it into a product that looks tasty and good, but is poisonous if you consume it. We need to stop promoting this cannibalization of the industry.Sometimes there has to be a little realism or logic or even a bit of genuine emotions in the proceedings to justify a fantasy so ridiculous as this, but I guess that is something you already knew. Student of the Year (2012) at least had a mention of academics. And 7 years later, even as education boards in India dole our 100/100 to their top students, a film comes with a tag of nepotism without a second of studies that should have been fittingly named \"Spoiled Brats of the Year\".Save for the 5-second performance of Will Smith that you may miss if you don't pay attention to the half a dozen opposite-of-glee songs in Student of the Year 2 and a few one-liner jokes by the breakout star Harsh Beniwal (whom I would like to see as the lead if they ever make Student of the Year 3), this one here will tickle your fantasies that are best left untickled. Do something better with you time if you don't want to go window cloth shopping. TN.Originally appeared in the Little India Directory (Singapore).",

            "content": "A small town boy Rohan Sehgal (Tiger Shroff), madly in love with his childhood sweetheart Mridula (Tara Sutaria), follows her to city's top college. But this new term brings friends, foes and cut-throat competition along with heartbreak. Will he bounce back and beat the odds to become the Student of the Year?\nPretty young things in designer wear, dapper dudes with rippling muscles, scorching hot-wheels and a colourful campus buzzing with all sorts of extra-curricular activities - Welcome to the class of 2019 at Dehradun's most upscale college Saint Teresa. It's a place where all things are pretty and glossed over. Film's leading man (Tiger Shroff) fits right into the scheme of things when he secures an admission with a sports quota. He comes from a lesser privileged college, where students don't have the luxury of fancy cars and fashionable clothes. But his many talents start becoming a cause of concern for the current poster boy of Saint Teresa, Manav Mehra (Aditya Seal). Add to that, Manav's sister Shreya (Ananya), the college brat, who thinks of herself as no less than a princess, is all set to take on Rohan and embarrass him at every given opportunity. This sets the stage for a testosterone led confrontation of one-upmanship that involves love, ladies and competitiveness. Much of the story revolves around the four main characters, who fall in and out of love without much ado. There's no heartbreak too deep that can shatter them, or a punch so strong that it can break them. The narrative stays sweet, simple and along predictable lines.Tiger Shroff pretty much carries the film on his well-toned shoulders, and his sweet boy charm works for the part. His strengths are showcased with skill and attention - whether he is dancing like a dream, running on the tracks (the camera accentuating his muscles and sinew in close-ups), playing kabaddi or flipping in the air and landing with a blow.While film's leading ladies Tara and Ananya are glammed up to the T and flaunt the best designer wear that money can buy, their roles aren't tailored to perfection. Especially, Tara's character doesn't seem well-etched out. While her screen presence is impressive, her performance is average. Thankfully, for Ananya, her character gets a definite curve and a convincing backstory that works in her favour. Her performance gradually grows on you, especially in some of her meet cute scenes with Tiger. Ditto, for the film's anti-hero Aditya Seal. He pulls off his part well, looking every bit the classy, rich spoilt brat.While there was far more scope for comedy, some of the best laugh-out-loud moments come from Tiger's gang of friends. Among them, Harsh Beniwal leaves a lasting impression with his wisecracks and comic timing.Director Punit Malhotra ensures that a lot of drama and action remain out of the classroom, with focus on sports, dance and romance, not that the new age campus kids will complain. However, the chemistry between Tiger and the two debutantes doesn't quite warm your heart. And while it comes seven years after SOTY, the writing doesn't seem to have come of age.\nMusic is quite average, unlike the previous SOTY, which had songs like Radha and the Disco song that could probably feature on your playlist, even today. The edit could have been crisper. With the story at hand, the film could have had a shorter runtime. While the first half is spent in setting the tone of the film, second half gets a tad more exciting when the drama and action unfold. The film does make you nostalgic about Mansoor Khan's 1992 hit Jo Jeeta Wohi Sikandar, of course, this one is a modern-day snazzier version.\nOverall, SOTY 2 doesn't have that Ishq wala love, but there is ample dosti, high school drama and cool stuff to keep you going. It's always fun rooting for the underdog and you'll find yourself doing that here, too. There's not much to fuss over, but for the young campus generation, it's a fun and breezy watch. With enough lessons in styling and fashion (out of syllabus, of course).",

Supporting Tiger and Ananya because they are celebrities kids is what nepotism is about. Karan needs to start producing new actors/actresses who aren't already privileged. I've seen a lot of tiger shroff movies. He just doesn't have the lead actor persona. But becuase he is the son of Jackie shroff he gets and demands that respect which is also nepotism. In Hollywood you don't have that happening because actors are respected becuase of their talent. Tiger has given flop after flop and he's still doing lead roles because of this nepotism in Bollywood. It's not that Tiger doesn't have any talent. Tigers dancing and physique are amazing. He definitely worked hard on both and his talent as a dancer is one of the highest level in Bollywood. If he continues acting I think he should consider doing supporting roles. The casting was bad. But then again everything was bad.Not recommended!!!!!",

            "content": "Since the influx of Netflix and other streaming services from abroad, the wannabe Indian millennial thinks theyre way above Bollywood romcoms.Add to that Kangana's attack on the industry when she herself is in it because of nepotism. Pancholi is an insider and she not only \"befriended\" him she had an affair with him in his house in front of his wife. Shows character.Karan and other insiders don't badmouth her she does- which shows her classless personality. You may not believe Hrithik Roshan at all, but believe the pages of the passport put up by the authorities which did not have the Paris / Schengen visa where HR apparently proposed to psychopath.In today's day and age if someone was dating anyone a) there'd be pictures and kangy Didnt have any and b) at least one paparazzi picture would have been shot given they are stars.To think she's more talented than alia is such a joke but people relate to kangana more because the average Person is always blaming the richer and better looking person for their own failure.Nepotism isn't just rich insiders helping rich insiders its every common man who asks his or her friend to forward their CV or who sleep their way to the top. The quota system is the biggest government supported nepotistic drive which no one talks about. Merit is rare anywhere and we the common people suffer when we get bad service and I have suffered with the quota system at hospitals and in law courts.Abhishek Bachchan and Uday Chopra are the biggest failures so at the end of the day your name can only get you in the door but your success rides on the success of the movie and your acting. In real life jobs irrespective of your failure to deliver you can go on working way past your retirement if you're in the government or an old employee of a private company. Unlike 9-5 desk jobs , the movie industry is not a traditional job and it's a business so in any business the father will want their kid to try their hand out so what's wrong with that?\nOnly outsiders have thrived and become insiders - and think of any big movie personality now they were all outsiders.Ok gyaan session over -Like we have a diet that differs everyday - one day we want ghar ka khana, the next pizza and the day after, some complex dish- similarly my movie diet is varied. When I want Ghar ka khana I'll watch a Wednesday or a Sarfarosh because it comforts me that Bollywood can write scripts. When i want a complex Movie I'll watch an andhadhun or drishyam. But when I want pizza , when I want to hang out with my friends and enjoy teenage pop culture - I'll go for movies like SOTY 2.We can't compare the genres.When it comes to SOTY 2- it was better than SOTY 1.\nIn SOTY 1 I didn't even sit up and watch the actors. Alia was actually launched in Highway, Varun in Badlapur and Sid is always a nice screen presence.\nIn SOTY 2 I sat up and saw Ananya Pandey- she's funny and grounded off screen and really impressed me for her first movie which even my favourite Alia did not with SOTY 1.The movie is bubblegum on crack but very entertaining. I prefer modern students strutting around in sports bras that they chose to wear , than \"authentic\" directors adding item songs in their films to grab the audience by the balls.Ananya's character Shreya is my favourite. Once you see the whole film, you understand why she is the way she is. The dignity cup feels like Diet Olympics. The sets and design are a masterpiece. Especially the classroom set in the Jawaani song - loved the chalk scribbles backlit floor and walls and fluorescent post it notes. Also loved the Mondrian inspired white and yellow wall in one song.Loved the music in Ananya's solos - they were some English lyrics but they are not officially a part of the OST .Did not like the screenplay at all. It was very clunky.Tiger is a tiger as always but I prefer him in Action movies than in romcoms.The other actors were forgettable and Tara Sutaria is the bimbo combination of all the 3 young actors from Mohabattein. Expressionless and annoying AF.Karan too has evolved from casting only stars to casting newcomers and this movie had no big names. I think it should work in cities and if it crosses 85 crores and I don't see why it should not- it will be called a hit and I want a bonafide hit for him. Kangana hasn't delivered in anything except Gangster fashion and Queen and the script gave her national awards not her personality and definitely not her acting as she is very replaceable.Amitabh Bachchan and Jaya Bachchan, kiron kher- they are better actors than Kangy and AB has national awards too- he is humble and has worked with Karan and no one in the industry badmouths anyone. That may be fake but it is classy to stand together in unity - which is not something Indians understand. Definitely something Kangy understands. Give her a mic and she will go on a rampage and Indians will clap.There is a lot of emphasis on coming of age and team spirit in SOTY2. Loved that they made kabaddi the main sport instead of boring cricket. It was Nice to see some Indian sports getting recognition.The class divide is believable and I loved the DIY scenes where Tiger makes his own cool as hell wardrobe. Which is a big step from Sid's poor background in SOTY 2 as he enters school in Ray bans. It wasn't unrealistic to me even then because to fit in, in this EMI age, even the most basic person Splashes out. But here, tiger is shown as a commoner who is not insecure like his rich or poor classmates and does not want to fit in. He owns who he is and that is the strength of his character.The competition goes inter college between 8 colleges and the competition itself was very entertaining. There are 2 \"study\" scenes but I don't like to dissect everything- this isn't a Inception.Sure the movie has its flaws because romcoms inherently do. But there are days you want avengers end game quality(which India is Incapable of but The Krish series is amazing) and there are days you want to just get entertained and not in a sleazy double meaning kind of way- then SOTY 2 is the movie.Hated the OST but the camera work in all the songs was amazing. Costumes were amazing too. Movies are purely fictional so reviewers picking apart the not a hair out of place blowdries , the fancy cars the campus - they need a life. There are many girls who doll up for school and college. There are many rich kids who come in fancy cars but it's driven by drivers in India. And larger than small cities campuses prettier than Kjos campus, exist in the real world where Harvard and Oxford have their own cities inside the university towns they're in.When Harry Met Sejal is the worst movie to exist, but people went for it anyway. Why? Because it wasn't made by Karan Johar so Kangana wasn't after it. She hadnt brainwashed the scandal loving janta. If you count your pennies that it is such a waste of money etc to go for Bollywood movies then movie theatres aren't for you.stick to Netflix.This is a fun movie. Try to have fun people.",

Obviously thats the title \"Student of the year\" he did everything he can in every academic activity to show he is the student of the year...so i dont know what other story is everyone expecting from the title \"student of the year\"in my opinion, its not a bad movie, a good entertainer.\nLove for the girl he chose at the end - didnt show much chemistry between them on the screen.\nTIger - compared to all his movies he acted much much better. looking back from Heropanti to this movie and baagi 2.....He came long way. i dont think its fair for you to put down someone who came this far.\nBoth girls - did a fair acting.\ni dont think anyone did bad acting in this movie.,",

The acting was really good, the visuals were stunning, the storyline was clich\u00e9 but it was still good. The dancing was questionable at points but it doesn't take away from the overall effect this movie had. It gave off a good message to follow your own dreams rather than following someone else's and putting them first. Near the end, this realization made a huge difference as the outcome was magnificent. The action scenes were filled with thrill and action. The character Rohan had a very nice body and it was fun to stare at throughout the movie.",

There were a lot of scenes cut of like the Indian Function, Ananya and Tiger on the roof of the College etc. You can expect a lot of fight scenes, Which is not really needed, I mean who has such brutal fights in collages and as usual Tiger Shroff was like a stuntman. Ananya and Tara acted really well. Their clothes were not something that students would wear to a college. The love story part of it was very confusing and the movie was focused way more on Tiger than anything else. There was a little reality in the movie. The songs are very catchy and nice tho, and there were some very funny scenes. It does portray more of friendship and gives a hint of rivalry, class, standard etc. The original SOTY was better than this. The movie made little sense and this movie is better for people 13 years and above. Overall i felt this movie was overrated. Kudos to Tara and Ananya.",

This movie just didn't engage me because it lacked any real focus on what it wanted to be about. The characters are paper-thin, and not particularly likable. I will say the one good thing about the movie is that it unintentionally hilarious at times and it felt like something that was so bad it's good in certain moments.

Tiger Shroff excels in his art of gymnastics and dance, yet it's disappointing to see so much potential go towards a movie that does not do his stardom any justice. His acting skills have matured since Heropanti, but he still has a long way to go. Overall, I was not as invested in this one as the first installment of SOTY",
