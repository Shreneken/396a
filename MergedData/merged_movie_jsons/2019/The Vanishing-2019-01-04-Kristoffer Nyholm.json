            "content": "The VanishingIt's nice to see Gerard Butler taking on a role that reminds us he can act and with a surprising amount of range.\nHe has become Hollywood's go to man for B movie action over the last few years.\nHowever in 'The Vanishing' he gives the stand out performance.\nWith strong support from Peter Mullan and Connor Swindells this film tells the story of three lighthouse keepers that vanished without trace off the coast of Scotland.\nObviously only inspired by true events Director Kristoffer Nylholm's film is a tense slow burn thriller that relies on the three actors to drive the story through dialogue rather than action.\nAs aforementioned it is Butler's performance that captivates the most as the three men discover a man washed ashore with a wooden chest.\nIt is apparent that the contents of the chest is rather valuable when three more individuals come looking for their property.\nNylholm's film never truly ignites. It instead smoulders. Tension is turned up by the three leads as their predicament gets the better of them.\nGreed, guilt and madness ensues in what Is a superbly crafted movie.\nIt's a shame Butler doesn't lend himself more to these type of roles and allow himself to flex those acting chops rather than his muscles.\nDon't get me wrong I love his cheesy action roles but here he's allowed to shine as an actor.\nMullen is the father figure of the crew and he is the one turned to for wisdom and advice whilst Swndells character is the naive new Youngblood.\nI recommend that you watch this film. It's slow but captivating like a good mystery thriller should be.",

            "review_title": "A Greek Tragedy on Film about Lighthouse Keepers vanished in 1900",
            "content": "The movie is a tragedy, an imaginary tale of what could have happened to the real \"keepers\" who indeed vanished back in mid december of 1900, and never heard of again.The truth is that nobody knows for sure what was the fate of the real three men at the Flannan Isle, and anybody's guess is as good.Theories abound about what really happened, from alien abduction to a giant wave, and anything in between.Was it a terrible natural accident, such as the three men falling down a cliff or down inside a cave? Or something more sinister as the men kill each other?Your guess is as good as mine.In the real diary entry logged by the real keepers, they write about a terrible weather \"as the one they have never seen in 20 years at sea.\"That particular entry in the book is extraordinary, having in consideration that weather reports at the time indicated that weather was fine and calmed and the first rain can in on december 17, 1900. That is baffling to say the least.Will we ever know what happened to those 3 scotish men, thomas, donald and james? sadly, most probably not, which is so sad, especially because they had wives and children.About the movie itself, i'd say its pretty good. i give it a 6.acting is excellent from the three main actors, as well as from the supporting characters. all did a good work, and the director set the grim tone right from the beginning.the drama unfold with camera close to the faces of the actors to emphasis the tragedy going on, no images from the beauty of the ocean and a blue scotish sky don't expect to see that.all is sad from the very beginning and the only laughs occurred when donald and james found gold in the chest. other than that, all is grey.i'd recommend the movie to anyone who likes thrillers and tragedies on film. no special effects just plain good old fashioned acting (good actually) and an ending kind of predictable, still enjoyable (again if you like tragedies).",

            "review_title": "Opening Pandora's Box",
            "content": "In the bonus track of the DVD of \"Keepers,\" the producers described the themes of their film as \"greed, paranoia, and isolation.\" It is a saga of how decent men can lapse into barbarism and madness. It is a tale of the \"de-civilization of man.\"The film is based on a true story of the disappearance of three lighthouse keepers on Flannan Island off the coast of Scotland. In the year 1900, the three men were a routine call of duty to operate the lighthouse. But all three disappeared and were never seen again. Investigations turned up no evidence of foul play. Theories of paranormal phenomena resulted from the \"vanishing.\"The twist that filmmakers give to the story is one that may not be attributed to the forces of nature. Rather, it was the flawed nature of the humans themselves that led to their undoing. There is a crucial moment in the film that it is turning point when Thomas, the leader of the lighthouse crew orders the other two men not to open a locked chest that has washed up on the shore under suspicious circumstances.The other two men, James and Donald, want to open the chest, but, for the moment, they abide by their leader's decision. But, in the middle of the night, Thomas himself cannot resist opening the chest. Thomas, James, and Donald then give way to their baser instincts by peering inside the small chest. The balance of the film is a concatenation of events stemming from opening Pandora's Box.All three of the performances were outstanding from Peter Mullan (Thomas), Gerard Butler (James), and Connor Swindells (Donald). On the negative side, the film was far too violent. After making the point about how the three men unleash their demons from the beast within, the film became depressing with so many gory fights and death scenes.In the early scenes of the film, it appeared as though the three lighthouse keepers would be doing battle with the natural elements. But it turned out that the perfect storm was set in motion not by the thunder, lightning, and wind, but by the human emotion of greed and the lack of restraint in refusing to honor the cardinal rule of keeping Pandora's Box shut.",

While this is quite somber (for a movie with Butler in it), it is not nearly as intense or good as that. Still the movie is at least decent, with nice play between the 3 main characters. With some added flavor of others thrown in.Being on an island can do things to your mind. When an outside \"force\" comes it adds a new ingredient to the mix. This is not always a good thing. And nothing comes for free either ... even if you don't know or haven't read up on the story, once you open something, you know you'll have to live with the consequences. Whatever those may be",

The first I saw was a creature flick with Ray Stevenson that turned out to be surprisingly enjoyable, more so than this one. The problem with this film lies in the writing, which is merely average and acceptable rather than being compelling.It's a slow burner when it doesn't need to be, and the running time does feel stretched at times, leading to repetition in terms of revealing character traits that have already been previously examined. The thriller aspects are handled better and things get more and more interesting towards the climax. Cast-wise, Peter Mullan is dependable and you can tell that Gerard Butler is relishing the opportunity to play something other than a stock action hero.",

            "content": "The director of \"Taboo\", a very intriguing premise, good mix of genres, pretty high metascore & Gerrard Butler - of course I had to watch this! Was I disappointed? Certainly. Mild spoilers ahead.It's an interesting story, one of those spooky historic little mysteries, that's behind the plot of this movie - it helds a hell of a lot more potential that this movie brought to the screen. The script is one the biggest flaws here, the pacing's next. There's a lot of long scenes centered around pieces of boring dialogues with little substance, but at the same time it feels like the filmmakers are extremely proud of their character writing, which they definitely shouldn't be. The story is interesting for about half of the movie, until the point when draggy pacing & unimpactful plot points just start to frustrate You. So those are the flaws, the biggest, anyways. Acting seems to be mostly on level, but, even though I feel like I can never rightly critisize actors performances, I have to say that Gerrard Butlers portrayal of a lighthouse keeper gone mad was pretty damn stale. Cinematography feels kinda shy, the beautiful setting is not used that much, for budgetary reasons, I imagine. \"The vanishing\" could've used a bit more violence as well, but there is a single pretty good little action scene. While the filmmakers seemingly tried really hard to create the grim, bleak atmosphere that's supposed to be there, they succeeded maybe halfway. It just doesn't get there really.Overall I would call this an underwhelming experience that leaves the viewer slightly angry because he knows it could've been better. My rating: 5/10.",

I thought the acting and story were fantastic. I see people complaining about the claim that this was based on real events. It was. The true story is that nobody knows what happened to the three men. This was simply a filmmakers take as to what might have happened. I have quite a bit of knowledge about what is known to have happened and the filmmakers did a wonderful job of including that in the movie. They simply filled in the blanks with what I thought was an intriguing story, and deep, engaging characters. Please don't let the overall rating dissuade you from watching. The people who didn't like this movie, are probably people who can't appreciate a movie without a high level of \"excitement\". I would give the flick an 8.5.",

Some scenes were either too long or short, too choppy or too fast.Where this film deserves praise is Kristoffer Nyholm's directing in his first ever full length feature film. Camera angles, close-ups/distant shots and directing his cast were all on point.Next praise goes to the outstanding score, which set the suspense and tension perfectly, and to the stunning setting visuals.Then there were the decent performances by all cast, especially Gerard Butler, but I did have difficulty in many scenes understanding what they were saying (accent perhaps).It's a shame such simple issues (e.g. hire a seasoned screenwriter to build on the story) weren't addressed, as I feel this film would have been near perfect. Nevertheless, still enjoyable and a well deserved 7/10 from me.",

Instead of turning it in they devised a plan to keep it, greed and guilt finally led to the demise of some.Here the three men operate a lighthouse on a small island off the coast of Scotland, a small boat, a chest of gold, and a dead man are discovered. At least they thought he was dead until he tried to kill his rescuer.They will be wealthy if they keep the gold for themselves but then others show up looking for it.

In fact, the entire thing suffers from a slight shortage of atmosphere. Therefore, while it's generally engaging and enjoyable, the experience is never exactly suspenseful or, even, all that compelling. Still, it's occasionally rather successful and isn't a bad effort overall. Despite some strange editing and pacing, the piece is relatively entertaining once it gets going. Its second act sees things really kick off and its third is marked by a surprisingly good turn from Butler. The finale is unexpectedly gentle, in a way. This is a testament to the movie's more psychological ambitions, which are appreciated even if they're not always lived up to. Look, it's not a bad film, by any means. It has an interesting setting and decent performances. It's just not all that affecting or memorable, though. You kind of get a sense that this same story could have been told a bit better. 6/10",

The supposed dead man attacks Donald who manages to kill him in self-defense. The locked box contains bars of gold and other people come looking for it.The start is slow. I don't like the opening text which is too vague and sounds like a ghost story. With the setting, that's what I was expecting. It also reveals the ending which does not help the tension. It should state the place and the date and the state of the place. It should not state that the three lighthouse keepers go missing. The movie takes a giant step up upon the arrival of the strangers. Those two have great creepiness. Their threatening nature heightens the tension. The middle is very solid and I had high hopes. The last act is a bit disappointing especially after the strangers.

Having read the accounts of this incident, that happened 4 days before Christmas in 1900, there is no possible way this movie should exist. If so it would be three guys getting off a boat onto an Island and then men coming to replace them and finding nothing. Because NO ONE KNOWS WHAT HAPPENED!!\nIt is also supposed to have happened in December..On an remote Island off Scotland. You know how friggin' cold that is? But the men just go outside with no coats. Also, by law, there always has to be 1 man maning the station. But so many times the three of them are outside.\nThere is this 1 small, small, small, hint at what might be transpiring (In the movie. NOT in the true story) At one point the men find mercury had spilled out of the light from the lighthouse. They all put on these hazmat suits and Gerard Butler's character tells the young kid about the hazards of \"Liquid Silver\" and a little later on we see Gerard Butler staring into the light and talking gibberish to himself and for a quick second they shoot to a small puddle of mercury at his feet. So I assume that meant he got poisoned and he went berserk? I have no clue.\nIt was Pretty to look at, The acting was good, But the story was a bust! Waste of what could have been a good film.\nHopefully someone takes it and makes a movie about the incident with the investigation. That is something we know happened.",

It's quite an interesting method of story-telling, to speculate fiction on a real-life occurrence, but I kind of like it. There are hundreds of events over the course of history you could do it for. Did this one work? I would say it did.I had a feeling going in this was going to be a slow-burn film that would really test my patience (I mean three men alone on a lighthouse island, how much could really happen?) but thankfully I was wrong. Not only was the pacing not an issue, it was actually one of the strongest points of the film. I liked the fact that we knew the outcome from the get-go as well. That wouldn't always be a good thing in a film but on this occasion it worked because it kept us invested and wondering how that was going to turn out to be the case.The accents of the 3 main actors can be quite hard to understand at times. Subtitles could be your best friend. Otherwise though this is a pretty hard film to fault. The story has quite a natural progression which never feels forced and then the rest of the film's positives just flow from there. I had a really good time with 'The Vanishing' and it is one I would recommend.",

You can figure out the rest quiet easily, but it's a psychologically tense movie.Our two main leads are Peter Mullan and Gerard Butler, and the latter (believe it or not) is exceptional in his role. Probably his best acting ever. All the lead characters are spooked in the excluded location, and trying their best to think of a rational escape, but things are never so easy.The film is strangely complex but simple, hard edged but has morals too. It's a fine movie. The only big problem is that it is derivative in some ways, but you can bypass this. I still enjoyed it for what it was.

It is one great chunk of gratuitously violent fiction based simply on the idea that three lighthouse keepers disappeared without a trace, and that is probably the extent of the true bit of the story. If I were a descendent of James, the only one with children, I would be furious at the slur cast on his character. And who was the ill-fated Charlie and what was he doing on the isle? Couldn't find a trace of him even when running the film again up to the point where the men disembarked at the lighthouse.

Then a storm descends and when it clears the lighthouse is surrounded by dead seagulls. A wrecked rowing boat is discovered and a seemingly dead man attacks one of the keepers, a chest is also found. This turns out to be Pandora's Box for all concerned. A bleak film, Peter Mullan as the head keeper puts in a convincing performance as the man with a plan, motivated perhaps by his past losses. The violence is savage at times but given the road traveled is perhaps inevitable. More savage thriller than horror. Directed Kristoffer Nyholm from a screenplay by Celyn Jones and Joe Bone. 7/10.",

            "content": "I heard about this story listening to Coast to Coast AM. As I recall there wasn't any closure as to what happened to the three Irish lighthouse keepers. This movie takes a stab at an explanation which is to say I doubt it is the actual turn of events, yet it's compelling. It's a dark tale using the element of three men not particularly compatible having to work in unity in a very isolated job for months at a time. Just in this aspect it's a fragile co-existence. In a best case scenario they'd be, like soldiers pulling together as brothers, but in a unforeseen chain of events this might come unhinged. The writer/director goes for the worst which may still make a deranged kind of sense. Guilt and greed careen with each responding differently. Since there is no definitive answer this one has a kind of macabre trajectory unfolding slowly creating an all-encompassing tension. Yes I said slowly and I do mean S L O W L Y. The empty space will be the polarizer it's likely for some, but think about music where I believe it was Duke Ellington who was adept at the space between notes. This slow empty causes a dark cloud to become another player with a strong presence. Patience will be needed and with that one can see this horrific tale is a quite real possibility. As I understand none of the three were ever found or seen again, the film rightly chooses Thomas as the possible lone survivor who could probably disappear on purpose as he was at a particular stage in life where he'd already lost his family. The real mystery, of course, remains intact though I think this movie comes away with a possible answer.",

When they come across another stranger that washes up ashore with a chest. These three men try to debate on what they should do with the chest, if they should keep it a secret when they return to the main land or get rid of it. While being isolated, they begin to question their own insanity.I love the three cast members Gerard Butler, Connor Swindells, and Peter Mullan. But their performances are dull and boring. When they come across a few strangers and they get attacked. It just gets worse from there with their performances.The story was dull. The psychological part of these guys either trying to stay sane or their own personal greed can get in the way. There was not really much to the story. These characters were boring. The script was lacking in development even though it does set it up well with these three characters. The film does lack thrills and a sharp direction. It just feels like one long chore of sitting through the film.Overall, The Vanishing is a terrible film. The cast was boring with the characters. The plot was a waste for a psychological thriller.

The initial mystery was supposed to take place in December, the setting in this movie does not look like winter to me. There are so many things that have been left out.I know that this is (possibly) artistic license but if you're going to do a movie about the unsolved mystery of The Flannan Isles then at least do your research otherwise change the names and do not base it on a real event.The setting and acting were superb which has saved it from a 1 star review and there's a solid bit of violence about half way through but other than that you have nothing.Initially I was excited at the prospect of seeing what the film makers made of this mystery but ultimately I was left angry and wholly disappointed.",

The first act was very believable, you could almost smell the salt and feel the wind. It gets more interesting by the time the main plot element is set up, it builds up tension, nice dialogue and the sense of danger.While the ending made sense and was quite foreseeable, the beginning of the third act was a little bit confusing. The movie tries to dive deep into James's (Gerard Butler's) character, but it feels like we barely know him. It's harder to understand what is going on in his head and why he does what he does.I think if they wanted Butler's character to be as important as they've made him, they should've spent more time developing him in the first place. The way they did this just lacks depth, this could've used better writing. This way it also wouldn't have felt too slow at times.Not a bad movie, but it leaves you with nothing (maybe this was the idea though).",

But I had to force myself to watch this thoroughly depressing movie until the bitter end, just in case it was a giant bird that carried them away as some legends would have it. None of the characters was in any way likable. They seemed fed up with the job even before they climed aboard the ferry boat to take them to the island. Once on the island, things didn't get much better. Both older men seemed to have it in for the young guy, but what did he do to annoy them - apart from being young? Then they got all their priorities wrong by not concentrating first and foremost on getting that radio fixed. Without a radio and no other means of getting help, any one of them might have suffered a heart attack, a broken bone, or a nasty bug requiring immediate hospital treatment. Was the Northern Lighthouse Board willing to potentially sacrifice the health of three of its crew members as soon as it realised there was no communication possible? And where was the railway, used for transporting supplies? This existed in 1900 and wasn't removed until the 1960s, yet we saw not a trace of it.After the defeat of the Norwegians, if I had been Thomas, who appeared to be in overall control, I would want to visit their boat to see if I could find out about them. Whether they were pirates, common criminals or whatever. Also, by doing that, Thomas and the others might have discovered the young boy who didn't need to die.This film is a complete con from start to finish.",

In real life, it's no mystery: a hurricane pounded the isle so hard it twisted the metal railing out of shape and a boulder that weighed a ton was moved. The table was set for a dinner that was never served. The inspector from December 1900 reasonably and with evidence concluded that two keepers went out to tie down a piece of equipment (one was previously fined a lot of money his family couldn't afford) and were either blown off the cliff or washed off with a large wave; the third keeper went out to help and was also removed via storm. These isles are off Scotland, and I can assure you, we Celtic folk aren't satiated by some boring storm. It's got to have a massive ocean beast and some kind of faery. This story is so much more mainstream as to be palatable to Americans, and I enjoyed the fun they had with the facts of the case. I thought running with the mercury poisoning was a good touch, and flat out laughed and rolled my eyes at Gerard Butler and his antics for an ending. I enjoyed the actors' performances and I enjoyed the complete deviation from history to just have an entertaining story that might get you talking about what you would do on an island like that.

            "content": "Never take anything that doesn't belong to you. We have seen this many times in the movies, when people appropriating ill-begotten wealth always end up in a bad way. The ending is almost certain a foregone conclusion.This latest variation on the same theme is based on the mystery of the Flannan Isles, off the coast of Scotland, where three lighthouse keepers disappeared in December 1900. No one knows what happened. The men simply vanished from the island.This speculative script does not involve anything supernatural. Everything that transpires is the consequence of human actions. A chain of events that sweeps the men past a point of no return.The lighthouse keepers - Thomas, James and Donald - played by Peter Mullan, Gerard Butler and Connor Swindells respectively, arrive on the island for their six-week stint. They quickly set into their routine, doing maintenance, lighting the lamp, and taking turns with the cooking and chores. In a small compound on an isolated island, each man has his place, whether he's a seasoned captain or a young novice.Once the introduction is done, the movie dives straight into the start of the mystery. Almost by pure chance, the men catches sight of someone washed up onshore under a cliff. Donald climbs down to find the stranger dead, with a heavy wooden trunk. While James and Thomas pull the trunk up by rope, the dead man, who turns out not to be dead, attacks Donald and out of self-defense, Donald kills him.Before they're able to fully process the aftermath of killing another human, they find gold bars in the trunk. James and Donald are euphoric, believing this will change their lives forever, as Thomas remains cautious.Then a boat arrives with a couple of sinister looking fellows asking for their mate who fled with their loot. The keepers lie; and they know the intruders know they're lying. Before the night is over, violence will take over and the intruders will be dead.Like a storm that comes out of nowhere, everything changes in an instant. The keepers make quick plans, split-second decisions, which only land them in the deep end and for more than one, a swift descent into mental meltdown.In a confined environment with nowhere to run, the next few hours become emotionally charged and tense. Director Kristoffer Nyholm skilfully takes the movie on a sharp turn in mood and atmosphere, all the way to its unsparing and bleak conclusion. By this time, he has also developed character sympathy as we learn about how Thomas's wife and babies died many years ago, James's young family waiting for his return, and Donald's unrequited first love.All three actors give commendable performances. Peter Mullan is solemn and grounded as the one with the most experience, but his sense of caution doesn't preclude him from making some fateful decisions that might arguably cast him as a villain. Gerard Butler shows dramatic chops with a strong presence and a contrast between his brute strength and vulnerability. Connor Swindell's character shows the most change by the time he meets his end. A different man from the one who landed on the island not so long ago.Although the mystery of the Flannan isles happened over a hundred years ago, this movie shows it's lost none of the fascination. Naturally, with the disappearance of the men the story assumes the worst. Nobody comes home, and not all will survive. In the hands of Kristoffer Nyholm and writers Joe Bone and Celyn Jones, The Vanishing is a tale of fundamental human drives and bad decisions. Well made and moody, it deserves to have a wider audience.",

            "content": "Based on the true Flannan Isles mystery that saw three lighthouse keepers mysteriously disappear in 1900 without a trace, The Vanishing (formally known as The Keepers) creates an intriguing narrative with an experienced cast that once more showcases that greed is never good.Starring the brilliant Peter Mullan as elderly lighthouse keeper Thomas Marshall, Gerard Butler as experienced keeper James Ducat and Connor Swindells as upstart Donald McCarthur, Kristoffer Nyholm's bleak and grey coloured thriller places a capable cast in a somewhat predictable affair that sadly eschews mystery in favour of a more predictable and by the numbers affair featuring gold, insanity and cold blooded murder.Filming off the picturesque island surrounds that are found not far from the Scottish coastline, Vanishing is a rugged and realistic expose of lighthouse keeping life as the three men all from various backgrounds and situations find themselves pitted together and trying to hide a deadly secret that has the potential to change their lives should they get away with their dastardly plan.In this regard, Nyholm's cast are more than capable of delivering tension and nerve raddled performances, with joy to be found as per usual in Mullan's performance, thriving when getting away from side parts to take lead and it's great to see the capable yet often sleepwalking Gerard Butler invest himself in one of his best performances in years.Whether it's a Fallen film, Geostorm or submarine bore Hunter Killer, the last few years have not been kind to the one time Hollywood A-lister, with blame falling squarely at the actor who was clearly not pushing himself out of his comfort zone. Vanishing strips back any chance Butler would have of being a hero or one-note care free know it all and the increasingly unhinged Ducat finally allows him a character to really play into.The problem with Nyholm's film is that despite the mystery on which the film is based upon, Vanishing plays out in a mostly predictable and rather dour way, there's little flair or surprising plot developments to be found once the films key plot point is developed in the form of some washed up gold bars, which is a shame as much tension and intrigue could've been mined for the story and the audience had Nyholm chosen to keep things a little less by the numbers.Final Say -A great chance to see Mullan and Butler ply their trades in some meaty lead roles, The Vanishing is a solid if unremarkable thriller that could've been something truly special had it embraced the mysterious nature of its true story to greater effect.3 dead birds out of 5",

But this one is not even comparable to them (Greenland, has fallen, Hunter Killer). The only good things in this movie is that it tries to explain of the book or real event, that it is realistic because shows use how really desperate times call for desperate measures, and that camera crew did good enough job so that this does not look like vlog as most bad movies do. But no point, no surprise, no lesson. Boredom dominates. The only bit scary thing was those 2 sailors returning suddenly, which reminds me of real life small fears and unpredictable events.",

The older character demonstrates how to crack open a crab, a ten-minute scene that takes the time to focus on the younger man's facial expression in order to demonstrate that this is supposed to be alarming/shocking/weird/strange. The whole film is filled with slow, pointless scenes like this, stretching your patience to its limits. I fast-forwarded through a lot of this pointlessness, stopping only when it appeared that something interesting was happening, which of course they draw out as much as they can. Climbing down a cliff to check on a boat wreck? Gee that looks neat, let's see how much they will pad this scene. I remain hopeful that someday, someone will create an entertaining lighthouse film.",

Every detail seems real, including the lighthouse, the boats, clothing, instruments, jars in the pantry, speech and attitudes. But they squander this sense of authenticity with incessant jiggly-cam shots. These are not minor trembles in areas where one might expect difficulty using a tripod or some other rigid mounting system, like the spiral staircase leading to the lamp. In an early scene, a character suffers motion sickness. The audience can easily relate. Later, we meet a physically imposing character, played by an actor they might cast in a fight scene against Dave Bautista. We wonder why they couldn't get that guy to hold the camera, instead of apparently recruiting a skinny eleven-year-old on a gyroscopic board. The only time the jiggly shots don't disrupt the audience's willful suspension of disbelief is during a pivotal scene that is so dimly lit that it's impossible to tell what's going on.Rigid mounting systems require a lot more time and effort to set up the equipment, level the camera, make certain the actors hit their marks, et cetera, which forces the filmmakers to plan each shot. Properly done, it results in a tighter production. TV seems to drag a bit, as if it might have benefited from the careful planning entailed in using rigid mounts.Performances by Gerald Butler, Peter Mullan and the other are excellent. Aside from sloppy camerawork and too much action occurring off-camera, production values are excellent.",

A whole lot of violence going on. Possible mercury poisoning is hinted at near the beginning. Light-houses sometimes used mercury to help the lens rotate. If ingested or inhaled, mercury and fumes can lead to hallucinations, brain damage, and death.

The film makes up a combined horror and ghost story, about a stranded dinghy after a storm with a man in it, who appears to be dead but who isn't, and who goes to attack when awakened, resulting in disastrous consequences, which amounts to a complicated crime story of guilt and remorse, two of the men being haunted by imagined ghosts. It is well acted and well filmed, reminding of Michael Powell's \"The Edge of the World\", which was a documentary while this is more sinister in brutal realism. Films like this are difficult to like and enjoy because of their depressive character, while you must acknowledge the concept and turning imagination into realism.",

The mystery here is that no one knows what happened to the 3-men: James (Gerard Butler), Thomas (Peter Mullan), and Donald (Connor Swindells), the youngest and least experienced. When the new crew of Lighthouse Keepers arrived on the island, there was no one to greet them and hence the mystery grew. This movie provides a sort of answer, but no one knows what happened for sure.James, Thomas and Donald find a man washed up among the rocks with a small boat and a wooden box nearby. They think the man is dead, but comes to life and attacks Donald who was sent down the cliff to investigate. Donald uses a rock and hits the man and the man dies. The wooden box contains gold bars.A boat approaches with two men Locke (Soren Malling) and Boor (Olafur Darri Olafsson) who ask the three lighthouse keepers if they saw their shipmate with a wooden box. The men are told yes, and the man had been found dead and reported and is gone to the mainland as per protocol, but they claim not to have seen a wooden box. Later Locke and Boor feel the men were lying and they go back for their gold. Oh, oh...............Gerard Butler may have the big name, but this is Peter Mullan's show as he is the leader of the three. Great performances by all. Did the spilling of Mercury cause James to go mad? Hmmm...... Keep an eye out and see for yourself.The rest of the movie deals with tremendous guilt with James and Donald for the violence and coverup they participated in. Peter does his best to be the voice of reason with their unpredictable behavior.You can decide if the ending is a suitable outcome.

A fictional story about a true event, namely the disappearance of three lighthouse keepers in 1900 who stayed on one of the Flannan islands on the west coast of Scotland. The three men James Ducat (Gerard Butler), Thomas Marshall (Peter Mullan), and Donald MacArthur (Connor Swindells) have never been found. Nobody had a real explanation and soon several speculations circulated. From a giant sea snake to giant seagulls. Or maybe they went up in smoke to start a new life. Kidnapping by spies was also an option. Even an alien kidnapping. This film aims to give a more plausible explanation. But it nevertheless remains an unproven and therefore fictional story.Don't expect any supernatural apparition. First of all, \"The Vanishing\" is a realistic look at the life of a lighthouse keeper at the beginning of the 20th century. The rugged sailor life in which these seasoned sea dogs brave the briny deep unflinchingly as they make their way to that boulder in the middle of the ocean. Something rookie Donald clearly isn't used to, so he experiences the trip while hanging over the railing. Largest part of the film you see how these men dutifully perform their tasks on the island. Not that there's really a lot to do. The main task is to ensure that the beacon of the lighthouse is working properly and that the glass surrounding it looks optima forma. They spend the rest of their time singing, cooking, sleeping, and strolling around the island. Not really madly exciting.Until newcomer Donald finds a splintered boat, a lifeless drowned man, and a locked wooden box between the rocks. And when the content of the mysterious box is being revealed, the time has come for tensions to rise. From that moment on, mistrust and greed play a major role. There is such an ominous mood in the air. You get the feeling that every moment the situation will explode and one of the three keepers will erupt into violent anger. But ultimately the three don't pose a threat to each other, but third parties play a greater role. I won't reveal too much, but expect a serious escalation of the situation at some point.\"The Vanishing\" was a relief after seeing so many mediocre and forgettable nonsensical feature films. Not only the footage turns this film into a gem. The acting is also phenomenally beautiful. Not only the oppressive, claustrophobic atmosphere is impressive. There are also some melodramatic moments in which hidden distress comes to the surface, resulting in conversations full of meaningful silences and heavy words. You'll also witness some lurid scenes such as the cleaning up of dead gulls after a heavy storm (\"You may have to break the wings to get 'em in.\"). But for me, Gerard Butler was a real eye-opener. He usually appears in one of those a dime a dozen action films (with the exception of a single film like \"A family man\"). But here he also shows that he knows how to act. Never thought a movie about lighthouse keepers would be worth watching. Well, apparently it is. And that's also a reason to finally check out \"The Lighthouse\"! Lights out, lighthouse spotlight on.More reviews here: movie-freak.be",

            "content": "I saw this because I am fascinated by the real mystery involving the disappearance of three lighthouse keepers without a trace in 1900 in a remote Scottish island. To this day it remains an inexplicable enigma, though there are many theories trying to explain it, going from a supernatural event to an attack by a gang of pirates or to an extraterrestrial abduction. This movie presents a theory that is not impossible, but has many implausibilities.The most annoying thing for me is the constant hand held camera, unstable, trembling, even in long, static shots. It can't stay still? It ruins completely an otherwise fantastic location cinematography.Another thing is the number of anachronisms. Wireless radio was still experimental in 1900, there's no way they would have one fully available on the island. Also the lighthouse is fully electrified by generators. This could be possible, but it would require huge amounts of fuel to be transported regularly to such a remote location. It would be very costly, and would have to be delivered very frequently. The problem is that winters are very harsh in that part of Scotland, and very often they would get cut off from the mainland for weeks at a time. And finally, the boat of the intruders looks too modern to me. It seems to work with diesel fuel rather than steam.Also there are plot holes. Who are the intruders and what were they doing with the gold? They seem to be Nordic; how did they get there across the North Sea in such a small boat? When Donald is killed at the end, his colleagues take his body to dump into the open sea. Why not bury him on the island and explain his death later as an unfortunate accident? After all, he had a good reason to be there. It would look perfectly logical. Finally, the dog keeps disappearing and appearing again throughout the movie, and at the end supposedly is the only living being left on the rock. Still, there's no mention of a dog being found alive in the real story. Let us suppose they included it in the story just to fill the space.Entertaining enough for a night of adventure and mystery. Great locations marred by murderous camerawork. Turn a blind eye on the obvious anachronisms and it keeps you guessing till the end.",

Just one bad plot device and the whole momentum of the story shifts into ultra dark mode. Why would Thomas admit to having found the the man or the trunk? It made no sense. Since this was a fictional take on the mystery behind the story it could have gone in any direction but they went with extremely dark. As a result you lose empathy for the 3 main characters and feel like you need a shower at the end. It also dishonors the actual men that did go missing and I am wondering if the families were consulted. If you want to see a similar film that is much better check out Sam Raimi's A Simple Plan instead.",

From there on, the director Kristoffer Nyholm, takes a hold of the audience's nerves and never let's go.This movie is possibly one of the best suspense films i have seen in a long while. My mind began racing as I felt engaged and fearing for their lives. The action comes in a wave where each sequence leads to consequences that embodies the dark mystery of human will. Just what are the ends to human will when you really want something...at any cost....even if it's your own life? The intriguing part is how little we know of each character doesn't seem relevant.

This is a slow burner - an attempt to provide a possible explanation for why 3 men mysteriously vanished from their lighthouse duties. Performances are simply brilliant - three men irrevocably drawn deeper into tragedy as each decision, while seemingly sensible at the time, proves to be another step into the dark. Set on a bleak and remote island, the isolation proves fatal as the men have nobody to rely on except each other and as events unfold, that becomes increasingly difficult.It's powerful and believable... and sad. Perhaps more than anything else, because it could easily happen to any of us. It's a profound examination of the human character.Watch this one when you won't be distracted by anything.",

There is nothing to suggest that piracy or the smuggling of contraband or stolen loot ever took place as the movie's plot centralizes itself around. Why someone stealing gold from a ship need to use Flannan island as a staging point or incidentally a point of landing for a small vessel that would rendezvous likely hadn't bode well I'm sure with investigators at that time.

A take on much discussed incident - three keepers gone missing from Flannan Lighthouse in 1900. This is the first film inspired by that event. As the event was fully mysterious, you may think the filmmakers made a solution! But it's not like that, instead of showing a fictional mystery solution, they just showed the flow of event, without any prominent conclusion, and its the best part of the film making. The direction, visuals, camera works were classic, the hauntingly beautiful score & the brilliant tone make a brilliant eerie atmosphere. The acting of the starcast was top notch. The experienced Peter Mullan & Gerard Butler were treat to watch. Connor's debut was perfect. The debut screenplay of the actor turned writer duo was satisfying.A serious melodrama. The film opened many pathways but leave almost all the paths unchecked. I think that is intentional. The makers deserve praising for not showing any nonsense cinematic twist but a thought provoking transition of human mind out of greed. The film making was full of confidence & they knew what they are making. The violence on the screen was bearable & not very disturbing. From the start to end, the film stays composed. A fine melancholic piece of work which avoided all the chance of drowning & good enough not to be vanished from the mind. Watch it with a stable mind. You'll love it.",

It's based of a real event where Three lighthouse keepers went missing without a trace on a Scottish Island. This makes it a lot more interesting as your mind imagines possible scenarios of what happened to the men and which direction the film will take. I would also say what actual happens in the movie does not disappoint and may line up with the scenario you speculated.Definitely watch if you are Scottish or enjoy Scotland, I think it's good to support the films we produce as they are few and far between. None of the accents are too unintelligible for anyone who doesn't live here.The three leads all had really good performances. They all show the paranoia and decent into madness really well particularly Gerard Butler.This is a film about paranoia, speculation and decent into madness. It may seem slow at the start but don't let that stop you. This is a great watch and surprisingly brutal at times.",

An episode of Dr Who is the basis for the script for what is a simple tale of circumstance and the effects it has on the three protagonists.\nIt's neither funny nor happy, but it's a compelling watch as the lighthouse keepers' lives are turned upside down. Thomas (Mullan) is the senior, a thoughtful old hand with a wealth of experience, James (Butler) the practically minded family man who wants to see out his duty and return to his family. Donald (Swindells) is a rookie, slightly high spirited and undisciplined. When unexpected visitors call at the lighthouse, it changes all their lives and not for the better and the three me face greater challenges than the elements on the exposed island.\nIts dark intensity is is all encompassing and the three leads are excellent including the much maligned Butler, but it's Mullan as the craft old seadog that steals the show.",

Who would have thought if an isolated remote island could present a horror they had never expected before. Some oddities began to occur along with the problems that continued to approach these three people. Until it reaches a point where all must go and disappear, along with the moral burden they carry!Stunning acting from seasoned actors Tom Mullan and Gerard Butler also adds the power of the film which has this charming cinematography. Whacking emotion through a touch of cold psycho-drama, as well as spurring adrenaline with high tension in some scenes (typical thriller films), The Vanishing is an emotional play by combining uneasy feelings of anxiety and fear!",

Gerald Butler performs in a type of role that he should play more often rather than the cliched typecast work that he does such as 300. His character is strong yet vulnerable. He does not have all the answers. S\u00f8ren Malling and \u00d3lafur Darri \u00d3lafsson are quite wonderful as well. We are not given any sort of backstory about them or their gold. Are they bigger villains than the keepers? Their tattered rags and weather beaten faces tell a tale of a hard life, and like the keepers, they see their chance at a better life away from the see. The fact that one their children(an assumption on my part) is on board the boat make these guys as vulnerable as the keepers. James is seen telling his wife that if she cannot make ends meet, she needs to get an advance. This story is about all people on the edge. As we don't know how the Nordic sailors acquired their gold, we cannot blame them for wanting it back, although does that stretch to justifying violence. The keepers are trying to take their gold from them. If a thief steals your gold, can you use violence to get it back. Olafsson's character attacks James, the most able bodied of the group, yet does not kill him. Same with Donald. He is attacked, but not killed.The three keepers, when they come upon the lifeboat, classify it as boat. As they discuss their plan to escape with the gold, they did not conceive that the lifeboat came from a bigger boat, and that said boat would come looking for them on the island. So when the Nordics' boat appears, they are caught on the hop.James' decent into madness of PTSD is never clarified and seems at odds with the character's build up. He had a family. The director hints at mercury poisoning. Could a drop of mercury cause that in such a short period in time. If it's a type of PTSD, why kill Donald? That was a bit of mess.Lastly, the performance of Peter Mullen, as the experienced and grizzled old sailor and keeper, Thomas, is wonderful. In a cast of really good performances(as I said, Butler is superb), Mullen is excellent. Throughout the movie, you keep screaming at the other characters to follow Thomas' advice. He was right to open the chest, as not knowing what was inside would have caused him to be at a disadvantage as to the situation they would find themselves vis-a-vis the Nordics. Even if he had not opened it, after the third nordic tried attacked Donald, there was no way they were going to hand it over. It was either hold it until the authorities arrived or keep it for themselves. The radio not working was a let down for the film. It was too convenient.",

No bodies ever found....anything could have happened.After an incredible storm, they wake up in the morning to find a man and his mysterious box 'shipwrecked' on the island. Violence ensues...lots of it and that is when the story should have really taken off. That should have been the springboard to tension and paranoia. I should have been on the edge of my seat telling anybody who tried to interrupt my viewing to \"hold on a minute and I'll get back to you after the movie\". Instead, the story just meanders on and I was left wondering when 'something' was going to happen.It's difficult to gauge the acting. It was good but because the story was so lacking in any direction, it could have been great. This kind of plot requires that the storyline be 90% of the movie. It should make you want to see it again and again to see all the little details that you might have missed in the 1st, 2nd and etc, viewing. Instead I was left with a deep feeling of dissatisfaction.

Go back and let it all come back.Only shame is a powerful emotion. Shame can force us to hide, drink to numbness, lead us to live a heedless reckless chaotic life, choose terrible partners, stay in a rut. Shame can change a person to where they can't bear to live anymore because nothing's the same with them because of their choices. They see only one escape. Thomas understood this.James couldn't face what he did. What he became. How could he look at Mary, his kids as this different man?Was it the mercury we see the camera linger on a tad too long? Or was it simply owning up to his own actions and feeling shameful?I'm one of those few who diversify my viewings, my readings, and loved this story wildly.The best films haunt us.

As an extraordinary situation unfolds, they take extraordinary decisions and must then live with the terrible consequences.All the main characters are written and played convincingly. There's a depth and dark intensity to them that we seldom see in mainstream films. The rest - even the stunning Scottish scenery and the occasional violent outburst - is almost incidental, subtly under-played by skillful direction. What matters is what's going on inside their heads, and without resorting to crude storytelling through first person narrative voiceovers or flashbacks, the men's stories emerge in a way that explains their behaviours and gradually reveals their inner demons. If you can't fill in the gaps, you're not paying enough attention! Don't expect to be spoon-fed a simple or complete tale: this is a wonderfully evocative film that works by inspiring our imagination. How would we cope in the same position?

The true part stops there. I read about the real story during the show, since I was bored and because I wondered how the filmmakers had the information for this movie. Turns out they did not have the information for this movie, they just made up a story. The true account is that it was bad weather during a different time of the year, loss of supplies all leading to one of the men's log book having strange passages that pose something went wrong. The story could have had some Hollywood liberties taken to make it more entertaining but this one went overboard, literally. This movie goes down a path of piracy, lost treasure, murder and confusion. None of which happened according to any evidence of the true events. Plus, one of the guys is still sailing away at the end on a journey we are lead to believe he's pretty familiar with...except there were no trace of survivors?? That's what makes this whole story a mystery in the first place. Leaving a survivor is a big fact to change. Whatever, just call it something different and don't use the lure of being based real life events. It gets 3 stars because the three actors really deliver, I just couldn't care less about the story they fabricated. If this review saves some people a few hours that's what it's here for.",

I wish he would do more independent films and period pieces like this. I want to like the other stuff he does,  but not much he can work with from an acting standpoint. Stay with this one as it pays off, but most disturbing and violent. The older lighthouse keeper also gives quite a performance, but I'm not as familiar with his work.

The characters and their struggles aren't sufficiently fleshed out, and the pacing is also off which means there are times when it feels slow and like little of importance is happening.\n\nThat's not to say that it doesn't have its moments because it does, and Gerard Butler and Peter Mullan seem to be doing their best to keep things interesting, but overall, there's a feeling that its reach exceeds its grasp.",

This is something I would say is kinda like The Lighthouse (2019), but for people that don't want all the artsy and strangeness from that film. Is that a good thing or bad thing? It really depends on what kind of movies you like, but I enjoyed this one. The Vanishing follows three lighthouse keepers in 1900 the two veterans Thomas (Peter Mullan) and James (Gerard Butler) are joined by the young Donald (Connor Swindells). The three men get along, but one night after a crazy storm they find a crashed life boat with someone laying nearby with a chest. Thomas and James lower Donald down to get to it and the man comes back alive attacking Donald. Donald in self defense kills the man and brings the chest back up. The three men soon find that the chest includes bars of gold. They come up with a plan to bring it back, but of course then mysterious man that was guarding it originally has friends and they soon come to the island looking for their friend. The movie has a pretty good pacing. It's a bit slow, but it works. They're lighthouse workers. How exciting is that really right? The movie does a great job of building tension and eventually by the end of the film the gold changes one of the men for the worse and I think that that's a highlight of the film. It's not as smart as The Lighthouse, but it's not trying to be. This one was a good slow burn with a great payoff and one that I think some people may enjoy. Go into it blind and enjoy it (especially if you have Prime Video it's currently streaming on there).",

Certainly. Mild spoilers ahead.\n\nIt's an interesting story, one of those spooky historic little mysteries, that's behind the plot of this movie - it helds a hell of a lot more potential that this movie brought to the screen. The script is one the biggest flaws here, the pacing's next. There's a lot of long scenes centered around pieces of boring dialogues with little substance, but at the same time it feels like the filmmakers are extremely proud of their character writing, which they definitely shouldn't be. The story is interesting for about half of the movie, until the point when draggy pacing & unimpactful plot points just start to frustrate You. So those are the flaws, the biggest, anyways. Acting seems to be mostly on level, but, even though I feel like I can never rightly critisize actors performances, I have to say that Gerrard Butlers portrayal of a lighthouse keeper gone mad was pretty damn stale. Cinematography feels kinda shy, the beautiful setting is not used that much, for budgetary reasons, I imagine. \"The vanishing\" could've used a bit more violence as well, but there is a single pretty good little action scene. While the filmmakers seemingly tried really hard to create the grim, bleak atmosphere that's supposed to be there, they succeeded maybe halfway. It just doesn't get there really.\n\nOverall I would call this an underwhelming experience that leaves the viewer slightly angry because he knows it could've been better. My rating: 5/10.",

There are some nice shots of the island, a place that manages to be both picturesque and foreboding. All actors are decent, including Gerard Butler, Peter Mullan, and Connor Swindells as the lighthouse keepers.\n\nOn the other hand, the moments between can be weak and the exposition forced. The plot is predictable as it is a basic people-torn-apart-by-a-dark-secret-and/or-greed-story that doesn't do anything to set it apart from its predecessors, such as The Treasure of Sierra Madre and Shallow Grave. Of the three main actors, Mullan is the only one given the chance to shine. Filming was apparently on a budget and isn't lit the best. It doesn't help that this was filmed on cloudy days.\n\nThere's nothing really bad or great about this. It's just okay.

            "content": "The Vanishing (1.5 out of 5 stars). The Vanishing is a dull, boring, and pointless psychological thriller film about three men following their shift at a lighthouse. Based on real events about the mysterious disappearance of the lighthouse keepers in the 1900s. The plot follows Donald (Connor Swindells) a young adult and learning to be a keeper, James (Gerard Butler) who left his family behind on the main land, and Thomas (Peter Mullan) an older gentlemen who is struggling loss from his family. When they come across another stranger that washes up ashore with a chest. These three men try to debate on what they should do with the chest, if they should keep it a secret when they return to the main land or get rid of it. While being isolated, they begin to question their own insanity. I love the three cast members Gerard Butler, Connor Swindells, and Peter Mullan. But their performances are dull and boring. When they come across a few strangers and they get attacked. It just gets worse from there with their performances. The story was dull. The psychological part of these guys either trying to stay sane or their own personal greed can get in the way. There was not really much to the story. These characters were boring. The script was lacking in development even though it does set it up well with these three characters. The film does lack thrills and a sharp direction. It just feels like one long chore of sitting through the film. Overall, The Vanishing is a terrible film. The cast was boring with the characters. The plot was a waste for a psychological thriller. It lacked thrills or suspense to make this worthwhile to watch.",

I know this was only an IDEA of what may have happened all those years ago in the Flannen Isle Mystery, but let's just say, if this is anything close to the real deal, then DAMN. I applaud all three of the main actors in their roles, but the stand-out performance for me would have to be Gerard Butler as James.  His character arc was quite sad, but incredible to witness. I know it's probably WAY too early to say this, but get this man some awards for this movie (which he also happened to produce)! He's sure come a long way since I first saw him, which I proudly admit was in The Phantom of the Opera (2004). The soundtrack was so eerie and unique, which really fit with the mysterious and haunting vibe of the movie's setting. There was some fantastic cinematography with the beautiful Scottish setting and great lingering shots as well! Now I will say the movie's introductory paragraph about how the three keepers (James, Thomas, & Donald) disappeared without a trace, DID take away from the shock factor of the ending for me, which also felt to be a tad abrupt in my eyes. I don't know if anyone else felt this way while watching the movie so right now I'll say that was just me. But in the end it was a fantastic movie! I def. recommend it for anyone looking for a good slow-burn thriller with memorable performances and an overall unpredictable storyline!",
