            "content": "\"La Strada\" established Federico Fellini as one of the best Italian directors of his generation. Working with his usual collaborator, Tulio Pinelli, the master created a human story that is still, as fresh today, as when it opened. The fantastic musical score by Nino Rota gives the film an elegance that transcend the poor background of the people one sees in the movie. Also, the crisp black and white photography by Otelo Martelli enhances our enjoyment.This could be considered Fellini's first masterpiece. His previous work was, of course, excellent, but with \"La Strada\", he proved he had an amazing understanding of the characters he presents to us. It is almost as though, he had known these people all his life and just decided to incorporate them in a movie. This is a film that showed an Italy that had suffered a defeat during WWII. Italy was struggling to heal itself from the horrible times it had lived during the conflict and what the director and his collaborators show us is an impoverished country trying to cope with the new reality. La Strada\" is a film about the suffering and hard times the citizens had gone through, but also shows hope in an uncertain future.Zampano, the brutish street performer, was a man that showed no redeeming qualities. He returned to the beach shack where Rosa's mother and siblings live to tell them about her death. Watching the young and innocent Gelsomina, he figures he has found a substitute for the act. Zampano is a misogynistic man who only cares about his pleasure, not paying any attention to the needs of the young woman who is not street wise.The film, in a way, is Fellini's type of 'road movie' because we are taken along the byways of the country, before the construction of the super highways, to witness Zampano as he practices his trade from town to town. Gelsomina soon catches on, and in her heart she believes Zampano is, in his own way, the man for her. Unfortunately, Zampano leaves Gelsomina whenever a new woman strikes his fancy. He uses Gelsomina as a slave.When they meet Il Matto, the good natured tight wire artist, Zampano notices how Gelsomina responds to this kind soul. Il Matto, in spite of what he feels about Zampano, advises Gelsomina to stay with him. A fatal judgment it proves to be. Tragedy arrives when Zampano and Gelsomina run into Il Matto on the road. This incident unravels Zampano as he begins a spiral descent into hell because his conscience doesn't let him have peace, and in turn, Gelsomina, makes sure to let him know she knows the immensity of what he has done.Zampano in abandoning Gelsomina thinks he has solved all his problems, but a few years later he comes across a young woman who is humming the song that Gelsomina used to sing. In fact, we learn what happened to the sweet girl, and we are shocked and saddened. Zampano, who seems to be a man without any feeling, upon learning this walks away, but his guilt gets the best of him and we watch him as he breaks down as the film comes to an end.Anthony Quinn had one of the best moments of his long and distinguished career with Zampano. His understanding of this cruel man makes the film work the way it does. Mr. Quinn's interpretation of the street performer is real and we can see what kind of man he really is. Our perception of this man, who has led us to believe he has a heart of stone changes at the end when we see his breakdown.Giulietta Masina is perfect as Gelsomina. This actress, married to Mr. Fellini, had an uncanny way of transforming herself into the young and naive woman and makes her come alive. Gelsomina personifies all the best qualities any person could aspire to have. It comes naturally for her to be good; Gelsomina doesn't have malice and is a grown up child in many ways.Richard Basehart has some good moments in the film as Il Matto. In fact, Fellini elicited a great performance from this actor, who took a big gamble accepting the challenge that his character demanded from him. Mr. Basehart proved he was an extraordinary actor and it shows in this film.\"La Strada\" is a film that will live forever thanks to the man who had the vision to bring it to the screen: Federico Fellini!",

            "content": "A man of uncommon strength, who lives on the road and makes his living as an entertainer performing feats of strength, but who masks the emptiness of his life with a perpetual show of bravura, is the focal point of `La Strada,' directed by Federico Fellini and written by Fellini and Tullio Pinelli.  It's the story of Zampano (Anthony Quinn), who travels from town to town, eking out a meager living by passing the hat after each performance, which consists mainly of wrapping a quarter-inch chain made of iron around his chest, then breaking it by expanding his lungs.  In his endeavors he is assisted by Gelsomina (Giulietta Masina), a simple-minded young woman who is devoted to this selfish man endowed with little more intelligence than she.  The tragedy of Zampano is that while he seeks fulfillment in meaningless carnal pursuits and the hollow acclaim of strangers, the happiness that eludes him is at hand; but his own self-deception prevents him from recognizing what a treasure he already has in Gelsomina. \tOne of Fellini's earliest films, there is a straightforward, almost simplistic richness to his style, both visually and narratively, that is devoid of the surreal atmosphere with which he invests his later projects. Still, the mood he creates is mesmerizing, aided to a great extent by the haunting theme and score by Nino Rota.  It is a story that gradually draws the viewer in through the sympathy evoked by the gentle innocence of Gelsomina, whose purity of spirit is seemingly in such stark contrast to that of Zampano.  Watching her respond to his unthinking brutality of her with unadulterated kindness, time after time, is heartrending; and in the end, when Zampano ultimately secures our sympathies as well, it seems almost contradictory, though contextually just. \tAs Zampano, Anthony Quinn gives what is arguably one of the best performances of his career; with depth and nuance, he creates the epitome of the brutal simpleton, a man whose lack of wit forces him to exist by the most basic of instincts.  And Quinn conveys it all so perfectly, both physically and emotionally; it is an inspired, memorable performance.  But without question, the true heart of the film is provided by the wondrous Giulietta Masina.  What a superb, unforgettable performance; everything about her is totally engaging, beginning with the supple roundness of her face, which accentuates her expressive eyes and winning smile.  Her Gelsomina is so lithe, her presence so angelic, that at times it seems as if she is about to float up off the screen.  She conveys such compassion and vulnerability, such warmth of being, that it becomes impossible not to lose your heart to her.  It is quite simply an irresistible, truly heartwarming performance.  Also, in an exceptionally effective supporting role, is Richard Basehart, as Il `Matto,' the `Fool.'  A tightrope walker by trade, the Fool is the antithesis of Zampano, a lighthearted soul who befriends Gelsomina and becomes her voice of hope and logic, while at the same time manifesting a taunting, challenging and unwelcomed presence to Zampano. Ironically, it is the Fool who becomes the catalyst for the tragedies that ultimately befall Gelsomina, and finally Zampano. \tThe supporting cast includes Aldo Silvani (Il Signor Giraffa), Marcella Rovere (The Widow) and Livia Venturini (The Sister).  An earthy, thought-provoking film, `La Strada' is one that will linger on sweetly in your mind's eye; the images and impressions it creates may, with time, dissolve-- but the essence of it will remain with you always.  For once Fellini has touched you, it is forever.  I rate this one 10/10.",

            "review_title": "Often Sad, Sometimes Surreal, Always Human",
            "content": "Fellini's \"La Strada\" is memorable, atmospheric, entertaining, thoughtful, and many other things. It is often sad, not even so much because of the things that happen, but simply for what it reveals about the human condition. It is sometimes surreal, not in a bizarre visual sense, but in the unexpected combinations of emotions that it sometimes evokes. And it is always human, commenting on individuals and humanity as a whole with a keen eye and with cinematic skill.The three main characters make an odd and interesting mix of personalities. Anthony Quinn gives plenty of life to Zampano, who is hard to like, but hard not to have compassion for. Fellini's repeated filmings of Zampano's chain act bring out the pitiable side of his character even more so than the dramatic scenes do.Giulietta Masina gives a rather stylized performance as Gelsomina, at times bearing a surprising resemblance to comics such as Harpo Marx or even Harry Langdon. Yet she is completely engaging and sympathetic, and she creates a memorable character. Richard Basehart likewise manages to make The 'Fool' an idiosyncratic, rather annoying, but again sympathetic character.Fellini's approach, of course, adds much to the characters and to the story. Some of the vignettes, such as the wedding banquet sequence and the convent sequence, would stand up very well on their own with just a minimum of outside context. The camera is often used in subtle ways to bring out the symbolism or significance of the scene.Nino Rota's music is also an essential part of making \"La Strada\" what it is, at times establishing an atmosphere all by itself. (And, while it is completely extraneous to an appreciation of \"La Strada\", there are moments when it is hard not to be reminded of Rota's score for \"The Godfather\".) Probably the only real weakness of the movie is the dubbing, which is too noticeable not to become distracting at times.Finally, the movie is a worthy classic not least because Fellini, his cast, and his crew all work together to turn the lives of some very ordinary human beings into a worthwhile and sympathetic look at humanity.",

            "content": "La Strada brings two souls together to tell a story that ultimately displays humanity's finer aspects. The title gives a clue to the meaning of Fellini's masterpiece: The Way. The brute, Zampano, buys the urchin-like Gelsomina to be his traveling companion in his one-man carnival act. He is physically and emotionally cruel to her. Her longing to love and be loved, and her child-like, yet acute perception of life, and desire to live it, despite hardships, makes her the perfect complement to the selfish and despicable Zampano. Their unification affects each other. However, although Zampano's harshness adversely effects Gelsomina's life, it is her influence that will eventually, and more significantly, change him. This may sound like the familiar Beauty and the Beast fairy tale, but it is more than a love story. It is about love, but it isn't until the very end of the film that we realize it. More than love, it is about a man who gains insight and awareness because of love. It is his finale transformation that demonstrates both the frailty and vitality of the human condition. It overpoweringly suggests that the individual, no matter how depraved, is able to spiritually evolve. Every frame and scene in this masterpiece has purpose and meaning.",

            "review_title": "A Potpourri of Vestiges Review: Fellini the Maestro! Zampano the Brute!",
            "content": "La Strada is the third Fellini movie that I have delighted myself with\u2014the other two being Otto e Mezzo and La Dolce Vita\u2014and coincidentally the least Felliniesque of the three, and I dare say, the simplest to interpret. And precisely that's the reason I have chosen it to begin of my eulogy on Fellini's lifelong masterful works. Fellini's staunch critics had audaciously deemed him narcissistic and his singular works self-indulgent and self-gratifying. Their myopic vision made them overlook the fact that narcissism and solipsism are the very virtues that give form to art and aesthetics. A true artist uses these traits to isolate himself from the worldly pursuits so that he can create a connection with the divine and attain a sense of enlightenment. He then pours his heart out and offers it selflessly in form of his art. Thus, the artist's apparent self-indulgence is actually a means to share his hard earned and newly acquired knowledge, gratis with the rest of the world. Fellini too like any true artist gave his audience what he thought they deserved: a product of his intellect and vision with the sole motive of titillating their senses. La Strada is Fellini's improvisation on the epic theme of a beast and a beauty as depicted in the 1740 fairy tale 'Beauty and the Beast' and later on glorified by Victor Hugo's literary marvel 'The Hunchback of Notre-Dame'. What makes Fellini's rendition different is that even though Zampano perfectly fits into the caricature of a beast, Gelsomina falls short of the literary definition of a beauty. However, what Gelsomina lacks in pulchritude is more than made up by her celestial charm and naive disposition. These conflicting traits give Gelsomina an irresistible persona that makes her inexplicably amicable and desirable. Zampano on the contrary does not have a single trait that is likable and offers a great contrast to Gelsomina's innocuous self.Zampano is a traveling entertainer who earns a living by performing street acts that demand extreme physical strength. Gelsomina's poor old mother sells her to brutish Zampano for a sum of 10,000 lire as a replacement for her dead daughter Rosa. Zampano ill treats Gelsomina, and despite her compliance and willingness to learn, uses brute force to teach her. She naively acquiesces even to Zampano's sexual advances. Zampano teaches her to jest and dance as well as to play drum and trumpet. One day when she finds him drunk after a night of debauchery, she decides to leave him in order to explore other possibilities. En route, she meets Il Mato\u2014an equilibrist with a great sense of humor. Zampano manages to locate her and forcibly takes her back. Zampano joins the same circus group that Il Matto is a part of. Soon fate presents Gelsomina with an opportunity to choose between Zampano and Il Matto. La Strada goes beyond revealing Gelsomina's choice and its consequences. It accentuates that even the most bestial of the souls has a latent goodness that makes him capable of love and worthy of being loved. La Strada demonstrates that the human emotions defy reason and are driven by instinct.Anthony Quinn arguably gives the best performance of his life as the stone cold Zampano. He effortlessly conjures up his brutish alter ego and makes him appear absolutely abominable to the viewer. As Zampano, Quinn manages to portray a caricature that has become the epitome of callous ruthlessness in cinema. Federico Fellini's wife, Giulietta Masina perfectly fits into the sketch of Gelsomina. With the portrayal of Gelsomina, Masina proves her worth as an actress. Her inspired portrayal absolves Fellini from the suspicion that her casting was inspired by motives other than talent. As Gelsomina, she not only offers a striking contrast to Quinn's part, but also manages to create a special place in the movie. In fact, by the end it becomes quite obvious that La Strada belongs to her more than Quinn or, I dare say, Fellini. In the initial few minutes, Masina looks a bit over-aged for Gelsomina's part, but she soon enchants everyone with her peculiar charm and the rest becomes completely immaterial. The cinematography of the movie is highly picturesque and presents the viewer with scenes that get etched permanently in the memory. Nino Rota's mellifluous music gives the movie a lyrical touch. Overall, La Strada is a moving experience for aficionados and masses alike. It is a great opportunity for the students and lovers of cinema to get acquainted with Fellini's oeuvre before venturing into his more personal works like Otto e Mezzo, La Dolce Vita, Amarcord and Satyricon. 9/10http://www.apotpourriofvestiges.com/",

He asked for the projection to be interrupted in more than one occasion. He was disturbed, confused. Maybe it was the simplicity, the total lack of artifice. Let's remember Fellini shot it in the immediate post-war Italy with no means whatsoever and here it was, a masterpiece changing the world of cinema pushing us to a reality that was as pungent as it was poetic. The heartbreaking story of Gelsomina - an extraordinary Giulietta Masina - and Zampano - a spectacular prime Anthony Quinn who plays his humanoid with shattering truth - went to become a global sensation and an Oscar winner. Apparently, after the film was over, Cecil B de Mille got up and left the room without saying a word.",

Basehart and Quinn under Fellini's skillful direction add a chemistry to Masina's portrayal of innocence that is incredible.  I would argue this is Fellini's best film. Everything works.  It is so full of little things, from the farm folk hired as extras to the rubber boots worn by Quinn striding into the ring to do his corny strongman act.  Fellini nearly drove Masina crazy during the filming-- he wouldn't let her bath or wash her hair for weeks on end-- but, the end result speaks for itself.  There are some excellent comments on this film elsewhere in this section.  I suggest you read them.  I can only say, this is one of the great films.",

            "content": "\"La Strada\" is Fellini's poignant drama about a simple, na\u00efve young women Gelsomina (Giulietta Masina) who is 'sold' by her mother to be the consort/assistant of Zampan\u00f2, a cruel, itinerant street performer (Anthony Quinn). The film follows the two as they travel though post-war Italy performing Zampan\u00f2's shabby one-man show for handouts. While working in a run-down circus, they encounter \"Il Matto\" (Richard Basehart), a talented performer who takes an immediate dislike to Zampan\u00f2 and taunts the quick-tempered strongman at every opportunity. Gelsomina is torn between her aversion to the harsh, thoughtless Zampan\u00f2 and a feeling of duty toward him, which she begins to believe is her purpose in life. As the sweet, fragile Gelsomina, Giulietta Masina is fascinating to watch. She has limited dialogue and much of her story is told in her face, which ranges from almost expressionless vacuity to great joy to profound sadness, as she struggles to get along with her brutish companion. Quinn and Basehart, playing contrasting, antagonistic characters, are also excellent. Winner of the first Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film. Best seen in the original Italian, with subtitles if necessary.",

            "content": "It is the early sixties in Annapolis, Maryland. Although a Third Class Petty Officer in the Navy, I am still in my teens & have never sampled the cinema except for what Hollywood has had to offer. I have just stumbled out of a theater & I am stunned yet aware that I have just witnessed a work of art that was devoid of compromise. That work was La Strada, a cinematic creation directed by Federico Fellini. I have viewed this film several times since but it never pales & each time I take away something new. In this post I'll concentrate on the main characters & some of the cast.Anthony Quinn was perfect for the role of Zampano, the grubby strongman performer touring the villages & countryside of post-WW2 Italy. No other actor of the day could have possibly brought what Quinn brings to the role. There may have been some European actor who would not have shamed himself in the part, but I can't think of who it might have been & certainly no actor known by Hollywood could have done so well as Quinn. One has to resort to other eras & reach far into the imagination to attempt such speculation. If Wallace or Noah Beery, sr. could have managed a not too corrupted Italian persona; perhaps. If Gilbert Roland had lifted weights & taken supplements for a year; maybe. Victor McLaglen could never have passed for Italian \u0096 don't laugh \u0096 he had the rugged looks & the physique. Ricardo Montalban? Too handsome. Ditto, Victor Mature. Mitchum was way too 'American.' Nehemiah Persoff, Eli Wallach, Telly Savalas, Rod Steiger, Karl Malden, even Van Heflin, all considered, all rejected. Brando might have been credible. One remembers \"A Streetcar Named Desire\" & \"On the Waterfront\" & thinks: Possibly. But Quinn plays the role as if it was what he was put on earth to do.Quinn's Zampano is earthily callous yet the viewer senses vulnerability buried deep within the character. Among other facets his perfect performance presents to the viewer is a faintly perceived inkling of past disappointments, of indirectly inferred reasons that Zampano is cruel & insensitive. Quinn's consummate technique paints the broad picture of a lout yet the viewer is able to pull a slender thread of sympathy from his character & that sympathy is necessary for the end of the movie. To be very bad & to still be likable, if only barely, is produced by Quinn as if it were a gift to the viewer. It is acting on the highest possible plane.Giulietta Masina plays Gelsomina, a tattered urchin Zampano purchases from her poverty-bested mother. Here too, the viewer witnesses genius of casting. Masina's face is one of Fellini's main canvases in the film. It mugs, it displays pride, love & resignation in fleeting cascades of expression, sometimes all within a second. Even without the plasticity of her face her body alone would be enough to write volumes for the viewer. It gambols, prances, pratfalls & cunningly sneaks, sometimes at breakneck speed though the viewer's eye is never allowed to blur these perceptions despite the rapidity of much of the execution.Richard Basehart plays the Fool, foil to Quinn's brute. Whereas Quinn's act subsists on feats of strength, Basehart's character is all about finesse: juggling, acrobatics & tightrope-walking. Zampano is awkward on those occasions that he attempts real affection toward Gelsomina. The Fool is light strokes of joviality; joking & flirting is his natural mode. Zampano's voice is gruff and in the baritone range; Basehart's lines are delivered high-pitched, with a lilting modulation. However, just as Zampano has an almost hidden vein of sensitivity, Basehart imbues his lighthearted portrayal with a close to imperceptible strand of hardness.The vehicle of the plot is a journey, but a journey with no particular physical destination. In a work such as \"Huckleberry Finn\" Twain provides a direction(down-river with the current). Here the characters appear to wander aimlessly from place to place, seemingly interacting by chance with whoever they meet & somehow this very lack of goal helps to give the piece a lifelike aura of randomness. The viewer becomes unaware of watching a film. Like all truly great works of art, technique never intrudes & the viewer could be a fly on the wall.This lack of artificiality allows the viewer to be fully immersed in the unfolding events. The landscape is the blasted Italian environment just after WW2 & is symbolic of the work's bleak message. The camera rolls on weeds, shacks, broken concrete, poorly maintained roadways, dry, desolate hinterlands & famine-ridden villages. There is no looking away allowed, the viewer is made to see, forced to behold stark realities.It is impossible to say exactly what makes this film a masterpiece. By a mysterious & perhaps lucky combination of ingredients it propels itself into the highest circle of cinema. The end is emotionally wrenching & I would venture that few are able to leave it as I did long ago in Annapolis without a sense of having been deeply moved.",

            "content": "I've gotta admit that I unfairly gave this film a poor review a while back. When I first saw the film, I didn't like it and was overwhelmed by the depressing aspects of the movie. BUT, when I just saw it again, I thought it was a masterfully made film! The film begins with Anthony Quinn buying a lady (Giulietta Masina) from her poor mother! Quinn (who is dubbed throughout the film) plays a traveling strongman and he needs a woman to be his assistant. There are two problems with this. First, Masina plays a slow-witted lady who isn't much of a cook, so her value to Quinn seems minimal at first. Second, Quinn is a selfish, boorish and violent man who mistreats his assistant throughout the film--both verbally and physically. However, poor little Masina is like a beaten dog. Once she tries to leave him but he soon catches her and now she has finally given up and resigns herself to her wretched life. The only positive in her life is that although she is pretty slow, she has some natural comic talent and is actually quite a help to Quinn--though he is such a brute he doesn't recognize it. There is a lot more to the film than this--including an interesting character played by Richard Basehart (also dubbed--with a really freaky voice), but I don't want to spoil the film by saying more.Overall, despite American actors Quinn and Basehart being in the film, the standout star is Masina. Ms. Masina was the real-life Mrs. Fellini and she was absolutely amazing as the poor lady, Gelsomina. Rarely, if ever, have I seen an actor done so much with their facial expressions and body language. While NOT an attractive woman, she is able to make you laugh at times and charm you while at other times, she shows such tragedy and pain as well. A truly brilliant job of acting and her hubby did a great job of eliciting the performance and setting the mood. While this is NOT a feel-good film, it is brilliant and well worth seeing.

The viewer is overflowed with emotion because the film itself focuses on human emotion, and is a pure amusement to watch because of the many symbols. When Zampano tries to steal a silver heart from the church and Gelsomina pleads with him not to, we can only think of the cold silver heart, his sad action of trying to \"steal\" such an emotion as \"love\", Gelsomina's soft nature - this film overflows with such subtleties, but such subtleties! so impactful in conveying emotion..\nGelsomina's faith to Zampano is heartwrenching - she is presented with opportunities to leave Zampano, such as leaving to the nunnery or joining the circus, but she declines all. This fidelity builds up, only to have.. well, let's just say that Fellini is especially skillful in drawing your sympathy and then channeling for it in a single scene.. he knows how to focus and concentrate your emotion, I felt sort of violated after watching the film, since I rarely cry for movies! Also, if the symbolism does not stir a reader to interest, the amazing cinematography will. The tightrope act atop the city buildings, the motorbike rides, the Christ ceremony-This movie is unpredictable and is interesting to watch, since it keeps the mind afloat with the different scenes which are packed with symbols and metaphors, wonderful puzzles to decipher. Since Fellini does not present it straight-forwardly, and rather wraps meaning in several layers of symbols, uncovering the truth becomes fulfilling for the viewer.The way Fellini develops his characters is unforgettable. We feel their demise, but urge to see and understand more. I feel only Fellini can accomplish such a remarkable quality. And in case you didn't get the gist of my rating (and my ranting).. 4 stars.

It really adds to the film's emotion and as is the case with the master's other scores, it is beautiful, haunting and sticks in the mind for a long while after.The story is well-written and touching. Some of it may be bizarre and sentimental with the concept and love story, but it is also very touching with a dream like quality to it. Fellini also throws in some messages and symbols which are incorporated quite nicely I think.The script I have no qualms with. Emotionally it resonated with me, and it gave real credibility to the characters. Speaking of the characters, all are very credible especially Gelsomina.The acting is wonderful. Guilietta Masina is amazing as Gelsomina, it is altogether a sympathetic and touching performance. Anthony Quinn is also memorable as Zampano, and to me Richard Basehart gives one of his better performances as he is amusing without jarring.All in all, probably my least favourite of the Fellinis I've seen so far, but I still loved it. It is a very beautiful film and well worth seeing. 9/10 Bethany Cox",

            "content": "LA STRADA is a perfect Christian fable about things like love and loneliness, sin and redemption, in which the characters represent  spiritual and moral concepts but in which the symbolism isn't either hammered over our heads or sprinkled gratuitously like cultural confetti. It is a film so fundamentally universal and immediate in appeal that it captures the imagination and heart of every viewer.  I've never heard of anyone hating LA STRADA, not really.There are things that especially move me, for example, the repeated backward tracking motions of the camera to represent abandonment: when Gelsomina leaves home with Zampano' and waves goodbye to family,when she and Zampano' leave the convent they have spent the night in, when Zampano' leaves behind the crazed Gelsomina (and in an untypically human gesture, her beloved trumpet as a gift), when Fellini's camera pulls back in the by-now-ironic motion that is the film's last shot and in which the abandoner becomes the abandoned. I love the way Il Matto, a false tear painted on his face, laughs at the farcical face of Gelsomina on the crowd during their first encounter at the fair. I love it when Gelsomina, reminded of home,  runs ecstatically to the ocean.  I love that emotional scene in which Zampano' accidentally kills Il Matto after an impromptu beating.  Il Matto's watch stops telling time as he falls shaking and clutching the earth. I love the poignant scene in the convent where Gelsomina seems part of a peaceful idyll, ruined by Zampano's stealing.  I like those roadside traveling scenes with glimpses of barren trees and landscape against the sound of a sputtering motorcycle-vehicle or the haunting music of Nino Rota.I suppose I like everything about LA STRADA and have done so for a half-century.  I cannot even begin to talk about the greatness of Giulietta Masina, Anthony Quinn, and Richard Basehart.  If you love movies and know movies, this film becomes part of you and you find it difficult to do without it for long.  I can't think of higher praise.",

He shows animal-like instincts rarely seen on the screen.Giulietta Masina's performance as the simpleton is picture-perfect. She utterly evokes sympathy as a simpleton beyond belief. She may be simple but she is tragically looking for love to a strongman who thinks of it as nothing to hurt her in any way that he can.Richard Basehart, in an engaging performance, plays the fool of the circus. Yet, is he really this?The sadness seen on Masina's face is unbelievable. She cries out for compassion and for survival which fate has decided shall not be hers.Scenes of the tormented Quinn are beyond the realm of human understanding. When he returns after a year's absence only to learn of Masina's fate, he is wrought with destruction as a totally broken man.In 1954 the Motion Picture Academy would not allow actors in foreign films to be nominated in Acting categories. Had this been permitted, both Quinn and Masina would have certainly won Oscars.The film established Federica Fellini, Masina's husband, as a master director.A totally powerful film-never to be forgotten.",

            "content": "Gelsomina lives a quiet life with her mother and three sisters. However, this sheltered existence is shattered when a travelling showman, Zampano, pays her mother so that Gelsomina will travel with and work for him. She is initially a reluctant participant in his line of work but soon tries to make the most of it, even learning some new skills. However, she has to contend with his brutish, unfeeling behaviour.Superb, emotional movie, written and directed by Federico Fellini. Quite a harrowing journey as Fellini here is an emotional sadist, heaping torment on the most innocent of souls. He toys with the audience, offering glimmers of hope and a promise of a better turn of events, only to dash these hopes soon thereafter.A similar theme to The Nights of Cabiria, released three years later, as we have an incredibly engaging and likable leading character trying to find something positive in a cynical, uncaring world. As with The Nights of Cabiria, while Fellini's plot and direction are brilliant, the movie is made by Giuletta Masina (his wife, incidentally). She is perfect as Gelsomina, mixing Chaplinesque physical comedy with heartbreaking innocence and forlornness. One cannot help but be engaging by her character and empathise with her plight. With her character sucking you into the narrative, you are at the mercy of Fellini's incredibly moving plot.Superb movie, Fellini's finest.",

Brute Zampano (Anthony Quinn) is a cruel , coarse , strong-man who shows his vigour by breaking a chain wrapped around his chest . They tour on the road (\"la Strada\") , along the countryside where they perform in village squares and she helps him as a drummer during his shows and passing the hat for whatever the regularly small crowd is prepared to give . They join a small traveling circus where eventually meet up with a gentle acrobat (Richard Basehart) and the unexpected happenings go wrong .Sensitive and agreeable film film packs intense drama , emotion , good feeling and tragedy . The picture is , by turns , strong and amusing . Here Fellini demonstrates a real sensibility to the underprivileged of the world and his belief in spiritual redemption . Fellini's fantasy ostensibly elucidates the inner life of a poor and normally mistreated woman . The flick contains a highly symbolic internal logic , enjoyable imagery and bizarre , abstract plot peppered with risqu\u00e9 humor . Here Fellini uses the unfortunate story of a distressed woman delivering over her life to create a good and often wild film . The film relies heavily on the peculiar relationship between Gelsomina and Zampano , but it doesn't make boring but interesting ; as he doesn't treat her well and when she tries to run away , he beats her . Magnificent interpretations all around . Trio protagonist is frankly awesome . Nice performance by Giulietta Massina as the waif sold by her very poor mother and she feels like going with him , but he puts confusion in her mind and finally falls in love with him despite his abuse . Excellent Anthony Quinn as the traveling , itinerant showman , Zampano exhibits feats of strength and meanwhile he ill-treats her . Anthony Quinn was working on a film with Giulietta Masina when she introduced him to her husband , Federico who was immediately convinced that the Mexican actor would make the perfect Zampano the strongman in his new film , which was to become La Strada (1954), and implored him to accept the character . And sympathetic acting by Richard Basehart as a tight-rope walker \"The Fool\", a funambulist who convinces Gelsomina to question her choices . Well produced by two greatest Italian producers , Dino De Laurentiis and Carlo Ponti , who originally wanted Silvana Mangano , Dino's wife , and Burt Lancaster as the leads . However , at the beginning Federico Fellini had an extraordinarily difficult time finding producers who were willing to back the film and he began shooting the film before any financial backers had officially signed on .The motion picture was masterfully directed by Federico Fellini , he admitted that he each of the principal characters in the film represented the elements . Zampano represented the Earth , Gelsomina represented water, and the Fool represented air . It won the first ever Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film (1956) and N.Y Critics Award to Foreign Film (56) . Fellini who inspired the word \"Felliniesque\" was one of the best Italian filmmakers/writers . He frequently cast Marcello Mastroianni and Giulietta Masina and Score by Nino Rota . His best works include dreams like imagery and nostalgia . He made Italian classics , such as : \u00a88 and 1/2\u00a8, \u00a8Roma\u00a8, \u00a8Satyricon\u00a8, \u00a8I Vitellone\u00a8 , \u00a8La Dolce Vita\u00a8 , \u00a8The clowns\u00a8, \u00a8Casanova\u00a8, \u00a8And the ship sails on\u00a8, \"City of Women\" , \"Orchestra Rehearsal\" and directed his spouse Giulietta in various films such as : \u00a8The white sheik\u00a8 , \u00a8Il Bidone\u00a8, \u00a8Juliet of the Spirits\u00a8, \"The Nights of Cabiria\" \u00a8Ginger and Fred\u00a8 and including some auto-biographic elements , especially in \u00a8Amarcord\u00a8 (1973) , though he denied his film is autobiographical , but agreed that there are similarities with his own childhood .",

            "content": "La Strada aka The Road is one of the greatest films of what is perhaps the best decade in cinematic history - the 1950's. Fellini is on top form and this is the best of his many collaborations with his wife of 50 years Giulietta Masina.Legend has it that Fellini saw a woman on Via Veneto who looked like an artichoke. That is what inspired the character of Gelsomina, a simpleton with a face that looks like an artichoke. Gelsomina is bought from her poor parents by circus strongman Zampato, played by Anthony Quinn. He takes her on the road and teaches her to become part of his act. In the process, he also rapes her, beats her and frequently insults her. She, on the other hand, sort of falls in love (or believes she does) with him. Both actors give tour-de-force performances but Masina is truly one of the greatest actresses ever and her performance is the closest that I can think of to what is called Chaplinesque.La Strada is a tragic love story and of course we know it can never have a happy ending. The best part of an artichoke is its heart, and that is what Gelsomina is. Zampato's calling card is that he can break iron chains tied around his chest/heart. Two such different personalities can never really love each other. There is a lot of symbolism in this film, but even viewed as a simple love story it is touching and heartfelt. The music is beautiful, the subtitling superb and the dialogue is great.Viewers who like this film should certainly explore a later Fellini - Massina collaboration Le Notti di Cabiria.",

            "content": "La Strada can sometimes come across as similar to the Hollywood films made in the 1950s, but for the most part, is a unique and beautiful story. It concerns a young woman, Gelsomina, being given to traveling \"artist\" Zampano by her poor mother in exchange for money. Zampano makes his money by traveling around Italy, putting on a strong-man show for crowds. Gelsomina has dreams of becoming an artist as well, and therefore was more than happy to go with Zampano, but Gelsomina quickly realises that Zampano is nothing more than a drunkard and a brute, with eating, sleeping and sex being the only things he cares for.The character of Gelsomina, played by Giulietta Masina, is the highlight of the film. With a face like no other, it exudes a certain beauty but is also very odd, with a definite quirkiness to it \u0085\"like an artichoke\". Masina is excellent as expressing emotions with nothing more than a look, and it is because of this that the film stands strong. The story itself is simple, but with Gelsomina being such a romantic at heart, she is constantly searching for love and an understanding of a world she doesn't know, being such a sheltered loner when living with her mother and four younger sisters.Zampano, the traveling strong-man, follows the basic of human instincts, irrespective of their bearing on others, namely Gelsomina. Anthony Quinn gives the character a great ignorance, Zampano being, for the most part, oblivious to the impact his actions have, only wanting to be able to earn money to eat and drink wine, and sleep with women. It is not until Zampano and Gelsomina (Gelsomina having become Zampano's sidekick in his traveling show) take on a position as part of a circus in town, and Gelsomina meets an acrobat clown, credited in the film as Il Matto \u0096 The Fool. She falls for his happy and carefree nature, exampled when he teases Zampano whilst he is trying to do his show. Zampano soon despises the Fool, and becomes jealous of the friendship forming between Gelsomina and the clown. This is where Zampano begins to show real emotion, and although he doesn't deal with the situation in the most appropriate way, it is the beginning of his life experience that changes him forever.The film is gorgeous, with some memorable characters, namely Gelsomina. It doesn't end on a happy note, but you are still left satisfied with the story told, especially the lesson taught to Zampano, although it was all too late for him, and it is not certain that he learned from the experience. Masina is an absolute delight to watch, holding you captive with her face alone, beaming with love. The film is not for those looking for Hollywood drama and action, but for anyone who knows how it feels to be confused and in need of understanding about life's ways.",

One day he buys a new member for his act, Gelsomina, a young and slightly retarded innocent woman. Traveling around the country and performing acts - Zampano is breaking the chains from his chest while Gelsomina is entertaining the audience dressed as a clown - the two of them come closer...\"The Road\", winner of an Oscar for best foreign language film, is a real full blood masterpiece and in my opinion Federico Fellini's best achievement. If you are on the lookout for a spectacular movie with epic proportions and deep truths about life, then don't look here, or better said you will get to see the deepest truths about life through the most simple and child like elements and symbols, such as when Gelsomina raises her hand on the street to impersonate a branch of a tree. It's just the way this film is. And yet, he is so brilliant. Giulietta Masina is simply fantastic as the innocent ( and slightly retarded ) Gelsomina that does almost everything wrong and Anthony Quinn is also great as the grumpy Zampano who discovers his real emotions for her only at the end on the beach, when everything is too late.------------ The tragic but uplifting story, presented in a form of a road movie, serves nothing more than as a vehicle for the 2 main characters to meet each other. Extremely touching and emotional, and always presented on a subtle base, while offering some bitter moments too ( Gelsomina trying to hide her tears from the nuns when she is leaving the church with Zampano who tried to rob the interior ). All completely spontaneous and magical. I could go on and on about how great \"The Road\" is, but I won't. Words do not do this film justice. You have to see it for yourself and you won't be disappointed. It's one of the most beautiful films of the 50s and Fellini achieved it with simple, raw, down to Earth elements from everyday life.Grade: 10/10",

Even more significant are the stellar performances of the three leads, the skill and artistry of Fellini's direction, the stark black and white cinematography of Martelli and Carlini, and the haunting theme song by Nino Rota, which must never be underestimated in its overall impact on the prevailing mood of disappointment and tragedy from beginning to end.Although the film occurs nearly a decade after World War II devastated much of Italy in so many ways, the bleakness and impoverishment of the Italian countryside serve as a perpetual backdrop to the tragic events that befall the three central characters. Although I initially believed that the road covered much more of Italy, most of the movie was filmed in only three central Italian locations, including the towns of Viterbo and L'Aquila and the seaside at Fiumicino, not far from Rome.My first look at \"La Strada\" was as a very young boy when it appeared on \"Million Dollar Movie\" during the late 1950's, every night for an entire week at a time. Although I probably didn't have a clue as to what exactly was transpiring before me, even as an innocent child I was very impressed by the faces and words of the actors, the unforgettable music, and the distinctive atmosphere. The film has, of course, immensely improved in time as I watch it as one who has experienced life as an adult.Giulietta Masina is superb as the simple and pitiful Gelsomina who troubles the brute, Zampano, as his conscience until he can no longer tolerate her presence any longer. At one point, although she sees an opportunity to free herself from Zampano's abusive grasp, she foregoes it. For the sake of an undying sense of loyalty? Or is it love? Masina, along with Anthony Quinn and Richard Basehart, both non-Italians, deliver three outstanding performances that create a powerful, emotional force that has not diminished for me in more than six decades. I am so taken by the unique, extremely desolate atmosphere and the extraordinary drama unfolding on the screen that I am unaffected by the fact that the English words of Quinn and Basehart are dubbed in Italian. As in many of Shakespeare's tragedies, it is the fool, played by Basehart, who ironically exposes the human folly around him. Along the way, he also conveys some very thoughtful observations of life and visionary prophecies to a highly impressionable, if not childlike, Gelsomina. His uncontrollable urge to taunt the crude, coarse Zampano leads to irreversible, disastrous consequences. Along \"La Strada\", the road of life, the world is often unkind, and we are only human, not gods, as we struggle to endure its harsh malevolence. In the end, we are left with the unforgettable, solitary image of Zampano (Quinn) on a lonely, cold beach as the violins of Rota's sorrowful theme song haunt us for the rest of our days. Who will forgive us for our human frailties?",

The story is deceivingly simple and it feels at the beginning almost like a piece from \"commedia del arte\", however the master touch of  Fellini's heart and vision talk to us directly through the canvas of Gesolmina's face (Giulietta Massina was his wife in real life). You don't need big words or a crafty developed script. This is like music, speaks directly it does not need translation even most non-Italian speakers find themselves more and more immersed in the visual aspects of this drama, it seems in many aspects surreal (I'll develop this point later) and distant but at the same time there is an underlying tension brought up by the close ups and the music revealing all those emotions much more close to our hearts than we are at first openly willing to admit. This is cinema at its best ladies and gentlemen. No special effects, no grandiose vistas, no colors, no extra help. The intimate nature of these characters feelings talk and paint more pictures than anything else can convey. Regarding the intimate relationship of Fellini and his movies there are already many of his little \"secrets or eccentricities\" that he imposes in all his films, they all have relevant hidden messages, such as the \"white mysterious horse\" and the haunting \"trumpet melody\" are just some of them. Those interested in Fellini's oeuvre should have the pleasure to uncover them with more of his viewing of what this all means, in same cases there is a definite reason in others he leaves it to your own devices and interpretation. He constantly teases us with contradictory emotions, sadness and laughter, complicated and simple, logical and absurd, brutish and angelical. Finally this film is like a great banquet, it seems to drag at he beginning and makes you think that is going to be too long and then at the end it seems too abrupt and you want it to continue, but most importantly leaves with us a savor that will linger in our minds for a long time, those who are sensitive to Fellini's vision will carry this for ever and hunger for more, those indifferent will dismiss it as an extravagant little piece and may be curios for another one.

I would love to be persuaded otherwise but I think he's an overrated director. \"8 1/2\" and \"La Dolce Vita\" are both tiresome exercises in repetitiveness (Fellini is a pro at harping on the same point for three hours), but I was looking forward to seeing something smaller, shorter, and more representative of his earlier work, before he became an internationally IMPORTANT director. I certainly understand \"La Strada's\" appeal among fans, and I also understand how it gave audiences at the time something quite unlike any of the movies being produced by Hollywood. But Anthony Quinn irritates the hell out of me (I know he was supposed to in this movie, but still), and the mannerisms and affectations that others find charming and endearing in Giulietta Massina I found to be distracting.And I wish I could look past it because it seems like a petty reason not to like a movie, but I had trouble getting past the terrible dubbing.

            "content": "La Strada is sadly not a very well known movie, at least in the US where native movies coming out at the time greatly overshadowed it. In Italy, it is probably much more recognized. Directed by the extremely talented Federico Fellini, this movie never ceases to make me sad every time I watch it, no matter how much time has passed. The movie is about an italian girl named Gelsomina who lives in a rural area of italy by the sea. One day, a circus performer named Zampano arrives to ask Gelsomina's mother for her permission to let Gelsomina travel with him. He is doing this because Geolsomina's sister previously traveled with Zampano, but died. Now he needs a replacement. Her mother agrees, and Gelsomina is allowed to go with him. This is where the tragedy begins. At first, Gelsomina thinks that being on the road with Zampano is a good thing, since it allows her to see the rest of the country and go places, but before long, he starts abusing her. Zampano performs incredible feats of strengh to impress crowds, and Gelsomina is his assistant. The problem is, he doesn't like her to make mistakes, and intimidates her when she does. Later on, Zampano disappears with another girl, leaving Gelsomina all by herself and forgotten. Finally, she decides to part ways with Zampano, and finds another street performer who walks tightropes. Zampano finds her and becomes angry that she decided to run away and forces her to join him again. The tightrope walker later pours water on Zampano, which enrages him so much he comes after him with a knife and gets imprisoned. Some time after he gets released, Zampano and Gelsomina come across the tightrope walker again, trying to fix his car. Zampano hits him several times, and not only does it put him down for the count, it takes his life. Gelsomina is too shocked for words and no doubt wants to leave Zampano for good now, but he makes the decision for her. He leaves her on a road one day and rides into the distance. At the end of the movie, it is now several years after the main story and Zampano hears a girl singing the same song Gelsomina played on her trumpet. She tells him Gelsomina is dead, and Zampano wanders around the beach aimlessly, feeling guilty over something he can never atone for. This is one of my favorite movies of all time. Shot mostly in central Italy, La Strada was considered very sentimental by Fellini himself, as it focuses on how difficult the life of a financially unlucky girl in italy could be. As is often the case with great movies, they aren't treated well in their own time, and many critics at the Venice film festival didn't like it. Years later though, people began to see how important it is, due to its sad storyline of a girl trying to escape an abusive partnership with a strongman. The casting is also very good. Anthony Quinn plays Zampano with tenacity and distinction, quickly becoming the most hated character because of the things he does to Gelsomina to keep her in line. Giulietta Masina as Gelsomina is the movie's tragic figure, because of her forced relationship with this brute. You can tell how she tries to get on his good side throughout the movie, but he ignores her. Quinn also said working with Fellini was quite an experience, saying he \"drove him mercilessly\" to do scenes around the clock again and again. Fellini was a perfectionist. It really does show in this movie.",

It was a time of economic misery and people were forced to abandon their children in order to make them earn for the family.The theme of circus is of value to the film as it was the only thing which provided laughs to the people dejected by the trauma of Italy's defeat.The best tribute that strong people can pay to Fellini is by not harassing the weak ones.Richard Basehart looks divine as the fool. Anthony Quinn is devilish as Zampano.Guiletta Masina is sublime as Gelsomina. It was this role which won her worldwide acclaim. If one is looking for a film able to make people better \"La Strada\" is that very film.",

            "content": "I never knew a movie could be a masterpiece until I saw La Strada in 1960, as a sheltered 20-year-old with a new husband and a plan for a life in the theater. Giulietta Masini, Anthony Quinn, and Richard Basehart showed me what acting really was. At the same time I was transported to a time and place in which one was in the company of destiny\u2014joining three apparent losers on the road of life, without means or even hope. Yet they are in a circus. Zampano is brutish strong man, Gelsomina his assistant, and the acrobat and beguiling clown (Basehart) zigs and zags through the scenes making mischief as he performs his high-wire act. They are jostled against each other, reacting and avoiding, needing and rejecting. The road they face is harsh. The landscape of Italy has been strafed by war; their life is as black and white as the film of it.First, and central to all, is the girl, Gelsomina. I identified with her totally. Masini's na\u00eff was the kind of character I had always thought of myself as\u2014like Leslie Caron in Lili and The Glass Slipper, but this film towered above such Hollywood creations. Masini and her mentor, her husband and director of the film Federico Fellini, filled the character of Gelsomina out with a rough authenticity born in poverty and pain. With her clumsy, lost looks, she is the essence of a sweet spirit, impervious to the jolts and shocks of her own life. Growing up on a beach somewhere, a sister of hers has been sold off to an itinerant street performer whose act is based on his physical strength. The sister dies\u2014and we never are to learn how. The strong man, Zampano, buys Gelsomina for what we learn is the equivalent of $10, to use her in his act.We laugh at Gelsomina's attempts at performing, yet her inherent charm and tenderness win us over as well as the crowds who gather to see Zampano's rather unpleasant self-aggrandizing turn. Wherever she is, little children are amused by Gelsomina and are drawn to her as one of them. She is a grownup who is truly childlike.I was awash with tears throughout the movie the first time I saw it. I saw Gelsomina as me, taken to about the 10th magnitude--an innocent in an untenable life, at the mercy of men who did not understand. The playful \"fool\" of the movie did not offer Gelsomina escape from Zampano, but he was sensitive enough to suggest a way she could learn to accept her life with the dark strongman. As it turned out, I would ultimately divorce my husband (who was in actuality more like the clown persona than the heartless Zampano), but I never forgot the movie. I was haunted on some subconscious level by its images and the raw grandeur of its theme, story, and message. I have since seen it again more than once, and it has never lost its power.La Strada is the opposite of a love story, yet the redemption of Zampano, one of the protagonists, lies in that shred of love that Gelsomina symbolizes. If the film makes you cry, so be it. You will meet three of the most unforgettable characters in all moviedom, and you will learn from the complexity and humanity of a masterpiece created by one of the greatest artists ever to work in the medium of film.",

For Giulietta Masina's character that is. Over thirty when she made this and yet you are easily convinced she is a rather simple child. Amazing performance against the abrasive if not done right abusive giant that is Anthony Quinn's character. He maintains his performance consistently throughout whereas Masina goes from wastrel to starry eyed child, and then keen performer with an eye on another man. Some of her wonderful early scenes are with the aid of hat and costume and a dash of facial paint but mostly she draws the character from within ( or from within Fellini, maybe!).

            "content": "La Strada (1954)Translated as \"The Road\" this title makes more sense than you would think at first. It's not a road movie in the American vein, young people finding freedom and the big expanse of life. But it is a story of carnival performers on the road, and we see the landscape all over post-war Italy.If you haven't seen Italian movies from this period, or any other Fellini, you might have to adjust to a couple things. One is a lack of totally clear plot. It does make sense, but it will jump along in little episodes that seem incidental. I think what this means is that the important things in life are incidental, and that it brings the viewer into the ordinary flow of these two or three lives. There is a touch of surrealism now and then, which adds to the strange feeling. The photography is simple but beautiful enough, and the scenery, every changing, adds to the sense that we are sweeping across a whole time to capture it and make it cohesive. The sound is odd, all dubbed in later (voices and musicians playing instruments, everything), and it is so obviously out of synch it again makes the experience dreamlike and bizarre. If you can't get used to that you might just write it off as low-budget.Of course, avoiding the main point until the end, this is a movie that gets into your heart. It's about a mean man and a sweet submissive girl who ends up being his wife, by default. Neither is a paradigm of movie beauty--Anthony Quinn at his roughest as Zampano, a circus strong man, and Giulietta Masina a tiny Gelsomina with a mime-like face that makes her the sad clown of the movie, very sympathetic. By the end, when Zampano is still seemingly unredeemable, we follow his every move and every twitch on his face because we are drawn into the tragedy of his life, even though it seemed avoidable all along. He's just that uncouth, untamed kind of man, and as much as he deserved to be made fun of (as another character does), he receives the empathy of Gelsomina.If you can step into the style and go with the odd flow of the scenes, you might find this a flawless film. Sometimes the best art is idiosyncratic, as this is. There are no inconsistencies, the feeling of the movie evolves and is fully grasped all through, and we are allowed to watch with wonder and understanding. Because we have seen these people before, in parts, and in ourselves. That's why it matters.",

            "content": "\"La Strada\" is a simple tale that attempts to pack an emotional wallop at its climax, which is nice, except that what we're shown as character development for the main antagonist is never earned, and is frankly somewhat incomprehensible.Plot In a Nutshell: A young woman (Giulietta Masina) is sold into bondage by her mother to a cruel and abusive two-bit circus sideshow performer (Anthony Quinn).Imagine for a minute that you have a dog. You treat this dog very poorly. You yell at it, hit it, order it around, demand total loyalty from it. But then when other dogs come around you give them plenty of attention and affection. But not this dog. You kick it some more. And yell at it some more. You clearly have nothing but contempt for this dog.You've had other dogs before. The last one you had mysteriously died. We don't know how, but given your brutal nature, it would surprise no one if it was revealed that you had something to do with its death. That's how awful you are. But anyway, back to your current dog. It's become kind of useless and it barks a lot now. So you decide to abandon it on the side of the road and get on with your life.Years later you are living your same miserable existence. You've never given that dog a second thought and have since found other dogs with which to play. Life goes on. You are not looking for that dog, because frankly, you never ever liked it. It was annoying, right? So who cares.Then one day you hear something that reminds you of that dog. You pursue it, likely out of curiosity, and ask someone what you heard. You are then told that, yes, that dog was here for a while, but it's dead now. And now...NOW...suddenly, you have this instant revelation that hey, even though you treated this dog like garbage, couldn't treat it much worse, really, now....you think you LOVED this dog! Yes, despite your horrible treatment of this dog, you really needed this dog all along. So you run to the ocean to wash away your feelings of guilt for how you mistreated this loyal dog all those years ago. The End.Umm...that doesn't work. I've known people like Zampan\u00f2. They are miserable, worthless, abusive, borderline evil people. And they don't care who they hurt. They only care about themselves. Imagining someone like that have a \"come to Jesus\" moment in the ocean surf is pretty laughable, really. It is certainly unconvincing. And given the reputation of this film (fourth in the 1992 British Film Institute directors' list of cinema's top 10 films), disappointingly unconvincing. Not for a second do I accept that Zampan\u00f2 would be in any way changed, simply by learning that someone he treated like garbage years ago is now dead. No way.6/10. Unrealistic drama that fails to connect. If you want to see an early 1950s Italian film that packs a legitimate emotional punch, check out Vittorio De Sica's \"Umberto D.\" You'll be glad you did.",

            "content": "Reviewing \"La Strada\" is an intellectual dilemma. Any attempt to rationalize the content of such a poetically loaded drama would indecently deprive it from its emotional substance and reduce the story to a simple fable with a rather simplistic message about the power of love, while more complex and universal truths are hidden beneath the apparent minimalism of the plot. Somewhat, the score is like a musical reflection of the film, with five simple notes resonating in our mind as the embodiment of simplicity's value in Arts. The simplest things speak the most eloquently about human nature and a small group of privileged films possesses this universal appeal,\"La Strada\" is one of them.'La Strada' means the road in Italian, as the element keeping people detached from any roots, they belong to nowhere until they finally belong to each other. The two main characters are Zampano, a burly and tough itinerant performer whose number consists of breaking an iron chain bound around his chest and Gelsomina, her new partner sold for ten thousand Lire by her own mother, to replace her deceased daughter, Rosa. Gelsomina accepts her fate with a wise resignation and great hopes for an exciting adventurous future. The contrast between Zampano and Gelsomina is striking. As usual, Guiletta Masina's size provides a sort of female Chaplinesque touch, but it's reinforced in \"La Strada\" where she's confronted to the towering presence of Anthony Quinn, who kind of reminds of Eric Campbell, the giant who played Chaplin's archenemy. \"La Strada\" opens with the strangest duo, a brutish giant and a sweet troll-like girl : the frontier traced by Fellini between reality and childhood's world is, as usual, thin to the limit of imperceptibility.But more than any others, childhood's stories provide the most universal truths. If you look at Quinn and Masina's faces, you'll see one man with strong features and a constant anger that tries to conceal many hidden wounds while Gelsomina's rounded face and sparkling eyes carry the innocence of a little child. Gelsomina is a child not because she's slow and dim-witted but because she's eager to learn, to discover the appeals of this new world. Her childish reactions are driven by a strong desire to please Zampano, feared and loved as a fatherly and authoritarian figure, as she will rapidly progress and learn how to play different musical instruments, and develop her clownish character. Indirectly it will also build a tacit complicity between them, mostly expressed during their performances.Zampano is an intriguing character, he's no less a one-dimensional thug than Gelsomina is retarded, but he's a misfit too. Zampano's only medium to communicate, especially his disagreements, is his burly body. And the only sign of genuine affection and tenderness he'll ever display, happens near the end, when he puts a blanket on Gelsomina's frail body, while she's sleeping, and then, unable to go any further, leaves her. Love is hidden somewhere between their two hearts but seems like incapable to find a bridge between the two coasts. Is it because Zampano's heart is a wall made of unbreakable bricks, or because Gelsomina's is hidden in a small oasis of purity that Zampano's big hands can't reach? The only reality is that love seems so frustratingly impossible, despite a visible affection.Don't expect answers from \"La Strada\", the movie rises above rationality, it's Fellini telling us a dream, and we're allowed to see our own interpretation. I say 'dream' despite the gripping realism of the film, for this constant sensation of floating between two worlds, the earth and the sky, a feeling incarnated by the figure of the 'Fool', the tightrope walker and the third important character. The \"Fool\" played by Richard Basehart is a strange fellow, a human allegory of passion and life's cheerfulness, cruelly missing in the two main characters. He'll give his vision of life to Gelsomina, that anyone, anything, is useful, meant for something, from the stars to the pebbles. Again the 'Fool' evokes the sky and the earth, lost between two worlds, a dreamer who'll elevate Gelsomina, and whose accidental death, will push her soul down and extinguish her last guiding light of hope.The Fool's death is perplexing for me as it plays like a comeuppance from a series of sadistic behavior toward Zampano. We'll never know the reason of his harassment, but in their antagonism, Zampano and the Fool personified the eternal struggle between the body and the wit. The Fool's tragedy is his underestimation of the deadly nature of violence, and incapability to anticipate the danger. Why? Maybe he's so free-spirited that he admits the danger, the evil, but denies the idea of expecting therefore being domesticated by them and renouncing to his own freedom. He acted as tightrope walker with Zampano and fell to death while Zampano repeated his number with Gelsomina, exercising such a pressure on her that she finally broke. Zampano underestimated his strength and Gelsomina, men's natural badness, inhabiting both Zampano and the Fool's personalities. Gelsomina was just a well-intentioned soul conducted by her love and faith in Zampano, a condition mirrored by the episode with the nuns.The movie ends with Zampano's tragic realization. As said the French poet \"one person is missing and the whole world seems depopulated\", the shot of a drunken Zampano in the beach reinforces the idea of his total isolation and the worthlessness of life without Gelsomina. \"La Strada\" is the tragic depiction of the complexity of human relationships bound to the unpredictability of life, where even the wittiest mind, strongest body or purest soul fail to achieve happiness, alienated by their own nature's tragedy and fails to understand, or at least, communicate with the other \u0085 While Nino Rota's music beautifully mourns these tragic destinies, the last shot of the beach paints the infinity of interpretations that Fellini's masterpiece leaves us with, and for Zampano, the tragic end of \"La Strada\" ...",

The two main protagonists are so opposites that they never come close- so how to deal with their relationship? As David Thomson (2008) says in his short essay on this film 'it's my hunch that not many people could endure La Strada today without some numbing potion'. The key character in the film seems to be the \"fool\" - a far more interesting person than either the Quinn or Masina characters. Gelsomina (Masina) is a simpleton and although we might love her to bits (mainly because of her innocence and her smile), she remains just that - a simpleton. Zampano is a simple male bully who needs no sympathy from us - not even at the end. In the 1950s I can see that this was breaking new ground and, as such, is to be admired. But does it hold today? I doubt it given the extreme (and characterised) positions of the two chief protagonists.",

It also expresses his talent for storytelling, character, and ability to amuse and entertain while also being intelligent and meaningful. This is a carnivalesque dance of the human soul, exposing both the positives and negatives of life itself. The characters are some of the finest and most memorable I have ever seen in the film. There is the childlike and lovable heroine Gelsomina, the menacing, abusive, and yet surprisingly sympathetic villain Zampano, and the hilarious and inspiring Fool.

            "content": "It is a very difficult thing to be a movie lover, one of those vociferous ones who gobble up the masterpieces of the 'auteurs' and domestic and foreign pieces known and obscure, without having some appreciation or bugf*** love for Federico Fellini's films. And those of us who may have one or two of his films in a 'if-you-put-a-gun-to-my-head' ranking of our top 15 films have to see all of them at some time or another. La Strada, sadly, was not the first I saw, and it came to my eyes and ears after already submersing myself in 8 1/2, La Dolce Vita, Nights of Cabiria, I Vitelloni. My expectations were quite high, and at the end of a first impression... I wasn't quite taken away with it as everyone else would seem to be. It had such extremes of light and dark, happy and sad, brutal rage and sweetness that it was almost too much for me to take, and I don't always mean in a great way. For a film with such strong actors and a control of the mis-en-scene, it's impression on me was that of an overbearing fable whose perks came mostly in the last third of the film with the big turning point of tragedy.But a second viewing helped things, and I no longer see it as being the \"overrated\" one, whatever that could ever mean with a director like Fellini. Indeed, it's without a doubt a classic... and, still, I consider this dark fable of the strong-man Zampano taking the feeble smile/frown Gelsomina away from her family to be his assistant while alternately terrified of him and in wonderment over the acrobat Il Matto \"The Fool\" my least favorite of Fellini's classics. I say this in not trying to say to any perusers of IMDb's comments section (whoever you are) to stay away. On the contrary, do watch the film, maybe even study it if you're that kind of movie-watcher. Even if I might be less inclined to eat a particular pineapple-chicken pizza from a master chef, it's still undeniable it's still some of the best pizza around. Same case here.Perhaps a small deterrent comes with the language barrier; Anthony Quinn and Richard Basehart are terrific here, but in watching the film you have to listen to the Italian version so as to hear everybody else's dialog, including the perpetually charming Massina. So unless one does hopscotch with the DVD remote to go back and forth between English and Italian, we don't quite get the full force of the performances. And yet, a repeat viewing reveals things I hadn't noticed before (as does happen with Fellini movies), little stitches of touches to scenes, little actions done by characters like Gelsomina or even the BIG performance of Quinns, amid the wide brush strokes Fellini takes to the characterizations.Or maybe it's as simple as its own simplicity for me: it's deceptively simple, and at times one has to wonder what is really going on between Zampano and Gelsomina, why she stays with him through all of his brutish outbursts, and why she doesn't stick with the kind-hearted and whimsical Fool. It's hard not to recommend La Strada, and I certainly do. It may even become greater in my mind the longer it sticks with me, or when it comes on television in further years. For now, I only can say how it didn't affect me as deeply or with the same knock-me-on-my-celluloid-futon like a dose of Mastroianni in 8 1/2 did or even, dare I say, Massina in Cabiria.",

Numerous parameters have to be satisfied: plot, dialogue, character development, premise, believability, relatability, continuity, etc. And they all have to balance with each other. To accomplish all these things with the medium of film must be ten times more difficult, so my hat is off to one of the greatest directors in film history. Fellini delicately pushes and pulls, shaping, twisting, lingering on shots here and there, wringing alternately joyful or sorrowful moments out of nothing. If you think that films are just entertainment, La Strada will prove you wrong, there is real life buried inside this film, it's more of an experience than just a film; how in the world Fellini crafted relatable characters is a marvel in technique.I've watched this film three times in my life, and each time I got more out of it. There are three scenes that have really stuck with me over the years: the first one was when they visited the convent, and the nun takes an interest in learning all about Gelsomina, she's clearly fascinated with this traveling waif who shows up at their door, and even invites her to stay. But Gelsomina makes the decision to stay with Zampano. This is significant because clearly she feels like she belongs with him, even though he treats her badly. The second scene is when the fool convinces her that Zampano likes her; her face changes considerably, and when she picks him up from jail, she looks like a brand new woman, full of hope for something better. The third scene is the end, where Anthony Quinn pulls out every horrible thing that Zampano has ever done and lets it wash over him the way the waves wash over the beach, and we see a lifetime of regret play over his marvelous features. I wonder how many takes it took to get that scene, and it's all done in a single shot.I'll watch this film again maybe in another ten years and I'm sure I'll see something new again at that time. This film is like an old friend.",

It's a change brought about by the Fool, a tightrope walker and Zampano's nemesis. That the tale of these three will end in tragedy is inevitable - the way in which it occurs is not so predictable. Like a miner doggedly prospecting for gold, Fellini patiently uncovers the humanity in a thug who appears to have none, and while Zampano might not find redemption, he does belatedly acquire a devastating understanding of just what he has allowed to slip through his fingers. A powerful, heart-wrenching masterpiece.",

            "content": "Every once in a while I come across a movie that's highly regarded by \"everyone\". This is one such film. To be frank, I don't understand all the hype around it. There are many much better movies than this.First off, how could Gelsomina's family just sell her off - and to a brute like Zampan\u00f2! Strangely, Gelsomina offers no resistance. What's worst: this brute treats her horribly and yet she has the hots for him and even wants to marry him - and she refuses any chance to stay away from that gorilla! This woman can't be in her right mind to proceed that way....Zampan\u00f2 is the typical gorilla: he is a street rioter, intimidating, powerful, violent, brutish, drunk, entertains crowds by breaking an iron chain bound tightly across his chest. I liked the character \"Il Matto - The Fool\". He was quite fun, although he was a little crazy sometimes because he busted in laughter for anything, even if his laughters were hilarious. And it was hilarious when he threw a balt full of water on Zampan\u00f2.Aside Gelsomina's impossible to understand crush on that gorilla, there are some other things I didn't understand. When Zampan\u00f2 beat the hell out of \"Il Matto\", he just died after? He died from 2 or 3 beatings? Where did Zampan\u00f2 hide his body? And when Zampan\u00f2 pushed the car off the road, it just caught fire? It caught fire for being pushed off the road? Anthony Quinn is great as Zampan\u00f2 and Giulietta Masina is great as Gelsomina, but best of all was Richard Basehart as \"Il Matto\".Then again, to understand all this positive feedback on this movie is beyond my comprehension but at least Bob Dylan must have liked it. He cites 'La Strada' as an influence for the famous The Byrds's classic song \"Mr. Tambourine Man\". At least he took something good from this.",

For this reason they introduced the Best Foreign Language Film category at the Academy Awards and this movie shows perfectly why. It was a more than worthy first winner within the newly created category, that of course also still exists today.Thing this movie manages well is that it's quite an heavy handed drama but yet is more perfectly accessible and even somewhat entertaining to watch. This actually helps to enhance the movie its more dramatic moments and serious themes and you don't really have to be a more regular and hardened foreign film watcher to really like and appreciate this movie.It's a simplistic movie with its settings but it's still a complicated and multi-layered movie with its story and characters. The characters and their relationships with each other aren't standard or predictable in any way. It's a real beautiful story, in all of its ugliness, that never goes over-the-top but at all times remains a realistically feeling one.But it's not just the story that makes this movie a great and interesting one. It foremost is also still the way it got told by its director and cast members. Federico Fellini was a real special director in terms of his visual and character approaches but above all he was also a real great storyteller.It's such a beautiful looking black & white movie, that manages to capture the perfect atmosphere for its story. Desolated, sad and dirty but still very heartfelt and warm. Also Nino Rota's musical score really goes along great with the film and enhances this atmosphere.Giulietta Masina is truly perfectly cast in her role. She plays a character that really doesn't has an awful lot of lines and she has to act a lot more with her body and facial expressions. And her whole psychic and face were just perfect for that. She plays an innocent and somewhat naive character, who brings the most warmth to the movie. Anthony Quinn is the brute, in one of his Italian movie roles. Quite funny though how he is supposed to be a strong man and does his act with his shirt off but I just can't detect a muscle on him at all. But oh well, it makes it apparent that he got cast more of his acting skills, rather than his muscle power and physics. Now days that often is the other way around, it seems.A more than worthy first winner of the Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film.9/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/",

The story brings together a brute, a clown and a fool, and each follows his or her nature so that the outcome is inevitable. The nature of the brute is to destroy; that of the fool is to mock; that of the clown is to be simple. This triangle plays itself out in our everyday lives, hounding us relentlessly, breaking our hearts and, from time to time and in place to place, our spirit. You don't have to look far to find it.Here that triangle is powerfully incarnated by Anthony Quinn, Richard Basehart, and, most memorably of all, in the beautiful, amazing, unique, unparallelled Giulietta Masina.As the years go by it's become more difficult for me to watch this magnificent movie. Why? Well, it would be comforting to think that people have learned something from the cruelties meted out by our brutish selves on our simplicity, but we know perfectly well that little or nothing has changed. Nothing probably will. La Strada shows us exactly what will happen, but it happens anyway. I find Maestro Fellini's depiction of it more and more upsetting. Heaven help the clowns.",

            "content": "'La strada / The Road' could be interpreted as a religious story about ransom, but it does not fulfill the charge of being unrealistic. The film opens up a social prospect on the joint experience between two people on which every society is based on. The story arises from the personal reality of director Fellini, his memories and percepts which showed him the journey of two creatures who are unsolubly connected with each other without knowing why.Showman, juggler and muscleman Zampan\u00f2 (Quinn) meets the family of Gelsomina (Masina) and sells 10,000 Lire for taking the blonde girl with him on his motorcycle, modified as a mobile home. From now on, they are traveling together through the Italian province - he performs his big-wig on meager market-places and Gelsomina must assist him dressed as a clown, drumming and collecting the money from the audience. It is a strange couple: the small, childish-naive, young woman, in love with life, who is looking forward for her new job and the coarse, grumpy man who was toughened by the hard life on the streets, who is blind for the environment and who mechanically reels off his performances. Always the same sayings to the same climax when Zampan\u00f2 blows a chain by tensing his chest. Gelsomina, on the contrary, rolls her eyes like a clown while carrying the hat slantingly on her hat, the mere sight of a trumpet bewitches her. When she wildly beats the drum for the first time, she soon feels a struck on her naked legs. Zampan\u00f2 does not tolerate jokes. He drills Gelsomina until she works and behaves like he wants her to. Zampan\u00f2 is a slogger who understands his physical skills as mean to subsist. Entirely different is the tightrope walker Matto (Baseheart), who comes across with Zampan\u00f2 and Gelsomina several times on the road. For Matto the artistry is a light-hearted game, the art is his life. His performance aloft in the air are brim-full of wit, facility and something supernatural - in the manege he wears angel wings on his back. That is why he and Zampan\u00f2 are obviously arch enemies.'La strada' is not only a poetic parable on society in the form of a road movie, above all it is a sad love story where you can discover wonderfully magic moments, powerful and ironic, sad and quiet, this film has an unique rhythm: the immediate change between frisky and silent scenes, between day- and night-scenes. Catholic symbolism traverse the whole film: the angelic Gelsomina finds herself often in the role of a religious figure and in one scene she stands in front of a poster which advertises the \"Blessed Virgin\". Matto personates a Christ-like figure who tells Gelsomina an allegory. You can also see all three characters as a personisation of the Holy Trinity: Zampan\u00f2 is the \"Body\", Matto the \"Spirit\" and Gelsomina the \"Soul\".As a lyric tale about loneliness, the film also aims at transcendency. Not the surface of the things is relevant, but its penetration: Fellini wants to perceive a deeper meaning which makes life, despite every hardship, more liveable. \"You won't believe it, everything is useful\", Matto tells Gelsomina while she - being abased by Zamapan\u00f2 - doubts her own self and questions her existence on this Earth. Even every stone that lies on the floor. Matto picks up a stone. \"For if its useless, everything is useless. So are the stars.\" She nods. Understands. And she smiles.",

            "content": "Bernard Herrmann wrote some magnificent musical scores -- \"Citizen Kane,\" \"Vertigo\" -- but the music was incidental. It corresponded to and commented on the events we see on screen. Nino Rota was responsible for the scores of \"La Dolce Vita\" and \"La Strada\". You could whistle his tunes. He never wanted to escape his country's operatic traditions or his own family background -- circus clowns. His score here is among his most memorable.Anthony Quinn is Zampano, an itinerant strong man who breaks a chain with his chest. That's his entire act. He breaks a chain with his \"pectoral muscles.\" He doesn't make much money. He hits one rural village after another and finds an occasional wedding party, after which he passes around the hat. But he needs a cheap assistant to play drum roles and travel with him, so he buys Gelsomina, Giulietta Masina, from her mother for 10,000 lira. She's not beautiful and she's a little batty and no one is sorry to see her take off in Quinn's vehicle, a motorcycle drawing a small covered cart, which one character aptly describes as \"a piece of junk.\" I'll make the story short. Quinn is so coarse and brutal he can clear rooms without using a gun. He mistreats Masina, womanizes in front of her, slaps her around, gets drunk and scolds her, and thinks only of himself. Here's how they spend their first night together. \"Get up there,\" orders the lustful Quinn. \"Tomorrow,\" says the frightened Masina. \"Ahh, get IN!,\" snarls Quinn -- and he picks her up and throws her into the back of the cart. For some reason Masina sticks with him voluntarily. Richard Basehart is The Fool, a skilled tightrope walker who befriends and advises her, while tormenting the the odiferous, ill-nurtured lewdster. Catching The Fool alone, Quinn beats him and accidentally kills him, which drives Masina over the edge and leads Quinn to desert her on a snowy mountain road. Years later, he hears that she died insane. Quinn winds up drunk and alone, weeping abjectly on a night-time beach.The three principals give performances that could hardly be improved upon. Unfortunately, Quinn's Italian had to be dubbed and they chose someone with one of those harsh gravelly voices of the kind you once heard in cheap sword and sandal epics from the 50s. Quinn's own voice was deep and mellow, though he could turn it bestial at will. As for the character he plays, The Fool describes him as one of those dogs who looks as if he want to speak but can only bark. Basehart has never been better. He's animated, silly, provocative, sensitive, and thoughtful. After being beaten, Fellini has him stagger a bit, remark that his watch has stopped, and then die by degrees. That watch has stopped forever.Giulietta Masina more or less carries the movie. It's her story. And she fits the role like an enzyme fits its substrate, every groove of the role being accommodated by her performance. She has the clownish face and manner of a child, with huge, heavy-lidded eyes, and features that are extremely expressive without any overacting.It's black and white; it has sub-titles; the locations are grimy. The production designer accomplishes the oddball feat of turning a real street square into a desolate stage set, with wind skittering the litter along the pavement. And if you see the movie, you're not likely to forget it soon.",

            "content": "Armed with the Oscar he had won for Viva Zapata Anthony Quinn took off for Italy where he finally got a starring role for Federico Fellini in La Strada. Quinn was not the prettiest face in Hollywood and it would take something extraordinary to bring him up from the ranks of good character players and make him a star.The animal magnetism that his roles had shown were finally given an international stage to shine in La Strada. Tony Quinn is nothing short of magnificent as the brutish strongman Zamprano whose very inarticulateness speaks volumes about his character. The man's just looking for a little love, like we all are.Quinn purchases young Giulietta Masina from her family in ravaged post war Italy to be a kind of helper and stooge in his itinerant strong man act. If this were the United Kingdom, Quinn as a street entertainer would be called a busker. Eventually the two of them hook up with a traveling circus that has a most talented high wire act in Richard Basehart, another American expatriate.Basehart is a harlequin type character and he gets to both Masina and Quinn in different ways. She responds to his elfin charm, but for some reason he pushes Quinn's buttons. It results in tragedy for the two of them.La Strada does not end in a manner that would have fit the omnipresent Code. More I can't say, but it could have been why Fellini's film was not seen in the USA for three years since its initial release.When it did get here La Strada won an Academy Award for Best Foreign Language film. Another sign that the Code was crumbling.As much a star as Quinn, Basehart and Masina who incidentally was Mrs. Federico Fellini is the cinematography of post war Italy. The devastation of the Italian campaign is everywhere, even 10 years after Rome was liberated. La Strada got another Oscar nomination for Best original screenplay, but the cinematography should have merited consideration.The theme from La Strada actually has words though they're not sung. The song was featured on an album done by Perry Como a dozen or so years after the film came out. La Strada still holds up very well after more than 50 years. And it is certainly a milestone in the career of Anthony Quinn and a must for his strong legion of fans.",

Zampano is physically and emotionally cruel to Gelsomina and yet Gelsomina is supportive of him and her child-like perception make her a perfect complement to the selfish, oafish character of Zampano.A simple structure, reminding of the Italian neorealism seen in movies like Bicycle Thieves or Umberto D albeit with a bit more grandiose feel due to Fellini's direction style.7/10 for me.",

            "content": "People might see symbolism in the characters of this film based on the elements. Director Federico Fellini certainly includes his familiar tropes such as the sea, circus, clowns, beach, good women and prostitutes.To me this is a road picture of two not very bright people who end up together. Zampano (Anthony Quinn) is a circus strong man travelling around in a beat up camper van pulled by a motor cycle.His companion Rosa has died, he goes to tell the news to her mother and buys Rosa's younger sister as a replacement. Gelsomina (Giulietta Masina) who he brutally trains to be his assistant.Zampano is a brutish thug, a drinker, a womaniser. I was never convinced whether he loved or cared for Gelsomina, I believe she cared for him and even loved him.When both join a larger circus she comes into contact with the Fool (Richard Basehart) who is a clown and a high wire act.He is sweet to Gelsomina, even a kindred spirit but he senses that Gelsomina loves Zampano and maybe he loves her but cannot show it or say it because he just lacks the intelligence. The Fool like a few other people throughout the film offers her a way out from Zampano but she refuses.The Fool also has a deep dislike for Zampano, always taunting him and driving him to a rage. Eventually their path will cross again leaving Gelsomina mad and Zampano to abandon her. At the end Zampano is left unfolding his emotions to the sea. Maybe he eventually realised the love he has lost.There is distinctive music from Nina Rota. Actress Masina has a clown like way of movement which looked like Harpo Marx combined with Charlie Chaplin.You can see why the circus wanted her to stay. She had an inane sweetness in contrast with Quinn's Zampano whose only ability was the strongman act where he could break chains with his pectoral muscles. If he had any sense he might had realised that that being taunted by The Fool could had been incorporated into the circus act with beneficial results.There is a tragic undercurrent in this film very much from the first scene heightened by the black and white photography and Fellini's symbolism's which he revisited many times in the course of his career.",

            "review_title": "Fellini delivers a bit differently here, bit he delivers nonetheless",
            "content": "\"La Strada\", which means \"The Road\", but the title is never really translated into English when it is shown somewhere, is an Italian black-and-white movie from 1954, so this one had its 65th anniversary last year, which also means it was really high time for me to see it. It runs for under 110 minutes and is of course directed by Federico Fellini, who is also one of three writers contributing on the screenplay here of course. The film is of course entirely in the Italian language, but looking at the cast you would not necessarily expect that. Sure, there is Giulietta Masina at the center of it, but there is also Mexican Anthony Quinn (just won his first Oscar back then) and American Richard Basehart. The latter I was really thrilled to see because I remember him well from his Columbo villain performance that he gave much later in his life/career and it could not have been any more different compared to his turn here. But we shall get to that latter. Masina was really Fellini's go-to actress and it is a bit sad how despite that she is nowhere near Mastroianni's level of popularity still nowadays. So this movie we have here is probably Fellini's most famous that does not include Marcello. This had to do with Masina's strong performance (even more impressive because she had really not much dialogue, especially compared to the two babbling men), but also with the fact that this film won Best Foreign Language Film and it was the first of many triumphs for Italy (and Fellini) and Fellini backed up the win one year after immediately with another Masina movie. We talked about that one on another occasion already though, so let's focus on this one here now instead.It is about a young woman who has to leave her poor family and she is literally sold to a circus strongman for the woman to have some money again, because there are many mouths that need to be fed. This was basically the introduction. Most of what follows afterwards in the first half is the woman's interactions with her gruff master and you can never really be sure if he (Quinn) is fond of her or not, also from a romantic perspective as Basehart's character indicates later on. Early on, he definitely is not. There is the example of how Quinn's character has other women while travelling with Masina's, even if he always returns to her apparently. What was even more telling though was the introduction sequence really when we see how Masina's character is a joyful young woman, but when he is through with telling her how to introduce him to the crowd, she does it the way he wants, but she also has tears on her face. She herself plays a clown during these performances and this should not be seen as disrespectful or anything or sad (I know there is a lot of talk about clowns being sad), but she seems to have a fun time most of the time. Anyway, back to her love-hate relationship with Zampan\u00f2 (I wonder whe the accent is where it is as it seemed to me as if \"Zam\" was the dominant part when pronounced): She has moments when she hates him, like when he violently attacks her and pulls her back, which makes her a bit of a prisoner even, but also we find out that sometimes she likes the theory that the gruff man is just not capable of showing his real feelings towards her, but they are there. I am sure feminists today would not appreciate this at all. As for Quinn, he plays one of the most virile masculine characters I have seen in a while and that chain breaking part, which is shown many times, sure adds to that as well. I still find it incredible difficult to like him. The ending maybe shows that he saw nothing special in her all along. At least not when he leaves her back, even if he gives her the trumpet and may have a slight guilty conscience. But if he had feelings I think he would have stayed with her, regardless of what happened with The Fool (Basehart) before that, maybe at the end though he questions his decisions when he breaks down in tear. In any case, The Fool is right in saying he himself will not live for long, while the strongman will have a long life ahead of him. You can of course question if it is a happy life or if The Fool's short, but joyful life was more worth it. That balancing/dinner scene up there was surely entertaining how he delivered to the crowd, something Zampan\u00f2 to this degree could only have dreamt of, even if admittedly he is not unsuccessful either.With that I mean of course with that is the moment the prankster is killed. Now these two keep having a special relationship with the pranks from one side and the aggression from the other, but that surely was unexpected. It wasn't even intentional by Zampan\u00f2, but still. His reaction also shows that he is not really angry at what he did or felt sympathy for the man, but he is just scared of being caught by the police. And all that after he just stole a lot from a monastery or something despite the nuns being so nice towards him (and Masina's character too). Still, he is not a cold-blooded murderer or psychopath or so, just somebody who does not have control over his aggressions. The way he unleashed against The Fool was even more harmless than I thought he would honestly. far more harmless really. The Fool himself thought he could die perhaps and the moment he reached for that tool was really the only moment when The Fool was really serious you could say. Shows you the significance of the situation. Now I talked a lot about the two men, but as I move closer to the end of my review, I want to make a few other references too about this film, especially one about Masina's character. We may see the brute as an antagonist the way how he acts towards her and because looking at how much she is mesmerized by The Fool, he is a bit of a haven for her, but let us not forget that this is the man who leaves her behind too, who says her face does not look like the face of a woman, but rather like an artichoke. I mean what was up with that. The guy is probably very childish and clearly immature and does not see at all what impact words can have. I am not even talking about the romance aspect and how much you can hurt somebody who has feelings for you, but this is also nothing to say to a friend at all, especially a female friend. So both men have major deficits in interhuman communication and weren't the right ones for her, even if she might disagree. That should be enough about the characters now, just one general statement from me still that I felt this was sometimes not typical Fellini honestly, especially how story-wise this was really a film destined for making a major musical impact as it is frequently the case in many of his other works. But it did not really. Luckily, it delivers in many other fields instead and I certainly enjoyed the watch. Comedy is also typical Fellini, not too much, not too obvious, but here and there a moment that will make you smile. For me (and many others in the audience) the highlight was really seeing how Zampan\u00f2 deals with ice cream, also towards the end already during the epilogue section. Okay, that would be all then. Unless you hate old (Italian) black-and-white movies, this one definitely deserves to be seen and I was glad I watched this for the first time ever on the big screen on the occasion of a Fellini retrospective dedicated to the man's 100th birthday.",

I have some difficulty recalling the details from the 'fifties, and I wonder if this is because I am in denial. Is the movie so bad that I threw it from my mind? This retired cinematographer is appalled at the camera work. It is badly lit, and the continuity is a joke. Perhaps the movie is so different to the Hollywood product of the time that people like me welcomed the contrast. La Strada makes many of the same errors as the Hollywood westerns of the 'thirties. Shots from the motorcycle look like they were done with the mechanical horse Hollywood used pre-war.Then, there are all the awards. Were the other movies of that year so bad that La Strada stood out? The episodes along the road certainly seemed to herald the 'road' movies that followed.The age of the leading lady? Was that really the voice of a naive slow learner, or the voice of Fellini's wife, obviously an experienced stage performer? I was reminded of the mature Norma Shearer trying to be the sub-teen Juliet in Hollywood's Shakespearian opus. Let's not make too much of Fellini's post-synch sound. It was just plain dreadful.",

Well, to be more accurate, she gets sold to him by her family. The movie follows them along as they travel the countryside, gathering money by doing various shows, the most prevalent being Zampan\u00f3 busting a chain tied around his chest by flexing his muscles. You know... high art.The movie has its ups and downs. The characters themselves are easily the best part. The two main characters meet all kinds of people along their journey, including some other circus performers, the most interesting being The Fool, played by Richard Basehart. But it's the two of them that hold the central focus for the majority of the runtime and they are quite fascinating. Zampan\u00f3, a gruff dog beaten by the world and ready to beat it back, yet not an evil man per se. And Gelsomina, a sad and lonely child trapped in the body of an adult. What makes them even more interesting is that they don't really change all that much throughout the film. Sure Gelsomina moves from depression to having some form of affection towards Zampan\u00f3, but yet she still remains exactly the same character she was in the beginning. Likewise with him. It's simply that we get pulled deeper and deeper into them as the movie progresses. They don't change, we simply learn more about them.As far as the story goes, it's not overly complicated, which is fine at first, but in the end leaves you wanting a bit more. It's a character study movie, certainly, but in the end all they do is wander around and have arguments with one another. I liked it, but these two great characters could have told a bigger story without any problems.Still, it's a nice movie to check out and a really strong early work from director Federico Fellini.",

            "content": "Life is a cruel and punishing road that often seems indignant at our audacity for simply walking along it. There are no guaranteed stops but for that ultimate destination, and so how we get there is entirely up to us. Or sometimes not at all. This isn't Cormac McCarthy's vision of The Road of life, in which the entire landscape is enveloped in nihilistic despair, but what McCarthy's road and Fellini's road both share is that the people traversing it have been dealt a meagre hand in life and have to work with what they've been given. The father and son in The Road, despite the post-apocalyptic oblivion that surrounds them, can survive because they have that sacrosanct shield of familial love to protect them. Here, the seed of love between the girl and her master was un-watered, unacknowledged, the cards they were given were misused, often not because of lack of trying but because of a pure inability to grasp them. What Fellini has constructed, like McCarthy in The Road, is a world of which the logistics do not matter, as the greater environment, whether that be an apocalyptic theatre or a or the sparse Italian landscape, simply serves to highlight its characters and their tragedy at its core. I had described this film as conventional, but it is only conventional in the sense that doesn't have these characteristics, and it's not something that you're necessarily deciphering every image. What we have here is a road movie, both literally and metaphysically (yes? The metaphysical road? Yeah, you know what I'm talking' about) in which is immediately accessible because the emotion is so palpable. I was mentioned in my Drive review the weight of physical acting, and how that often bridges the divide between film and audience just as effectively as dialogue does, and that really applies here. Gelsomina, played by Giulietta Masina, Fellini's wife, is such a wondrous presence; her waifish frame, the round face that is like a fishbowl in which we see all manner of emotion flicker by, and the na\u00efve way in which she clowns about, both tentative and joyed is such a sympathetic synthesis that I'm surprised as to how I hadn't actually discovered this character before watching this film, and it seems that is generally agreed that she is something of a female counterpart to Chaplin. She has one of those readily iconic faces, and when she dons her clown make-up she wears these sharp vertical eyebrows that seem to exaggerate her already widened eyes, and throughout the film it is easy to get lost in both the humour and the sadness of them.Gelsomina is part of a large rural family that lives by the seaside, and in the opening shot she frolics at the shore, surrounded by a gaggle of playful children. Life seems fairly simple, and then the rugged and imposing Zampan\u00f2 (Anthony Quinn) turns up, and buy Gelsomina from her mother for 10,000. The whole film carries that neo-realist edge, a world of social struggle, as it seems Gelsomina's mother is financially burdened, as we learn that she has already sold a daughter, named Rosa, prior to this arrangement. Apparently Rosa died. We are never explicitly told how or why, but it is easy to speculate, as we see Zampan\u00f2 who light up a cigarette, all hulking physicality, as he waits to carry of this young girl away from her family forever, and as we soon learn the full extent of his brutality. Zampan\u00f2 is a man who only seems to be able to communicate through his harsh physicality, through which he lives his entire life. He is a street performer, who only has one small novelty act, in which he tightens a chain around his chest and breaks its grip by a powerful exhale. He lives by rote, a simple creature who can easily break physical barriers but isn't capable of breaking emotional ones. As the movie progresses, it seems to almost fluctuate between different rhythms, at some points a comedic routine as when Zampan\u00f2 tries to teach Gelsomina how to perform her simple musical duties with a drum and trumpet, in which she approaches with innocent wonder, and other points the feeling is quite sparse, with long stretches of sadness. I suppose it reflects the metamorphosing of their relationship, growing but never settling because it never has the chance. Gelsomina is ultimately something of a cipher, she seems slow-witted, her eyes flit about with wonder, she takes delight in learning the simplest of things, yet when she speaks she has something of a wiser understanding about her, and I wonder if her clownish innocence isn't something more calculated, perhaps because it is only through this approach that she feels safe enough to interact with the world. But then maybe this is the tragedy of the characters, as they cannot quite reconcile their outward persona with something more sensitive inside; amorphous and flickering between two states. The Fool, who we later meet, played with wonderful exuberance and passion by Richard Baseheart, is the classic fool, who comically strides around at mocks people at his leisure, often cruelly, which is ultimately his downfall, but beneath that is a wisdom and understanding that he rarely shares. \"I don't know for what this pebble is useful but it must be useful. For if it's useless, everything is useless. So are the stars!\" He encourages Gelsomina to understand her own potential as a person, and is the one perceptive enough to recognise the bond between her and Zampan\u00f2. But Zampan\u00f2 is the final tragedy, a brute with a love he could not begin to articulate or even recognise, and when he finally breaks down and cries on the beach, a place which seems like the end of the world, it hurts because like the other characters he understands when it is already too late, and now there is no more road left on which to travel.",

This was my second Fellini film and while there's a lot to enjoy there's still something that didn't really connect with me. Fellini's visual style is certainly a treat on the eyes and I really loved the opening segments on the beach and when Quinn is buying the girl from her mother. The strongest aspect of the film are the performances by the two leads as well as Richard Basehart as \"The Fool\". Quinn is one of the greatest character actors of all time and he manages to be quite brutal here even without using his muscles. His facial expressions and the look in his eyes tell you everything you need to know about this character. Masina is very good as well but I wouldn't say she steals the film (something I've heard others say). The music score is also quite beautiful but in the end I really didn't connect with either of the characters and I felt the film dragged in spots.",

The picture depicts the complex relationship between Gelsomina, a naive girl, and Zampan\u00f2, a traveling entertainer, to whom she is sold by her own mother. When Gelsomina is just about to discover the wonders of the big wide world, she finds out that she's only used as a mere tool by her companion, but there's more to it than that. \"La Strada\" is a movie with a soul. It's a realistically portrayed, highly emotional journey, which constantly oscillates from Gelsomina's good-hearted innocence to her master's brute force, and in between there seems to be no compromise. To Zampan\u00f2 the road just goes on and on, aimlessly, as if that's all there is to life, it's reduced to his own basic needs, and everyone else just fills out a replaceable role. There couldn't exist a stronger contrast to his strong masculine presence than Gelsomina and her innocuous self, smiling in the face of insults and persistent hardship, devoid of any prospects, but her joy lies in the very moment - or the next, as she easily forgets. The unlikely pair however in a way needs each other, even gives their lives meaning, though realization of this fact might happen too late...Plot, screen play, black/white photography, Nino Rota's score and the main cast of this touching human story are all top-notch. Anthony Quinn plays the stone-hearted Zampan\u00f2 to the T and Giulietta Masina, Fellini's highly talented wife, makes a supremely memorable impression as the simple-minded, but endlessly endearing Gelsomina. \"La Strada\", which one might translate with \"The Street\", or maybe more poetically and philosophically inspired with \"The Path\". It's the road that the two characters walk, everyone for himself or both together, and by accompanying these characters the picture delves deep into human existence, holding the viewer tight in its grip.

Very seriously, what can you write about La Strada? What can you write about the faces of Anthony Quinn and Giulietta Masina? About what they can express only by their presence?

That's a politically correct way of saying that I don't care very much for their pictures. Maybe it has something to do with the era in which they worked. Both their styles seem to be drawn out and methodical in a way that doesn't engage this viewer. Personal taste I guess.I recently watched \"The Nights of Cabiria\", another Fellini film with his wife, Giulietta Masina in the lead role. I had to wonder about the way her character Gelsomina was written for this story. There seemed to be particular emphasis placed on the idea that she was ugly, or at least as fashionable as an artichoke, both descriptions offered by The Fool (Richard Basehart). Additionally, I couldn't tell at first if she was mentally challenged, because she did little to engage in a meaningful way with other characters. But later on, she seemed to be an intelligent person but with hurt feelings, and you could sense the dichotomy in her personality. Adding to the illusion, she was made up to look like Harpo Marx, with hints of Chaplin's Little Tramp in the way she conducted herself.For this viewer, this was Anthony Quinn's best role, though I haven't seen \"Zorba the Greek\" yet. I thought he did a good job with a complex character, even though his outward persona was pretty much a brute. I actually had to laugh a bit regarding his strongman gimmick. If you took notice, the chain he used for his act was secured with a rather tenuous link that didn't look like it would be too tough to separate. It wasn't as if, as Zampano claimed, that he was using his muscular chest to break an iron chain.I think this picture would have had more resonance for me in a modern day setting, and if the characters were a little better developed. I didn't really identify with the players in any meaningful way and the randomness of the situations seemed contrived in a way. I might do better with a second viewing, but with so many movies and so little time, it's going to take a while.",

Quinn's character is hard on the humbly woman, beating her when she doesn't perform to his expectations and criticizing her. One would question her desire to want to continue with him despite his poor treatment against her, and finally her heart submits to his crudeness and she falls in love with him anyway. However,in the hands of Fellini, it works perfectly, leading up to one of the most emotionally moving endings I had ever seen in movie history.

That's an amplification. Investigation of a Citizen Above Suspicion? Overemphasis. The Conformist? Baloney. (For me, by the way the worst is Brunello Rondi's Il Demonio). Fellini, however, hasn't always dated gracefully. La Strada is the one particular instance when he still proves his personal and unique touch to tell a rather ordinary story. It isn't an ego epic like \"8 \u00bd\" or a moral mural like \"La Dolce Vita\", but a lovely work of Septi\u00e8me Art Forever. It is the story of Zampan\u00f2 (Anthony Quinn), kinda road runner attached to Gelsomina (giulietta Masina), a girl with kinda mental retard, on their trips to shows his circus-like performances from town to town. Zampan\u00f2 is hard and cruel to the only person who gives him everything. A masterpiece in every sense of the word including three of the best performances of all time - Quinn, Richard Basehart as Il Matto & Masina, - including Neorealist touches and immortal music composed by Nino Rota with full undertones of nostalgia,. Simply spectacular. An art jewel.",

Basically Gelsomina (Nights of Cabiria's BAFTA nominated Giulietta Masina, Fellini's wife) is forced into joining circus strongman Zampan\u00f2 (Lawrence of Arabia's Anthony Quinn) on the road after her mother accepted 10,000 lire, her sister Rosa before she found out died in the same situation. The strongman makes a living performing for public crowds with his \"unique\" performance breaking iron chains with his chest and passing a hat for tips, with her naive nature she goes along with it. Gelsomina also learns how to play the trumpet and snare drum, some dancing, and even gets made up to be clown for the audience, but Zampan\u00f2 only treats her with cruelty and torment despite her trying to please him. Finally she is fed up and decides to leave him, and going into town she watches another street performer, Il Matto - The Fool (Richard Basehart), who makes his living performing as a high wire artist and clowning, but her master finds her and forcibly takes her back. They see Il Matto again when the two of them join the travelling ragtag circus, and there Zampan\u00f2 is constantly teased by the fellow performer, and it is after water is thrown on him that he draws a knife, and the both get arrested and fired. Gelsomina is trying to find a purpose in life now she is in her situation, but Il Matto is released and suggests she joins him, and that everything in the world, a pebble, even her, have a purpose, even if it is unknown. Zampan\u00f2, who brushed her off at the idea of getting married, catches up with them again, and he gets his revenge giving Il Matto many blows to the head which eventually kill him, and he hides the body and car. Gelsomina now has her spirit broken, becoming near lifeless for a few days, and the strongman fed up with it abandons her while she is sleeping. Years pass, Gelsomina finds comfort hearing a song she often sang herself, so supposedly she goes on for a better life, while in the end we see Zampan\u00f2 getting drunk and wandering onto a beach to cry uncontrollably and break down. Also starring Aldo Silvani as Il Signor Giraffa, Marcella Rovere as La Vedova - The Widow and Livia Venturini as La Suorina - The Sister. Masina once again gives a lovable performance with her unusual facial expressions, and Quinn is also really good as the antagonistic and nasty strongman, I did get occasionally confused, but it is a simple story into the dark side of the performing world, and with its interesting imagery and historical content I can see how it can be considered an influential drama. It won the Oscar for Best Foreign Language Film, and it was nominated for Best Writing, Best Screenplay - Original, and it was nominated the BAFTA for Best Film from any Source. Very good!",

Together Zampan\u00f2 and Gelsomina tour the Italian countryside, perform on streets for small sums of money and develop an unusual relationship. He is a gruff and abusive man prone to binge drinking, while she's na\u00efve, fragile and almost otherworldly in her endless optimism. Only after meeting a wild circus performer named The Fool (Richard Baseheart), the characters are forced to change for good in tragic ways.The black & white cinematography looks very beautiful, as does director Fellini's wife Giulietta Masina as Gelsomina. She plays the role with very exaggerated expressions but it only adds to her strange charisma, whereas Richard Baseheart's over-the-top antics as the fiddle-playing jokester come across as more annoying than amusing. In a way this makes his ultimate fate all the more meaningful to the theme of the film though. Is the theme submission? Oppression? Guilt is certainly one of the important emotions explored by the story, but the rest can be figured out by each audience member themselves.Even though I don't personally consider La strada Fellini's best film, it is a calm and beautiful experience all the same. Some technicalities like the obvious dubbing and subsequent bad lip-syncing hurt the impact a little, but they're only minor complaints in an otherwise well-created film. It's not for everyone, but those with patience and interest in meditative art films may find it very rewarding.",

I am pleased to report, however, that La Strada is nothing like the previous two Fellini films that I've seen - and that's nothing if not a very good thing! This film follows a nice straight narrative, and Fellini never strays off the central path. The film, therefore, is easy to watch; and this in turn makes it easy to care for the characters and take in the various themes that the movie offers. It's nice to see the director not overdoing his film, and Fellini shows here that he's not a bad storyteller. The film follows Gelsomina; the daughter of a poor family, who is sold to a travelling fairground wrestler named Zampano. As the two travel together, a bond forms; but Zampano is mean to the young girl and it isn't long before she wants to escape him...even though he may love her. The film takes in themes of love, family and redemption, among others; and the way that Fellini implements these elements into his film is very skillful, and ensures that we can care for the characters and their fates. The ending of the movie is particularly beautiful, and it's hard not to feel for the characters, after watching their story unfold.",

            "review_title": "E Arrivato, Zampano",
            "content": "No one wanted to finance this movie about a young girl sold to a traveling circus performer who ends up dying. I wonder why. It took the international success of I Vitelloni for Fellini to find the money. He cast his wife, Giulietta Masina, as Gelsomina, the simple girl sold to Zampano, played by Anthony Quinn, who worked concurrently on two productions at once (the other was Atilla) and Richard Basehart as the Fool. Taking advantage of the common Italian post-war practice of not capturing sound while filming, Quinn and Basehart were both allowed to speak in their original English but were dubbed over into Italian for the final film. La Strada represented a certain break from the neo-realist movement, but it is interesting to note that the dubbing was common in neo-realist films, which helped to break the reality of the action at a certain point since the dubbing was never perfect.So, Gelsomina is the eldest living daughter of a poor woman in a seaside community. Zampano shows up with news that Gelsomina's older sister, Rosa, died under his care, and he offers Gelsomina's mother 10,000 lira for Gelsomina to replace Rosa. The poor woman feels like she can't do anything but accept, offering up platitudes about how Zampano will teach Gelsomino a trade in order to assuage her own guilt. However, despite being essentially sold into a form a slavery, Gelsomina privately smiles at the whole series of events with a hat on her heard that she playfully bounces back and forth before anyone can see.Zampano is a cruel man, though. He rapes Gelsomino the first night they're alone. He whips her when she can't get his introduction as he wants. He abandons her in a small town for the night as he goes off to enjoy an evening with a local woman. He treats her poorly during their performances where he tries to put on a large show but is mostly centered around him breaking a chain with his chest, a feat that may be as dangerous as he says but feels very small especially when they join an actual circus later. Through it all, Gelsomina is a fragile creature. She searches for her happiness wherever she can find it like planting some tomatoes on the side of the road as Zampano recovers from a hangover or trying to entertain a small, bedridden child near a wedding that the two have tried to entertained but only got fed instead. She has this constant desire to do good, but Zampano tests that in her.It gets so bad at one point that Gelsomina simply runs away. She runs to another town where she sees The Fool tightrope walking between two buildings over the town square. Suspended in the air above the ground, he tries to eat a bowl of spaghetti, only to lose it, his chair, and his table to gravity, all while captivating Gelsomina in the square. Eventually, Zampano finds her again, takes her back, and they end up joining a circus where The Fool has also accepted a contract.Now, Fellini has said that the three characters represents Water (Gelsomina), Earth (Zampano), and Air (The Fool). Others have said that Gelsomina represented the soul, Zampano the body, and The Fool the mind. I feel like devolving the characters to representative elements, though, is a disservice to the characters themselves who feel like much more than just metaphors, and that really comes forward in the later parts of the film.Gelsomina has a chance to escape Zampano when he and The Fool get into a fight and both get fired from the circus. She could continue on with the circus, but The Fool tells her that everything and everyone has a purpose, even something as insignificant as a pebble. She takes this to mean that her purpose is to help Zampano become a better person, so she becomes determined to stay with him no matter what. She will be the light to him. Being post-war Italian, this doesn't really work out that well as Zampano and Gelsomina encounter the Fool on the road later where Zampano hits the Fool so his head hits the car behind him and he dies. Gelsomina's mind breaks at this act of violence, and she can hardly function anymore, stuck in the moment where she wept over the Fool's dying body, and constantly repeating that the Fool is hurt, leading to Zampano simply abandoning her.Years pass and Zampano continues his act, joining another small circus and performing his little feat for small crowds. In a small town, he hears the song he had taught Gelsomina and asks the woman singing it about it. She tells him of the girl who had shown up to the town years before, broken and sad, who had sung that song, and eventually died. Now, these two characters (Gelsomina and Zampano) are at the center of the film, but it's really Zampano's story in the end. He's left alone on a beach (the same beach that Gelsomina was found in the town and a similar beach to where the movie began) with nothing but the bitter feeling in his stomach that his loneliness and isolation at that time is entirely his own fault. He hasn't changed, but he has come to a realization (I've read it as \"ripened\", which I think is a good way to describe it). I'm not sure I would go so far as to call it a redemption, but it's certainly redemptive. He doesn't do anything to make up for his failings as a man responsible for a simple woman, but he does begin to understand his failings that led to his empty life. Gelsomina provided joy and happiness wherever she went, but she was never accepted, especially by Zampano who could have learned the most from her. It's a sad moment of a man, broken through his own actions and his own inability to love.Performance is at the center of this film, and Giulietta Masina gets most of the attention. She's a mixture of Chaplin and Harpo Marx as Gelsomina, and she's rather captivating, portraying a woman of some limited intelligence who also seems to be relatively self-aware at the same time, implying, to me, that she was mostly sheltered and not stupid. However, Quinn as Zampano is the core of the story, and he plays kind of a monster. He's fully realized as a man, but he's definitely a bad man who can't see the things and people that could make him better right in front of him, preferring to pursue his base desires exclusive to everything else. This ends up making me feel like Gelsomina is an angelic figure, sent to redeem Zampano and only succeeds through her own death.I've read La Strada described as a fable, and I think it fits rather perfectly. It's a tragic story of a man called to be more than his animalistic instincts but refuses. He ultimately learns his moral lesson, but only at great cost.This movie is great, perhaps even could be called a masterpiece. It's tragically sad and affecting, pulling the audience in to the story of these two people with incredible skill.",

A brute of the first order he is soon abusing her both verbally and physically and while she vows to leave him she enjoys the attention she gets performing. When high wire artist Matto meets the two he mocks Gelsomina's looks and chides Zampano into rages. After Zampano is jailed briefly Gelsomina gets offers to go with other performers but is convinced by her own twisted logic she must look after Zampano. Things only get worse.La Strada is a heartbreakingly poignant film masterfully told by Federico Fellini with a grim simplicity of threadbare surreal and neorealist canvases of life on the road. Fellini presents us with the bleakest of settings (post war Italy) with three unattractive lost characters yet manages to extrapolate both humor and beauty from this tragic presentation of the human comedy. Giuelietta Massina's stunted Gelsomina blossoms from meek to full potential in a nicely measured way as she experiences life as an itinerant. There are moments in which she over mugs morphing into a Chaplin, Harpo hybrid but by far it remains a memorable and touching performance of lost innocence in the bleakest of circumstance. Anthony Quinn 's Zampano is dubbed but it is the physicality and hooded glances in addition to the all consuming violent nature displayed by Quinn that not only commands but threatens you to give him the same attention scene stealer Massina is getting. In the crucial role of The Fool Richard Baseheart brings both humor, tragedy and a bit of annoyanced into the scenario allowing Gelsomina a respite from the volatile Zampano and a chance to have a two sided conversation. Nino Rota's evocative score of melancholy and carnival joy ratchets up the emotional power to operatic many times in the bleakest of settings; all impressively sketched out by Fellini and cinematographer Otello Martelli's compositions of deft camera movement and placement. Rich in ambiguity and symbolism amid its barren environment, La Strada's deceptively simple narrative style remains timeless with its universal theme and trio of flawed drifters promoting supposition well after the lights have gone up. It is a moving film experience.",

As the \"artichoke\" girl with the mournful eyes, Masina is enormously effective in showing how sensitive her simple-minded character is beneath the harsh treatment and humiliation she must suffer in her search for affection.I would have preferred a soundtrack that used the haunting melody more effectively instead of random chords of music that crop up now and then. This would have added immeasurably to the brooding atmosphere of loneliness and despair in harsh surroundings.RICHARD BASEHART is outstanding as The Fool who cannot resist the temptation to tease and torment Zampano--to the point where he is brutalized by the brute in a final act of revenge. Basehart has never given a performance of this caliber before and is remarkable in all of his tender scenes with Masina.Summing up: A masterpiece of its kind, well worth experiencing.",

He starts taking Gelsomina, who is a poor simple minded young woman, with him in his rides after her mother sold her to him. Gelsomina is his contradiction.. an innocent pure soul that cares for others.. that wants to love and be loved.. that wants to give meaning to her life.She was miserable.. struggling with her new life when she learned from another showman, a character which seemed shallow from the outside and truly was deep from the inside, that everything was there for a reason and a purpose. Zampano, and so she thought, was the purpose of her being in life, and love was there.. but was it enough to change him..After a while she seemed crazier.. or maybe the insanity of people's acts were reflecting on her as she was purer and clearer than a mirror. She had a purpose and fought for it and there in every detail of this great film you will reflect on the simplicity and greatness of love.",

            "content": "\"Rosa is dead.\" As deceased as Rosencranz, Guilderstern, and Jacob Marley put together. Why should we care? Maybe because it's the first line of this otherwise perfect movie, and Rosa is only alluded to a couple more times in its remaining 108 minutes. We never learn how, why, or where Rosa met her fate; the main mystery behind the story of LA STRADA only deepens. Since Rosa's sister Gelsomina has four much younger sisters left at home when she fades from view, it's possible to surmise that Zampano the Strongman had paid another 40,000 lira and already had run through them in sequence by the time he learns Gelsomina's destiny from the laundry lady. Perhaps that's why he seems so sad later on the beach. Possibly Gelsomina was \"the best of the bunch,\" and now he realizes that the cupboard will be bare forevermore. As the Fool's bittersweet theme echos away, one can't help wondering if Fellini's wife (who plays Gelsomina) had sisters, which would have allowed Fellini to tell Rosa's story in a prequel to LA STRADA. If it hasn't been done already, when the character copyright holders give it the green light, maybe they can cast Jonah Hill as the young Zampano. If Jonah cannot speak fluent Italian, no big deal. There are probably more Italians in America than in Italy (which gets all its Olympic baseball players from here), and they speak English, so no one will have to read subtitles in order to understand the prequel about Rosa!",

            "content": "Do you remember that scene in La Nuit Americaine where the Italian diva is complaining about having to learn her lines? She says that when she works for Fellini all she has to say is rhubarb, rhubarb, rhubarb and then she can overdub the correct lines later. I was reminded of this when watching La Strada. I think, for technical reasons, in the early days of Italian cinema all films were shot silent and then overdubbed. This later became standard practice even when it was technically possible to record sound simultaneously. The Italian public seemed to accept it and probably the majority of the films they saw were dubbed American productions anyway. It also meant that Italian directors could increase their box office potential by importing British or American stars without their having to go to the trouble of learning an Italian script. This brings me back to Anthony Quinn and Richard Basehart in La Strada. I was trying to work out whether they were speaking their lines in English or whether they were just saying rhubarb rhubarb rhubarb. At least the voice given to Anthony Quinn sounded reasonable. Poor Richard Basehart was given a squeaky Italian voice. Still, they got no worse treatment than the Italian actors in the film whose lip movements bore no relationship to the soundtrack. Still, its a sign of what a wonderful film this is that I really enjoyed it despite these technical difficulties. Quinn made the most of a very unsympathetic role but Basehart was excellent even with his squeaky voice. The revelation for me was Giulieta Masina who was Chaplinesque in the role of Gelsomina",

Visually the 4k scan looks fantastic - beautifully sharp with deep blacks and nice contrast. The audio track however is disappointing. As a projectionist who has run many older \"academy ratio\" films with mono soundtracks, I have found these particularly good. Nice rich sound with quantities in the lower spectrum that were pleasing and dialogue that was clear and pleasing to the ear. Not so with many European classic restorations. It seems that the visual elements are given a lot of attention but the audio is an afterthought. It was recorded using Westrex sound which Hollywood used but displays a harsh, distorted quality with a lack of bass. This could be better. No excuse being an \"old movie\". Maybe from the early 1930's but not in the 1950's by which time many advancements had been achieved in the area of audio in cinema.",

Anthony Quinn stars as a traveling strong man who buys a young girl Gelsomina to help him out in his traveling business and to be a servant. Quinn's character Zampano is a mean uncaring brute who's a very inconsiderate man. The young girl tries to do her best to get along with her new life until a fellow traveler/performer comes along and changes the duo's lives forever.Anthony Quinn was phenomenal in this movie, his finest hour as an actor. But Giulietta Masina as Gelsomina steals the movie. You can't help but fall in love with the clownish imp. What I enjoyed about this film was the passion and drama the brute and the girl's relationship with each other and how hard and cruel life is on the road.

            "content": "Federico Fellini is best known for the wild, bizarre, carnival images of his later film such as La Dolce Vita, 8 1/2, and Juliet of the Spirits. However, the change from neorealism to fantasy was not sudden but rather gradual as you can see in his early films, especially I vitelloni and La Strada.The setup here is one of the most simplistic stories in cinema history: a young woman is taken away from her poor family to replace her dead sister that used to work with a traveling strongman. The man, Zampano (Anthony Quinn), is a beast, quite literally as we see the way he treats the young, innocent Gelsomina (Giulietta Masina). She appears to perhaps be partially mentally-challenged, but she has the sweetness and simplicity of a child. Yet, for reasons not known to us, Zampano decides to mistreat her and use her as his slave rather than as his assistant. This does go a little overboard, until Gelsomina begins to fall for a trapeze artist, nicknamed \"The Fool\" (Richard Baseheart), who has the same innocent appearance but also has an obnoxious streak in him bound to get him in trouble.Despite all these somewhat rude, obnoxious or unruly characters, Fellini is able to make them human, mostly thanks to the performance of Masina, who is very Chaplinesque in her facial expressions and body language. The whole moral of the story is one that Fellini seems to enjoy telling repeatedly: not realizing how important something is until it is gone. The final shot reflects this so perfectly, it practically makes up for any shortcomings the film has prior to that. The film also has a great mixture of the raw emotion of these scenes combined with the fantasy feeling of the scenes with the circus and other carnival performers. Fellini walks a fine line between the real and the illusive, and the result is simply told but emotionally powerful.",

I don't need a cookie cutter love story or a happy ending to appreciate a film, but the two main characters in La Strada experience no conclusion to their character arcs, with Zampano's arc being nonexistent until the very end. The film has been praised as an unfiltered illustration of the human condition, but I struggled to find anything substantial to take away from that illustration. It feels like I'm truly missing something here. La Strada is hailed as a classic so maybe you'll find a different appreciation for the film but I just don't see justification for the praise it receives. All that said, the first two acts are thoroughly enjoyable and interesting. The acting is great and it's a very unique film, but I the conclusion leaves much to be desired.",

The film has a direct exertion of pathos by coupling two disparate characters, an angelically miserable Gelsomina (Masina) and an uncivilized macho Zampan\u00f2 (Quinn), which may not pander to the New Wave trend at that time, but time proves its longevity and flags the upcoming career flourish which would verify Fellini as one of the most creative and intelligent film auteur in an historical scope. LA STRADA has a starkly primitive settings for the always-on-the-wheel couple, the gypsyish, footloose lifestyle seems to be endless and bleak along with the melancholic tunes, Gelsomina's hapless experience could melt any steel heart and her wide-eyed subservience is too heart-rending to even blame her; Zampan\u00f2, on another level, is a far cry from an evil soul, merely is a man with rudimentary desires and an irascible temper. Giulietta Masina did an almost-perfect work to embody herself with all the ups-and-downs of a poor girl's misadventure both inwards and outwards, her Chaplin-esque clown mimicry and antics have a genuine comedic infusion to the views and by comparison, Quinn's chest chain- snapping stunt is over-used and outdated, but he has his own time, namely, the scenes of his final wail of grief are the salvation for him (a great solace for the audiences as well). Richard Basehart, his portrayal of \"Il Matto\" is queerly vivacious, a sincere contrast to the adversity he would meet in due course. The cameras work miracles too, for example, the night shots of tightrope-walking among crowds has its enchanting depth of focus. Although the world in LA STRADA is a period I could never experience, and it is a more straightforward tale compared with Fellini's other oeuvres, but through the film I could potently sense a clear-minded manifesting of some most precious humility virtues which would also affect people under whatever conditions, to use a tear-jerking story to give hope, which is a marvelous achievement!",

            "content": "La Strada / The Road (1954) :\nBrief Review -A beautiful, heart touching Classic from Italian Master Federico Fellini about compassion and guilt and how it can destroy life. Fellini's crafting of human drama and his craving for showing new proportions in this mainstream genre is unmatchable. I can say it loud and firmly that during 50s and 60s there was no other director to compete him for that. I don't intend to disrespect other master directors from Hollywood and Foreign Language cinema who were ruling critics list and award ceremonies then, but you know every director has some special space of his own and others just can't fit in there. Fellini was the only Boss in this disturbing human drama club. La Strada is fortunately quite a popular flick because of Oscar doll in its Kitty. Without that, i don't think many people would have known about its existence. Well, sometimes Oscars do right things (not always) and the recognition to such films is important so yes i would give credit to Oscars for that and that's even after the fact i never cared about Oscar's Decisions. So, La Strada is pretty much a mixture of human drama with ingredients like love, compassion, misdeeds, guilt and at last realisation of the same. A care-free girl is sold to a traveling entertainer, consequently enduring physical and emotional pain along the way. Giulietta Masina as Gelsomina has acted like she was never acting. While watching her cute expressions i was telling myself, isn't it what they Call Method Acting? Anthony Quinn on the other side, brings that brutal male size hero+villain so beautifully that you hate him but can't resist loving him at the same time. That scream he puts out in the last scene is incredible. Fellini's draft is a cinematic classic by all means, no complaints about anything. We know it and we realise it by the End even if you have to wait for a little while for that so, Don't Miss.RATING - 8/10*By - #samthebestest.",

            "content": "\"Let's hurry to love other people, they pass away so fast.\" (Jan Twardowski) After all these years and so many different opinions about this movie, one assumption seems to prevail: there has hardly been a more powerful Fellini than in LA STRADA. His later masterpieces, according to many reviews, echo the powerful themes of this one. In this 'road film' Fellini addresses the vast majority of viewers. In other words, he practically packs all precious and communicative aspects of his visions to this little wonderful film that beautifully combines simplicity with profoundity and may still be considered as 'la strada' - the road/way towards viewers' hearts. Indeed, his contribution of skillfully emotional direction is undeniably deserving a praise but, let us say it frankly, what would LA STRADA be today without Giulietta Masina, Fellini's wife who could truly embody all sorts of feelings before the camera.Here, Giulietta Masina, in her Oscar winning performance (another one was one year later for NIGHTS OF CABIRIA), displays all that may appear genuine, unique, absorbing, touching in human existence. In a Chapliniesque performance (mind you she does not have many lines and all is written in the face) she is both a perfect comedian and a perfect tragic because she is not particularly attached to her gender. She is a child and a childlike heart, a pure soul. She makes us laugh and cry at the same time. And what is quite extraordinary about her performance is the fact that she does not recall any of her other leading roles in Fellini movies. She is Gelsomina here with no single comparison, reference to acting style or whatever else referred to in other movies. I was not a viewer who kept to the chronology and saw NIGHTS OF CABIRIA before LA STRADA and though the movies carry some resemblance of human drama within the skeptical and even sarcastic society, one cannot simply compare them. These are two different characters created uniquely on the screen thanks to masterful skills of Ms Masina. She is unforgettable in all the scenes of the movie, she leads a viewer to intense emotional experience through her tears while leaving the monastery, through her smiles at one reclusive kid Oswaldo, through her fearful eyes at Fool's death, through her sorrow of resignation on the streets. One of the most brilliant performances ever! The male characters make for an even more astonishing conclusion of psychology blended with simple perceptions. They are depicted in terms of their relations to Gelsomina. Anthony Quinn portrays legendary Zampano - a typical 'macho,' embodiment of arrogance that may evoke from physical strength, a man with lungs of steel and heart of disguise. Two scenes practically depicts his character in the most memorable ways: firstly, it is the bar scene when woman equals with flesh, a flesh to be taken advantage of and secondly, it is his final drama when he shouts out what has, actually, been hidden within him: \"I need no friends! I need no one!\" Can he occur a little human to such a genuine character as Gelsomina? What more does she mean for him but a 'monkey' to be trained, a 'slave' at hand? As his contrast comes Fool played by wonderful Richard Basehart (people interested in Italian cinema of the time will probably link the actor to Valentina Cortese, yes, he was her husband for a decade). Fool is not so much a fool but a vibrant and enthusiastic character who lightens up Gelsomina's darkest thoughts. He comes as a cure, as the one who, in an unforgettable scene of consolation, shows her a simple stone, a stone that exists in this world for some purpose. He is a legendary, symbolic optimist, weak in the eyes of powers of the world but quite captivating inside. Fool is the character that still has much to say to our modern yet depressed society. Like Gelsomina, he sees the world in simple terms, he can smile at a leaf, he can make other people laugh, unlike Zampano, directing his tricks towards people's enjoyable moments not narcissistic shows. Can Gelsomina like such a man on her 'la strada' of life? Indeed! But Zampano has something else to say and something outrageous to do...Apart from the flawless performances of Giulietta Masina, Anthony Quinn and Richard Basehart, LA STRADA can boast of wonderful art direction by Otello Martelli and tremendously touching music score by Fellini's mainstay, Nino Rota. The song of Gelsomina that finally leads Zampano to a moment of reflection, to a stop in his egocentric life is something that remains in the ear for long.But I think that many viewers nowadays skip the major point of this wonderful movie. They usually view it as merely an important production in Fellini's career or a significant product in history of cinema. But they do not see that this is one of such films that can timelessly speak to generations, to our generation too. It has the power to open us towards seeing other people, caring for them before it is too late. That is why I decided to open my review with this quotation of a man who certainly does not have much to do with the movie itself but his words beautifully refer to the content of LA STRADA.Start to love other people...was it too late for Zampano? In the waves, she appears to speak clearly while in silence childlike heart makes its safe 'la strada' Play your song, Gelsomina, play it to the world though it pretends to be mute to tunes of heart! Play it out loud as long as there are individuals somewhere on earth who dare shed a tear at your story.",

            "review_title": "Good early Fellini",
            "content": "Italian filmmaker Federico Fellini's 1954 black and white film La Strada (The Road) is one of those films that is midway between his early Neo-Realism and his later Magical Realism, with touches of both aplenty. It made both him and its female lead, his wife Giulieta Masina, stars, won the 1954 Venice Film Festival's top award and the 1956 Best Foreign Picture Academy Award, yet there is something missing from it. It is a good film, arguably a very good or near-great film, but it is definitely not a great film. It lacks the intellectual and artistic depth that the couple's next famed collaboration, Nights Of Cabiria, three years later, would have. In a sense, those critics who have called it a simple fable are correct, but even the greatest of fables cannot compare with the greatest of novels, especially those modern masterpieces, for a novel takes an in-depth 360\u00b0 spin around life, and within life, whereas fables and this film often rely too strongly on archetypes, schmaltz, and sentimentality. It is not a reworking of The Beauty And The Beast tale, either, for it's not really a love story, but a loveless story, in the sense of the human denial of love. Granted, it's a mark of Fellini's consummate filmic skill that one is so easily emotionally manipulated, to the point that most viewers even care about the wretched Zampano at the film's end. But, mastering puppetry is not the same as producing good art. If it was the old Lassie American TV shows from the 1950s and 1960s would be right alongside The Odyssey and Guernica in the pantheon of great human artworks. Yet, Fellini is so great a filmmaker that even where his art is not top notch it can inspire admiration for its excellence\u0085. The story the film tells, penned by Fellini and his long time collaborator Tullio Pinelli, is first rate, even as it comes awfully close to syrupy, while the black and white cinematography by Otelo Martelli is solid. La Strada is not a visual feast for the eyes, and some mat shots as the pair drive around in their wagon date the film, even as they are better than the techniques that filmmakers like Alfred Hitchcock were using in America. But, the film is renowned most for the film score by Nino Rota, and the theme for Gelsomina that, even millions who've never heard of, much less seen, La Strada, will know from just a few bars. Yet, it does not hold up as well as other, later Fellini films, to a modern eye. It does have more in common with 1940s Hollywood films than many critics would like to admit, especially in the screenplay and scoring aspects that link it back to the social realism of 1930s American studio films- those starring a James Cagney or John Garfield.Still, given it's Fellini, it's much better than many other films ever made, for there are those moments one can only get in a Fellini film, just like Ingmar Bergman can only give you psychosexual angst at such a high and poetic level. With Fellini, it's those absurd moments that just stay within realistic bounds, like Gelsomina seeing a horse loudly clomping down a city street while alone and waiting for Zamapano to come back after a night with a whore, or seeing three country musicians marching by after she runs away from Zampano and is fascinated by an anthill, or her evocative theme song, first played on The Fool's mini-violin, or the oddly poetic and comic poof of a cloud that explodes from The Fool's inexplicably fiery car after Zampano pushes it off the road, into a ravine, after he kills the man. These are the touches that, even when a great artist is not in top form, separate that artist from all the many pretenders. Fellini was no pretender- he was the real thing, and La Strada is a very good film. But it was an even better augur.",

            "content": "This early Fellini just did not affect me like Nights of Cabiria did, leaving me a little cold and unsatisfied. It has many of the same motifs: The same bleak post-war environment and poverty; predatory men abusing women, treating them as pets and playthings; musical processions; religious longing. Perhaps it was too predictable in it's plot, especially as I'd watched the Scorsese intro clip which gave away all the major story beats; perhaps I wasn't too impressed with Anthony Quinn, though he certainly has the looming brutishness to carry the part.I think though the major reason is that Giulietta Masina feels shackled here: As an actress as subservient to Quinn's brooding loutishness as her character is, and barely given any speaking lines. I wanted more of her, as we were treated to in Cabiria, where her expressive face and personality fills the screen. The argument that the film is about the Zampano character's transformation in the ending scene falls utterly flat to me, and I almost feel like Cabiria was a 'make up' project for Giulietta being so secondary to Quinn in La Strada. The Italian studio dubbing I also found somewhat distracting.But another reason is that La Strada does not feel as complex and layered as Nights of Cabiria. For example, the depth of despair, longing, and satire, shown in the church procession scene in Nights is just not present in this earlier film. However, I didn't get to re-watching with the commentary turned on, nor to the documentary on the 2nd Criterion disc. No doubt those will increase my appreciation.",

Everything seems in the film for a reason. Nothing is wasted. Not a single scene. *SPOILERS*And to see Zampano break down in the last part, finally realizing his own humanity and awareness of other human lives other than his own is painful to watch, because you realize that it is too late. He has sacrificed two lives to come to the harsh realization that it is possible to love. There is a compassion, humanity and universality behind this tale that extends beyond time and space.",

            "content": "Gelsomina so sweet, so na\u00efve. I am trying to follow this in Italian, and the English subtitles help. Anthony Quinn so brutish, so believably a lout with a heart of coal -- until later on when he helps Gelsomina -- and even later when he is utterly drenched with his own guilt and knows that The Fool and Gelsomina are gone. Their messages have seemingly been lost on him, but perhaps now is truly sorry for his horrible treatment of them.Did The Fool have a premature heart condition? I was hoping he was really alive, and would return to get Zampano back for trying to off-him. Did The Fool really care for Zampano? Why did The Fool spend so much time teasing Zampano? Gelsomina decided early on that Zampano was an outrageous bad guy, but later she seemed to have grown some sort of dependency and even \"love\" for him. Was she jealous of his one-night-stands with the local \"donne delle sere\" (ladies of the evening...). The Italian should be close to being correct.I loved Gelsomina's clown/mime face makeup. She was great at the dancing and trumpet playing. She always wanted to sing and dance professionally, so here she had to put up with stupid \"the great\" Zampano in order to achieve her ambition. Early on, Zampano beat her with a switch, and did other bad things to her physically, later. She was smart to leave him. I had hoped she would go off with The Fool, riding off with him into the sunset. I thought at first look that The Fool was really cute and very, very nice, compared to Zampano.The Fool was clean-cut, and seemed more the sort of man that Gelsomina deserved. I thought Basehart was really cute in this movie, seeing him for the first time as a flesh-and-blood good-looking man, but I remember he had not-so-romantic roles in other movies. Basehart was very darling to look at in \"La Strada\", especially with his curly hair. I thought it was very smart of Director Federico Fellini to have Basehart lie back on that bench with his feet in the air, delivering his lines. Zampano could never have pulled off a lighthearted scene like this. Il Matto/The Fool had a very playful, daring and smiling personality.I still love song and dance movies best. You know that. Gelsomina danced, and so did The Fool, in a way. When on his high wire, The Fool was a great artist and athlete -- and he was dancing with the forces of nature. He was very popular with the crowds below, and they loved him. In contrast, Zampano's \"performance\" was merely to break metal chains surrounding his chest. Zampano had a rough caveman-type personality, while The Fool danced through life in a happy, carefree manner.Looks like Gelsomina was way smarter than The Great Zampano. So was The Fool. Zampano, in the end, was alone, friendless and utterly saddened. His life was over. He was a ruined man.10/10",

It's two main characters are played by Giulietta Masina and Anthony Quinn, both perfect for the roles they got; Masina, who I only found out recently was Fellini's wife, with her fragile look is great as Gelsomina however I would argue it's Quinn's performance as the bruttish Zampano the most unforgettable of the two, I haven't seen him in any other film besides Lawrence Of Arabia but I can deduce from both of these masterpieces that he must be one of the great actors of cinema.The black and white cinematography is gorgeous and some of the visuals in this film are simply unforgettable, the best example probably being Il Matto eating spaghetti on the wire.The wonderfull score is by Nino Rota who also starred in another of Fellini's great films, I Vitelloni, and it beautifully complements the film.Despite all of this I still can't quite say I like it as much as I Vitelloni, the film from this director I saw previously, who hits me on a very personal level, but nontheless this was an incredible watch and it only hightened my expectations for the next Fellini film I'll watch, La Dolce Vita.9.6/10.",

Fortunately, it has been acknowledge as one for more than 50 years and it has been widely discussed and analyzed for some of the most talented film scholars. There is also a variety of very goods review here in IMDb. There is nothing insightful I can add to those reviews. I would only recommend you to watch this movie. And watch it not only once, but at least twice. And watch it again. Part of its beauty is that Fellini doesn't impose a message on it; instead you are free to draw your own conclusions and get you very own interpretation of this apparently simple story. And those conclusions and interpretations may change or expand every time you watch it. Also, in a first view you may be totally absorbed by the great performances of Mighty Quinn and genius Giuletta Masina. But in a second view you can pay a little more attention to our third player: Richard Basehart as Il Matto. Mr. Basehart was a great actor and he was a master in conveying a complex character with very subtle gestures. Underneath the joyous and carefree fa\u00e7ade of Il Mato lies a painful loneliness. Just watch for the scene where Gelsomina is looking attentively at a pebble and Mr. Basehart is looking at her with a face showing a world of sadness. The shot last only a few seconds, but it's incredibly touching. And the movie is full of this kind of beautiful, meaningful vignettes. This movie made me fall in love with three things: 1950's movies, Fellini's films and Richard Basehart. Enjoy!",

She learns her sister, Rosa, has died; she was an assistant to the traveling street performer, Zampan\u00f2 (Anthony Quinn). Gelsomina's mother wants her to take Rosa's place as Zampan\u00f2 has paid her 10,000 Lire for her.Zampan\u00f2 turns out to be a large, quite brutal unfeeling man, who nonetheless trains Gelsomina to learn how to be a good assistant. She clowns well, especially with children, dances, and learns to drum and play the trumpet to support Zampan\u00f2's acts of strength. There is a distinct Charlie Chaplin na\u00efve wisdom in her character. At one point, Zampan\u00f2 and Gelsomina join a larger circus that includes Il Matto \"The Fool\" (Richard Basehart). The Fool is a high-wire performer who begins to mock Zampan\u00f2 during the latter's performance. This results in a fight that lands both of them in jail, and both are dismissed from the circus. Martin Scorsese describes The Fool as a Robin Williams kind of character who always ends up pushing just beyond the edge.Sometime later, Zampan\u00f2 and Gelsomina stay at a convent, and Gelsomina tries to bring their relationship to a head. She is emotionally attached to Zampan\u00f2, though it could hardly be described as love. She offers to marry him, but he is dismissive. Soon after leaving the convent, they encounter The Fool on the road repairing a tire on his car. Again The Fool mocks Zampan\u00f2, and they end up in a fight. Zampan\u00f2 only strikes him a couple of times, but The Fool dies as a result. Zampan\u00f2 tries to make the scene look like an auto accident, and they leave. However, the incident breaks Gelsomina's spirit, and she is no longer able to perform. Finally, one day, when she is asleep, Zampan\u00f2 leaves her with some clothes, some money, and her trumpet and leaves.Four or five years later, Zampan\u00f2 is part of a circus again, and in a town hears the song that Gelsomina used to play on the trumpet. The woman who was singing said her father had found a girl who did not speak but played that song. She had died several years before. Learning of this drives Zampan\u00f2 to deep despair as he reflects on what he has lost.This film got a mixed reaction in Italy when first released but won the first Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film. It is said to include many themes that were important to Fellini. It is now regarded as a classic.",

            "content": "Drawing on the great traditions of  both silent and sound movies, Federico Fellini creates in La Strada a magical, poetic masterpiece,  which can  be enjoyed and interpreted on many levels. At its simplest, it is a moving story of unrequited love between two lonely people - Giulietta Masina's sweet, innocent Gelsomina and Anthony Quinn's brutish Zampano, a circus strongman, to whom she is sold to become his assistant. But Fellini adds to this basic, seemingly realistic, story many surreal and symbolic touches, so that the movie is not just about yearning, loss and rejection in human relationships, but about the search for meaning in an increasingly meaningless world, and ultimately perhaps about our loss of God and/or his rejection of us. Quinn's performance is one of his very best; Zampano's treatment of Gelsomina is loathsome, ranging from physical abuse to sheer thoughtlessness, but Quinn portrays him as no monster, just a flawed man. Masina is enchanting, whether she is mugging and prancing a la Harpo Marx in her job as Zampano's sidekick, or expressing her pride and devotion to him in those moments when he treats her as a companion rather than as a thing. Perhaps more complex and enigmatic than either of the principal characters is \"Il Matto\" (The Fool), a tightrope walker, played by Richard Basehart. Though on a superficial level, he is lighthearted, intelligent and versatile in contrast to Zampano's sourness, ignorance and reliance on a single trick, and although he befriends and supports Gelsomina, his mischievousness and intervention have a malicious edge, and eventually he is the agent of tragedy. Fellini emphasises the marginality - and economic poverty - of his characters by setting much of the movie in the wastelands at the edge of town, in roadside campsites, or on the beach between land and sea. But these empty, often ugly, prospects may also express the literally God-forsaken nature of much modern life. Nevertheless, there are contrasting scenes, depicting a richer side of life, such as the wedding scene, Il Matto's tightrope walk over the town square, and the religious procession that proceeds it. All aspects of the film are enhanced by Nino Rota's expressive score, containing orchestrations and themes used in other Fellini movies, which help create correspondences between these different films.La Strada has no happy ending, and indeed it could be regarded as a deeply pessimistic and even despairing work; but sentimentalists might prefer to suppose that Zampano has not reached the end of the road as he lies on the beach at the film's close, but will find redemption and rejoin life's circus.",

This is from Fellini's first years, so there is a solid story, but also a work of art like I Vitelloni, but La Strada is one of my favorite Fellini films, from the early years of him, the best. And the film has a great final. Zampano is a very macho man and hurts people. When he gets angry because of any reason, but mostly they are not reasonable, he becomes a monster. It does not matter a man or a woman, he just attacks. Gelsomnia is a sweet and credulous girl, a 'Pollyanna'. Even if Zampano insults her, an inevitable fact, she does not do anything, instead she likes him. This might be interpreted as women mostly like tough guys, macho men or as she is too pure. May be, she has not another option. However, she likes a monster. She does whatever Zampano wants, a typical situation in the relationships of macho men and the women around them. And so on. La Strada is a real character movie, it says many things about men and women relationships and also love that is not a common thing in cinema. By the way, there is a little surprise in the movie which is about waking up. And the scene I will never forget. Zampano buys a cone of ice cream with lemon. He eats the whole ice cream with almost one bite. May be the coins in his pocket are only money that he has. However, he finishes it in a minute, without enjoying. He does not value it as he does not to the girl who likes him.",

The best thing i liked about the movie is that circus is not romanticized meaning I got bored in the circus scenes as i get bored during the circus. This is Fellini's comprehensible cinema. You watch it and the impact is direct. It doest hit after 3 days in your sleep when all of a sudden some character from the movie pops up and plays around. I actually went to an Italian brothel in my dream after watching 'Roma'. Camel haunted me for days after Satyricon. I found this the best in the trilogy and otherwise also. Ill Bidone is also very good but solitude comes out gory in this one. The last beach scene reminds me of Ill Bidone but the helplessness of Zampano comes out so well. The whole chain breaking act of the zampano is just brilliant. It is so many times in the movie and every time I like it because it reminds me of all the roadside shows i have seen. Giulietta Masina is very good. She brings out the compassion even for the evil very well. Anthony Quinn rules the screen. Richrd Basehart-'The Fool' is also very convincing. A great movie.

            "content": "La Strada brings two souls together to tell a story that ultimately displays humanity's finer aspects. The title gives a clue to the meaning of Fellini's masterpiece: The Way. The brute, Zampano, buys the urchin-like Gelsomina to be his traveling companion in his one-man carnival act. He is physically and emotionally cruel to her. Her longing to love and be loved, and her child-like, yet acute perception of life, and desire to live it, despite hardships, makes her the perfect complement to the selfish and despicable Zampano. Their unification affects each other. However, although Zampano's harshness adversely effects Gelsomina's life, it is her influence that will eventually, and more significantly, change him. This may sound like the familiar Beauty and the Beast fairy tale, but it is more than a love story. It is about love, but it isn't until the very end of the film that we realize it. More than love, it is about a man who gains insight and awareness because of love. It is his finale transformation that demonstrates both the frailty and vitality of the human condition. It overpoweringly suggests that the individual, no matter how depraved, is able to spiritually evolve.Every frame and scene in this masterpiece has purpose and meaning.",

            "review_title": "A Felliniesque fairy tale !!!",
            "content": "'La Strada' is considered by many critics to be the first film made by Fellini which can be given the tag Felliniesque. His earlier work as a screenwriter as well as his previously directed films had a very palpable sense of neo-realism enriching them. This was the first film where Fellini started to break off from some of the norms of Italian neo-realism and make a gradual transition to a more poetic and surreal visual language. This directorial decision also made a number of Italian critics of the time negatively remark upon the film as well as Fellini for his 'betrayal' of neo-realism.Having said all that, I still think that 'La Strada' borrows the basic societal background from neo-realist films. The film opens with Gelsomina's family. We get to know about their sorry plight from a financial standpoint. The matriarch has to sell off Gelsomina to Zampano just to get some money so that the others in the family could be fed. This element of abject poverty in post WW2 Italy forcing ordinary people to compromise is something that was an integral part of Italian neo-realist cinema. But in the previous neo-realist films, this economic insufficiency served as the main driver of the plot, whereas in 'La Strada', Fellini uses this poverty as the backdrop, but the essential driver of the plot is the personal existential crisis suffered by the characters. The screenplay of the film written by Fellini, Tullio Pinelli and Ennio Flaiano is simple. The basic storyline is something which is very familiar. Two different characters get together and they hit the road and on the way they confront certain realities about themselves. But Fellini, through his direction adds a fantasy/fairy tale like element to the film that makes it unique. Gelsomina is a naive, gullible young woman who gets thrown into an unfamiliar world with a complete stranger. Zampano is the big, arrogant, rude, brute of a man who keeps treating Gelsomina in the worst ways possible which involves constant slapping and physical assaults. She keeps taking it because she loves the actual performing aspect of the work. She keeps wandering off akin to her natural wild ways. She then meets The Fool, another travelling artist. Although he is not the most perfect individual either, but even then he is the one who at least verbally communicates with Gelsomina and gives her hope and encouragement by telling her that everyone, including she has a purpose on this Earth. In a way the film can be viewed as a vehicle for the transition that takes place in Zampano's character. 'La Strada' in Italian translates to The Road. It is Zampano who travels on the road to achieving a conscience. He gradually comes to realise the wrongness of his ways and behaviour and repents. But he does so when it's too late. Although 'La Strada' doesn't have the visual flair and bravura to the extent that is present in the Fellini films from 'La Dolce Vita' onward, however even with the restrained camera work, there are still moments of typical Felliniesque surreal visuals like the sight of a single horse walking down the street, the three musicians appearing out of nowhere to cheer up Gelsomina, the shot of The Fool wearing angel wings sitting on a chair on the rope suspended in the air,etc. Nino Rota's music beautifully accentuates the moments of a change in tone. The camera movement is restrained, but still expressive. Fellini uses the beach in a thematically rich way which elevates the scenes staged there.For me the best performance in the film comes from Anthony Quinn. The character Zampano represents the cold, brooding individual who has decided to wear a thick armour of insensitivity. His character represents a cynical world view which juxtaposes the naive and gullible character of Gelsomina and also to some extent The Fool. Just like Jake LaMotta in 'Raging Bull', Zampano is a character that is easy to loathe due to his despicable demeanour. However Fellini gives Zampano the chance to start his journey at redemption through the heartbreaking last scene of the film where Quinn gives a masterclass of emoting and expressing so much without saying a single word.The only reason why, 'La Strada' doesn't get an 9 or 10 in my books is because of the way Fellini uses the character of Gelsomina. From a thematic standpoint her character makes sense. But the way in which she gets portrayed by Giulietta Masina is a little too corny. I can understand that the exaggerated mannerisms and Charlie Chaplin-esque antics goes with the fairy tale-esque feel of the storyline. She even looks adorable with the big eyes and it does break your heart when she is constantly abused by Zampano and forced to grow up. But I do think, the film could have worked slightly better with a little more understatement to her character mixed with the clown-like behaviour during the performance scenes.I don't think 'La Strada' is a perfect film, but it still has so many elements that could be admired. Fellini's command over the visual language is very apparent. This is the work of a master filmmaker who was still sharpening his skills.",

            "content": "La Strada or The Road as it is literally translated is the winner of the Oscar for Best Foreign Language Feature in 1954. Directed by the late Federico Fellini, a world cinema great whose body of work includes influential films such as 8\u00bd (1963) and Amarcord (1973), La Strada is perhaps his most accessible feature. It is well-loved by Fellini diehards because of its simplistic filmmaking though it remains to be one of the director's lesser efforts. Often described as 'a magnificent ringmaster', the Italian filmmaker loves to re-imagine the circus in cinema. His characters are like clowns in an act; they are sometimes innocent, at other times mischievous. Fellini calls La Strada \"the complete catalogue of my entire mythological world\". While that is slightly exaggerating, there is no doubt that the film most resembles an intimate circus performance, an environment whose oddball characters feel at ease playing their roles as entertainers. Starring Anthony Quinn as Zampano The Strongman, Giulietta Masina as Gelsomina, and Richard Basehart as The Fool, La Strada is a comically tragic film that focuses on the plight of the waif and retarded Gelsomina. She is sold to the grumpy and short-fused Zampano by her poor mother, riding on an old, rusty bike trailer as she follows him around Italy as his assistant in his shows. They meet The Fool in their journey, a man who loves to flirt with danger either walking the tightrope or agitating Zampano in a series of verbal and physical pranks. Fellini uses the distinctive, expressive face of Masina to marvelous effect whose gestures are a reminiscent of Chaplin. Although not very smart, Masina's character appears to have a cheerful persona. Unfortunately, she does not feel loved by Zampano (who likes Gelsomina but is incapable of expressing love), often cutting a lonely figure, and tries to seek solace in The Fool as well as through her role as a performer. As a result of Zampano's actions, La Strada becomes a wrenching tale of unfulfilled emotions and unredeemable regrets. Fellini's fourth feature is one of the first few films to move away from the Italian postwar neo-realism depicted in films such as The Bicycle Thieves (1948) and Umberto D (1952). Told in a mostly fabulist style, La Strada is accompanied by great music by the legendary Nino Rota (The Godfather), a frequent collaborator with Fellini. Not only does the film feature outstanding screen performances, it gives viewers significant insights to the flaws of the human character. La Strada is also the film that launched Fellini's international career whose future works often revisit similar themes.

There are times, as one of your other readers indicated, when she does seem to drop the emotions too quickly.  But I think that is part of the charm of the character.  She is a rather simple girl from an impoverished time, and she has never had anyone love her completely. Consequently, she doesn't love herself fully; but she has enough dignity to know that she should.  And that others in her life should at least try to love.  It's quite an accomplishment.  And to be frank, I had almost given up on watching Fellini films because I've watched so many that just left me cold.  But this one makes me want to see more.",

This simple story of two diametrically opposite characters brought together against the backdrop of post-war poverty stricken Italy is superbly told through stunning B&W cinematography, haunting music and exceptional performances by the lead actors, especially Anthony Quinn as Zampano. The man, a roadside performer, is incapable of any soft feelings, let alone love, for another human being. The girl, sold to him by her mother, hates his insensitive and brute nature, yet tries to adjust, till he commits a horrific act which scars her already fragile psyche, and a point of no return has reached between the two.

Up until mid-third act, I thought this was Gelsomina's story. But then comes Zampano's abandonment. To be in keeping with the film to point, Fellini would have had her fall asleep and wake to find money in her hand and the trumpet by her side. Instead we see it from Zampano's perspective, and after he abandons her the story is firmly his.With this in mind, the movie shifts from a story about either Gelsomina or Zampano, and becomes a narrative tracing the path of loneliness. It attaches to and follows each character for a time until exhausting that soul, killing it, and moving on. Much like the nuns who move from convent to convent avoiding attachment to worldly things; Zampano avoids this too, and leaves a trail of spiritual debris in his wake.The film is nicely framed by three encounters on the beach, each representing the narrative shift -- Gelsomina; then Gelsomina and Zampano; and finally Zampano alone. Every pebble has a purpose. But if enough time (seawater) passes over the pebble it will be crushed, lose its identity and its meaning. In the end he is crying, clutching the pebble's waste.",

Thus, Gelsomina is the greatest character ever walked on the silver screen - so carefree and joyful, yet so complex. No other actress could have to turn out such a layered character with such subtle nuances. Of course, Giulietta Masina's peculiar beauty helped a lot. Such a character can only be supported by an equally strong and morally complex character and that Anthony Quinn's Zampano is. Not a nasty or a bad man by default, but someone who knows what he is doing wrong, yet he can't get things going straight. He is capable of cruel things, but after he, although trying to find excuses, still feels regret, and blames himself.'La strada' (The Street) is exactly the kind of movie that only Federico Fellini is capable of making. While his contemporaries were known for (neo)realistic movies, the Fellini created magical realism and that 'La strada' is - a realistic voyage of traveling artists through the magic of creativity.

            "content": "In this film, Giulietta Masina is a better female comic than Lucille Ball, a more pathetic character than Charlie Chaplin's Poor Soul, and a more bemused individual than Stan Laurel. As Gelsomina Di Constanzo she is simply spectacular. Her eye movements and facial expressions lead the viewer to laughter one moment and pathos the next. In keeping with the classical tradition of comedy, she starts out with romantic idealism only to continually flop into morose realism as she tries to experience life on the road. She is forced to deal with a vindictive Zampano (Anthony Quinn)and a malicious Fool (Richard Basehart), armed only with the inexperience granted a poor girl sold by her mother. She wants to fit in, yet can she ever? This is all foreshadowed in the opening scene on the beach constructed much like Picasso's Expressionistic \"Tragedy.\" The Left Elbow Index consider seven elements of film--acting, plot, production sets, dialogue, artistry, film continuity, and character development--on a scale of 10 for very good, 5 for average, and 1 for it needs help. Without question, Masina's acting is superb, which towers over a cast of excellent actors acting excellently. More of the same in other films would have been an special theatrical gift. The plot is also above average, most likely because it incorporates a good story, but also because it contains a never ending element of suspense. What indeed will happen to Gelsomina? The production sets are average. One can only do so much with the outdoors in post-war Italy. So with the artistry in the film, although the camera angles are helpful. Film continuity suffers from the confusing relation of action and scene in places, but the attentive viewer can work around this. The dialogue is above average, even the shouting scenes are not too disruptive. That of the haggling scene is good, and The Fool recalls Shakespeare. Character development is far above average with recognition occurring as Gelsomnia has one experience after another. She tries to fit in, and succeeds to one degree or another. The LEI average is 7.85, raised to an 8 (which equates to a 10 on the IMDb scale)based solely on the toothpick scene. This film is extraordinary for 1954, and one would think that it marked a beginning of good film making. There is a bushel of very good films since, but the trend is away from such excellence resulting in a trainload of much, much poorer movies. Unfortunately, it seems, all art is not evolutionary. I strongly recommend this film. It is mandatory to see the Italian version, for even with subtitles it is far superior to the dubbed English cuts.",

Not a type of acting I'm used to seeing, and it took me awhile to warm up to it. She plays a very gentle but devoted innocent. Anthony Quinn gives an award-worthy performance as a tough, violent strong man who buys Gelsomina from her destitute mother and treats her almost as a slave, even though she would do most anything to please and comes to love him. Basehart is also great playing the acrobatic clown who enjoys making fun of the strong man, and teaches Gelsomina about life.

Sad but beautiful LA STRADA is one of Fellinis greatest movies (if not the best one). Gelsomina is a great, fun and charming character (what a amazing actress by the way, shes like Italian Charli Chaplin or Harpo Marx) and unlike people often mistake she is *NOT* retarded but a simple person unfamiliar with the evils of the world, but full of wonder and thinking with her hearth. I strongly recommend this movie to any fan of good cinema!Im just sad that they don't do movies like this any more... to bad!",

La Strada is the story of Zampano (Anthony Quinn), a traveling showman and Gelsomina (Giulietta Masina), a girl with a kind of mental retardation as his assistant.to me, the film alludes to contrasted but dear childish qualities in the characters; Gelsomina is the example of naivety and innocent goodness, Il Matto (the fool) is the kind, free spirited but often irresponsible kid, and Zampano, eventually reveals himself as a guilty, saddened and helpless soul after his brute shell breaks down in the aftermath of a tragic realization. in many cases, the scenes in La Strada are a success thanks to the music by Nino Rota which is pretty remarkable here.La Strada is like a road film made in Fellini's way. the characters are too clouded in their mind and have no clue where their happiness lie or how to go about achieving it. they just keep searching in the road, but they are destined to fail. at the end, Gelsomina is lonely and Zampano is restless.on of my complains about the film is that i think Gelsomina's innocence was too deliberate and obvious. she has a type of expressionistic, silent clown influence, glaring enough that it becomes distracting; maybe the conception or the writing of the character is responsible, or maybe it was the actress, but had Gelsomina been subtle, it would've certainly elevated the film for me as a whole. another of my complains is that the first half is too slow and it took much time for me to be involvedFellini's direction here is intimate, and the setting seems unpremeditated, which, i think, can be thought of as pointing to the absurdity of life; the tendency for it to be meaningless and random, a theme that was present also in I Vitelloni.",

This may be my own feminism getting in the way, but I did not understand how Gelsomina's family could basically sell her off to such an aweful man - and Gelsomina remain calm!   I did not find her character to have much emotion at all.   The character of Zampano on the other hand displayed a lot of emotion.  It is ironic though because Zampano is supposed to be a \"manly man\", one who does not show his emotion.Watch something else.",

Manana (sorry for lack of tilde, but I'm not wasting time looking for how to do that)is a cognate from Spanish, along with no, and a couple others which escape me now.I got close to the end which NY foodie says is totally gripping in the last 30 minutes, but I found it much less so, at least without the dialog. I gave up.Caveat: I am a person who loves dialog, pretty much despises action unless it has a ton of character development that makes me be invested in the people. So, I may not be your best bet for a reviewer without any intelligible dialog.I just couldn't finish it, but I may have cheated myself.I'll keep trying to find subtitles, but this is a five year quest that seems to be completely fruitless.Much appreciation to anyone who can guide me to an English version.",

I must say that I was surprised by how melancholic and sad it is. It reminded me of a Neo-Realistic movie for its scenes set in the city suburbs amongst people who struggle to carry on in every day life. Of course, other Fellini's movie had also these kinds of setting, but the Italian director paints his portrait of provincial Italy with more sad and crude hues, helped also by Gelsomina's melancholic recurring trumpet music theme, written by the great Nino Rota. However you can still see the Fellinesque style in \"La Strada\", for example in the irony in the scenes of the argument between Zampan\u00f2 and the crazy guy. The circus certainly is another typical Fellini subject, present in many of his works. Overall a good movie but definitely not one of his best.",

Not many filmmakers have a touch delicate enough to handle such matters without sentimentality or clich\u00e9'. He is very honest and sincere. Anthony Quinn is terrific as Zampano. Guilietta Masina is adorable as Gelsomina. Richard Baseheart is very convincing as the Fool who can't help but be a fool. Felini is very sympathetic towards his characters.

You might give it 7/10.My Critique (warning: spoilers likely)\nI would like to put aside the whole Italian Neorealism agenda and this film's role in the Transition period of Italian film. That is worth your time to go study on your own. Context is an important way of understanding this film in the Fellini's body of work.Instead I was struck by the themes of this film. The three main characters standing for mind, body, and soul. Il Motte (The Fool), Zampano (The Strong Man), and Gelsomina (the naif), respectively.\nThe snarky treatment that comes from the fool toward Zampano parallels the post WWII marxist intelligentsia's anti fascist narrative. I propose the Fool's snark and clever wit echos a patronizing contempt for the working man. The anti fascist intelligentsia believes they know better what the working man needs as if their movement is some messianic moral blowback against Mussolini's fascist ideals.In 2020 America we are facing these themes as well. An American progressive intelligentsia is alienating the common man by condescension and patronizing superiority. The consequence of this disrespect is outright rejection and the conservatives going off the rails to extreme positions at the hand of an anti-democratic movement on the far-right.In the movie, the character of The Fool humiliates Zampano (the common man) during his performance. He also lures away the attentions of Gelsomina (the Soul) when he tries to bring her into his act. This erupts into Zampano attacking the Fool and getting himself thrown in jail.\nThe soul is torn between these two. Infatuated with the Fool (mind) and duty bound to care for Zampano, because otherwise he'd be alone. The Fool introduces the reasoning that a pebble must have a purpose even if we don't know what it is. This forms the foundation she needs to see her devotion to Zampano as a spiritual mission.The Fool's behavior ultimately results in his death at the hands of Zampano. The Fool is incapable of respecting the common man. Taunting him at every opportunity, ultimately he's killed accidentally by Zampano's rage.The murder destroys the soul. She goes crazy mourning the senseless killing. Ultimately, Zampano cannot handle her grieving and must abandon the soul.The final scenes ties up his unconscious love for her, jealousy that she admired the Fool. The film ends in his torment.That's pretty profound stuff. How much I've projected onto Fellini's intent isn't clear to me. All art is part the viewer's experience and artist's. In 10 years I will have a different take.It left me wanting more films from Fellini. I look forward to seeing every film he crafted.",

            "content": "One of Fellini's purest films. Never less poetic than let's say \"Otte E Mezzo\" ('63) or \"Il Casanova\" ('76), but it's a more subtle and human piece in a way. It's smaller in scope and style, but with a lot of heart and soul. Fellini tells the story of a traveling entertainer called 'Zapan\u00f3' (memorably played by Anthony Quinn) and the girl he bought to 'assist' him in his life and act, called 'Gelsomina' (a magical performance by Guiletta Masina). The film is a depiction of their life on the road. It's about 'man and woman', love, the human condition and it's painful complexities. In essence it's a film about the mysteries of our human emotions; uncontrollable and tragic. Or even more to the point: a film about a man who's heart is opened by the loss of his true love.'Zapan\u00f3' sees himself as a true artist. In need of his freedom to 'be'. Raw, uncompromising, tough, but totally not in touch with his inner-feelings. He's kind of a brute, without any room for the sentimentality's of life. He often screams that 'he needs nobody'. But, he needs a partner. For his act, and also for social purposes. That's 'Gelsomina'. She's an almost mute, tragic, strange but lively character. Emotional and sad, but also a clown. She's somehow 'connected' to 'Zapan\u00f3'; they seem to need each other in some sort of way. But, in the end - after a tragic incident whereupon she becomes too emotional an 'crazy' for the tough 'Zapan\u00f3' - he decides to leave her when she's sleeping. He never sees her again. Years later he finds out the sad truth about 'Gelsomina', and we see that he never forgot about her. He walks on the beach, in the dark, and remembers 'Gelsomina'. He starts to cry - very emotional. His epiphany. He's alone...By the way, my entire synopsis is fully interchangeable with Woody Allen's film \"Sweet And lowdown\" ('99). His homage to Fellini's \"La Strada\". Also filmmaker David Lynch calls \"La Strada\" his favorite Fellini film next to \"Otte E Mezzo\".",

It is also very Italian - intense passion, crude roughness and culture all rolled into one - Italy in a nutshell. Unfortunately for me the film was ruined by one thing and that is completely and utterly ruined beyond redemption and that thing was Gelsomina and her acting. The character appeared to have no depth or meaning whatsoever and are we supposed to find her amusing just because she makes funny faces and walks in a funny way. I need a bit more to a character than expression and gait and spent the whole film thinking someone should have really told her that she isn't Charlie Chaplin. She irritated me utterly. I tried to enjoy other parts of the film, which were good but just couldn't because I had to look at her, even when they appeared to be developing another aspect of the film it would then cut to a close up of her making some expression as though completely unaware that we had to watch these painful, over-acted, unnatural contortions, there was no escape. The truest line in the whole film was when she was told she had a face like an artichoke. I actually quite liked the other characters, Zampano included, not that maybe I liked them as people but as characters, cliched admittedly but at least they seemed to have some sort of meaning and authenticity about them and the fool even have something useful to say. They could have done Gelsomina so much better - either the oppressed woman powerless and basically sold into slavery, or the trapped women escaped to take on the free life of a gypsy rover; as it happened they tried both, did neither and any attempt was usually cut short by having to look at her funny faces and ridiculous gait. I don't know much about Chaplin but there must be something about him though I do wonder if this style is better left to silent cinema. All this combined with how they tried to develop the other characters both as individuals and as archetypes meant perhaps this film was trying to do too much which is in credit to its makers and of interest to professional critics and film students but to me just made it unenjoyable. It was a good premise and if they had done more in a Saragossa type style this could have been an 8/9/10 out of 10 film. As it was: 6/10",

Here, they are each treated with a sense of morbid tragedy, as the former lacks self-sufficiency and the latter is doomed to dissatisfaction and self-loathing. The two leads are exceptionally well-suited to their respective roles, with Masina exuding a wide-eyed naivet\u00e9 while Quinn brings forth surprising depth from his role, displaying at various points cold indifference, covetousness, and ultimately a consuming regret that forces him to recognize his own cruel nature. Those searching for the layers of subtext that Fellini interjects into his work so often will have a field day with this one, as the simplicity of its overall narrative allows for endless interpretation. More conventionally structured than his later films, La Strada shows the director/writer's strengths in pulling from personal experience to tug the heartstrings. (4/5)",

A slightly retarted girl is sold to an entertainer that drifts around streets looking for small crowds to impress people with his iron breaking trick. Gelsomina is not treated nicely as his assistant and she have more downs than ups during her time with Zampan\u00f2. When they come to a circus she meets up with a guy she has seen perform before. \"The Fool\" is very gifted and she likes this man way more than her companion. Naturally the two men argue and she is left pretty sad wondering what to do. People are always treating her bad and she kind of stick up with it - she does not know any better.\n\nThis film starts of pretty flat and boring. There is not much of a plot other than the things I mention, but something big happen after the first hour plus or so. This is when the film really gets better for me and I find it easier to enjoy this semi-bizarre film for it's qualities.\n\nFellini is not one of my favorites, but the three or four I have seen before this one has been good or great. This one is for me somewhere in the middle. I find it a bit overrated and very dated. Some cool transitions, some great shots, but a story with late development and to much repetition in a way - it feels dragged. As a whole and a total it helps a lot with the last 30 minutes or so, where both the characters and the movie change. At also stayed with me for a while - so you can say it's a grower. A good thing.\n\n7.5 out of 10 iron pieces stronger than steel.",

I can\u2019t say that I was ever bored or disengaged by the plot. Yet the film is painful because it\u2019s so hard to watch the struggles of the main character. She is so badly mistreated in every definition of the word, that I can\u2019t help empathizing with her. There are brief moments of lightness and gaiety, but oppression feels like it is always right around the corner. I know there are others who can watch this kind of film and appreciate the authentic realization of the human experience, and I can see why La Strada would be lauded for that accomplishment. I\u2019m simply not built to handle a film where the protagonist is constantly suffering. Also, as I mentioned in my review of A Streetcar Named Desire, this isn\u2019t the time in my life when I can find any entertainment in an abusive relationship. That being said, I still applaud the quality of La Strada. It is a well-constructed film and it has many elements that I\u2019d call great. Sadly, the whole package isn\u2019t appealing to me. ",

La Strada walks a tightrope between bittersweet and melodramatic, without ever falling off--a difficult balance Fellini manages well. Fellini's wife, Giulietta Masina, plays an impish female lead who contrasts with Anthony Quinn's brute. Both stars are captivating and highly appealing in their roles.",

La Strada is exactly that kind of movie. A brutish circus strongman takes on a faintly dimwitted woman-child. Neither of them are mental geniuses; no hyper-literate Aaron Sorkin rants here. But the basic universal themes of humanity run strong - the need for affection, security, respect, loyalty.\n\nLa Strada was Fellini's first break from the Neo-Realism that had dominated post-war Italian cinema. Zampano, Gelsomina and The Fool are not Everymen. They are dell'arte-ish archetypes thrust into a sad quest for survival in a poverty-stricken land. \n\nIn fact, if you watch this movie as a realistic portrayal of events, it will lose you from the opening scene. Gelsomina, the woman-child, comes home to find that her older sister has died in the slavery/employ of some brutish circus beast, the circumstances of her sister's death come with no explanation, and that she has been sold into similar slavery/employ of this same brutish circus beast. So right away, we have a handful of grievous moral problems that are never addressed in this movie. This is just the life these people lead, and no one questions it. Hopefully this is not a real world in which people actually live. It is more comforting to view it metaphorically.\n\nGiulietta Masina's performance is often compared to Chaplin, but I saw her much more as Harpo Marx, her clear, expressive face incapable of masking her moods, the picture of innocence, always reacting with utter honesty.\n\nIt was also interesting to see Richard Basehart, whom I only really had ever seen as the lead stiff in Voyage to the Bottom of the Sea, play such a lighthearted, effusive character.",

The movie moves around these three characters, although it does not leverage the filmography to explain or provide anything about them. Compare this, for example, with Bergman's masterpiece \"The silence\".\nThe only thing I can give credit to in La Strada is the depiction of the drama between brutish Zampano and naive Gelsomina. Denied several times by Zampano, a man without any ethical or humanitarian value. The movie depicts how the simplicity of Gelsomina forms gradually the affection in Zampano which eventually changes him for the better.",

Almost like a character from a Kurosawa film, he's both funny and brutal and right until the end we never exactly know if he's actually a good guy inside or why he just doesn't abandon Gelsomina.\n\nMuch of La Strada is a mystery, but the loose ends are, what it's essentially about. It's neither a melodrama nor a really character study, but just an excerpt of life, of a brute artist and a poor young girl who goes along with him for a certain distance. There's no tragic or happy ending, it just ends when their ways split again. I guess this is what life really looks like (at least more than Hollywood melodrama), the other thing is if I desire to watch a film about it.\nIf it has characters like Zampano, yes, give me more of it. With characters like Gelsomina I can live without these kind of films. La Strada, in the process, is somewhere in the middle - one brilliant character, an offbeat story but some very annoying details and of course Gelsomina as the big deal breaker.\n\nNevertheless, La Strada gets the old-master-bonus (which is the reason why I watched it in the first place) and you just have to acknowledge and admire Fellini's ability to play with comedy set pieces in this rather serious film.\nAlso, from what I've read, this is his most personal film and with some effort you can see references to his own life.",

The story is simple; daily existence for survival in a universe that does not care. The film suspends the viewer between the action of its characters and their stark environment and owes much to the black and white cinematographic technique of Otello Martelli and Carlo Carlini. Two scenes were particularly memorable to me; the first being the vast stretch of wind blasted wasteland surrounding the empty road as the two main characters, Gelsomina and Zampano, travel in their crazy motor caravan and the final scene with Zampano looking up from his drunken stupor on the sandy beach and recognizing the stars in the night sky for the first time but finding no place among them. This last scene is symbolic of man's separateness from the universe and his insignificance in it conveys more metaphysical horror than all of Bergman's films combined.",

The film has a direct exertion of pathos by coupling two disparate characters, an angelically miserable Gelsomina (Masina) and an uncivilised macho Zampan\u00c3\u00b2 (Quinn), which may not pander to the New Wave trend at that time, but time proves its longevity and flags the upcoming career flourish which would verify Fellini as one of the most creative and intelligent film auteur in an historical scope. \n\nLA STRADA has a starkly primitive settings for the always-on-the-wheel couple, the gypsyish, footloose lifestyle seems to be endless and bleak along with the melancholic tunes, Gelsomina\u00e2(TM)s hapless experience could melt any steel heart and her wide-eyed subservience is too heart-rending to even blame her; Zampan\u00c3\u00b2, on another level, is a far cry from an evil soul, merely is a man with rudimentary desires and an irascible temper. \n\n Giulietta Masina did an almost-perfect work to embody herself with all the ups-and-downs of a poor girl\u00e2(TM)s misadventure both inwards and outwards, her Chaplin-esque clown mimicry and antics have a genuine comedic infusion to the views and by comparison, Quinn\u00e2(TM)s chest chain-snapping stunt is over-used and outdated, but he has his own time, namely, the scenes of his final wail of grief are the salvation for him (a great solace for the audiences as well). Richard Basehart, his portrayal of \u00e2Il Matto\u00e2? is queerly vivacious, a sincere contrast to the adversity he would meet in due course. \n\nThe cameras work miracles too, for example, the night shots of tightrope-walking among crowds has its enchanting depth of focus. Although the world in LA STRADA is a period I could never experience, and it is a more straightforward tale compared with Fellini\u00e2(TM)s other oeuvres, but through the film I could potently sense a clear-minded manifesting of some most precious humility virtues which would also affect people under whatever conditions, to use a tear-jerking story to give hope, which is a marvelous achievement!",

            "content": "Federico Fellini was an undeniably strange and quirky filmmaker both in his work and his image he presented to the world. So it almost seems natural that of all the films he wrote and directed this one has the characters he claims he can relate the most too. He based the character of Zampano on a man who worked in castrating pigs in his hometown of Rimini, the man supposedly got around with the local woman and got a mentally deficient peasant girl pregnant before leaving town and her to her fate. Meanwhile the film's co-writer Tullio Peninelli had wanted to write a similar screenplay after seeing a man and a woman traveling alone by wagon through the mountains, wanting to tell their life on the harsh road. So the two were merged and La Strada was born, filmed in various locations throughout Italy, winning the Academy Award for Best Foreign Film and being cited by Fellini as the film he felt the closest too. Though perhaps an obscure part of world cinema the film has made a mark in the musical world as well being cited as an influence and inspiration for Bob Dylan's \"Mr. Tambourine Man\", and the Kris Kristofferson penned hit \"Me and Bobby McGee.\" So many years later how does La Strada really hold up though? A moving work or pretentious fluff? Let's take destined to die young look.\r\n\r\nOur film is about brutish Zampano (Anthony Quinn, a really effective career defining performance and one often unfairly overlooked) a traveling circus strongman with a shady past who after buying a girl named Rosa for his assistant has returned to her hometown a year later with Rosa dead to buy her sister Gelsomina (Giulietta Masina, Fellini's wife who gives an equally moving but far different performance). Though she is a simple peasant girl suspected of having problems in the mind her mother accepts some money and sends Gelsomina on the road with Zampano to present and be a part of his act. Gelsomina has a childlike personality and though she is happy and curious at first quickly grows miserable with Zampano a horrible drunk and womanizer. She finds herself strangely attached to him however amidst all the trials of their relationship and the life they lead including being kicked out of a circus, encountering sad lonely people and eventually a horrible murder to terrible to handle.\r\n\r\nWhat really amazes me about this movie is how fucking tragic it is, I mean there is nothing bittersweet or know hard lessons learned or anything at the end of this film it just cuts out on a world of bleak and utter despair. It's hardly the first tragedy but the heartbreaking destitute ending is certainly ballsy at a time where Hollywood was still making such upbeat optimistic films. As with a lot of Fellini's film the directing is excellent and top notch for its day, but though it has some strange imagery its much more rooted in terra firma than a lot of his other films lacking that dreamlike quality and in many ways making it a perfect starting point for Fellini newcomers. The performances main and supporting are all incredibly effective, especially Quinn who I'd argue gives the central performance and is especially incredible as Italian is not his first language. The story meanwhile is masterfully structured, La Strada is translated in English to the road and this movie effectively documents the trials and tribulations of a base, talentless one trick pony and his unfortunate and far too curious and big hearted assistant as the road and vagabond lifestyle breaks them down physically and emotionally until they are no more and than claims them body and soul. Perhaps a bit too late to be considered truly timely or relevant La Strada is still an effective and resonant story that can be related to all willing to give it a try and offers a glimpse into a world unfamiliar to American audiences than and now.\r\n\r\nI loved La Strada, I think it's a really underrated masterpiece and it may not be the best but it remains my favorite Fellini film I've seen. I could find hardly a flaw in the entire film and it didn't feel dated in story or film-making in the slightest I found myself incredibly drawn into the whole well put together affair. Whether a fan of Italian cinema, Fellini in general or just plan movies I see no reason not to enjoy it and can't recommend the film highly enough if nothing else than for screen legend Anthony Quinn's greatest performance as Zampano and the gut wrenching incredibly moving ending. I can perhaps imagine the type of person this just wouldn't work for but I wouldn't want to be friends with them.",

It's the pretension of those future works that annoys me more than this one specifically: Fellini shows signs of talent here, and he eventually ripened as a director, and, yes, for the 1950s, this is pretty outstanding.  I've simply far exceeded my tolerance for the stupider siblings of this kind of work.

Shock, depth, vividness, boldness, integrity, and rounded skill are not achieved through sophomoric scripted trifles masquerading as thought-provoking moments.  Also, every good movie starts with a good script, but the script is not the end of production.  For a complete guide to proper moviemaking, see \"Godfather\" and \"Godfather II.\"",

            "content": "Such an amazing film. Federico Fellini's first true landmark film, La Strada, established him as one of cinema's great directors almost immediately upon its release. The happy-go-lucky Gelsomina (Giulietta Masina) walks along the beach, where she is dragged back home by her young sisters. She learns that her older sister has died, and that she must take her place as assistant to the gruff, brutish Zampano (Anthony Quinn), a street performer who presents one simple trick that has gone utterly stale, but makes a living and that's all he cares about. While on the road, Zampano treats Gelsomina like dirt, yet they grow an attachment which only becomes apparent when it is too late. I adore this film's cinematography, which possesses some sort of greatness that I can't put my finger on. The acting is superb, Masina with her adorable facial expressions and naively optimistic manner, Quinn with his uptight, ape-like personality which is notoriously mocked by Richard Baseheart, \"The Fool\". All the rest of this masterpiece's charm, accompanied by Nino Rota's score which is as always, excellent makes this one of my favourite films.",

            "content": "Translated as \"The Road\" this title makes more sense than you would think at first. It's not a road movie in the American vein, young people finding freedom and the big expanse of life. But it is a story of carnival performers on the road, and we see the landscape all over post-war Italy.If you haven't seen Italian movies from this period, or any other Fellini, you might have to adjust to a couple things. One is a lack of totally clear plot. It does make sense, but it will jump along in little episodes that seem incidental. I think what this means is that the important things in life are incidental, and that it brings the viewer into the ordinary flow of these two or three lives. There is a touch of surrealism now and then, which adds to the strange feeling. The photography is simple but beautiful enough, and the scenery, every changing, adds to the sense that we are sweeping across a whole time to capture it and make it cohesive. The sound is odd, all dubbed in later (voices and musicians playing instruments, everything), and it is so obviously out of synch it again makes the experience dreamlike and bizarre. If you can't get used to that you might just write it off as low-budget.\nOf course, avoiding the main point until the end, this is a movie that gets into your heart. It's about a mean man and a sweet submissive girl who ends up being his wife, by default. Neither is a paradigm of movie beauty--Anthony Quinn at his roughest as Zampano, a circus strong man, and Giulietta Masina a tiny Gelsomina with a mime-like face that makes her the sad clown of the movie, very sympathetic. By the end, when Zampano is still seemingly unredeemable, we follow his every move and every twitch on his face because we are drawn into the tragedy of his life, even though it seemed avoidable all along. He's just that uncouth, untamed kind of man, and as much as he deserved to be made fun of (as another character does), he receives the empathy of Gelsomina.If you can step into the style and go with the odd flow of the scenes, you might find this a flawless film. Sometimes the best art is idiosyncratic, as this is. There are no inconsistencies, the feeling of the movie evolves and is fully grasped all through, and we are allowed to watch with wonder and understanding. Because we have seen these people before, in parts, and in ourselves. That's why it matters.",

            "content": "\"La Strada\" is in Federico Fellini's top five best movies for me, as well as Giulietta Masina's best performance in his movies so far. Sweet and naive Gelsomina (Masina) is born in a poor family, and in a desperate attempt to get ten-thousand lire, her mother sells her to rough circus performer Zampan\u00f2 (Quinn). Gelsomina hates him, but she enjoys the circus life, and appreciates all that her owner has taught her. When the two are picked up by a bigger deal circus, Gelsomina meets Il Matto (The Fool) (Basehart) and after a few meetings, she falls for him. Too bad the triangle brings doom for the three. \"La Strada\" is one of Fellini's masterpieces, and since I prefer his black-and-white '50's films to his strange '60's and later surrealist movies, I knew I had to see this movie considering how many few \"normal\" movies he has. Truly, this is one of his most memorable movies. The message, the score, and especially the cinematography capture the essence of everything this movie is about, and Fellini does not make anything in this movie un-enjoyable or trite. Masina has been called the female Chaplin for how she uses facial expressions and body language to show what she is trying to say, and indeed she does this and makes a very very touching performance, and outdoes the rest of the cast (even though Quinn and Basehart are superb) just by doing her role so subtly. No matter what, you can feel the emotions that she presents, and in the meantime gives us one of the most sympathetic performances of all time. The BAFTA nod is well deserved. \"La Strada\" is an excellent movie that is not only dark, but is one of the most touching films I've ever seen. Highly recommended.",

I don't want to give much away but there's conflict, a ship full of symbolism, and jealousy. It's not as surreal as Fellini's later works but it shows what is to come in 'La Strada' one of the master's greatest achievements in his post neo-realist stage.
