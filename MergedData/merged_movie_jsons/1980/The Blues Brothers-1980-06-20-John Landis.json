            "review_title": "They're On A Mission...",
            "content": "It started out as a bit on Saturday Night Live, and grew into probably THE most successful movie ever to have had it's genesis in that particular medium.  And who would've thought that a couple of character actor/comedians would emerge from an innovative four-or-five minute act as `legendary' bluesmen of their era?  Which is exactly what John Belushi and Dan Aykroyd did after first taking their show on the road as an opening act for the likes of Steve Martin, and then parlaying it into a feature length motion picture, `The Blues Brothers,' directed by John Landis.  When Joliet Jake Blues (Belushi) is released from prison, his brother Elwood (Aykroyd) is there to pick him up, in-- of all things-- a used police car.  And it doesn't bode well for this particular pair of out-of-work musicians, who on a visit to the orphanage in which they grew up discover that it is about to be shut down unless some taxes are paid on it, and soon.  But what can Jake and Elwood do to help?  They're broke.  Well, after a bit of pondering and a couple of good production numbers later, Jake sees the light (literally), and it all becomes perfectly clear:  They have to put their band back together and stage a concert, the proceeds of which should more than pay for the taxes on the orphanage.  It's a tough job, but somebody's got to do it, and don't tell Jake and Elwood it's not possible, because they're on a mission from God...\tIt's a fairly simple plot, told in a straightforward manner by Landis, who creates a visually stimulating and aurally satisfying movie that follows the adventures of the Brothers Blues as they travel around the good state of Illinois, seeking out the members of their former band and formulating their plan to save the orphanage.  Along the way they run afoul of a country/western band, incite the ire of some Illinois Nazis, ingratiate themselves to the diners in a classy restaurant, wreck an entire mall and generally wreak havoc wherever they go.  It's a total rush of excitement, backed with a blur of real blues, served up by some of the truly legendary performers of our time, like Aretha Franklin, James Brown, Ray Charles, Cab Calloway (doing his trademark `Minnie the Moocher') and John Lee Hooker. Not to mention the `band' itself, comprised of Steve `The Colonel' Cropper, Donald `Duck' Dunn, Murphy Dunne, Willie Hall, Tom `Bones' Malone, Lou `Blue Lou' Marini, Matt `Guitar' Murphy and `Mr. Fabulous' himself, Alan Rubin, all there to back the incomparable vocal stylings of Joliet Jake and Elwood Blues, who are determined to save their old home, now under the auspices of `The Penguin,' Sister Mary Stigmata (Kathleen Freeman).  But one question remains to be answered:  Who is Camille Ztdetelik (Carrie Fisher), and just what is she trying to do to Jake?\tWithout question, this was a great gig for Belushi and Aykroyd, who to millions of people ARE, and will forever be, the `Blues Brothers.'  And forevermore shall they be linked in the memories of anyone who has seen this movie, heard their records or caught their act on SNL.  Dan Aykroyd has gone on to have a successful and varied career in movies, including an Academy Award nomination for Best Supporting Actor (for `Driving Miss Daisy' in 1989), while John Belushi, of course, left us quite suddenly and way too soon, just as his career was on the rise.  Were they great singers?  Of course not; but they were accomplished performers who sagely surrounded themselves with the best of the best, a `band's' band that really made this gig work, because the music worked.  Add to that the energy, excitement and passion they themselves brought to it, and you have their formula for success, which can be measured by the strong following they still enjoy to this day.  And what a pity that Belushi isn't around to realize it.\tMemorable in supporting roles are John Candy as Burton Mercer (who uttered the unforgettable line, `Orange whip?  Orange whip?--); Henry Gibson as the steel-eyed head Nazi; Steve Lawrence, as agent Maury Sline; Charles Napier as Tucker McElroy, `Lead singer and driver of the Winnebago'; and Jeff Morris, who will always be remembered as Bob, owner of `Bob's Country Bunker,' the place with `both' kinds of music, Country `and' Western. \n\tThe additional supporting cast includes Steven Williams (Trooper Mount), Armand Cerami (Trooper Daniel), Layne Britton (The `Cheese Whiz'), Ralph Foody (Police Dispatcher) and John Landis (Trooper La Fong).  Also, watch for cameos by Paul Reubens (Waiter), Frank Oz (Corrections Officer), Twiggy Lawson (Chic Lady) and Steven Spielberg as the County Clerk.  A thoroughly entertaining and enjoyable movie, filled with memorable scenes and lines you'll be quoting for years to come (Aykroyd, in that `clipped' Elwood Blues delivery, to Tucker McElroy:  `We'll, ah-- we'll talk to Bob--'), `The Blues Brothers' is a great film-- not in the sense of a film that should have walked away with a bagful of Oscars, but great for what it is and for the special place it holds in the history of the cinema.  And, yes, it does have a place all it's own.  Because a movie doesn't have to be `Citizen Kane,' or `Gone With the Wind' to be `great.'  It's the ones that make you feel something for whatever reason, or make you laugh; the ones you remember because they're unique or have left their imprint on our culture in some way.  So, check `All of the above,' or add your own reasons.  For all that it's worth, this is the magic of the movies.  I rate this one 9/10.",

The plot of course has Jake (Belushi) and Elwood Blues (Aykroyd) on \"a mission from God\" to save the orphanage where they grew up. This necessitates reassembling their blues band and going on tour. By going on tour, I mean making a mess of everything. Whether it's their boorish behavior in a ritzy restaurant, the demolition of a mall, or an infinite number of car crashes, these guys are the bane of orderly society.Of course, the real star is the music. Making guest appearances are some of the twentieth century's most renowned artists. Ray Charles plays a music store owner, James Brown plays a preacher, Aretha Franklin plays The Soul Food Cafe owner, and there's many more. This movie reminds us why the blues remain an integral part of our national heritage. The big concert is probably the best example (especially with Elwood's crazy dance).Also appearing are Carrie Fisher as a woman out to kill Jake, John Candy as the police chief chasing them, Henry Gibson as an Illinois Nazi out to get Jake and Elwood after a most unusual encounter, and Steven Spielberg as the Cook County Clerk. All in all, this is one movie that won't disappoint you. Because everybody needs some movie to love (some movie to love/some movie to love). It needs you, you, you...",

            "content": "The Blues Brothers is definitely in my book one of the best comedies of all time. I couldn't believe my eyes that this film is not on the top 250, well, John Landis doesn't get enough credit in all. He brought us the most memorable comedies of all time: An American Werewolf in London, Trading Places, Animal House, and Kentucky Fried Chicken. He brings us The Blues Brothers, two popular characters off of Saturday Night Live who were at the height of their popularity. John puts them in Chicago(this is the best Chicago movie to watch next to Ferris Bueller by the way)and makes this into one of the greatest comedies ever. The great thing about this film is it's not gross out, it's not the obvious silly humor, it's just humor that keeps you laughing every minute. Dan and John are such a great comedic duo, they are without a doubt the most memorable duo off of SNL I would say.Jake and Elwood go to the orphanage where they were raised and learn that it is being shut down due to insufficient funds, so they want to reunite their band and put on a show to help save the place. On a mission from God they claim, they gather up their old band members to put on the show of the decade! But along the way, Jake and Elwood get into quite a bit of trouble with the police, the Illinois Nazi party, a girlfriend of one of their band members, and a girl who just seems to keep going after them and wants them dead.With great and endless cameos from great people like Aretha Franklin and Ray Charles, terrific Chicago landmarks, endless hilarious jokes, The Blues Brothers is the perfect comedy that is one of the best movies of all time. The concert scene is unforgettable and the scene that will always get me down on the floor in tears is where they go to the restaurant, John's line of \"How much for your women?!\" was just too priceless! You really have to see this movie, I guarantee you, you will die of laughter.10/10",

There are songs throughout, including one by Aretha Franklin that will live forever. The choreography is terrific, and, of course, there are only two Blues Brothers, John Belushi and Dan Aykroyd. It doesn't matter what their reason is for doing what they do. They have determined they are on \"a mission from God.\" Belushi was such a genius, though a troubled performer. Aykroyd was not nearly so gifted but played a very nice straight man to Belushi's insanity. We are slipping away from an era that provided us with some of the most memorable comedians we will ever see. This was a vehicle to bring much of that to fruition.",

            "content": "I couldn't tell you how many times I've watched this. I can say truthfully that me and my father have sat down and seen it together for over ten years. And I can assure you, it never seems less enjoyable. Every scene(honestly, find me a single one that should be taken out, and I will be utterly baffled) is great, and holds something to look forward to, most even something to reference and quote. The acting of the band members, and possibly some of the musicians(though, for my money, they do pretty darn good jobs), aren't necessarily the best actors, but it's seldom that obvious or annoying, and, come on, what kind of performance are you looking for in them in this, a role to take on, or some fantastic music? This is a movie that should be viewed by anyone who loves one or more of the following: Blues, car chases(this held the record in the number of vehicles crashed in a film, until, I believe, it's less impressive sequel), Aykroyd, Belushi, Landis and their work and comedy, all three shine. Heck, no matter what, this is likely to entertain you, thoroughly, continually and masterfully. The pacing is amazing, off the charts action and speed, yet it never, for a second, overwhelms or leaves you exhausted from it, and this has the rather important \"buffer\" portions, where you can relax. The script and plot are excellent. The songs are well-chosen, well-done and set up well. Brown, Charles and Franklin are incredible in this, with very different pieces. The cinematography and editing are spot-on. There is a little language, and it does get harsh. There is no real eye candy, this doesn't stoop to that for more than possibly a few seconds. The Collectors' Edition DVD holds 18 minutes of new footage, of varying quality, but I'd say it's worth attention of those who already dig the film. It also has a theatrical trailer, cast and crew listings, production notes and a making of. I recommend this to anyone, especially those who are either already familiar with(and into) the kind of tunes it's packed with, or those not, who are open to them. 10/10",

True the plot is pretty skimpy, but there is so much that compensates. The Blues Brothers is beautifully filmed, is confidently directed once again by John Landis and the script is very funny. Other than the delightful cameos from music legends such as Aretha Franklin, Cab Calloway and James Brown, the Pinto scene with the fall from the sky and the spectacular car chase(ludicrous I know but spectacular too) with the massed forces of the law and order, a country and western band and a bunch of neo-Nazis, what makes The Blues Brothers is the music, it is absolutely brilliant, and the numbers it features in are particularly rousing. And then we have endearing performances from John Belushi, Dan Aykroyd and Carrie Fisher as well. In conclusion, people may argue that it is a mess plot wise, but I am past caring really with the music and performances as good as they are. 10/10 Bethany Cox",

            "content": "What is this film about?It's a love-letter to Chicago, disguised as a road picture. In this case, Dan and John on an almost continuous journey around more Chicago locales than you can count on all of your available digits.It's a musical. Throughout the \"road trip\", the film exploits every opportunity to enlist so many musical legends (who find reasons to \"break out in song\"), that you probably won't be able to keep track of all of them, either.It's an excuse to throw in a long list of famous comedians, and other celebrities, strewn throughout the movie in bit parts, just for grins. (You should pay attention to almost every character that shows up along the journey, as virtually all of them are someone famous, e.g. even Twiggy shows up at one point.)It's an excuse to destroy, in unimaginably creative ways, an entire mall, and numerous other buildings, as a result of chases, vendettas, etc., just in case you need an \"action fix\" to \"round out\" the movie's musical and comedic experience. (A decent percentage of those destructive activities, perpetrated by Carrie Fisher's character.)There is a \"plot thread\" that provides an underlying reason for Dan and John's journey, but it's just there to facilitate all of the craziness. The journey is never boring (there's never time to get bored), and it is an awful lot of fun.I finally decided to review this, while watching the 2020 4K UHD release (which, as an aside, looks great). I would be remiss not to mention that it's a bit hard to watch the film, and not feel a hint of sadness, based upon the fact that 40 years on, from its original release, so many of the actors, musicians, and comedians it features, are simply not with us anymore. For some, that is simply a consequence of age, but there are far too many others that should have still been with us. The only silver lining is that we get to see why we enjoyed them, while we had them.I highly recommend this. It successfully melds so many film genres together into a single film, that it's almost impossible not to have fun.",

            "content": "A musical comedy action fantasy should not work, especially when one considers that it is the first SNL skit-to-screen adventure (which, history has shown us, is a decidedly mixed bag).  But this one does.  Two of the best car chases in cinematic history bookend the film, and in between there are show-stopping musical numbers, raw humor, Illinois Nazis, and a seriously disgruntled ex-fiancee.  And it all makes perfect sense in the context of the universe created by Aykroyd (who co-wrote), Landis (who directed), and Belushi (his barely contained zeal provides the battery pack for this film).Jake (Belushi) and Elwood (Aykroyd) are the former front men of a broken down blues band (actually a stunning collection of blues talent) which disbanded after Jake was arrested several years before.  Upon his release, he discovers that his boyhood orphanage home is about to be foreclosed upon for non-payment of property taxes.  Beaten up by a nun, sung to by James Brown, and touched by God, Jake sees the light and seeks to put the band together for one last show -- a charity benefit to save the orphanage.Their journey takes them from James Brown to Aretha Franklin to Ray Charles, John Lee Hooker to Cab Calloway.  The movie showcases the overwhelming talent of singers, musicians, and genres long out of vogue with popular musical tastes.  Indeed, this movie is a vehicle for giving these performers a chance to shine -- to bring their music back to the masses and ultimately into pop-culture immortality (to go along with their more prestigious musical immortality).This film is guaranteed to make you tap your feet, laugh out loud, gasp as both a mall and and entire fleet of Chicago police cars are destroyed, and believe in the magical powers of an old cop car.  Like I said, it's a musical comedy action fantasy.And it works.",

            "content": "From 1980, \"The Blues Brothers,\" starring John Belushi and Dan Aykroyd, is good for what ails you. It's funny and offbeat with great music and one of the all-time classic car chases thrown in. As one critic said, it shouldn't work. But it does. Big time.After musician Jake Blues (Belushi) is released from prison, and he and his brother Elwood (Aykroyd) visit one of the nuns (Kathleen Freeman) who raised them. She needs $5000 to pay taxes on the boarding school she runs. The boys want to help, even though she can slap a mean ruler on their knuckles, so they reassemble their old blues band and then attempt to find some gigs, even taking one at a country-western bar that isn't theirs. Just one problem. Everyone is after them, including the law, neo-Nazis led by Henry Gibson, the owner of the country-western bar where they didn't pay their bar bill, and a diminutive woman (Carrie Fisher) who tries to get them with bazookas, flame throwers, and whatever she can get her hands on. The musical artists in this film include James Brown, Ray Charles, Cab Calloway, and Aretha Franklin, and they're all fabulous, as is their music. The Blues Brothers band itself is terrific.Belushi and Aykroyd make a perfect pair. The funniest part for me was Belushi at one point begging for his life. Such a loss of talent. John Landis did a masterful job of directing what was in fact a multi- genre film that was in fact no genre at all, combining elements of comedy, musical, and action-adventure.What fun.",

THE BLUES BROTHERS is easily the best film collaboration with Dan (\"Dry White Toast\") Aykroyd, and John (\"4 Fried Chickens & A Coke\") Belushi. While it gets too overly far-fetched with the action plot, there is reason to sit back and chow down on the comical hilarity and nonsense thrills that only John Landis can master perfectly into a comedy.This is such a big deal after all because it offers a walloping combination of soul tunes, car chases, special effects, and crazy characters like female assassin Carrie Fisher and Nazi leader Henry Gibson. Put everything else together and you have one of the wildest experiences ever. If you want to know why it's so wild, the supporting cast of dancers, prison inmates, and law enforcers really shows that the movie itself is very hard at work! The music was supposed to be the main attraction in the first place, with real-life singers James Brown, Aretha Franklin, Ray Charles, and Cab Calloway. They add to the theme of this \"bluesy\" movie with their own style of performing familiar tunes. The real stars are Aykroyd and Belushi who can be both funny and talented on and off the stage. Probably the duo's all-time best performance is the singing numbers. But after the singing, we await the sudden amazement of car crashes and smashes that make up the excitement, with the largest impact ever since the 1974 cult classic GONE IN 60 SECONDS. It certainly has \"Made In Chicago\" stamped all over this picture! There are tons of entertaining moments that never go blind. Just sit back and watch it all go boom!Aykroyd and Belushi would have fared well in GHOSTBUSTERS had there been more movies produced, but this remains to be THE comedy classic for the wild SNL pair. DVD owners must not miss this one as it makes a valuable addition to your library. It's not really the masterpiece of a genius, but it is a good-natured effort in using different film genres in one complete package. Definitely recommended for Landis lovers out there.",

The action is over the top and utterly hilarious with countless cop cars, shop windows and even entire buildings being destroyed. This mayhem is regularly interrupted by musical interludes by the likes of James Brown, Aretha Franklin, Ray Charles and Cab Callaway. These songs are frequently accompanied by entertaining dance routines. As well as lots of well known singers there are also quite a few other well known people in cameo roles; the best being Carrie Fisher who plays the woman trying to kill Jake; I loved how it isn't explained why she is doing it till nearly the end. John Belushi and Dan Aykroyd are great as Jake and Elwood; two characters who almost never remove their sunglasses; even at night.

And those who saw it and did not like it... nope, that kind does not exist, at least for me. The one and only - Blues Brothers. There wasn't anything like this before or after this gem, not even close. This movie has everything - prison, drama, action, awesome car chases, one of the most exciting love stories ever shown on big screen, comedy, mass shooters, flamethrowers and explosions. And on top of that, it has legendary casting - Carrie Fisher, Henry Gibson, John Candy, Twiggy, Frank Oz (Yoda), even Steven Spielberg - and without competition, THE VERY BEST SOUNDTRACK IN HISTORY. John Belushi and Dan Aykroyd are heavily supported by James Brown, Cab Calloway, Ray Charles, Aretha Franklin, Steve Cropper, Matt Murphy, Chaka Khan, John Lee Hooker. For this movie 10/10 simply isn't enough.10/10",

After a trip to see the scary 'penguin', their ex-matriarch (Kathleen Freeman) they decide to reform their band to raise cash for their old orphanage.  Thing is, the members of their band are all doing other things like working in burger bars, as maitre d', and so on, and need to be persuaded.The best thing about this movie is the music, and this isn't just provided by the boys and their band, but by a number of guest appearances such as those of Ray Charles, Aretha Franklin, John Lee Hooker, and best of all, the great Cab Calloway.  The car chase sequences where a whole shopping mall and loads of police cars are destroyed is also brilliantly done.  There are lots of other goodies along the way, like the country club, the pseudo-Nazis, and of course, psychotic Carrie Fisher.  The sequel wasn't bad but this is the real McCoy.",

But some of them are just from planet Mars.People complaining about the music are just flaunting their own ignorance. No matter what else one might say about the movie, the music is terrific and anyone who says otherwise is just *wrong*. I'm on my second CD of the soundtrack because I wore out the first one. And it's not like I'm a particularly big blues fan, either, this is one of about three blues albums in my collection.People complaining about the comedy, well, I suppose comedy is a matter of taste. But I think the movie is hilarious. Nobody even mentioned one of my favorite gags: the last shot of Twiggy. :)But what I *really* want to respond to is a couple ridiculous claims that peoples' love of this film is in-genuine, that it's either a result of sheepish devotion to what they've been told is good, or else pure nostalgia for Belushi. That, my friends, is a first class CROCK. First of all, you'll never find *anyone* who's less go-along-with-what-the-crowd-says than me, and to be told that that's why I like the film, is so insulting, I could spit. And as far as Belushi nostalgia, also utter nonsense. If that were true, I'd love all the other Belushi films too, and in fact the only other one I really like is Animal House. Indeed, I consider Neighbors to be among the worst films I've ever seen.But for those who appreciate the Blues Brothers, I'll close with a tiny personal anecdote: Today I received a package in the mail, from some friends from Boston, who I used to be in a band with, and who I left behind when I moved to Washington. I don't really see or hear from them anymore, although I try to hook up with them on the rare occasions I get back to Boston. So I was surprised and delighted when I received this package.

Their disregard for the biggest problem is what provides the funny tone.Not that the movie is bad, far from it, but I believe that before watching I had high expectations that were not met, so maybe I was a little frustrated at the end of the movie.",

            "content": "So, I'm a fool.Why did I take so long to watch this movie?\"The Blues Brothers,\" is a delight, front to back and I don't just mean the sense of humor. The filmmaking is excellent. It's not \"Citizen Kane\" but throughout the film I found myself drawn into the production design, camera angles, and stunts.In fact, the moment I knew I would love this film is just one such moment. The film opens with one of the titular Brothers being released from prison. The huge doors open and a brilliant glowing light shines out from behind him symbolizing a rebirth or birth with the promise of his freedom. Of course today this would be a After Effects plug in that some one applied to a YouTube video but before Visual Effects this had to be done practically as a Special Effect. The work that goes into something like this, as well as the preparation to be ready at a certain time of day to catch the right quality of light in the right setting is fantastic. Seeing it made me realize that I was in safe hands. The makers of this movie were willing to work to make the film stand out.There are a thousand instances of this but the film does something else really smart that make it stick out in one's brain. They set things in relatable places.It makes everything seem more relatable and impressive. When it's time for a car chase, they don't go flying in and out of traffic and blowing red lights. Most of us never do that and don't relate to it. Instead, The Brothers are chased through a packed parking lot and then into a mall (a scene parodied countless times.)Now why is it that these scenes are famous? Because we have all been in a mall (though hopefully not driving) and zipping a round a mall parking lot is something we've all done. When the tires are squealing and we see a nice wide of a car turning up and down those asphalt aisles at too breakneck a speed we all know that WE would have hit those other cars. It highlights not only the skill of the drivers who put in the work to be able to reliably do this on camera, but also, the mystical nature of the mission they are on and the protection that God has placed around them.I hear people talk sometimes about the tragedy of Belushi's short career (I listen to a lot of comedy podcasts) and although it comes up less often than it used to, I always just assumed it was tragic in the way that any young death is tragic. I just didn't realize how brilliant Belushi was till I saw him perform. I won't get into it too much though because I believe you need to see his performances to understand.The energy of John Belushi is undeniable. His ability to take characters who should be unlikable and make them lovable and fun is tremendous. His understanding of comic timing is profound to the extent that it is extremely rare for a joke not to land. If you haven't seen him work you just won't understand and if you have seen his work, you do.It's that simple. You gotta see it.Speaking of brilliant performances, the music in this film is top notch. The best performers just doing what they do so well. Aretha Franklin, James Brown, Cab Calloway, Ray Charles, and I'm sure a bunch more that I don't recognize or know pepper this film with music and fun in a way that I just wasn't expecting. I mean, I knew there would be music. It is called \"The Blues Brothers\" but I wasn't expecting a film with so much music and of such a quality that it could be called a Musical, but it is. Just not the kind of musical we are accustomed to.I could write all day about this film but I do believe that this one people should just watch. It's one of the highest compliments I can give a film that I only want to watch it and not talk too much about it. I feel like my words can't come close to describing what was a truly wonderful film.PS- Writing this review made me want to watch it again so much that I did, lol.",

This gives the movie a feeling of\nwatching a films Broadway musical, and indeed this would be\na great candidate for the great white way. Callaway gets to\nrepeat his classic, \"Minnie the Moocher\", and Franklin gives\na terrific musical performance in her big production number,\n\"Think!\" then, there is their interaction with a group of\nmodern neo-nazis whom they deal with in a hysterical manner\nbut create enemies that, along with federal officers, follow\nthem through the conclusion of the film.There are several hysterical car chase\nsequences, usually ending up with dozens of police cars\ncrashing into each other or crashes to shopping centers,\nstreet closures, and that terrific finale where Nazi Henry\nGibson gets a hysterical confession from one of his cohorts\nas they fly off a freeway with the huge top of the Sears\ntower at eye level of them. Usually Chase sequences like\nthis take place in either Los Angeles, New York or San\nFrancisco, but this is the first where I actually got to see\na lot of the Windy City, nicely represented in this scene\nthat will keep you glued and possibly even rewinding to see\nthe action all over again.My only issue with this movie is its\nextreme length, two and a half hours which is probably 45\nminutes too long for a film of this nature. But what's it\ncut? It would be difficult for me to make that decision if I\nwas the film editor, so the faults has to lie in the hands\nof the screenwriter who put too much into the original\nscript and too much of it too good for someone else to want\nto chop it out. In spite of its Great Lengths though, I\nfound it moved pretty fast and when 2 and 1/2 hours were up,\nI felt that it only seemed about 15 minutes too long, not\nrealizing how much time had actually passed. Too much of a\ngood thing can be overwhelming, but for some reason this is\none of the rare exceptions to where it works even though\nsome people might be put off by viewing its length before\nthey invest in the time spent watching it.",

After all, SNL, Animal House and The Blues Brothers album were all huge. Belushi was suddenly the star of the week's top-grossing film, top-rated television show and singing on the number-one album all at the same time.Universal won and what they got was a new writer in Aykroyd who wrote a long script that director John Landis was still writing and didn't have a final budget until well after shooting started, at which point Belushi was already going wild in Chicago, drinking and drugging up a storm while cars were crashed everywhere and money was pretty much set ablaze.It doesn't matter. This movie is still remembered long after its star and all that money has gone away.Raised in an orphanage and taught the blues by Curtis (Cab Calloway), the brothers became blood when they cut their middle fingers with a guitar string from Elmore James, the King of the Slide Guitar.The past is important in this film, as Aykroyd demanded Calloway, James Brown, Ray Charles and Aretha Franklin to be cast and get musical numbers. Universal wanted younger acts and disco stars. They lost.The story is simple. The brothers want to raise money to save their orphanage. That's it. That's the story. The rest is a road movie full of comedic scenes that you can basically come into any time that you want.They could have filmed what happened during the making of the film and had just as great of a film. For example, there was an entire bar on set, The Bles Bar, staffed with drug dealers. And on one night shoot, Belushi disappeared. Aykroyd looked around and saw a single house with its lights on. He walked over and the owner of the house said, \"You're here for John Belushi, aren't you?\" He had walked into their home, asked if milk and a sandwich, and went to sleep. This is why he was nicknamed \"America's Guest.\" Belushi was also called \"The Black Hole\" because he would lose his sunglasses after nearly every scene.Beyond Paul Reubens, Steven Spielberg and Carrie Fischer, there's a secret Colleen Camp cameo. Look for her Colleen Camp's Playboy poster on Ellwood's hanging up in a scene.I remember this movie running so many times on HBO in my youth and watching it nearly every time. I could watch it right now, even after watching it to write this.",

So they try to get the band back together.My review: This movie is very long and very slow, but the slowness actually helps it for some reason. The direction is excellent and looks beautiful and the music is very good. The plot could have done with some tuning up, but if you think about it, this film is kind of a setup to show the wonderful singing talents of Aretha Franklin, Ray Charles, James Brown, Cab Calloway and even Belushi and Aykroyd. As for action, this film is full of it. There's more explosions and car chase scenes that most action flicks. So, I do recommend this musical comedy to all! my rating: 3 out of 4. rated R for language. 133 mins.",

Even excluding Directors' Cuts, etc., half the DVD reissues I see have noticeable changes. Many are minor, but much too often they're substantial and ruin the movie for me.The Blues Brothers DVD has substantial edits, but they make the movie better. Cuts made to shorten total run time -- four or five complete scenes, many small snippets, and some longer snippets -- are restored. Nothing was cut from the VHS version. The soundtrack is remixed in a few places; to my ear the original was better. Some restorations add little to the movie, but none make it worse. Most of the restorations enhance the movie, adding humor or rounding out the story. Best of all are the restorations, small but noticeable and pleasing, to performances: more James Brown, John Lee Hooker, Good Ole Boys, and the Brothers. Alas, no more of Aretha, Ray, or Cab. We can't have everything.To top it off, the \"Making Of\" documentary alone, with the back story of the Blues Brothers (the characters and in real life), and the birth and making of the movie, makes the DVD worth getting",

            "content": "After being released from prison, Joliet(John Belushi) rejoins his brother, Elwood(Dan Aykroyd) and while they are attending a Holiest Church \"sees the light\" and decides that they must \"get the band back together\" in order to raise 5 thousand bucks to keep an orphanage up and running. Things get complicated which could thwart their plans to raise the needed cash, but The Blues Brothers will find away because \"they're on a mission for God.\" One thing's for certain, a LOT of property and vehicles will be damaged/destroyed along the way, particularly in the climax as Joliet and Elwood must outrun the law enforcement, an angered country music band on tour in their Winnebago, and a group of disgruntled Illinois Nazis! Yep, Chicago and the outskirts of the city will lend itself to quite a few \"vehicle skirmishes\" as the Blues leave much destruction in their wake, with no mall, street corner, or highway safe. Director John Landis proves here he can sure develop impressive musical set pieces and has some talented performers(..like James Brown, Aretha Franklin, and Ray Charles just to name a few)to work with. You could say that The Blues Brothers was a precursor of sorts to Landis' masterpiece, Michael Jackson's Thriller.But, the movie seems to live and breathe on the Blues Brothers evading those out to get them with cars of all kinds driving through buildings and windows, as if you were watching some sort of implausible live-action loony toons cartoon with adults instead of artistically rendered animals. I've never seen so many police cars stockpiling on top of each other. Between this and Smokey and the Bandit, I can just imagine the millions spent on vehicles purchased just for wildly orchestrated stunts where they are used primarily as bumper cars. And, the inclusion of the foxy Carrie Fisher as a vengeful young woman out to kill Joliet for reasons we discover towards the end, including one dynamic sequence where she detonates Elwood's minuscule apartment with walls and ceiling caving in yet the Blues escape unscathed! And, how could one not forget the attempts of The Blues Brother Band to win over a raucous bar full of hicks gathered to hear country music(..the only song they can come up with to appease the crowd is Rawhide!). Under the suit, tie, hats, and dark shades, Belushi and Aykroid, are understated as can possibly be considering the hi-jinx that result from their choices, and it's because of this clash between their behavior and the madness around them that really makes the movie work. The Pinto scene where Henry Gibson and one of his Nazi followers fall from a high distance in the sky is a riot(..particularly the landing!)as is the sequence where the Blues finally arrive at the bank in the hopes of paying for the orphanage, regarding the fate of their long-suffering car. Marvelous musical number for Cab Calloway as he and the band members await for the Blues arrival from numerous hardships that kept them from getting to the theater on time for the concert. I definitely recommend, that is if you are like the one person who hasn't seen this as of yet, preparing to suspend disbelief because this movie is beyond the realm of realism. There are so many gags, you, I reckon, will always find something new when you watch The Blues Brothers.",

I practically loved how over-the-top the film was and how it managed to be so graceful and enjoyable. I liked the improbable car chases and I especially loved the musical numbers sung by nearly everyone in the film.John Landis, known for his excellent Animal House, directs a tale about the Blues Brothers. Joliet Jake has just been released from prison and he and his brother, Elwood decides to visit their old orphanage where they grew up. They found out that the place will close if they cannot raise five thousand dollars, so the bros decide to bring back the band together while being chased by cops, Nazis, and country singers.This film is led by the impeccable charms and chemistry of Dan Aykroyd and the late John Belushi. Both were incredibly funny, but none more so than Belushi himself. Then there was Carrie Fisher who is some mystery woman that existed to terminate Joliet Jake. Then there were soulful cameos by Aretha Franklin, Ray Charles, and James Brown.Overall, The Blues Brothers is an excellent, over-the-top cult classic. I really loved how at the end of the chase, there were just so many people after the Blues Brothers. I was laughing nonstop and I couldn't help but enjoy the action. The musical numbers were a blast as well. As it has been told, this movie is, \"on a mission from God.\" I rate this film 9/10.",

            "review_title": "Watched the Extended Version",
            "content": "Ah yes, another big budget comedy film. The first of these big budget comedy films that I reviewed was the 1979 film, 1941 which was directed by Stephen Spielberg and, funny enough, starred Dan Aykroyd and John Belushi. The Blues Brothers was released in 1980 and is based off of the sketch from Saturday Night Live. John Landis directed this film and has a massive cast that includes Dan Aykroyd, John Belushi, Carrie Fisher, John Candy, Ray Charles, Arethea Franklin, and James Brown just to name a few. The film had a huge budget but did manage do to make it all back in box office returns. The film itself is often considered one of the best comedies of all time. A sequel (of lesser quality) was made in 1998 called Blue Brothers 2000. Sadly, this is one of the last major films that John Belushi starred until his death in 1982 due to a drug overdose.The film follows Joliet Jake (who just got released from jail) and Elwood who are on a mission from god. They need to get $5,000 to help save an orphanage and to do that, Jake and Elwood are going to ge their old band back together and play a show that will hopefully raise the money needed to save the orphanage. Along they way, they meet several people (played by very talented musicians) and get into all sorts of trouble as they are constantly being pursued by the police, a cowboy band, Nazis, and Carrie Fisher.For the record, I watched the Extended Version of this film (but I have watched the Theatrical Version beforehand) which is included in the Blu Ray steelbook. But, with that being said, this movie is soooooooooo insane in the best way possible. The one comedy that I can compare this to is in fact 1941 which is a fine film but heavily flawed. (Do check out my review of it). This film is basically 1941, but flawless. Everything in this film is very memorable. From the acting, to the musical scenes, the characters, dialouge, humor, EVERYTHING!!! First of all, the acting is just amazing. You can really tell that everyone in this film is having a hell of a time in this film and they give so much life to the characters. I will forever remember Jake and Elwood and all of the people they meet along the way to their big concert. Some of the people they meet along the way are Ray Charles, Aretha Franklin, and James Brown just to name a few. Typically, I listen to rock music (mostly 90's rock) but I really do dig these rhthym and blues stuff. Again, the characters appear to have so much fun doing all this music and even the in movie audiences do too and even I as the viewer has a fun time watching these scenes. These scenes are very memorable to the point were if a music teacher is giving a lecture on blues music or oldies music, a clip from Blues Brothers is bound to be shown to the whole class. The humor in here works extremely well thanks to both John Belushi and Dan Akyroyd who give some pretty memorable lines and sometimes, doing absolutely nothing is just as funny! This film is fairly notable for its massive budget which was put towards the most insane scenes that I have ever seen in any comedy film. The big car chase scenes, all the car crashes, explosions, you name it! It is a spectacle that needs to be seen to be believed. It is something that blew my mind when I first saw this film and it still does to this day. It is hilarious and very entertaining. Sometimes a joke happens but in any normal movie it would not make sense. For example, when the Bluesmobile jumps the bridge. Obviously it is to steep of a drive to go up and is downright impossible to even jump the bridge. But this is not just a normal movie. That is where this film is at it's funniest and there are plenty of those scenes throughout this film.Blues Brothers is a very entertaining film that just needs to be seen to be believed. It does not matter which version of the film you watch whether it is the theatrical version or the extended version. But whichever one it is, once you watch this film, you will never forget it.",

            "content": "This movie merits classic status because it showcases five giants of American popular music -- Cab Calloway, John Lee Hooker, Ray Charles, James Brown, and Aretha Franklin. But by 1980, America's musical taste had been so pasteurized by disco and country (Bee Gees vs. Kenny Rogers) that these blues and R&B legends might have been relegated to a PBS documentary if it weren't for the admirable efforts of Dan Aykroyd and John Belushi to present their brilliance to a wider audience. To do that, however, they had to stitch together a knockabout comedy with a threadbare plot and loads of car chases which stops every 15 minutes or so for an awesome musical number. If that makes \"The Blues Brothers\" sound like an extended, excessive, extremely expensive episode of late-70s \"Saturday Night Live,\" well, surprise, surprise, that's exactly what it is. But between the sketchy schtick and the fantastic musical guests, \"The Blues Brothers\" is as loaded with entertainment value as a stuffed Chicago pizza is with calories, and both are equally satisfying.The plot, so to speak, centers on \"Joliet\" Jake (John Belushi) & Elwood Blues' (Dan Aykroyd) attempts to raise $5,000 for back taxes on the orphanage where they were raised. (Warning: the orphanage is run by the Catholic church. If you stop to wonder why a religious institution has to pay property taxes, you're really not going to get into the spirit of this thing.) They reassemble their old band, which fell apart after Jake went to prison, and embark on a lunatic journey across the greater Chicago area, destroying malls, alienating law enforcement and enraging Nazis along the way. You're distracted from the improbable storyline by director John Landis' gift for piling overkill on top of overkill, which in this movie even includes firebombs, machine gun fire and other pyrotechnics, most of it launched by a mysteriously enraged Carrie Fisher, who sleepwalks through this cameo like she's prescription-drugged into near catatonia (which she probably was). The comedy is broad but funny, and the Blues Brothers' numbers featuring Aykroyd and Belushi are surprisingly gritty considering the routine was always more about attitude that authenticity. But what elevates \"The Blues Brothers\" above the level of a well-made dumb comedy is its guest stars.Big kudos to scriptwriters Aykroyd & Landis for naming Jake & Elwood's backing ensemble the \"Blues Brothers Rhythm & Blues Band,\" a subtle acknowledgment that the Jake & Elwood characters always parodied more R&B (or, in the case of their \"Gimme Some Lovin'\" cover, phony R&B) than actual blues. They pay an even greater homage to bona fide electric Chicago blues with a scene featuring John Lee Hooker, performing his classic \"Boom Boom,\" that has absolutely no connection to the rest of the movie (but is, nonetheless, excellent). As for the rest of the musical guests, none of them are famous for blues -- Cab Calloway was a jazz singer, and Ray Charles invented the kind of gritty soul which James Brown and Aretha Franklin perfected. But if you're the kind of purist who lets these kind of distinctions ruin your fun, you should probably skip this movie and go hang out at Buddy Guy's Legends. The rest of us can enjoy Calloway as the Blues Brothers' mentor, Brown as a charismatic preacher, Charles as a blind, gun-toting music store owner and Franklin as a soul food restaurateur. As actors, Cab and Aretha do pretty well, Ray is commendable and the filmmakers were wise enough not to give JB any dialogue (his control-freak tendencies might have prompted him to rewrite the entire movie). But that's all just a bonus, since their musical numbers are the great highlights of \"The Blues Brothers,\" beautifully sung and enlivened by choreography that manages to look both polished and spontaneous. Aretha's version of \"Think\" is especially moving, since she's trying to convince her no-good husband, Matt \"Guitar\" Murphy, to stay on the straight and narrow and not take off with the Blues Brothers on their ridiculous adventure. She looks good, moves well and sounds just fine, even if she doesn't quite reach the high notes she hits in the recorded version. (But I'm going to assume that was her choice -- watch the credits and listen to what Aretha does with her throwaway line in the \"Jailhouse Rock\" number. Damn.) ReRe was in a career slump at the time and \"The Blues Brothers\" primed her for a return to superstardom. Nice work, Aykroyd & Belush.By the way . . . skip \"Blues Brothers 2000.\" It's pretty lame.",

            "content": "The Blue Brothers is one of the most odd films of the 1980's. The film carries itself with utmost grace and it is that grace and heart that saves the movie from going too bonkers. Filled to the brim with car chases from everyone ranging from a zillion cops to a plethora of neo-Nazis plus an array of song and dance numbers, the movie lives dangerously. It threatens to go way over-the-top, but the charisma of both John Belushi and Dan Aykroyd does the movie wonders. There are a huge amount of celebrity cameos that also add to the exciting fun this movie offers. Ray Charles as a soulful music shop owner, Aretha Franklin as a manager of a restaurant, James Brown as a preacher, and a whole bunch of non-music celebrity cameos.This film was directed by John Landis, whom previously worked with John Belushi in the hilarious 1978 film, Animal House. This whole premise is based off the very popular Saturday Night Live skit that Belushi and Aykroyd created. After Jake Blues (John Belushi) is released from prison, he and his brother Elwood (Dan Akyroyd) visit the orphanage where they grew up. They learn that the Archdiocese will stop raising money for the orphanage and they will auction the place off. This is when Jake receives a, \"mission from God.\" This mission has the brothers reuniting their old blues band to perform a big gig to raise the necessary 5000 dollars needed to save the place. As they set about their adventure, they seem to be making more 'friends' along the way.The impeccable charms of the cast is one of the great things about the movie. Belushi is a great actor and he shares great chemistry with Aykroyd. Just like in Animal House, you can't help rooting for the big man. That guy was absolutely funny here. In addition to wonderful leads, we have a whole slew of cameos to mention. My favorite one is Carrie Fisher's role as a mystery woman who suddenly appears out of nowhere with these giant rocket launchers just to kill Jake. I liked John Candy as the one of the hit men after Jake. Also, Henry Gibson deserves credit as the leader of the neo-Nazi gang. We also have a range of musicians in the move such as the likes of Aretha Franklin, James Brown, and Ray Charles. All of these people really added charm into the movie.If there would be anything to bring down the film, it would be how over-the-top the film is. I mostly enjoyed how crazy the film got at times, but I know people who had complaints. For example, the Joliet Brothers are chased in the end by what seems to be every police force, the entire U.S Army, and crazy Neo-Nazis\u0085.all at once. It may be much for someone to comprehend, but then again the movie works because it truly embraces how silly it can get. It uses its two comedic leads in Aykroyd and Candy as the force of the film and everything else is worked around these two men.Overall, this is a very fun film filled with an abundant amount of energy. It's funny, over-the-top, and musically-inclined. I see right away why this film is an instant classic and it goes down as one of my favorite movies.My Grade: A",

I'd seen bits and pieces on T.V. and knew what kind of movie it was -- also that I didn't like what I had seen and wasn't very excited about sitting down and watching the whole thing. My reservations were well founded.\"The Blues Brothers\" is a set of skits loosely strung together to resemble a plot. There are a lot of car chases and crashes, lots of things being destroyed, and lots of musical numbers. It could have been fun, but it's full of dead air and long stretches where nothing much of anything, not even something funny, is going on. You'd think if anyone could make a skit movie funny it would be two actors who cut their teeth on SNL, but that's not the case. No doubt its popularity relies heavily on its anti-authority theme, since that seems to be something people, or maybe it's just American viewers, seem to instinctively respond to. Cops are buffoons, petty criminals are cool. I don't have any objections to this if I think the actors playing the petty criminals are cool, but I personally don't much like either Aykroyd or Belushi.The highlights of the film are the cameos by famous singers like Ray Charles, James Brown and Aretha Franklin, though I've almost never seen anyone do a worse job of lip-synching (to her own song, no less!!) as Aretha Franklin.Grade: C",

I forgot how well shot and edited this film is, and could watch Dan Akroyd and John Belushi in these roles all day (Akroyd's high-stepping dance moves in particular always mesmerize me). Bless them for fighting for and crediting the artists they were covering, and for giving so many legends a chance to shine: Cab Calloway (at 73!), Ray Charles, Aretha Franklin, John Lee Hooker, and James Brown, as well as members of Booker T. & the MG's and Blood, Sweat, and Tears. I absolutely love the music in this film and the energy it generates, and for these characters to have been developed during the height of the disco era, highlighting soul and blues music was a fantastic throwback.The action sequences are over-the-top to say the least, including Carrie Fisher's vengeful character, and I wondered just how many cars were crashed (answer: 103!). It's excessive and probably goes on longer than it should have, but it's so stylish and humorous that I felt nothing but joy. It's offset a little by knowing how much drug use was going on behind the scenes, something that would kill Belushi within two years, but this film lives on as part of his enduring legacy. See this film for its infectious humor, and outstanding music.",

            "content": "Written by John Landis and Dan Aykroyd and starring a whopping cast of acting and musical stars, this 1980 film is musical, comedy, adventure, with a bit of fantasy thrown in too. The characters Jake and Elwood Blues were created by Belushi and Aykroyd as a sketch on \"Saturday Night Live\", with additional input from Howard Shore. Considering the way, the concept was birthed, this film became a success both commercially and as a cult film, pathing the way for the fictional brothers to be featured in other mediums too, including the music charts and video games - not to mention a sequel 1998 too.After serving 3 years in prison, Jake Blues is picked up by his brother Elwood, in the Bluesmobile - an old police car. They pay a visit to Sister Mary Stigmata that the Roman Catholic orphanage they grew up in will be closed unless $5,000 in property taxes is paid. Initially they are reluctant to help, but during a sermon by Reverend Cleophus James at the Triple Rock Baptist church Jake has an epiphany and decides to re-form the Blues Brothers band and help. The police are immediate on their tail as Elwood is driving with a suspended license and has over 100 unpaid parking tickets as well as over 50 moving violations. Not only are the police on their tale, but a mysterious woman seems intent on ending their lives with an arsenal of weapons. After escaping the police and near death, the Blues Brothers embark on a mission to pull the band back together. The band have all being doing other jobs while Jake was in prison, and some of them are harder to persuade than others. Once the band are back together, the next obstacle to overcome it getting gigs, but the Blues Brothers are crafty, and have some old friends they can try to persuade too. After putting on a big show at the Palace Hotel Ballroom, north of Chicago, they then have to race to the Chicago City Hall building to pay off the debt they have been on a mission on to clear. As well as the police and an angry woman, they also have trouble with other people they have upset along the way, including a country and western band, and a branch of the Illinois Nazis.Filmed all over Chicago and acting as an advertisement for the film industry to consider Chicago for future films, the spectacle that audiences eventually got, if you discount the different cut releases, was a fun and entertaining thrill ride which brought adventure and great music into people's lives. It also showcased the great American city, and it landscapes and features. I remember my parents bringing the VHS version of this home one day and watching in awe as cars did miraculous and ludicrous stunts. I was in awe of how to guys in black suits, hats, and sunglasses, raced across Chicago with so many pursuers and did not get stopped or killed. I fell in love with this film the very first time I watched it and have enjoyed every subsequent viewing of it since. I have a copy of the soundtrack that accompanied the film, I have other \"Blues Brothers\" records too, and I've been to see many a tribute act putting on their own \"Blues Brothers\" show. Having come from a sketch on \"Saturday Night Live\" this film has since transcended its humble beginning and because a cult film the likes of which have not been seen since. Sure, there is the sequel to this first film, but for me that does not come close this masterpiece. It is a musical tour-de-force that should not work but somehow does. It features some of the best car chases in history, foot-tapping and sing along musical numbers, raw and dark humour mixed with some fun visual slapstick, and lots and lots of entertainment. This film knows it is over the top, and revels in it - you just have to watch the Bluesmobile doing a twisting backflip as it reverses off a broken highway bridge to avoid the Illinois Nazis. Aykroyd and Belushi make a great double act bouncing off each other and leading this film, and with Landis telling a straightforward story that does not alienate audiences, with lots of pace and excitement, this is indeed a wonderful film.",

It is very much character driven, with Jake and Elwood, for me, being one of the most inspired and entertaining double acts to come out of Saturday Night Live. The concept of them being so openly criminal, yet doing it all for a wonderfully good cause makes them the very definition of lovable rogues.There are so many hilarious sight gags and moments of funny banter, it is hard to pick out favourites. I love the scene in Bob's Country Bunker, likewise the destruction of the shopping mall, the Palace Hotel Ballroom show, and the final big chase.There are a number of great support performances such as Carrie Fisher, John Candy, Charles Napier, and Henry Gibson. Plus musical legends James Brown, Aretha Franklin, Ray Charles, John Lee Hooker, Cab Calloway and Chaka Khan all perform.If you like the culture of soul revivalist music and the city of Chicago this is a fantastic tribute to it all.The cinematography set around various Chicago locations is excellent and works so well for the story, music and humour. The city is almost an extra character in the movie.Both Ackroyd and James Belushi are brilliant in most scenes. Belushi makes me laugh without even saying anything.I am probably rating it higher than it really deserves out of the bias associated with a long time admiration for the movie, stars, humour, and music, but I don't care. It recently held my 6 year old daughter's attention for the duration (I skipped past the f-bombs) which is another plus point in my book.",

            "content": "What do you get when you get two of the most famous alums from \"Saturday Night Live\", who concoct two blues musicians into their own musical act. Well, when we are talking about Dan Aykroyd and John Belushi, you get The Blues Brothers. Their pairing was one of the great highlights of SNL's first several years on NBC, leading to a hit album. And then it led into a wildly successful, but also arguably wildly overblown, 1980 smash hit film.Aykroyd and Belushi are, respectively, Ellwood and Jake Blues, a pair of Chicago-based blues musicians. Belushi is the one gets released from jail; and when the two of them get back together, they find out that the orphanage where they were raised is about to get shut down by the Windy City Archdiocese; and the only way they figure that the place can be preserved is to raise the $5,000 property tax owed by the Cook County assessor's office, and do it in an eleven-day span. They get a lot of help from some very famous people (Ray Charles, James Brown, Aretha Franklin, Cab Calloway, and dozens of others) in what Aykroyd always refers to as their \"mission from God\", but they also attract some exceptionally unwanted attention from a lot of crazy people, including a neo-Nazi nutcase (Henry Gibson), a deranged woman (Carrie Fisher), and what seems to be the whole Illinois law enforcement community. The result is a lot of fun in the various musical sequences, especially given the people involved.That said, however, in the final half hour, as Aykroyd and Belushi make their 106-mile run into Chicago (with, of course, a full tank of gas, half a pack of cigarettes, in the middle of the night, and with both of them wearing sunglasses), THE BLUES BROTHERS becomes a wild destruction derby, in which the Windy City is for all intents and purposes trashed to hell and back, that is as ear-splitting (if not more so) as it is funny. Even by 21st century standards, this mayhem, concocted by director John Landis under the rather skewed idea that bigger is always better, especially as he had a (then) extravagant $30 million budget to fool around with, and still decades away from the CGI of, say, AVENGERS: ENDGAME, is still as overcooked as hell. Pile-ups of cop cars (seemingly hundreds), combined with explosions, the over-the-top death of Gibson (his Nazi car falls off a bridge 1,400 feet downward, like Slim Pickens riding the Bomb in DOCTOR STRANGELOVE), and the destruction of a shopping mall are only funny up to a point before they just become excuses for equating destruction with laughs; and this is something that Landis frequently misses the boat on (as did Steven Spielberg in his wildly overblown 1979 WW II comedy \"1941\"). However, during the final sequence of mayhem, Landis does stage quite the masterful car chase underneath Chicago's elevated train tracks that would seem to pay homage to the similar one involving Gene Hackman in the 1971 classic THE FRENCH CONNECTION.Despite what may seem to be churlish criticisms on my part, I am not going to demote this film in any way. Clearly Aykroyd and Belushi (the latter on those days when he didn't have his face in the very white powder that would cut his life prematurely short) do a great job in their roles, in those moments where Landis' \"bigger is better\" directing style gets out of the way, along with Spielberg himself in the brief role of the Cook County assessor's office clerk at the end, and of course all the musical greats. Thus, despite Landis' penchant for overblown action and violent destruction, THE BLUES BROTHERS does remain one hugely entertaining musical comedy, both for its time and, arguably, for all time.",

It looks fabulous, (it's like a Frank Tashlin movie from the fifties on a much larger scale). What it is, really, is a series of sketches, some of them terrific, rather than a plot, interrupted by some great musical numbers. It may be a terrible film, (it's like a big screen version of \"Saturday Night Live\"), but it has two great iconic moments.Aretha Franklin plays a waitress and gets to strut her stuff and sing \"Think\" and it's a legendary moment, and Cab Callaway gets to do \"Minnie the Moocher\" in front of a large audience and he's magnificent. And any movie that has Ray Charles and James Brown in it is doing something right. The film quickly developed a cult following and has since spawned a stage show based on it's leading characters. It has become something of a classic. It's certainly a guilty pleasure. In Italy, Fellini might have made something like this on an off-day and if he was in a good mood. Unfortunately, the climatic chase, while spectacular, does drag on a bit (and what a waste of 1000 extras).",

At first it seems like raising the cash will be easy but the brothers soon have Nazies, cops, angry cowboys and others chasing them through Chicago. THE BLUES BROTHERS is one of the most entertaining bad movies I've ever seen. There's so many great things in this movie but at the same time there are so many things that bothered me and kept me from enjoying the picture even more. We'll start with the bad and I'd say it's obvious that there's no story here. Instead of an actual story we just get non-stop music scenes as well as car crashes, two things that actually work in the movie but the extended running time is just way too long and I was constantly looking at the watch to see how much longer there was. The lack of any real story and the extended running time are certainly the two things that keep this from being better because outside of this there's quite a bit to enjoy here. The best thing is the fact that Landis pretty much throws everything out the window and right at the viewer. This includes some of the craziest, most over-the-top chase/wreck scenes that you're ever going to witness. There are many throughout the picture but for me the highlight would have to be the one inside the mall where everything in sight gets destroyed at least twice. Another good thing the film has going for it are some of the musical performances especially the ones dealing with Ray Charles, Cab Calloway, Aretha Franklin and John Lee Hooker. Then, of course, you've got Belushi and Aykroyd turning in great performances as the Blue Brothers. You can't help but feel like you're watching real brothers doing real blues. THE BLUES BROTHERS is far from perfect but there's still enough here that makes it worth viewing.",

Can they get the money earnestly together with their blues band or do they have to take more extreme measures?The Blues Brothers defines the word \"cool\". Terrific music throughout, wildly chaotic car chases plus the right mix of highkey and lowkey comedy. But most of all it's the duo of Jake and Elwood which has given it the reputation it has. They are so levelheaded throughout that even when someone tries to outright blow them up, they carry on like nothing has happened. They don't let barriers push them down, they break through every barrier with a crash. Elwood is granted the more optimistic one of the two, but both of them work together very hard and find a solution to any problem no matter how hopeless it may seem. Their nice, brotherly friendship helps make this film as memorable as it is. Dan Aykroyd gives a great straightfaced performance and his deadpan delivery of the lines makes them all the funnier. I'd never seen anything with John Belushi before, but he makes a strong first impression on me. He's simply hysterical as Jake, and provides most of the comedy in the film with his character's crazy impulses such as singing passionately in an all-black church and his rendition of the Rawhide theme. I also love how convincingly he tricks his ex-wife (played by the equally brilliant Carrie Fisher) into sparing him and his brother by giving such a heartfelt speech I wondered if they suddenly were gonna patch things up, only for him to literally throw her in the mud instead.Of course though, what would a movie about blues be without the music? We have cameos from legends like Ray Charles, Cab Calloway, James Brown and Aretha Franklin, who all get a chance to shine musically as well as comedically. Franklin's musical number is both amusing and incredibly sung and Ray Charles is charming as the friendly, but slightly greedy instrument shop owner. Aykroyd and Belushi sing surprisingly well when they finally arrive at their own concert they are late to (you'll know why once you see it) with the song Everybody Needs Somebody To Love. Like every catchy tune, it got stuck in my head like a suction cup.Although it's not the funniest 80's comedy I've seen, it's one of the most entertaining ones to watch.",

Of course, their efforts to do so end up causing trouble with the law, as well as other people (such as a country and western-themed bar and the band that was supposed to play there).

With that being said i'm from Chicago and I adore the music in the movie so you would think I love this movie, you're wrong.There are only certain movies that can truly pull off this type of tone. Having ridiculous over-the-top action sequences is fine once in awhile, but when you have them in 50% of your movie and have the scenes go on for 10-15 minutes at a time, you have a problem. To me the film just got stupid after awhile. There wasn't a single laugh out loud moment, just a few chuckles. People have always told me that Aykroyd and Belushi were the greatest comedic duo ever on screen. While they had great chemistry, nothing they said together really made me laugh.I wanted to love this film. In fact it goes against my blood to dislike this film. I live in the Chicago suburbs and grew up listening to these songs play on the streets of Chicago so it pains me to say this film is ridiculously not funny. It was cool seeing celebrity cameos and hearing the songs being played but in all, it was a huge letdown.+Cameos +Music -I didn't really laugh -Unnecessarily long runtime-Over-the-top action sequences -Scenes would drag on for far too long5.0/10",

They're on a mission from God. They're Back. The Most Dangerous Combination Since Nitro and Glycerine. The show that really hits the road. A briefcase full of blues.One of the highest-grossing movies of all time in America and with big budget . A cataclylismic orgy of destruction , mayhem and noise .

They became like the adults Bud Abbott and Lou Costello of the Eighties .However , two years later Belushi was dead , from an accidental overdose of drugs . You could call it a bluesical, in fact with all the singers playing their own singing and dancing and a host of the blues legends performing through the film .

Followed by Blues Brothers 2000 (2008) in which John Belushi is replaced by John Goodman , along with Dan Aykroyd, Joe Morton , Nia Peeples , Kathleeen Freeman , B. B. King , Frank Oz .This nutty comedy was well directed by John Landis. This great filmmaker John Landis is a notorious writer/producer/director with a long career .

            "content": "If you asked me my favourite movie, this would probably be it. They could never make another film like this, it's too over the top and nutty. We see an amazing line-up of blues performers and music -- Aretha Franklin, James Brown, Ray Charles, Cab Calloway, Sam & Dave, Steve Winwood, and the Blues Brothers band members who are all superb. The most ambitious stunts ever seen. The best comic actors including John Belushi, Dan Ackroyd, John Candy, and Henry Gibson. Even the cameos are first class, such as Twiggy, Stephen Spielberg, Frank Oz and Carrie Fisher. Just about every scene is a classic. The Nazi rally that Jake and Elwood crash into, the redneck country bar where the band performs behind chicken wire because the drunks throw bottles at them, Elwood's apartment where the trains go by non stop, and Jake and Elwood acting like pigs in a posh French restaurant in a bid to blackmail the maitre d' into coming back into the band. Yes it's a series of sketches, but the film's plot, about brothers Jake and Elwood getting their band back together to raise money to save their old orphanage, propels the film beautifully. Even the fact the band members aren't all good actors is funny. They all have a ball while sending themselves up as hapless musos roped into the Blues Brothers' crazy antics. If I had to choose a favourite scene (so hard!) it would be Ray Charles' Shake Your Tail Feather, just for Charles's joyful yet defiant playing and singing, and the way a street full of people boogies along with all those wonderful dance steps. Then at the end, Ray agrees to give Jake and Elwood the keyboard, and Ray says, ''and as usual, I gotta take an IOU''. Which is a throwaway line, but I also took it to mean, we all owe a lot, culturally, to true blues musicians like Charles. We're indebted to them, as are the Blues Brothers.",

The BB band is composed of excellent musicians such as Lou Marini, Alan Rubin and Donald \"Duck\" Dunn among others. One interesting aspect of the movie I haven't read about in other reviews (so far) concerns spoofs of other movies and TV shows. For instance, when Jake gets out of prison he walks through a blinding white light and out the gate, reminiscent of the kidnapped earthlings disembarking from the giant UFO near the end of \"Close Encounters.\" The interview with the \"Penguin\" (walking up a long flight of stairs, and the Penguin floating back into the room) is a spoof on \"The Exorcist.\" Jake and Elwod's interview with the landlady is a spoof on the old TV show \"Dragnet.\" The car chase under the El spoofs \"The French Connection\" car chase and even uses several seconds of footage from the movie. The scene in which a police dispatcher authorizes \"the use of excessive force to apprehend the Blue Brothers\" spoofs the old TV show \"Highway Patrol\" and I believe the movie dispatcher was in the TV show as well. I'm not quite sure how the Nazis chasing our heroes is a spoof of \"Apocalypse Now\" but the music (Wagner's \"Flight of the Valkyries\") in this sequence was used in both films.

            "content": "Did \"The Blues Brothers\" introduce millions of white Americans to the African-American art form of the blues? Factually, that's maybe tough to argue with. Over forty years later, is it regrettable that a blues band fronted by two white guys had to serve as its catalyst for crossing over into the larger conversation?Hindsight is always 20/20, and 1980 was the proverbial different world back then, but with the possible exception of similarly stark-white blues champions The Rolling Stones, one could argue that no musical or cinematic vehicle has so successfully introduced the brilliance of an underrepresented art form to such a massive crossover audience. Granted, there's no question that bits of \"The Blues Brothers\" now feel like we're watching something being borrowed and worn from someone else's closet (see: the church and street market scenes). Then again, there's also little question that Dan Aykroyd and John Belushi are lovingly entrenched in these transformative tunes (they started the Blues Brothers band before the film took shape, and it was loaded with African-American blues legends). Nor is it in doubt that this music comedy almost singularly kicked in the door to allow an army of descendant films to pour in.Perhaps there's an argument that \"The Blues Brothers\" has become even more engrossing today because of these nuanced dynamics.

But to be honest I vaguely remember hating this movie the first time I saw it many years ago and watched it again last night to see if it was as bad as I remembered Jake is released from prison and his brother Elwood comes to pick him up in a second hand police car and the opening sequences seem to drag on . Considering THE BLUES BROTHERS is supposed to be a musical comedy there`s a complete absence of either music or comedy . Later on we do get musical numbers and there is some uplifting moments especially with the Ray Charles number . However with most musicals the segments featuring singing and dancing are set pieces that don`t fit into the narrative easily . There`s also a wider problem with the movie and that is it has no real narrative shape . All through the movie characters and incidents happen as if it seemed like a good idea at the time so by the end we have a chaotic embarrasing mess as troops , fire engines , policemen and SWAT teams chase after Jake and Elwood . In many ways THE BLUES BROTHERS is very similar to the Bond spoof CASINO ROYALE with sometimes memorable musical interludes amidst self indulgent and oh so painfully self indulgent comedy set pieces",

We've got a full tank of gas, half a pack of cigarettes, it's dark, and we're wearing sunglasses.\" - Elwood. \"Hit it.\" - Jake.Director John Landis can make a great movie out of the most simplistic premises. After working with the late John Belushi on National Lampoon's Animal House in 1978, he returns to give us the funny, satirical, wickedly hilarious Blues Brothers. At first glance, the blend of music and comedy may throw many off, but if you're willing to go back to a time when movies were movies, The Blues Brothers is quite a throwback.The film's greatest accomplishment stems from its unlimited energy and desire to have fun. Jake and Elwood (played by Dan Akroyd and John Belushi) are one of the most enigmatic duos who ever made it on the big screen, and provide inseparable chemistry especially when at the mic. Even when they aren't at the mic, they are either doing some of the funniest fight sequences or claiming to yet another strange they're on a mission from God.A formal storyline is almost nonexistent. It's best to just go along for the ride. After getting out of the big house for an armed robbery, \"Joliet\" Jake is forced by his brother Elwood to go see a nun at their old home. They both learn that the orphanage will be closed if they do not pay their dues; $5,000 in property taxes. Ultimately, Jake gets the genius idea to reform their old rhythm and blues band. From there on out spawns a sea of insanity and a never-ending line of one liners.The Blues Brothers is lengthy and about twenty minutes could've been set on the scrap floor. But the execution is near perfect. There are two car chases that could very well rank in some of the best ever executed in film. Police cars topple each other, one after another, and the film knows when to start and when to end them.Fun not only stems from the enigmatic protagonists, but the extremely well acted music numbers. The theme from Rawhide, the classic ladies-hit \"Think,\" and even that hometown classic of \"Sweet Home Chicago\" are all played ecstatically throughout the film. They surely won't get out of your head anytime soon after hearing them.The Blues Brothers is a fun, energized comedy that starts fast and rarely lets up in terms of comedy and music. It's a Chicago classic and one of the funniest and smartest musical comedies I have yet to see.By the way, how do you knock a film that has two lead characters on a mission from God?

Men aren't supposed to like musicals, yet here is one that any man, and women, especially those who have any positive feel for rhythm and blues music, will enjoy this film. It's funny, involves things blowing up, men in tacky Western outfits, and features many outstanding performances by great R&B singers. Ray Charles, Aretha Franklin, James Brown, and Cab Calloway all lend their great musical talents to this otherwise fun movie about two guys who dress alike who want to raise money for their former orphanage. To do so, they reunite with their former blues band, one they left to serve time in jail. After a rocky first outing at a country bar, one with chicken wire to protect the band, they are able to get one more gig at a hotel outside of Chicago. Everything is all set, that is except their car runs out of gas. It's little moments like that where the movie succeeds, where it is funniest, and where the considerable talents of Belushi and Aykroyd come through and shine. Carrie Fischer plays a crazed ex-wife of one of the Blues Brothers, i suppose in a break from her Princess Leia past, and look for Frank Oz and Steven Spielberg in small, yet noticeable roles.

Unfortunately this band gets into trouble with the law and what follows is without a doubt the most outrageous police chase. Even if you cant enjoy the very beginning of the movie please do give the last half an hour a try, because it is truly hilarious with the most bizarre and hilarious car chase in the history of american cinema. Filmed back in the days when there were no cgi or computer effects, so all the cars that crash are REAL crashes. I assure you, that truly enhances the fun A LOT!Besides this legendary car chase the music alone makes this movie worth watching: music performances and acting by Ray Charles, John Lee Hooker, James Brown, Arehta Franklin. These are all music legends. Amazing that director John Landis pulled it off to get all those stars into 1 flick like this.There is also a funny appearance at the very end by none other than Steven Spielberg, who never acts in any picture, but did so this time around.\"The Blues Brothers\" gained a cult status decades ago. A cult status doesnt necessarily mean it is a masterpiece, it isnt, but the movie just struck a chord for many weirdos back in the eighties. Music bands have been formed which were inspired by this movie. Special Blues Brothers movie screenings are still regularly being held worldwide, to honor this absurd yet classic music road movie. At those festive blues brothers nights everybody goes wild with booze and drugs. Books have been written about John Landis' cult film. Documentaries have been made to analyse it. It has become bigger than anyone could have imagined back then...But please dont use common sense while watching this absurd music comedy. It does help if you are drunk (or stoned or both), when watching this movie, because it is DELIBERATELY simplistic and silly. Very enjoyable and hilarious nonetheless...",

            "content": "I must say straight up that this musical 'comedy' just ain't my scene. Jake and Elwood Blues are on a mission from God - which finds them on the run from the law, neo-Nazis, redneck country bands and aggrieved ex-fianc\u00e9es. In order to save their Catholic boys home from closure, the guys decide to put 'the band' back together after 'seeing the light'. What follows is a state wide scramble as the guys gather the old crew together while always narrowly avoiding capture.Writers Dan Aykroyd and John Landis' offbeat script, which is part time slapstick and part time satire, really fails for me as a comedy. Their dialogue is incredibly dry and sardonic, but so much so it's parched. The best laugh on offer is probably the mall scene in which Jake and Elwood drive around the local shopping centre doing a spot of casual window shopping, while the police are in hot pursuit.The catchy musical numbers are what saves the film, with some rhythm and blues being matched with some smart, wacky choreography. Contributing to this soul-fest are some of the all time greats including Cab Calloway, Aretha Franklin, James Brown, Ray Charles, John Lee Hooker and the Blues Brothers band. The cast of actors do a reasonable job, with Aykroyd and John Belushi (obviously enjoying themselves) being backed up by Carrie Fisher, John Candy, Henry Gibson, Frank Oz, Charles Napier, Jeff Morris, Kathleen Freeman and Twiggy.Stephen M. Katz captures the action with skill and Ira Newborn supplies the incidental music.Saturday, September 14, 1996 - Video",

The goofball stuff actually boosts the movie in my opinion. And lest I forget to mention the music is timeless and fantastic, as are the stars and guest stars who bring it to us. A who's who of soul and the original R&B, with \"a sound powerful enough to turn goat piss into gasoline!\"",

They deliver top notch performances as these characters that think their a lot more threatening and suspicious than they actually are.The only thing that disappointed me was how little we learn about either Jake or Elwood throughout the film, I understand that they wanted to leave a bit of mystery to them, but I felt the story would have been far more engaging had we known more about the brothers as people prior to heading on this journey. The music in this film is also great, there is not a single song I did not enjoy. They are all very catchy and the amazing musicians they got in this movie to play some of the songs, as well as Aykroyd and Belushi themselves. are outstanding.It is a simple, straight forward and fun film that you can switch your brain off whilst viewing and simply have a good time. The Blues Brothers is a great movie that I would recommend to anyone looking for a great comedy or musical.Two brothers, Jake and Elwood Blues, must bring their old band back together in order to save the orphanage they grew up in from shutting down.Best Performance: John Belushi",

And car chase scenes that would make Minis salivate, and an array of side plots that work so seamlessly with the \"Mision from God\".The on-screen chemistry between the band is frictionated and therefore completely accurate for anyone who has been in a group, but when the music starts, always a guaranteed classic throughout the film, then the magic of the film really happens.A film that borders genius and then creates a whole new country, and one that may be re-attempted, but never rivalled.",

I'm more of a sarcasm and black comedy kind of guy so I rarely encounter a comedy that I really like.That being said, this is a neat little film. Built around the personalities of John Belushi and Dan Aykroyd and their sketch characters Jake and Elwood, it's a twisting and turning journey to save an orphanage that they both grew up in. On their trip they gather allies, make enemies, play some gorgeous music and generally get into trouble.So what works? Well, the music for one. Most of the musicians playing in Jake and Elwood's band are actual, real life jazz and blues musicians and you can believe that they can actually play. Heck, even Belushi and Aykroyd are actual musicians, so whenever a musical number starts, the movie instantly picks up in quality. Furthermore, the film has some good appreciation for physical humour, long and imaginative chase scenes and the rough Chicago style world of blues looks kind of fetching.Unfortunately it's meant to be a comedy and I never really found it all that funny. The main joke is supposed to be that Jake and Elwood are never really bothered by anything, and it... kind of works? If straight man humour is your thing, I'm sure you'll be laughing your ass off. If it's not, the movie falls flat pretty quickly. There's some enjoyment to be found in the action-oriented jokes and in the general blight of these two bums, but you have to find Jake and Elwood funny for you to enjoy this film.Still, it's a fine movie. The music is great, the general story is not bad, it's well acted and it looks good. Give it a chance and I'm sure you'll find something in it to enjoy.",

One thing that shocked me was: how much faith they had in a five-(or less)-minute sketch on SNL. They must've had this huge budget \u2013 blowing up buildings, destroying malls \u2013 and the length was far too long. But\u0085at the same time, that was the biggest problem: it was far too long and it took far too long to get going. That said, it was thoroughly worth the journey of the men in black once it did build steam \u2013 especially from the comic genius John Belushi (check out the fantastic nonchalantly they handle the out-of-left-field situations they find themselves in) and the \"guest appearances,\" my favorite of which was, believe it, Carrie Fisher.

By the time you get to the end of the movie, you get the feeling that John Landis knew the movie wasn't really working - so he decided to just make the scale of the chase scene completely ridiculous in order to try and make someone laugh at something.The music numbers are what saves the movie from being a complete failure. They're so good that they will make you forget about just how stupid the rest of the movie actually is. Side note : I think it's worth noting that John Landis is completely overrated in himself. Sure, he directed \"Animal House\", and \"American Werewolf In London\". But, his failures FAR outweigh his successes. Just to name some of his other flops : \"Spies Like Us\", \"Three Amigos\", \"Oscar\", \"Beverly Hills Cop 3\", and of course \"Blues Brothers 2000\".

'Would you like to come out for like, er, a date'; 'I hate Illinois Nazis'; '..get a new cigarette lighter'.In isolation these quotes don't make any sense, but in situ they are classic lines by the masters that are Belushi and Ackroyd.  This is a film paying homage to some of the best music ever made, that steals classic comic performances from Aretha Franklin and Ray Charles and if I am not mistaken beats Michael Jackson to the punch by a mile with a massive group dance using the 'chicken' (the zombie dance in the Thriller video is a direct copy of the dance routine in the street while BB King is performing on the sidewalk, wearing incredible shoes).This is a film that every house should own.  Not only is it extremely funny due to script, timing from the Bro's and quite frankly the total sex that is John Belushi, it is also heaving with classic tunes.  I have often had/been to parties where it is played in the background rather than putting the record/tape/CD player on (parties through the ages).As an education in how to put music and comic genius together to make a film that is timeless this is it.Let me give you an example.  I spent three years in South Africa as an expat from 1993 - 1996 and, of course, had this film on video (age again) as part of my collection.SA is a sociable place and often new found friends from office, pub etc. would collect at my house for a meal (almost always a Braai).  \"What's this?\" one such person says one evening as I am tossing food on the barbecue, \"I've never heard of the Blues Brothers\".  \"Put it on\" I say, with quizzical looks from other guests that the TV should be switched on while we are out in the garden.  \"and turn the volume up\".Rest history.  20 Captownians turned on to music they were never allowed to hear, gravitating indoors to see where it is coming from and then screaming with laughter while they danced in front of the TV.This film, in my experience has changed lives.Buy it, watch it, tell your children.",

Oftentimes, even if I don't see the draw to one of these must-see films after I see it, I will at least understand the hype; I do not see the hype with The Blues Brothers. The 1980 film directed by John Landis starring Dan Aykroyd and John Belushi tells the tale of a set of brothers on a mission from God to raise money for and save the Catholic home in which they were raised. The best way they can think of to accomplish this goal is to get back together the band they used to play in and donate the money to the home. Aided by a myriad of musical stars throughout the film, The Blues Brothers turns out to be an extended music video sequence rather than a cohesive film.Jake 'Joliet' Blues (John Belushi) has just been released from prison to the care of his brother Elwood Blues (Dan Aykroyd). Jake promised to visit \"The Penguin\" (Kathleen Freeman) on the first day of his release. \"The Penguin\" was one of the nuns who raised them through childhood in the Catholic boarding school in which they lived. During their visit, they are told that the boarding school's funding has been cut and will no longer be able to sustain itself unless they are able to secure $5000.00 in 11 days. Feeling compelled, The Blues Brothers decide to help, but given their collective aversion to law abiding, obtaining the money honestly will prove to be the biggest problem. Finally, divine intervention hits and the two decide to reform the band they used to play in, host a couple concerts, and donate the money to the boarding school. Elwood, however, has not held up his part of the bargain of maintaining contact with the rest of the band members while Jake was in prison. The two must now go on an adventure to find the band members, who have since all taken straight jobs, in order to be able to play the concerts. Their adventure ruffles a few feathers along the way and it becomes much more of a race against time to achieve their mission from God than the two thought it would be.I had always disregarded this film as a frivolous film based on a popular Saturday Night Live skit, thinking that there can't be much more to it than that, after seeing it, I found out I was mostly right. I'm not a fan of SNL, so perhaps I would have gained more out of the film if I was familiar and enjoyed the skit it was based on. There was just so much more bad than good in this film. The pacing was unbelievably slow. A solid 45-minutes of this film could have been cut at a favorable service to the audience. The amazing thing is that throughout the slow, tedious pacing of the film, the character development was incredibly deficient. I never learned enough to care about either of the brothers or their \"mission from God\". The chemistry between Aykroyd and Belushi was fantastic, one can tell that the two were truly great friends. Good chemistry does not good acting make, however. I struggle to even call what the two did acting as they were more focused on appearing \"cool\" than portraying anything. There were some redeeming qualities to the film. I was ignorant to the fact that John Landis directed the film until his credit rolled up at the beginning of the movie. I quite like some of his work and the incredible shots that I loved in his American Werewolf in London, were also present in The Blues Brothers. I couldn't believe how gorgeous this film looked, from the long shot up the stairs when the brothers visit \"The Penguin\" to the opening sequence of Jake being released from prison, the film is stuffed to the brim with amazing shots. The car chases, as ridiculous as they were, gave some enjoyment to an otherwise lackluster film. One can't adequately rate The Blues Brothers without mentioning the amazing musicians that took part in the project. Some notable names who lent their voices to this film include Ray Charles, Aretha Franklin, James Brown, and Cab Calloway. Clearly, musical talent was in no short supply for The Blues Brothers, and it is the music, in fact, that saves the film. Other than great music and wonderful shots, however, The Blues Brothers remains a gimmicky film (glasses through the entire film, really?) that I cannot, for the life of me, understand why it enjoys the status that it does.",

(If you look closely, you can see a sign for Esquire J-Town Clothing for Men and Boys...\"J-Town\" being a slightly more politically correct way of saying \"Jew Town\", a nickname for Maxwell street from way back). Anyway, John Lee is doing his thing accompanied by several members of Muddy Waters' blues band, plus the very colorful Big Walter Horton on harp. Before entering Aretha Franklin's diner, Jake and Elwood are just taking in the scene, and I gotta believe that John and Dan (the alter egos) were really enjoying themselves at that moment.As a musical comedy, I don't think anything came close during that time. While some critics were not happy with what they considered gratuitous exploitation of R&B giants like James Brown and Ray Charles, I for one am happy that someone like John Landis captured something as \"cool\" as Cab Calloway performing \"Minnie the Moocher\" with the very accomplished Blues Brothers band.If you can't have fun with this movie, you just ain't much fun.",

It is going out of business, and so the two go on a quest to raise the money to save the place. First they have to reform their old band, and then find a gig, a very big gig.In addition to featuring some of the funniest people of the decade, We also have Aretha Franklin, James Brown, and Ray Charles. We have lots of bottles getting thrown around, lots of glass getting smashed, rockets being launched, cars getting wrecked, and next thing you know half the US military is being sent out to take down a mere two nitwits, who are simply on a mission to do a good dead. This is an utterly goofy, and pretty darn lovable movie. Evern the music numbers are not too bad.The whole formula feels like Mel Brooks meets SNL, meets the soul/blues station. It's a little too mature to be a family comedy, (unless your youngest is over twelve). But it is a really fun film to watch, and has something to offer for (almost) everyone.",

I can't wait for next month's entry.\u00a0 In the meantime, check out THE BLUES BROTHERS on line (or watch for it to show up on cable - it is there often).Letter Grade:\u00a0 right on the border between A-/B+8 (out of 10) stars and you can take that to the Bank (OfMarquis)",

In 1980 legendary director John Landis gave the characters their own feature length film. The Blues Brothers stars Belushi and Akroyd as Jake and Elwood, respectively, and it follows them as they attempt to put their old band back together in order to raise money to save the Catholic orphanage home where they were raised. Dubbing this quest a mission from God the two set out on a wacky and action packed adventure full of screwball situations and nut job characters. What ensues is a lot of fun.The Blues Brothers is one of those essential 80's comedies. It's worked its way to earning the status of a classic and so these days, no matter how you feel about comedies, it's just one of those that you have to see. It's also one of the very few successful films to be made out of SNL characters, and that's always a treat to watch, especially if you know the characters from the TV show. Seeing them come to life in a whole new way through the big screen is something really exciting to witness. And with characters as classic as Jake and Elwood Blues, played by their original actors, the ingenious Dan Akroyd and John Belushi, it had to have been a nostalgic experience for 1980 audiences.I didn't get as much of this, however. I know the characters for how iconic they are today and I've seen some of the Blues Brothers SNL skits, but I can't say this movie had the same effect for me as it would have had for audiences back in the day excited to see their favorite SNL characters put on the big screen.As far as this just being a good movie, it's funny and that's about it. I definitely enjoyed watching this flick, but it's not much more than just a silly over-the-top comedy. The only thing that makes it better than a lot of the other screwball comedies like it would be it's great actors and the legendary status behind the characters. All in all, The Blues Brothers is just a lot of hilarious wackiness with some crazy song and dance numbers thrown in throughout. It's a lot of fun in a weird, explosive, irreverent way.",

Let out three years early for good behavior, Jake is horrified to discover that Elwood lied to him about the band going their own ways and both are unhappy to hear that the orphanage where they grew up is going to be bought out and torn down, even if the nun or \"penguin\" running the place used to smack them with rulers. Encouraged by their surrogate father Curtis (the late Cab Calloway) to get the money needed by the orphanage to keep it aloft, they go to church and Jake sees the light: \"The band!\"\nIn other words, they must reunite their band, play a few quick gigs and make a lot of money fast. Unfortunately, Elwood angers the Chicago police when they pull him over for allegedly running a red light (even though it was clearly yellow) and later they anger the Illinois Nazis by running them off a bridge during their demonstration, and even later they anger a country band by stealing their gig at Bob's Country Bunker and anger Bob too by refusing to pay him for the obscene amount of beer they drank. And to top it all off, Jake is being pursued by his jilted fiance, Carrie Fisher (her character is billed as \"Mystery Woman\" in the film, but according to one source her name was supposed to be Camille). Chaos and mayhem ensue along with some very good music that includes \"Everybody Needs Somebody To Love\", \"Jailhouse Rock\", \"Think\" (Aretha Franklin as the cafe owner and wife of Matt \"Guitar\" Murphy), \"Minnie The Moocher\", whatever those songs are that are sung by Ray Charles and James Brown, and the theme to TV's \"Rawhide\". The late John Candy plays one of the cops chasing Jake & Elwood, and Twiggy appears as a customer at a gas station that Elwood hits on.Memorable moments include Jake and Elwood being attacked by the nun, Jake seeing \"the light\", the car chase in the mall and the Nazi car chase among the other various car chases, Carrie Fisher's various attempts to kill Jake & Elwood, the Jailhouse rock ending, the restaruant scene, and the \"Everybody Needs Somebody To Love\" number.Did I mention that buddies John and Dan are hilarious as the deadpan brothers? Shame that John died so young, and a shame that they got Dan Aykroyd to write \"Blues Brothers 2000\". The special edition DVD includes lost footage like Elwood quitting his job at the glue factory, Elwood's secret garage for hiding the \"Blues-Mobile\", the cigarette packet that Elwood had jotted down the various names and addresses of the band, more dialogue between Elwood & Jake in general, and - GASP - the destruction of the gas station!

            "content": "Ever since its initial broadcast, comedy show \"Saturday Night Live\" has been the launching place for many comedians who use the chance of being in the show as a way to develop their talents and aim for a career on film. As members of the first generation of the show, Dan Aykroyd and John Belushi were among the first to make the jump from the show to the film industry. Although the pair had moderate success at first, Belushi became a modern icon of American comedy in 1978 with \"Animal House\". It was after that success when the two friends decided to make a movie about one of the most successful \"Saturday Night Live\" characters, the pair of R&B singers: \"The Blues Brothers\". Being his most beloved creation, Aykroyd began to write the full story of the characters, but ended up with over 300 pages of script. It was director John Landis' task to transform Aykroyd's script into a realizable movie.The movie begins with the release from prison of Jake Blues (John Belushi), co-founder and singer of the Blues Brothers band. After being picked up by his brother Elwood (Dan Aykroyd), he is informed that the band broke up after his incarceration and that the Blues Brothers are apparently over. However, after discovering that the old Catholic home where they were raised as kids is going to be sold because of its debts, the brothers decide that its their mission, a mission from God, to get the money to save the house, and the only way to achieve that goal will be to reform the legendary Blues Brothers band. With this idea the brothers set to find the band's former members, but in their way they'll find new enemies in the form of a Neo-Nazi group, a country band, and a mysterious woman who just wants the brothers dead.Written by Aykroyd and Landis, the script is essentially a musical tale that cleverly mixes action and comedy while paying homage to that good old rhythm and blues music that both were so fond of. While Aykroyd's extensive and detailed account of the characters' history has been transformed into a simpler, straight forward plot by Landis, the change is very effective as this way to unfold the story is more in tone with the frank and raw attitude of the brothers. The story is fast paced, as the brothers' tale of redemption is one of high octane energy with powerful musical performances and insane car chases that never make the story boring or tiresome. Making up for the simple plot are the very likable personalities of the two main characters, who carry the movie with their charm and a presence that proves that a memorable character is more than a collection of one liners.In this his fourth movie as a director, John Landis once again demonstrated why he was one of the most promising directors of the early 80s, showing a significant growth in his style of directing comedy that clearly set the basis for his 1981 masterpiece, \"An American Werewolf in London\". Already a master of the direction of big and complex set pieces, Landis takes this to a new level with the amazing car chases conceived for the film. With a bigger budget than in his three previous efforts, Landis creates an explosive musical that perfectly represents everything that Aykroyd and Belushi conceived as \"The Blues Brothers\". The duo's main trait is the music, and Landis knew this well, so the film is filled not only with the brothers' interpretations of R&B classics, but also the ones by real R&B legends such as Ray Charles, Aretha Franklin and Cab Calloway among others.As expected, the performances by John Belushi and Dan Aykroyd are of an excellent quality. While less over the top than in \"Animal House\", Belushi's genius for comedy shines through the film in his energetic role of Jake Blues, who is the one who receives the \"mission from God\". As the laconic Elwood, Dan Aykroyd delivers the subtler comedy in the movie, and shows a complete domain of his character. Together the pair make an excellent team that not only deliver fun comedy but also make an outstanding musical duo. While the Blues brothers are certainly the focus of the story, the vast array of guest stars that appear through the film deliver terrific performances when singing (Ray Charles, James Brown), acting (John Candy, Carrie Fisher) or both (Cab Calloway). The musical performances are simply top notch and make the film really special.As written above, the movie is first and foremost a musical homage to Chicago, so those expecting a laugh riot comedy will definitely find a different kind of beast. This is not to say that there is no comedy, on the contrary, the movie is filled with a good amount of laughs, but the focus of the film remains on the music. Still, \"The Blues Brothers\" is not your typical musical, as its fast pace makes it a thrilling ride like no other movie, and probably the features that most perfectly represents this are the amazing car chases that the stunt team developed for the movie. As in a rocking dance of destruction, the cars crash and smash across the streets of Chicago in some of the most incredible stunts on film. Some have criticized the emphasis put on this scenes, but I think that they fit perfectly in the mood and tone of the brothers themselves.Without a doubt the Blues brothers are two of the best and most famous characters created by Belushi and Aykroyd, and this movie truly makes them justice. While not the deepest or most insightful movie ever, \"The Blues Brothers\" is definitely one of the most entertaining ones, and its magic lays in that frank simplicity that surrounds the movie's story. Raw and direct, \"The Blues Brothers\" is a movie that truly makes Chicago feel like home, sweet home. 8/10",

As they struggle to gather their band together after a long hiatus, their rash and insensitive attitude causes the brothers a great deal of trouble, but just as often it gets them out of it.

This feel-good, hilarious and harmonious American classic is a tribute to Chicago and Blues music. Star actors John Belushi, Dan Aykroyd, Carrie Fisher and John Candy share the screen with talented musicians Aretha Franklin, James Brown, John Lee Hooker and Ray Charles. Aykroyd and Belushi work so well together that they seem like real-life brothers.",

This film takes away the seriousness and allows some escapism from everyday life. The scale of some of the over-the-top practical stunts and amazing musical talent makes this movie nothing short of a masterpiece.The plot is a real simple one. The Blues Brothers must raise $5,000 to save their childhood orphanage from being taken by the state. Along the way, the brothers get chased by cops, Nazis, and a crazy ex-girlfriend. Even with the world against them, the brothers cannot fail because they know that they're \"on a mission from God.\" Lots of real chemistry and subplots between each character in the movie add to the fun.All the cameos and star-spotting is extra fun. See some beautiful musical talent perform in their prime.Lots of inside jokes that come after multiple viewings add to the rewatchability.5/5. One of the most memorable comedy films I have ever watched. Instant classic for sure!",

The actors are the characters (The Blues Brother Band) and the characters (Jake and Elwood Blues) are the actors (John Belushi and Dan Akyrod).The jokes are still funny, and Belushi shines in this story. The Blues Brothers were created as a SNL skit, and then developed into this movie. I am guessing that if it wasn't for the untimely death of John Belushi (1982), this would have rocketed his career into super-stardom.The singing is Belushi's and Aykroyd's. On their hit album Belushi suggested that you go out and buy every blues record you hear. That's kind of impossible - but maybe it tells us something of Belushi, his love of the blues, and perhaps ... his heart. It's funny how you never get over missing someone - even a distant star like Belushi (and Radner) ... b/c their star keeps on shining.-LD_____________________________________________my faith: http://www.angelfire.com/ny5/jbc33/",

Barely able to figure if they can adjust life on the outside,they become informed that their old CAtholic orphanage is about to be foreclosed. Around this point in time,God gives them their mission:get the Blues Band back together and tour,raising money to stave off the impending shut-down of their childhood home. The ensuing odyssey has the boys traveling about Illinois and the region,seeking out old band-mates,foiling Illinois Nazis,duping a redneck bar and its patrons and avoiding a homicidal woman(Carrie Fisher),and that's all WHILE they're finding ways to run afoul of the law. Again. There's no simple way to describe just why this show is so special. I mean is it the music,featuring performances(acting as well as music)such luminaries as JAmes Brown,Aretha Franklin,Cab Calloway and Ray Charles? Or is it the action,with no fewer than two car chase scenes for good measure? How about the dry,button-down chemistry of Belushi and Aykroyd(in full \"Shee-KAH-go\" accents,no less!)adding weight to the spare,well-chosen screenplay? Is it the ace Blues Band,themselves no slouches at music? Or is it a combination of any to those? Maybe everything? There are no wrong answers here,though my choice would be all of the above,since the fusion of about two or three different movies in one. Director and co-writer(with Aykroyd)John Landis has a great eye for broad comedy born out of ordinary,even boring,slow-paced situations.It seems like its somewhat of a chore of finding this on DVD(or even on tape),which is a shame. I mention how films are keepers;this one is the definitive of the term! In the meantime,I(and anyone else who enjoyed this show) guess I'll just have to content myself with seeing this in reruns on various fine cable networks.",

Along the way, the group has a series of adventures.The Blues Brothers is a fun and cool adventure. The movie has two great leads that propel the movie, Dan Akyroid and John Belushi. These leads are incredibly charismatic in their roles. The movie uses this to its advantage well by having these two characters have great dialogue. I was constantly entertained by listening to the comedy and watching the great sketches unfold on the screen. The movie has ridiculous and impossible scenes that become hilarious to watch. As the characters said, they are on a mission from God that seemingly grants them a pass from progressively ridiculous events. The movie is written to take the ridiculous approach to comedy and it works in this movie's favor.I was able to enjoy The Blues Brothers without watching any of the previous Saturday Night Live sketches.

The plot was great, the setup was great, the acting was great, and the music - omg, brought the house down.I was extremely lucky to see this film while it was still showing it's first run at Mann's Chinese Theatre in LA. I still cannot find any version of this that has the amount of costumes and length of the song \"Minnie the Moocher\" that I saw in that theatre that day. I was told by those knowledgeable that they often got special versions no one else got - and I believe it - and it was more than worth it.RIP to my girlfriend at the time who took me there to see this film, she passed away in 1991 at the age of 29 - way too soon.I'm hoping that the 40 year anniversary edition coming out this year has the complete version of the song including all the costume changes (black/white/red/yellow/back to black). I'm sure about black and white and red, not so sure about the yellow but that song seemed to go on forever in the version I saw.I fell in love with the blues that day and I've always loved it since and will to my dying day.",

I couldn't stop giggling.However there were parts in the movie where i tended to lose focus, where it seemed to get a bit over the top - like when ray Charles is playing piano in the music store and 50 people start synchronized dancing outside the store. or the too long car chase in the mall, don't get me wrong, i love me a good mall car chase - just not one that seems to last 25 minutes. and i wasn't a big fan of the Aretha Franklin music number in the diner - at the time of watching i had no idea what Aretha looked like and as i was watching i couldn't help but note that the women singing was doing a bad lip syncing impersonation of Aretha - only to find out - it was Aretha franklin.but for those small pitfalls - the acting and gags couldn't be better - i couldn't imaging anyone else as Jake or Elwood and there are too many good scenes to name but here are a few, in the restaurant scene (one of my favorites where Jake offers to buy the little girl ' how much for the little girl, i want to buy the little girl' classic), when the blues brothers are singing rawhide, the Nazis in the car ' I've always loved you', the end scenes where it seems all of Chicago are after Jake and Elwood and they just stand in the elevator calm as you please.All in all you know its a good movie when you continually remember little bits here and there and they make you laugh - which this movie does. i know that from now on all costume parties i attend will be as one of the blues brothers.Its also a movie that will make you wonder, i know it made me wonder...

            "content": "This famous of all Chicago-related movies was better than \"Code of Silence\" and even better than the recent \"The Lake House\".The movie seems to be in two big parts. There is the famous duo, John Belushi and of course Dan Aykroyd, who play Joliet Jake Blues and Elwood Blues. Of course, the scene starts at the infamous Joliet Correctional Center where Jake is going to be out on parole for an armed robbery conviction, with Elwood in an old police car to pick him up from prison walls.Their mission (where the famous \"Mission from God\" phrase occurs over 5 times in the flick)---to get the Penguin (which is actually Katherine Freeman, who owned the St. Helen of the Blessed Shroud Orphanage in Calumet City, Illinois), called that because she was dressed in white and black like a penguin (she is actually a nun) to pay a property tax bill of $5000. When the Penguin refuses to pay that money (because she considered the brothers as sinners who were not able to repent) and kicks both of them out of her room and out of\nthe building, the only way they can accomplish the mission of raising funds for paying the tax bill is \"to put the band back together\"---The Blues Brothers Band, of course.But I also saw that another character, Carrie Fisher, who plays the \"Mystery Lady\" or \"Mystery Assassin\" (the latter is better), had other plans. She had a death wish on the famous two-man duo.She had a variety of weapons for the assassination of the Blues Brothers, which the two men dodge bullets, explosions, and fire by this hard-headed lady. The first assassination attempt used a rocket launcher at the transient hotel's entrance where the two men were; the next was detonation by dynamite of a transient hotel, thwarting even the police dynamic entry to the room where the two singing men slept. The next attempt was using a\nflame thrower at a propane tank near the telephone booth where the two man were talking in. The tank blows, causing the booth to go up and then tumble down, but the two men survive all that. Then, getting out of the Palace Hotel Ballroom in a water logged tunnel, the lady uses a semi-automatic weapon but the two men's verbal pleadings saved them from murder.But it was not just John Belushi, Dan Aykroyd, and Carrie Fisher that were important to me in that rhythm-and-blues movie that made Chicago rock. There were other characters that would eventually make up the backup band for the Blues Brothers-Steve \"The Colonel\" Cropper, Donald \"Duck\" Dunn, Willie \"Too Big\" Hall, and Don \"Bones\" Malone, with a keyboardist-singer leading them-a character named Murph (played by Murphy Dunne).They sound like famous boxing stars, but I realized all that in the Ramada Inn scene that these aforementioned characters played for a band called Murph and the Magitones, a fictional name for a gigging band that usually plays for parties. Then Dan (who played \"Elwood Blues\") and John (who played \"Joilet Jake Blues\") meet up with them and then this was probably the turning point, with Jake bringing out one of the important lines in the movie, \"We're puttin' the band back together.\"But besides the plot I like, I adored most of the music of the soundtrack that featured some of music's greatest superstars. I especially liked the dance scene where Ray Charles sang the R and B number, \"Twistin'\" and introduced the whole movie audience to some of the rock-and-roll and bop dances that we grew up with, especially in the heyday of the James Brown era. (Ray Charles played the character of the store owner of Ray's Music Exchange, and even while being visually-impaired, I perceived him as a second \"Stevie Wonder\" of some sort.) The shot for this Ray's Music Exchange scene most likely, with my autistic hunch, in the Rogers Park neighborhood, just near the Wilson CTA stop, and I saw a lot of dancing extras in the film - probably 200, children and adults.In the soul food caf\u00e9 scene, there was the great \"Queen of Soul\" herself, known\nfor the R-and-B vintage hit, \"Respect\"-yea, Aretha Franklin. When I saw her in the flick doing \"Think\", which was a stepped-up version of this R-and-B number (coming from her own soul album called \"Aretha Now\" in 1968), I realized how modernized American rock-and-roll can be in that period of start of the 1980s decade. The extras in the film who sang as backup singers in \"Think\" (I did not know who they were) reminded me of Diana Ross' Supremes. I realized that the Blues Brothers were there to try to increase the forces in the backup band-they found Mac \"Guitar\" Murphy who played guitar, and \"Blue Lou\" Marini, who played the saxophone, who also worked at the soul food watering hole.But my favorite other song from the soundtrack was \"Sweet Home Chicago\",\nwhich was actually based on a 78 single by blues singer Robert Johnson, on Vocalion Records, which was recorded in 1937 in Gunter Hotel, in San Antonio, Texas. I also found out that John Belushi, one of the Blues Brothers, said something about the song attributed \"to the great Magic Sam\". But in 1980, I did not know Magic Sam as a blues artist-I only knew a bit of Koko Taylor, who was starting to become one of the greatest Chicago female blues artists on the planet. So I realized-after digging into Wikipedia, that Magic Sam was the stage name for Samuel Gene Maghett (1937-1969), who was born in Mississippi. The name might mean that he might have been a boxer, but he was not-just simply a blues artist.So, from learning a lot from this song's past, I found out that this the song \"Sweet Home Chicago\" started its history in Texas, and then moved into the Mississippi Delta, so the blues song that Magic Sam performed had a bit of a Mississippi Delta Blues twist.That is a lot to say for just one blues song that was famous not just for Chicago's blues enthusiasts-but all other blues enthusiasts in the United States. When I saw \"Sweet Home Chicago\" being performed live in the movie with the Blues Brothers twosome, their backup blues band, and an energetic audience in the scene at the Palace Hotel Ballroom-looks like I have to make an educated guess that what was an acoustic blues number was modified for today's 1980 audiences-they wanted the song more powerful, with more instrumental forces than just a guitarist-singer-and that is I think what the audience got.Then, I learned about other songs that were R and B favorites in the flick. I hear\n\"Soothe Me\" by Sam and Dave, which is a West Coast Swing type of R and B number (a shuffle), and then, the up-tempo, funky, 4/4 \"Hold On, I'm Comin\" by the same group with the Memphis Horn section and rhythm guitar, in the scene where the Blues Brothers were pulled over by a state trooper.There was also classical music in the supposedly \"all blues\" flick---the \"Ride of the Valkyries\" by Richard Wagner, from the opera \"Die Walk\u00fcre\", which I heard in the climax of the final car chase just near the end of the movie. And there was a song that was never credited generally in the film which sounded classical-a Viennese waltz by a string and piano ensemble still remaining unidentified at that time, but it was called \"The Romantic\" in the key of A major, composed by Joseph Lander (1801-1843), which sounded something like a salon type of waltz, but not in the way Johann Strauss Jr. Would\ncompose; this song appeared in the Chez Paul restaurant scene in the flick. (\"Chez\" - is a French term that un-literally means \"at the home of\"). This was when Jake and Elwood try to find that maitre'd, Alan Rubin, who had the character \"Mr. Fabulous\", who was a trumpet player.",

The number of devotees and \"average Joes\" who spend their days quoting The Blues Brothers from front to back to back to front is, for a lack of a better word, scary- but that's another movie! Dan Aykroyd and John Belushi are perfect as brothers Elwood and Jake who for the majority of the film are on the run from too many police officers to count. Despite the spectacularly over the top, but nevertheless entertaining car chases, rock and rolling music numbers and supporting roles from such prominent musicians as Ray Charles (who in a slide-splitting moment hangs a poster upside down) and James Brown and Chicago scenery, the real stars of the film are Aykroyd and Belushi of Saturday Night Live fame. It's a shame though that Belushi died soon after and the sequel turned out to be a mediocre effort. Nevertheless, the Blues Brothers continues to attract new audiences.Many factors can be attributed to its success, including the now classic black suits and sunglasses look, as well as the music, though being a Musical/Comedy, it was and always will be humour that ensures its freshness for many years to come.",

            "content": "I've been looking through meta critic ratings and have discovered that The Blue Brothers got some pretty mixed reviews upon its release, at times being called vapid and full of senseless car chases and too much escalation of the police forces and the other forces after the two blues brothers. I suppose there is a little bit of truth in that the car chases are a touch long and you do start to question why the entire police force of Chicago is after Jake and Elwood but not to the extent that deserves such staggering critique as 40/100 or 60/100 ratings.Robert Ebert gave The Blues Brothers a 3 out of 4 star rating but I agree with him that the larger extent of the hyperbole within the film does work with the logic the film has created (to paraphrase Ebert) and that there is \"moments of grace\" within the car chases, such as when the Illinois Nazi car soars off the brink of an unfinished bridge to the sound of grand and weightless classical music. I think of the critics of the time Ebert has probably given the fair opinion although by the cult status The Blues Brothers receives today the praise Ebert gives seems remarkably understated.You have only to listen to the soundtrack and watch Jake get marched out of Juliet prison to an unmistakable but subtle bass riff within the opening sequence to realize there is great filmmaking taking place, from the angle of the shots to kinetic editing and the synchrocity with the \"fat sound\" of the varied blues music soundtrack.The composition of the shots when Jake meets Elwood in his POS bargain police car is epic, it has a momentous feeling as does much of the film as a comedy with a \"mission from god.\" I do believe that the exaggerations of the forces pursuing the duo only serves to affirm their numerous escapes as from god, which does make sense with the pair's aim to save a Catholic orphanage from eviction.Stellar soundtrack, but I have said that about other films like Blake Snake Moan which I have given a lesser score of 8/10. What capitulates The Blues Brothers is it's greater consistency of concept and execution and satisfying arc of set up, rising action, climax and resolution. It's a clean arc with great pacing and a satisfying tease and pay off which films like Blake Snake Moan (an entirely different film genre, but also built on blues) allude to but don't fulfill in as convincing a way as The Blues Brother which, though a comedy, does have its own logic.Fun to read about all the cameos I did not quite realize, such as a much younger c. 1980 Steven Spielberg as the clerk at the tax office at the end. Also really enjoyed seeing familiar musical greats such as James Brown, Arethra Franklin and Ray Charles take the scene (also Cab Calloway who I am not as familiar with). They have small acting roles and they are very good really, especially Arethra Franklin. I cannot believe that the studio producers at the time wanted to get other more current 80s singers in those roles because they didn't think these musicians had appeal because they didn't have recent hits. Like, omg. They are the soul of the film (or their music legacy is) and make it great. Wow, The Blues Brothers would have been a very changed film if it did not stick to its roots like it did. I was reading on Wikipedia that Cab Calloway wanted to do a disco version of his signature Minnie the Mooch (?) song and I'm glad those involved were insistent he do his heyday big band version instead. There is that kind of homage to the brilliance of the past that gives The Blue Brothers its integrity and lasting quality as a collection of musical favorites led by two musical brothers who are themselves a tribute to the past and as cool and smooth as the spirit of the blues behind wayfarer glasses. I don't think there could have been better quality control of the material included and excluded and edited together, and whoever is behind these technical graces does deserve a shout out because it's the marriage of the editing of the images with the timing of the music that does give the film its meaningful, sharp pace.As someone who builds playlists I have to say there couldn't have been a better order and mix and I've earmarked a few songs to be included in my next list from this film.Everyone has their tastes, but today I learned that many critics can incredibly heavy handed about what they choose to criticize and The Blues Brothers is a supremely enjoyable film with the right mix of confidence and skill to make it not just entertainment but artistic achievement and worth studying if you are a filmmaker. Many times a film may not deserve the highest of ratings but in my estimation this one does and I am glad it is enjoyed so fondly and that it did quadruple its initial $25 million budget (equivalent of $80 million today and considered very high) to make $100 million when considering home viewing purchases over time.Fantastic, adored and adoring blues tribute film with as much energy and dance numbers to truly represent the type of joie de vivre contained within a fabulous Ray Charles songs, the many twists in phrasings and trilling crescendos like jumps in the air. I think the musicians and more importantly the music is justly honored in this film which, while a comedy, gives The Blues Brothers a remarkable sense of tastefulness. Like yeah, this is the good stuff.And to top it off, this is a comedy with great writing. The script was written by the actor who plays Elwood. He wrote it like a novel with a massive amount of pages and prose rather than screenwriting. It was his first script which another edited into screenplay form and I think the dialogue is fantastic and the names hunorous (Mr. Fabulous comes to mind). If you turn the captions and read you'll see there is a lot of thoughtfulness to the dialogue, a kind of intelligence that is also dry and amusing, like the difference between \"bullsh-ting\" and \"lying.\" (The difference is between doing something not wrong and wrong.)Anyway I like this film, and I'm glad the end result has outlived the stories of the belabored production and the actual concerns about the appeal of the film according to Wikipedia, which says the film distributors went with limited rather than full movie theater release because they expected box office failure. I don't know if The Blues Brothers was a box office triumph, but for sure it is a classic and I love it.",

            "content": "To date, The Blues Brothers remains the only instance in which after watching a movie for the first time, I watched it again the very next day. Several viewings later I've come to the decision that The Blues Brothers is my favourite film comedy.The Blues Brothers is some of the most fun you'll ever have with a motion picture. Just one incredibly fun set piece after another whether a car chase, a musical number or comedic showcase. Choosing a favourite moment? Now that's difficult. The portion of the film which has me in the most hysterical fit is the sequence at Bob's Country Bunker. Having a blues band with two lead singers who are as urban as it gets at a redneck bar in which everyone thinks they're the night's country music act and everyone is oblivious to this pink elephant in the room has me laughing just thinking about it (not to mention quite a dig at country music), and what country song are they able to play to the crowd? Why the theme song to a TV show of all things. In regards to the film's musical numbers, let's just say I bought the two-disc movie soundtrack very soon after watching the film, which gave me a solid twelve months of continuous music listening pleasure.The brothers Jake and Elwood epitomise coolness with their black suits, sunglasses and stoic nature. Yet despite the film's protagonists being criminals, The Blues Brothers is a film of strong moral character. The film makes fun of the antiquated nature of Catholicism while still celebrating faith-based virtues which can transcend to the secular viewer. Jake and Elwood have to save the Catholic orphanage they grew up in but are forced to raise the money to do so by honest means and at the end of the day, they do get punished for their bad deeds. Also, I have to ask, do churches as fun as that portrayed in The Blues Brothers actually exist in real life?What other movie which has more reverence for its location (the only other film which instantly pops into my mind is Rocky with Philadelphia). Right from the opening shots of the industrial landscape, the city of Chicago is gloriously captured. For the best moment in the movie which captures the grit and grime of the city of Chicago is the scene on Maxwell street with John Lee Hooker playing cut to shots of stalls selling music tapes and other artefacts; such a beautiful sequenceThen there's the film's final car chase. I haven't seen every famous movie car chase but I would happily place a wager that there is no other car chase in the history of cinema better than this. I believe a truly great action sequence is one in which there's a sense of danger that someone can get hurt or even killed. Here I'm not only fearing for the fictional characters but also the real-life cast and crew. The number of cars involved and carnage that ensues is unprecedented; Grand Theft Auto years before Grant Theft Auto existed. With so many action movies featuring gargantuan levels destruction which means nothing and has no impact, they should take note from The Blues Brothers on how to make action sequences in which you can actually feel the weight and heft of everything from the screech of every tire to the sirens of every police car whizzing past the screen.The lack of logic in The Blues Brothers only adds to its enjoyment. For example, the very obvious plot hole in which The Good Ole Boys arrive hours late at the country bar with no explanation would likely downgrade most movies; here it just enhances the surreal world inhabited by the Blues Brothers. My favourite illogical moment is the Illinois Nazi's demise on the unfinished freeway; it makes no sense in the most wonderful way. The 80's was pretty much the decade for epic, large-scale comedies such as The Blues Brothers. Only then could a film like this even get made.",

Filled with humour, action, music and more, this movie will stay in your heart forever. The musical showcase, like many other reviewers have said, is just amazing, and will have you singing and dancing along. No wonder this is one of the best selling soundtracks as well. I'll admit to having it on my iPod. You just cant watch the Blue Brothers without remembering all the classic jokes and one- liners, and the songs that come along too. Some of these are standard quotes in my house, when a particular moment will arise. I mean, that's probably enough said - quoting Blues Brothers in your own home? Definitely a movie that's been watched many many times! From the start when the Peter Gunn theme comes on, til the end when Jailhouse Rock is being performed, you'll be all things on the edge of your seat, singing, dancing, laughing and begging for more. After all, The Blues Brothers are on \"A mission from God\".",

Technnically The BB shows many \"flaws\" and imperfections, even in the editing, but these do not reduce in any way the extraordinary audio-visual & on-soul impact.

            "review_title": "Blues Brothers is Rollicking Good Fun and My All Time Favorite Comedy",
            "content": "Let me start out by saying that The Blues Brothers is my all time favorite comedy. It's delightfully over the top, brimming with good-natured energy, and set to some of the twentieth century's best music. Of all the Dan Akroyd/ John Belushi team ups, this is by far the best. The plot, such as it is, involves the efforts Jake (Belushi) an Elwood (Akroyd) to reunite their old band, the Blues Brothers, for a concert that will raise the $3,000 dollars needed to save the Catholic orphanage where they grew up- hence the famous tag-line \"We're on a mission from God.\" But this is easier said than done. Their former band mates aren't that easy to convince, or even track down, gigs are hard to come by, and they manage to get on the wrong side of everybody from the police to the Illinois State Nazi Party. Of course this is really just the setup for a series of hilarious hi-jinks and upbeat musical numbers. And boy do they ever manage that. Jake and Elroy are two of the funniest characters ever to appear on screen, and the roles that Belushi and Akroyd were born to play. Jake is cynical, wisecracking, and a total ham, while Elwood is utterly deadpan, serious but even tempered no matter what the situation. The thing about these two is that they're a couple of the nicest shmucks you'll ever meet- and at the same time a pair of irredeemable crooks. They pull every trick in the book, from giving false addresses (with excellent payoff) to sabotaging police cars. And these guys are the very definition of chutzpah. They actually manage to pass themselves off as the scheduled country western band at Bob's Country Bunker. And when Jake is confronted by hiss jilted would-be bride (Carrie Fisher), his pitiful recitation of clich\u00e9d excuses borders on the unbelievable.The rest of the cast are also superb. Rays Charles, Aretha Franklin, James Brown, and even Cab Calloway show up as a preacher, a used instrument salesman, and so on. And of course they sing. Their numbers- including Respect, Shake Your Tail Feathers, and Minnie the Moocher- are truly spectacular and will likely have you tapping' your toes and singing along. John Candy Does puts in good work as a bumbling, nice guy detective, and Twiggy is mildly amusing with the old dumb blond shtick, but the best casting decision just might be Carrie Fisher as Jake's psychotic ex. She's not the psycho-killer type, in which case there wouldn't be any joke, but from watching her Star Wars we know that she knows her way around a gun, so the character is believable.Another of the film's main strengths is that it can find humor in anything. In writing the script, Akroyd and Landis have managed to inject comedy into situations as mundane as Jake's release from prison or Elwood quitting his job at the shaving cream factory. One of the funniest scenes is the brothers' meeting with the Penguin. Usually, a meeting with the nun who helped raise the main characters would be handled solemnly. But here, it's an expletive filled scene of snowballing slapstick comedy.This movie also succeeds at something many critics have held to be impossible. It has car chases that are actually funny. Now I agree that there's nothing particularly humorous about watching cars chase each other at high speed. The humor comes from the characters' responses, whether it be Jake and Elwood's disinterested commentary on the stores they're plowing through, or Candy's priceless line after embedding himself in the side of a semi truck. The filmmakers also understand the comedic potential of absurd overstatement, as with the Nazi bigwig's jaw dropping plunge.What The Blues Brothers is really about though is the music. Besides the previously mention legends of R&B, the brothers themselves provide much of the soundtrack. What many people today don't realize is that the Blues Brothers were an actual chart topping band. There's no lip syncing here; the actors are in fact playing their own music, and boy is it ever good. Their rendition of Wilson Pickett's Everybody Needs Somebody to Love is one of the most energetic, feel good pieces of music ever released. I truly envy the crowd that was packed into the Palace Hotel Ballroom for the filming of the main concert.Any way you look at it, this movie is pure fun, plain and simple. Every high energy song and dance, every physics-defying chase, every one-liner and deadpan piece of dialogue is wonderfully entertaining. The Blues Brothers will have you laughing in delight from beginning to end.",

This is the one and we all watched it together. After almost 17 years it was mostly fresh.I understand that this movie was spun off the characters created on Saturday Night Live. However, I was not watching SNL when Belushi and Aykroyd were doing these characters so I don't have that frame of reference. My viewing it was simply as \"a movie\" with no background. While I found it somewhat interesting, in all I cannot call it a good movie, only an interesting and manic one for seeing the deceased John Belushi in a memorable role. Plus many cameo roles for some of the best entertainers of the time. But almost all of it is extreme silliness with a few nice production numbers.There is only a very simple story here. John Belushi plays Jake Blues and it opens with his release on parole after 3 years in prison in Joliet, Illinois, just outside Chicago. He is met by his brother Elwood, played by Dan Aykroyd, driving an old retired police car. Reminding Jake of his promise to visit their old Calumet, Illinois orphanage when he was released, they discover that it will be closed unless $5000 can be raised in 11 days to pay back taxes. Being \"on a mission from God\", the whole movie is about raising that money. Since Jake and Elwood are always on the fringe of deep trouble, the movie also turns out to be a sequence of several chase scenes.A running theme is a mysterious woman (Carrie Fisher) using various weapons and bombs to try to kill them. Then there are the Nazi demonstrators. Aretha Franklin is the owner of a food joint, she does a song. They go to the music store where Ray Charles is the owner, get instruments. In another scene Cab Calloway entertains. At the end we see Spielberg as a city official. Then there was Twiggy showing up at various places. Lots of brief cameos of famous people.I don't begrudge anyone who adores this movie but for me watching it is mostly a chore. Not really the kind of movie I enjoy.",

            "content": "Comedies have changed quite a bit since 1980, for good or ill. The Blues Brothers is a movie which really couldn't have been made in any other era without suffering somewhat. Much if not most of the humor is at the expense of authority, a common theme in comedies of any era but especially the late 70's and early 80's. The audience laughs at car crashes and the humiliation of police officers and the wealthy. These things are not the reason the movie holds up after all this time.It's the love. The people who made this movie clearly loved American music in all forms, from gospel (The Old Landmark) to jazz (Minnie the Moocher) to classic R&B (Shake Your Tailfeather and Everybody Needs Somebody to Love) to rock and roll (Jailhouse Rock) to of course blues (Sweet Home Chicago). There's even a country tune! This movie is a tribute to all American musical forms either created by or molded by African Americans and the affection for the music pervades the film.The Blues Brothers also holds up because of the many, many cameos from faces familiar and faces rarely seen. In short, it's a fun way to spend a couple of hours, and even if you don't laugh - you probably will, but even if you don't - you'll almost certainly be tapping your foot oryour fingers.",

There driving through Dixie Square Mall with people screaming and running and there smashing into stores and the police are chasing them. To end it all there was that one cop who was upset about his watch. Besides Dan Aykroyd and John Belushi there were plenty of other great people in the movie like James Brown, Aretha Franklin and Ray Charles. This is truly a movie that will go down in history.",

I run it again every so often for kicks... just last night, in fact. The whole subplot of getting the band back together is a lot of fun. The band members themselves are interesting characters... a couple of real stand-outs, like Dunne and Alan Rubin as Mr. Fabulous, but they're all good even though most of them don't have that many lines. The shot of the falling car is spectacular... this ain't CGI, folks.

It is filled with memorable scenes and not least lines.There are plenty of stars, not least musicians like Ray Charles, Aretha Franklin, James Brown and Cab Calloway (all doing good songs), but also unexpected names like Carrie Fisher, Frank Oz and Steven Spielberg. They matter less to the movie though. The music is the most vital part.And the humor. Belushi and Akroyd do their stone-face act just right through all bizarre things that happen to them, more or less caused by themselves.The two most important things to make you truly love a movie are a great opening and a great ending. This one has them both and keeps the tempo in between as well.Too many comedies, American in particular, rely on cheap under-the-belt \"humor\" like fart jokes, crude sexual implications and the like. That is not present here, apart from some mild rude language that is perfectly called for and used in a fun way. The script just doesn't need junk to fill it.A few scenes were cut that were re-introduced in the DVD version, but only one of them (parking the car in a weird place) has any importance.Simply one of the best comedies ever made.",

Along the way, they run into various blues greats, neo-Nazis, irate cops, even more irate country/western bands and bar owners, a murderous ex-girlfriend, SWAT teams, and even the Army. The whole plot, such as it is, goes completely over the top on a number of occasions, including several car chase scenes that must surely set a record for most cars wrecked in a single movie. What works? Several moments, most notably when Jake and Elwood show up to play a cowboy bar, start off with \"Gimme Some Lovin\", and, after a, shall we say, negative reaction from the audience, they quickly shift gears and start playing country songs. Not that it matters much, the crowd throws beer bottles at the band as a sign of both approval and disapproval. Luckily the band gets to play behind a screen of chicken wire. Also, Carrie Fisher is hilarious as the rejected girlfriend of Jake, who goes on a one-woman mission of vengeance. What doesn't work? Pretty much everything else. For starters, the \"Blues Brothers\" are basically two dorky white guys trying to cash in on a black musical thing. Also, the film relies far too much on the aforementioned car chases. Whoever had the contract to supply cop cars to the filmmakers must have made out like a bandit. Final analysis - If you really love the music of blues artists like Ray Charles, James Brown, and Aretha Franklin, you will no doubt put up with the nonsense just to hear some great music. If not, you can laugh at a pair of goofballs trying to resurrect a dead band and running into numerous ridiculous situations along the way. It's far from great comedy, but it has its share of laughs. 5/10",

The stunts are amazing, the acting excellent, and the plot is cohesive and well thought out, as ridiculous as it is. This is a classic film for the entire family, even though there is some profanity, a few off color jokes, and a lot of overt violence that is all played for laughs.

The Blues Brothers has a few of the best car chase scenes in movie history. John Landis deserves credit for his wonderful direction.This movie is a perfect mixture of comedy, musical and action.

The film runs a little long with several over-the-top action/chase sequences in the mix (a shopping mall sequence in particular), however, the film is engaging even when the action goes overboard thanks to the pure motivations of the title characters who genuinely believe that they are on a divine mission. Interesting religious parallels also crop with the reuniting of band members akin to gathering apostles and at times it seems nothing short of miraculous how they survive certain ordeals (like a phone booth blown up). Landis films the material in quite a stylish manner too; the German Expressionist lighting as they ascend the stairs to the head nun's office is an excellent touch; same goes for the low camera angles as John Belushi leaves prison in the opening scene. A fun supporting cast helps too, such as a blind Ray Charles shooting potential shoplifters in his music score, Aretha Franklin getting a good musical number of her own, Henry Gibson delightfully eccentric as a pompous neo-Nazi and Carrie Fisher adding a lot of zest as a 'mystery woman' out to kill the pair for reasons only revealed towards the end.",

Belushi and Aykroyd live and breathe the roles of Jake and Elwood, the buttoned-down, stern-faced suits who suddenly explode when the stage lights fire up, characters who seemed instantly destined to transcend the spectacle of their own story. Their plot is, really, embarrassingly simple - regroup the band, put on a big show, save the orphanage - but the strength of the brothers, the ad-lib mastery of their vessels and a staggering wealth of guest appearances mold it into a behemoth that's barely able to squeeze into a comfortable running time. It may seem random, zany and baffling at times, but it's impossible to look away and eventually everything comes together in a loud, reckless, picture-perfect finale. Viewed in a modern setting, it doubles as a fascinating glimpse at city life in the twilight of the 70s - especially when the boys lead pursuing police on a frenzied high-speed chase through the heart of a bustling shopping mall.

On top of that, it's incredibly inconsistent in terms of tone and target audience. It depicts a pair of jazz-loving musicians as they travel across the country on a \"mission from God\" to put their old band back together and make enough money to save their church-led childhood orphanage. However, this story is constantly interrupted by bizarre bursts of wanton destruction, with car wrecks and explosions that would still be over the top in even the most action-packed of action flicks. It also becomes increasingly absurd, with blatantly silly filmmaking and overtly weird plotting overtaking all else in its finale. The film is far too long for what it is, only really picking up steam as it approaches its final act. It finds its most success when it capitalises on its cameo-stuffed cast to provide its generally enjoyable song-and-dance numbers, with the tongue-in-cheek tone it takes during these sequences making the most sense for the material. The two leads tend to do a good job at delivering their quietly ridiculous dialogue in a nicely deadpan way. Plus, although they're wildly out of place, some of the car chases are fast-paced and impressively destructive. In general, though, the picture is a mess. It is entertaining (especially as it moves towards its finale), but it's also rather boring towards the beginning and never quite comes together as a cohesive experience. 5/10",

Needless to say, lots of harmless carnage and laughs ensue as the Blues Brothers make enemies with the Cook County Police, the Illinois Nazi Party, a rowdy country band, and a mysterious woman whose only mission is to see the boys dead. John Landis directs one of the few worthy films based on an SNL sketch, with a great script by Landis and Aykroyd. One of the most hilarious comedies of the past twenty-five years, featuring an unforgettable combination of blues music, cameos, and car chases. The illogical points in the script only make it funnier. A must-see musical comedy.",

            "content": "OK, the title here is probably disingenuous. I live in Chicago, a city that doesn't allow you residence unless it can confirm that you love \"The Blues Brothers\" and \"The Untouchables.\" So this review is coming with a fair amount of cultural bias out the door. So I'm just going to drop the honest part right now and tell you flatly that this is bias. It's likely the most bias review that you'll probably ever read.Franklin singing in a famous Maxwell street diner (now defunct) but still, that's pretty Chicago right there.And, of course, if you've ever lived by the L you get the joke about the trains running past you every couple of minutes at a deafening pitch.And there's the fact that I grew up in McHenry County when it was still a rural country podunk county and they still gave us the nod.It's all Chicago, and it's all Chicago with a line up of Blues cameo's that the world has never seen before and sadly will never see again, especially as the genre has faded to near obscurity with the generations after X.There's something splendid about it. It's a comedy that has never stopped reminding me of home. I can even sit down with my wife and watch this movie in our Chicago apartment and feel a nostalgia for the Chicago that used to be, for the Maxwell Street that used to be, and I can watch it when I'm out far from home and it acts as kind of a comfort piece.And, what I've found out in my life is that the love for it is international, or at least The Blues Brothers transcended borders and has a faithful following in Germany as well.It's a movie about The Blues and about Chicago, and don't listen to the nay sayers, even our home town boy Buddy Guy will tell you that the Blues aren't an exclusively Black thing, it's not an exclusively an American thing, they are an exclusively music thing. There is a reason, after all, why people say that they \"appreciate\" the Blues. And I don't think anyone is in a position to argue with Buddy Guy about this.So take this however you want. It's a funny musical with better music than musicals tend to have... or it's a beloved tradition that comes with your zip code. Either way it's something that only the most jaded and cynical among us won't enjoy and love.",

There is the famous duo, John Belushi and of course Dan, who play Joliet Jake Blues and Elwood Blues. Of course, the scene starts at the infamous Joliet Correctional Center where Jake is going to be out on parole for an armed robbery conviction, with Elwood in an old police car to pick him up from prison walls. Their mission (where the famous \"Mission from God\" phrase occurs over 5 times in the flick)---to get the Penguin (which is actually Katherine Freeman, who owned the St. Helen of the Blessed Shroud Orphanage in Calumet City, Illinois), called that because she was dressed in white and black like a penguin (she is actually a nun) to pay a property tax bill of $5000. When the Penguin refuses to pay that money (because she considered the brothers as sinners who were not able to repent) and kicks both of them out of her room and out of the building, the only way they can accomplish the mission of raising funds for paying the tax bill is \"to put the band back together\"---The Blues Brothers Band, of course.Carrie Fisher, who plays the \"Mystery Lady\" or \"Mystery Assassin\" (the latter is better), had other plans. She had a death wish on the famous two-man duo.She had a variety of weapons for the assassination of the Blues Brothers, which the two men dodge bullets, explosions, and fire by this hard-headed lady. The first assassination attempt used a rocket launcher at the transient hotel's entrance where the two men were; the next was detonation by dynamite of a transient hotel, thwarting even the police dynamic entry to the room where the two singing men slept. The next attempt was using a flame thrower at a propane tank near the telephone booth where the two man were talking in. The tank blows, causing the booth to go up and then tumble down, but the two men survive all that. Then, getting out of the Palace Hotel Ballroom in a water logged tunnel, the lady uses a semi-automatic weapon but the two men's verbal pleadings saved them from murder.",

Carrie Fisher is on hand, as well as a lot of old musicians, like James Brown, Aretha Franklin and Ray Charles.I found myself laughing throughout this movie, sometimes uproariously. The best parts are the Catholic orphanage scene, the black church sequence, the diner scene, the country bar episode and any part with Carrie Fisher trying to utterly annihilate Jake (Belushi) and anyone who just happens to be in his general vicinity.For me, though, the film's a little bit overlong and should've been cut by about 15 minutes. For instance, they could've easily cut the music store scene since it's not as good as the other musical sequences, but then Ray Charles would've been cut. Nevertheless, this is a great comedy.The film runs 133 minutes (extended cut 148 minutes) and was shot in the Chicago area.GRADE: A-",

This movie has the perfect combination of Music, action, and comedy, that propels it along at a perfect pitch. The story is fun and engrossing the direction is spot on, kudos to Mr. Landis, and the cast couldn't be better. John Belushi and Dan Aykrod play the sunglass wearing soul brethren duo with a minimalistic approach that really adds to their performances. The real genius of the casting in this movie has to go to the supporting cameos. The producers were smart enough to get the legends of soul, like Areatha Franklin, James Brown, Ray Charles, and most notably the very underrated soul pioneer himself Cab Calloway. There contribution really enhanced the entire tenor of the film. The musical numbers in this movie are just downright infectious. Even if you have never been a fan of old soul music you wont be able to not tap your feet or sing along with the movie. I personally believe that the best musical number was when Cab Calloway did \"Minie the Moocher\". Having him dressed up in that white tux and the stage all lit up, transported us back to the hey-day of soul music. As for the Blues Brothers themselves, I can understand how they had sold out concerts back when this movie came out. They really had something, musically, there. The action in this movie was very surprising. Remember that this was decades before the invention of CGI. They must have trashed of 100 cars and countless buildings during the making of this film. But, man did it ever pay off. Remember the scene where the cop cars all end up crashing and piling up on one another. It was executed so fearlessly and boldly that you almost felt like it was like watching a perfectly executed dance or gymnastic maneuver. All in all if you have not scene this movie...you should!

            "content": "Okay, they aren't really brothers and they don't really play the blues. And it's not really much as comedy, only intermittedly amusing, albeit spiced with some winning musical numbers that owe more to southern soul, gospel, and Tin Pan Alley than electric blues.But \"The Blues Brothers\" has fun and makes sure its audience does, too, goofing on its snarky cool, its demolition-derby aesthetic and setting into play a whole subgenre of film comedy, the \"Saturday Night Live\" knockoff.Joliet Jake (John Belushi) and Elwood (Dan Aykroyd) find a higher purpose for their natural criminal bent when the orphanage that raised them is threatened with foreclosure. In order to raise the necessary funds, the Blues Brothers must reunite their old band and play a gig, while avoiding the angry attentions of an ex-girlfriend, a country-music band, Illinois Nazis, and most of the greater Chicago law enforcement community.Along with Lorne Michaels, I have a grudge with this film in that it delivered the death blow to the original and best \"Saturday Night Live\" cast by depriving it of two of its stars. Belushi and especially Aykroyd were amazingly versatile TV performers, and putting them in a movie wearing dark sunglasses and poker faces feels almost criminal.A lot of the scenes, especially those involving the Nazis and the country band, but also the excessive car chases, bog the film down, as does the coke-fueled narcissism of the two leads. But two things not only save but redeem the movie, the music and director John Landis.The musical numbers are the film's reason for being, not only because they spotlight some terrific performers and celebrate their art but for the way they electrify the film. Watching James Brown belt out a gospel number is great, but what sends it over the top is the kinetic dancing of his congregation, and the way Jake gets carried away by it. Likewise, the Blues Brothers themselves may be cruising as comedians, but they had something to prove as musicians and do so with some gut-bucket vocalizing from Belushi (listen to him sing that opening number, \"She Caught The Katy\") and spastic hoofing from Aykroyd to the beat of \"Sweet Home Chicago\" in a raucous, blue-lit music hall.That leads to Landis, who keeps the film moving so fast you overlook the limp plot and blind alleys, and gives it a sheen that complements the aggressive score. When Ray Charles takes out a pistol and shoots at a small child, or Daley Plaza fills up with enough armed personnel to pacify Iraq, it works because Landis makes clear that we are dealing with a world only slightly connected to reality. Seeing the extended version that comes with the 25th Anniversary DVD really shows how Landis squeezed every bit of energy he could out of a script that Aykroyd wrote during his SNL downtime and could have been another \"Nothing But Trouble\" in less steady hands.Belushi has one great scene, when he's confronted by Carrie Fisher as his M-16-wielding ex-fianc\u00e9e. \"I remained celibate for you,\" she sneers, taking aim at his head. Then Belushi whips off his sunglasses for the only time in the movie, and fixes her with a look that melts her heart as well as yours, for a talent who died too young.But the best comedy is in the music, Jake and Elwood dancing hand-in-hand across a stage and the great Cab Calloway in tails performing his signature number from the 1930s, \"Minnie The Moocher.\" Aretha Franklin's lip-synching, too, though that's unintentional comedy and it's only fair to add that she gives the best acting performance of any musician and most of the actors.Like another film comedy from the same summer made with SNL vets, \"Caddyshack\", \"The Blues Brothers\" is flawed but fun, worth seeing at least once.",

The film also has some great lines that are legends, in my opinion, in the history of great film lines (\"We're on a mission from God\") not to mention a long line of fabulous songs such as the one I mentioned before \"Minnie the Moocher\" and a great rendition of \"Shake those tailfeathers\" by Ray Charles. Do not let the pathetic sequel \"Blues Brothers 2000\" put you off this film, it's a classic, and it's a real shame that films like this are so rarely made. Enjoy it!",

            "content": "When first having seen this at an important screening because I was connected to producers and was not that into all the mayhem and hoopla the film was getting and was not a big fan (personally)of John Belushi who I knew from having to be around him On The Rox above the Roxy when he was such a damned bore and I was not into his and Dan's Blues Brothers performances on SNL. In the 90's I began to see it again on big screens, TV and did a complete turnabout in my opinion of not only the film, but Belushi as a talent. I admit to discovering his musical prowess, his timing, his unique personality and HOW he worked with superb Dan Ackroyd, who is still one of the best actors and performers we have in film.Two more different \"types\" worked so beautifully together and made great music and moved better than any duo in film history. Besides reassessing Belushi---I still am not a big fan of his brother-- the actual film is one of the greatest casting masterpieces of a century of film in any category. I originally loved Aretha's \"bit\" which should be released as instructional tape on acting,dance and body movement. Her singing and the number just still steal the film......almost as much as the number in the church which is ATOMIC! The script went though changes and when I first thought of the film as a big waste of autos (pre CGI)and needless destruction.....now, I just laugh and love what Bernie Brillstein green lighted as the producer and give him most of the credit for the making of this hilarious concept and his using of Carrie Fisher,Gospel music, Kathleen Freeman, and dozens of actors who all contributed in special ways in cameos and part of the story line. This film should have a major re-release to show the new crop of film directors and students that originality can not be emphasized enough when making the predictable films of today.

            "content": "(NOTE: This review is for the unrated, extended version) SNL movies have a really spotty track record, and often feel like sketches dragged out to feature length. I haven't seen any of the SNL sketches for the Blues Brothers, but this film adaptation hardly feels like the other SNL movies I've seen. There is a decent amount of plot (really, too much) and it is consistently funny throughout. Not only that, but it has one of the best soundtracks ever. The gist of the story is that after Jake Blues is let out of prison on parole, he teams up with his brother Elwood and sets out on a mission to get the band back together in order to raise money to save the orphanage they were raised in. Meanwhile, a diverse assortment of people are all on their trail. What really worked for me was the chemistry between Dan Aykroyd and John Belushi (may he rest in peace), because without that central relationship the movie would just fall flat. And, in contrast to many other SNL movies, THE BLUES BROTHERS felt really cinematic in terms of scale and spectacle. It was excessive at times, but never less than entertaining and always funny. The film also has a ton of cameos from famous artists and other comedians. Some of them felt a little superfluous (Carrie Fisher, I'm looking at you), but again, there was always something to laugh about or sing along with. One scene that I liked in particular was the Brothers' first gig in a Country/Western bar (and the aftermath when the real band shows up). It showed some on-the-spot thinking on the band's part, as well as musical diversity. Outside of that scene, my favorite musical number is probably Cab Calloway performing his signature song, \"Minnie the Moocher.\" Even at his advanced age, he still had the voice and moves. However, the film isn't perfect. Keeping in mind that I watched the extended version, which is about 15 minutes longer, there definitely was a surplus of material, and not all of it was necessary. I didn't really notice too much where footage was added (having not seen the theatrical cut), but there was one short scene where Elwood quits his day job that shouldn't have been added back in. First, in the previous scene he already mentioned he was going to do that. Second, he wasn't wearing his trademark shades. I also feel like Carrie Fisher's role in the film, while funny, didn't have the best resolution, at least compared to the other running gags. Also, at nearly 2 1/2 hours, there are parts that drag. Ultimately, though, THE BLUES BROTHERS is a highly entertaining, funny film that has plenty of action (and comically absurd amounts of property damage), great music and solid performances from everyone involved. If you haven't seen it yet (what few of you there might be), consider watching THE BLUES BROTHERS your own personal \"mission from God.\"",

I guess someone with more awareness of the blues genre would better appreciate this casting and consider the film to be an absolute masterpiece. Regardless, since watching Blues Brothers I've been influenced to listen to several of the featured artists on Spotify and have indeed listened to \"Everybody Needs Somebody to Love\" on repeat.Therefore I can't think of another film that has such an impact on a specific music genre in the same way The Blues Brothers does. The reason I couldn't rate it any higher than 8/10 comes down to its comedy, which isn't not funny, but leaves a lot to be desired. There weren't so many laugh out loud moments as there were skits that forced a barely audible \"ha\". I'd describe the humour as silly and dry, which other viewers may be more tickled by than myself.

            "content": "First off, from my point of view, the film is about the reunion of two brothers, separated by incarceration, and their struggle to not end up back in prison. At the beginning of the film we witness Jake (John Belushi), getting released from prison and picked up by his brother, Elwood (Dan Aykroyd). This opening sequence climaxes in the reunion of the brothers - a feeling of \"the boys are back\" - inciting a curious itch in the mind of the audience; who are these two? Why was one of them in prison? Are they hardcore criminals? and if not, will they be able to stay clean on the outside or will they screw up and end up back on the inside? But from there, the story structure crumbles.Three inciting incidents in rapid succession; within the span of a few minutes we have been experiencing three major turning points in the story, and my question is: \"why?\". It deprives us off the satisfaction we feel after something has been truly earned by the protagonists, and it makes us numb when scene after scene is yelling meaningful change in our faces. A story needs pacing, build-ups, foreshadowing and THEN rewards, when we at least expect it. And I'm sad to say that this film fell flat on that aspect of story telling.Another problem with several inciting incidents is that we, as an audience, will most likely get confused over what the central story is really about. Is it about staying out of jail? Is it about saving the catholic home they grew up in? Is it abound the band? What is it about? \"The Blues Brothers\" flitter all over the place, which is merely saved by the filmmakers' conscious choice to amplify that flitter - creating a satirical compound of excess action-packed meaninglessness.Just a few more pointers...In all great films, nothing progresses if not through conflict. Whereas in \"The Blues Brothers\", the story progresses through cute little dance numbers, posing no real risk to the protagonists, which, again, gives us no sense of satisfaction, simply because the protagonists were rewarded too easily.And lastly, the one rule for creating dual-protagonists is that their actions and reactions must be in direct conflict with each other, or display contrasting counterpoints, in order to add substance to the story and make their lives more complex, deepening their dilemma. But the Blues Brothers behave basically as if they were the same person, meaning that one of them is painfully redundant to the story.As you can understand, I've got many issues with this film. So many, in fact, that I'd have to re-watch it if I want to disclose them all... but I'm not to keen on seeing \"The Blues Brothers\" again anytime soon. The film was funny though, from time to time, and the star-packed cameos were nothing short spectacular, which is why I gave it 6/10.",

From the brilliant over the top humour to the neat way Divine Intervention destroys the Illinois Highway Patrol without hurting anyone, to the Fantastic music, this has to be my favourite movie of all time. I first saw this on a Friday night after a hard week at school, and it just made all the worries disappear with its wonderful, easy humour. Favourite part?  When they're in the office building, and the SWAT truck pulls up, the blokes pour out the back going \"hut-hut-hut-hut\", and then we see one bloke by himself abseiling, quietly going \"hut-----hut-----hut\" to himself.

Even though I have constant disagreements with some of my movie-going buddies, I think this movie stands out MILES AWAY from the rest in the comedy genre! It's unique and it screams of the American culture of the soon-to-be-past millenium! In short, this is one extremely special movie which I will definitely never EVER forget to the day I expire!This is the first John Belushi movie I've seen, and I can only imagine the wackiness of SNL of the days gone by! Dan Aykroyd is as brilliant as ever, much younger and slimmer than his Ray Stantz character in \"Ghost Busters\" that he did later on. Aykroyd is one of the best performers out there today, he is simply entertaining! And Carrie Fisher is EXCELLENT!! Forget Star Wars, this is Fisher at her best!The best thing about the Blues Bros is the smart inclusion of classic great musicians of yesteryears, cleverly mixed with zany dialogue and some excellent songs, and some of the wackiest slapstick-style comedy ever, and the result is so beautiful you almost forget the stoooopid story-line! You just gotta BE IN THE MOVIE to truly enjoy it! I'm not much for music OR movies, but the Blues Brothers is one movie you cannot afford to miss! Keep an eye out for Spielberg :-)Oomph!-meter (from 5): ****1/2",

            "content": "One Rainy Sunday I frequented my local theater (The Midway) of Forest Hills not expecting much. The other movies on the marquis just didn't interest me at all. I took a chance on the Movie the Blues Brothers with little expectations. This Movie stars to original cast members of the popular long running TV show Saturday Night Live shown weekly on the NBC network. A comedy staple for decades but best remembered for two of its most prolific players John Belushi and Dan Aykroyd. I went inside expecting bad acting . I got it! I also expected mass destruction i.e; car chase through a shopping mall. I witnessed that! I also saw anomalies of a weird nature, Nazi's going to Wrigley Field and business meetings in a steam room. I observed that! I also viewed Fashion model exemplar \"Twiggy' getting ripped off in a rural gas station and Carrie Fisher doing demolition throughout the movie. I also witnessed that! What i didn't expect was an afternoon of classic musical and dancing numbers that would rival any musical that I've seen in the past. Let me set it up for you. Our story begins with Joliet Jake Blues (John Belushi) leaving Prison welcomed by his brother Elwood played by Dan Aykrod. To Jake's horror he sees his brother Elwood picking him up in a Mount Prospect City police car which Elwood claims '\"They were practically giving them away at auction.\" Elwood goes on telling him he traded away the original Blues Mobile, The Cadillac for the police car equipped with a microphone which was the selling point for Elwood. The brothers first stop is the orphanage where they were raised as they meet with the cold abusive Sister Mary Stigmata played to perfection by veteran actor Kathleen Freeman. The Sister has a problem. The bank will foreclose on the orphanage due to back property taxes owed in the amount of $5000. The boys step into action as they sit in on a Gospel sermon at the Triple Rock Church led by the Honorable Reverend Brown. .Yes, James Brown the Godfather of soul. Jake breaks into dance during the service and with stunt double does back flips. Jake has an epiphany. Assembling the Blues Brothers band back together and raise the 5000 to save the orphanage.. As Elwood exclaims \"Were on a mission from G-d\".. The problem is that the band members are scattered around the city of Chicago. One scene worth watching is when the boys enter an upscale Chicago bistro in their dark filthy suits, stetsons and shades as they are downright rude and offensive to the clientele . Unfortunately the maitre d is Big Al (Alan Rubin) their former lead trumpet player who refuses to return to the band. The boys reek havoc until Al concedes. This movie slowly and effectively transforms into musical numbers. The likes of the legendary Ray Charles as he runs a downtown music store with a keen sense of smell to ward off shoplifters. Performances by Aretha Franklin and Cab Calloway make for top notch entertainment with the city of Chicago as the backdrop in this wild and fast moving comedy/musical. The Boys generally dodge the police authorities, a country band , the American Nazi party (Chicago Branch) led by Laugh-in poet Henry Gibson and a deranged ex-lover of Jake the mystery woman Carrie Fisher. . So order up an Orange Whip plus four whole chickens and plain toast. If you look closely you'll see cameos by Paul Ruebens and Chaka Khan. Steve Lawrence and John Candy round out the ensemble. Sit back and watch the Blues Brothers perform and remember there're are still somethings that make us all the same. You. Me. Them. Everybody!!!",

And because of this they both decide to get there old blues band back together to raise the money, and so intern they go on a wild goose chase across Chicargo with meeting such famous blues performers as James Brown, Ray Charles, Aretha Franklin, John Lee Hooker and Cab Calloway.

The music (yes it is blues, just not delta blues), the comedy, the cameos, the car chases and the story are all superb. It is just too bad it didn't do as well at the box office as it should have. Belushi and Aykroyd are comic geniuses and their chemistry on screen is bar none. Some of the musicians, while not comedians, have some great scenes as well (Ray Charles, Aretha, etc). It was also quite exciting to see some of the gold of blues such as Johnny Lee play a role. The book gives a little more history into the \"brothers\" and the band but the movie did a good job. I believe this movie has some of the greatest \"movie lines\" of any made and the settings and locales fit well.

You don't even have to hear them say anything particularly funny to laugh at the sheer sight of the wacky duo lined up against one another, wearing the infamous clothing and sunglasses. And since their appearance on \"Saturday Night Live,\" and then later in their milestone feature film, they have infiltrated society.\"The Blues Brothers\" (1980) is, and will remain as far as I see it, the funniest \"SNL\" skit adaptation to ever hit the big screen. The problem with adapting characters from 5-minute skits on \"Saturday Night Live\" is the fact that they are just that -- 5-minute skits -- and are not substantial enough to merit any type of further focus. Backdrops are not needed -- all we need are quirky characters with distinguishing traits or gestures that will make us laugh.\"The Ladies Man,\" \"The Coneheads,\" \"A Night At the Roxbury,\" and \"Superstar\" are all examples of material stretched too far -- basically just skits multiplied by their original running length some 15 or so times. In fact, there are really only two or three feature length movies with \"SNL\" characters that are any good. I love \"Saturday Night Live,\" but even I have to admit that some things are not meant to be turned into a movie. I'd rather see a compilation of the character's best moments on the show hit the big screen as opposed to a weak plot-driven film about them doing many unfunny things a quarter as funny as anything on the television program.\"The Blues Brothers\" has a great plot (considering it's an \"SNL\" film) and a great pair of characters. Jake Blues (John Belushi) has just been released from prison, greeted by his taller (and more slender) brother Elwood (Dan Aykroyd). They visit the old Catholic home where they were raised as children by \"The Penguin,\" and are instantly thrust into a mission to save the orphanage by raising a ton of money before it is due to close.How will they do this? Reunite their old band, of course! But it won't be easy, because in the process they get entangled in the affairs of a Neo-Nazi and a heavily armed woman (cameo by Carrie Fisher). They also get entwined in a bunch of musical sequences with blues legends such as James Brown, Aretha Franklin, and Ray Charles. (John Candy also stars in this film, and in John Hughes' masterpiece \"Planes, Trains and Automobiles,\" he did the \"mess around\" to Ray Charles' song on the radio while driving an awful car.)It's all in the name of fun, of course. Oh, and in the name of God. Quoting Elwood, \"We're on a mission from God.\" Not exactly a laugh-out-loud line of dialogue, but the more you think about it, the funnier it becomes.All my readers are probably aware of the fact that I absolutely love \"Saturday Night Live\" and all its actors. (Well, most of them.) Especially the older posse of actors such as Bill Murray, Chevy Chase, Dan Aykroyd, Steve Martin (frequent guest host), John Belushi, et al. They're like dear old friends and every time I see them on old reruns of the television show I get instant nostalgia. When you become a fan of \"Saturday Night Live,\" you enter a sort of small group of friends you've never even met. You just somehow feel very close to the actors and their friends. John Landis, the film's director, was one of those close friends of Dan Aykroyd like Harold Ramis.The Blues Brothers are two of the best characters to ever come out of \"Saturday Night Live.\" We've seen a lot of characters like Mango and Mary Katharine Gallagher lately, but the best characters are the fondest -- Wayne and Garth, The Lounge Singer, The Coneheads, The Cheeseburger Guy, The Blues Brothers. And just about any character Steve Martin plays.I can't explain why I enjoy \"Saturday Night Live\" so much -- is it the humor? the acting? the familiarity feel? -- but I can say that I DO love it, and I love \"The Blues Brothers.\" Sequels can become nasty things or splendid things, and \"The Blues Brothers 2000,\" which reunited Aykroyd and Landis (the director), was a failure. A compilation of musical sketches and a terribly recycled plot, it was a sure sign that The Blues Brothers themselves worked not only because of Elwood but also because of Jake, and \"The Blues Brothers\" the movie worked not because of a recycled plot but because of an original one. (And here's advice for the filmmakers: never, ever replace John Belushi with John Goodman ever, ever again.)I am sure that anyone who enjoyed \"Ghostbusters\" or any type \"SNL\"-alumni film will absolutely adore \"The Blues Brothers.\" I mean, this is the stuff legends are made of. Jake and Elwood Blues, two of the most familiar faces of all time. How can you not laugh at this film? It's impossible. Yes, it's a bit long, and yes, you have to sit through some blues music; but they're The Blues Brothers. What else would you expect?5/5 stars.John Ulmer",

He also made the famous \"Thriller\" vieoclip for Michael Jackson (almost a short movie).\"The Blues brothers\" is his best known film. It is about two brothers (played by John Belushi and Dan Aykroyd) that try to resurrect the band they once were playing in to raise money for the orphanage where they grew up. Most of the other band members are however married and settled and less than enthusiastic.In this respect the film resembles \"Young adult\" (2011, Jason Reitman) in which a former high school beauty queen thinks she can win back without difficulty her former boyfriend, also married and settled in the meantime. The difference is that \"Young adult\" is a drama movie, and the attempt is a complete failure. \"The blues brothers\" however is a comedy and ultimately the brothers succeed. After all they are \"on a mission from God\".The film ends with a spectacular scene of the benefit concert of the reunited Blues Brothers band. Before that the story is rather meager, consisting mainly of car chase - and music scenes.The car chase scenes are a parody and exaggerate this type of scenes seen in detective movies. This exaggeration however does not make these scenes any funnier. I am not a big fan of this type of scenes. Suggesting a lot of action, but being rather predictable and boring in reality.Of high quality are the music scenes. Could it be otherwise with appearances of James Brown, Aretha Franklin and Ray Charles? Highlight in this respect is for me the scene in which the band (because of a mix up) has a performance in a country and western bar. They quickly realize that a change of repertoire is necessary and start to sing \"Stand by your man\" (1975, Tammy Wynette). A rather cynical change of repertoire, because the brothers are doing everything in their might to convince their former band members to leave their wives.Over the years \"The Blues Brothers\" has become a cult movie. If you go to a dress up party in black and white, sunglasses and fedora hat, everybody knows who you are. Depending on your posture they take you for Jake Blues (John Belushi) or Elwood Blues (Dan Aykroyd). As always with cult movies there are attempted successions (not of the storyline (that would be a remake), but of the look, feel and mood). In this respect I would like to mention \"The Comittments\" (1991, Alan Parker) and, to a lesser extent, \"O brother, where art thou?\" (2000, Joel and Ethan Coen).",

When they visit their former Catholic grade school to ask for spiritual advice, an irate nun, knowing their criminal activities, warns them not to come back until \"they redeem themselves\". Also, the school needs money, desperately. Not long after that, the two attend a church service where the charismatic preacher (the one and only James Brown) inspires them to get their blues band back together and make money for the Catholic school. After locating all of their former bandmates, some reluctant to re-up or having spouses who discourage them (Aretha Franklin is one), they get their first gig. Unfortunately, due to miscommunication, it is at a country bar. Thinking quickly, they launch into the Rawhide theme and Stand By Your Man. After several concerts, they get in trouble with the law and are almost caught by the angry former galfriend (Carrie Fisher) of Jake's but he charms his way out of it.

Basically 'Joliet' Jake Blues (John Belushi) has just been released from prison, and he and his brother Elwood Blues (Dan Aykroyd, also writing) return to the orphanage run by nuns where they were raised as children. They find out that the church has stopped giving support to the orphanage and that unless they can pay the $5000 tax on the property it will be sold, so they go the church for some inspiration. Jake sees the light and suggests that he and Elwood should reunite their old blues band and raise the money by selling out all seats in an arena gig. So they set off on their \"mission from God\" to find their fellow band members to join them, and they don't care what it takes, they won't even stop for the police or any old enemies. One by one Jake and Elwood do find the members of the band, while being chased by the cops, an army of Nazis and an enraged Mystery Woman (Carrie Fisher), and of course having a few song and dance scenes with old friends. After all are reunited, and playing a small gig under a false identity to warm up, they are ready for their big concert where they do indeed manage to sell all seats, and they play with great reaction, and manage to get away from the cops in the audience. The final scene sees Jake and Elwood speeding to the tax office with the \u00a35000 to pay for the orphanage, and they do manage to do this before being arrested for all the damage and chaos they caused in their journey.

Belushi and Aykroyd are fantastic as the criminally minded but ultimately likable brothers, the cameo appearances by legends of music and film makes for fun viewing, the plot is simple and there are a fair amount of laughable moments (including possibly unintentional), and of course the song and dance sequences, including the memorable \"Everybody Needs Somebody To Love\", are great fun, a most watchable musical comedy. It was number 24 on The 100 Greatest Musicals, and it was number 12 on The 50 Greatest Comedy Films. Very good!",

The premise is rather lame, especially given that Belushi and Aykroyd are terrible singers--two white guys calling themselves \"the Blues Brothers\" is an insult to any real blues singers! The movie's plot is slap-dash, seemingly thrown together to exploit a throw-away sketch from SNL. This movie started the long trend of bad movies based on throw-away sketches from SNL. I realize it is meant as a live-action cartoon, but so many seams are left showing that suspending one's disbelief becomes a chore. Many people love this film because they can't watch it objectively. They see only their favorite comic actors from the past. It's like that Top 40 hit you loved from high school that just embarrasses you now when you hear it. I saw it when it first came out, and it was over-hyped then and hasn't aged well at all. Most professional movie critics see _The Blues Brothers_ for what it is: a mediocre star vehicle that crashes like an old Chicago police car flying out of lower Wacker Drive.",

I just love seeing all those police cars getting smashed up. BTW, did you know that TBB held the world record for the most cars destroyed in one film until it was surpassed by its own sequel? (I got that from Wikipedia, which has great articles on both the movie and the band.) My favorite scenes are early in the movie. The first is the scene with Sister Mary Stigmata, aka \"The Penguin\", where she's whacking them for using foul language. The other is the scene where the brothers find themselves stuck in a line of cars stopped on the road. When the ask a passing policeman what's going on, and find out it's a march of \"the f#&%ing Nazis\", Jake utters my favorite line in the movie, \"I HATE Illinois Nazis\", and they charge the Bluesmobile straight towards those f#&%ing Nazi bastards and force them to jump off the bridge. Every time I watch that scene, I shout, \"YES! Illinois Nazis, IN THE WATER!!\". Now, I'm a tolerant Christian man, and I belong to a large multicultural church, and they teach \"hate the sin, not the sinner\", but I feel EXACTLY the way the Blues Brothers do about Nazis of all stripes. This movie really has it all! I could go on and on about this musical farce, but space is limited, so I'll just say YOU MUST SEE AND BUY THIS MOVIE!!",

Along their \"mission\" they encounter every obstacle known to man and overcome them all.  The musical performances are outstanding and the line-up of singers makes the movie into a musical concert.  It delivers over 2 hours in non-stop action and laughs and must be on everyone's \"must see\" list.  You can literally watch this movie hundreds of times and never get bored. This is classic Belushi and to watch him perform his magic on the screen is enough to make you watch this one over and over.

Belushi and Aykroyd were at the top of what was hip, funny and cool at that time, but played characters that were far from trendy. For better or worse, comedy is no longer delivered as it was here. It delights my senses musically, visually and comedically.Ray Charles with a pistol. Parishioners doing leaping back flips, 20 feet in the air. A flashmob song and dance in a soul food joint. A traffic menace warranting the involvement of ALL cop cars in Chicago. Ridiculous.

It isn't carefully plotted, and it doesn't have very subtle acting in it. But if it isn't good, it somehow manages to get around this by being, very simply, GREAT. Of course, it's largely the music that does it. Imagine seeing and hearing Aretha Franklin, Ray Charles, John Lee Hooker and James Brown in the space of about two hours, not to mention the Blues Brothers' own fantastic R & B sound! And there's Cab Calloway's Minnie the Moocher....But maybe even more than the music, it's the tone of the whole thing. How rare, how moving to see R & B and soul and the blues openly worshipped (even if a bit wackily)! How satisfying to see country music, which has caused me so much aesthetic agony, sent up so hilariously! That scene in the country and western bar, where the Brothers sing Rawhide has got to be one of the most delicious bits of satire I've ever seen! And imagine Twiggy being stood up by an evil smelling bluesman. What a fantasy for all us blues-loving losers!

I had to turn around and watch, as it even caught my attention with my back turned.  After watching for 5 minutes, I turned it off and left.  Not because I didn't like it, mind you... but because I could see that the \"bad words\" had been dubbed over (obviously), and it ticked me off that they did this to a movie that was so entertaining to me.

            "content": "The story of the Blues Brothers is the classic tale of the underdog rising above their former self and helping those that need their help. This movie takes this form of storytelling and strings a crazy, comedic adventure through it. The Blues Brothers, Elwood Blues (Aykroyd) and and Jake Blues (Belushi) are two unlikely heroes that travel around searching for their lost band-mates so they can pull off one more gig to raise money to save the orphanage where they grew up. Along the way they encounter trouble, sometimes intentional and sometimes not. It just seems to find them. Aykroyd and Belushi are an hilarious and wonderful pair as they spout their lines back and forth. Their physical comedy is even better. The film as a whole nails physical comedy on the head with its car chase scenes especially. This movie has a bit of a script issue as one can forget what exactly the purpose of the Blues Brother's intentions all along are. While watching I forgot about the Orphanage as the movie had completely centered around the band and the Blues Brother's shenanigans. All accounted for, I'd rate this movie a 8 out of 10. It's an amazing comedy and timeless. Aykroyd and Belushi are lovable idiots as the Blues Brothers.",

When they perform in the film it is classic stuff. You can watch this film over and over again just to listen to the music. To listen to James Brown, Ray Charles, Aretha Franklin, Cab Calloway and the Blues Brothers. The songs are all brilliant. And the ending that must have been one almighty wage demand. It must have cost a lot of money to destroy all the glass, cars and just everything. Then add that to the cameos from huge stars and the actual cast in full. But one of if not the best bit is the car chase. All those cars piling up the chase in the mall, through Chicago and all the cars getting destroyed. Falling from a great height and creating a huge hole in the road, crashing into trucks, flying into lakes it has everything. Humour, action, fabulous music, what more do you need in a movie. At two and a half hours might test the patience of some people but it was totally worth it. One of my favourites, one for the ages. Great writing by Dan Aykroyd and John Landis and great directing by Landis. And another great way to remember Cab Calloway, Ray Charles but mainly John Belushi.",

            "content": "You read that right.     There's no point in going over the plot. If you're reading this review, you already know the movie most likely. Besides being riotously funny, the characters from \"The Penguin\" (the late great comic actress Kathleen Freeman) to Jake's homicidal ex-girlfriend (Carrie Fisher in a particularly inspired role. I even like the name of her hair salon \"The Curl Up And Die\") are beautifully realized. There is not a lame second in this opus. And the MUSIC! WOW!!!   Damn the plotholes and full speed ahead. This film, along with \"The Producers,\" \"Stripes,\" \"Animal House\" and maybe \"Caddyshack,\" this is one of the most flawlessly realized gut-busting comedies of all time. Add to this the amazing line-up of musical talent from John Lee Hooker, to Ray Charles to the mighty Cab Calloway to the Queen Of Soul Aretha Franklin doing another fabulous rendition of \"Think,\" this is a tribute to R&B and soul the true American music as well as a perfectly thought out exercise in funny!   What makes it all the more remarkable is that it holds up so well. I still have favorite moments I look forward to when watching this film and some are just as simple as the \"Cheese Whiz\" toss to the old man in the divy hotel alongside the El to the C&W waitress proudly telling our heroes that \"We have ALL kinds of music. We have country AND western.\"    I just wish I could rattle off those long lines with all sorts of references like the great Dan Ackroyd. I also consider myself privileged to have MET Belushi and the late Gilda Radner (who, sadly, has not had a single good film in her repertoire. She deserved better) There's something I can share with my grandkids.    And I agree with Elwood. I too hate Illinois Nazis - unless they are going over a cliff.    If you haven't seen this movie, BUY IT and you won't regret it....unless you don't like great music and funny comedies...then maybe you ARE an Illinois Nazi, in which case....",

            "content": "Blues Brothers... now why does that name sound familiar? Some might remember them from a recurring musical sketch on NBC variety series \"Saturday Night Live\", but growing up in Europe - I was never exposed to those sketches. I had to dig deeper and finally discovered that I heard of them from a highly unlikely source - Nickelodeon. Yes, during the mid-2000s, they ran a sitcom called \"Drake & Josh\" that featured an episode called \"Blues Brothers\" that not only ended with them creating a tribute to the Blues Brothers by performing a rendition of \"Soul Man\" (the song was not featured in the film), but, BUT, also featured a short scene from the movie! Sounds crazy, I know, and this rabbit hole and the revelation took me on a path of nostalgia as it was one of my favorite sitcoms when growing up.\nThe one thing that really caught my eye was the way the budget was used. If I had the time, I'd count how many cars they crashed in this film, how much glass was shattered, and how many costumes were used for both the police department and the soldier outfits. Speaking of that, what seemed like a tame comedy got out of hand with ridiculousness as the movie progressed. I didn't mind it as it fed off the charm of our two protagonists and their almost oblivious reactions to the whole ordeal going around them gave that ridiculous chaos a life on its own.\nAnd let's not forget the memorable stars this movie featured - John Belushi and Dan Aykroyd did a good job playing Jake and Elwood respectably, Carrie freaking Fisher (RIP) as the mysterious woman, who turned out to be a former love interest of Jake, was probably the most random one but hey, if you have a chance to sign big names like that, I'd go for it too, even Aretha Franklin... sorry... THE ARETHA FRANKLIN was featured as the caf\u00e9 owner and she even performed! I might be geeking out since I'm a fan of her but that scene sure made my jaw drop and my heart might have skipped a few beats... and so did RAY CHARLES! \"Twist it\" was a really good song and the whole music was filled with good and fun musical acts, which is probably my favorite part of the film, along with the charisma and comedic presence of the Blues duo.Overall, I really enjoyed this movie. It might not be a spectacular piece of work cinematography-wise and the plot is a bit wacky for my taste, but hey, it made me feel good, and seeing as I am still stuck in quarantine, I just miss concerts even more now. Just one show like that could recharge me again.",

What makes this movie so great is the humor, there's things people do for no reason, their chased by everyone, and by the middle of the movie. You believe this is a normal day for the two. I only have one problem with the movie, it does tend to feel a little longer than it is, but the comedy and the music make up for it. I give this movie a 3 & 1/2 stars out of four.

            "content": "The plot is about 2 guys who are on a mission to collect certain sum of money to rescue the Catholic home by reuniting their old music band. This can be a good plot for a buddy-comedy, road movie, musical, or action. Actually the movie is all of these genres together. Well.. it has part of every one of them to be precise!It could have been some mix in the name of farce. But instead, it was mishmash done farcically. For instance, the 2 leads don't have an irony between them; being more like the same person divided in 2. They both made enemies so easily along the way. Some of the songs, if not all, got nothing to do with the events, so they were against the pace's flow. And the movie ends up as kind of dull comedy or anarchic musical.Further, the massive, very showy, climactic action sequence is too good to be true, yet stands alone, like a huge ending for another movie. It catches up with the boom of the car's long chases of that period, post-Smokey and the Bandit (1977). Though, the movie isn't an action also, it just utilizes elements of it.It goes like this: Comic Scene + Song + Action Scene, then the same of that, again and again, being about nice elements played repeatedly and absurdly. So, eventually, it's just a show, a cinematic variety show. It even reminded me of Pepe (1960), another variety show in form of a movie, with entertaining episodes and thin plot. And despite the fact that it's nearly disassembled, it managed to provide fun.Director (John Landis) enjoyed showing us how to play a slight script with craze, using comedians, iconic singers, and big cadres to hide any defects in it. The (John Belushi) radiation is highly dangerous; he can own the screen by doing nothing. Some small touches and gags were memorable. I loved the first sequence where (Joliet) is going out of the jail in holy moment-like, (Belushi) and (Aykroyd) come out of the hotel's debris dusting down their suits indifferently, the end's blowing up and clever chases. Let alone singing the finale song by all the movie's great singers in one last montage. And the idea of (Carrie Fisher) as obscure mad sniper who hunts the 2 leads with machine guns, bombs, and rockets was super funny.As for the songs, (Theme From Rawhide) and (Minnie The Moocher) were the most entertaining episodes; like paying 2 separated homage during the \"show\" to the old TV, and the old Jazz too. I don't think that (Joliet) and (Elwood) song at the end was that impressive to earn all of that success, but maybe it was in the way they performed it, so this movie itself; it proved how a movie can make a large bubble out of small gum.By the way, I thought that the movie could have had more audience if it wasn't R-rated. And it's R for the slightest reasons ever, namely it could have been better without couple of sexual shots and swearing words. So it sounded like PG-13 movie that got the wrong R sprinkle!In another dimension, that could've flopped hard. It happened already when they repeated the same formula later in Blues Brothers 2000 (1998) without (Belushi), the sudden impact, and in lower action too (How Dare They?!). Simply, they disrobed it from what hides its own imperfections.Anyway, for a last verdict, The Blues Brothers (1980) is like (Carrie Fisher)'s character in it; childish, explosive, jest.",

The film is hilariously funny and there is a natural chemistry between John Belushi and Dan Aykroyd that makes their roles as near perfect as possible.The car chase and subsequent crashes are among the most impressive that I can remember and the supporting cast offer up some great songs, most notably in my opinion Ray Charles.I would include this in my top 10 films ever, and as someone who normally hates musicals with a vengeance, that says a lot.",

            "content": "There's never a normal day for Jake and Elwood Blues (John Belushi and Dan Aykroyd), but \"The Blues Brothers\" is film that has never been told before and that a lot of the ideas must have had a lot of second guessing from the people behind the scenes to determine if this film is going to work out. Both Belushi and Aykroyd made these iconic characters famous from their days on \"Saturday Night Live\" and now they have managed to make the big time to the silver screen of Hollywood. What makes this movie so unique we get an origin story of the brothers as it was revealed that they were raised in a very strict orphanage in the West Side of Chicago and by virtue of osmosis, they learned the blues and from the opening scenes, the brothers reunited after Jake was released from jail at a Joliet pen.The story is quite simple in its delivery. We see Jake and Elwood pay a visit to their old orphanage only to discover that the place needs $5000 to pay off back taxes.or else the orphanage will be shut down for good. This leads the brothers to reunite the band for a one night show to help raise the money to save the orphanage. The Blues Brothers travel around the mostly darker regions of Chicago like a Van Buren flophouse, Maxwell Street and Wacker Drive. They make pit-stops at a Soul Food Diner owned by Aretha Franklin, a music store owned by Ray Charles and a Baptist Church run by James Brown.Along the way, the brotherly duo manage to anger off a lot of people which includes a country/Western group, the Chicago PD and a group of Nazis who were in the middle of a demonstration. What this movie succeeds is that it successfully manages to recapture news events from the time period and incorporate it into the film. So while the cops, the country band the Nazis are after them, there is music playing in the background which some nice energy flowing into the story to add excitement to the chase scenes.With the plethora of musical talents added in the cast The Queen of Soul Aretha Franklin was the one who had the best scenes as the owner of a restaurant serving classic Soul Food. Cab Calloway though catching on in age is still as slick as her his, strutting in style with his exotic suits reliving his days when her performed Minnie the Moocher. There are quite some entertaining moments of them performing like when they were at a country bar and were surrounded by wire mesh so that they don't get doused with beer bottle while they get booed off stage.When it comes down to it, the whole film itself is one big epic chase. Even going so far as Jake and Elwood take control of a used police car that zooms through suspended bridges almost like it has a mind of its own. The movie takes a real liberation in the uses of the location. There is no safe zones when the Blues Brothers are in pursuit. They can be seen everywhere from train tracks to overpasses through subway tunnels and even through the Daley Center. The 12 car crash pileup can easily be regarded as one of the most impressive displays of stunt coordination.But underneath all the car wreckage and the millions of dollars in property damage, this film works on all levels. Director John Landis who seems to love to take risks succeeded in making movie magic while paying off all dividends for all the damage he's done to the city and the cars. Performance wise Belushi and Aykroyd were spectacular in their respected roles as self-destructive laid-back cynics who carry their class with suave charisma and style that fits the settings of the movie. This film is filled with crazy stunts, cool music and plenty of car wreckage for a wonderful night out.",

            "content": "What happens when you combine hilarious comedy, great music, wild vehicular stunts/crashes, and an all-star cast? It means that the fabulous Blues Brothers are in action! Written by Dan Aykroyd & John Landis, and directed by the latter, \"The Blues Brothers\" was a successful attempt at transferring a Saturday Night Live skit into a theatrical motion picture. The plot of this extraordinarily funny movie, with many memorable lines, involves brothers Elwood Blues (Aykroyd) and Joliet Jake Blues (John Belushi), who just keep on running afoul of the law as they reassemble the members of their rhythm & blues band in order to earn some decent money. (If you haven't yet seen \"The Blues Brothers\", DON'T read the rest of this commentary!)Here are my favorite highlights from this classic action musical comedy. Jake and Elwood are hilarious as they keep swearing at the nun (Kathleen Freeman) and receive a good share of smacks. The action-packed police car chase inside the shopping mall is equally hilarious. Aretha Franklin as the soul food caf\u00e9 owner gets a chance to show some spunk in this film (prior to her much-too-long feature number \"Think\"). As the police & the Good Ole Boys chase the Blues Brothers away from the Palace Hotel, the lead singer/driver for the Boys (Charles Napier) realizes that Elwood secretly epoxied the gas pedal on the Boys' vehicle, so the Good Ole Boys unintentionally \"go for a swim\". While hordes and hordes of police officers, soldiers, and S.W.A.T. teams pursue the Blues Brothers (so overwhelming it's ridiculously funny), Elwood and Jake quietly hang out inside an elevator listening to a laughable Muzak version of \"The Girl from Ipanema\". Ray Charles (owner of Ray's Music Exchange) and the Blues Brothers Band do a fine performance of \"Shake Your Tailfeather\". At Bob's Country Bunker (\"Chicken wire?\"), the Blues Brothers Band applies some quick thinking to satisfy the restless patrons (\"That ain't no Hank Williams song!\") and offers a nice rendition of \"Stand by Your Man\". At the Palace Hotel Ballroom, Curtis (Cab Calloway, aka \"Mr. Hi-De-Hi-De-Ho\") performs a swinging \"Minnie the Moocher\", and the Blues Brothers do my favorite version of \"Sweet Home Chicago\". And finally, at the Triple Rock Baptist Church, the Reverend Cleophus James (James Brown) leads the congregation in a lively, unrealistically boisterous song titled \"That Old Landmark\".That's about all I can write about \"The Blues Brothers\"; so spectacular and enjoyable is this musical comedy from 1980. All of the actors, stunt people, and crew did a hell of a fine job with all their hard work.",

The gags, are fantastic, ranging from quick one liners to brilliantly well handled visuals.  John Landis' style and camera control is impeccable and blends perfectly wiht the mood of the film.  The finale scene is also a groundbreaking feet in combining unbelievable action with insanely clever comedy.  The way in which all the actors and actresses don't take it too seriously adds to the light heartedness of the piece and still makes me smile every time I see it.

            "content": "I was 13 years old when I first saw 'The Blues Brothers', and ever since that chilly December day in 2002, I've been hooked.This clever, madcap comedy stars the late John Belushi as Jake Blues and Dan Aykroyd as Elwood, two men who provide the vocals and harmonica for their powerhouse blues band, the Blues Brothers. After getting out of prison for armed robbery, Jake reunites with his brother Elwood and they head back to whence they were brought up, an orphanage that is about to have its doors closed unless the money needed to save it can be scrounged up. Henceforth, the 'Mission from God' was born.There is no shortage of greatness in this movie. That includes cameos, the script, the music itself and the acting. Add in a few outrageous car chases, some bitterly ticked-off Nazis and more cameos by Blues greats than you can count, and you'll really have your tail feathers shaking'. Belushi and Aykroyd can certainly carry a tune in a basket and there is no doubt that they are talented, and you have to give them credit: they delivered a fire-powered performance that I think could've been Grammy-worthy (but that's just me personally). Every number they cover is a toe-tapping, hum-worthy tune, and the albums they've put out (Made in America and Briefcase Full of Blues) are just as catchy and soulful as the movie soundtrack itself.The individual personalities of Jake and Elwood are a pleasure to follow along with throughout the film, and each band member offers at least one great, laugh-worthy line that you can't help but quote every now and again. The smart appearances by Ray Charles, Aretha Franklin and Cab Calloway also generate a lovely feeling of bluesy nostalgia and a reminiscence of the good ole days when music was actually high-quality. While it is really a shame that Belushi (who happens to be my favorite comedian) passed away two years after this film was released, there is no doubt that his memory will be fondly upheld in what is unarguably his best work.The most famous of all the quotes is the classic 'We're On A Mission From God'. Trust me, whatever the mission our suit-laden heroes were in, it was definitely fulfilled.My grade: A+, 10/10",

There are two possibilities in such an event: they're either not real musicians, or they've just never seen The Blues Brothers!The Blues Brothers is the musical of the musician. No other film gets so close to the truth of what life in the business is like for an actual musician, and no other captures the essence of what real music forms, the Blues especially, are about. Music is not about a bunch of gutless trendies following whatever the PR at Sony tells them to follow, it is about the creative dreams of ordinary men and women, just like the people listening or viewing. The scene outside the Soul Food Cafe is a perfect representation of this: an improptu band performance outside the cafe, attended by the average Joes that they made the music for.Of course, there is still a demonstration of the corruption and stagnation that has become inherent in the music industry, but rather than flaunting it as just something we have to accept, this film shows that with enough determination and work, it can be overcome. One day, I hope to get everyone who's been raised on the garbage they play on the radio these days and stick them in a hall, then play Minnie The Moocher at them. I'm sure the shock of hearing real music with a dozen musicians playing a tight, intricate rhythm in two different speeds will shatter the ease with which they can listen to repetitive noise. As a musician heavily influenced by everyone from The Blues Brothers to Frank Zappa to Black Sabbath (the real Black Sabbath, anyway), I am counting on it because I can see how awful society will become without real music.Alas, Cab Calloway, John Belushi, and John Candy are no longer with us to see that the legacy of this film is still as strong and defiant against stagnant radio drivel as it was in the early 1980s. Calloway in particular gives a performance that shows what a mistake society is making by throwing real music on the scrapheap. The performance of Minnie The Moocher convinced me in five seconds flat that I wanted to be a musician. Now that the DVD is out, grab it and watch it on a widescreen unit with the Dolby Digital 5.1 soundtrack turned up to full bore... you'll be a better person for it.",

John Belushi puts in his greatest role ever as Jake Blues, the big (but short) brother of Elwood Blues who is sensationally played by Dan Aykroyd. After Jake (John) is released from Jail after a 3 year jail sentence, His Little (But Tall) brother Elwood (Dan) picks him up in a \"POLICE CAR!\" After being rejected by their female mentor from the orphanage they grew up in, they are inspired after a church service which their step-father (Cab Calloway) told them to go to. The Church service was conducted by James Brown, and the brothers set off on their MISSION FROM GOD to put the band back together, grab some bread and put it into the orphanage to redeem themselves. This would save the orphanage from being closed down, and getting the money was a very tough assignment. Their are hilarious moments, great duels with the cops that were chasing after them and wonderful music with a big list of guest stars, including Ray Charles, Aretha Franklin, The Blues Brothers Band and many, many more!

            "content": "I saw this during it's initial theatrical release and have seen it many times since. This movie was far too of an ambitious project. When you have so many characters and musical numbers and musical legends and comic legends built around a thin main plot and weak subplots the entire picture collapses upon itself. This is still a funny and clever movie but it's just too cluttered. As it begin with some funny sight gags with Frank Oz taking inventory of Joh Beleushi's belongings and Beleushi throwing the cigarette lighter to Dan Akroyd's Bluesmobile out of the window it had some nicely paced comedy but as the film evolved into a musical with an overabundance of soul and blues legends it disintegrated into a movie that couldn't make up it's mind to be a comic adventure or a music video. The car chase scenes and mega-multiple car crashes were way too long and overboard and added nothing to either the comedy or music direction that this film was torn into going. In supporting roles, Henry Gibson, Carrie fisher, John Candy, and Frank Oz were all very good while Kathleen Freeman was excellent. Music legends James Brown, Ray Charles, Cab Calloway, Artetha Franklin, Chaka Khan, John Lee Hooker, Pinetop Perkins, Steve Lawrence and 60's fashion model Twiggy are all featured here as well as the Blues Brothers Band featuring former Memphis Stax records musicians. Cab Callowy and Aretha Franklin were very good in their roles but too many musicians spoiled the soup. Some delivered some exceptionally bad acting too. Director John Landis had success with Animal House and Kentucy Fried Movie before The Blues Brothers and would enjoy sporadic success as a director in the 80's and 90's with such films as An American Werewolf in London, Trading Places, Twilight Zone: The Movie and Coming to America. Longtime Landis associate film editor George Folsey Jr. really did a good job on what must have been a monumental task of editing the footage that went into this epic production to make some sense out the the mess that Landis conjured up to give us The Blues Brothers movie. This is not a bad movie as a whole but could have been a lot better. Any viewer will find some laughs and some great music here that they will appreciate once you sort through what is irrelevant. Because of it's large musical cast however, it does serve as an historical document. I would give this a 7.5 out of 10.",

For me, it's one of the most fun movies ever made.I don't know what make movies great, but I think if I enjoy my 2 hours, it makes the cut. The Blues Brothers has a great 'repeat value', in the sense that it gets more fun to watch every single time. The soundtrack is great, the little cameos will keep you interested throughout and the shots of Chicago will make you want to be there.But above all, it is the whole attitude of the movie that makes it so special.

Elwood asking a random girl to meet him 'if her date don't work out' and her actually showing up is exactly the attitude I'm referring to.It's a longish movie and I've seen it a few hundred times. But still, on any given day, I am likely to fast forward to the bit when Jake and Elwood enter the arena for their final performance through the ladies' washroom and watch the movie down to a very exciting, exaggerated and thoroughly uplifting ending. I think IMDb's top 10 is roughly accurate, I wouldn't debate. But none of those, and I do adore each one, is a movie that make me want to 'be' the main character. This movie does.

The high angled shot of Jake Blues standing behind the yellow line and leaning over is great and when we finally see his face that adds a deft touch to our outlook of the film. His expressionless yet sophisticated notion bouncing off his brother's equally non-emotional face sets the film up for more comic demonstration.As the two drive off Jake is highly unimpressed with the new \"Blues mobile\" which encourages his brother Elwood to drive it over the uplifting bridge which in any action film this would get the blood pumping but in this case it will get the mouths moving as the two land, completely unfazed and talk about Jake's redemption and thus the story begins and the music roles.The pair must gather $5000 in a week in order to save their growing up residence, a catholic home where \"the penguin\" and Curtis place expectancy on the pair and from there, enjoyable mayhem ensues as they attempt to reform their band.This is an enjoyable feel good motive for a film that encodes religious iconography that does reasonable justice to the faith even if the eventual conclusion of the money earning plan is dealt with too quickly. The intentions of doing the right thing for the right reason are what have won this film over.Which, in a way, is quite humorous. For a story and a situation that should be serious this is frequently hilarious. From the pair abusing and robbing off pub owners to wrecking a shopping mall this has the right elements to create a feel good atmosphere and will have you chuckling away. Carrie Fisher's mysterious unnamed action woman is truly a comic treat but the brilliance of unfazed Blues Brothers gives this a finely articulate touch.What make this film so unique and special are its wonderful cameos from musical legends. Cab Calloway, Aretha Franklin, James Brown and Ray Charles are the main players and singers all wonderfully used to justify the means of their situations. From Brown's preacher to Franklin's lonely wife worker their fitting characters add an extra touch of realism and with such a wonderful music score their inclusions are arguably the strongest implementation.This has a few faults in that realism is unlikely following assassination attempts and the law restrictions for the cops wouldn't happen and the ending is perhaps too problematic and an injustice after everything but this is a cracking film, a true musical feel good appreciation of life and music",

From the first scenes of Jake being released from prison, to the final scene where the entire band is back in prison, this film never stops entertaining.\nI'd say my favorite portion is the part towards the middle when the group attempts to play a gig at Bob's Country Bunker. The band tries playing their usual set to a bunch of rowdy rednecks, and they get about a thousand beer bottles flung at them for their trouble. After finally winning the crowd over, they then skip out on their $300 bar tab. This film has cameos a plenty, car chases, great music, numerous one-liners, and a truly unique feel to it.

The movie is a tri story- A mission from god to get money for the orphanage, avoiding Jakes ex-girlfriend, and getting the band back together and keeping it together\u0085. and of course the smaller stories- avoiding the Nazis, cops, and good ole boys. Its an un-imaginable cast, a great story line and non-stop comedy.A excellent movie for all those looking for a great laugh and that love great music. This movie is a legend in its own rights and a classic. Maybe even a bit cultish.",

            "content": "In my book, there are two comedies that try to reach the level of \"epic\". The first is Steven Spielberg's 1941, the second is John Landis' The Blues Brothers.  Guess which is superior?  Landis is not a smart director (anyone familiar with Kentucky Fried Movie and American Werewolf in London can attest to that), but here his focus is more on the relationship and interaction between characters rather than typecasting.  While I am not familiar with the original Saturday Night Live skits, I can say that this is hands-down the best movie made off of the TV show.  Night at the Roxbury? Get real!Landis' camera is deeper this time around.  Much of the time he is letting events build up instead of forcing the humor.  Thus, he creates the persona of The Blues Brothers without making something along the lines of Ghostbusters.  His message is simple: \"They'll never get caught, they're on a mission from God.\"  How he conveys that almost parallels Dr. Strangelove in sheer ambition.  John Belushi surpasses his wave of mediocre roles (Animal House included) and creates the quintessential smart-ass.The comedy genre in itself is cursed because it is dependent on the viewer's intelligence and trying to appeal to a wide audience.  Landis has undoubtedly tried (Coming to America and Beverly Hills Cop III), but he is too mainstream to be taken seriously.  Thankfully, Dan Aykroyd (who is slightly more sophisticated in this sort of thing) is the one calling most of the shots with the script.  The dialog is punchy, catchy, and never gets useless.I hate musicals.  As far as I am concerned, songs in that line of work should stay on the radio and there alone.  Musicals are only trumped-up versions of the old Vaudeville performances (except nowadays we have MTV to turn us off).  While the Blues Brothers could have done without the music--it sure would've helped the running time--it does help keep it in the vein of \"blues\".  Music purists may debate that point now until they die, I don't care.The car chases in The Blues Brothers are two-sided.  On the surface, they represent the typical Hollywood pursuit.  The deeper subtext is that they parody the enormous waste Hollywood creates with such extravaganzas. Compare the final chase in all its humor and lack of seriousness with the overlong freeway chase in The Matrix Reloaded.  You can draw many similarities between the two in subtext as opposed to simple adrenaline rush.  Paging Michael Bay!  You are obsolete!Overall, a grandiose that overstays its welcome, but more than makes up for it.  This is Landis' best work, he will never improve.  Forget about everything else he made because here he finally combines what meager talents he has with a purpose.  4 out of 5 stars.",

A lots of funny situations in this movie and with a big budget, this movie easily makes it all very entertaining in one-two-three! The highlights are many; although the two biggest are the energy-bomb in the church with the black folks and the WEST SIDE STORY look when playing with Ray Charles in a music store. The movie plays on the so very right chords to make it all good, the Blues Brothers being a couple of cool guys who really get themselves into trouble, and the movie is also packed with weird characters like the wannabe-assassin woman, or the weird Nazis, and what about John Candy making pilot sunglasses even look small! THE BLUES BROTHERS is a terrific movie that keeps it up with the audience, and keeps delivering the goods in a tight and strict order. Belushi and Aykroyd are truly fabulous in their roles, wearing sunglasses and suits. And the movie always swings, there's always some kind of swingin' music rolling in the background, this making the whole mood very light and fine.It's a very good comedy, no doubt! James Brown being the Priest that makes the whole church explode into one big crazy circus and when Belushi sees the light, it all even gets more insane. Aretha Franklin playing in it too, and Ray Charles! There's dozens of known actors here, and that just adds the whole genuine part of it. The great climaxe that's truly a budget bomb with military, cops, MP's, guns, cars and everything just pushed together into a long car chase, all off course chasing the Blues Brothers. It's an absolutely highlight in the history of comedy making! STARS: 5/5",

            "content": "I always hated Hal Needham movies with those 40 minute comic car chases but they were all the rage when this movie was made and about half ofnthis movie feels like a long boring car chase.The comedy isn't that great. There is a couple of funny scenes that stuck with me but that's not saying much when the film runs two and a half hours.What makes the movie is the music and the musical guests. Ironically, only one real blues artist appears in this entire thing, John Lee Hooker and he has a brief cameo performing Boom, Boom. EVeryone else is known for their soul or jazz music. Ray Charles, Aretha Franklin, James Brown, Cab Callaway. There could have been alot more instead of Hal Needham type crashes for an hour. I like the respectable cover of Taj Mahal's She Caught Katy.The movie was massively over budget so why couldnt they have used the money better by having more full time musicians? The list of blues musicians around then is extraordinary. Muddy Waters, Albert Collins, JB Hutto, Albert King, BB King, Etta James, Hound Dog Taylor, Junior Wells, Charles Musslewhite, James Cotton, Koko Taylor, Taj Mahal, a young Robert Cray, Willie Dixon, Mighty Joe Young (last two both had separete cameos in Thief at least). They could of had Professor Longhair! TIhe king of New Orleans jazz who was a card shark when his musical career dried up(revived again thanks mostly to the success of Dr John). I imagine it would have been a bigger thrill for all involved to meet all these guys and shoot a film with them but I guess someone decided it wouldn't be as commercial as a knockoff of Cannonball Run would be. What an irritating shame.What would have worked great was a movie like Frank Zappa's Baby Snakes with alot of performances and some what appears to be spontaneous scenes (but really skits) back stage in character. It would have fleshed out the concept born from the original sketch comedy premise than what they ended up doing and the musical guests would have felt more comfortable than they appear in the movie because they wouldn't be expected to so tightly adhere to a script. They could give real reactions. Aretha Franklin looked so uncomfortable in her scene that I felt embarrassed for her.I guess they misread the market or took the lazy way out or they were rushed into production in a desperate attempt to keep the momentum of Animal House and the hit selling Blues Brothers record alive but this could have been alot better.To their credit, they did rectify the mistake of short changing genuine blues greats by having plenty of guests in Blues Brothers 2000 but no one wants to remember that one. They should have been HERE.",

Not as good a car chase as the original \"Gone in sixty seconds\" done by the late great HB Halicki, but still a worthy holder of the \"Most car wrecks in a movie\" record.Its a shame John Belushi isn't with us still today, as his comedy timing and presence would have made some of our other classic movies very different (for the even better) \"Ghostbusters\" for example :)Anyways, this movie is and always will be a 10/10 from me.",

Not to mention it's also one of the funniest movie ever. Say what you will about Animal House, Belushi is better in this. Personally I think Animal House is a little over rated. There's a secondary undescribable humor in Blues Brothers that only Chicagoans can see and nobody can explain. Small jokes through out the movie add to this inside joke. Dan Akroyd hasn't been the same since this movie came out. He has yet to find a roll to erase our memory of Elwood. Great performances are abound in tiny parts from other actors, Frank Oz, Charles Napier, Cab Calloway, Kathleen Freeman, John Candy (Orange whip? Orange whip? Three orange whips.), Henry Gibson and Ray Charles. Killer jammin soundtrack. Let's not forget this is a musical (the best and funniest ever). And then there's the car chases and car crashes. This is the only movie that can ever claim a car chase scene inside of a mall! Record number of cars were destroyed in filming this. And most of them were cop cars, BONUS! There's also the flying Nazi Car, it's a riot. And car 55 \"We're in a truck\" Plus ther'e at least two dozen memorable quotes, lines, and sets of dialogue.

It mixes all the possible elements that can be used in the perfect comedies: 1.- Good jokes: not too silly, but simple enough to not thinking much about their meaning. 2.- Very good actors and remarkable invited stars: Two words: John Belushi. He's the film. I'm not underrating Dan Aykroyd, but without John, this film would have been a disaster. And of course let's include the very famous invited stars: Ray Charles, Cab Calloway, James Brown, Carri Fisher, etc. 3.- The songs: This element isn't necessary in all comedy films, but it helps.

In the process they run into Ray Charles as a pawn shop owner who does a song, James Brown as a preacher in an hysterical church scene, and Aretha Franklin as the owner of a greasy spoon who also does a song.Not to mention running into nutty Nazis, the entire Cook County sheriff's department, and tiny Carrie Fisher who fires everything from an assault rifle to a bazooka at hapless Belushi.Forget the French Connection for a car chase. The Blues Brothers has one of the greatest car chases ever filmed as the state troopers chase Jake and Elwood through a shopping mall.I can't forget to mention the famous scene in the country/western bar which is part of comedy screen legend.Look for Steven Spielberg, John Landis, John Candy, Twiggy, Frank Oz, Paul Reubens, John Lee Hooker, Joe Walsh, and Steve Lawrence in cameos.This film is a comedy classic with soul music and the unforgettable Jake and Elwood, two of the greatest comedic characters ever created.",

Sure they have good acting, music and so on, but, well, they're just horrible. Fine, The Blues Brothers isn't exactly in touch with reality, but it understands that it is not trying to be serious, or making some statement that only 1% of the viewers will grasp. It's about car chases; it's about the Blues, man. Almost every scene in this is memorable for whatever reason, and it should be appreciated much more than it seems to be on these boards.

The movie picks up with Jake being released from prison after a 3yr stint and being reunited with Elwood. On the trip home they drop in to see their old Catholic nun who looked after them at the orphanage. She tells them of the pending closure of the home unless they can come up with 5 large. The brothers take this as if they have been given a mission by God to reform the band, do some gigs and come up with $5000. Over the next hour they seek out the old band members, some keener than other to reform. During the hunt we are treated to some great cameos from some other the legends of soul, including Aretha Franklin, John Lee Hooker and most notable Ray Charles with his brilliant performance of \"Shake A Tailfeather\". They then manage to book a big theatre for a huge show they hope will raise the money. Will it work? See it to find out.More a movie of some great scenes and cameos, but pretty patchy in spots. Belushi and Akroyd were pretty unaccomplished actors going into this and the movie heavily relies on gimmicks eg car chases than their acting prowess. Decent and holds up OK for a nearly 30yr movie.",

It does not have a plot, credible characters or believable situations.  And the wonderful thing is, it doesn't pretend it has.  That is where it's magic lies.Joliet Jake (the late John Belushi) is released from Chicago prison to meet his brother Elwood (Dan Ackroyd).  Returning to the neighbourhood where they grew up, the pair are horrified to learn the church-run orphanage that took them in as children is to be closed down.  Jake and Elwood then find themselves on a \"mission from God\" to reform their band \"The Blues Brothers\" to raise the money to save the orphanage.  Problem is, they keep making enemies everywhere they go.That is about as much story as there is in the entire film.  The rest of the movie's running time consists of slapstick comedy scenes, hilariously improbable car chases, and well-staged musical numbers featuring musical stars from the sixties and seventies (among them Ray Charles, Cab Calloway and Aretha Franklin).  Belushi and Ackroyd are two highly amusing leads.  With their suits, hats and shades and a barrage of well-placed one-liners, they make a lively pair of lovable rogues.  They're well supported by an array of  cameos including John Candy as the head cop on their case, Kathleen Freeman as \"the penguin\", Henry Gibson as a luckless neo-Nazi and Carrie Fisher, playing Jake's psychotic ex-girlfriend who ends up dropped in the mud.  There are many others.The musical numbers are guaranteed to have you up out of your chair dancing. Be it James Brown's divine \"Landmark\", \"The Theme From Rawhide\" or the concluding \"Jailhouse Rock\", there's something here for everyone.Relentless, unpretentious knockabout fun, there simply isn't another movie quite like this.",

It really is \"A Collector's Edition.\"  I'm actually going to keep this one instead of returning it!Joliet Jake really is on \"A Mission From God.\"  The way that he gets the band together and sets out for their first gig with no gig scheduled is just like the way Christ would say to the Apostles, \"Follow me,\" with no worries about what to bring along for the trip.  Jesus even let a thief act as his Treasurer.Jesus cursed a fig tree for not being ready for Him.  Jake and Elwood encounter a gas station that has no gas for them, and ironically the gas station explodes behind them when they finally get on their way.As for Jailhouse Rock at the end, I think that has always been an inside joke that Elvis is really still alive!  The reason why all the prisoners are dancing in the aisles is that they've finally seen the light and are having the type of epiphany Jake had when he did front hand springs up the aisle in the church.I must have watched The Blues Brothers on VHS 30 times or more over the years, and I'd always thought I knew who Carrie Fisher's \"Mystery Woman\" was based on.  It wasn't until tonight that I realized that she was planning to kill Elwood the whole time, as well.The new DVD is a gem.  I think that if they used cutting edge computer technology to throw in some Matrix style special effects with all the dancing, police cars flying, The Penguin sliding back inside her office, and John Belushi doing front hand springs up the aisle of the church, it would break all existing Box Office records!And speaking of \"records,\" throw in a little more music and suddenly everyone realizes that it always has been a musical!The use of the Peter Gunn theme has always been cool, and if I could request a song for the new theatrical release, I'd like to request that Henry Mancini theme from the original Pink Panther when David Niven and Robert Wagner are skiing.  I always thought that theme was a cool one, too.I'd like to see The Blues Brothers in one of those new totally digital theaters.  In that way, the timing could be controlled to allow for the audience laughter and applause.  The brightness could be adjusted so that everyone in the audience wears Blues Brothers 3-D sunglasses.They could even put in a young Paul Schaeffer with today's technology, as if he'd always been in the film all along!Could a a digitally remastered movie from 1980 win an Academy Award in 2002?

            "content": "Although this movie is not very funny in terms of goofy hilarity or wicked puns or punchlines, it makes up for it with excellent music. The Blues Brothers, originally just a comedy act on the original \"Saturday Night Live\", had evolved into a genuine musical act that focused on performing soul standards and rhythm and blues. This movie showcases not only The Blues Brothers' talents, but those of a veritable \"who's who\" of soul, R&B, and jazz music. Cab Calloway, Aretha Franklin, John Lee Hooker, Ray Charles, and James Brown make the most of their cameo appearances, and entertain us with some of their classic hits. This is one of the best musical movies I've seen, because it features such a wonderful variety of American pop music. The background music is also excellent, and includes standards from Sam and Dave, Fats Domino, and Wilson Pickett.The music greatly helps in evoking the setting of the film, which is Chicago. Visual effects and sets are also a great help. The movie presents the Windy City in all of its gritty glory, from the grimy streets below the massive el-train trestles to the opening shot showing the billowing smoke from factories and flames shooting out of the chimneys of oil refineries. We also are shown images of plump Vienna sausage grilling on the stove in a soul food restaurant and the hustle and bustle of the city center. Clearly, the cinematographers did an excellent job in presenting their vision of a city that is one of the centers of R&B music.As for the massive car chases, they are indeed eye-popping and entertaining. The movie snowballs into hyperbole in the chase scenes that it almost seems credible. The special effects and vast array of extras to serve as national guard soldiers and policemen ensure that this movie certainly earns a reputation as a comedy epic, akin to \"It's a Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World.\" As for the acting, John Belushi and Dan Aykroyd hold their own as Jake and Elwood Blues, respectively. They're not laugh-out-loud funny most of the time, but they do their best to at least be consistently amusing and entertaining as the they're trying to reform their band, or are avoiding capture from an assortment of enemies. To their credit, they hold this movie solidly.John Landis did an excellent job at creating a movie that is both epic comedy and soul music musical. While the film ended up in the red when it premiered, time has been kind to this classic, and it will no doubt introduce a future generation to classic soul music.",

And it's not as if that excess isn't funny in this context - the juxtaposition of the rather abstract Blues brothers, sometimes conniving and self-serving (albeit justified by their supposed mission from God) but more often hermetically sealed in their own weird outlook and set of rules, largely oblivious to the vast property destruction and chaos following in their wake, is fundamentally a pretty good joke; and Landis'\t ceaseless commitment to pushing it further and further carries it right until the end (although he seems to undercut the very last joke through bad editing). The quirkily specific evocation of Chicago is an effective counterpoint; as is the very sincere and guileless enthusiasm for the music: the movie's ambition to act as a showcase for a classic line-up of soul/r&b performers  is a great asset in time capsule terms. It's more interesting (or at least innocuous) than funny, with relatively few laughs. But there's a lot of genuine engaging oddity - the extremely long walk through the prison yard in the opening sequence; the one-off stylistic parodies in such scenes as the confrontation with Freeman; the cover of Rawhide; the strange tenderness as they go to sleep in the dingy apartment near the train tracks.",

The problem with this movie is that some parts are confusing, like the Minnie The Moocher scene. How did they change into the performance so quickly, and how did they change back? Another thing is the fact that they never met the goal established in the beginning. They never payed the taxes, so they failed at helping the orphanage. Over all, I think the movie is a very fine piece of cinema. 8/10",

Jake and Elwood Blues are a pair of performers, albeit fictional, that know what it takes to put on a good show. The music in the film is one of the best things about the movie, coming as it does from quite a few real musicians. The Blues Brothers hold the record for the number of cars destroyed in a chase scene, and the final chase scene is a sight to behold. The star-studded cast is excellent and the movie is just a showpiece for all of these stars. This is by far the best film ever made from a Saturday Night Live sketch, and one of the best movies to feature Dan Ackroyd. Bottom Line: Forget the horrible Blues Brothers 2000, this movie is the real McCoy. It occupies a valued space in my collection.",

And even Ray Charles! The musicians were world class - all of them.I challenge you to find a 1980 movie with such a cast, not even counting the \"bad guys\"/police.Favorite scenes abound, and the cast was simply top notch.

I've never done that. It has since become my all time favourite film, but it didn't start out that way. After seeing it for the first time, my reaction was: \"Well, it's not bad... I can see why it's a cult movie... all that singing would be good in a cinema, but it's not great.\" Somehow I decided to watch it once more before taping over it, and this time I really started to like it. Over the end credits I actually got up and started dancing (I have no life, I know), and I knew there was something happening cause I'd never done that before. I think that it actually does get better on a second viewing, just because the beginning is so slow going (all that silence), you expect the rest of the movie to be like that, which of course it's not. **What I'm saying is.. watch this movie twice!!** I love this movie, mainly because I feel indebted to it for helping to get me listening to blues and also old rock and roll. Before I saw this I just put up with whatever teeniebopper crap was on the radio, but then I bought the soundtrack, then heaps of other Blues Bros stuff, then I dug out my families old record colection (that hadn't been played for 10 years) and now I hardly listen to the new stuff. For this I am grateful. It also got me watching cult movies, before I saw this I never saw myself watching things like Plan 9 From outer Space. In short, this one movie changed my life, my tastes in music, movies and fashion. It taught me what makes a good comedy, it inspired me to track down old SNL tapes, and I was introduced to John Belushi, and the talent of Dan Aykroyd (who I'd never liked much till I saw this). By the way, why does everyone praise this as Belushi's film and brainchild, when it was Aykroyd who suggested the band, who introduced Belushi to the blues, who wrote the screenplay? Oh well. Whoever you are, go and see this film. Now. If you've already seen it, then see it again. Good. Now wait three days and watch it again. Buy the soundtrack. Or better yet, buy the Blues Brothers complete (all three albums rolled into one). Now go to a late night screening of it. Very good. See, that wasn't so hard was it? And once you've seen the best film ever made (this one, dummy), go and read the best book ever written: Catch 22. You'll never be the same again, I promise.",

            "content": "I saw this film for the first time in 1994 in a small town where I happened to study for a year, in the local movie theater for a ridiculously low sum of money. A school class had organized a screening of the film to help finance a class trip or something. The print was in rather bad shape, and the audience a bit too loud, but I had a great time. This film became my favorite along with \"Hatari!\" and \"Father of the Bride\" (the Steve Martin remake). Everything in this film is just right:The attitude: Jake and Elwood manage to keep their coolness no matter what obstacles come their way. With cops in hot pursuit, they totally demolish a shopping center, while calmly discussing everything that's sold there (check out the worker who accidentally bumps into the camera while trying to run to safety). A mysterious woman (Carrie Fisher!) destroys a seedy hotel where Elwood lives, but that doesn't seem to bother the brothers, who climb out of the pile of debris, wipe the dirt off their suits and carry on walking.The music: James Brown's enthusiastic Soul Preacher engaging a whole churchgoing audience (including Belushi and Aykroyd) into a wild gospel number where everyone starts singing and swinging on the floor (some even jumping high up close to the roof, defying the laws of gravity). Aretha Franklin shows she has a way with words and tells Matt Murphy to \"Think about what you're trying to do to me\". Ray Charles displays his talents by \"Shaking the Tailfeather\" in a music shop, with the whole street joining in the fun. The funniest scene in the country bar, where the audience, irritated by \"Gimme Some Lovin'\", has to be calmed down by renditions of \"Rawhide\" and the sure-fire tearjerker \"Stand by Your Man\". Not to forget Cab Calloway's \"Minnie the Moocher\" and the titular band's takes on \"Everybody Needs Somebody\" and \"Sweet Home Chicago\".The humor: Just see the Quotes section for this one, there are plenty of memorable lines in this movie.The faces: Landis puts in his usual assortment of film directors and other familiar faces in cameo roles: Frank Oz as a prison officer at the beginning, Steven Spielberg young and unrecognizable to those who know only his bearded mug shots of today, and Landis himself as a policeman joining his colleagues in the shopping center chase scene. Paul \"Pee-Wee Herman\" Reubens as the waiter who takes the brothers' dinner orders in the restaurant, and Twiggy as a girl whom Elwood asks for a date. And don't blink or you'll miss long-haired and mustachioed rock singer and brief The Eagles member Joe Walsh during the closing \"Jailhouse Rock\" number.Stock up on dry white bread and whole fried chickens, invite your friends to join in, and have a good time together with a movie filled with SOUL!",

            "content": "Here is a movie that has a miasma of music, comedy, and car crashes. It is almost obscene how many times I have seen this film -- while the amount of times I have seen Star Wars is obscene. The Blues Brothers went way over budget with its vast destructiveness and cool cameos. Its exuberance is what helped this movie become a pop-cult classic and it would be John Belushi's last box-office hit. It is one of the first movies based on a Saturday Night Live and still, along with Wayne's World, one of the best.The Blues Brothers are Elwood and Jake Blues, two brothers who just reunited after Jake's incarnation in Juliet. They visit an old orphanage of theirs that is in desperate need of money. The orphanage needs 5,000 dollars or it will be forced to close. Now Elwood and Jake can collect the money through dirty deeds, however they have an epiphany instead. During a James Brown sermon, a beam of light begets an idea -- the band. They need to hunt down their former band members and put the band back together. It has to work; they are on a mission from God.This film has two spectacular and unbelievable car-chase scenes. They rank with Bullitt, The French Connection, and To Live and Die in L.A. as among the best filmed automotive-chase sequences. The first pursuit involves the Blues Brothers avoiding the 'rollers' by driving in a mall. The amount of destruction by the brothers, while spouting irreverent quips and the pursuant police is overwhelming, but fun to watch. They crash through stores, run over merchandise stands, avoid the mall-walkers, and create utter chaos. The second memorable chase involves the destruction of many cars. It is a long awesome sequence, that I will not spoil here, that was very costly and went over the expected budget for this film.At the very heart of this comedy is the music. This film is essentially a blues musical. There are performances from James Brown, Aretha Franklin, John Lee Hooker, Cab Calloway, Ray Charles, and many more. These entertainers also act in this film with varying degrees of success. Belushi and Ackroyd also perform several blues and country songs in this film. As amateurs, they are good. Belushi has a raspy singing voice, while Ackroyd has a baritone/bass quality to his voice. However, they still cannot compare to Charles proving the vitality of a piano or James Brown serving a sermon.This is also a very funny film. Belushi had tremendous talents as a comedic actor and Ackroyd works very well here. One of the funniest scenes involves them trying to persuade their former horn player, who now works at a French restaurant, to come back to the band. Their antics amongst themselves horrify the bourgeois patrons as they guzzle food down, throw it at each other, and ask people if they are willing to sell their women. Also, look for a quick cameo in this scene by Paul Reubens (Pee Wee Herman).Comedy is very subjective. However, it is hard to find too many people that do not like this film. It was even on a few critics top ten lists for 1980, i.e. Gene Siskel and Belushi's second box office hit (Animal House was his first). This film offers so much: music, comedy, and action. It is one of my favorite comedies and I have seen it at least twenty-five times. The 'R' rating is a bit misleading. It is there for the colorful and metaphorical language. If you have any inkling for blues and comedy then watch this film. If not, watch it anyway.",

Jake and Elwood decide that getting the band back together would be the best way to get the $5000. They go finding the original members of the band and convince them to rejoin the band. After they get all the members back they start playing. After playing at \"Bobs Country Bunker\" they go and play at the \"Palace Hotel\". Along the way they end up making numerous enemies (the police, the \"Good 'ol Boys\", the American Nazi party, and Jake's ex girlfriend. This results in numerous hilarious car chases.

It was a magic combination of two actors, Belushi and Aykroyd, hitting their creative peaks at a time when they could get away with just about anything due to their rising star power. The spirit of this film can never be recreated (see Blues Brothers 2000 for proof).This was the first film to destroy a mall in a high speed pursuit. And never again will a film run a 100 car chase scene through downtown Chicago, the underground Lower Wacker Drive, and under the El tracks.The music is heavily featured and joyfully celebrates blues, gospel, and classic R & B.And, the \"cool\" factor runs high, with Jake & Elwood wearing their trademark black suits, hats, and Ray Bans for (virtually) the entire film, while spouting classic lines like \"It's 106 miles to Chicago, we've got a full tank of gas, half a pack of cigarettes, it's dark, and we're wearing sunglasses.\" Writer Aykroyd's love for the music and mayhem are apparent and this film, even after 25 years, still stands up as well as it did in 1980.",

Full credit to Director/Writer John Landis on this piece of work (possibly the best he has ever done) as he has not only inter-weaved a good storyline into a gutsy blues/rock musical, but he has also added intense drama and action into what is one of the funniest films of its time.Jake Blues (John Belushi) has just been released from prison. He is greeted outside the prison gates by his brother Elwood Blues (Dan Ackroyd) In an effort to stay on the right side of the lord, Elwood holds Jake to a promise that he made to the Catholic Nun that brought them up many years ago when they were living in the Catholic Parish as adopted children. When visiting the nun the boys realise the church parish will be shut down unless they are able to pay taxes worth $5000. This is their Mission from God, a quote which has been made famous by the 2.My favourite character in this film was that of Jakes Mysterious Woman Friend (Carrie Fisher) This was a dark part, which was never really explained until right at the very end when we see that Jake may have a soft side... more to the point he is just trying to escape from her, as well as the Nazi's and Police that will provide both Jake and Elwood with sum what of a headache making it to the county assessors office in time to pay the money and rescue the church.I personally was really impressed with the Art department in this film.... Every set was perfectly decorated. Possibly Harry Larrecq 's best work too (Also did Art Direction for The Munsters-1964, Manhunter-1972 and The Thing-1982) One aspect that can't be beaten is the soundtrack. Possibly one of the most instantly recognised themes of all times- The Peter Gunn Theme. When fortunate enough to work with a cast and crew of songwriters such as Cab Calloway, Aretha Franklin, Elmer Bernstein, Ray Charles and James Brown- with Stephen M Katz as Choreographer, there is absolutely no surprise that the music and dance in this film is nothing short of exceptional.",

Probably the most fun for me is the constant deadpan dialog delivery and mannerisms from Belushi and Ackroyd - I don't think they ever crack even a small grin. Of course, neither does anyone else, except for the late, great John Candy. And so many fun small parts played by surprise actors: Twiggy, Henry Gibson, Cha-Cha-Cha-Chaka Khan, Kathleen Freeman (with her Avenging Ruler) and John Lee Hooker!

The film's soulful, powerful, amazing and energetic musical numbers equally compliment its bold, crazy SNL-inspired comedic strokes. Has any movie ever reached the heights of pure lunacy and divine, get-up-and-dance musical performances like this one? I love this movie like possibly no other. It reaffirms a joy in the shared experience of music, it captures that crazy 70's comedic aesthetic, and it's a hell of a lot of fun. Period.Crafted on the wispiest of premises, \"THE BLUES BROTHERS\" is a journey that begins as a mere traffic infraction and ends as a tribute to the (at the time) forgotten musical inspirations of James Brown, Cab Calloway, Aretha Franklin, John Lee Hooker and even Sam and Dave - scored to the destruction of downtown Chicago. This movie truly is a revelation. Why? It loves and breathes the music of the Windy City blues and Memphis soul, and wears its influences, tributes and loves on its rather cigarette-burned and motor oil-stained sleeves. Written by SNL's Dan Aykroyd and director John Landis, the film follows the Blues Brothers John Belushi and Aykroyd through a magical quest to save the orphanage that the two grew up in - by paying up the $5000 back taxes on the place. The film breezes thru it's 133 minutes (longer if you enjoy the new \"Pickwick Preview\" DVD Special Edition) with such sweet, happy insanity as it follows Aykroyd & Belushi as they try to reassemble their old, misplaced band (featuring kings of the 60's Stax movement, Steve Cropper & Donald 'Duck' Dunn, as well as studio primos Tom Malone, Lou Marini, Alan Rubin and Murphy (The Big Bus) Dunne) to play a special benefit concert.Landis's penchant for anti-establishment \"Animal House\" style laughs are here in full force. The film's anarchic DNA finds an amazing 20+ minute car chase through the streets and boroughs of Chicago coupled with a crazy, smart thumbed-nose screenplay. It has as much fun with the straight outside city limits regulars who frequent country-hick bars as with the blues-drenched 78rpm vinyl fantasyland that is fuelled by never-say-die spirit and determination where the underdogs hold all the cards and sing a pretty great song or two.Stocked full of cameos including Henry \"Laugh In\" Gibson, Carrie Fisher, John Candy and even director Steven Spielberg (!) it's the music and goodwill of the endeavour that completely reminds us of the healing power of music, the energy of free-spiritedness, and the beauty of off-the-wall, collision-course comedy. 1980's \"THE BLUES BROTHERS\" is an absolutely perfect film.

But, as a child of the 50s, I'm a big fan of the music that fills this movie.And how it fills it! Dan Aykroyd's script specifies nearly continuous music: either it's coming out of the 8 track tape in the Bluesmobile, or it's being sung by a who's who of blues-rock.A loose plot is quickly thrown together: the boys need to raise some money to save the orphanage where they grew up.To do this, Jake and Elwood go on an unusual two part road trip. The first has them rounding up the scattered members of the band and the last part is a frantic chase back to Chicago to pay the tax money. (Watch for Steven Spielberg as the tax agent)Both parts are enjoyable in their own way: the first half has them encountering John Lee Hooker, Aretha Franklin and Ray Charles. And the chase scene effectively parodies movies made many years after this one. A neat trick, indeed.But through it all, the music. This makes the DVD one of those (like \"Woodstock\" or \"HAIR\") that I might put on just to listen to while I work at the computer.Oh yeah, the DVD version has a few extra minutes running time over the version that had the widest release. Nine stars, just for the music. The fact that the movie itself is a whole lot of fun is just gravy. One of my faves.",

After a visit with the Penguin (Kathleen Freeman) and Curtis (Cab Calloway), and a vision in church on Jake's behalf, they decide to get the band back together in an attempt to save the orphanage.  Can they do it? It's going to be a difficult task for the Blues Brothers, considering that most of the band members have moved on with their lives.  Furthermore, shortly after Jake's release from prison, both Blues Brothers find themselves on the wrong side of the law.  Along the way, they attract the entire Chicago Police force, Illinois Nazis, the Good Ole Boys, and Jake's estranged fiancee (Carrie Fisher) as nemeses.  If you've ever experienced a wild car ride through through the streets of Chicago, or even if you haven't, see this movie.  You'll know what it's like.  Besides the double sided plot of saving the orphanage as well as their behinds, the Blues Brothers play alongside a quite impressive cast of characters.  It's almost a pop culture \"Chronicle of the 20th Century\" in this movie!  Besides the Brothers, the Hi-De-Ho Man, and Princess Leia, there's an all-star cast of musicians including James Brown, Ray Charles, John Lee Hooker, Aretha Franklin, Steve Cropper and Donald Duck Dunn, backup musicians for Sam & Dave, and in non-singing roles, Steve Lawrence and Joe Walsh.  Then there's Frank Oz (\"The Muppet Show\"), John Candy (SNL), Henry Gibson (\"Laugh-In\"), Twiggy, Rosie Shuster (Frank's daughter and Lorne Michaels' ex), Pee-Wee Herman (Pee-Wee Herman!), and if that's not all, Stephen Spielberg plays a cameo role.

Don't miss a minute of this classic. as they destroy at least 30 1974 Dodges, and don't forget Henry Gibson's Nazimobile.

            "content": "Some authors, the saying goes, only have one book in them.  To extend the metaphor, some people in the movie business have only one film in them.  The Blues Brothers was that film for not one, but three different people - John Belushi, Dan Aykroyd, and John Landis.  Okay, together Landis and Belushi made something out of Animal House, but despite amassing a huge body of work, the three have mostly disappointed.  But not with this film.The story boils down to the need of the eponymous brothers, Jake and Elwood, to reassemble their now-defunct band in order to provide money to help the orphanage of their youth pay back taxes.  The movie dances wonderfully on the border between fantasy and reality, with the brothers encountering Illinois Nazis, flamethrower-wielding ex-girlfriends, and everything else you might expect Chicago to throw at you.  It stands tall in the ugly line-up of SNL film translations; why is it so hard nowadays to find the kind of creativity and straightforward talent that went into this film?The Blues Brothers is also interesting in the way is constructs ideas of race, mainly using music as a medium.  The blues as a musical style was the contribution of African-Americans; now we have two very white guys (Aretha Franklin mistakes them for \"Hassidic diamond merchants\") attempting to assume the mantle.  This naturally leads to some uneasiness; strolling the south side of Chicago, the brothers look about as uncomfortable as U2 did when they made a similar excursion through Memphis in Rattle and Hum. Adoptive big brother Curtis (Cab Calloway) sends the brothers to the church of Reverend Cleophus (James Brown), who kicks out a number understandably more soulful than anything else in the film, providing Jake with a religious experience in the process.  As light from heaven shines through the window, the music is drowned out by a vague European chorus: the cue to the audience that we're dealing with the \"real\" God now.  Isn't Brown's gospel tune religious enough for God?  Despite these moments of discord, The Blues Brothers pays its dues to the music by including its most important figures whenever possible.  Franklin, Brown, and Calloway, as well as Ray Charles all put in great performances, providing icing on a very delicious cake.",

But their activities lead to more and more enemies pursuing them. It mixes up a number of different comic genre: Jake and Elwood behaving badly (in front of a nun and at a posh restaurant); the music numbers performed by them and iconic blues singers including Aretha Franklin and Ray Charles; and the spectacular car chase that sees them being followed by the Chicago police, a country-and-western band and a neo Nazi party.Armed with a number of unlikely concepts, the movie has enjoyable feel-good moments and perfectly staged dance routines and car chases. The cast also has some terrific cameo turns including a hot-head Carrie Fisher, a sinister Henry Gibson (as a Nazi leader), and some great supporting turns from Cab Calloway and the band themselves. But the real highlight is John Belushi, whose comic performance pulls the whole thing together, whilst Dan Aykroyd gives a great support as his deadpan taller brother.

The mall chase scene is probably one of my favourite pieces of motion picture ever. The humour associated with Carrie Fisher's assaults is also to die for - \"Who IS that girl?\", \"It's nine o'clock - we gotta go to work\" and \"There must be at least seven dollars worth of change here\" are some of the best lines in the film.

After Jake makes parole (Elwood is already out), the two head to their former orphanage for a visit only to find out its in danger of being shut down with only eleven days to get the money. Not wanting to lose the only home they've known and after getting a inspiration from visiting a local church. The two set out to reunite their old band and raise the money. But a simple red light running gets the cops right back on their tail. Pretty soon modern day Nazi, an angry country band, the mod and the whole police force of Chicago is gunning for them. Oh, did I mention a former fianc\u00e9e is trying to kill Jake for running out on her at their wedding.Like I said, the movie is just a full out musical trip with such a hilarious story to boot. Nothing is taken seriously here from the inspiration at the church to coming together of the band. The road trip to the concert and the concert itself to the final climax that is one of the best car chases in film history. All thanks to the various talent that made the movie such a joy to watch (some of which are no longer with us, R.I.P).Their were a few flaws, the running gag where of Jake's fianc\u00e9e countless attempts to kill him and his brother go a little thin and you have to a have a suspension of belief to watch it, especially during the final moments.

We don't get a comedy, mostly it's a collection of bad jokes and toilet humour but in 1980, the first SNL movie blasted our way and true comedy lovers haven't recovered since. In the time when National Lampoon had made the classic comedy 'Animal House', SNL decided to break into the game with the popular skit 'The Blues Brothers'. Although it wasn't a regular sketch, it would make great film material. The Blues Brothers are Jake (John Belushi) and Elwood (Dan Aykroyd) Blues. Two musicians who are seperated when Jake is put in jail. The day he comes out, which is where our movie starts, Elwood insists on taking him to see \"The Penguin\" (Kathleen Freeman), the nun that raised them. When she informs them that the orphanage they grew up in will be shut down if they don't get money, The Blues Brothers decided to round up their old band and perform the gig to end all gigs and save the orphanage. What follows is a comedy of epic proportions. It's possibly the only epic comedy and it is sure to please many groups of people. Music lovers will love, car chase lovers will love it (Watch out for that mall!) and true 80's comedy lovers will love it. I find that 'Blues Brothers' truly improves with age. There are few boring moments and if there is, the script by Dan Aykroyd and John Landis follows it up with comedic moments of sheer genuis. The truth is that they don't make 'em like this any more. The performances are spot on. Belushi proves what a talented actor he is and it's a shame he had to die when he did because he could have done really great stuff. Aykroyd has stayed with is and, although some of his more recent movies are less than impressive, he's still one of the funniest guys out there and I'd like to see him do a Blues Brothers 3 (Unlike most people, I enjoyed the second one). John Landis has always been a talented director and it's certainly on display here. Very nicely staged, shot and edited, the production crew are certainly to thank as well. The supporting cast is the stuff of dreams with the band making a big impression and very funny cameos by John Candy, Carrie Fisher, Henry Gibson, Twiggy, Paul Reubens, Steven Spielberg, Cab Calloway and Aretha Franklin. One last thing to note is that this film was originally going to run 3 hours and even have intermissions but all that stuff is sadly lost with the twenty minutes that remain have been crafted into the director's cut available on DVD. I could really go on about this movie. On the personal side, it's a family favorite and the whole family watches it about once a year while I use every chance I get to watch it. It's smart, crazy, loud and funny proving that a really good movie can come out of SNL. Congratulations to anyone that worked on this film because you have went down in comic history.",

            "content": "Their on a mission from God. That's all you have to know. This is one of the funniest films I have seen. First of all a little background I'm from Chicago and I love the way the Blues Brothers talk, what they say, etc. so I connected with the film on a comedic subconscious level.There really isn't much to say it's just a great movie. Dan Aykroyd and John belushi have great chemistry and deliver great performances. They also have some really good dance moves and are pretty good at singing the blues. I like all the gags that happen throughout the movie, such as; Carrie Fisher constantly trying to kill the Blues Brothers, Elwood always saying that they're on a mission from God, and that the Blues Brothers keep making enemies (the Nazis, police, Carrie Fisher and the good ole boys) and that gag pays off with one of the best car chases I've ever seen (which I'll get to later). Honestly I could make a whole review about the third act in Blues Brothers. There's also just little things like; whenever the Blues Brothers get attacked afterwards they just walk it off and brush their suits off. I like how they stick out like a sore thumb with their suits they're constantly wearing. The songs they sing are good and they put their own spin on it. This movie also doesn't spit out exposition. Like Dan doesn't say to John: Remember the band and how we played music and stuff BLAH BLAH BLAH. That never happens which I'm thankful for. They never say they were raised in an orphanage you, the audience, figure it out yourselves. This is called show don't tell.This segment I'll call THE FINAL ACT/ CHASE SCENE OF BLUES BROTHERS IS FRICKING AWESOME\nSo as I mentioned earlier throughout the entire movie the Blues Brothers keep making enemies. So at near the end of the film all their enemies find them at the same time; the cops, good ole boys, Carrie Fisher and the Nazis are there and the brothers realize this and this all ends in an epic chase scene. So the brothers hop into the bluesmobile and there's like ten cop cars behind them as well as the good ole boys and the Nazis. The Blues Brothers are at top speed and the police cars are crashing and can't keep up so they get reinforcements, the good ole boys crash and eventually the Nazis catch up to the Blues Brothers. By the way i should mention that these are all practical effects apart from the Nazi car flying as high as a skyscraper and falling down and dying. When the Blues Bros get to the bank there's hundreds of police cars, there's armored police cars, fire trucks, fire fighters, police officers, security guards, there's a tank, helicopter, boats, the military show up, the military police show up, there's people with rifles, pistols, shotguns, and every first responder ever is there it's awesome, I love it. There are also many quotable lines in the last act and it ends with our heroes getting what they wanted but still ending up in jail. And isn't that Chicago in a nutshell?I highly recommend this movie. As of now it's a 7 but it may go up to an 8 on a second viewing. Great movie and I could see myself watching it many time in the future.",

Elwood (Akyroyd) cracked me up in the diner scene when he asks for dry white toast...a later conversation during the infamous chase scene into Chicago is classic:  We got half a pack of cigarettes, a full tank of gas and about 110 miles to go...well as it turned out, this movie had more than a full tank of gas throughout, with appearances by Aretha Franklin, Ray Charles, Cab Calloway, and other musical geniuses...if you're not laughing throughout this film, either your stitches are too new, or you've run out of gas, something that the Blues Brothers never do here.  It's raucous comedy, it's destruction on a massive scale, it's the Blues Brothers, so watch it!",

And it is so well placed and integrated within the movie.But even if you take away the music this is still a solid movie. The attitude of the movie is just hilarious - the way Jake and Elwood play up the \"mission from God\" element, the absurdity of some of the things that happen. You just have to laugh.This is the type of movie you can watch again and again and again. A true classic, and worthy of addition to any good movie collection.",

            "content": "What a great movie, if you like blues and really appreciate the good old days. Blues Brothers is one big tribute to the old blues, soul, and r&b school. And what a tribute! Ray Charles, Aretha Franklin, John Lee Hooker, James Brown and Cab Calloway, all agreed to contribute to the films music numbers. The Blues Brothers themselves are not that bad either. (Who knew that John Belushi had such a powerful blues voice?)The story is very simple. Jake (John Belushi) is released from jail and picked up by his brother Elwood (Dan Aykroyd). Immediately they visit the old orphanage where they were brought up. This place is in big debt and if someone doesn't come up with $5000 soon it has to be shut down. So Jake and Elwood decide to put their old blues band back together, to raise money for the orphanage. Now we follow them while they track down the members of the band, get their first gig, their second (big) gig, and are being chased by the police, military and Illinois Nazis all over Chicago in the incredible final. This sequence MUST contain the biggest destruction of police vehicles in movie history. (Still can't figure out though how they shot the \"car falling\" scene.?)As a matter of fact, Blues Brothers is also the film which contains the biggest number of mutes (actors)I have ever seen. I wonder what the budget was for actor wages!?Oh yes, the actors. Besides Aykroyd and Belushi, we have Charles Napier (lead singer of \"the good ole boys\"), Frank Oz in a small part, Steven Spielberg in one of his few parts where he doesn't play himself, Henry Gibson as the nazi leader, John Candy as the police chief, and Carrie Fisher. What can you say about her? She was at her peak here. My god, she is absolutely gorgeous!The film is filled with memorable moments. I especially love the \"Minnie the Moocher\" sequence, where Cab Calloway's suit suddenly changes from black to fancy white and the whole band also. While he is singing it (with perfection)we see Jake and Elwood (sneeking around) moving to the music. When the song is over Calloways suit is back to black. \"Hideho\", that's all I say.The movie was directed by John Landis. Now I have noticed that three of my reviews have been on Landis movies. His flicks must have a big influence on me!So, of course, I urge you to see Blues Brothers. A film with first class actors and first class music. You will definetely have two very enjoyable hours.",

Remember there were no special effects in the chase scenes except for the back flip by the Blues Mobile and the fall from the sky by the Nazi's Pinto Wagon ( remember those cars...BOOM...). If you love action and car chases you have to see the movie. Anyone who has seen Kenichi Sonoda's work on the anime movie Riding Bean or his anime and manga series Gunsmith Cats can see the references to the Blues Brothers.",

It was so tightly edited, so exciting, so ... so enticing. I really wanted to see this movie! And so I did - I'm sorry to say, with a guy I didn't particularly like, one who guffawed and made embarrassing comments regarding the return of certain items of Jake's personal property by the prison guard. Therefore I didn't quite appreciate the flick the first time out, except for the music and dancing. A few years later, when it showed up on cable, my husband and I taped it. We just about wore the tape out. I bought a copy of \"The Blues Brothers\" when it was re-released. Unfortunately the sequel (if you can call it that) was about to be released and the first 30 minutes of the tape are devoted to promoting the sequel. No matter. I can fast-forward to the good stuff.Is \"The Blues Brothers\" a great film? Of course not. It can't touch \"Casablanca\" or \"Citizen Kane\" or even some of the Marx Brothers' wackiest turns. But is it a great movie? Oh, my. Better than four fried chickens and a Coke. Better than country AND western. Better than shrimp cocktail in a five-star restaurant. (Well, maybe not that good, but close.) \"The Blues Brothers\" has become a movie (like \"A Christmas Story\") that I know so well I can quote it. Or should I say, act it. I have Aretha Franklin's, \"They still owe you money, FOOL!\" dead-on. I watch it today with a sense of melancholy. John Belushi was so talented. He had so much promise. Too bad he viewed life more as the brawling car chase than the mission from God. He could have been a contender. What a tragedy, and what a waste. No wonder the sequel didn't work. He wasn't there to toss the cigarette lighter out the car window.But we still have the original Blues Brothers romp, with its Orange Whip (every tried to drink that stuff?), dry white toast, wine served by a waiter who grew up to be Pee-Wee Herman and other visual, aural and gustatory delights.And it certainly had a heck of a trailer, too.",

I'm guessing a lot of chemical substances were ingested during the writing and filming of this movie. When they were making this mess, I'll bet they thought that this was really funny...not! If hard-pressed, I might give it two stars only for the musical numbers.Of course, this movie was about par for all of the movies that have come out of SNL cast members.

Let's just say that I was glad that I never said the wrong thing to a nun.  Dan Akroyd and John Belushi, Jake and Elwood Blues, are determined to perform music to raise money for their childhood's adoptive orphan church before it goes bankrupt. They break a `few' laws in their determination even though Jake had just been released from prison. Their determination includes putting the \"band\" back together to win some money to save the church.  The risky attitude of the two trying to avoid the authorities to accomplish their \"Mission from God\" leads from one hilarious scene to the next.  Whether it's avoiding a traffic ticket, avoiding the cops in a parking lot (making a new exit), avoiding a bar tab, reacting without emotion to a psychotic ex-fiances deadly bombed revenge or breaking into a music hall through the ladies room, these guys never flinch.  It's a movie that you can watch over and over. All the music is very good, but \"Minnie the Moocher\" and \"Sweet Home Chicago\" are the favorites.  It has a car chase that will check your alertness and make you wonder how many cars were destroyed in the making of this film.

Both ex-cons and lead singers of the Blues Brothers band, they are charged with a mission from God to find money to save the orphanage where they grew up. A flop on it's original release, this film grew to become a cult-classic, spawning a sequel, stage shows and more spin-off CDs than I care to count. Undoubtedly one of the funniest movies of the \u009180s (possibly of all time), this masterpiece never fails to amuse or entertain. Yet what makes this film great?Could it be that John Belushi's and Dan Akroyd's sunglasses-wearing characters are extremely funny, given their constant deadpan expressions and unique dancing abilities?Is it the all-star cast - with cameos from, amongst others, such blues & soul legends as Cab Calloway, James Brown and Arethra Franklin?Is it the superb music, always suitable to the moment and making the audience wish that they too could play the harmonica?Is it the collection of stereotype characters \u0096 gay neo-nazis, shotgun wielding cowboys and anal-retentive clerks who brighten up every scene?Is it the car chases, always taken to the extreme and then over the edge in all the action scenes (yes, I know most of the stunts are physically impossible \u0096 they're meant to be)?Is it because of the seemingly random encounters with celebrities and attacks from an enraged Carrie Fisher, which make the audience sit up and take notice?Or is it the fact that all of these together have produced a highly entertaining film which, even if it doesn't have you returning again and again, will at least have you searching for the soundtrack.A classic in it's own league.",

Now I'm not saying that if you liked Rocky Horror, you'll like this, because I know someone (Drew) who really didn't like The Blues Brothers at all.  Now I'm not just saying this because I'm a fan of the movie, but I really can't see how you can't find this even a little bit funny.Granted, John Belushi did some amazingly funny movies, I strongly believe that this was his best.  I don't think he ever got more into a role than he did for playing the character of Jake Blues.  He and Dan Ackroyd completely emersed themselves in this movie, and I believe it shows greatly.There are many great great scenes in this movie.  Don't worry, I will not give any away, but all of the car chases are quite hilarious.  Also, the Illinois Nazi scene is fantastic.  I'm sure most people have heard the phrase \"we're on a mission from God.\" well, that originated with this movie.  Everytime they say it in the movie is just so incredibly opportune.  Might I recommend renting or buying the special unrated version of this movie.  Don't worry, the unrated is the same as the R version, and its only for language anyway.  There are some deleted scenes in this version of it which make all the more funny.  I really, truely hope you enjoy this one.",

This level of hilarity can never be captured again.The movie begins with Jake Blues (John Belushi) getting released from prison and the corrections officer (Frank Oz) gives him back his trademark hat and sunglasses. His brother Elwood (Dan Aykroyd) picks him up in the new Bluesmobile--an old police car. They go to visit Mother Mary Stigmata (Kathleen Freeman) who owns an orphanage in downtown Chicago. She tells them that because she cannot pay the taxes, the orphanage will be closed. The Blues Brothers are heartbroken because they grew up in the orphanage. Their friend Curtis (Cab Calloway) encourages them to get the old Blues Brothers Band back together. The Blues Brothers are on a \"mission from God\" to save the orphanage. Jake and Elwood scour the state of Illinois to look for them all and the finally get them all back together. On the way, they are pursued by a mystery assassin woman (Carrie Fisher), the Illinois State Police (including John Candy), and the Illinois Nazis (including Henry Gibson). Despite all this, they manage to get a gig at Bob's Country Bunker (run by Jeff Morris) posing as the Good IL' Boys. After they are done playing, the real Good IL' Boys show up. Bob realizes the Blues Brothers have tricked him and he and the Good IL' Boys join the chase against the Blues Brothers. The Blues Brothers decide to hold a concert to raise money. It works and the concert is a success. Some uninvited guests are the police, the Nazis, and the Good IL' Boys. During the concert, the Blues Brothers escape from the concert hall and go through the sewers. Down there, the mystery woman meets up with them and tries to kill them again. She reveals herself as Jake's ex-bride-to-be. He left her standing at the altar. Jake confesses his wrongs and she forgives him. The Brothers remember the police and leave her down there while they escape. They lead a high-speed car chase through downtown Chicago to get the money to the County Clerk's Office. Once there, the clerk (Steven Spielberg) accepts the payment and the orphanage is saved. The Blues Brothers and the band go to jail, though.All in all, a great movie. With special musical performances by James Brown (\"This Old Landmark\"), Cab Calloway (\"Minnie the Moocher\"), Ray Charles (\"Shake a Tail Feather\"), Aretha Franklin (\"Think\"), and John Lee Hooker (\"Boom Boom\"), this film is a true classic.

Along the way, they gather up their old bandmates from their day jobs, buy their instruments (on credit, of course), play their first gig at a redneck joint behind a chicken-wired stage (\"Oh, we have both kinds: country AND western.\"), trash a shopping mall, incur the wrath of a group of Illinois Nazis (\"I hate Illinois Nazis.\"), and lead the police force of what seems the entire state of Illinois on a mad chase through Chicago and the immediate vicinity.From the opening sequence where Jake Blues is released from Joliet Federal Penitentiary to the closing car-chase, this picture will keep you in stitches.  The soundtrack kills, showcasing a who's who of blues performers from John Lee Hooker to Cab Calloway to Aretha Franklin. The Band rocks in their performance bits; and, yes, these are actual musicians, most of them top session-men of the day.  Look for cameos from such stars as Frank Oz (\"One unused prophylactic.  One soiled.\"), Steve Lawrence, and a very young Steven Spielberg. You'll be quoting lines from this picture forever.\nIf your video store has it, buy the extended version with the footage that was left out of the theatrical release.  The longer musical numbers alone make it worth the price.  And the scenes where Elwood quits his job help to explain events later in the movie.  All-in-all, this is a must-see if you like the blues.  Even if you don't, give it a chance, you'll laugh yourself into a stupor.",

Ayrkoyd said during their SNL years, \"John, you teach me about rock, and I'll teach you about the blues.\"  On screen, they're magic together.I guess one of the reasons people don't like this movie is because it seems so \"silly.\"  Car crashes with hundreds of vehicles, impossible stunts, etc. But you have to remember, seriously, this movie has a meaning, somewhere, deep down inside its subtle genius.

I think I must have watched this movie at least 3 times in the past few weeks.Granted, most SNL skit-to-movie concepts are dead on arrival (or should be), but The Blues Brothers was cut from a different cloth. Belushi and Akroyd - two members of what I consider the \"Master Class\" of SNL - are funny not because they portray Jake and Elwood as humorous characters, but rather for the way they portray the quirky Blues Brothers as unfazed by the chaos surrounding them, and oblivious to how the other characters perceive and react to them. It's the ironic humor inherent in eccentric characters who take themselves much more seriously than does the rest of the world.Much of the enjoyment of this movie comes from the wonderful musical cameo performances by the likes of Ray Charles, Aretha Franklin, Cab Calloway, etc. The Blues Brothers would have been just another (forgettable) cop-chase comedy without them. Belushi and Akroyd could never have carried this alone - especially the way they sing, although I do enjoy their bullwhip-cracking rendition of \"Rawhide\", and always chuckle at the way \"Stand by your Man\" makes the beer bottle-tossing rowdies at \"Bob's Country Bunker\" melt away to mush (and I always feel sorry for that poor guy drowning his lonliness in his beer mug!).All in all, The Blues Brothers is two hours of light-hearted, inoffensive, and (for some of us) nostalgic fun, to be enjoyed but not taken too seriously.",

Its kind of hard to describe what makes this musical comedy so awesome, but as soon as you find out that they're on a \"Mission from God\", you know you're in for a wild ride.It all begins with Jake Blues (John Belushi) being released from prison and meeting up with his brother, Elwood Blues (Dan Aykroyd). After a rousing church scene with James Brown, Jake \"sees the light\" and learns that they must put the band together to get money to save the orphanage that they grew up it. It keeps getting better from there, with guest appearances by Ray Charles and Aretha Franklin, just to name a few, and a bunch of great musical numbers by the Blues Brothers band, too. The movie has a lot of funny moments, from the part in the beginning with Frank Oz (I was laughing out loud for 5 straight minutes), to the part with the Illinois Nazis chasing the Blues Brothers (\"Ive always loved you\"...hahaha), this movie will keep you in a good mood through the entire 2 hours of blues goodness. The movie is finished up with an awesome car chase, which still has the record for the most cars wrecked in a single movie.All in all, it would be a crime to pass up on this great movie, and, with the 25th Anniversary Edition DVD coming out soon (Dan Aykroyd confirmed in an interview, see it on bluesbrotherscentral.com), no-one should miss this classic movie.",

Rest well, Mr. Belushi, and have the 8-track warmed up when we meet in the next life. We dream of a world where we can outrun the police, save our homes, and be great musicians. The Blues Brothers did exactly that. Fighting injustice and deflating the pompous? Ditto. Jamming with Ray Charles and Aretha Franklin?

Of course, their efforts to do so end up causing trouble with the law, as well as other people (such as a country and western-themed bar and the band that was supposed to play there).

The superstar cameos are like a walk through the memory lane of America's great Blues, R&B, & Soul legends. The humor big, insane, and over the top. The practical stunts & explosions are massive and continue to up the ante throughout the film, just when you thought it couldn't get any bigger- it does. They must have destroyed nearly 100 vehicles in the making of the movie, and several buildings also get obliterated- all for the sake of comedic slapstick action. It does become a bit exhausting towards the end of its 150 minute runtime, as the final chase scene becomes more, and more bombastic and large scale. Most of the situational humor is genuinely funny, although it can become a bit much at times. The big moments (where cars are crashing, buildings and getting smashed, and our protagonists continue to be unfazed by the madness around them) cause some big laughter. Aretha Franklin has the standout musical number in my opinion- although seeing James Brown, Ray Charles, John Lee Hooker was also a blast. I think they could've shaved off 20-30 minutes and the movie would be paced a little better- the big cameo numbers are pretty much done by the end of the second act and since for me- those were the high points- the third act drags on a bit. But overall it is a fun ride, and especially for lovers of music. It's also fun to see Carrie Fisher play a psychotic, bitter, & violent ex-lover to Belushi.",

John Landis goes all out with his cozy Chicago feel and reckless madness with his direction. Landis uses his dry humor with a dramatic tone that kicks into gear with insanely dangerous car chases, brutal stunts, powerful live performances, and deadpan delivery of the two charismatic leads. Landis' direction is very steady as he takes you on a joy ride around Chicago and Illinois. His close-ups are very fun, but his wide shots during the car chases and mall wrecking sequences are impressive. How Landis even managed to get all those police cars, the tank, and the army extras for that finale is beyond me.\n\nJohn Landis is clearly quite funny. His sense of humor is so silly and endearing that you cannot help but love The Blues Brothers. They were sent on a holy mission from God after all. John Landis wrote The Blues Brothers with the scatterbrained Dan Aykroyd for a feast of action, witty deadpan humor, and a love of Chicago blues. The Blues Brothers is certainly John Landis' greatest film with poignant soul songs to energetic blues tunes, The Blues Brothers has it all!\n\nDan Aykroyd and John Belushi kill it as Elwood Blues and Jake Blues. Aykroyd's manic goofball is gone and replaced by a stoic anti-hero and crazy car driver with a hilarious deadpan delivery that makes Elwood so funny. Belushi's anger and frustration as Jake is very funny, and he's amazing as he pleads for forgiveness from Carrie Fisher. Aykroyd and Belushi have this lackadaisical rapport and comedic chemistry that cannot be replicated. Deborah Nadoolman's iconic black suits for Elwood and Jake are still cool to me. \n\nI must mention the cast of celebrity cameos is astounding as John Landis gets everyone from Cab Calloway and James Brown to Aretha Franklin and Ray Charles. John Candy has a great cameo as a confident cop. John Lee Hooker's street performance is pure blues as far as I'm concerned. Twiggy and Carrie Fisher's cameo scenes are very cute. Look carefully and see if you can spot Frank Oz, Steven Spielberg, and even John Landis himself! In all, The Blues Brothers' cast is second to none.\n\nGeorge Folsey Jr.'s editing saves The Blues Brothers' massive 148 minute long run-time. He cuts away from any scene that drags, but he does let the songs just play out for your enjoyment. Stephen M. Katz' cinematography is really pretty and gritty. His tender close-up shots of Elwood and Jake as they struggle to drive around and form their band is really neat. Katz' shots during the car chases are too wild. He shoots with a Chicago breakneck style like Risky Business or Ferris Bueller's Day Off. You can clearly see The Blues Brothers' influence on these films as well as Ghostbusters, Tenacious D, Wayne's World, and Canadian Bacon among others. Elmer Berstein's score is very nice and subdued for such an absurd comedy.\n\nIn all, The Blues Brothers holds up nicely.",

Over forty years later, is it at all regrettable that a blues band fronted by two white comedians had to serve as its catalyst for crossing over into the larger cultural conversation?\n\nHindsight is always 20/20, and 1980 was the proverbial different world then. But with the possible exception of similarly stark white blues champions The Rolling Stones, one could argue that no musical or cinematic vehicle has so successfully introduced the brilliance of an underrepresented art form to such a massive crossover audience. Granted, there's not much question that bits of \"The Blues Brothers\" now feel like we're watching something being worn that's been borrowed from someone else's closet (see: the church and street market scenes). Then again, there's also little question that Dan Aykroyd and John Belushi are emotionally entrenched in these transformative tunes (they started the Blues Brothers band before the film took form, and it was loaded with African-American blues legends). Nor is it in doubt that this music comedy almost singularly kicked in the door to allow an army of descendant films to pour in.\n\nPerhaps there's an argument that one way or the other, \"The Blues Brothers\" has become even more engrossing today exactly because of these nuanced dynamics.

There's never a dull moment in this picture. Jokes, music, slapstick, chases, Nazis, cops, 80s nostalgia hits, it's just great fun. The cast is amazing. Arethra Franklin, Cab Calloway, James Brown, Frank Oz, John Candy, Carrie Fisher, Ray Charles and many more. That is reason alone to see it. I'm constantly quoting this film too. It's one of those.

            "content": "A surprisingly large number of movies have been based on Saturday Night Live sketches over the years. The Blues Brothers was one of the more critically successful of these films. The Blues Brothers begins with Jake Blue being released from prison, only to find that the orphanage where he and his brother Elwood grew will close in less than 2 weeks if the pair cannot raise $5,000 in legitimate money to pay outstanding property taxes. Their quest to rebuild their old band and raise this money by playing R&B inadvertently pits them against the police, the neo-Nazis, a rival country-western band, and a surprisingly well-armed young woman of unknown motives. Along the way, there will be lots of car chases and musical numbers.\n\nI'm not much of a music critic, but the musical numbers in The Blues Brothers were some of my favorite parts of the film. The best musical numbers implore the audience to buy a copy of the soundtrack and listen to the music independently of the film, and this film made me take a serious interest in the artists whose work is on display. Some of these artists even appear in the film, as, against resistance from the studio, the creators wisely cast notable soul musicians in many of the supporting roles. Even the two leads, John Belushi and Dan Aykroyd, who are better known as actors, had substantial musical experience. The dancing in these scenes is also nicely choreographed, with characters performing flips and leaping into the air, and often involves an impressive number of extras.\n\nThe other highlight of the film is undoubtedly the car chases. Allegedly, The Blues Brothers broke the record for the largest number of automobiles destroyed in a film shoot. The first car chase is impressive enough, with the cars crashing through a shopping mall in a scene which is both exciting and chock full of product placement (\"The new Oldsmobiles are in early this year!\"). By the finale, however, the scale of the car chases has reached ludicrous levels, with seemingly everyone in the state gunning for the brothers. \n\nAs the film's origin as a recurring sketch on SNL would suggest, The Blues Brothers is a comedy, and the film contains some genuinely amusing moments. Even the car chases are filmed in a comedic manner, with slapstick sensibilities. My favorite comedic moment, however, is the result of Jake cursing in the presence of the nun in charge of the orphanage. Kathleen Freeman, incidentally, gives the nun an air of righteous menace despite being the source of the humor in that scene, a dichotomy I quite enjoy. The jokes in the film are also, with a couple notable exceptions, free of adolescent sexual or toilet humor. The worst criticism I can levy against The Blues Brothers is that some of the antagonists are perhaps a tad underutilized - we know nothing about the country band except that they don't have a union permit - although even this is a reach. Otherwise, The Blues Brothers has a trifecta - good music, good jokes, and good action.",

The characters are all likable, and the beginning angles and dialogue were promising. Yet, as the \"story\" pressed on their simple minded motive, and repetitive chase scenes became humdrum.

It's just that, even though there's a general throughline here, there's also this episodic nature to the majority of the second act that didn't really dazzle me in any way. Jake and Elwood have to go to X place and get X person to do X, they do it, and then have to go to X place and get X person to do X as well. It's all too piecemeal for my tastes.

They are trying to raise 5,000 dollars to save their own catholic school. He and his brother Elwood (Aykroyd), start going across different restaurants and bars all in an effort to get the band together. \n\nDespite some resistance from some of the former crew, they assemble.\nIn the process, they do nothing short of enraging cops, driving through a Nazi rally and pissing off quite a few rednecks. They also have an assassin (Carrie Fischer) trying to kill them. There are quite a few musical numbers as well. They have to put it all together and give quite a performance as they manage to fill a venue of 5,000 folks. The film shows some range with a pretty respectable action chase sequence as well. \n\nBlues Brothers is an understated and original comedy. The film never tries to be over the top and aim for slapstick, or really any other bits. The film simply presents itself and has you determine if you find it funny or not. Some of the funniest parts for the film for me were the constant assassination attempts by Fischer that failed, and the Blues Brothers just keep on going as if nothing happened. The musical numbers are never expected, but they fit the film well and include various musicians from James Brown, Aretha Franklin, and Ray Charles to give the film some heart and soul. Blues Brothers is a tough film to diagnose and I respected it more for the manner at which it was presented than I did the movie itself. I can't help but wonder if I would have enjoyed this film more at the height of its popularity and when the characters were more popular on SNL. In any case Belushi is so charismatic somehow, he carries the film. \n\n-2.10.2017",

            "content": "To set the stage, it is probably worth mentioning that I have never been a regular viewer of SNL, so I was only familiar with the characters of The Blues Brothers tangentially through passing references in pop culture. I genuinely didn't know what to expect with their film, and was somewhat surprised by what I got. There are really 3 big aspects to this film that a viewer can enjoy, and 2 of them worked great. Sadly, the one aspect of The Blues Brothers that didn't click for me was probably the most important one...the comedy. I didn't find the humor all that funny. I might have chuckled once after a prat fall. But most of the silly behavior and other odd things they included, while I could see they were shooting for a laugh, didn't elicit one from me. The joy of this film is that it doesn't rely totally on those jokes that fell flat. The 2nd big aspect of the movie is that it has some superb music. They sprinkle legendary singers throughout the cast and give them the opportunity to show what truly great music is all about. These musical breaks were by far the high points of The Blues Brothers, and had me tapping my toes. What took me completely by surprise was the 3rd big element you will find throughout The Blues Brothers...the quantity, length, and complexity of the car chases. I would guess that at least half the budget must have gone to getting cars to wreck and stunt drivers, because these scenes are everywhere in the film. I'm always impressed by genuine (pre-computer graphics) stunts, and these drivers pulled off some great ones.\n\nWhile there were a couple elements of the film that I liked, I had a struggle identifying with or caring about the main characters. This film features a pair of protagonists who are the worst con men ever, they are criminals, and they seem uncaring about hurting the people around them. In other words, they're selfish jerks. Then they use the excuse of \"a mission from God\" to justify their continued selfish actions. We are presented with a motive that is supposed to appear altruistic so that we will be on their side, but I didn't see the virtue in this Catholic home that made it such a worthy cause. Of course, I have to remember this is all comedy. As a result, I'm probably putting too much thought and logic into the setup and just need to roll with it. Yet, even in a comedy, I feel like they owe me the opportunity of liking the protagonists. Complaints aside, there was enough fun stuff going on in The Blues Brothers that I enjoyed watching it. It's certainly not a film I will seek out again, but I think I can see the elements that made many people fall in love with the characters back in the 80s.",

The first thing they did, is go to a church to find some answers, and when a light went to Jake, he found out an idea, which is to bring back the band as he think is \"a mission from God.\" The Blues Brothers is one of the rare SNL movies that did well financially and critically, and it makes sense as it holds up still. John Belushi and John Aykroyd are really good and have interesting interplay with each other. The songs that they play are really memorable, which is funny that in some times they just play it at random. The writing by John Landus and Dan Aykroyd is really good, and it brings some humor to it in an over the top way, even if it's trying too hard at times to make it funny.

There's likely to be a tinge of nostalgia or reminiscence, making it difficult to judge it objectively. That said, sometimes the film is just so much fun and so enjoyable that you know why you hold it in such high regard in the first place. Without a shadow of a doubt, The Blues Brothers is (still) that kind of film.\n\nWhen \"Joliet\" Jake Blues (John Belushi) is released from prison, he and his brother Elwood (Dan Aykroyd) pay a visit to the old Catholic home where they grew up. They soon find out that the orphanage is to be shut down due to lack of funds. As a result, Jake and Elwood go on a mission to re-form their old blues band and raise the money required.\n\nSay what you will about the comedic talents of Will Ferrell, Adam Sandler or Mike Myers but they share something in common in terms of making their name on comedy sketch show Saturday Night Live. These names are just three of the shows recent successful comedians but having, personally, been born in the late 70's and grew up throughout the 80's, most of the comedies I was exposed to were filled with the familiar faces that actually had a hand in the origins of this show - Chevy Chase, Bill Murray, Steve Martin, Eddie Murphy and, of course, John Belushi and Dan Aykroyd. In fact, The Blues Brothers is an adaptation of a short sketch that first aired on Saturday Night Live and is one of only two successful film adaptations from the show - the other being Wayne's World.\n\nHowever, despite this films success, it was actually fraught with production problems and a budget that got way out control. Firstly, Dan Aykroyd's script was a massive 324 pages (three times longer than a normal screenplay) which he jokingly bound in the cover of the Yellow Pages before delivering it to John Landis to edit it down. Also, Landis' outlandish car chases and vehicular pile-up's throughout the end of the film sent the budget $10million over it's initial $17.5. This wasn't helped by John Belushi's spiralling drug habit which would cause him to disappear for lengthy periods from the set.\n\nThese issues aside, though, The Blues Brothers still struck a chord with audiences and critics alike - even the Vatican gave it the thumbs-up for being a good Catholic movie - and it has since went on to become a cult classic. Over 30 years later, it's easy to see why...\n\nThe story doesn't really amount to very much but the titular characters are hard to resist as they ooze a laid-back cool, dressed in their iconic black suits and dark Ray-Bans - a good ten years before Tarantino's similarly attired Reservoir Dogs. Jake and Elwood manage to get themselves in all sorts of scrapes and upset a whole horde of different people; a machine gun, bazooka wielding disgruntled ex-girlfriend (Carrie Fisher), the Illinois Nazi Party, country band The Good Ol' Boys and, not to mention, the sheer tally of cops, all in hot pursuit. It's riotously over the top and when the film reaches it's denouement it has already crossed the ridiculous border but Landis and Aykroyd know this. They simply don't care. And that's what makes the film so enjoyable. There's an unashamedly free-spirited nature to the proceedings which is highly infectious but nothing entertains more than the magnificent musical numbers from a choice selection of Soul and R&B talents. Among the many toe-tapping highlights are Aretha Franklin's \"Think\", Cab Calloway's \"Minnie the Moocher\", John Lee Hooker's \"Boom Boom\" and the great Ray Charles with \"Shake a Tail Feather\". \n\nThe Blues Brothers has stood the test of time and truly is one of a kind. It's provides action, laughs and song and dance numbers that haven't aged a bit. It's admittedly raucous, loud and chaotic but as far as I'm concerned, anything goes when you're \"on a mission from God\".\n\nMark Walker",

Elwood (Aykroyd) is a laid back harmonica player, who even though has a record of driving recklessly, can still be trusted by any other fellow friend or musician, and his brother, Joliet Jake Blues (Belushi). Jake, who has been released from Joliet Prison, and has reunited with his brother, along with a scheme up his sleeve.\nJake wants to reunite ''the band'', and Elwood takes some time to think about if The Blues Brothers should reunite, or if he should continue selling cars for microphones, and commencing car chases inside of malls. \nElwood decides. Of course, the band must be united, but sadly, the band members, who are real-life, talented musicians, have gone their separate ways. The brothers then go all out in Chicago to find and bribe their members help make The Blues Brothers have a great return. \nI must say, this movie is odd. It's weird. Somehow, John Landis and his incredible cast manage to deliver us a film that has a brilliant flow and memorable scenes that we can't help but like it. First of all, the comedy is hilarious. It's hard to make a lot of people laugh, and The Blues Brother's cracked me up. The car chase scenes were hysterical. I'll bet anyone that more cars were destroyed in this film than the first season of ''The Dukes of Hazzard''.\nSpeaking of that great cast, you will see plenty of notable musicians and actors, such as Aretha Franklin, Cab Galloway, James Brown, Ray Charles, Steve Lawrence, John Candy, and even Steven Spielberg.\nYes, you will see plenty of bizarre, and not to mention, random things in The Blues Brothers. If you're up to seeing cars being crushed, a city's police force going insane, rednecks, an insane Nun, and ''Illinois Nazis'', than you will love this film.",

When Jake is released from prison and reteams with Elwood, they find that an orphanage needs $5000 in order to continue functioning. Believing this fundraiser is a mission from God, the Brothers put together their old rhythm and blues band, and dodge Illinois Nazis, Good Ole Boys, Jake's ex-girlfriend and the Law as they try desperately to put on a show for the ages.\n\nSNL alum John Belushi and Dan Aykroyd reprise their roles from the sketch comedy show as Jake and Elwood, while a who's who of the music and film worlds join them in the cast - Cab Calloway, Carrie Fisher, Aretha Franklin, Ray Charles, James Brown, John Candy, Kathleen Freeman, Twiggy, Frank Oz, Steven Spielberg, John Lee Hooker and Joe Walsh all appear in the cast. In addition, some of America's finest session musicians appear as the Blues Brothers band - Steve Cropper, Donald \"Duck\" Dunn, Murphy Dunne, Willie Hall, Bones Malone, Blue Lou Marini, Matt \"Guitar\" Murphy and Alan Rubin all lend their talents.\n\nThen there's the music - Ray Charles plays \"Shake a Tail Feather\", Aretha Franklin lets loose on her classic hit \"Think\", James Brown sings a gospel tune, and the Blues Brothers play everything from \"Theme from Rawhide\" to \"Everybody Needs Somebody To Love\" and \"Sweet Home Chicago\". The soundtrack is arguably the best in Hollywood, no questions asked.\n\nThe jokes are on-point, every line is quotable - it's a cult classic. There's no avoiding that. A magnificent, brilliant film.\n\nUnfortunately, RT doesn't let me give away 6 stars, so I'm giving it 5 instead.",

The plot can be a little difficult to follow sometimes, mainly because the film tends to get sidetracked by all the wacky, seemingly random gags and characters. While some of the jokes can seem random, it's not a machine gun of comedy, and at least the jokes have some relevance to the plot, even if that relevance comes later on. The performances from the film's main cast are very good, even if some of the characters aren't as special, and I find the main characters to be really appealing. The film certainly knows how to flaunt its style, which I might have expected from a film called \"The Blues Brothers\". Speaking of that, the film's musical style is a whimsical combination of old blues and R&B, which works well with the film's atmosphere. For me, the best part of the film is its final scenes, which all add up to one truly zany spectacle.

This is an excellent comedy that is brilliantly acted and directed and it has many memorable moments that standout. The pairing of Dan Aykroyd and John Belushi is terrific, and they have great chemistry. The film blends well thought out comedy with an entertaining musical numbers that are far better than any other musical film that I have seen. I must confess I never was the biggest fan of musicals, I found them to be average at best, entertaining depending on what was written in the script, but never anything memorable either. With the Blues Brothers, it's quite different, there are enough moments of dialogue here to compliment the musical numbers, and it makes for a truly engaging film that is entertaining from start to finish.  I really enjoyed the film, it was a finely executed blend of comedy and music and it has to rank among one of the finest genre films ever made. The script is solid, and thoroughly entertaining, and the viewer is sucked into its humorous and memorable plot that is elevated by Aykroyd's and Belushi screen chemistry. Something simple goes a long way, and in the case of this film, it proves exactly right. The Blues Brothers in terms of story is nothing elaborate, but where it stands out, are the performances by its leads. The chemistry between the two lead actors is what elevates the simple plot to greatness and it's a fun; entertaining picture that in the long run is a memorable piece of comedy. The Blues Brothers is a must see film, a terrific performance by Dan Aykroyd and John Belushi , of which Belushi delivers a highly memorable performance, one that defined his sadly too short career.",

With all of the over-the-top car chases, ominous nuns, and clever quips in this film, there are also some absolutely fantastic musical cameos from the likes of Aretha Franklin, Ray Charles and Cab Calloway. Aykroyd and Belushi are a hilarious team in this flick, and the persona that they put on with these well-dressed, fedora-donning singers is perfect. I don't think that Aykroyd's character removes his sunglasses for the entire film, and we only see Belushi's character do so for a particularly interesting scene near the end. We don't end up knowing much about these characters, and that's exactly the way that this movie is supposed to be executed; they are supposed to remain a bit mysterious. The movie's ridiculous tone gives itself a hand, as this allows some of the most ludicrous things in the movie, such as how a nun can close a door without touching it or how a car can land the jumps that these two do, to be forgiven by the phrase, \"Hey, it's a comedy.\" My only complaint with this movie is that the chase scene through Chicago City Hall at the end goes on a bit long for an already long movie, and doesn't contain either laughs or music, this film's strong suit. This didn't distract from how fantastic this film was, however, and I would watch it again anytime.",

No, I didn't really like \"The Blues Brothers.\" And that's okay. I don't have to like every movie widely regarded as a classic of the American cinematic arts. In fact, I can plainly see why this one is so sweepingly adored. The infectious dance numbers, the joy-inducing cameos, the bombastic set pieces. It's all fairly enjoyable and - in fact - I enjoyed a lot of it. It's just that, even though there's a general throughline here, there's also this episodic nature to the majority of the second act that didn't really dazzle me in any way. Jake and Elwood have to go to X place and get X person to do X, they do it, and then have to go to X place and get X person to do X as well. It's all too piecemeal for my tastes. But, again, there's still a lot here to be enjoyed and \"enjoy\" I did (for the most part).",

They got so many great artist (some would say legends) like Aretha Franklin, John Lee Hooker, Big Walter Horton, James Brown, Ray Charles and more. There is no movie that can easily compare. Also there are the songs performed by the Blues Brothers themselves which gave an awesome performance and are a welcome addition to the score. But it does not end here. They took also great effort in delivering an entertaining story, great humor, remarkable quotes and create characters you never forget. I wont spoil any of the former parts because I believe this is a movie you should experience yourself. The combination of Director John Landis and the chemistry between John Belushi / Dan Akroyd is pure gold. I will say the quote \u201cMovies like this will not be made anymore\u201d is a fitting description. Overall this is a must see movie with a must listen soundtrack you need to own for your collection. Special warning: Blues Brothers 2000 is the worst sequel I know (except the score) and the only movie that destroyed the prequel. Yes, that is possible (I couldn't believe that was even a thing before. Though only extreme fanboys say something like that). If you watched it you will know what I mean.",
