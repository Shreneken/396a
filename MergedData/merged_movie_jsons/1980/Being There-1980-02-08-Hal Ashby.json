            "content": "The original \"Forrest Gump\" came out in 1979 when Hal Ashby's \"Being There\" was first released. A quietly brilliant, hilarious, heart-wrenching and heart-warming motion picture that showed how great Peter Sellers (Oscar-nominated) was and how limitless his range was. He stars as a gardener at an old mansion in Washington, D.C. who has never been outside of the owner's small piece of property. When the owner dies, he has to leave the only home he has ever known. Sellers has no knowledge of anything except what he sees on television and he has a strange sort of child-like innocence that endears him to all he comes into contact with. After a minor accident, Sellers is taken to the home of a ridiculously wealthy political lobbyist (Melvyn Douglas in his second Oscar-winning performance) who is literally being kept alive as he has a rare form of cancer. Douglas immediately takes a liking to Sellers and so does his much-younger wife (Shirley MacLaine). Sellers is now in the spotlight though as he gets to meet the president (Jack Warden) and slowly starts to gain popularity and political support from those around him. Of course Sellers does not realize any of this as his understanding of such things are beyond his somewhat limited mental capabilities. A simply brilliant film that is carried by Sellers' amazing personal best performance. Everyone else is adequate, but this is Sellers' show. Douglas won the Oscar mainly due to sympathy votes, but surprisingly Sellers would die before Douglas as he passed away less than six months after receiving his Oscar nod of a massive heart attack. As good as Dustin Hoffman was in \"Kramer vs. Kramer\", I still wish that Sellers would have won the Oscar for this role which is one of the finest performances ever throughout the entire history of the cinema. 5 stars out of 5.",

            "content": "Peter Sellers should have taken home the Academy Award for his role in Being There. A lifetime of comedies behind him, Sellers ended his career as an actor and a comic legend with this classic. Hard to believe that this was made over 20 years ago, it is still as funny as ever. Since then, no other comedian has captured the raw talent of comedy that Sellers could create. The silent comedy and the physical comedy that Sellers made was not only timeless but funnier than most of the comedy we see in film today. Second to maybe his role in Lolita and in the Pink Panther series, Sellers is not only funny, but gives his best performance in Being There. A terrific story with interesting and real characters, Being There is a delight.",

            "content": "It truly does shame me to admit that, coming into this film, I had only ever seen one movie with Peter Sellers \u0096 and that was his extraordinary three-role performance in Stanley Kubrick's 'Dr Strangelove, or: How I Learned To Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb.' Having now also seen 'Being There,' Sellers' second-to-last film, I am convinced that I'll be seeing a lot more of his work in the near future. Though it is not, in fact, Sellers' final film, 'Being There' is often described as the comedy star's swan song, since the last film before his 1980 death, 'The Fiendish Plot of Dr. Fu Manchu,' was generally poorly-received'Being There' traces the story of Chance (Sellers), a simple-minded gardener for a wealthy old man. For as far back as he can remember, Chance has made his home at the old man's house, spending his time tending to the roses and the other flowers. The maid, Louise, looks after all his needs. He has never left the house, and he has never travelled in an automobile. Everything he knows about the outside world has come from television, and, whenever he is not gardening, he simply \"likes to watch.\" However, when the old man dies, Louise leaves the house, and Chance is left to fend for himself.Chance's absent-minded wanderings about a city he doesn't understand ultimately lead him to the home of wealthy but terminally-ill private citizen Benjamin Turnbull Rand (Melvyn Douglas) and his younger wife Eve (Shirley MacLaine). Chance's spluttered self-introduction of \"Chance the gardener\" gives him the prestigious title of \"Chauncey Gardiner,\" and his quiet-spoken nature is mistaken for wisdom. During a visit by the President of the United States (Jack Warden), his simple gardening anecdotes are interpreted as discerning metaphors of the current state of the nation's economy. \"In the garden, growth has it seasons,\" Chance explains. \"First comes spring and summer, but then we have fall and winter. And then we get spring and summer again.\" When the President quotes Chance's wise words in an address to the nation, he becomes something of a celebrity, even appearing on television himself, where he expresses the need for a capable \"gardener\" to tend to the country's needs. Despite his high-profile, the FBI and the CIA are completely baffled as to how they could have absolutely no background information on \"Mr. Gardiner,\" and they bicker about how only a cleverly-trained secret agent could keep such a ghostly past. Only one man, Benjamin Rand's doctor (Richard A. Dysart), begins to suspect the truth behind Chance's simple-spoken demeanour, though he keeps his suspicions quiet when he realises what a profound positive effect Chance has on those around him. The dying Benjamin Rand is given the strength to pass peacefully into death, and his wife Eve is given somebody who would stay with her in her most painful hours.The very final shot of the film has evoked countless heated discussions since the film's original release. What could possibly be the meaning of Chance walking on the surface of the lake? It is quite obviously a Biblical reference to Christ, but what does it mean? Is Chance the saviour that so many of the film's troubled characters have been searching for? Does the man's simple innocence, uncorrupted and unbiased, offer him a certain grace? Is Chance able to walk on water simply because nobody has told him that he cannot? Or, perhaps there is a more prosaic explanation. It is not inconceivable that there are stepping stones hidden just beneath the surface of the water, and, as it had served him well countless times before, could sheer chance simply have prevented his falling into the lake? 'Being There' is a thought-provoking film, and also a clever satire of American politics and the media. Sellers is brilliant as Chance the gardener; though his character remains pretty much the same throughout, with very little personal development at all, Sellers' performance never loses steam. A strong supporting cast helps make an somewhat improbable premise almost believable, and I was particularly impressed with Melvyn Douglas as Benjamin Rand, and, indeed, he won the Best Supporting Actor Oscar for his performance. This is an enchanting film, and very much worth watching.",

            "review_title": "A Masterpiece",
            "content": "\"To see me as a person on screen would be one of the dullest experiences you could ever wish to experience\" - quote from Peter Sellers.Peter Sellers had many quotes like this in which he spoke of his near self-hatred, hated seeing himself, and that when he was not doing comedy, he was dull and unfunny. That makes his portrayal of Chauncey Gardner that much more amazing, because he portrays a very simple man totally comfortable within himself.Being There is a great film. It deals with a simple premise - if you act in a certain way, people will make unquestioned assumptions about you. Chauncy is slow witted and has the mind of small child, and all that he knows in gardening. However, he dresses in nice suits, has impeccable manners and is not shy, so he is accepted into social circles. When he speaks of gardening, his ramblings are mistaken for metaphors and he is instantly considered an economic genius.This is wrapped around a beautiful film, in which Chauncey wanders from one circumstance into another, never changing his demeanor, never faltering. I an reminded of Mr Magoo walking blindly down a succession of steel girders thinking they are stairs. Essentially, he is not in peril because he does not know he is in peril. The charm of this film exists in Chauncey's unwavering personality, and how it affects the world of phonies and bureaucrats he has come to inhabit.Although the film sometimes comes across as forced, and some of the encounters with Eve (Shirley MacLaine) come off forced, the film is still a masterpiece. Its theme and Sellers' stunning performance lauch it into the catoegory of greatness.There is much debate amongst the lovers of this film over its final scene. If you have not seen it, rent it, and draw your conclusions. Like many great movies steeped in mood and metaphor, we are left to draw our own conclusions.The phrase \"I like to watch\" has become so famous from this movie - it refers to Chauncey's love for TV and the fact that it is his reference point for his existance. (Such has when he tries to click a remote to thwart off muggers). But there is a great deal more to Being There. It is a Top 10 Selection of 70s, Hal Ashby's best film and Peter Sellers greatest performance. **** out of ****.",

He is Chauncy Gardner, a man suddenly bereft of his existence, out on his own. His simplistic view of the world is based on the television that he watches endlessly when he is not doing his job. There is the wonderful scene where he is mugged and he uses his remote control to try to get rid of the muggers. The script gently moves him into a tremendous position of power he doesn't even understand, and yet it keeps him dignified, not a comic buffoon, as he may have been portrayed today. Even when the chariots come crashing down, he has that gentle soul. What we get with him is the genuine article and since he didn't know to exploit, he can't really be seen as anything but the soulful fellow he is. Excellent portrayal of a character.",

            "review_title": "a biting black comedy of a detached character in a particular state of mind",
            "content": "Being There will get you thinking about what it means to be taken in by television, as well as the government, and the better (or lesser) intentions of people in power, and works on more than one level. It's a pure slice of oddball life, the story of a man who got more than likely tucked away into some kind of perfunctory manner by the only things in life with any significance being television and gardening. No more or less. How does one end up living out in the world, however, if this is all there is for the span of a long life? Jerzy Kosinski's idea is to place this fragmented, polite but assuredly clueless fellow where double standards rule the day. He meets a businessman after a limo accident, and by his outward appearance seeming to fit a certain mold he takes him in. The man is connected in his dealings, all the way up to the president, as an adviser. All Chance (Peter Sellers) can do is say what he knows- not only does he not know lies or how to lie, he's been sort of conditioned, in a way, to not fully comprehend good and evil either. But his words carry meaning, somehow, and he becomes a celebrity all the while not really connected to what's going on. Rarely before has detachment and the subtleties of the human condition been this engaging.There are three major factors for this, which is the control of wit and truth in the screenplay by Kosinski, who won't go for the cheapest laughs or too mocking in satirical form, but in the moments of dead-pan exchange and the bluntness of Chance's character. Sellers, of course, is at the very top of his game, and that's a first factor, along with the rest of the excellent cast (MacClaine is maybe at her best, as I've not seen too much that wowed me until now; Douglass gives a compassionate performance that speaks to the issue of illness and the end of existence; Warden is surprisingly adept at playing a flabbergasted, weak-willed president). He leads it as if going for something that seems like it shouldn't be interesting. It's a guy who doesn't really have much expression, aside from some bits of joy, like meeting the president, or in becoming (somewhat) part of MacClaine's character's love-life, or in seeing someone die. But even then it's a muted, half-way expression, and the repression that Sellers makes real here is staggering. The term 'comfortably numb' popped in my head once or twice regarding Chance the gardener, and Sellers makes this as real as possible, and sometimes as funny as possible, but for the most part it's his most mature work where there isn't any cheating- what you see, with his mind transmogrified by TV forever- is what you get.Ashby, meanwhile, makes this a very successfully directed film by putting a tone to the picture that is not really like the Chance character because you want to see where he goes next. He'll put in a sequence that is hysterically funny, like when Chance is in the limo watching the Cheech and Chong bit Basketball Jones, or in Chance's reaction to pure sexual advances from MacClaine, or in several little things. But he also makes it on a bedrock of a level of plausibility, at least in some part. It's doubtful if a man would have this sort of effect on a mass public, once appearing in public anyway, and have his words 100% to heart, because there would be over-analysis and eventually a crack in the whole character's intent that gardening tactics are universal. And yet it's even more plausible, however, to see what effect words do have when taken out of context AS the context, and how perceptions in America create more than what one might bargain for, and eventually become a mantra of sorts. That Chance also is quite a dim fellow- not a dimwit exactly, he's not necessarily stupid- brings some extra resonance in the political swamp of today.Ashby times all of this as though he were certain when to just let the everyday come in as something more. He puts in great musical choices, and a few very memorable images (I loved the shot of Chance walking on the middle-road to the Capital building), and crowns it with a screenplay that doesn't, unlike TV for Chance, take things too simple. Not that there isn't almost a silent-film whimsy to this all, but there's so much to Being There that it will stick with you for many days afterwords.",

            "review_title": "A quiet, slowly paced film with a magnificent Peter Sellers",
            "content": "Peter Sellers last and arguably his greatest performance. He died, aged 54, in 1980, the year the film was released. This is one of the best films I've seen in a long time. I taped it some time ago from television and recently saw it for the third time and it keeps fascinating me. The film has a beautiful dream-like atmosphere - dark, moody, absolutely mesmerizing! Many of the proceedings might be a little improbable but it shouldn't be viewed to rationally.The plot is quite simple with Sellers playing the main character, Chance (or \"Chauncey\") Gardener, who becomes homeless, when the master of the house he lived in and for whom he maintained the garden, dies. He is a grown man with the mind of a small child who lead a cocoon-like existence during his whole life, isolated from the outside world. His sole interests are gardening and television, which he frequently expresses with \"I like to watch\". After a small accident with a limo, he winds up staying at the mansion of a rich tycoon (Melvyn Douglas) and his wife (Shirley Maclaine), who are close to the president. He befriends the couple and slowly becomes acquainted with the higher circles in Washington. Because of his slowly mannered way of speaking, his politeness, neatness and impeccable dressing, he is somehow mistaken for some lost professor. In a hilarious meeting, when he first meets the president, he's asked for his opinion on the weak state of the nation's economy. Off course, he doesn't know anything about the subject, so he starts reflecting his visions upon gardening, \"Spring and summer, fall and winter, it's all a cycle and everything starts to grow again\", which are conceived as brilliant metaphors for explaining economic cycles. Chauncey Gardener is so disarming with his simplified views of life, he is celebrated as some kind of genius. His response to he question \"What newspapers do you read?\" is \"I only watch TV\", which instantly turns him into a hero for admitting he gets his information solely from television and in the eyes of the general public makes him the most honest man linked to The White House in a long time.The reputation of this film has risen steadily over the last years and rightfully so. Jerzy Kosinski's novel is transferred to the screen into a dark (literally down-lit) and sombre comedy by director Hal Ashby, who managed to make an expertly paced film, consistent in tone and mood. The film boasts great performances by veteran Melvyn Douglas and Shirley Maclaine, who even does a masturbation scene! But it's Peter Sellers who enters the pantheon of the all-time legendary performances with a simply magnificent portrayal of Chance Gardener. For long this was his pet project and for over nine years he tried to get it filmed. When it was finally green-lighted, he painstakingly researched and prepared for the role. The voice in particular demanded his attention as he listened to his own voice on a tape recorder and endlessly compared one sound to another. Forget about comparing his role to Tom Hanks with \"Forrest Gump\", the other mindless observer of American society. It doesn't even come close. Tom Hanks got the Oscar but Peter Sellers gives his character an unmatched complexity in a far superior film, that if anyone should get the Oscar, he should (he was nominated, though). Even after repeated viewings, it not only holds up, it reveals something new and adds a new layer. A rare achievement. In a few weeks time, I'm in North-Carolina and hopefully will manage to make a visit to Asheville and get a chance to visit the Biltmore Estate (the estate of the Vanderbilts), where most of the film was shot. A beautiful movie, something to behold.Camera Obscura --- 10/10",

Like Ruth Gordon in \"Harold and Maude\" Peter Sellers as Chance the Gardner tells us a few truths that stand at the center as well as quite outside the box of our daily lives. Obvious and unique. Contradictions co-existing in perfect harmony. Peter Sellers is superb, without ever betraying the grayness of his existence. It took me a while, I must confess, to settle in. I had seen the Goeffry Rush film about Sellers's life and it implied an effort to take those thoughts and images out of my mind and allow Chancey, without Sellers, to take me away. He did, he took me away completely. What a remarkable piece of acting. A special mention should go to Melvyn Douglas as well. Moving and powerful at the end of a legendary career.

It has the benefit of fine source material adapted very well for the screen by the writer of the novel, Jerzy Kosinski, but Asbhy's fine work as director and Caleb Deschanel's brilliant cinematography, in addition to some fine editing and Peter Sellers' absolute best performance elevate this film from good tragicomedy to a minor masterpiece, and a criminally overlooked one, though not nearly as overlooked as Ashby's \"Bound for Glory\".I liked \"Being There\" the first time I saw it, but like many truly great films I did not come to appreciate it fully until after a few more viewings, including a revelatory study in a film class of the shot composition in the film, which still astounds me. There are films where nearly every frame is beautiful, and \"Being There\" is one of those films.As a piece of writing, the screenplay for \"Being There\", Kosinski's only film work, is surprisingly effective and does not suffer from any major flaws. The film, like the novel it is based on, moves at a natural, yet surprisingly swift pace and the film never plods. It is a joy to see the thematic content of \"Being There\" unfold so I won't go into any detail on that, but it is handled beautifully and the film has extraordinary depth.This film is a beautiful, intelligent, good-natured look at human nature.

            "content": "The slow and illiterate gardener Chance (Peter Sellers) has spent all his life inside the house of Mr. Jennings in a poor area of Washington D.C. His only contact with the outside world was through television. When Mr. Jennings dies, the house is shut-down by the family lawyer and Chance is forced to leave the place. While wandering on the streets, a limousine hits his leg and the owner, Eve Rand (Shirley MacLaine), invites him to go to her house to be treated by her husband's doctor and avoid any trouble in the hospital. She misunderstands his name and calls him Chauncey Gardner. When the simple Chance is introduced to her husband, Benjamin Rand (Melvyn Douglas), that is terminally ill with anemia, he becomes his friend and Ben interprets his wordings as metaphoric, transforming Chance in adviser of President Bobby (Jack Warden) and prominent figure in the world of economy and politics.I must confess that this is the first time that I watch \"Being There\" and my first thought was that \"Forrest Gump\" is visibly inspired in this movie. Peter Sellers is once again fantastic in the role of a man that does not know that he does not know and therefore is capable to achieve everything. The forty-five years old Shirley MacLaine is still an extremely beautiful and seductive woman in this film. Melvyn Douglas has a top-notch performance in this movie, unfortunately one of his last movies. Jack Warden is hilarious in the role of an annoying president. The situations are surrealistic but seem to be realistic, and indeed it is a great joke with politicians and their cynical world.

And then, in a scene that completely flips the film on its head, Chance walks on water! That scene is the cinematographic equivalent of staring at one of those stereograms when the hidden 3D image suddenly leaps out at you. It's a shocking moment, beautifully handled, and you're immediately forced to question everything you've seen in the film and your assumptions about it: why does Chance have no concept of time? Is it because an eternal being wouldn't need one? When Eve makes a pass at Chance is he being tempted by, and tested against, original sin? Was the Washington Cop who, we assume, is calling in a report of a simpleton on the loose, actually compelled to do exactly what Chance told him to do? Does Chance speak Russian? How? Is this because all the tongues of man are as one to him? Does Chance have the power to decide when the time is right for Ben to die? Did the 'old man' meet a similar fate, and does Chance lay his hand on the old man's forehead to see if he is cold or to bless him?If we accept that Chance has indeed revealed his divinity to us then the whole film flips once more and takes on a far darker aspect. Is the decline in the Presidents powers linked to the rise of Chance? Is his TV broadcast the modern equivalent of the 'sermon on the mount'? And, crucially, is all his talk of gardening a chilling metaphor for the immanent fate of mankind?A shepherd might be content to tend his flock, but Chance is a gardener, and he might have a great deal of pruning and weeding to do before Eden \u0096 his garden - is restored to its former glory.

But what's interesting about it is how it was copied by Nichole Kidman in \"Moulin Rouge.\"Another good thing is the already quaint notions about TeeVee. These were days when there was absolutely no notion that TeeVee was anything but useless, and that watching even a little bit was a sort of trailer park activity. And these were the days before we had a president that if not stupid, speaks as if he is. Sorta takes the edge off this in present terms, but it provokes a kind of sad nostalgia that things would have changed in such a way that the satire here is completely gone. Its as if Lilliputians were my new neighbors.There's also some very strong staging here, very strong indeed. One scene in particular has two men walking in this fine, rich house, framed in a very precisely architectural way. A long lens flattens the depth. Two servants slowly follow them with wheelchairs at the ready. Its a shot everyone should know.I have a list of films that are so important or groundbreaking that you really must see them before you die. Everyone probably has a similar list. But no one I know has a list of scenes. Perhaps the movie as a whole isn't wholly transcendent, but some scene is, or some property like an extraordinary set or design.I wonder why it is that we don't have someone like Peter Sellers today. No Robin Williams, Peter Carey or Steve Martin, none of our race comedians, are anything close. The particular quality I mean is the ability to have a conversation with the audience about the character without the overt winking and theatrics that others who can connect this way do.Ted's Evaluation -- 3 of 3: Worth watching.",

It was almost the last film from Peter Seller's who gives an Oscar nominated performance. He died a few months after the film's release.Seller's plays Chance a simple minded middle aged gardener in a rich man's townhouse in Washington. He cannot read or write, the maid fed him and looked after him. When the wealthy benefactor dies he is turfed out on to the streets. We have no idea how he came into this household. He could had been the old man's son or some stray who he just took care of. He tended the garden, watched television and no provision for his well being was made after the old man's death.After wandering the streets aimlessly Chance is accidentally hit by a limousine carrying Eve (Shirley Maclaine) who takes him home to be examined by their doctor who is already looking after her wealthy dying husband Ben (Melvyn Douglas.)Impressed by his wardrobe, which is basically his master's vintage clothes they come to realise that he is someone down on his luck, a businessman brought low in hard times and ask him to stay at the house.Chance is a man of few words, he likes to watch television. The only thing he knows about is gardening. After talking to the President who is visiting Ben where in essence he talks about the seasons he comes across as some wise sage when the President repeats his words to the media.His simple answers to complex problems makes him a media personality who takes it all seriously, the rest of the film is Chance being put into various potentially embarrassing positions where you think he would be found out, such as a television talk show or a reception with the high and mighty and no one suspects that he is a simpleton (although Chance might be Autistic.)Director Hal Ashby made political films, this is a political satire and a perceptive one. This is about elites and how they get taken in by folksy charm and also dispense it to the rest of us in the most cynical way. How else can one explain the popularity of the likes of Rush Limbaugh with the right whingers. Ben when he dies is buried in a pyramid like tomb with an eye. A symbol of the Illuminati I believe.Sellers is spot on as Chance, he plays his character with one note, but it is the right note. None of the over the top histrionics he was known for in his comedy parts. I am glad that he went out on a high. However director Hal Ashby should not be forgotten for crafting a simple but intelligent film.",

The story is a little far fetched to say the least but I think that Peter Sellars is outstanding, how he managed to act this character so well is beyond me.

'I have no use for people on welfare but if I am to be perfectly honest with myself, they probably have no use for me.'\" Jack Warden, as the President of the United States, is giving this apopemptic eulogy at the funeral of his criminally rich old conservative friend, Melvin Douglas.\"I have spoken with kings, but every time I have met one, I have asked myself some important questions. Can I beat him in a foot race? Can I throw a ball farther than he?. . . What does a man need? A good bowl of chili now and then. . . We enter life naked and that's how we leave. And no accountant can audit life in our favor.\" Warden goes on with this ill-crafted, anger-ridden speech while the pall bearers in their glossy million-dollar shoes carry Douglas' casket to its final resting place. They whisper among themselves about whom they will run for president at the end of Warden's term and they decide on Chance, the Gardener, Peter Sellers, whose name they believe to be Chauncey Gardener. The decision is reached in front of the tomb itself. The tomb is a monument to human vanity, greed, and maniacal egocentricity -- a replica of the pyramid on the back of the dollar bill with the all-seeing eye at the top. The motto under which this rabid materialist will lie is \"Life is a State of Mind.\" The problem with their plan to run Chance for president, although no one knows it despite his national exposure, is that Chance is a total idiot. He was raised by a man in an isolated mansion and has now been thrown out after the old man's death. He knows absolutely nothing except a smattering of things he's learned from watching TV programs at random. Oh, and he knows about gardening. Politically he's a joke, but the difficulty with political jokes is that they sometimes get elected.It's not an especially logical fantasy so it doesn't deserve too much in the way of analysis. You could drive a semi through many of the plot holes, and improbabilities abound.But it's funny, at times very funny, and sad as well. Peter Sellers is fine as the slow, mysterious, and ingratiating friend of the Rand family and Melvyn Douglas is occasionally moving as the arthritic, dying robber baron, being wheeled about the Biltmore Mansion in North Carolina, wheezing and railing about taxes. Shirley MacClaine is Douglas' well-groomed and loving wife, thoughtful, sensitive, horny.This was directed by Hal Ashby, not a prolific director but one with a touch for sophisticated irony. Here he does a splendid job, giving the film just the right pace. A viewer won't find many belly laughs but will smile quite a lot. The admirable photography is by Caleb Deschanel. Images have a burnished sheen, like old black mahogany that's been polished weekly for a hundred years.But, as I say, you shouldn't expect one event to follow another linearly.

            "content": "Being There is a tough sell to a first time viewer, incredibly slow and surprisingly sad, it's a film that is thought of quite high yet very rarely mentioned. The story sees a simple minded gardener called Chance forced to go it alone in the big wide world after working and living at the same estate all his life, his employer has passed away, and all looks bleak until he is involved in a minor accident.In the car that hit his leg is the kindly Eve Rand, taking him home to the family estate for treatment, Eve and her ill husband, Ben, take him to their hearts, and pretty soon Chance's dry and simple speakings are being taken out of context and thought of as deeply profound political and world observations.That's about all you need to know as regards the plot, it's a wonderfully scripted tale about the infinite wisdom of a simpleton who is, lets face it, oblivious to the world around him. The writing is excellent from Jerzy Kosinski (his novel as well) with the capable direction from Hal Ashby benefiting from sumptuous photography courtesy of Caleb Deschanel. But it's with the cast that Being There most triumphs, Peter Sellers had actively pursued the project for many years, and his wait was worth it for he turns in a performance unlike anything he had done before, definitely a career high as he holds all in the palm of his hand as the intriguingly sad protagonist, Chance. He unluckily lost out to Dustin Hoffman (Kramer Vs Kramer) for the best actor Oscar. Shirley MacLaine is marvellous as the sex starved Eve Rand, while Melvyn Douglas bagged the best supporting actor Oscar for his portrayal of the fading away Benjamin Rand.So technically the film is spot on, and it's thematic heart is one to be involved with on a basic emotional level, yet you just get a sense of being bogged down entering the final quarter, the feeling that this should have been cut down to a 110 minute movie maximum. It's highly recommended cinema for those serious about the structure side of the craft, whilst those in need of a simpleton fable are certainly well catered for, and thankfully it's memorable for all the right reasons. 7/10",

Several years latter while looking for another movie, I happen across this video and read the review. Chance Gardner played charmingly by Peter Sellers, ( I think that is what the reviewer wrote) stumbles his way into the upper crest where he is mistaken for someone with deep knowledge of the world. Other reviews point out this movie is cynical characterization of self absorbed people in politics and media. As a kid I didn't get that, and now on further reflection what I liked about this movie was how these people where drawn to Chances innocence. In some ways Forrest Gump tried to attempt to tell this story line, but only manages to rehash old stereotypes. Being There depicts in clever, real characters who use a veil of politeness to cover up a cynicisim they have of their world and their own power. But for a kid and maybe why it has a cult following is because the heart of the show, whats addicting about is no matter how self absorbed we become, our best nature is drawn to a simple life, absent of complications. After watching the movie again, the dark comedy is more apparent, but I am happy to say that in the \"Life and death of Peter Sellers\", Sellers himself interpreted the character as I thought of it when I was kid. Gardner is a man who is sublimely content with no past and no future, and therefore no worries. As a kid I kind of new that as innocence. So if you rent this movie don't just see it as a black comedy, but also see it how a kid might, and for that matter how Peter Sellers saw it.",

            "content": "This is one of those movies that probably shouldn't be as good as it is. Any one of a number of small decisions could have sent the entire film off course. It's a credit to Hal Ashby that with this film he was able to maintain the kind of humanism and balance that would make the film not only convincing but heartbreaking. Peter Sellers turns in one of his greatest performances, projecting a kind of unearthly stillness and gravity that leaves itself open to the audience as well as the other characters for interpretation.Sellers plays an imbecile named Chance who has never been outside of the house where he has served as a gardener for decades. For a man whose entire life has been spent watching plants grow and watching television, simply \"being there\" is the real world is a fresh experience. He should probably be in an institution, but by the end of the film he's hurtling towards the Presidency. Of course this has often been interpreted as very dark satire, but I think the film is more concerned with people as individuals than society as such. Chance himself is like a magic mirror who shows everyone what they want to see, because he has nothing to offer for himself. I don't think that this is so much a cynical film as a sad one. You look at this character Shirley MacLaine plays, and I really don't think that the film -- as pathetic as it makes her seem at times -- is really condemning her nor casting her in any light as \"typical.\" The fact that Chance can bring her happiness without actually doing anything is pathetic, not laughable.So if the film is a satire, it's only incidentally a satire. Like St. Peter, Chance can literally walk on water as long as nobody tells him that he shouldn't be able to. Chance is a man who's been liberated without ever wanting to be free. This seems a theme in many of Ashby's films. For example, in \"Harold and Maude\", Harold never knew that he even wanted to be alive until he met Maude. In \"The Last Detail,\" Nicholson and his buddy never had a clue just how enslaved they were to the military/social hierarchy until they saw what freedom could be like in the Randy Quaid character. With Chance, however, there's no self-realization, no awareness. He doesn't even know how he has changed other people's lives, and his own philosophy and perspective are as solid as the water he walks on (to him).",

This is one of those films that you have to talk about after seeing it, and you'll find endless points of view to consider.  More than that, however, this film is historically fascinating.

We're just given the assumption that he never saw the world except through television. This is hard to believe but Peter Sellers' performance makes us forget about logic. He manages a stunning mix of being a wise old man and a mentally retarded child. Scenes where he tries to convert his TV experiences into reality or thinks he can just switch the channel in an unpleasant situation are cute on the one hand and hurt a little on the other.The film lives because of Sellers and because of the secrets around him.

The two could not be more different. Based on the wonderful novel by Jerzy Kosinski ( and adapted for the screen by the author ), the former stars Peter as 'Chance', a man of limited intelligence who has spent most of his life tending a rich man's garden. When his employer dies, the house is put up for sale, and Chance is ordered to leave. Carrying a suitcase, he ventures out into the world for the very first time, his only knowledge of it coming from television. Naturally he is completely baffled. Things look up when he is involved in a minor road accident, and meets Ben Rand ( Melvin Douglas ) and his wife Eve ( Shirley Maclaine ). Ben, a U.S. Senator, offers to put Chance up at his palatial country home whilst he recuperates. The Rands mistake Chance's occupation for his name, calling him 'Chauncey Gardener'. They also mistake Chance's home-spun gardening anecdotes for the utterances of a genius. Soon he is being talked of as a future President...'Being There' is sometimes funny, sometimes sad, always engrossing, with much to say on the subject of the media and the shallowness of celebrity culture. As 'Chance', Sellers is magnificent, turning in his best performance in years. Listen carefully to his voice and you can plainly hear the influence of Stan Laurel. That he lost the 'Best Actor' Oscar to Dustin Hoffman for 'Kramer Vs. Kramer' beggars belief. Of the classy supporting cast, Douglas and Maclaine stand out, along with Jack Warden as the President. The scene in which Chance weeps as Ben dies is incredibly moving. Director Hal Ashby was also responsible for the brilliant black comedy 'Harold & Maude' ( 1971 ). He wrings every drop of humour and pathos out of this wonderfully understated film. The final scene has attracted much comment down the years, not all of it complementary. I think it rounds off the film splendidly, and is another reason why this should have been Sellers' final movie.Kosinski was, alas, a troubled genius. In 1991, he took his own life.",

His new-found popularity leads to talk-show appearances, insider parties, book publisher advances, and even an offer to become a presidential candidate.The film ends with a beautiful final shot, but undermines the moment by including a \"blooper reel\" immediately afterwards (this undermining is also precisely the director's point). A tasteless sex scene during the film's final act also jars uncomfortably with the rest of the film's tone.\"Being There\" was directed by the underrated, inimitable Hal Ashby (\"The Last Detail\", \"Harold and Maude\") and features some fine acting by Peter Sellers. Ashby lays the symbolism on thick (his name is CHANCE, his life as random as a coin toss), but the film's overall tone is one of quirky, light comedy, so such things work. Chance is himself a baffling figure. He's always \"being there\", forever \"in the right place at the right time\", but Ashby doesn't make it clear whether Chance is really a figure of powerful, perhaps even trans-formative innocence, or rather a figure of ridicule. The film's final shot challenges us to view Chance as a demi-God, but many of its passages are also preoccupied with the notion that celebrity, status and wealth in America are not based on depth, but on visibility, accessibility, personality, psychoses and outright stupidity. Appearances, then, are of more importance than substance.Elsewhere, Chance's statements and monologues are repeatedly misinterpreted by various characters. Significantly, how characters interpret Chance's words are intimately dependent upon their personalities, jobs and contextual frameworks. For example, Chance is a gardener and is always speaking about gardening, yet bankers or politicians continually interpret his words as economic allegories. The film thus critiques a very postmodern stance on meaning - meaning is relative, subjectively informed etc - and mocks man's desire to seek wisdom and inspiration to the point of imposing metaphoric meaning and symbolism upon what may or may not be nonsense. German philosopher Martin Heidegger's term \"dasein\", which translates as \"being-there\", may itself be an influence on the film's title. For Heidegger, \"dasein\" was a sort of self-reflexive, high state of awareness. Chance, though, might be said to be the opposite of this; he is \"anti reason\", he turns his back to western philosophy, and is instead a figure of supreme irrationalism. This, of course, is a direct contrast to the hero of another Ashby film, \"Bound for Glory\".8.5/10 - Worth one viewing.",

            "content": "During the late 70's and early eighties Hollywood decided to poke fun at the rich and affluent. In Being There it has never been done more appreciably. Having a simple mentally impaired gardener leave home, impeccably dressed, very proper and distinguished looking is anticipatively hilarious. Peter Sellers' performance is absolutely ingenious. He doesn't play for laughs, but instead is totally deadpan and serious. I have to say that this approach was completely correct on his part. The humor is much more interesting this way. Although this can be perceived as an unhappy film about a simpleton being exploited by the media due to their own ignorance, Being There left me with an odd feeling of bittersweet dismay.What I thought was most interesting was how Chance (Sellers) affected those around him and how they were drawn to his innocence and seeming wisdom.Being There is definitely a subject that predates work from Forrest Gump and the jokes are played in a similar fashion. Both movies make political cross-references as well which was their underlying intention. I will not criticize Forrest Gump for ripping off Being There, but I do believe Sellers performance nails the idea and character more accurately than tom Hanks' performance.I first saw this flick with my parents in the theater when I was about 12. Obviously most of this was over my head, since the themes are very adult and of a lofty intellectual nature, but I was still amused in my own way. I thought Chance was such a funny and tragic character that I couldn't help but embrace his vulnerability. If a child can perceive this concept then maybe this movie can be for young and old alike.",

The film has some deeper things to say about society, but on a strictly surface level it also has much to offer. The film has moments that are laugh-out-loud funny, as well as some that are just amusing in a very subtle way. In the best performance of his career, Peter Sellers is radiant and charming in a role very atypical of his repertoire. The music in the film is effective, and the script is simply brilliant, presenting a fish-out-of-water tale of a different type which leaves much to think about. The details of the main character's past and what goes on in his mind is kept secret, which is a tad frustrating, but it does add to the aura of mysteriousness that makes the character so intriguing. The only negative thing that stands out about the film is the goofs that are played over the end credits, spoiling the mood.

            "content": "I can't wait to rewatch this 1979 movie in a big theater, once again. It's one of my favorite movies of all time. Nevertheless, if you can't see this movie directed by Hal Ashby at the Cinema. It's a film worth watching at home. It's very entertaining. For those who don't know, what this movie is about. It is a great political satire about the media circus that comes with American Politics, told through a simple-minded, sheltered gardener named Chance (Peter Sellers) whom becomes an unlikely trusted adviser to a powerful businessman and an insider in Washington politics. Without spoiling the movie, too much, I have to say, what separates the plot of 'Being There' from the other misunderstanding screwball-comedies is the decidedly smart direction in which, they had everybody that surround Chance, being fool. Chance's well placid bearing, his manners, the soft-spoken and guileless manner of his speech, and the blandness of his personality, appeal to the image-obsessed upper-crust blue bloods around him so much, that they're so asinine obliviousness to the fact, that he doesn't know, anything about politics. Of course, since Chance is mentally-challenged, and does not understand the bulk of what's going on, around him; he does not challenge or correct anyone's misapprehension of him. He just goes with the flow. At no point does Chance intentionally mislead anyone. He just trying to live a simple life. It's like the 1970's version of 1994's film, 'Forrest Gump'. However, this film is not as cynical as that movie, nor the book of the same name in which this film was based on, by writer Jerzy Kosinski. While, the Konsinski's book has the over the top bourgeoisies as more cartoony stereotypes of decadence and degeneracy politicians. This film goes the other route, by making Chance extremely lucky in meeting somewhat likable realistic flesh out characters who happens to be gullible. There is nothing really too sinister about the people that surround Chance in this movie. That's why this movie is so likable. It's more realistic and easier to digest, because it's not so pessimistic. Regardless of the original tone, actor Peter Sellers was particularly touched by this successful satire story; that he heavily plead to Hollywood to play the titular character even if his career by the late 1970s has hit rock bottom and no studio in Hollywood would work with him. He was so determined to play the role in a film that he waited for seven years for the film to get off the ground. It wasn't until the success and revival of the Pink Panther series, that Lorimar Pictures finally greenlit the project. For the most part, the wait was worth it, as I really can't picture anybody else in the role. Sellers was amazing. He put a lot of work, into it: such as recording his voice over and over again, experimenting with different styles and tones. He chose a deliberately blank style to convey the character. From what I can get from the film, I think Sellers and the filmmakers were trying to pull, a 'what-if' scenario of a biblical Adam-like character, untouched by the original sin, having to live, outside the Garden of Eden, while still, dealing with his relationship with Eve. However, the way everyone felt good about themselves when he was around and the pure innocence he possessed shows that he was full of good intentions, makes him, seem more like Jesus or any other heavenly body. Hints the odd, out of context twist ending. Nevertheless, I just glad they didn't go with the original look for Chance; a graying overweight stereotypical Yahweh or Santa Claus type being. Not only was it, not good for Sellers because of his chronic and worsening heart problems, but it would be, a little too jarring; if they went with that, seeing how they made it look like the unseen Old Man in the beginning could be God. In the end, all of this heavenly body talk could be for nothing, or it could be too esoteric for us, common folks to understand. Regardless, I thought the supporting cast of this film that includes Shirley MacLaine, Richard Dysart, & Jack Warden was just as great. Also, Melvyn Douglas deserve the Supporting Actor Oscar win for his role as Benjamin Rayd. He was wonderful. I also love how well the movie was shot and how sparingly the locations were used. A good example is how they introduce the Washington D.C settling. You would never knew, where you're at, until you left the garden. It gives you, the same viewpoint as Chance got, that catapult him up the political ladder after years of isolation. However, the movie does have some faults. I really didn't like the soundtrack of this film. There was barely any original harmony and what little music, they used, didn't fit with the tone of the film. I don't get the Eumir Deodato jazz/funk arrangement of the opening fanfare from Sprach Zarathustra by Richard Strauss. It sound too bizarre. Another thing that kinda hurts the film is the end credits bloopers. Seeing footage of Sellers's constantly breaking down laughing during a monologue that was ultimately cut from the film, probably indeed cost him the Oscar. Sellers also agree with me, as he thought this was a violation of the movie's tone and tried to have them removed. It was awful. Overall: If life is a state of mind. Then, 'Being There' was a great dream. A must-watch. Highly recommended. Plant it and let it grow on you.",

            "content": "Although any number of people have compared Being There to Forrest Gump and the similarities are obvious, I like to think of Peter Sellers as Chance the Gardener as a whole lot like Jim Carrey's Truman Burbank in The Truman Show. Both come from very self contained universe, but whereas Carrey realizes that there is something out there beyond the reality his futuristic television show has provided and seeks to escape. Sellers however has come from a universe whose boundaries are that of the house he's been brought up in and when he's forced into the real world by as much chance as his name indicates he brings the real world and envelops it into his own reality.Back then people didn't understand autism and it wasn't talked about a whole lot. In that sense Hal Ashby's Being There was a ground breaking film as much as Forrest Gump was 16 years later. Chance is a 40 to 50 something man who was raised in comfortable circumstances by someone only identified as 'the old man'. Never being outside the grounds of the estate his reality consists of only two things, what he learns on television and the tasks he performs tending the garden on the grounds of the estate.He can't quite comprehend when 'the old man' dies and the estate is shut down and the house put up for sale. When yuppies David Clennon and Denise DuBarry move in and tell him he has to leave he just dutifully packs and takes to the mean streets of the nation's capital.By as much chance as his name indicates he has a run in with a limousine that power couple Melvyn Douglas and Shirley MacLaine who take the slightly injured man to their palatial estate which has enough grounds to keep any gardener busy. In trying to communicate with Sellers, he morphs into Chauncey Gardiner and his simple gardening aphorisms are taken as profound wisdom. Even the President of the United States, Jack Warden is impressed.Being There is based on a Jerzy Kosinski novel and the characters that Melvyn Douglas and Shirley MacLaine are based on are unmistakeably W. Averill Harriman and his third wife Pamela Harriman who were both power brokers behind the scenes in the Democratic Party. Douglas says that he's never sought public office and Harriman broke that rule only once in a less than impressive term as Governor of New York. He was far more at home with presidential appointments to various posts and serving as a senior adviser to Democratic presidents Kennedy, Johnson, and Carter. Roosevelt and Truman were his seniors. His wife Pamela, his third wife was the widow of Randolph Churchill and a noted party giver where the high and mighty in Democratic governments mixed politics with cocktails.Douglas got a second Best Supporting Actor Oscar for Being There to match the one he got for Hud. Peter Sellers got Being There's only other Oscar recognition, a nomination for Best Actor which he lost to Dustin Hoffman for Kramer Vs. Kramer. Oddly enough neither the film or Hal Ashby's direction didn't get recognized.The only guy who puts it all together is Richard Dysart as Melvyn Douglas's doctor who gives a very rueful performance indeed.As for Chance the Gardener or Chauncey Gardener you have to see Being There to see what chance has in store for Chance.",

            "content": "Long before Forrest Gump there was another simple man who changed the world he lived in. Not by design of course but by simply being there. Written by Jerzy Kozinski from his own novel and beautifully directed by Hal Ashby \"Being There\" tells the story of Chance, a simpleton gardener who has never been allowed out of the house in which he has lived in and worked for all his life. When the \"old man\" who owns the house passes away, Chance is then forced to leave and face the outside world where his innocence and simplicity are mistaken for financial savvy and wisdom with a penchant for gardening metaphors.Hal Ashby, one of the most underestimated director of the New Hollywood period delivered in its tail end (1979) this little gem which I watched, caught between bouts of laughter and consternation; each and every single cringe induced not by Chance but the inability of the people who meet him to see the man for what he truly is. Chance never claims (quite literally) to be anything is not and only people's assumptions propel this film from one absurdity to the next, and in the midst of all this, Chance strolls along, innocent, detached and somewhat weightless, to a quiet conclusion where the world keeps on guessing and plotting.And so, Hal Ashby pokes gentle fun at the establishment through his characters' delusions and, for some, the frenzy they get themselves into but he and Kozinski never let any political stance overshadow a story which in nature is both heart-warming and melancholic. What the film boils down to is however jaded and so-called sophisticated people are, in their heart of hardened hearts, they all are ultimately attracted, in some way or the other, to the simplicity, the kindness and the innocence of Chance the gardener.Needless to say Peter Sellers' performance is absolutely incredible given the fact that it is so subdued, delicate and seemingly effortless. This was his last performance and it is truly the stuff of legend. Shirley McLaine is equally amazing in her comedic timing as a wife soon to be widow finding solace and romance in Chance's soft approach to life in general.In the end, this is both an emotional comedy and a light-hearted drama. This defies labels. This is a work of sheer brilliance from Hal Ashby, and an astounding conclusion to Peter Sellers' incredible career.",

However, \"Being There\" is my favorite movie ever.There isn't much I can say that hasn't been said before about this movie. But here we go...Peter Sellers' performance as Chance the gardener is truly a master at work. We see Tom Hanks and Dustin Hoffman do their performances as simpletons and mentally handicapped persons and they just seem like cartoon characters. Sellers' Chance is a perfect performance, balancing Chance's wonder, confusion and ignorance without ever making a cheap or obvious joke. His timing, his facial expressions and his moments of silence maintains a wonderful and memorable character that never loses his substance. Sellers keeps his game face of near blankness without ever collapsing into cinematic clich\u00e9s in this area.I have read a few reviews of this film and I am always amazed that no one ever mentions the tears in Chance's eyes when Ben passes. Am I dreaming when I see them? Tears in his eyes is a hint that Chance is growing; that, since the passing of \"the old man\" where Chance was literally numb to grief, he suddenly is struck with emotion. God I love that.Peter Sellers and Shirley McClain(sp?) together on screen remains one of the most beautiful on-screen couples I think. The class, the sensuality and the simple beauty between them makes them so very charming. Even with Sellers' failing health they both look very beautiful together.And the ending. Again, many different ideas on what it means, if anything. Personally...I think it shows that Chance is not subject to many things in this life just because of his isolation from so much of it and his simple ignorance to these very basic realities. Maybe it just shows that he is a kind heart and nothing can defeat him? I dunno.I have tried to write something a little different here on my first review. Maybe I'll get better at it eventually.",

Like Stanley Kubrick's Dr. Strangelove, Being There can be perceived as prophetic for its sociopolitical outlook. The conclusion at the ending is so mind-boggling it defies rational explanation.  It is tragic and criminal Peter Sellers never won a Best Actor Oscar for his astonishing tour-de-force performance as a simple-minded gardener going through the most bizarre and hilarious happenings imaginable. Director Hal Ashby and Screenwriter/Novelist Jerzy Kosinski deserve acclaims for producing the masterpiece of satire and comedic subtlety that the master satirist author of Gulliver's Travels and A Modern Proposal Jonathan Swift could have appreciated. The whole Oscar competition is wholly unfair and utterly biased, as George C. Scott - the great actor who delivered the blistering performance as a protagonist in Patton - once denounced the competition as \"meat parade\". Bless Sellers and Scott for contributing to some of the best male performances ever captured on film. Even some of the best films did not receive prestigious awards like Citizen Kane, but Being There is one of the true film classics that must live on, forever etched into our memory of moviegoing experience. Yet Being There resides in the comedy section of most video shops, ignored and seldomly rented until a curious person sees the strange front cover artwork of a man in the suit walking in the air on video box and decides to give it a try only to be rewarded with the rarest and most compelling moviewatching experience he or she have had and pass the raving word of mouth to relatives, friends and co-workers. Gratitude isn't enough. Watching Being There alone should restore the faith in movies that there is indeed something good in top-notch quality filmmaking if executed right. It's beyond imagination that Hollywood would make another movie as masterful in terms of deliberately slow-pace, subtle and understated drama and/or comedy as Being There but I could make exception for Wes Anderson of Rushmore and The Royal Tenenbaums.    \nBefore there was Forrest Gump, there was Chance the Gardener.\"I like to watch.\"",

            "content": "Okay, let's face it. In the real world, Chance the Gardener would not have lasted very long walking around in the heart of D.C. looking for some kind black lady to make him lunch. Even if he made it past the street gangs, he would have been figured out as a simpleton in a millisecond by rich billionaire Ben Rand, if not by his doctor or butler. Chance's words about caring for the garden of the American economy would not have made it past the first commercial break of \"The Gary Burns Show.\" The contrived nature of \"Being There\" works only when you see it as a fable rather than as cinema verite. But then, then it works with an almost perfect splendor.The only way to begin an appreciation of this film is with Peter Sellers. He had an amazing film career, amazing in that he created such a comic gold standard (the best of the sound era, I think it can be safely said) without having very many great or even very good films to his credit. Sellers was funny, and he was gifted, but only rarely did it come together in a way that radiated the magic he was capable of. Here, in what literally turned out to be the last months of his life, and in obviously frail health, he turned in a performance that stands with the dozen greatest screen performances ever. He plays a slow-witted character who is completely dead to the nuances of life around him, and by being so, brings life to those who are otherwise left to wither at the vine. He revives the spirits of aging plutocrat Melvyn Douglas, and \"uncoils\" Shirley MacLaine, but sadly, feels none of those stirrings for himself. He is truly God's fool in that the grace he brings is completely outside himself, and as we look into his placid, friendly, unknowing face, we feel a sadness that's hard to describe. Maybe it has to do with the short life Sellers had left to him when this film was made. But this film would pack much the same punch if Sellers was with us still. He never plays it for pathos, just for laughs, but what we are left with is more than a bit of both.What else is it about \"Being There\" that makes it special? I think it comes down to tone. The tone of the film is not that of a laugh-out-loud comedy. It tries to be funny, and succeeds, in ways that standard dramas do not. Hal Ashby manages a feat of control here that's almost fearsome. He maintains the sad, minor-key aura (a silent-movie score) that lends the film its strength and sinew. You can hear it in the music, the way the lilting classic strains of piano and harp joins with the cold white chill that comes through the windowpanes in casting an almost sepulchral feeling to the proceedings, yet it never feels deadly or morbid. We are always made aware of the life around us.Another thing: The film really is funny. It only works when you suspend disbelief and realize you are not watching \"All The President's Men,\" but when you do, the film takes on a real humor. The tone is never jovial, but it has laughs, snickers, and a pervasive geniality that inspires all the more when you realize how much of the movie is about death and loss.Of all the credits, one deserving special attention is that of Dianne Schroeder, who apparently found all the then-contemporary TV bits to weave into the narrative. Throughout the film, we are treated to a Greek chorus of ephemeric commercials and news clips that all neatly dovetail to the action in the story, nowhere more so then early on, when Chance gets the news of the Old Man's passing as some unnamed character consoles Sesame Street's Big Bird with the lilting, tender jingle \"Sugar And Spice.\" And how about that seduction scene played out while Mr. Rogers discusses \"friendship\" with Mr. McFeeley? \"Basketball Jones\" almost brings a sob to one's throat as we watch Chance's entrance to the Rand Estate. Cheech and Chong's finest screen moment, undoubtedly.Ultimately, it all comes back to Sellers. What a triumph. That last image of him on the pond is indelible. Maybe sticking in those blooper bits at the end cost him the Oscar to Dustin Hoffman in \"Kramer Vs. Kramer\" (that and all the divorced fathers who were voting members in the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences in 1980), but it is such a tribute to his level of genius, and his sense of fun, to have that as a wrapper for what was a career we will never see the likes of again. I'll take it over an Oscar; hell, Sellers has been dead more than 20 years, his winning or not winning an Oscar stopped being important decades ago, but his chortling failure at passing on Raphael's message will remain something to be enjoyed long after you and I join Peter and Melvyn in that \"big room upstairs.\"",

            "content": "Many previous reviewers have compared Chance the Gardener with Forrest Gump. This I can hardly understand. Whereas Forrest Gump is the eternal dimwitted boy who bumbles through a world populated by basically well meaning people, Being There has an adult theme with a really dark side.Nobody can really tell how stupid Chance actually is. Nobody knows what lurks under the calm surface of a stately gentleman. Nobody knows if there's a will and, if there is, where it is directed to. From the time Chance is dusting the flat tire of a old limousine the first five minutes into the movie, the viewer knows that there is something seriously wrong. This man is not from outer space, he has a story and it is hinted that it is a sinister one. Chance himself at one time points out quite clearly: I was not allowed to go out. So one can assume that there at least once was a will which met obstacles. Chance\u0091s emerging into the open is reminiscent of the story of Kaspar Hauser, a young man who suddenly turned up on a street in Germany in the 19th century. He was unable to speak and seemed to have had no social contacts at all. It was hinted that he was the heir of one of Germany\u0091s numerous principalities and was kept in hiding for political reasons.Who else but Peter Sellers could have played Chance the Gardener? I could not think of anyone. He really succeeded wonderfully in fusing the aspects of comedy with those of tragedy, his manner of speaking seemed to me just perfect. He makes a person out of a non-person which in itself is a kind of a miracle. His at the same time funny and very moving performance is unforgettable. Please watch the end credits!As I come to think of it, this kind of multi-layered adult big budget movie is hardly made any more in the Post Spielberg era. Have we all reverted to teenagers?",

            "content": "*SPOILER ALERT*The late Hal Ashby had a brilliant creative run as a director through the 1970s - and BEING THERE was a decade-ending peak before the unfortunate career tailspin seen in his early-80s work and his 1988 death from cancer. Starring Peter Sellers and Shirley Maclaine, this sublime philosophical satire essentially centers around Chance the gardener (Sellers), a mentally handicapped man who knows only gardening and what he watches on TV. He is inadvertently thought to be a genius when he accidentally stumbles into political fame - his very honest and simple responses to what he sees (or to any of the oft-amusing conversations he ends up having) are interpreted by the self-absorbed 'important' people around him as brilliance - Zen-like aphorisms. The film's title is a play on this - Chance (he somehow becomes Chauncey Gardner amid the myriad other misinterpretations) seems to be, in the Buddhist sense - living in the moment; so utterly unlike everyone else he encounters, and the very last scene (perhaps my favorite ever movie scene) visually drives the point home with great finality - and an interesting, sudden Judeo-Christian spin, as the (heard at this point in voice-over) eulogy being delivered by the president (Jack Warden) ends with a great, deadpan final line: 'Life . is a state of mind.' The ultimately agnostic sense of spirituality running through the film makes up the fascinating center of BEING THERE. However, director Hal Ashby was also an utter pragmatist, and the continual contrast between ethereal spirituality and cut-the-crap bluntness provides the edge that keeps this film (along with Ashby's earlier, and thematically similar, HAROLD & MAUDE, SHAMPOO and THE LAST DETAIL) from ever seeming like a dilettante's mystical goop. Intercut bits of the television Chance is obsessed with function as the viewer's route into the sharp, relentless and oft-dark social commentary that tugs like an undertow beneath the wispy and dreamlike surface. Thus BEING THERE is - at once - a magical fable, and a skillfully weaved series of bleak but amusing observations of social hierarchies, electoral politics (the funeral scene that concludes the film in particular seems to foreshadow the Reagan era with an eerie level of precision), and fame, and not a shot of this perfectly conceived film rings false.",

            "content": "First of all, I would like to say that this is my first time reviewing a movie here on IMDb, so please excuse me for any spelling mistakes, since i'm still learning English. Now let's talk about the movie.This movie tells the story of a man named Chance (Petter Sellers), a gardener that never got out of his boss' house, an old man. All Chance does all day is to watch TV and mimics whatever is on Television. But when the old man dies, he's forced to leave the house for the first time in his life, and that's when he meets Shirley Maclaine's character. I'm not gonna say more to don't spoil the movie, but that's basically the story. It is, indeed, very simple, but it made me think about my whole life, since all I do all day is to stay home and watch television. The writing in this movie is very good, the way the character's develop and the development of the whole story is made in a beautiful way. Though the story doesn't make a lot of a sense and looks a lot like Forrest Gump (dumb guy who becomes a celebrity without been aware of it), the movie is written in a way that you are led to believe that this could've happened. I never cried in a movie, but I almost did with this one, what says a lot about how powerful this screenplay is.But this plot wouldn't work without the incredible acting the movie has got. All the supporting actors do a great job, no one is miscast or feels out of place. Melvyn Douglas does a great job as the main supporting actor (and even won an Oscar for it), and Shirley Maclaine is also nice, but the main force that drives the movie is the main actor, Peter Sellers. This is probably one of the best roles in his career - and he portrayed Chance with perfection. It' s a shame that he didn't got the Oscar for it (Dustin Hoffman won for Kramer vs. Kramer instead), but who cares about a stupid little golden man? What matters here is the dedication that Sellers gave to the character - ten years of preparation to be exact.The direction here doesn't really stands out, since this movie is all about the writing and acting. The cinematography also is quite regular, except for the final scene, a beautiful work of photography. The soundtrack was great also, with an original music score made by Johnny Mandel, with a nice orchestra.But it's not all flowers. Two things REALLY bothered me, and that's why the movie doesn't deserve a perfect score. The first one is the song that plays when Chance gets out of the old man's house. I couldn't really understand what was up with the 2001 main theme remix. But i could get past that. The final scene also didn't make much sense, but there can be a meaning for it. But what got into my nerves was the ending credits. The deleted scene felt completely out of place and destroyed all that the movie tried (and succeeded) to accomplish - a sad ending and a touching movie.Overral, this is a great movie, with a very strong message and perfect acting. A must-see for any Peter Sellers fan - and any movie fan in generalA very deserved 9 out of 10.",

His simple TV-informed utterances are mistaken for profundity.Peter Sellers is both lovable and annoying, but in the most perfect way. He stumbles along, innocent, with everyone finding deep meaning where there is none. As an outside viewer, I find this frustrating and want to slap him upside the head. He speaks in a choppy, childish manner. But this was the part, and while I may not like Chance, I think Sellers soars.And I never get enough of Melvyn Douglas. Never. I need more of him in my life. He seems to be typecast as the wealthy elder (at least in his later years). But he nails that role, so I cannot complain. Shirley MacLaine is also great... as always. The grandpa from \"Problem Child\" is here, too, in his best role ever.The inclusion of such television staples as Basketball Jones, Mister Rogers, Price is Right and more really fleshes out the film. What does it say about children raised on television? I am not sure, maybe nothing. Chance is rare case, of someone who knows nothing else. I believe that a real person would fare better in the real world than they show Chance doing, though he is also rather stupid. So, it would be hard to decide.The film is something of a precursor to \"Forrest Gump\", in that a foolish man just happens to be in the right places (\"being there\") at the right time. How they managed to get a PG with all the foul language is beyond me, but I suspect it was because this predates the PG-13 rating and is not nearly rough enough for an R.By far my favorite part was watching the government scramble to find out more on Chauncey Gardiner.

            "content": "I enjoyed the book thoroughly.  I highly recommend it; a gem.When I first saw the movie about 10 years ago, I didn't care for it; perhaps an attitude problem (\"not as good as the book\"), perhaps the fact that other persons in the room viewing the film were offended by the sex (or sex reference) scenes, and insisted on fast-forwarding over them.  This made the movie hard to watch, as you were always constantly filtering on behalf of the sensibilities of others with your itchy finger on the remote.But on my recent reviewing, I was enchanted.  This movie captures the book's central idea...or should I say \"myth\"?  Chance the Gardener is certainly a character of mythic dimensions, and the movie would have failed if it didn't deliver on this point.  I admired the screenplay, and enjoyed the life the actors breathed into it.*** Spoiler, though a minor one...  ***My only nit to pick; didn't like the \"walk on water\" image at the very end; it sort of reminds me of the scene at the end of \"Harvey\" where the door is opened and closed by the hand of the invisible rabbit friend.  Scenes like this \"give in\" to the idea that the viewers can't be expected to bridge these gaps of imagination and fantasy by themselves, and need these kinds of prosthetic stage devises.  Fie on't!But that's a minor complaint.  I watched this movie with some ESL students, and one young Chinese lady in particular appreciated the relatively easy-to-follow English--lines delivered slowly and evenly--and picked up just fine on the central irony of the story.  And you will, too:  Watch this movie.  Or maybe just read the book....",

Sellers plays Chance, a British gardener that has a very simple perception of everything, nothing is more important to him that plants. After the owner of the place where he worked dies, Chance leaves and casually bumps as an honor guest in a high class family. From then on, Chance passes to be a simple honor guest to a candidate for president, just for what he says.For example, in a scene where they are having dinner, the owner of the house asks Sellers if he likes his life routine in the house, he answers that he likes \"the room upstairs, that he really likes going to that room and rest\" The owner, who is dying of cancer says \"yeah, I would like to go to that room too\" While the owner refers and thinks Chance refers to the room as dead, Sellers is ACTUALLY talking about the room upstairs the house, his perception is so simple he says things many could take as a symbol, yet he says it with full honesty.Being There is a tale about how in complication, a man can just see the things, as everyone is always worried, Chance is there",

A man who is mentally retarded is mistaken by everyone he meets as being important, wise, clever, funny, romantic, etc., depending on the circumstances. But this one joke is not funny, not even in the first instance. In fact, it is irritating.And it is still worse. Not only are there people out there who think this movie is funny, but many of them also think that it tells us something profound about human nature. But the human nature in this movie has no connection to reality. It is obvious to us from the very beginning that Chance is a simpleton, and that means everyone else in the movie has to be something of a simpleton too not to realize it.And because the movie hits us over the head by having Chance walk on water, I guess we are supposed to discern a spiritual message as well.

The story of a simple minded gardener who is mistaken by those he meets as a guru gets rung through the ringer a little too much, but the performances and screenplay save it from itself. Especially good is the opening fifteen minutes or so when he's evicted from the dilapidated house with a walled garden that he's lived in for most of his life, and wanders through the streets accompanied by the jazzed up 2001 A Space Odyssey soundtrack that was popular at the time. Coming out in 1979, a period of malaise, rising gas prices, and stagflation, it captured the mood of a public rapidly losing its faith in politics and government, which a little later would set the stage for the Reagan years. Yearning for answers, both the public and the elite naively hone in on him while Shirley MacLaine tries her best to seduce him. With a strong performance by Richard Dysart as the skeptical physician, and a very funny scene at a dinner for a Russian ambassador played by Richard Basehart, the film is still almost sadder than it is funny, due mostly to Sellers performance, his last movie, the end of an era both for him and for the Great Society politics of the 60's.",

            "review_title": "\"We must take care of our garden\"...",
            "content": "That was the final quote from Voltaire's satirical essay about optimism: \"Candide\". No matter the adversities, preoccupations or struggles, tending one's garden was the epitome of wisdom. And that came from Candide who used to believe that \"everything is for the best in this best of all possible worlds.\"\"Being There\" is a satire that goes the reverse way, starting with a man who tends his garden and then grows with his roses and plants an optimism everyone perceives but him. The man is Chance the gardener, one of the greatest movie characters ever and unlike many others, he doesn't seem to have an arc.As far back as he can remember, Chance, has lived in his master's big estate house and never left it. His whole life had been dedicated to (and defined by) two activities: gardening (the only thing he's actually competent at) and watching TV (his \"I like to watch\" referring to TV is more than a motto, it's an understatement). The man's vision of life has been completely shaped by the little screen and its continuous avalanche of images flooding day and night\"from cartoons to ads, soap operas to movies, new and old.Chance the gardener devours what comes from that box with an appetite that makes you wonder whether he would have blown out of exhaustion today. But when the film starts, all we see is a mild-mannered well-dressed middle-aged man. There's no suspicion raised about his mental state... until the maid comes and announces that the \"old man\" is dead. Chance's doesn't shed a tear for his boss' passing, he's a child in a man's body, speaking in a rather limited vocabulary but articulate enough to give him the benefit of doubt.Actually, we're the first to be fooled by his appearance and this sets the tone of Hal Ashby's masterpiece \"Being There\", one of the most brilliant comedies ever made... or is it an intelligent movie that just happens to be funny, because it works on the simple premise of \"irony\", it's all about contrasts. If Chance doesn't fool little people, his good manners and his well-spoken attitude seem to imply some upper class WASP upbringing and earn him the respect of the whole Washington establishment, including an influent dying businessman and adviser of the President (Melvyn Douglas).Chance even meets the President (Jack Warden) who ends up \"understanding\" his babbling about growth, plants and seasons. Chance's words are then quoted by the White House occupants and one thing leading to another, he becomes a star. Before one makes an easy comparison, the film actually works in a different way than \"Forrest Gump\". Gump knew he was limited and everyone did, yet from his actions he managed to earn everyone's respect and admiration. Chance isn't an impostor because he doesn't pretend to be anything else than a gardener but it would be so baffling for the upper class to see an idiot in this man that any statement, any platitude is mistaken for profundity. Even Chance the Gardener is confused with the snobbish-sounding Chauncey Gardener.Now, in a lesser film, the wonderful premise of \"Being There\" would have been turned into some cheap gimmick, but the film elevates it to a level of quiet sophistication, as Chance's ascension reveals the degeneracy and decadence of the civilized world, something echoed in a French film that said \"out of a misunderstanding, anything can work\". The script based on Jerzi Kozinski's novel and screenplay is a biting satire \u00e0 la \"Network\" commenting on the rise of an era of mediocrity where people are so demanding of models they would adopt any good communicant as a new prophet.The little edge of \"Being There\" is that it's moving, it's also a film that showcases many aspects of Chances' life, his isolation from the rest of the world (suggested by classical melancholy), his vulnerability and childlike kindness like that moment where he he's cornered by a gang of street kids and tries to get rid of them by pressing the remote control like a magic wand. At the end of the film, he's the one basking in his own normality while the others are decrypting every word or sentence he says, using a symbolic remote control called \"sociocentrism\".This is summed up in an underrated moment where the old maid laments about society being a place for the white guy since a simpleton like Chance can pass as a genius. She's not that wrong and her comment could be extrapolated to today's reality TV where models are manufactured out of sheer nothingness, oly communicated with style. Indeed, Chance can speak of \"growth\", \"garden\" saying he likes to watch or simply \"I understand\" and everyone else will do the figuring... projecting their own desires and perceptions in him. Chance is first like a sponge impregnated with all the images of the world from TV, at the end he becomes a mirror where everyone perceives his own ideal.Sellers who said he had no personality once he stopped playing, was the perfect actor for such a film, it is his penultimate role but quite a performance, one that demands an exactitude within that seemingly one-note tone. And in the many scenes involving the growing friendship between Douglas and Sellers, you could see that there was genuine emotion from \"Chauncey\" as if even this encounter with other people could affect him. Hal Ashby was a director of true originality, here he provides an existential masterpiece and the perfect epitaph for a comic legend.I still give it a 9 because of the useless part involving the President's sex life, distracting from the other romantic subplot involving Shirley MacLaine and for the infamous bloopers sequences. I hate bloopers even for Jim Carrey comedies let alone a film of such depth and humanity, with a perfect image and the perfect quote. Whatever 'state of mind' inspired this move... there's one of Chance's catchphrases I'll never use.",

She's gyrating in every imaginable orgasmic way while the asexual gardener watches the world (instead of her) the only way he knows how: on television.The problem is, the gentleman of the house has deceased. This means that Sellers will have to leave and face a world he doesn't know.Given that MacLaine usually plays quite extroverted and hilarious characters and Sellers usually played understated and bumblingly hilarious characters, mixing the two of them in \"Being There\" became a smash hit.

Injured after an automobile accident and with nothing to fall back on but aphorisms learned, or just picked up, from decades of watching television, he is 'rescued' by Shirley MacLaine and her ancient husband Melvyn Douglas and is somehow mistaken for something of a seer by his new-found friends and even by the American President, (Jack Warden).Adapted by Jerzy Kosinski from his own novel, \"Being There\" is Hal Ashby's masterpiece and remains one of the key American films of the seventies. Very funny and deeply insightful and bolstered by Sellers' extraordinary performance it went to places other American films with a political edge simply didn't go to in those days and above all it treated Sellers' character with a great deal more than just compassion; both the film and Sellers gave Chance grace notes.

The characters' long hair and double-breasted suits also attest to an era that to modern viewers might be seen to lack style.Yet despite the settings, the basic thrust of Hal Ashby's classic comedy remains as significant today as it did nearly forty years ago. Chance the gardener (Peter Sellers) is very much the innocent abroad; the servant forcibly removed from his childhood home trying to make his way in a hostile world. It is his good fortune that he should fetch up at Eve Rand's (Shirley MacLaine's) mansion, and be offered a new home as a result. Sellers gives possibly his best characterization on film as the television-fixated gardener whose expression remains largely impassive yet oddly charming. Chance accepts everyone on their own terms; class and status do not matter. He addresses the President of the United States (Jack Warden) as \"Bob,\" being completely unaware of expected formal conventions. All he knows about is tending gardens, and he preaches that message with an enthusiasm and an ingenuousness that contrast with the more worldly speech-patterns of the other characters.The film offers director Ashby the chance to lampoon politicians and media buffs, all of whom willfully misinterpret Chance's words and regard him as something of a guru rather than a lowly gardener. There are strong echoes of other comedies such as Moliere's TARTUFFE in the way the chat-show host Gary Burns (Jerome Hellman) listens intently to Chance as if he were a great politician. The only difference, of course, is that whereas Tartuffe merely pretended to be a guru as a way of exploiting his social superiors, Chance is a true innocent.The ending is both poignant and unexpected, as Chance is seen, quite literally, to walk on water. He might not be very clever as his one-time protector Louise (Ruth Attaway) remarks, but his determination to enjoy the moment offers an example to us all.Director Hal Ashby fashions a brilliant film out of Jerzy Kosinski's novel. There is very little music to distract the viewers' attention, and Caleb Deschanel's lush photography captures the olde-worlde quality of the Rands' mansion. The director uses several establishing-shots to denote the world in which Chance operates; and is not frightened of using long takes focusing on the characters' relationship to their environment.BEING THERE is a modern classic; it is sad that the film won only won Oscar, and the fact that Sellers was deprived of a Best Actor award (by Dustin Hoffman in the mawkish KRAMER VS. KRAMER) demonstrates how myopic the American Academy of Arts and Sciences actually were.",

            "content": "Hal Ashby's \"Being There\", about a simple-minded gardener named Chance (Peter Sellers, in one of his last roles) is a fish-out-of-water tale to an extreme degree. Chance is a gardener for a wealthy man, until one morning when the old man dies. Attorneys come to the house to settle the estate, and find Chance, despite the fact that there is no record of him working at the house. Chance explains that he has lived at the house as long as he could remember, and has never left the house; wearing the old man's clothes, having his meals prepared by the housekeeper. The only outside contact with the world is his television, which he watches obsessively. The lawyers tell him he has to leave, so Chance sets out with no money, and a suitcase full of clothes. Being basically simple-minded (possibly autistic?) and not able to read or write, Chance walks around the city that night until he is accidentally hit by a limousine carrying Eve Rand (Shirley MacLaine). She invites him to her house to have his injuries looked at, where there are nurses and a doctor caring for her ailing, much older husband Benjamin (Melvyn Douglas) who is on his deathbed. Benjamin is an extremely wealthy retired businessman who has an ear with the President of the United States (Jack Warden), and he takes an immediate liking for Chance, who they think is named Chauncey Gardner. Eve and Benjamin take Chance under their wing, and suddenly his life goes into full gear within days, appearing on television shows, meeting the President, and being appointed to a government post \u0096 all because everyone thinks that he is someone he isn't.Obviously, \"Being There\" is a thought-inducing film. After watching the film, I was struck by its similarity to \"The King of Hearts\" in this sense. \"Being There\" is pretty straight forward when you watch it, but upon further reflection, it is so clear that, like \"King of Hearts\", that appearances can be deceiving. In \"Hearts\", war tears apart a French village, but the soldiers decide not to evacuate the mental institution. The patients get out, and begin to inhabit the village themselves. It seems that at face value, the patients are indeed insane, simply because society has deemed them so, but truly it becomes clear that they are not the insane ones, their surroundings are far more insane than they are. \"Being There\" invoked this memory of that film because while Chance is indeed simple-seeming, is it just that he's unblemished and not jaded from being in society for the first fifty-odd years of his life? And the fact that people judge Chance, thinking he has an agenda, etc. is simply them projecting their own issues and insecurities on him? All of this has probably been debated before, but hey, I just saw this for the first time.Sellers is spectacular (as usual), as is MacLaine, but I have to admit that I watched this film with a great deal of distress, because, like \"Edward Scissorhands\" for example, I don't find someone's innocence and naivet\u00e9 necessarily a laughing matter, particularly when they are put into a new and uncomfortable situation. Luckily, these matters were put to rest fairly early on in the film, or I'm sure that I wouldn't have enjoyed it as much. Mostly social commentary, somewhat a comedy, \"Being There\" is a good film that serves as a great reminder that Sellers was more than a comedic genius. 6/10",

            "content": "It takes a leap of faith to buy the pesky little plot device rattling around in \"Being There\". Peter Sellers is brilliantly controlled portraying a grown man with the intelligence of a seven-year-old who has worked all his life as a gardener for an elderly recluse, one who apparently took him in as a child but kept him from the outside world. After the old man dies and the house is taken over, Sellers' \"Chauncey Gardiner\" finds himself on his own for the very first time, but a trick of fate quickly puts him in the hands (and in the opulent home) of a powerful political couple. Chauncey has never ridden in a car, been to the doctor or the dentist--everything he knows apart from gardening comes from television, and television incarnate continually butts into the framework of this premise. Director Hal Ashby doesn't want us to miss anything, and so every ironic point is underlined with clips of inane TV commercials and programs (or, in one irritating case, an animated video that looks like the Harlem Globetrotters). Chauncey is accepted rather too easily into the home of Melvyn Douglas (Oscar winner for Best Supporting Actor) and his beaming, twittering wife (Shirley MacLaine, in great form); but, in order for this whole idea to work, the characters have to--at one point or another--behave rather unrealistically. The film rests on its polite, genteel outlandishness, yet Ashby seems to think he's scoring points against Washington, D.C. society, setting them up as fools, while also using his scenario as a microcosm for all America. Heady stuff for what is basically a satire of the shallowness at large in humanity. The baffling, amusing final shot leaves itself open to interpretation and, indeed, \"Being There\" has been debated by many resilient minds. Yet one must wonder if the picture warrants such serious examination. *** from ****",

It stars Peter Sellers in his last role of note, as mentally retarded gardener Chance, who occasionally utters what he heard on TV. After his employer dies, he wonders the city and eventually gets picked up by wealthy Ben Rand (Melvyn Douglas, who won Best Supporting Actor) and his wife Eve (Shirley MacLaine). As the movie progresses, two things become apparent: Chance's comments - which he himself doesn't really understand - get interpreted by everyone as deep philosophical statements, and the Rands are not really living as they want.If nothing else, this movie underscores how talented the three stars are, and what a great director Hal Ashby was (he also directed such greats as \"Harold and Maude\", \"The Last Detail\", \"Shampoo\", \"Bound for Glory\" and \"Coming Home\"). Peter Sellers is as keen here as he was as Insp. Clouseau or in \"Dr. Strangelove\". When Shirley MacLaine made her debut back in the '50s, who ever would have guessed that she would eventually, uh, play with herself in a movie? And Melvyn Douglas certainly deserved his Oscar.

            "content": "Unfortunately, not many in this generation have heard of Peter Sellers, especially since they are used to the bad acting from \"reality\" shows. While his apex was probably during \"Dr. Strangelove\" (playing 3 different characters), he was known for being the chameleon, even before David Bowie. That is why \"Being There\" is so interesting; Sellers plays an individual with no personality.Now this may sound paradoxical, but to play the a simpleton is no ordinary task; as Kirk Lazarus from \"Tropic Thunder\" said: \"Everybody knows you never go full retard\" (he even mentions \"Being There\"). And in a lesser actor's hands, that's where this movie would have gone. Sellers and Ashby take their time with making you be familiar with the character, which surprisingly takes only a few minutes.This is not to say that everyone else's performance was dismal. If anything, Melvyn Douglas as the Randian capitalist with a good heart comes out strong, and Shirley McClaine as his conflicted wife is entertaining. But the fact is that Sellers and Ashby are the glue that holds this film together.About comparisons to Forest Gump: I'm not going to say that \"Gump\" is a shameless rip-off, but the story sure borrows a lot from \"Being There\". Furthermore, \"Gump\" is more of a reminiscence film, with too many subtleties spelled out, and too long. Furthermore, while I admire Hanks as an actor as a whole, his performance as \"Gump\" is amateurish compared to Sellers--yes, I believe Sellers deserved the Oscar even over Hoffman in \"Kramer vs. Kramer\".Overall, an impressive film with masters of acting and directing giving a good, story with none of the fluff.

She says \"I was looking for you, Chance.\" He says \"I was looking for you too.\" They take hands and walk off together. But near the end of production, somebody went up to Hal and said \"How's it going?\" \"Great,\" Hal said. \"Sellers has created this character that's so amazing, I could have him walk on water and people would believe it.\" Hal stopped and thought. \"As a matter of fact, I will have him walk on water.\"Hal was out on location, miles from Hollywood. The last thing on earth he needed was to contact the home office to discuss the idea of Chance walking on water. It's an idea that wouldn't pitch or read well. If it had been in the script, there would have been endless arguments over what this Jesus allegory was doing in the picture. Only if you've actually seen the film do you realize that it's not a Jesus allegory at all. Chance can walk on water because nobody ever told him he couldn't, not because he's the resurrection of Christ. Hal knew he could make it work, just as he knew that there was no way in hell the studio would approve of more money for such a controversial shot that wasn't even in the script. He decided to do it anyway.First, he called Robert Downey, who had a scene in Greaser's Palace where the main character walked on water. Hal knew that Downey didn't have a lot of money, so he asked for advice on how to do it. Downey told him it was simple. Just go to an airport, get a certain kind of platform, and place it in the water. Hal followed Downey's advise and got the shot for less than $10,000. Second, he had to deal with keeping the shot a secret. There was this one, very well dressed kid around the set who was officially called a PA, but whom Hal suspected of being the studio spy. Hal called him into his office and read him the riot act. \"I'm going to ask you to make a decision right now that's going to affect the rest of your life,\" he told the kid. \"I'm going to ask you to decide whose side you're on. I know you've been watching me because you want to learn how to make movies. I also know you're watching me to make reports to the studio behind my back. I'm about to change the end of this movie because I've come up with a better one. The studio can't know about it or they'll shut me down. This is it, kid. Decide. Are you on the side of art or commerce?\" The kid kept his mouth shut. The shot got made. The studio was p****d but they used the shot anyway. Hal didn't give them a choice. He didn't even shoot the ending in the script.",

Whenever Gardner would utter out some desultory and obtuse phrases, he mesmerized a lot of prominent people, including world leaders, d\u00e9butantes, and even, the President of the United States! The philosophically visceral demeanor with which Chauncy Gardner exuded, became an insightfully widespread pr\u00e9cis of seemingly good fortune, as well as, an edict for attitudinal uplifting! Gardner's proclivity for watching 12 hours of television a day, and spewing out impossibly candid answers, manifested a personality which spurred on a pandemic reaction from the top rung of the Washington DC elite! While staying at the estate of a Washington DC mogul, this individual was winding down in his emeritus years. Being a pragmatically intelligent man that this politically influential icon is, he might begin to pontificate some scathing questions. When conversing with Chauncy Gardner, Gardner innocuously provided an inadvertent and very cogent ideology which ultimately enlightened everyone's philosophical dynamic. Amidst the technical gimmickry, which film companies spend countless millions on for purposes of impressing the movie viewers, as a result, filmmakers will lose perspective on the essential human element. These production companies engage in an egregiously miscalculated assessment of people in general! By this, I mean that movie's commensurate plots should portray a scenario whereby: Before we are anything else, we are human beings! The movie \"Being There\" did indeed depict such a humanistic plight! This film formats the bittersweet rewards and repercussions of just being a faulted individual, to which I say, such an emotionally auspicious quality, makes this film absolutely fabulous! The acting in \"Being There\" was realistically articulated by some very accomplished actors and actresses (Peter Sellers, Shirley Maclaine, and Jack Warden, to name but a few). The director, Hal Ashby, is world renowned for his directorial excellence, the laundry list of his critically acclaimed films includes \"Coming Home\" which, in my opinion, is one of the greatest movies to ever hit the cinema! What is the gist to the movie \"Being There\"? Basically this, \"You want reassuring optimism to quell your primal doubts?\" Chauncy Gardner delivers! Gardner (Peter Sellers) is BEING THERE FOR YOU!! Fantastic film!! It possessed a very 1970's style character portrayal which was very well rounded and stunningly real! I especially loved the ending!!",

We were so glad we didn't spend the money to see it in the theater.Yes, the premise is that Chance is supposed to be an idiot spouting simple phrases, and the idea is that people mistake it for profundity, or at least make these statements profound with their own wishful thinking. Yes, people can be fooled initially. BUT...All Chance does is keep spouting simple phrases and otherwise staring out vacuously. And nobody gets suspicious? Worse yet, Chance is shown to have no feelings. He is completely indifferent to the death of the man he lived under for decades. We could laugh at the idea of idiocy being taken for profundity (happens all the time in real life), but there's nothing funny about someone without feelings.As another poster remarked, Peter Sellers was evidently a worse psychological basket case than his biographies said.I decided to add a few things, in light of the surprising number of glowing reviews this movie has had. Of course there are always people who think a particular movie, no matter how bad it really is, is something wonderful and meaningful. But in this movie, I find that those who praise this movie fail to understand that they are the ones being mocked by the storyline.The premise is that people who are rich and powerful are all taken in by the idea that Chance is a genius rather than the brain-dead person he really is. I was waiting to see how everyone was going to react when they realized who Chance really was, but that never happens. People who have gotten where they were through guile and ambition are so gullible as all that? Nobody gets suspicious over a man with no apparent background, not even any home or family? I would have found it infinitely more believable if the rich and powerful actually knew Chance was just a simpleton, and manipulated him as a front man, but that is not what happens in this story.As for the claim that Chance was only misinterpreted as especially brilliant because he was white, and wouldn't be if he were black, that idea was made obsolete with the election of President Obama. He was hyped as a messiah who would work miracles, and as it turns out he is at best just another politician.",

            "content": "A person can have only one TRULY FAVORITE MOVIE, and \"Being There\" is mine. The story is one giant metaphor represented by Peter Sellers' character's name, \"Chance.\" In the early part of the story, where Shirley MacClaine (Eve) asks his name, as he takes a large gulp of liquor - thinking it's water - and she mishears his attempt at saying \"Chance the Gardener,\" to be \"Chauncy Gardiner,\" if he had succeeded in conveying the answer he intended, he'd have been treated differently. He would probably have been housed in the Rand's servants' wing, and dismissed in a couple of days when his injury healed. The circumstance after leaving his lifelong residence, and ending the day where he encountered Eve's limo and sustained the accident leading to his joining her and Ben (Melvyn Douglas) in their palatial residence, also occurred completely by \"chance.\" In the mentioned early scene in the limo, where Eve asks his name, and believing it to be Chauncy Gardiner - even then \"Chance\" doesn't in anyway have, or display, the least bit of pretense. Later, at dinner, when Ben asks if he may call him Chauncy, he doesn't pretend it's his name, but simply says, \"Chauncy's fine.\" The gist of the film is simple and direct - yet this makes the story more powerful and compelling. Everything - everything - Chance/Chauncy says is literal, true and unadulterated. Yet everyone takes each comment or statement he makes as a metaphor, idiom or in some other figurative manner. His simple, brief, straight answers are taken as depicting a confident wisdom. In addition, a lot of his conversation is simply a reiteration of what the other person has said, which results in that person admiring him all the more, and (whether consciously or otherwise) feeling that his/her own wisdom or opinion or correctness has been affirmed. From the outset, we cannot help but \"root\" for him, and fear that this man who gains in prominence and becomes so widely quoted, admired and respected, will be found-out to be a simple man who wants nothing more than ACTUALLY to be a \"GARDENER.\" The only character who suspects, and then confirms Chance/Chauncy's true persona, is Richard Dysatt's physician. We also are grateful that he realizes Chance possesses no guile or ulterior motives (and really doesn't have the capacity for either). This movie has a lot, on a number of levels. There are top performances from all involved, from the great Peter Sellers to the other leading personnel (especially Douglas; Dysart; and Jack Warden, as the President), as well as the minor characters and actors. We are given a lot in the film's message, as we compare Chance, not only with respect to the other characters, but also ourselves. Melvyn Douglas, as Ben, makes various references in the film's dialog, to Chauncy's youth, his life being before him, etc. - as opposed to his character's/Ben's terminal illness. Ironically, in real life, Peter Sellers died suddenly, at age 54, the year following the picture's release; Melvyn Douglas passed away a year later, at age 81",

Ashby courageously allows 'quiet' to accumulate on the soundtrack, without any detriment to the movie. It's striking.

This could have so easily turned into a screed, but it never loses its gentle humanity. It also could have become too twee. At the surface level, the movie is a wonder of poignance. But at the polemic level, it's an awesome treasure trove. I lack the time to delve into the myriad ideas it encompasses.

So seldom embracing the philosophy that Less is More, he does so here, and the effect is devastating. Chance the gardener is a creation of depth and pathos. Sellers went out on a high.",

            "content": "It's set in the 1970s in Washington, D. C., and is a satiric comedy about the political elites of the U. S. government. Viewers will recall that the movie was issued within five years of Richard Nixon's resignation.Chance, the gardener (Peter Sellers), is an intellectually-challenged middle-aged man who has lived his entire life behind the walls of a wealthy man named Jennings. Chance is unable to read or write. Nevertheless, he is a careful gardener and spends the rest of his time watching television. When the wealthy old man dies, Chance is evicted by the estate's lawyers, who can find no trace of Chance in their records.Wandering the streets of Washington, Chance is injured in a minor accident involving a limousine owned by a wealthy but dying billionaire named Ben Rand (Melvyn Douglas). Ben is a close confidant of the President of the United States (Jack Warden). Rand's much younger wife, Eve (Shirley MacLaine), takes Chance home for treatment for his leg injury. She has misunderstood his name to be Chauncey Gardiner.Everyone is immediately taken by \"Chauncey's\" quiet demeanor and the endless \"metaphors\" about gardening he spouts when confronted with a question about which he knows nothing. After meeting the President, he becomes a mystery power-broker, appearing on a late-night talk show, charming the Russian ambassador, and refusing to be interviewed by reporters. On almost all occasions, his eyes are on whatever TV set is nearby and turned on.The closing scene adds another level of mystery about Chance, the gardener.This is a broad-stroked mockery of the Washington, D. C. power structure, where image and cachet trump intellectual depth every time, and rumors inside the beltway have enormous influence. \"Being There\" was fun when I first saw it and again in 2022. It is well-paced, and Melvyn Douglas is excellent as the dying tycoon. Shirley MacLaine is also outstanding.",

He doesn't put a foot wrong throughout as Chance, the simpleton gardener who finds himself offering the most simplistic of advice to heads of state (and the general populace via TV) and having it misinterpreted as nuggets of wisdom. It's a good idea for a story but one that requires a huge suspension of disbelief as we see otherwise intelligent people incapable of seeing the truth of what is in front of them. Chance never sounds like he is dispensing pearls of wisdom \u0096 he sounds like he's rambling inanely about the cycle of the seasons: which is exactly what he's doing.The film has one of those endings that forces the audience to reflect over every little thing that has gone before and to re-assess their opinion about what each scene and every sentence of dialogue means \u0096 which is no mean feat and to be applauded, but the suspicion lingers that a deliberate ambiguity in exposition has offered too many people the opportunity to believe there is a depth to this tale that doesn't really exist.This one's a fairy tale for those looking for meaning in the most prosaic of treatments. Watch it for Sellers' career-best performance (and a scene from Shirley Maclaine that you never imagined you'd see) but, as the film suggests \u0096 and there, perhaps, its real strength lies \u0096 be careful not to over-analyse.",

            "content": "Peter Sellers takes the lead in another masterpiece, Being There, this time playing a simple man, Chauncey Gardener, who finds himself the center of national attention when his thoughts on gardening are perceived as grand metaphors for the national economy. Chauncey, or Chance, has tended the garden of a reclusive wealthy man for his whole life, but when the man dies, he is forced to leave. Oblivious to the world and constantly enchanted by television, Chauncey sets out on the streets of D.C. with only a suitcase and his remote. Perplexed to see himself on a display window television, Chance accidentally steps off the curb and a car backs into him. Luckily, the car is populated by Eve Rand, wife of very wealthy and influential Ben Rand. Chauncey finds himself living in the Rand mansion, favored by the dying Ben, meeting the President, and much desired by Eve. No one but the Rands' doctor suspects Chance of not being a highly intelligent former businessman, and Chance quickly finds himself in the national news for his profound insights on \"gardening\". This is one of the least seen important movies out there (not under-rated by any means, it is highly critically acclaimed). It is amazing how this movie maintains, and even has perhaps greater, relevance to today's world. This is also full of great dialogue and humor. When there is music, it goes perfectly with the visual part; when there is silence, it still speaks.\n'Being There' has several implied messages in it, all best for a viewer to deduce on his own. The focus is primarily on perception, how a person observes only what their mindset already knows or believes. Chauncey's simple nature highlights the ways of those around him, showing people as they really are, insecurities and all. Chauncey's weightless words, when mistaken as profundity, reveal how much emphasis and importance we as a society place on empty phrases. Television weaves it way throughout the film, complementing, primarily through audio, the scene around it in some very unique ways. The final scene is one of immense beauty, showing a complete triumph in editing, sound, visual composition, story, meaning, and dialogue (\"Life... is a state of mind\").",

            "content": "This is a pretty famous movie, but I don't agree with any of the reasons why it was so well-received. If you really want to watch it, go ahead. Just know what you're getting into.Reason 1: Peter Sellars gives a tour-de-force performance. I don't agree. Yes, he's usually known for playing hilarious roles, but Being There wasn't his first or only dramatic performance. For a truly great dramatic performance from Sellars, watch Hoffman. In Being There, he gives one dull expression, and it's far from impressive.Reason 2: Melvyn Douglas gives an Academy Award winning performance. Technically, that's true; he won the Oscar in 1980, but I thought it was undeserved. In this movie, he was 78 years old, and unfortunately, his aging process had rendered him unrecognizable. I felt very sad watching his performance; he was very frail. I have great respect for actors who continue working through their old age, but I didn't see a very powerful performance in this case.Reason 3: Shirley MacLaine is dynamite. I love Shirley MacLaine, but I don't even understand why she took this role. Call me old-fashioned, but decades of filmmaking during the Hays Code proved actresses were able to show off every talent without taking their clothes off or doing a sex scene. I've never been impressed by someone's acting talents because of an 'R' rating. I'm not spoiling anything, because this is far from being a critical plot point, but there's a scene in the movie where Shirley MacLaine, well, does herself a favor. I'm convinced one of the only reasons why this movie got any attention at all was because of this scene.Reason 4: The plot is deep and poignant. I don't agree. Being There is about a simple-minded gardener who soaks up and believes what the television shows him. I don't think that's very deep; I think he's just simple-minded. Due to a misunderstanding, the gardener is believed to be a rich, intelligent businessman. People take his simple statements to be very profound, and he influences everyone's lives. Again, I don't think that's deep. It's an obvious mockery, too obvious, in my opinion.Kiddy Warning: Obviously, you have control over your own children. However, due to a graphic sex scene, I wouldn't let my kids watch it.",

Everyone who meets him is impressed, but no one really agrees on why.While the movie focuses on politics and money, it's strikingly unspecific, with everyone speaking in such a way that you couldn't say what anyone's political beliefs are. The movie sees idiocy as a non-partisan issue, focusing on powerful people's ability to believe whatever they want.There are some funny moments, but for me in 2017, not a lot of them.

The Douglas character was once a force to be reckoned with but his illness has mellowed him and he becomes friends with a man who has led an isolated life gardening and watching television. Chauncey's sudden influence seems to expose the platitudes and empty phrases of those in power. His down to earth advice, drawn from his many years as a gardener, are turned into high sounding platitudes that the wealthy tycoon and the President apply to national issues. Sellers' unaffected ways appeal to Douglas and he elevates the man to the status of a wise and learned statesman. Shirley MacLaine, as wife of the tycoon, falls in love with Chauncy but the \"affair\" is more platonic than physical, given Chancy's inexperience with sexuality. People's attraction to Chauncy is based on his honesty and his naive acceptance of everyone he encounters.

There is not a moment in the film when he is not doing precisely what he had planned to do the night before.  He is clean, quiet, and crisp for the entire picture, always walking the thin line between any definable emotions his character \"Chance\" might have.  He never lunges at a single choice, he simply lets the choice happen itself.  The perfectionist in him knew that if he gave the role any clear objectives other than wanting to watch T.V., he would come across as more than what Chance was: a naive gardener who goes with the flow and always remembers to say \"thank you\".The story concerns a man who, due to the death of his boss, suddenly finds himself having to leave the house at which he has tended the garden all his life, the house that he has never left before.  Out and about in the rough, modern Washington D.C., he quickly falls into the hands of Eve Rand, the wife of Ben Rand (played by Melvyn Douglas, who got the Oscar for his Supporting role), who is a multi-millionaire banker.  Chance's unusually simplistic manner of speaking (one that he has because, always guarded from the outside world, he doesn't know how to be any more expressive with his words) wins over the Rands, and soon, Chance's background becomes of national interest after he gives the President some down-to-earth advice on the economy.  Essentially, this is a film about being at peace with life, and letting that which does not matter truly slide.  The Late Great Hal Ashby flexes superior director muscles here, showing us, like all the Greats do, that simple works.  \"I like to watch.\"",

Mr Sellers - much loved in Britain since his days on the wireless in \"Educating Archie\" and \"The Goon Show\" - went global ,as they say,in the 1960s in tandem with the rather tiresome \"Swinging London\" bandwagon. Hardly a shrinking violet beforehand,he gradually developed the successful actor's appetite for believing his own publicity and this unfortunate tendency culminated in Hal Ashby's \"Being There\" which,in my opinion,is one of the least of Mr Sellers' works. Chance the gardener is not an idiot savant - he's just an idiot - full stop.The possibility that anybody with an IQ running into double figures would believe otherwise just does not exist. The film's whole house of cards collapses with that premise. He is a bear of very Little brain evicted from the Hundred Acre Wood.

However the movie sags a little in its 2 hours due to the predictable one dimensional plot with most scenes ending with the gormless expression of the leading character. This is where Sellers genius could have been more utilized. For example, throughout the film he is seen copying actions and behaviour from people on TV, just imagine how good this movie could have been if he'd gone further by say mimicking voices and accents - which copiers tend to do. Sellers was of course one of cinema's greatest mimics.There is more than a touch of Stan Laurel in Sellers performance and he is convincing but there was a lot of scope to develop the character which never materialised leaving a sense of unfulfillment.Despite the underdevelopment of character, it is still an enjoyable watch and interesting.One footnote, the US Government, media and corporate leaders in the film are fooled which at the time of the film would have been more amusing than it is today.

Therefore, one can easily tell that the characters with which he interacts have fallen subject to, and ultimately portray, the evil that Chance opposes. It is not that Chance \"opposes\" evil; he simply can't partake in evil; it is against his nature. This is many times regarded as naivet\u00e9, which is not the case. Chance is not ignorant of evil much like God is not ignorant of sin.Some have suggested that Chance is a Christ figure, and I think that might be taking things a bit too far.

            "content": "His brain has been provided with a budget of childish abstractions about the world, framed in denominations of the garden where he has worked all his adult life. Yet since he appears to be a man of refined lineage, his naivet\u00e9 is misconstrued for wisdom, and before long he is counseling presidents and patronizing millionaires. He is Chance. We grasp he's lived all of his life inside the townhouse of a wealthy hermit. He comprehends what he has to for his day-to-day algorithm: Where his bedroom and bathroom are, how to maintain the bordered garden. Jerzy Kosinski's story offers no conclusion for his predicament. He's capable of reacting to likely signals, and can, to a point, modify and commit things to memory.Chance is played by Peter Sellers as a man in harmony with himself. When the old man dies, the household is broken up and Chance is evicted, there's a renowned moment where he is encountered by street punks, and merely aims a channel changer at them, and clicks. He is baffled when they do not disappear. Sellers plays Chance at precisely the same pitch for the whole film. He is aloof, low-key, sure in his own expertise, blind to his stumbling blocks.Through a succession of blessed accidents, he is taken into the home of a dying millionaire and set up in a guest suite, where he is pleased to find a television. Shortly the rich man comes to cherish his comforting companion. The family doctor is astute, and starts to have apprehensions about \"Chauncey\"'s credibility, though bites his tongue when his patient says Chauncey \"has made the thought of dying much easier.'' Chauncey is introduced to the president, played by Jack Warden, comes to be an informal adviser, and soon is being interviewed on television, where his wisdom applies neatly to the confined duration of sound bites.Satire is a vulnerable breed in American film, and when it does arise, it's ordinarily explicit and slapstick, as in the Mel Brooks classics. Sellers' penultimate film, directed by Hal Ashby, is an exceptional and sophisticated outing that pinpoints its inflection and sticks with it. Chance endures a sequence of trials he doesn't get, saying things that are both omnipresent and absurd. But are Chance's axioms any more valuable than when President Bush told us about \"the politics of cynicism?\" Realistic community address in our time is restricted by the obligation to keep within the confines of the 10-second TV sound bite, the longing to eschew being manacled to particular declarations or assurances and the reduced attention span of the American audience, which, like Chance, likes to watch but constantly waits with the channel-changer.The film is not immaculate. There are two sex-related strands, and neither one is significant. The story of the president's impotence could have been totally discarded. And the seduction effort by Shirley MacLaine, as the millionaire's wife, obligates her to behave in a less deft way than she should. She, like the doctor, should have had a hunch, and that would have developed much wittier scenes than her awkward affectations on a bear rug.In the oft-contested final shot, the movie presents us with an image, and while one may argue the connotations of the image, one cannot concoct clarifications of it. Because Ashby does not present unseen support, there is no support: A movie is just what it presents to us, and nothing more. So what does it show us? It shows us Chance doing something that is chiefly identified with just one other person in history. What are we to consider? That the insights of beloved luminaries merely have the look of profundity? That like Wyle E. Coyote he will not fall until he grasps his predicament? That we recognize in ideology and theology whatever we angle for? Is it likely that we are all simply smarter forms of Chance? That we are conditioned from an early age to react accordingly to accustomed green lights and assumptions? That we never actually contemplate a great deal of anything for ourselves, but are comfortable with duplicating what works for others in the same circumstances?",

            "content": "I'm a big fan of both Peter Sellers and Hal Ashby, so this was a real treat. Ashby's simple, straightforward film-making perfectly backs up a simple, straightforward character played honestly and charismatically by Sellers. Just like how the characters use Chance as a way of projecting their needs outwards and clearing up their fears, the film is readily willing to allow you to put whatever you want into it, whether it be the nature of simplicity, the effects of television on people, and like themes.But overall, it's a heartwarming and wonderful parable, something that, despite its sometimes sexual content, is really open for anybody to enjoy (though I don't know, kids or such might be a little bored by the prolonged way it presents its story).Only because I saw the latter recently, I thought I'd mention that this seems an interesting precursor to a Japanese movie that came out last year named Bin-jip (3-Iron). Both deal with invisible characters living on the fringe of society who eventually take in all that the other characters give them (kindness in Being There, hatred in Bin-jip) and transcend to another plane of existence. In Being There, Sellers' transcendence is Biblical, while in Bin-jip the mute is Buddhist. Both of them are really good movies and make interesting companion pieces, so if you were awed by this movie, you should check out the other one.Anyway, the key thing I got out of this movie was that Chance, being unable to really communicate the way people expect of him, is unaware that he makes the perfect listener. His \"I like to watch\" line is taken just as the characters take it: he is meant to provide the necessary objectivity needed in a room so that the characters can subjectively clear out their own anxieties and conscience. The familiar and warm presence of Sellers works great for this, because he of all people is really comforting to watch in his various roles.--PolarisDiB",

Perhaps it takes a European, Jerzy Kosinki, or Vladimir Nabokov, in the earlier case, to adapt their own well-considered novels to the screen and get it so right. \"Chance,\" a mentally challenged gardener, living in the house of a wealthy old man is forced out when the old man dies and, wearing his clothes, soon finds himself, quite by chance, in the house of a much wealthier and more influential man, where he is taken to be \"Chauncey Gardner.\" The photography, costumes, sets and the design is wonderful, but, sometimes, the joke runs a bit long and stretches a bit far.",

This could have been a one-joke film, but the terrific writing and directing, and the simply magical performance by Peter Sellers make this deep, complex, and moving. There's great supporting work too by Shirley McLain and Melvyn Douglas. Jack Warden overdoes the doofus bit a little as the president, and there are a couple of moments where the jokes feel forced, but this is as funny and socially incisive a film as has been made in the last 30 years.",

In this film Peter Sellers plays the part of a simple, yet extremely warm man named Chance. Chance is middle aged and has never experienced the outside world. From what we can ascertain he has always been in the care of the \"Old Man\" who is no relation just a kind hearted millionaire, and his maid Louise. Unfortunately the old man dies leaving Louise with no job and now Chance with no home. This is where the film takes off. As the film progresses through i think it would be hard for any one to not feel deep sorrow and empathy for the character played by Sellers. Although many of Sellers films are quite obviously classics for his comedy genius, this film shows what he really was capable of as an actor given the chance (no pun intended) to play a straight role. For those of you who have some knowledge of Sellers i think that you may not be able to watch this film without feeling that the character of chance is more of sellers own deep inner personality than you would get to see in his every day life.

The Drama? Gospel according Jerry, Hal and Peter? What is it about Chance the Gardner aka Chauncey Gardiner (Peter Sellers) simple minded, possibly retarded character that everyone admires so much?It is a prophetic film - how often we've seen individuals that have been elevated to high political office for simply looking good and smiling nice on television. It is a story of a man who was an embodiment of purity and child-like innocence of such high concentration that he could be called a retard - depending on your state of mind. Chance is always himself - he never pretends to be something other than a gardener. All he wants is to watch TV and work in a garden taking care of the plants and flowers. Having meals on time would not hurt, either. Whatever happened to Chance only happened because he was there - in the right time in the right place. But was it a right time and place for anybody? Was Chance the answer to the problems the country was going through? Of course, not. I agree with the comments that the society has the rulers it deserves - if we believe that Chance's messages are profound and deep, we very much deserve him as our leader. It is very sad film, I think. It has many hilarious scenes, jokes, and dialogs but it is not a comedy, and not a feel good movie. It is a sublime, intelligent meditation on very serious matters - politics and media and how they relate to each other; the great power of being there and projecting the image the public wants to admire and follow. How easy is it for us to be fooled, especially when we want to be fooled?Speaking of the last scene, there are plenty of good explanations here. I just think that if we are made to believe that the man with the development of 4-5 years old is able to move from a garden in DC to the highest level of fame, why can't we believe that he can actually ***spoiler*** walk on the water? ***end of spoiler*** Anything is possible, it is Chance who does not know it, we the audience saw it happened.Peter Sellers is magnificent. I don't think that anybody else could've done what he did with the character.

Reading the comments from all over the world has been a joy - they have resurrected and illuminated a memory that stayed with me for many years after that otherwise uneventful night which was the beginning of the end for local cinemas in Australia.I insisted that everybody in my local welfare office go and see it. Many of them did! Men & Women went around for years talking 'Chance talk' - \"Now.. get.. this honky...\" \"I ain't takin' no jive...from no chicken shyt Western Union Mess..enger\". \"I understand...\" \"I'm glad you didn't.. open...Eve..\" I could go on.

            "content": "Peter Sellers used to say that he had no personality at all. He therefore prided himself on completely disappearing into his wide range of characters; so much so, that in Dr. Strangelove, he plays three completely different oddballs, and you wouldn't notice unless you looked a little bit closer. In Being There, he is as the title states - drifting from destination to destination, with a mere shell for a personality, and yet this is what makes his rise to stardom and fame. Hal Ashby sketches the world of the American public and politics as one giant caricature, so easily lulled into believing that if a man can wear the right clothes, nod at the right times, say \"yes please\" and speak in short, simple truisms, the rest of his character can be drawn for him. Many wild assumptions are made of this plain, unassuming man - that he is fluent in Russian, that he is a successful and insightful businessman, that he sees so clearly the state of the economy and how a fruitful period is just around the corner. The joke that is established early on is that Chance the gardener is mistaken for the venerable Chauncey Gardiner, a man who speaks in frank terms of the nation's issues as if he was simple referring to a little menial garden work. The metaphor is easily fit for almost any situation, but here it represents the United States itself, and the two-minded president, the loving gardener who presides over it. The society that they inhabit is so overrun with flashy headlines and bit personalities that Chauncey comes as a bit of fresh air, and everything he touches turns into gold - women fawn over him, the president heeds his advice, papers want his opinions, talk shows beg for an appearance. The irony is that Chauncey is every bit as empty as the men in charge around him are. He is little more than a child, with a few select repeat phrases and a constant need for distracting stimuli - one in particular, the ever blasting flash of the TV. The media of course see this as radical; how bold and no nonsense! Again, the irony that he is no more deep and complex than a character from one of the trashy shows he adores. In fact all the Ashby's characters seem to be taken right from the television set; they are all broadly drawn, and talk and talk and talk without ever once saying anything of actual substance. Not one interaction here makes a connection of any kind; like Chauncey, humorously and almost painfully simple, they exist on a completely different level from their surroundings. The film is funny, of course, in a dark and often absurd way. This all rests on Sellers. He refuses (until the closing credits) to break even once, to reveal a hint of a sardonic smile, an offhand giggle, an un-earned teardrop. The whole film is played completely straight, and this all comes from his portrayal. He advises on the proper procedure for watering sprouts, and this is taken to the furthest possible potential for such an ordinary comment. He makes literal statements that are mistaken for the most hilarious lines delivered as deadpan. He nods and agrees and somehow becomes an expert in Russian lit - and Ivan Krylov to boot too. Every simple, childlike statement is extrapolated to its extremity, and overnight he is a household name and public celebrity. Ridiculous? Every bit and then some. It is an elaborate fantasy, and that is its appeal, to the chagrin of realists and cynics everywhere. But quietly, and over the years, it has becomes less a satirical absurdity and more a half-truth. The easiest way today to make the headlines would be to cause a stir - visibility is explodes from the simplest, and often stupidest things. And the final scene. What a brilliant, brilliant scene this is. Ben Rand, respected adviser, is dead. The vultures immediately pinpoint a weakness in the current presidency. Ashby layers his grandiose, heartfelt eulogy to his close friend with the quiet mutterings of the black suits carrying the coffin - hilariously, they have already begun to plot his replacement. Chauncey has been an instant hit, and they see him as their only option. I like to put my own little spin on this absurd incident; I like to imagine that the pallbearers are actually the top members of the secret Freemasons society, pulling the presidential strings from behind the shadows, orchestrating America to their desires and causes. Their oldest member has just passed on - what better man to replace him than the most popular celebrity in the country? The tomb itself is basically a mini- pyramid; a jutting, egotistic final resting place adorned with the Eye of Providence. And where is the chosen one to ascend to their ranks? He is at water's edge, tentatively stepping out onto the lake. To everyone else it is not tentative steps, but firm, Christ-like strides across the water. Is he checking the depth with his umbrella, or have we succumbed to his worship too? We do not know whether Chauncey even knows of drowning - perhaps this is why he glides so easily on the water's surface. Or perhaps the viewer is simply willing it to happen. Stranger things have been accepted as truth before.",

And he likes to watch television like a moth to a light. His caretaker dies and he's forced to the streets where an unlikely chain of events brings him to the attention of a powerful political pawnbroker, Benjamin Turnbul Rand, as played by film veteran Melvyn Douglas.

Bush and almost every presidential candidate as well. Douglas won the Academy award for Best Supporting Actor in the role and Sellers was nominated for Best Actor but lost the Oscar to Dustin Hoffman for Kramer Vs. Kramer. Being There did win several film industry awards and was nominated for six Golden globe Awards, winning two. Also in the cast are Shirley McLaine, Jack Warden, Richard Dysart and Richard Basehart. Jerzy Kosinski adapts the screenplay from his novel. Hal Ashby who had some fine films in Harold and Maude, Shampoo, The Last Detail and Coming home directs. It's a great comedy that doubles as a thoughtful drama with a fantasy ending. The only thing about this I didn't like were the closing credits scenes where Ashby strayed from the originality of his film and reverted to using flubbed outtakes from Sellers like it was all a zany Pink Panther film.

Being There is about the simple minded gardener named Chance, played by Sellers. When the owner of the estate that Chance has lived his entire life on dies, Chance is thrust out into the real world. Chance's life is changed when Eve Rand accidentally hits him with her car. Chance goes back to Eve's mansion where he meets he husband, a wealthy businessman, Ben Rand, who is dying of bone cancer. Rand has a close relationship to the president of the United States, giving Chance, who everybody now thinks is named Chauncey Gardiner because of a mumbled misunderstanding upon his and Eve's first encounter, a chance to meet the president. Chance's quips about gardening and television are mistaken for profound insight into economics and politics, making Chance a star in the political world. On the surface it is an easy going plot but it houses a lot of heartwarming sentiments as well as political satire that gives it a very brilliant and unique flare.It is difficult to come by a film as sweet and intelligent as this one. It is a very unique and charming experience that had a certain edge to it that I really enjoyed. It delivers a unique story with an assortment of very unique characters, especially Seller's portrayal of the protagonist, Chance. The film is a fantastically entertaining experience from start to finish. It is a very sincere and a very real film, that doesn't cheat its viewer by giving us what we expect or what we hope for. It casually draws itself out to a very wholehearted and well rounded experience. It is a very intelligently and diligently made film that stays true to what filmmaking is all about. The film displays a slow paced brilliance that is so captivating. It has it's laugh out loud moments that are so uniquely amusing, but then it also displays very sincere moments with a lot of heart. Being There is a very worthwhile film experience.This film's cast is possibly what drives it so well and keeps it so real and so alive. Peter Sellers pulls off the role of a lifetime as Chance the gardener. He is a very naive man, but is honestly more insightful and intelligent about the world in his own way than many people consider themselves to be. Everything he knows he's learned from television and, unknown to him, has learned to enjoy the finer and simpler things in life simply by not concerning himself with the larger troubles that surround the rest of us. The character is incredible and Seller's performance is top notch. The supporting cast reflect the rest of the world very well. Shirley MacLaine plays Eve, whose role is very important to the development of Chance and she does an excellent job. The strongest of the supporting roles is certainly Melvyn Douglas as the frail old Ben Rand. Douglas' role earned him an Oscar for best supporting actor, and watching his captivating performance alongside Sellers was proof that he deserved it. He delivers a very heartfelt performance and his character reflects the main themes of the film surrounding life and death and what we truly live for in our short lives.Being There is a magnificent film that makes you think without forcing anything down your throat. It tells a heartwarming story and it stays true to the themes it expresses throughout. Being There is a very honest and real film that was an absolute joy to watch. It is a movie that can be easily lost amongst all the other terrific films that came out in 1979, earning it the title of a hidden gem that you don't want to miss.",

When the previous owner of the house dies Chance is made to move out and begins an aimless wander into the outside word.From Chance's first interaction with people, he is revealed as not having a personality. He has spent his whole life socialising with a television, and his mind has turned into one.

He has a kind of fear: but it comes across as the fear of a deer in the wild, rather than a human responding to a situation based on past experiences and future plans and desires.Being There suggests the idea that a human personality is shaped by socialisation: we are products of our interactions. Chance's interactions have been with a television, and he has been shaped through those interactions. In this we hear both echoes of Locke's notion of tabula rasa, and the Hegelian thought that our personalities are the result of our interactions with external beings.Being There however is not only about the nature of the human self. As Chance moves into the world, he encounters a range of people that project themselves onto him. He tells Eve (the wife of a wealthy businessman that he gains the favour of) that he is Chance the gardener; from this point on he is known as Chauncey Gardiner \u2013 a name one would not be surprised to hear in wealthy circles.When he repeats something someone says to him, or something he heard on television, he is viewed as speaking words of wisdom: people take him to be a modern Confucius; a man who expresses great truths through vague statements. Others take him to be espousing economic theory, a tendency towards sexual deviance, or reflections on death.Being There is a philosophical masterpiece but is also comedy. There is something hilarious about the seriousness of the people that project their agendas onto Chance. It is not incidental that the things taken by Chance to be statements of wisdom are taken straight from television or from the mouths of others. The movie is making fun of what humans take to be wisdom: of how we hear ideas and repeat them without truly reflecting on them. This perfect blend of comedy and deep insight is encapsulated by the music to that plays when Chance enters the world: a jazz/funk arrangement over Also Sprach Zarathustra by Richard Strauss.Sellers plays this role perfectly. Throughout the whole movie he never once fails to convince. A personality simply never emerges to make us sense that this is an actual person pretending to be nothing. It is simply astonishing that Sellers failed to win an Oscar for this performance: who really takes the Academy Awards seriously anyway?Hal Ashby, the director of Being There, is not well known in 2015. In researching Being There I discovered that shortly after making this movie Ashby entered a downward spiral of drugs and unreliability, and never made another well-regarded movie. The movies Ashby made before Being There are also nowhere near its greatness. We are left to speculate whether Ashby had only one great idea, or whether the world was deprived of more masterpieces due to a premature decline.This review was taken from: amateurreviewspace.blogspot.com",

The character that he plays in this film is much more complex (for a simpleton!) than his brilliantly-played Clouseau. His character in this film, Chance the Gardener, was probably not an easy part to play, yet Sellers pulls it off brilliantly. The rest of the cast is up to par, also. This film should be seen at least 3-4 times before you begin to pass judgment on it. You'll see the depth in the film after a few viewings. It is funny on the surface, but the humor is enhanced after several screenings. I gave this film a 9 and I recommend it highly to everyone!",

            "content": "That's what \"Being There\" is for me. Just, being there. Which is also why I have always loved this movie so much. The only thing that stops me from naming \"Being There\" as my favorite movie -- ever -- is that I consider it impossible to name any one movie as my favorite movie -- ever. I mean, can one say that \"Being There\" is better than \"The Wizard of Oz,\" \"Citizen Kane,\" \"The Bridge on the River Kwai,\" \"North by Northwest\" or any one of dozens of other classic movies? I cannot, no matter how much I love it. But it is in the same class as all of those classic movies and that's good enough. For me.\"Being There\" was the first of \"The Big Three\" of demi-recent idiot-savant movies, the other two being \"Rain Man\" and \"Forrest Gump.\" It is also the least popular of the three, the least well-received by movie critics and the least recognized for its achievements in terms of awards. All of which phases me not in the least. When a moviegoer truly believes in and loves a movie, nothing can sway that cine-o-phile from his or her belief and love. And that's how it is with \"Being There\" and mineself.I guess what I like most about \"Being There\" is the multitude of subtle nuances in the plot. Oh, sure. The acting is great. How could it not be with Peter Sellers, Shirley MacLaine and Melvyn Douglas, not to mention the strong supporting cast? But don't forget! In order for actors to have a chance to be great, they have to be given characters that are great to play, as well as meaningful things to say and do. And in this movie, the characters are given all of that by novelist-screenwriter Jerzy Kosinski.It would be very easy to say this is Peter Sellers' movie, since everything and everyone in it revolve around him. He's the person, after all, who morphs from Chance, the ever simple-minded gardener, into Chauncey Gardner, deep thinker on all matters of great import. But if the other actors were unable to play off of the Chance/Chauncey character in any or some meaningful way, then there would be no movie. \"Being There\" could never have been a one-man movie. That's why Melvyn Douglas won a Best Supporting Actor Oscar for his portrayal of the dying Ben Rand. And as good as Peter Sellers is in the main role, it is, surprisingly, Shirley MacLaine who wins my heart among the three stars.She plays Eve Rand, Ben's wife, and the person who first \"discovers\" Chance. In her own way, she's as guileless as Chance himself. She's the first person to perform the \"makeover\" on Chance, converting him to Chauncey. The rest of the cast just runs with it from there. But in every single scene in which she appears in this movie, without exception, she is warm, tender and loving. Loving of her dying husband -- AND -- of Chance. Er, Chauncey. Every time I watch this movie, I'm ALWAYS hoping for, rooting for, Eve and Chauncey to fall in love, even though I know it would be impossible for the hopelessly empty mind of Chauncey to ever love any woman. And their big \"love scene\" is as good as it's ever going to get for Eve, even though she doesn't know that. Her performance of a certain act for Chauncey simply because he \"likes to watch\" (it's TV that he \"likes to watch,\" but she thinks he's referring to something else), is one for the ages. It is scenes like that which make Ms. MacLaine SO LOVABLE in this movie.All in all, \"Being There\" sums up my philosophy of life. Just ..... being there. And every time I watch \"Being There,\" I absolutely LOVE ..... being there.",

She wasn't convinced this was a comedy at first during the beginning scenes but commented how weird it was becoming and did laugh a few times as did I. She also commented on the resemblance of Chance the gardener to Tom Hanks' Forrest Gump in characterization. Beforehand, I read Peter Sellers based his interpretation of Chance on Stan Laurel and I can see that. It's quite a performance to watch seeing many familiar Stan-like mannerisms in Sellers. I also liked seeing many of the other characters react to him especially Shirley MacLaine's and Melvyn Douglas' who won his second Oscar for this role. Sellers also was nominated but lost to Dustin Hoffman in Kramer vs. Kramer. Comparing the two, I probably would give it to Hoffman though Peter is definitely a close second. Anyway, the political satire is quite timely, even today. So on that note, I highly recommend Being There.",

Suddenly everything starts to fall into place. 'Chance' is some sort of angelic figure. No wonder he seems aloof! Can he speak Russian? Maybe. His timeless appearance also starts to make sense; his pristine suits and otherworldly manner. Suddenly many of the scenes in the movie make sense. His lack of attraction to women, his total innocence in the ways of the world, his instant likeability. Is his story in this movie luck, or divine intervention?

            "content": "For me, one of the funniest film actors of all time was Peter Sellers. The man was unbeatable when it came to comedy. He made me laugh so hard I cried in 'The Pink Panther', he made me laugh even harder in 'Dr. Strangelove' for which he received a coveted Academy Award Nomination for Best Actor in a Leading Role, and he also made me constantly chuckle during his scene-stealing role in Kubrick's controversial 1962 venture 'Lolita'. He was a real king of comedy, but who knew he was actually an immensely talented dramatic actor. In his final film 'Being There' Sellers was given a chance to do what he had always wanted to do -- show people he could act serious. Sellers succeeded with flying colors with 'Being There', giving the finest performance of 1979 which should have earned him the Best Leading Actor Oscar but unfortunately didn't. 'Being There' surrounds a simple minded idiot savant, Chance (Peter Sellers), who is the gardener for an elder gentleman who feeds, clothes, lets him watch television (which Chance is obsessed with) and looks out for him. One day the old man dies, and Chance is left homeless. He wanders the streets then finds the gold-digger wife (Shirley MacLaine) of a old, rich and dying businessman (Melvyn Douglas - who won the Best Supporting Actor Oscar for his role in this). The wife mistakes him for a rich gentleman and takes him home. Over the next month or so, Chance profoundly effects the lives of the wife, the husband, the President of the United States (Jack Warden) and television viewers everywhere. 'Being There' is a heart-felt and powerful film with a strong positive message that is only flawed due to some pacing issues.

He did though have one thing in common with most of those in his chosen field: As a comedic actor he was lively and brilliant, in reality Peter Sellers was a very quiet simple man.Throughout his life he sought sanctuary and shied away from the bright lights his genius thrust him into. In 'Being There' he plays the man who everyone swarms around, but who is blissfully un-aware of his rising notoriety and his impending thrust to the highest ranks that society has to offer.We are told that Sellers worked through films he felt nothing for so that 'Being There' could be made by an industry that seemed to care very little for such an un-assuming story. He did it just in time. I think he leaves behind a legacy of films, but it is this that is a gift to us all.It is a gift given with the helping hands of other brilliant people. Hal Ashby directs superbly. Without his incredible effort I doubt Sellers could have appeared quite so effortless.

It is stretched too thin, for too long, until it eventually feels like director Hal Ashby is insulting the audience's intelligence. This is not to say that the insult is intended, or malicious. With the great Peter Sellers creating a brilliantly blank character I suppose any director might have felt he could do no wrong. But what starts as a tongue-in-cheek joke and humorous concept soon becomes cloying.As Chance meets a stream of powerful political figures they all seem to mistake his semi-retarded babbling as profound wisdom. It's not. They also do most of the work in \"translating\" his dribble...CHANCE: We must re-seed the garden every Spring...PRESIDENT: So what you're saying is that my latest economic policy speech was poorly received because I failed to factor the rising unemployment rate and the percentage of single-income families who are living just above the poverty-line level and are therefore ineligible for our government-assisted benefits program and Federal Aid?Pause.CHANCE: Yes.Once is funny, seven times is not. \"Being There\" was based on a novel, and I'm guessing that the book was better able to sustain the whimsical fantasy better than this two-hour motion picture, which goes from funny, to fascinating, to sad and then genuinely bizarre.Director Hal Ashby may have personally cost Sellers an Oscar by playing outtakes during the film's closing credits, ruining the illusion, trivializing the story, and breaking the character.

The main character somehow manages to gain the support of the audience without portraying any extraordinary feats. Indeed it seems the main feat we find here is the very lack of anything at all, a simple man who manages to inspire people. In a way the title makes me think of the emptiness people feel and the mere presence of man who has no aura of his own lets people truly feel at ease by projecting their own ideals unto him. Initially I felt tempted to compare Chance to Forrest Gump but he is nothing like it, even though Forrest doesn't have much intellect, all that goes well with him is a product of his ingenuity and dedication. Chance of the other hand is a character with no such attributes, indeed it seems that he finds himself where he is at all times by chance, since it so happens that things happen to him at the right time, and his few words just happen to fit into the situations he find himself in. It seems the movie is about this synergy, the synergy between a man's blessed chance, and people's willingness to reach out for something that will help them feel completeness.

I find it difficult to put into words why I feel that this is the case, but I think much of it has to do with the emotional intensity he brings to the role. This is especially striking because the character he plays shows no emotion at all, which is rare in itself. Still, Sellers succeeds in making Chauncey Gardiner both a charismatic and tragic figure.

Also quite slow in parts, I kept wishing that the editing had been a bit crisper.Peter Sellers plays a very simple adult man simply named Chance. He had been born and raised entirely within the confines of the home of a wealthy man in Washington D.C. He became the gardener for the grounds, and his favorite non-gardening activity was watching TV. His whole concept of other people and the outside world was from what he saw on TV.But then his patriarch dies, the old black maid leaves, but Chance only knows one thing, that he lives there, he has his own room, and he has access to all the clothes in the attic which happen to fit him perfectly. (This becomes important later as government officials try to track down his history and find all his clothes were made long before Chance could have been born.) So, as the property is being liquidated Chance is told he has to leave, so with tophat and suitcase, off he wanders, the first time off the grounds. When he gets hungry he stops a black woman on the street and says \"I'm hungry, can I have my dinner?\"All that is background to understand who this character Chance is. After a minor accident in the street he is taken in by an even more wealthy and powerful man, Mr Rand, who meets regularly with the President. In a noisy exchange when Chance tells them he is \"the gardener\" they mistake his name for \"Chauncy Gardener.\" They further mistake his simplistic thoughts about plants and gardening for profound statements about the economy and Presidential decisions.Shirley MacLaine has a key role as the wealthy man's much younger wife Eve Rand. Melvyn Douglas is Benjamin Turnbull 'Ben' Rand. Jack Warden is President 'Bobby', and Richard Dysart is Dr. Robert Allenby, Mr Rand's personal physician.MAJOR SPOILERS FOLLOW: Mr Rand dies, and during his funeral the men talk about Chance and his possible role to replace Rand as a \"maker of kings.\" At the very end we see Chance wander off and begin to walk on the water of a lake. It isn't totally clear what this means but a plausible explanation is an allegory, that when you are simple like Chance you don't know what \"limitations\" are, and most of us as adults focus too much on what we think the limitations are.",

It's slow-going and, dare I say it, often boring. The performances are all good. I certainly respect the patience it must have taken Peter Sellers to craft this role. But it doesn't take long before Sellers is telegraphing all his punches and you realize this is a one-joke movie. I never laughed out loud, only chuckling at a few early scenes. Sadly, the movie outlasted my patience and I was done with it long before the much-praised final scene. Like the rest of the movie, that is also overrated. This is just one man's opinion and this film certainly has a lot of fans but I found it to be a little pretentious and dull for a comedy. If you want laughs, watch The Jerk instead.",

            "content": "Being There marked the end of Ashby's string of great films and the end of an era in Hollywood. Hal Ashby was considered one of the greatest directors during the mid 1970s. He edited the classic films In the Heat of the Night  and The Thomas Crown Affair and directed a string of quintessentials including the cult classic Harold and Maude, The Last Detail, Shampoo and Oscar winner Coming Home. It has been said that Ashby had a enormous passion for film, which drove him through the ranks of the Hollywood system from editor to director. Actors loved to work with the soft spoken and meticulous man, as he allowed freedom in which they could perform. Being There is a film like so many others from this period, depicting one character as an almost Christ- like figure, changing the lives of all he meets (others include One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest, & Cool Hand Luke). `Chance' is a simple minded gardner, who can't read or write. He is let out into the world for the first time and similar to Forrest Gump, but on a much smaller scale, he experiences success and fame. Peter Sellers plays the part of `Chance'; Sellers died a year later from a cardiac arrest. His performance is one of his best, as he completely envelopes the character. Sellers should be called a movie actor as opposed to a movie star because he takes a script, and changes himself to fit the screenplay/ character. Movie stars do the opposite. They change the script/ character to fit them.When viewing Being There, you completely forget you are watching Peter Sellers and only think of him as `Chance'. The film has a very metered pace to it, which might turn some astray. But this film is directed by a great editor; once you fall into the rhythm of the film, you follow it without ever looking away. Ashby took a chance with this movie both on a financial level and with the story. The film is based on a novel, and it is always hard to adapt book for the screen. The film could have been ridiculous and cheesy, but the moments that have the possibility of being unreasonable or melodramatic are natural and charming. The film is one of Ashby's best. It is an extremely enchanting story and the film covers a wide spectrum of genres including comedy, drama, and even political/ social satire (a culture of people who know nothing but what's on television). Caleb Deschanel's cinematography is breath taking, Peter Sellers gives a performance of a lifetime, and Shirley MacClain is also fantastic as the lonely and misunderstood wife. Melvyn Douglas is charming as the dying millionaire, and Jack Warden, who was in practically every film from the seventies, does a grea job as the rather lethargic president. Ashby would eventually fall into a pattern of self destructive narcotics abuse which effected him both personally and professionally. His films after Being There, are rather weak and uneven. Being There is personally one of my favorite films of all time. I give it a 9.5 out of 10 as I think it comes extremely close to perfection.",

The outtakes at the end (on my video version at least) of Sellers trying again and again to get his line out are hilarious, even more so when you realise that the scene (which would have been great) isn't even in the actual film - maybe they just gave up and forgot about it. The stand out moment, though, is when Chance is first stepping out of the house he has spent his entire life in and walking off into the big scary world, accompanied by a brilliant, funked-up version of Thus Spoke Zarathustra (or \"the 2001 music\" as everyone watching with me said, in tears of laughter).

            "content": "Chance is a mentally retarded adult who works as the gardener at the home of an elderly Washington millionaire. During the whole of his adult life, Chance has never left the house and garden; his only contact with the outside world is through television, which he watches obsessively. When his employer dies, however, the house is sold and he is forced to leave. Chance is slightly injured when he is hit by a car belonging to Eve, the wife of Benjamin Rand, a rich and influential financier and a friend of the President. Eve, mishearing \"Chance the gardener\" as \"Chauncey Gardiner\", and mistakenly believing Chance to be a successful businessman, invites him to stay with her and her husband at their home. A series of misunderstandings leads all concerned to believe that Chance is not only a businessman but also an economic prophet. He is invited to speak on national television where he talks about the only thing he understands, gardening. A series of platitudes about the changing of the seasons in the garden is taken to be an extended metaphor forecasting an upturn in the economy, and his supposed optimism strikes a chord with the viewing public. The film ends with a group of politicians deciding to draft \"Chauncey Gardiner\" as the President's successor.This film provided Peter Sellers with his one last great success; most of his other films from the seventies had been box-office flops, apart from the various \"Pink Panther\" sequels, and even those were not always popular with the critics. His Chance is a man in late middle age, older than the equivalent character in Kosinski's novella and only young by comparison with his aged employer and the ageing Rand. It is an affecting portrayal of a lonely, pitiable character, perhaps made more affecting today by the knowledge that Sellers did not have long to live after making it. We know that Chance is a simpleton, yet Sellers invests him with sufficient dignity and mystery for us to understand why others might consider \"Chauncey Gardiner\" to be a man of profound wisdom.Sellers was nominated for a \"Best Actor\" Academy Award, but lost, in an obvious miscarriage of justice, to Dustin Hoffman in \"Kramer versus Kramer\". (Even Hoffman said he could not believe he had beaten Sellers). Melvyn Douglas, however, won for \"Best Supporting Actor\" for his role as Rand, the dying old man who sees Chance as the hope for the future, and this was certainly well deserved. (Like Sellers, Douglas himself was to die within two years of the film being made). Other good contributions come from Jack Warden as the President and Shirley MacLaine as Eve.The film itself was not nominated for \"Best Picture\", although in my view it was a lot better than either \"Kramer versus Kramer\", which did win, or\"Apocalypse Now\", which many people these days seem to think should have won. Or, for that matter, than director Hal Ashby's \"Coming Home\" from the previous year, which was so nominated.\"Being There\" is nominally a comedy, but is in many ways a bleak one. (I would not, however, class it as a black comedy, a phrase which normally implies either deliberate tastelessness or getting laughs out of matters normally considered too serious to joke about). It begins with one death and ends with another. It was filmed in winter- the trees are all bare- and the colours are appropriately subdued and sombre. Much of the action takes place in the Biltmore Estate, the largest private home in America, which is used to represent Rand's stately home, and here seems grandiose but cold and forbidding. (In reality the house is located in North Carolina but for the purposes of the film it is relocated to the Washington area). The film also makes very effective use of music, based either upon Erik Satie's \"Gnossiennes\" or Richard Strauss' \"Also Sprach Zarathustra\".The film, like the Jerzy Kosinski novella on which it is based, has been interpreted as a satire on the role of television in the modern age or on the American political system. Those elements are certainly present and are perhaps emphasised more in the film than in the book. Although it was made during the Carter administration, and Kosinski's book was written nine years earlier during Nixon's presidency, parallels have sometimes been drawn between Chance and Ronald Reagan, who relied heavily on folksy imagery to get his message across. The significance of book and film, however, is a deeper one.Chance's emotional detachment allows others to treat him as what in German would be called a Wunschbild, that is to say a picture of one's wishes, a blank canvas onto which one can paint one's own desires. Each of the other characters sees in the supposed Chauncey Gardiner whatever he or she wishes to see. Rand sees him as a potential successor to his business empire and almost as an adopted son. Eve, lonely and sexually frustrated in a marriage to a much older man, sees him as a lover and a possible second husband after Rand's death. The President and his party colleagues see him as the next President. The Soviet Ambassador sees him as a liberal, Russophile capitalist who will use his influence to further east-west relations. The American TV audience see him as the man who will lead them out of recession and into prosperity. At the end he seems to be, quite literally, walking on water, making him a Christ- figure. The film certainly is, in part, a commentary on the television age. It certainly is, in part, a political satire. (We can all think of politicians who have the ability to be all things to all men). Most importantly, however, it is a brilliant fable on the human capacity for self-delusion and for seeing others not for what they are but for what we would wish them to be. 9/10",

It gets a few digs at them as impotent, entitled, and corrupt as well, but I didn't think it did it in as meaningful a way as it could have. The fact that this guy can't read or write and is addicted to TV may be seen as a metaphor but it just seemed to me he needed help, and odd that others didn't recognize it (starting from the woman who has taken care of him just leaving). The film wore thin and dragged on as well, and moments that were undoubtedly big at the time, like Shirley MacLaine's masturbation scene, just seemed silly.As for the ending? It's clever in that it's so ambiguous. This character has unwittingly fooled everyone around him into thinking he's a genius by being so simple and pure, and maybe there are elements of genius that include these qualities. Maybe true enlightenment is only possessed by those who extremely bright or extremely simple, and the rest of us in between are doomed to suffering. Anyway, at the end he unwittingly fools viewers into thinking he walks on water, causing some to see a Christ-like miracle, just as we'll believe other stories we should know simply can't be true. It's one last poke at how gullible people are, Sellers putting the mirror up to the audience now instead of his fellow actors in the cast, and showing us that we, too, will see what we want to see.",

All of its main participants had serious physical or emotional problems. It all seemed to be \"ok\" to Chance, though, and by the ending scene you feel a sense of this realization. Chance has demonstrated that \"life is a state of mind\". This is evident by his seeming to, without understanding why himself, give meaning and peace to the people he comes in contact with.Being There is more than the comedy of a simpleton, but in fact an affirmation of life.

The people who make it great are director Hal Ashby for creating a quiet atmosphere with a little help from cinematographer Caleb Deschanel's gray skies and maroon -shades-lighting, and especially Peter Sellers, whose performance mixes HAL 9000 with Rain Man or Forrest Gump. Peter Sellers is Chance, a TV-watching gardener who spends his whole life just \"being there\". In a scene whereShirley MacLaine is crying, he says \"I understand\". We know that he just says that because that would be the typical thing to say, but Shirley MacLaine thinks he really understands. When Chance gets asked about a subject he knows nothing about, he starts talking about gardening, which is mistaken for metaphoric speech.  At the end, he has appeared on national TV and is famous. He doesn't understand why, or even what it means to be famous, or wise, or anything at all. He just does whatever he somehow (probably by the TV) has been trained to do. Being There is one of the few movies that says a lot by being quiet. There is never more emphasis on some scenes or lines of dialogue than others, and almost like Chance the Gardener, it doesn't seem to notice its poignancy.(\"The Truman Show\" is an example of the opposite of this.)It just tells a story that's poignant. Being There does have some flaws, though.

In A Life Where We Are All Caught Up In The Rat Race Of Paying The Bills, Keeping A Job, Worried About The Weather Or A War, Or The Billion And One Things That Keep Us Too Confused To Remember The Most Important Thing About Our Lives ... It Doesn't Matter Who We Are, It Doesn't Matter Where We Come From, What Are Religious, Economic Background Or Ethnic Background Is ... The Only Thing That Matters Is That We Can All Be There For Someone Else And That In Being There We Can Make A Difference In Someone's Life And They Can Make A Difference In Our Lives ... \"Being There\" Is A Little Known Piece Of Art And I Am Thankful That I Have Seen It And That I Can Appreciate The Nuances That Make It Such A Fascinating Film ... I Can Honestly Say That My Views On My Life Have Changed And Are Better For Having Met Mr. Chauncey Gardner ... \"Life Is A State Of Mind\" ...",

His facial expression would kill at poker. Then to have the acceptance of his reposneses to questions of economic and sexual direction are dynamic in their simplicity. This is what makes this movie and the role worthy of my ten rating. The premise of having Chance interact with the President and becoming the confidant of a wealthy adviser allows for the viewer to see from Chance's perspective. We ask ourselves, how much simpler does meaning have to be? Why do we have to over analyze every aspect of our lives and issues? Can we be as direct and sustain an Chance?",

Sellers' character \"Chance/Chauncey Gardiner\", has been separated from the outside world almost completely, his only window to the world being TV.Once evicted from his home for life, his naivety does not get him killed, rather, it advances him in the world - and his social standing quickly elevates.The point that the director may be trying to make, that modern Western society has lost it's innocence and sense of priority, is a little tired, but it does not detract from the overall viewing as there are many interesting and humorous moments. Sellers' portrayal of \"Chance\" is worth the viewing, if nothing else.It does drag at points, and I found the character of \"Ben\" quite dull and in a sense more naive than \"Chance\" - something intentional I suppose.",

Something much more accurate and simply relevant than Forrest Gump. Being There is a story of a simple-minded Gardener who isn't smart enough for the livelihood in the country but his simple thoughts on Garden caring makes him the most philosophical man in the country. Media, political People and VIPs fall over his simplicity and quotes. Such heart warming film that also makes you to learn something about the life is important in Cinema world, rather than just seeking for entertainment. Hal Ashby delivers a Classic emotional comedy drama with high rate of accuracy. This is something that came 15 years before Forrest Gump and still doesn't have a loophole or big mistakes to be forgiven. Peter Sellers has given a Legendary performance, i can give it another watch just to see Mr. Chauncey Gardiner. This is a compelling drama that serves Simplicity, intelligence, basic morals, friendship, love, attraction, popularity and what not in just one narration, such a great writing it is. Also the supporting cast seems flawless whether it is Shirley Maclaine or Oscar winning act by Melvyn Douglas. In a nutshell, Being There is deep meaning human drama that plays with sentiments without being dramatic. If you liked Forrest Gump then try this old wine and let me know the taste. I heard many people don't know about this film so now it's my job to make it popular in my list at least, i can call myself lucky now.\nRating- 8/10*",

Upon a meeting with the president, Chancie is mistaken for a genius when his own simple mind-spun philosophy is taken to be thought-provoking political points and so becomes a media and political sensation overnight. \nThe amazing and wonderful thing about Being There is how the many laughs and similes all come as a natural result from Sellers' peformance, without the script, star or direction bringing this all out through slapstick set-pieces - where such a character like Chance could easily be milked for.  Instead, its all to do with our own perceptions -how we see people and interpret their behaviour differently.

He was unable to obtain backing for it until near the end of the decade - a fact we should all be thankful for.Being There is the story of Chance, a simple middle aged man who has lived his entire life within the walls of a NY house owned by a mysterious figure known only as the old man.  The film suggests that the old man was once quite rich, but in fact lives a fairly modest existence in what is now a rather poor neighbourhood.When the old man dies, Louise, the housekeeper and Chance, the gardener, must leave the old man's house.  Chance begins to wander the streets and has several hilarious encounters along the way.  He finally encounters socialite Eve Rand near the end of the day.  After being injured slightly during their encounter, Rand insists Chance return home with her to be seen by a doctor. This sets the premise for the remainder of the film... Chance answers every question (except those he fails to understand well enough to answer at all) with a gardening reference...  this is mistaken for brilliance by nearly everyone around him.  The simple Chance's response to \"modern life\" are fabulously funny... This, coupled with the occassional cut back to the poor Housekeeper Louise's home - showing her contempt and disgust that a mere idiot could rise so highly - lend a wonderful context to the film.Made near the end of Sellers all too short life, Being There ranks with Dr. Strangelove as perhaps his best.

Sure I accepted the premise as the critics had explained it, that Chauncey had an impressive demeanour...trouble was he didn't do anything impressive that I could see...he just sat there looking spaced out, while all about him, apparently intelligent characters were hanging on his few words...if we were to view similar scenarios in real life, we'd assume it was a case of ordinary people humouring one who was developmentally challenged.Real people never for a moment would have discerned a normal I.Q. in this man, let alone \"profundity\". The doctor was supposed to be the most perceptive, but in the real world, people assume that people who utter only other's ideas, have few original ones of their own..there's a crude but apt saying \"B.S.baffles brains...\" as well as the more civilized exhortation to \"Blind 'em with science.\"My point is, that if I wanted to portray sophisticated folks being taken in, I'd do it in a script with a torrent of manipulative words, not a few inarticulate sentences. A far better example of \"fooling some of the people...etc\" is the old Tony Curtis film \"The Great Imposter\"(?)The irony for me is that this film \"Being There\" could have worked...I happen to believe that one CAN be \"educated\"by extensive watching of t.v...even if an absorbent mind can't learn from yer average soap opera(which is what our own lives are, anyway, if you just think about it) there's always PBS,or the BBC!If they had made Chauncey in the image of a bright bloke,who had learned the rudiments of learned discourse from t.v. then the character would have rung true for me, while still remaining faithful to the spirit of the  film, which is the conning of \"our betters\" or, at any rate, those who should know better. What was portrayed, in fact, was a scenario in which we're asked to believe that a naif could con these here con-artists (which every successful businessman, and politician has, necessarily, to be).If I had been the producer of \"Being There\", my hero's character would have been based on the persona of - I'm not kidding - Al Gore!..or, to a lesser extent, Bill Clinton.Now, no matter what one may think of them as Presidential timbre these men are undoubtedly impressive, onscreen, and I suspect, even more so in the flesh. They, certainly, seem to know what they are talking about,(even if they don't, which I doubt), and they don't confine themselves, to a few wise-sounding saws. Of course, I'm well aware that they gained their erudition the hard way, college, politics, Governorships, etc, and that they're, indeed,solid, intellectually but I hold that if Chauncey had been half as smart as they, to begin with, he could have assimilated their  aspect of a man of accomplishment merely by watching lotsa t.v. Thus he would also have fooled me - and I'm a sophisticate, 'cos I DO watch a lot of television.!",

He was nominated for an Oscar and BAFTA, but he did win a Golden Globe for his extraordinary performance of a man who spent all his life at home not reading, not writing, having meals made for him, and all his learning comes from television. He also has a keen interest in gardening, which is what confuses people to believe his surname is Gardiner. Basically when going out of the house, for once, Chance is injured by a car belonging to Eve Rand (BAFTA nominated Shirley MacLaine), daughter of dying Benjamin Turnbull Rand (Melvyn Douglas in his second Oscar winning role, also won a Golden Globe). He lives with this family and immediately has people talking about how considerate and understanding he is, but he obviously hardly has a clue what's going on. He even meets the United States President, 'Bobby' (Jack Warden) in the process. Also starring Richard A. Dysart as Dr. Robert Allenby. Filled with both funny and touching moments, and a good representation of how near idiocy can help others, this is great. It won the BAFTA for Best Screenplay, and it was nominated for Best Film, and it was nominated the Golden Globes for Best Director for Hal Ashby, Best Screenplay and Best Motion Picture - Comedy/Musical.

No prerequisites, no preamble, no understanding of what might happen, just pure discovery. Peter Sellers plays Chance the gardener, a stand still kind of guy in a rapidly evolving world. One morning his daily routine is disrupted as someone dear to him dies. The man he lived with and worked for all of his life has passed on and now Chance must deal with it. As the story develops he moves forward with his unchangeable characteristics. Like a man on an escalator who thinks he's using the stairs.From a quiet life as a gardener he transitions smoothly into his next setting, the realm of politics. Unbothered by it all he maintains his disposition and goes through life now as he did before.Though the plot transitions do not seem to be thought out or emphasized, I choose to interpret this as a positive. Most times that producers or directors attempt to explain transition, they end up muddying the plot with unnecessary information. This story is plain, pure and understandable for what it is, a quiet comedy with an overarching theme of blissful ignorance.I look forward to researching more films directed by Hal Ashby after watching this.

When his boss dies and the maid moves out, Chance must leave the estate for the first time in his life. He is picked up on the street by Eve and moved to a villa of Ben, a millionaire. Chance's words of emptiness reach almost a suggestive level making Ben and others think he is an intellectual speaking in metaphors. Now people see everything in the empty Chance...It's always interesting for me to remember how I reacted when I first saw a film which later advanced into one of my favorites. \"Being there\" is one of those films. I remember not wanting to see it because I didn't like Peter Sellers, but when I did my opinion changed for 180 degrees. This movie is magic, Sellers portrayed the retarded hero Chance so gentle I couldn't help myself but feel sympathy for him and the story is so humane and emotional it really deserved all the prizes it got ( nomination for a \"Golden Palm\" in Cannes, 2 Golden Globes, 1 Oscar ).--------- What is the message of the story? Well, since Chance is always talking nonsense while all around him people are interpreting his words for clever metaphors ( when he is saying how the elevator is \"such a small room\" everyone thinks he's joking, when the president asks his opinion about the economy he starts talking about how \"some plants grow better in the light and some better in the dark\" making Ben think he is talking about the ups and downs of the economy ) it's obvious the theme is the tragic realization that people only see what they want to see. Only the old maid complained how Chance's messages are nonsense, but nobody paid much attention to her. Of course this is unrealistic, since it's a satire about human ignorance. Truly, who is dumber: the dumb Chance or the people who are following him and not realizing he is dumb? This is a funny film, but at the same time a sad one, since it makes clear that we will never get to know each other and find out what's really going inside of us because we are always shallow and looking only what's on the outside. As for the final scene, the one where Chance is walking on water...I guess it's a metaphor itself showing how people don't know NOTHING. The only things they know are the ones they believe they know, and then they become real. It just shows that the world they live in is extremely false and even if Chance wasn't smart he would be proclaimed smart in history because people made their mind upon it, placing individuals on high places although every person is equal. Truly, human stupidity is all mighty.As for the film's message about life: we worry too much about everything. But most of the things that happen, happen by outside forces and chance we can't control. Maybe that's why Chance is so fascinating: he didn't care about money, romance, prestige, material things...he was just satisfied by being there. Grade: 9/10",

Without giving away too much of the film, the plot concerns a gardener named Chance who has taken care of his employer for much of his life. The problem is, he has never seen much of the outside world except through what he has seen on television. He can't read, write, drive a car, or do math. He doesn't have a doctor, dentist, family or any friends for that matter. Then suddenly, and without expectation, he is thrust out into the outside world. Then, the movie takes an interesting turn in which we see his social standing rise, and rise, and rise... The theme of BEING THERE is that much of what we see in people only has the appearance of reality. Our candidates seem to have a good comprehension on various issues but do they really understand what they are saying? Great political figures seem to be experienced but do they have a realistic understanding of the world? Does much of their rise to power have more to do with the inner workings of other powerful figures rather than what the people decide? Does our hope for the progress of America overshadow the blatant flaws in those who lead our country? All of these questions are related to BEING THERE and Peter Sellers' character. By the end of the movie we understand that Chance is not a bad person, he's...well...just there (hence the name of the movie). It took me a while to understand what the surprise ending meant. It is another take on the main theme but presented symbolically. In any event be prepared to find the same theme apply to religious figures as well. \"Life is a state of mind....\"",

The same can be said for Chance the Gardner, or Chauncey Gardiner as he comes to be preferred. If there is ever a case of the worst snubbing of Academy Awards for any actor then it is for Peter Sellers in Being There. Awards have been given for performances with less vitality, and Sellers gentle interpretation of the central character lay the blueprints for the likes of Dustin Hoffman in Rainman, or Tom Hanks in Forrest Gump. Both these actors won Oscars and Sellers was snubbed. His performance is less exaggerated than both Hoffmans or Hanks's but no less enjoyable, and for what is quite a restrained character for Sellers usual belly laugh characters, i was on the edge my seat throughout.The fact that nothing is really revealed about Chances background lends a touch of the mysterious to the character, there is something that is just a fraction untouchable about the character, and Sellers performance. I for one am convinced that Chance is actually Timeless, perhaps even not of this world, much like Stan Laurel, whom Sellers performance echoes. Whoever Chance is, Sellers really can walk on water. Shirley McClaine is fantastic as the boozy wife of Melvyn Douglas. McClaine brings a sense that even though hers and Sellers characters are a million light years away in intelligance, in spirit they are soul mates. Melvyn Douglas's performance is heart breaking, and well worth the Academy Award he won for the role. Hal Ashby handles the direction with a stilted calmness, but the movie comes across as being somewhere between a Laurel and Hardy movie and Its A Wonderful Life. In truth, watching Being There is similar to seeing a firework display going off through thick snow.What really lets the movie down is the inclusion of out-takes played over the end credits. These are a nasty way of seeing Chance come to life and almost dispel your memory of Chance. If it was another Actor other than Sellers in the role it would have killed the character for sure.Getting There is half the fun. Being there is ALL of it.",

Even today, when it is apparent that Ronald Reagan was beginning to suffer from Alzheimer's Disease during his presidency, no thought seems to be given to reinterpreting his utterances in that light.Being There was first-rate political prognostication.

Sellers sleep-walked through his role and the movie is so pedestrian in every way, it remains one of the all-time movie-related puzzles for me. Every time I see it mentioned I shake my head in disbelief that anyone could still be promoting this flick as worth seeing.  Now, Two-Way Stretch, there's a good (and funny) Peter Sellers movie!

            "content": "The 1970s was really the decade where politicised and philosophical filmmaking coincided with the mainstream. And it wasn't all intense soap-boxing or avant-garde nonsense. There was also a lot of stuff that was simply reflective in tone, gentle in its message and on the viewer. Such a picture is Being There.Being There is adapted from a novella by noted left-leaning author Jerzy Kosinsky, and although it does feature a rather obvious but never openly clarified lampooning of the business and political elite, it has broad appeal because its main story is a very touching one of human frailty and innocence, its plot sharing many similarities to that of Edward Scissorhands. Unlike the mechanical creation Scissorhands, Being There's Chance is a man who has lived all his life in isolation, but he has in common with the later hero that his exact nature is not entirely clear. Chance has some features of autism, such as his tendency to take things literally, his apparent lack of feeling towards others, and his good memory for detail. I wonder if Kosinsky had some experience of autistic people, even though Chance's condition is not truly like autism, and Being There is a far cry from the largely realistic portrayal in Rain Man. The fact that all the various businessmen and politicians mistake Chance for some kind of financial prodigy puts the story into the realms of fantasy and of satire.This was the final screen appearance of comedy genius Peter Sellers, and also his first attempt at a dramatic role, albeit not a very conventional one. As Chance Sellers really constrains himself, keeping a cool and placid veneer at most times, then displaying the character's emotions in odd little bursts. And like Dustin Hoffman in Rain Man, he has an entire demeanour that is completely apart from the rest of humanity. But unlike Hoffman's careful study of extant figures, Chance's manner, his odd ways of moving and speaking, seem to be of Seller's own invention. It's a masterpiece of a performance. His life would be tragically cut short within the year, but he could hardly have ended his career on a more perfect note than this. Sellers' co-star is Melvyn Douglas, a handsome and talented lead man of the 1930s, who sadly never got the accolades he deserved until later in his life. Douglas gives an amazing performance here, verging from larger-than-life theatrics to a realistic portrayal of a dying man, above all giving a heart-warming and lovable impression of a man who has come to terms with his own fate. The performance has a certain truth to it, because like Sellers, Douglas would also be dead a few years after the movie's release.Being There was the last great picture directed by Hal Ashby, one of the key figures of 1970s cinema. At a time when cinema was drowning in an excess of showy technique, Ashby's style was one of elegant simplicity. There are few camera moves, but everything is there in the arrangement of the shot. In the earliest scenes of Being There at the old man's house, he makes Chance's environment seem confined without appearing oppressive, the d\u00e9cor dark without being dingy, the light at the windows bright but indistinctive. The world outside seems wide open and colourful by comparison, even if it is surprisingly grotty in contrast to the womb-like interiors we saw before it. Another example of Ashby's intelligent use of space is in the shot of the presidential bed, the framing with the two huge lamps at either end creates a kind of optical illusion that accentuates the frigidity of the situation. Ashby is also the master of the subtle, unintentional-looking touch that adds a little extra depth to scene and character. For example, when Chance is at the TV studio, at the end of one shot a man walks the other way carrying a bunch of flowers. An innocuous extra like any other it seems, but Chance is briefly distracted by the blooms, and it's another tentative reminder of his personality. Here and there throughout the movie Ashby will also throw in the beauty of a winter landscape, appropriate to the tone of the piece. Ashby suffered a number of career setbacks during the eighties, descended into drink and drugs and never made another really satisfying picture, and so never enjoyed the longevity of contemporaries such as Scorsese and Spielberg.No-one could have known at the time that soon after Being There was released Sellers would be dead and Ashby would be washed up. But it seems that the picture achieves a sense of melancholy and inevitability that is very fitting for the circumstances of those two figures who were central to it. Cinema, it seems, can imitate life in more ways than one. However, as Chance would say, the winter would not last forever. Every death and downfall in screen history gives way to a new springtime of budding talent and beautiful filmmaking.",

            "content": "This movie is so well done. A real work of art that is moving, thought provoking, entertaining and hilarious. Not many films can claim that. Mr. Ashby works wonders with an wonderfully imaginative and darkly comic story by Jerzy Kosinski. Ashby allows us to see Chance through the eyes of those around him who all imbue him with their own ideas about the intent and meaning of Chance's enigmatic sayings and behavior. We are also allowed periodic moments into the mind of Chance in very subtle ways through the wonderful cinematography by Caleb Deschanel and the haunting and delicate music by Johnny Mandel.Ashby doesn't spoon-feed the viewer with his own point of view but rather allows us to see what we can. Almost everyone I've ever heard talk about this film has found their own unique take on it. This is a testament to the high caliber of film-making on the part of everyone involved in \"Being There\".The acting is incredible. This is an excellent cast of veteran actors some of whom give the best performances of their careers. Melvyn Douglas is superb in his Oscar-winning role as Benjamin Turnbull Rand. Severely underrated Jack Warden provides comic relief as the befuddled \"President Bobby\". Shirley Maclaine gives perhaps the best performance of the film playing straight-man to Peter Sellers captivating (can we call it a performance or...) incarnation as Chance. Shirley has the daunting job of having to work off virtually nothing and imbue Chance with the great depth of wisdom and sex appeal that she is supposed to feel from him. She really is amazing at walking the fine-line in playing both the comedy and the pathos of this very frustrated and lonely character of Eve. On first viewing of the film it is obviously Sellers amazing portrayal that deservedly dominates the film. But in seeing the movie over the years I've really come to appreciate Shirley's great work. Richard Basehart is wonderful as Vladimir Skrapinov, who along with Peter Sellers and Melvyn Douglas all gave us one of their final film performances. The whole ensemble is really perfectly cast and terrific in their respective roles.What can be finally said about the master craftsman, Peter Sellers who gave the greatest performance of his incredible career. A strange man who really brought a very difficult role to life. The film would never have worked without his artistry.",

I loved to see all kinds of pretentious people pretending to understand what Chauncy was talking about and to know their destiny, but ultimately Chauncy is just there and he probably is the happiest.  He doesn't know that he can't walk on water.  He has always been in perfect harmony with nature and thus with himself.  The rest of the world hears (interprets) from his mouth what they WANT to hear and construct consequences themselves.  That's why Chauncy can be of help to everyone. Maybe that's why fortune-tellers CAN be of help to everyone too: they make universal statement in which anyone can fit their own situation/character/problem.Cinematographer Caleb Deschanel (the Right Stuff, the Natural) saved more than one film from oblivion, but in this film he is just another guy who makes the film an icon in history of cinema (although technically it is not surpassing in any way).  The other guys are Hal Ashby (Last Detail) whose masterpiece it is, and of course Peter Sellers (Pink Panther, Dr. Strangelove) with his brilliant sober part that should have won him an award.  Johnny Mandel's music may be a bit nostalghic, but it's constantly natural and never sentimental: it never takes over control.

Peter Sellers is a comical actor that I greatly admire, especially as bumbling police officer Inspector Clousseau from \"The Pink Panther\" series. And his transformation to morph into three different characters in \"Dr. Strangelove\" is absolutely hypnotic and was absolutely hilarious in \"Lady Killers\". However,there were a few stinkers that he has been, that I regretted ever seeing. \"Being There\" marks the last film of Sellers' career and came out shortly before his death in 1980. What's flabbergasting was that this film was on the sidelines for about nine years and Sellers fought hard to have this film made. This movie is probably one of Sellers' best performances as he plays a more restrained character as opposed to the slapstick roles he's famous for.Sellers plays the role of Chance, a simple-minded gardener who lives in a townhouse of a rich, reclusive millionaire. Chance hardly ever leaves the home as he has free food, free bed and access to their television that he watches quite frequently. Suddenly, his master/mentor dies and now Chance has no alternative but to go off on his own and fend for himself. Homeless and no direction to go, Chance encounters a gold-digging socialite named Eve Rand (Shirley MacLaine)who is wed to an aging business tycoon name Benjamin Rand (Melvyn Douglas Oscar Winner for Best Supporting Actor)and they take the simpleton to their estate, because they think he's a bigwig in the upper class. During his stay he leaves a lasting impression on these upper class civilians even the President himself (Jack Warden). The message delivered in \"Being There\" tells you that people only listen to what they want to hear over what needs to be heard. The incoherency between the characters was brilliantly exhibited and I was impressed that the novel it was based on by Jerzy Kosinski was depicted fairly accurately. For that reason I give kudos to Hal Ashby for his wonderful direction by creating Chance as both a sorrowful soul and at the same time, not too sugary of a character. This defines that wherever Chance goes or what he says, people will listen because they mistake him for a sophisticate and this happens throughout the film. The acting is overall genuine gold and when acting is executed immaculately, I rate films higher than those that are bad or mediocre. Sure Sellers is the best actor in the story, but everybody else supported Sellers very nicely and didn't try to usurp him in any way. I highly recommend you go and see it. For the excellent direction, the brilliant star quality and a change in character for Sellers going from slapstick comedy to a more subtle low-key comedy with some drama involved.",

I was forced to watch \"Being There\" in my Artistic Experience class in my college.  I slept through the whole second act, but that was mostly because I didn't get any sleep the previous day.  But then I checked this movie out again at my campus library, and I was struggling to keep myself awake--only this time I was well-rested the previous day.  My professor discussed the many symbolisms and insight delivered from the movie, and I think that's about the only thing this movie is worthy of.  It's worthy of discussions in art and film studies classrooms.  This is yet another artsy-fartsy flick that has very little entertainment value.  There's a few funny sequences.  I like his use of the catch phrase \"I like to watch\" in the face of the homosexual man offering to have sex with him and in the face of Shirley McLaine who eagerly wanted to make love to him.  But overall, the film has such a humdrum tone that you wonder if they keep a videotape of the movie in dentists' offices to put their patients asleep while they're giving root canals.Peter Sellers gives a surprisingly excellent performance, but good acting is not always a sufficient compensation for a story as dull as this. I'm sure the arthouse crowd will appraise this movie for years to come. However, some movies never seem to transcend their artistic pretentions, and leaves the audience hung out to dry.  This is one of those movies.My score:  3 (out of 10)",

            "content": "Lot's of people were raving about \"Being There\" when it came out. But when I saw it, in a movie theater, I didn't get it. I do, now. This is one of those rare movies that benefit from being seen with a DVD player, etc., because it gives you time for the movie to sink in, for you to grasp what the director is doing. This is not a movie centered on a plot.There are plenty of positive reviews here on IMDb, many raving about Sellers' skill as an actor in Being There. But to appreciate his acting skills you need to see him in a range of movies. A good place to start is The Lady Killers, both because he is teamed with Alec Guinness, and because it is perhaps Sellers' least dynamic role. You feel like this was the \"real\" Peter Sellers back in the 50s, chubby and not too bright. Yet Sellers transformed himself, both by loosing weight and learning to act. He also followed in the footsteps of that master actor, Alec Guinness. Like Guinness, he went on to play multiple roles in a single movie, and to become a screen chameleon, who became a different person with each movie. Guinness's triumph as an actor was mastering the art of silence, delivering a powerful performance even while saying little or nothing. Smiley's People, A Passage to India, come to mind. Being There was Sellers' homage to Guinness's art of silence. And this is what makes Being There so fascinating; Sellers demonstrates that he is a truly great actor by finding precisely the right expression and gesture for the situation, even while he says as little as possible, often as slowly as possible. He is manipulating silence and time with his acting, bending it around him, while the wind-up automatons around him skitter hither and thither. But this is not to diminish his earlier roles. Sellers was far more than Inspector Clouseau. Look at the earlier Lolita for a jaw-dropping performance you would assume had been filmed 20 years later. In The Party we see some of the naivet\u00e9 of Chance. And, of course, there is Dr. Strangelove, a multiple role acting tour de force.For the moviegoer who has \"seen everything,\" it is a treat to see a concept as original as Being There. While there is a Christian allusion at the end of the movie, there is more of a Buddhist quality to it, the idea of emptiness and silence as enlightenment. We would see a very clever retooling of this concept of the idiot saint in Forrest Gump. And there was an antecedent in the much earlier \"Harvey\"; in all, something, perhaps a guardian angel, seems to protect the pure of heart fool. There is also a Robert Altman non-plot quality to the movie. Sure, this is a one trick pony that is stretched to its limit. At the heart is the old saying, \"Better to keep your mouth shut and have people believe you a fool, than to open it and remove all doubt.\" And there is the obvious saying, \"The clothes make the man.\" But it is the movie's very audacity that makes you want to see if they can carry it off. There is more meaning to the movie than that, of course. Different people will see different things in it. With a great work like this, it is foolish to try to draw out in words a message that is better expressed by the film, itself. And there is the lovely Shirley MacLaine, a very talented actress. I wonder if her performance could have been stronger here? But if it were too intense, it might have overshadowed Sellers. The spotlight had to follow him around. As to the credits, Sellers was absolutely right. The outtakes weren't even funny. I guess this was the blooper era. These bloopers should not have been attached to the movie, and should never have seen the light of day.",

Sellers was strengthened in his performance by the fellow actors. Melvyn Douglas gave an outstanding portrayal of the powerful government official on his death bed and his final scene with him and Peter Sellers was deeply moving. Shirley Maclaine also deserves credit for her emotionally unstable role that she must have put her heart and soul into.The whole plot was cleverly put together, it really goes to show how far innocence and misinterpretation can get you. Especially as it is set in a time where wisdom has become a nothing, being set in the post-Vietnam era and as the old fashioned ways of law and order are drawing to an end. This film also reminds you that it was at the end of the Peter Sellers legacy, as he died shortly afterwards.

This is really a very simple film but it's (in the main) beautifully told and beautifully portrayed. Sellers performance is delightfully balanced and strikes the perfect chord between fool and simpleton. Only the cut of his wardrobe disguising his real origins. In many ways his portrayal is similar to the character he played in \"The optimist of Nine Elms\", and if you enjoyed this film, you'll enjoy that one to.

Soon, Chance inadvertently finds himself poised for greatness in the world of politics, oblivious to his surroundings all the while.To call Sellers' next-to-last performance brilliant would be stating the obvious.  What he does rather than act is take the most difficult situations and find the simplest and most oblique observations about them.  Chance is the child in all of us, and Sellers creates a character who takes people at face value, not judging or condescending, and with a bland smile simply observes.Douglas and MacLaine are brilliant as always and director Ashby hits just the right note of simplicity and somberness.  Robert C. Jones' and Jerzy Kosinski's script is the brilliant springboard from which events take on a life all their own.  And, instead of a movie ruining the printed word, it gives them just the right air and essence to make even the most unbelievable events make perfect sense.I won't spoil the ending, for those who haven't seen the movie, but it gives the movie just the right spirit to end on.  It makes perfect sense.Ten stars for \"Being There\".",

Although, it does not drive me emotionally, it provokes a sense of intellectual fever that gives me great pleasure in myself, my life, and my abilities to discern  the meaning of life.The last narrative line in the movie, \"..life is just a state of mind.\", simply, but exquisitely, describes my relationship with, and organization of, perception, as I understand it.Each of us casts our environment and the actors contained within, onto a stage that presents our own life as a screenplay. We see ourselves, quite often as the central characters, and thus, we  situationally define the other players, in order to refine the central theme that we believe is the story of our life. We see in others those attributes and actions that enable us to understand and relate to ourselves.\"Being There\" was not meant to be a photographic representation of the premise that Kosinski presents. I believe he intended to exaggerate, perhaps to better illuminate, his view of human perception, in order to make clear, to a wider range of readers, what he saw in his own existence.I suspect that Sellers saw this application of the idea in his own life and was driven by the need to express himself through Jerzy's words and his own actions. Sellers was 'taken' with the story for over ten years. It was more than just a movie to be made. It was, I believe, Peter's testimony to his own life.Each time I see the movie, I get something new or refreshing from it.

            "content": "A quiet film of subtle humor that manages to keep its delicate mood until the very end. It is full of scenes where just a tiny little slip would be needed to turn it into something crude, to ruin it; but the slip never occurs, fortunately. All actors shine - of course especially Peter Sellers, who fully shows what lies at the heart of his acting for the first and, sadly, the last time. What made his Hrundi V. Bakshi in \"The Party\" interesting, what Inspector Clouseau? A certain detachedness, an air of not being fully in the world at times, whether shown in the calm, friendly Bakshi who unintentionally transforms the world around him into a state of chaos, or to a lesser degree in Clouseau, who is fully part of the chaos. The gardener Chance in \"Being There\" is the personification of this detachedness, distilled, concentrated, and entirely convincing despite the improbable story.There are, however, three little things that irritate me: 1) The outtakes under the end credits. They are a nuisance. I read now that Sellers requested to remove them. He was right. It is a big error to show them there; at least they should have been moved after the credits. 2) I don't see the purpose of the scene with the homosexual. It ends abruptly and doesn't contribute to the story. Why is it there? As a preparation for Chance's later \"I like to watch\" in the bedroom scene with Eve? It would not be needed for this, he could still say it exactly the same way. Not a big irritation - the scene just seems not really pertaining. 3) My impressions of the last scene, Chance walking on water, are ambivalent. It could be seen simply as symbolizing the line \"life is a state of mind\" - he doesn't know that you can't walk on water, so he just does it. Or it could be seen as presenting us Chance as an angel, perhaps even Christ, which would also further improve the story's plausibility - if he is sent by higher forces on a mission to save the world (or the like), it is no longer unclear why everything goes so improbably well for him. However, in any case: unfortunately, this walk on water has a slight touch of cheesiness. It is too direct. The film would do well without it. I imagine Chance just walking around the pond and returning to the funeral, standing there. Being there.",

It becomes not so much a matter of how obtuse the Sellers character is, but how totally credulous and unbelievable the rest of the characters are. Not for one minute did I believe any of their reactions to Sellers beyond the first few encounters.

She was most beautiful and believable in her attempts to deliver a distraction for dear ol' Chance.Political figures perennially provide fodder for mindless creature exposition, but this vehicle exudes an inordinate sorrow for this career path.

            "content": "This film has many funny moments, but none of them are those 'laugh out loud' types of laughs. Most viewers will chuckle along with the premise as the story proceeds or just grin to themselves, recognizing the sly commentary on our modern institutions, our monuments of power, and on ourselves - the stumbling deluded humanity which surrounds itself with pomp and circumstance, as it has dating back to the Egyptian monarchs and the Roman Empire. Here it's modern America. In this satire, an obviously retarded man (Sellers), completely naive and helpless, manages to overwhelm all the bastions of power, up to and including the Presidency. How is this possible? As the story moves along at a leisurely pace (though never boring to those who can appreciate the joke), we come to realize that the central character (Sellers) is surrounded by a special aura. He is always in exactly the right place and the right time, so when he says the things he says - simplistic jargon - the timing creates a meaning for the listeners, a very special, insightful meaning.Some, a very few, manage to circumvent this aura eventually, for reasons unclear. Maybe these individuals have no real wants or needs for themselves. They're, shall we say, completely satisfied or at peace with themselves - no insecurities, perhaps. One example is the character of the doctor (Dysart), who glimpses the truth about Sellers' character early and soon uncovers it all for himself. But most of us, the film says, are very needy indeed. We hear want we want to hear, to make us feel better, to create a more tolerable world for ourselves. In this story, that includes the President of the USA (Warden), so insecure he rejects his wife at night until he hears the right tones of approval from Sellers. Until then, he's a mess. It's all very amusing, especially as other characters in the Washington DC power structure create even more elaborate fiction about the Sellers character when no factual information can be found.Are we really so deluded? Perhaps. Or perhaps the film is warning us to avoid such a path, or face Armageddon. There's a slight chill to the last scene at the funeral, when you may realize this is a dark comedy, after all. In any case, Peter Sellers is almost unrecognizable in this piece. This was his next-to-last film and, in one sense, a crowning achievement. He conveys so much with so little and truly shows us all what a talent he was, so different is he here from all the other characters he'd portrayed for the previous 20 years. It couldn't have been mere chance, could it?",

            "content": "An amazingly wonderful possibility takes root and grows in the most unlikely setting imaginable. What emerges is a truly witty and triumphant story. 'Being There' allows us to look at what we have become as a society and tears down the ladders we are expected to climb. What is left is a revealing look at the common denominator and the math involved in obtaining it. Along the way, it becomes clear that friendship, understanding and love are unaffected by the simplicity of one's actions. Indeed, we find that it sprinkles the pathway with a chance to read one's intent not through words, but by thinking, searching one's eyes and trusting our instincts.Peter Sellers is deeply entrenched in a character that may be the hardest role for someone of his intellect, oratory gifts, and physical presence to inhabit. I am not sure that I have ever seen a film that so brilliantly uses reactions as a major part of the script. This also makes for hilarious 'what if' scenarios. Sellers' talent for this goes without saying. He is joined by an impressive array of old Hollywood talent who compliment his every gesture.Melvyn Douglas rightfully earned the Oscar for his portrayal of Benjamin Rand, somewhat of a J. Paul Getty industrialist who has one foot in the grave and the President's ear as well. Shirley MacLaine is wonderful as Eve, Rand's devoted but antsy wife. Ms. MacLaine is always a good bet to take over any film she is cast in, and she steals several scenes. In one, she leaves us rolling on the floor laughing.Jack Warden builds a role as the crafty and cranky President into a fine performance. Initially, it appeared that he would be used sparingly, but his subsequent scenes were very good. Ruth Attaway portrays Louise, a woman burdened by the truth, yet rightfully embittered by it. Richard Dysart provides intrigue as the skeptical Doctor Allenby.'Being There' was directed by Hal Ashby. He was afforded an excellent script, cast, and crew. I think one of the reasons that great actors require great directors is due to their immersion into their roles. Mr. Ashby had the ability, as they say in sports, to 'see the whole field'. It was an essential ingredient to making this a classic film. The movie was filmed in 1979, and there is much to date it. Yet, the core elements are timeless.The movie is now on Blu-ray. There are a few extras, such as memories of the filming, an alternate ending and deleted scenes. It does look nice, but do not expect the normal HD experience. It was filmed almost 30 years ago. However, I sent this to the top of my Netflix list on the strength of its story. That and a message that I need to be reminded of from time to time when life seems absurd.

First of all, to that guy from Jersey who reviewed below calling it \"artsie-fartsie\" and \"boring\", I will direct him to the Jerry Bruckheimer section, so he can receive the mindless shallow entertainment he's looking for.  If your favorite movie is \"The Rock\", then by all means pass this one by.The early scenes are really the best comedy in the film.  Sellers on the streets of DC, the elevator jokes, and of course \"Would you like a car, sir?\"  Many other reviewers have remarked on the themes of this film, the commentary on media and politics.  To my mind, it all comes down to the same point: the unnecessary complexity of people's relationships with each other and with society as a whole, especially their disingenuous nature.  The viewer is made to feel a little like Holden from Catcher in the Rye, having the phoniness of the world paraded in front of us by the contrast between the simple gardener and the pretentious characters around him.  Of course, as all the different people around Chance interpret his words to suit their own ideas and expectations, anyone thinking about this film could take something different from it.  That may be an irony that this film's makers would enjoy.As an aside, I enjoyed some of the symbolism in this film in light of having taken a class on the history of conspiracy theories. Watch for the Illuminati symbolism as a small group of men decide the future of America.Overall, an excellent picture, though unable to maintain the comedic elements to the end.",

            "content": "SpoilerThe film `Being There' starring Peter Sellers is very intriguing. It tells the story of a simple minded gardener who having always lived within the walls of his master's estate knows very little of the outside world. He only knows what he has seen by watching television is the house and by working in the garden. When his master, possibly his father, it is never revealed, dies he is forced to leave the estate and find a new life in the world he doesn't really understand. He soon meets the wife of a very wealthy and influential business man who has connections to the President of the United States when her car accidentally hits his leg. He soon becomes friends with the wealthy man and even the President. His simple minded comments about how life works in the garden are mistaken by most as the profound metaphors of a genius. He becomes famous and is highly regarded by many people. This film is similar to `Forrest Gump' and `Rain Man' in that a simple minded person leads an extraordinary life and is believed by many to be profound.This movie is full of symbolism. It is no accident the Seller's character's name is really `Chance.' Everything that happens to Chauncey in the movie seems to happen pretty much by chance. He stumbles through life not fully understanding anything that is going on around him. However, just by chance, he is seen as fully understanding and his simplicity is mistaken for true genius. The movie can be seen in a few different ways. Chance could be Jesus figure that is here to speak to us in simple yet profound ways and to guide us through a tough time. The final scene would seem to indicate that this metaphor is definitely possible. The movie can also be seen a commentary on society and its leaders. At the end of the movie, the men carrying the casket are even considering having Chauncey run for President of the United States. It shows how it could be possible for an otherwise very unqualified person who is accepted just because of the people that they know or are associated with. Many people feel that a lot of politicians are not very intelligent or accomplished at all but get to high levels of government because of who they know. This movie's satire is witty and intelligent. It really makes you think about what life would be like if more people would focus on just `being there' instead of always trying to get somewhere in life. Chauncey always just lived in the moment; he didn't really have a yesterday or a tomorrow that he worried about. The end of the movie definitely causes people to react. It changes the whole way that you look at the movie. Many people see that God or Jesus figure, others see the walking on water as a way of showing there is no limit to what you can do if no one tells you that you can't do it. I think it shows that we find whatever we seek in religion or in politics.This movie does a great job of making you think deeply and laugh at the same time. It may have many different meanings to many different people, I feel it all depends on your frame of reference.",

He has the education of a very small baby, who has developed no further than the 13 channels he chronically watches on TV. He marvels at the sight of African-Americans out in the real world, and can't hold anybody's gaze when a TV is switched on. \"Yes\" and \"I understand\", said with the priceless Seller's straight face, are the most frequent phrases from the guy's mouth.Through chance (ironically the name of the character), he ascends to the heights of the Washington DC intelligentsia as a result of his simple-minded musings on gardening, which are mistaken for a mysterious economic expertise seemingly channeled straight from the common American. After the President cites his gardening tips as national economic policy during a major speech, Chance then becomes the most powerful man in the nation.There is a racial component to this movie which I found compelling: he was raised and taught everything he knew by a maid who happened to be African-American, who, when discovering the nincompoop was embraced, celebrated, and rewarded with money and fame, let out the quote which is the title of this post.Spoiler: the last line of the film is \"Life is a state of mind\". This is the antithetical end to the eulogy given at the funeral for the rich man Seller's has mesmerized with simpleton charm. This line is delivered in stark contrast to the images the film has shown of poverty and plight for those less fortunate and not lucky enough to be born wealthy and inherit influence. That he was so duped by an idiot gardener into mistaking absolute retardedness for brilliance is, I believe, a central premise to the film. Undereducated and lacking any skills, Chance still was embraced by the elite. It would have never happened without his seasoned image.This is a film about distinctions.I've always been a fan of Peter Seller's work and thought that under the surface of most of it he looked for a deeper social meaning...see \"Dr. Strangelove\" for his crown jewel character...but this movie will probably have me thinking about race relations for some time.",

            "content": "Chance (Peter Sellers) is a mentally challenged gardener who has lived an isolated life at a rich old man's Washington house watching TV. Then the old man dies and Chance is thrown out onto the street. Eve Rand (Shirley MacLaine)'s limo bumps into Chance and mistakenly calls him Chauncey Gardner. Her husband Ben (Melvyn Douglas) is a powerful but sickly businessman. Dr. Allenby (Richard Dysart) treats Chance and tells him to stay for a few days. Nobody is able to read Chance correctly. Ben sees Chance as an insightful fellow businessman. Chance accompanying Ben meets and even advises the President (Jack Warden). When the President quotes Chance on TV, he becomes a sought after man.Chance is kind of a Forrest Gump figure except this isn't that funny at all. This is a slow quietly quirky movie. Peter Sellers delivers a very deliberate and mannered performance. The main difference between Chance and Gump is an inherent goodness in Gump. Chance is more of a blank canvas that the other characters sees as their reflections. It's just not quite as effective. It's an interesting performance but not necessarily a compelling one. As for the politics, it felt very simplistic. The film may be trying to deliver some insights but I don't think it's as insightful as it wants to be.",

            "content": "Although I was able, in some abstract and diffuse manner, to recognize the quality of BEING THERE when I first watched it at the age of 15, I was not afraid to confess that I probably didn't quite grasp it then. Having recently given it another try (approaching 22) it turned out a completely different experience altogether; the humor, the social confrontations, and especially the indelibly subtle performance of Peter Sellers: it all appeared so much more clear to me now. The natural outcome of having a few more years of experience on your back than before? Perhaps, but I imagine that also older and more experienced parts of the audience would benefit from giving this film several viewings. Although the story is really very simple in essence, it is explored in a way which makes it multi-layered, providing nuances which one single viewing won't reveal.Based on the novel by Jerzy Kosinski, Sellers is reported to have tried for years to convince the author that he would be right for the leading part of Chance the gardener in a movie adaptation, until the film finally came true. When it did, Sellers was actually approaching the end of his life; although being only in his fifties, his failing health made him appear considerably older, and this would be the last film of his to be released before his death. Not least for that reason is it touching to affirm that his performance as Chance may be said to be his crowning achievement, rivaled only by his work in Kubrick's DR. STRANGELOVE. But although incredible and unforgettable in and as Strangelove, Chance provided Sellers with an opportunity to showcase his talent for more subtle aspects of human behavior (and humor). As Strangelove, and other characters such as Inspector Closeau, Sellers had to a large degree played \"improbable\" human beings, whose burlesque behavior and characteristics made them fit more into the world of traditional clowns than the real world; only with his extraordinary gift was it possible to make these characters appear human and somewhat believable after all. Chance, on the other hand, is not a clown in such an inevitable manner; his uncomplicated and childish mind is, in fact, mistaken for being a mind of genius. For that reason, he is the biggest clown Sellers ever portrayed; the consequences of his existence do not only lead to people getting physically hurt, such as with Closeau, but to the entire population around him becoming clowns themselves, as they are unable to recognize what person they really are dealing with.In order to create the character of Chance, Sellers was reported to have combined the basic characteristics of two persons who intrigued him while growing up; an actual gardener whom his family knew, and comedian Stan Laurel (of Laurel & Hardy). His use of typical Laurel-mannerisms is often striking, although to me, the one character which may be mistaken for being Chance's twin brother is another, even earlier comedian of silent films named Harry Langdon. Although Langdon was, like Sellers with Chance, very much an adult by the time he established his character, his trademark was to portray a thoroughly bewildered and innocent child man, a seeming an alien from another world. One difference between Harry and Chance was that Harry never found himself mistaken for being a genius...You'll find yourself discussing details from this movie over and over again, with yourself or other viewers; what does it mean that Chance walks on water? Or does he...?",

            "review_title": "Brilliant, Touching, Maddening, Saddening: Extraordinary.",
            "content": "\"Being There\" is the story of a simple-minded man named Chance. He has had no exposure to the world his entire life, save for the four walls of his master's estate, the garden he tends to, and the things he sees on TV. When his master, \"the old man,\" passes away, Chance is let loose upon the world where his gentle, slow, and simple demeanour are mistaken for the thoughtful musings of an eccentric genius. With a sharp script that never preaches, this is satire at its best, and the performances are thoroughly moving as the film's reputation leads one to believe. What might surprise you, as it did me, is the film's poetic, and beautiful cinematography. However, I find this a difficult film to judge, as given its confounding status as a comedy, I found myself sooner driven to tears and anxiety than to joy and laughter. I don't mind that the film explores the full spectrum of emotions, I just wish that the experience hadn't been so one-sided.The premise of the film - a simple man accomplishing extraordinary things - will be familiar to those who have seen the higher profile film, \"Forrest Gump,\" a film whose similarities and dissimilarities to \"Being There\" I will explore later. The protagonist, Chance (Sellers), no doubt lives up to his name, as he is a victim of circumstance and coincidence. The only clothes he owns are antiques that happen to be back in fashion, and the body he occupies of a middle-aged man provides him with the unintentional guise of a distinguished, well-educated, and wealthy economic savant. He happens upon a rich woman and her husband, who also happens to be a well-regarded presidential adviser. When he introduces himself for the first time through a bout of coughing, the couple mistakes his name for Chauncey Gardner, and he accomplishes more in a matter of days under that alias than anyone could have dreamt for Chance the gardener. His influence becomes contagious, and even has a stake in the political arena. The script is satirical, ironic, cautionary, critical, and sharp. Rarely does it falter.Sellers, as Chance, is the soul of the film. It's a brilliant performance, and one of the best ever captured. He is joined by a plethora of great supporting actors, including Shirley MacLaine and Melvyn Douglas, who are all aided by Hal Ashby's poetic direction, and the startlingly haunting cinematography of Caleb Deschanel. Ashby's world is one of pastiche, ass-kissing, and shallow surfaces. Unfortunately, each supporting character is made to be one of these types in some form or another, save for one character whom I will not reveal. Douglas and MacLaine exude boatloads of emotion, but as they are equally fooled by Chance's unwitting con as anyone else in the film, there's a certain shallowness that leaves them disappointingly empty. Given the context of the film (especially the last shot), this may be deliberate, but it is never the less dissatisfying, and also leads me to the film's one major flaw.Unlike the aforementioned \"Forrest Gump,\" no one in the film is aware of the fact that Chance is far from a genius; in fact, that in itself is a rather generous euphemism. Chance doesn't know that he's different, and neither does anyone else around him. It's the risk that at any moment the charade might implode that makes this film such an anxious and painstaking experience. \"How will they react,\" you ask yourself, \"when they find out they've all been fooled?\" We learn early on that Chance is completely dependent on those around him; his very survival depends on the kindness of others, and how charitable could they possibly be when they realize the truth? It's this anxiety, and the spectator's omniscient perspective (we're in on the joke) that often dulls the humour. As such, watching Chance is like watching a lost puppy navigate traffic: he is a creature obliviously in control of everyone's life but his own. This is not to say, however, that \"Gump\" is the superior film. On the contrary, \"Being There\" trumps that film on every artistic level, but \"Gump\" benefited from coming second so that the master could not learn from his student.In the end, \"Being There\" is an extraordinary feat on the levels of artistry, performance, writing, and satire. Though its comedic ambitions fall a little short, it is a film that you absolutely must see. To paraphrase the film's protagonist, you'll like to watch.",

            "content": "Jerzy Kosinski, writer of the novel and the screenplay for \"Being There\", apparently drew a lot of his inspiration from Shakespeare's \"A Midsummer Night's Dream\", including the play within a play, \"Pyramus and Thisbe\". The story does not follow the plays exactly; it adds some marvelous twists and turns of its own. Note the repeated symbolism of walls and gardens. And, per Maruice Hunt of Baylor U., the loss of individual identity in the Shakespeare play; to this I will say that individual identity is recovered ultimately in \"Being There\" -- for better or worse.The story pulls elements from both plays. From \"Pyramus and Thisbe\", star- crossed lovers are separated by a common wall between the individual houses in which each of them lives. They plan to meet at Ninius' Tomb, to elope and escape the fighting of their parents that has kept them apart.From \"Dream\", there is Puck Goodfellow\" who erroneously distributes a magic love potion to young lovers, in so doing confounding all the relationships among them. The lovers wander about a forest inhabited by the king and queen of the fairies and their retinue. NOTE: Puck, also known as Robin Goodfellow, is sometimes depicted as a rustic, simplistic, goat-legged faun or satyr, playing a \"Pipes of Pan\".Chance, as a childlike Puck (Robin Goodfellow) is freed from the walls of the house and garden in which he has lived since childhood, and wanders into the \"magical\" world outside, bringing a TV remote with him as a symbolic Pipes of Pan. He seeks an actual garden (forest) in which to fulfill his calling as a gardener in rustic simplicity. Instead, he finds himself in a boundless \"fairyland\" (symbolized by Washington, D. C., and the Biltmore Estate of Asheville, N.C.). In effect, he finds equivalents of the King and Queen of fairyland, and their retinue, in the swirling forest of politics and economics. All these remarkable people are confounded by this enchanting world around them, yet they begin to think sensibly as Chance gives them simple ideas about what works and does not.Instead of confounding all these wonderful people, as with magic, he enthralls them with his simple pronouncements about gardening.Getting back to \"Pyramus and Thisbe\": A tomb figures large in the story line. Pyramus and Thisbe are to meet at Ninius' Tomb. Certain business associates meet at a certain tomb in the movie as well. Do they symbolize the \"clumsy, rustic folk\" of that play who perform their roles so badly that instead of a classic tragedy, they come up with something foolish that is best forgotten?An excellent range of scholarly reviews of the novel by Jerzy Kosinski, and the movie, can be found in Wikipedia's posting on \"Being There\". I have drawn some of my comments here from those reviews, and also classic mythology as well.Yet, let us remember that as Puck says about \"Dream\", \"We are such stuff as dreams are made of, and our little life is rounded with a sleep.\" Here's hoping you enjoyed the movie.

However, a chance brings him to the house of the rich man with a great influence on the government. His childish simplicity, unburdened mind, literalism, and directness in address, combined with a calm appearance and complete absence of complexes and shame, are somehow misinterpreted as the manners of a wise and intuitive man who is at peace with himself and the world around him, and he is inadvertently involved in politics, to the extent that the president himself quotes him in his speeches.\"Being There\", directed by Hal Ashby, is a political satire, as well as a satire of the influence of the media on political and public life, achieved through the comedy of the situation. Humor is intelligent and subtle, mostly verbal, although there are some almost Chaplin moments. It is based primarily on the simple and literal boyish observations of a gardener, which people in his environment, unprovoked, interpret as profound metaphors, so he becomes the object of admiration and respect, and even romantic love. This is not a comedy that will make you scream with laughter, while tears well up in your eyes, but you will smile pleasantly all the time.The cast presented all the characters very naturally and convincingly. Peter Sellers was nominated for an Oscar for the leading role (many believe that this is his life achievement), while Melvyn Douglas won it for a supporting role. In my opinion, the rest of the cast does not lag behind the leading duo, and I would especially like to single out Shirley MacLaine, who deserved at least a nomination. The same goes for Jerzy Kosinski, who, for this occasion, adapted his own novel of the same name into a film script.Although the story takes place slowly, the film does not stifle, but maintains a well-balanced pace, which allows us to fully experience what we see and hear, and excellent photography, directing and editing make each frame pleasing to the eye.Finally, I just want to go back to Sellers for a moment. It is interesting, and perhaps it has a deeper meaning, that he spent almost a decade trying to find a studio to produce \"Being There\", in the meantime filming the \"Pink Panther\" series in order to raise money to finance it himself. In 1979, he finally made it and died the following year ...9/10.",

While I felt that film rang a little long, and that its best parts were in the beginning, from a technical standpoint the film was flawless.  The Satie theme was perfectly blended into an eclectic score, the camera work was poetic but objective enough not to intrude and the acting was superb.  Peter Sellars gave one of his best performances as the dim-witted but well meaning Chance and Shirley MacLaine did a great job opposite him.  But now down to the meat-and-potatoes of the film.It was difficult for me to watch not because Chance was so pathetic, no, it was everyone around him; the dolts who bought into the myth and who took the accidental charlatan to be authentic.  Chance might be one of the most honest characters ever portrayed on film (without Jimmy Stewart's `aw shucks' persona of course) but it's everyone around him who irritated me and made viewing this film for the first time a difficult task.  Like The Seventh Seal every type of person is portrayed in this film: nihilists, cynics, innocents and others who `go with the flow.'  And I guess the question that Kosinski left us to painstakingly ruminate, is, which one of these is Chance? As the ending would suggest, Chance was a prophet or someone endowed with divine powers.  Chance is the ultimate anti-martyr; his martyrdom comes in the form of success, not self-sacrifice.\nLike A Clockwork Orange and more prominently, Taxi Driver, Being There chronicles the ascendance of an accidental hero.  We are only left to wonder about the kind of destruction (or salvation?) that will come when Chancey Gardner (a man whose existence is based entirely on conjecture and the projections of those around him) is elected president, as the ending suggests.  Like an innocent Jay Gatsby, Chance is a character who has no idea of his destructive abilities; the fact that people begin to take him seriously threatens the existence of the institutions in which he is involved.  Yet the question remains, is he so destructive? We would think that since he was a fraud, no good could come out of his faux position, but as the movie progresses we see that he is but a figurehead, a puppet clandestinely controlled by fat cats, albeit the same fat cats who would be controlling the country anyways.  Chance is just a new face, someone to whom the clueless population, someone who likes to watch TV.\nThe only voice of reason in the film is Louise, and for her, he serves as nothing but an illustration of subjugation.  I guess the biggest question of the film, and the one that I can't even begin to fathom, is how can such a nothing become something? This film's answer is simple: Chance.",

I remembered loving this film and seeing it again just reminded me of how good films can be. Hal Ashby and Jerzy Kosinski find the perfect balance of humour/satire and feel-goodness. It's easy to forget how brilliant a writer Kosinski was. His book \"The Painted Bird\" is one of the most harrowing stories ever told. In many way the movie \"Being There\" is much more satisfying than the book and with much more heart. It's as if honing the book down distilled the story to its essential and made it all the more relevant for it.The one \"movie\" moment that is just too heart wrenching is as Rand passes. Sellers lets out a stifled gasp, the kind I've only heard when someone is really crying and holding it in. Devastating...",

While these people may be mythical and somewhat child-like, they do carry the core of humanity at its finest.  It must have been a tough character to portray.  Most viewers can't imagine a soul like Chauncey wandering through our society invisible and unaffected by our most impressionable expressions.  To think his education came from a TV is alien.  The rearing from his companions in his home was a big segment omitted from viewers.  Was this guy retarded or something?  I liked it anyhow.",

            "content": "More admirable than enjoyable, this is probably Hal Ashby's most heartfelt film. It is easy to see where the director's sensibilities lie in his presentation of an innocent childlike creature being treated as some Jesus figure by the American establishment, all the way to the top. But, for me, as well as the charm and not so subtle suggestion that everyone prefers a fool to an intellectual, there are a few too silly moments here. Against all the sycophants of silliness there is a single scene showing the black maid, back now in her own home, and watching TV and denouncing the rise of the simpleton as something only a white man could do. This moment of sanity pairs nicely with an earlier episode as the Sellers character emerges onto the street for the first time and gets a sharp bite of reality from a group of black youths. Setting aside Ashby's attempts at political comment I have to say that Sellers' performance is amazing and especially for someone so reliant in the past on funny voices this near monotone child-like delivery is excellent and coupled with his strange and imitative mannerisms quite remarkable. Shirley MacLaine is also very good as chief admirer and would be seducer. Not being completely sold on the idea, I found I was well ready for the end and then found the 'walking on the water' moment less than effective and the sequence beneath the credits with Sellers breaking up as he struggled to deliver the black kids' message most embarrassing.",

IT HAS SO MANY FACETS THAT THERE ARE AN ALMOST INFINITE NUMBER OF ANGLES YOU CAN LOOK AT IT FROM AND SO MANY OF THEM ARE PERFECTLY VALID\"                   \"AN ABSOLUTELY BRILLIANT FILM\"POSTSCRIPT:One thing there appears to be a lot of confusion about is the meaning, symbolism, and interpretation of the final scene. A lot of people who otherwise liked the movie had a problem with it. I did not.\nHere is why: \"This scene is just as improbable as the rest of the movie, but it is, in fact, plausible.  You must understand that one could easily appear to walk on water simply by finding a frozen pond after a good rain and venturing out on the solid ice surface but with your feet apparently on water.\" I THINK THIS SCENE SUMS UP THE WHOLE MOVIE PERFECTLY - as apparently Hal Ashby accidently realized it would at the last minute. (Please refer to \"How the last shot got made\" by Noah Veil (dare2b@earthlink.net).)I BELIEVE THE SCENE SAYS: IF YOU CAN GET AWAY WITH WHAT CHAUNCY DID YOU CAN PROBABLY EXPECT TO GET AWAY WITH JUST ABOUT ANYTHING - JUST BYUH - CHANCE. AND THE MOST WELL KNOWN THING WE ARE NOT SUPPOSED TO BE ABLE TO DO IS TO WALK ON WATER. BUT IN FACT - REALLY YOU CAN - under the right, however improbable or even ridiculous circumstances.

As Chance says it all the time I like watching TV!(in fact the character reminds me of myself a little bit!)All of a sudden when the townhouse owner passes away Chance is put out to pasture on the D.C. streets, it's here by a chance encounter oddly enough that his life changes forever when he runs into a limo! Upon this happening Chance is taken in by a Washington power couple they are business brokers Eve(in one of Shirley MacLaine's best) and Ben Rand(Melvyn Douglas)and things change as Chance has now been cast away from the TV and into a world of power, comfort, and meetings of the well to do all of it is connected to political people too. As again by luck and chance it's thru Chance's words that he's learned from TV that make him respected by you guessed it the president(Jack Warden)! Believe it or not Chance is now a political adviser! Overall as Chance would say you'll like to watch, as clearly \"Being There\" is an excellent movie a satire and great spin that proves life opens up when you meet new people and experience places outside of one's sheltered cell and it proves that life is always about luck and you guessed it chance sake!",

These two descriptions preceded my viewing of Being There. I have seen the film twenty times since and I definitely agree with the former. What Peter Sellers does is so wonderful you may miss the point if you don't look closely. He took years to convince the writer Jerzy Kosinski that he should play the part. The role was a kind of summary of whom he had wanted to become towards the end of his life. His annihilation of all things involving responsibility and accountability had a deep resonance with the ailing, impatient actor. He believed it was his best role as did many of his friends and colleagues. Chauncey Gardener's reactions and reasoning are so simple and minimalistic; and that's where the comedy comes from. It isn't really a funny movie but it is hilarious. It is a serious movie but not to be taken seriously. Shirley MacLaine and Richard Dysart are also magical.

The passenger of this limousine is Eve Rand (Shirley MacLaine), a wife of an old, rich businessman Ben Rand (Melvyn Douglas). She decides to take Change with her to her mansion, where she has a doctor looking after her dying husband.The dying man and his wife mistake the quiet, simple gardening advices spouting Change as a man of deep insight. This leads Change to meet the president of USA, who in turn is quoting the gardener in a TV. And Chance is happily oblivious to all this, when everywhere around him people think him to be a kind of a savant.The first half of the film is quite slow, taking its time to show us, how departed Chance is from the reality, when he tries to change the channels of reality with his remote, when he meets something he's not comfortable with. The second half introduces the Rand's and how they take Change in as their confidant and possible heir to Ben's emporium. In the last half Change becomes a political effector.Chance works out as a mirror in the story, but kind of that doesn't show us what really is, but what we wish we could see, just like people don't see Chance, but what they think he is.You can draw what you want from the story. It doesn't underline anything, but it gives a variety of possibilities of what Change really is, or is he really a thing. As the final line in the movies go, life is a state of mind.

It takes a keen mind to see so far past the usual Hollywood movie-rubbish and see {Being There} as the ART that it truly is... even Dustin Hoffman couldn't believe that he won his Oscar (for Kramer vs. Kramer) over Peter Sellers' incredibly amazing performance. Simply put, this is inane and silly comedy at it's best - yet it is everlasting and timeless among the great satiric films in movie history. Take for example \"the awkwardness\" of the scenes. The writing, direction, and performances all purposefully add to that strange feeling as you watch it. And it is |precisely| the awkwardness of those scenes that make this movie so brilliant. In addition, the sheer stupidity of the movie characters -who are so naively and easily taken in by such a simpleton as Chance the Gardener- could be seen as a valid commentary of 'the power' of the TV/movie screen -- and it's mesmerizing effect on people. My grandfather called the TV (one of which he never owned) THE IDIOT BOX. In \"Being There\" Peter Sellers shows us just how easily 'normal people' can be taken in by 'the box'!The last great scene in this movie has the line: \"Life is a state of mind...\" that phrase was put on Peter Sellers' tombstone when he died a year later. A fitting tribute to both him and this truly great film. Don't believe it?

It stars Peter Sellers whom I love in the \"Pink Panther\" movies, and enjoyed in \"Dr. Strangelove\" and \"Lady Killers\", but there're a lot of his movies I don't like. I've found that, unlike Robin Williams, Peter Sellers seems to work best with directors that keep a tight lease on him and have a clear vision of their own. This movie came at the end of Peter's career, and he fought for nine years to get a studio to make it. I believe that it's his best work. Sellers' character, Chance, tells the plain and simple truth throughout the movie but everyone hears only what they want to hear. The lack of any true interaction between the characters reflects my own warped vision of the world and I marvel that Jerzy Kosinski's novel was able to make it to the screen. For that, I have to credit the director, Hal Ashby. He manages to show Chance as both a simpleton AND an innocent, but not an object of pity - something that is very hard to do. As the story unfolds, every life touched by Chance is enriched, as each character mistakes him for a genius. We, the audience, smirk knowingly as we watch the same mistake take place again and again, until the final scene where we become humbled and delighted at our own preconceptions. Every time I watch this movie I marvel at how much raw talent parades across the screen. I love acting when it's done well, and it's done very well indeed in this story. Everyone in the cast is fantastic, but they never eclipse Sellers. So I guess what it boils down to is: this is a great story told by a great writer and brought to life by a great director. The entire cast shines, but Peter Sellers goes out with a supernova.",

            "content": "Only watched this as it was on the Empire 500 list and caught my eye.Love the way Chance impresses the higher echelons of society by appearing to be wise when he is generally clueless. The general message is that you can be stupid and successful if you are white, dress well, speak well and slowly and are extremely composed. He is like a hollowed out perfect and fearless executive.Some people do see through this (certainly Eve and Dr Allenby) and he almost gets caught out / in trouble on several occasions. Its all highly unlikely and satirical but its sort of a mass hallucination rubber stamped by Benjamin Rand; he appreciates him for his honesty and others follow.Peter Sellars is amazing and its hard not to feel for him as he sets out on his own for the first time. He could easily have starved to death without the assistance of others.My guess is he has a type of autism. He is extremely calm and well spoken and his general cognitive ability is not consistent with someone illiterate.There are a few amazing scenes; one that grabbed me was when Mr Rand was using a dictaphone (which must have been rare in those days) to manage his stocks and assets. When he switched to a conversation about Chance, this input continued, with his words being echoed on the screen in a HAL like fashion.Shirley MacLaine is so seductive in this film; her behaviour is timeless. Her relationship with her husband is complicated and though loving, now appears open and non-sexual. I was touched by her relationship with Chance but it was not that persuasive.The whole support cast is wonderful from Benjamin Rand, his doctor to Jack Walden who played the President.My interpretation of the end of the film is not supernatural just a look at the world through Chance's eyes. Somehow I felt a little cheated there were a few ends I would have liked to have seen tied up",

You might be tempted to compare this flick with the usual comedies with funny coincidences and misunderstandings. However, this movie enables you to see a deeper meaning.For instance, Mr. Chance manages Benjamin R. to lose his fear of death. See, this is what I like about this movie; on the one hand you can argue that Chance is just dumb and Benjamin is fooled by not seeing the narrow-minded Chance. On the other hand, Chance can be considered a polite, friendly listener Benjamin has been looking for throughout his whole life.Moreover, there is the fascinating change in Chance's personality. At the beginning, you get to know the person who has not left the \"old man's\" house for his whole life. Later, he realizes that life can be more than just what is displayed on the TV-screen.It would be surprising for me, if anyone did not be happy about Chance's luck. This is, because he has never fooled anybody on purpose and always says the truth. All in all, \"Being There\" might not be as exciting as some newer comedies.

Chance's thick-headed mumblings did not enthrall me nearly enough to accept the incredibly implausible premise that everyone from the President on down could consistently mistake his vapid remarks as profound pearls of wisdom. The message of the movie was perhaps an interesting one and was not lost on me - the movie had a lot to say about how self absorbed we can become, and similar commentary about the nature of politics and the modern media. But to hear Mervyn Douglas and Shirley MacLaine constantly rave about what scintillating company Chance was - well, that's asking a lot of even such talented actors. The film is not without its moments - in one monumentally absurd scene Chance manages to add \"good lover\" to his constantly growing repertoire - but overall left me squirming with embarrassment and disbelief.",

He is befriended by Eve, the wife of a wealthy political heavyweight, and both take to his simple, direct and honest approach to life. Chance meets the President, and soon is being mooted by the powers that be as a candidate for the highest office ...This is a lovely, gentle, slow-paced comedy with a deceptively brilliant central idea; everyone imbues Chance's words with their own meaning, when he simply speaks literally all the time. But beyond the amusing misunderstanding of course there is a much deeper theme, which is that simplicity, honesty and candour are forgotten virtues, especially amongst the media powerbrokers of Capitol Hill. Chauncey may be an idiot but he is happy, fulfilled and knows who he is, unlike the rest of the people in this movie. Sellers is pretty unforgettable in this; his performance is stiff and restrained in a way that perfectly fits the role and he never once breaks character simply to get a laugh. He has a haunted aspect and looks older than in all his other films (he was 54). The supporting cast are excellent and the film is very elegantly shot by Caleb Deschanel. It's hard to find fault with this movie because it's quite unique and was obviously made with loving care, but somehow it never really involved me in a big way. Maybe on some level the story isn't tenable or the political setting bores me, or perhaps I didn't like the sheer volume of TV sound (a key aspect of Chance's personality) which crashes into the mix. For whatever reason though, like Ghandi or The Last Waltz, this is a very good film that just doesn't hold my interest enough. Don't miss the last shot though, which is one of the subtlest, most memorable and funniest in any movie. Based on a book by Jerzy Kosinski.",

I would rate his performance here second only to his work in Dr. Strangelove. Shirley MacLaine is perfect. Melvyn Douglas and Richard A. Dysart also give standout performances.This film does have problems. It is at times frustratingly unrealistic. Chance's competence level seems inconsistent. Sellers appears out of character in places, and the score is intense where I feel it may have worked better to create a light mood.The score and heavy cinematography undermine the film's overall comedic effect - was it intentional? Most of the material is light comedic fare and yet stylistically the film is often very dark (Kubrickian). I laugh more while reflecting on the film than when watching it. I guess I'd say the effect is disconcerting, like the idea of Chance the Gardner for President or as a Christ-like figure.. just like a billionaire Bill Gates, it would be funnier if it wasn't so patently unjustified.Where the film works, it really works. Sellers outshines Tom Hanks in the Forrest Gump depatment, with a much more subtle and charming take on the simple mind. \"Being There\" manages to be genuinely thought provoking, as opposed to incessantly hammering you over the head with it's message the way so many modern films do. Chance may walk on water, but the filmmakers leave it up to those of us who can sink to explore what's beneath the surface.

A personal project for the star, it took nine years for it to reach the screen, and wouldn't get the greenlight until the \"Pink Panther\" series was successfully revived in the 70s.Certainly Sellers is well showcased here, in a film scripted by Jerzy Kosinski from his own novel. Sellers plays \"Chance\", the lifelong gardener for an aged gentleman. Simple-minded and childlike, all he knows of the world is what's he's seen on television. And then he is just *thrust* into the real world when the old man dies, and he's ordered to leave the residence.He \"chances\" to meet important people, all of whom truly appreciate his straightforward and unpretentious manner of speaking. And nobody is the wiser, for a long time. People like wealthy political kingmaker Benjamin Rand (Melvyn Douglas, winning his second Oscar) come to trust him and regard him as a friend. When he rises to a position of national prominence, people like the President (Jack Warden) are flummoxed that they can't find ANY background information on him.Much of the drama and intrigue arises from the way that characters *react* to Chance and *interpret* the things he says. When Chance offers his opinion on the economy, which he knows nothing about, he puts it in terms that he understands. And others come to regard it as near-brilliance.Sellers is wonderfully appealing in the lead, receiving excellent support from Warden, Douglas, Richard Dysart, Richard Basehart, David Clennon, Fran Brill, James Noble, and others, with Shirley MacLaine absolutely radiant as Rands' much younger wife Eve. Of course, since the idea of human sexuality is almost completely foreign to Chance, he doesn't react the way that Eve expects when she acts on her attraction to him.Filmmaker Hal Ashby added another gem to his resume with this likeable fable, which holds interest throughout and offers plenty of humor, while delivering an unexpected and interesting final shot.Well worth your time, especially for any fan of the cast members.Eight out of 10.",

He can't read or write and is \"short-changed by the Lord and dumb as a jackass\". His window to the world is the TV, which he enjoys to imitate, other than that he is nothing more than a walking mirror: flat, reflecting what everybody wants to see in him, talking back what they want to hear. The gardener Chance - or, as some who misheard like to call him, Chancey Gardiner - is just there, in suit and tie, an empty mind, alas, sans garden. But being there is enough if you're in the right place and actually are as shallow as others consider you profound. Filmed right Jerzy Kosinski's engaging novel makes the perfect mix for a highly intelligent, though intentionally slow comedy for those who like to have it the more thoughtful way. The film benefits greatly from Peter Seller's complete immersion in the straightness of his character, which is arguably his best role. And Eumir Deodato's version of Strauss' \"Also Sprach Zarathustra\" as he steps out of the house for the first time in years is nearly as striking as when Kubrick opened \"2001\" with the original.Unforgettable is the superb ending, which breaks out of the comedic back and forth and goes a decisive, daring step further. It reminds me of another king of comedy, Bill Cosby, and the joke in his stand-up routine where he relates that he wasn't quite sure about his name when he was little. Quite often his parents used to shout out when they saw him: \"Jesus Christ!\" In the same innocent way our gardener Chance appears to the viewer as the savior himself when the movie ends and when we can still hear the film's final message ringing in our ears: \"Life is a state of mind.\" Well, and ignorance is bliss.",

The trick is very simple and that makes this film a great comedy. We believe what we want to believe. This is the case of the mass media and the ordinary people in this film. And sympathy makes you believe someone. This is the case of Ben Rand (Melvyn Douglas), the old financier. When he heard that Chance had been  forced to leave his master's house by attorney, he believed him because he hated attorney,too. And if your friend believes and trusts someone, you will respect him,too. This is the case of the President(Jack Warden). When he first heard Chance spoke, he felt a strangeness but not enough to doubt him, because Ben believed and trusted him sincerely.This film reminds me of the Eighth Day, directed by Jaco Van Dormael, rather than the Forrest Gump. There are many similarities between Being there and the Eighth Day, but they give us completely different impacts. One is comedy and the other is tragedy. Precisely speaking, Chance and Georges are different. But they act very similarly; meet strangers and change their lives not on purpose.Dormael's decision is the emotionalism. Georges and Harry laugh and cry so straight out that we also laugh and cry with them. In fact I sympathized with them so much that I felt badly sorry for what happened to Georges in the end. I understand this is the one and only choice as long as the director takes the intensive emotionalism, but this is too much, too sad for me to accept.Hal Ashby's decision, on the other hand, is the stoicism. He never allow us to release our emotion. There is no moment of emotional burst throughout this film. This is not an easy way. Success depends entirely on the comic sense. And it does work as I've already pointed first.Ashby has such a clever mind that he takes a comic style to give Chance the chance to live. This makes me very happy.

            "review_title": "Characterization key to a profoundly fascinating film",
            "content": "This film is all about Chance, Peter Seller's character, how you understand this character dictates how you interpret the movie as a whole. Having watched it for the first time recently without reading very many reviews or hearing much about the plot, I was able to interpret the character of Chance considerably different than I have seen done in almost every review I've read of this film.Where in the film does the character of Chance prove his retardation? Sure the woman who raised him claims he is stupid, but this cannot be regarded as definitive. Imagine a perfectly normal person, isolated from culture and society, who's sole occupation is gardening and who otherwise knows nothing except that which is on television. Naturally this person would have very little notion of how the world actually works, how to engage in the culture of the day or how to perform certain societal functions. This lack of knowledge was certainly evident throughout the movie and perhaps gave many audience members the idea that Chance is truly mentally handicapped.But what if he isn't? Maybe I'm simply a victim of the ingenuous Chauncey, but I truly believe that those who slide Chance into the category of mentally challenged are missing a large part of this movie. Think about it, from Chance's perspective what he does is entirely logical. He believes that what he sees on television is reality and when he finds himself engaged in what he saw on television, he realizes that he now is part of that reality. Most importantly he believes that he has the power to change that reality at will, first he tries the remote, but eventually he begins to use the only other tool he has: gardening.From there it is fascinating what he begins to do - he takes the only real knowledge he possesses and applies it to the real world problems he is asked about. He takes his incredible knowledge of gardening and given that simple, yet incredibly deep, knowledge he begins to create a moral framework which drives both his conversation and his actions towards the characters.In this way, Chance's gardening knowledge is really his ethical core. This knowledge centers around a great value for life and an incredible understanding of how that life should be cared for and loved. This philosophy carries over into his \"political insights\" as well as his clear concern for Ben and especially his wife.I think the doctor is the only character who truly realizes Chance's genius despite his apparent duplicity (Chauncey). He finds out that Chance is really a gardener, but at the same time he understands the good Chance has done for Ben in the waning years of his life, along with his wife.Under this interpretation of Chance, the ending makes perfect sense. Chance's fantastic televised view of reality (where anything is possible) combined with his clear sense of purpose (or being?) - as represented by his gardener aspect - create a moment in which Chance transcends our view of reality to discover wholly unknown truth. He walks on water.To me that moment in the film is where the character of Chance suddenly comes into sharp focus. Here is a man who is distinctly separate from society's assumptions and self-imposed limitations and contradictions, yet possessed by a simple love for life which drives his moral being in a direction that society ultimately wants to go. To Chance, there is nothing that can get in the way of achieving this moral goal; like on TV, the possibilities are endless, the impossible possible. Read that last paragraph again. Now tell me you wouldn't want a man like that as president...Clearly this movie is on to something.",

An interesting story felt by me as pretty close because I have lived part of it and because I of my writings make me closer to the protagonist of the film which is beyond good, honest and sincere person. These qualities allow him unobstructed to be liked everywhere and to preserved without changing. Where was he? Close to his heart. We all were honest, good, honest, frank, candid, honest, kind, good at a time but not all these together for very long. These qualities enabled him to win the hearts of his closest ones and create a wave of positive mood behind him, because he was there.The film shows how fake people can be, how many false work they're doing and how they live unusual to them lives. It was a successful joke sometimes hidden behind permanently switched on televisions, may be not always received and understood by everyone.I only think that such a man is more capable to make a woman crazy rather than make her feel more confident and natural. Enjoy watching and look for your garden.http://vihrenmitevmovies.blogspot.com/",

There was a Pink Panther movie done after this that was his last. HOWEVER that being said I totally and absolutely agree with your assessment; this was PS's crowning achievement. For a man who could never totally get out of a role in between movies this one, where he plays basically someone without a personality was the one that reflected the man he truly was. Chauncy Gardner was Peter Sellers without a character to play. Sad and brilliant, there was no one who could have done this better. And yes, he should have won the Oscar.",

How this hopelessly inept and insultingly self-indulgent mess ever got made is a mystery to me: if Sellers really did use his own money to get it into production, then he was clearly far more dysfunctional even than his recent biographers have revealed. From shortly after its beginning, right through to its end, this film is *a wreck*. I am not exaggerating when I say that *not one* of the 'positive' or 'impressed' reactions to Chancey on the part of a character in the 'outside world' was even *remotely* believable: the very notion that any normal person would actually think the central character's stumbling, content-less inanities 'significant' or 'profound' is *absurd* and *insulting*. To put it in straightforward terms: the idea *simply doesn't work*, and the film's pretence that it does is, literally, *stupid*.By the time of its ridiculous and senseless final visual gesture, the film had been in the toilet for more than an hour; the inclusion of 'out-takes' at the very end merely pulled the chain on it. Probably the worst film I have ever seen -- and I've seen some shockers. An absolute crock.Mark D.",

            "content": "What a fantastic piece of film making.I have to admit I very nearly turned 'Being There' off within the first 10 minutes. The desolate setting of 1970s America always makes it near impossible for me to relate to any of the characters in a film. Add to that the presence of 'Louise' (the maid), whom I strongly suspect must be a blood relative of Willem Dafoe's (she's the black female version of the green goblin Dafoe at any rate), and the mistaken comedy-categorisation on this site and you have a challenging beginning.Well I'm glad I stuck it out.This is the original Forrest Gump story, at least on the big screen. Not to disparage the Tom Hanks flick which I also enjoy, but I must say 'Being There' is a much more nuanced film. It's more layered, more human, and consequently humorous in a way that feels more familiar and lifelike. It's funny in a melancholy way with scenes that made me chuckle even after I'd given up on the film being outright funny. The soundtrack is excellent and understated throughout.However. What really made me want to write this review in the first place were the performances. Peter Sellers is stupendous. The mere tone of his voice invites the characterisations that 'Chance Gardener' receives; it's calm and calming, down to earth, honest, understanding and a unique presence. He isn't just being described that way as an overt prompt for the viewer to know how to relate to his character; he inhabits those attributes by his voice alone! We are constantly aware and entertained by his lack of understanding of innuendo; but its the perfect deadpan voice, not in the slightest self-aware. Yet it isn't a one man show either, Melvyn Douglas is an absolute pleasure to watch. He's every bit the stereotypical 1970s capitalist. His policies are despicable, his way of life an affront to any sort of concept of a decent society; yet you can't help but like him because he's so charismatic, so opinionated. Shirley Maclaine does a fantastic job as well; her performance is equal parts touching, sexy, and completely ridiculous, which accentuates the blankness of 'Chance' opposite her. All in all a great film that I'm sure I will keep thinking back to in the next few days trying to uncover further meaning in it's version of (American) life.(I must mention the one grave mistake they make though, is going straight to bloopers as the credits start rolling. it's a very jarring switch of mood that is completely unnecessary (edit: and apparently from reading the trivia page even Sellers was miffed with this decision))",

Silly premise has a gardener (free of heart disease) spending his entire life in a house and developing a hitherto undiscovered form of televisual inspired automatonism, for which we are meant to suspend disbelief purely to indulge someone's liberal prejudices of the Washington elite. A further wretched bit of political correctness has a black housekeeper recognising what white middle and upper classes do not. Also, politicians and the like do not get to the top without a ruthless and astute judgment of character.The lament of the film, that by the time a man gains wisdom it is time for him to die is poignant, but underneath the hospital bed I sense the red flag of socialism being waved. The old man getting in touch with his inner child through Chance as a possible reason for his drift to the center does not convince, not least due to the counter-culture perniciousness that seems to pervade the director's work, a hang over perhaps, from the equally confused, but more entertaining 'Harold And Maude.' The deadening naturalism is the final nail in a coffin already pushed for space.",

            "content": "On personal front I didn't find anything gushing about it, as most of the reviewers here had been (as had been critics too). But then I like things to be simple. Part of a minority, I openly prefer classical, or renaissance over expressionists. This is a movie which can be looked into from quite a few angles,First of course is plausibility - which is very low. Any person in the role of Chance, would be immediately caught. In addition at least a few people knew of his reality (the Attorney, who recognized him too), Louise. There are also unmentioned possibilities. He had been in that 'old man''s home for probably half a century, what about the people who would be coming, at least the post man (alright let us leave him), the gardening input suppliers ? The moment he became a national celebrity, the enigma about his past would be broken. Louise would gossip, as would the others, and press, even on that age, would catch it quick. With that now divorced from my thoughts, I will look at it as an expressionist movie (which, naturally are unnatural depiction of natural, and thus could be defined to be implausible).On that angle, it is allegorical to... what ? Is it religio-philosophical ? Does Chance depict Jesus? Or Adam (with the Eve already named as such, trying to seduce him?) If it was Adam, it has to be pre-apple season, at least he hasn't tasted it yet, Eve definitely has. But Jesus seem more plausible. Coming out of the sheltered garden, Chance walks into the world, of today, where people are more focused on themselves and their personal interests. What he knows of the world of today, is what he has seen from far (in TV), and is really unaware of the human or their behavior per se, under actual stimulus, in fact he is immune to the stimulus when directed at him (Eve)... \"I prefer to watch... {others to do things, rather than make me do it myself}\" ... statement which can be directly attributed to either Morgan Freeman or His son.What Chance says, the fundamental truths, about love and care, is accepted by all, but not in the same sense. Like the Elephant Story, the blind persons (audience) assume it of the Shape they want it to be. Romantics want the nurturing of romance; for businessmen, plants are like their business; for politicians, it is the country; for parents, the children or for teachers, these could as well be the students. The garden analogy fits every walk of life, and naturally his 'profound' philosophy becomes hit. But when all of them wants to make him the \"King\", he walks off, now not taking the Crucification route, but through the water. Probably it would have been ever more apt, had the walking off been on a larger expanse, or even ocean. That is provided the director thought as I see it.Over all, this had been a complicated abstract art. I don't mind that, but the remote-watching part was a bit over stretched, and soon it started being a bit of bore. That is in addition the implausibility of people accepting his actions (only intelligent person in the whole country seemed to be the Doctor). When it stretches a bit, I lose interest.Who was Raphael? The Archangel? I don't think so, quite probably the painter (of Resurrection). Especially if I assume the 'Boy' was Lucifer himself and Old Man- the God, \"Dead, my &&#, tell that &&#, if he has something to tell me, get his &&# down here his'self\"",

            "content": "This rather brilliant dark comedy had so few interesting reviews online I thought I would help it out a bit with my own observations, especially since few reviewers seems to mention the last scene which, to me, is key and shifts the whole movie and its meaning to another level. One can, and should, watch this movie for a variety of good reasons: Peter Sellers' subtle performance, Hal Ashby's quirky direction, or the fine supporting performances by Shirley MacLaine, Melvyn Douglas, and Richard Dysart. First, I LOVE Hal Ashby's classic cult film \"Harold and Maude,\" another dark comedy, so I think I can understand his intent in this movie as well. It's clearly a satire on our modern television saturated culture, so sharp and inclusive that you can see a little Trumpism in Chase's blank canvas appeal to the American political and social elite. I would argue that it is actually more than that and can be seen as a critique of the kind of mysticism where when we go in search of God only to find ourselves.Spoiler alert: I'm about to summarize the last scene and if you haven't seen the movie yet, read this review before watching and mine afterward if you're still interested. A summary of the last scene: Chance (Peter Sellers) is at the funeral for his friend and benefactor, Benjamin Rand (Melvyn Douglas), and he wanders off across the fields in his natty suit as the pall bearers discuss their plans to use him to hang on to power by getting him elected president (like Trump was, some might say). As Chase wanders over hills and next to a pond, fondling a small pine tree and looking around at the garden-a cemetery, don't forget-he turns away from the camera and begins to walk across the water. You know, like Jesus in the Bible? It has become metaphor for doing the impossible. So is Chase a stand-in for Christ or God? To back up a bit, we can look at what other characters are saying about Chase. They project on his rambling non-sequiturs a kind of earthy wisdom. The other characters think his answers on every thing from questions on the American economy to deeply personal existential questions are profound and metaphorical. To them, like Jesus, he speaks in what most people in the film think are gardening metaphors, as in the Garden of Eden kind of garden. The dramatic irony here: we know he's not being profound. He actually is talking about gardening, the only thing he knows. But, much like the human search for meaning where there is none, they project meaning into his garden talk, the long pauses and empty spaces of his utterances. Other events that bring to mind the mistaken God-consciousness are when Ben Rand tells the doctor that he feels OK to die as long as \"Chauncey\" is around. His wife, Eve (another Garden of Eden reference?), has a life-changing orgasm without Chase even touching her when he tells her he \"likes to watch\" and then doesn't, which becomes one of the funniest sex scenes in cinematic history. Notice that each of the other main characters (except the doctor) uses Chase, and his God-like inaction and blank, innocent and strangely inviting stare as a canvas upon which they write their dreams, desires and ambitions. He only reflects, he's not really there. Thus the title's irony. One the few clear-eyed characters in the film is Dr. Allenby, played by Richard Dysart. As a man of science he doesn't quite fall for Chance's empty \"metaphors\" and blank stares as some sort of wisdom. He recognizes Chance for what he is: just a not-too-bright gardener. But at the point where he's just about to spill the beans on Chance, he realizes the old man's fondness for him and backs off of telling him the truth after Rand tells Allenby that he feels OK to die with Chance around. He allows a dying man his comfort, much as any humanitarian would. I highly recommend this film. Its sly humor and ironic tone are delightful and each of the cast members is brilliant in his or her own way. The film is quietly witty and humorous in a way that only a Hal Ashby film can be.",

But the films mood and atmosphere appeared to be two things at the same time. It's both lighthearted and sad, and it does not work to it's advantage. It made me feel uncertain about how to feel, which could have been an excellent tool for a more serious film, but not for this one.My main problem with it is the set-up. Why would a presumably rich man be asked to live with them? Why would the doctor advice it? And how he acts and behaves makes it just annoying that nobody can figure out that he is mentally retarded. The film takes itself a bit too serious for me to overlook this. I suppose this is a social commentary. But whether or not it says that the innocent has the right ideas/morals or if it says that people in general are stupid I'm not completely sure of.For me it was like every laugh brought on a little bit of annoyance and even a bit of sadness. The Sellers character is really a tragic figure, yet the situations he takes part in is too light hearted to make it truly stick.As stated the film does offer multiple good laughs but it never seem to ind it path. Being There balances between calm, nearly dramalike subtleties and Zucker/Brooks craziness. I have to say the subtleties did not work for me. The story was not strong enough to carry it, so these parts felt rather dead. This might seem like an awful lot of negativity but I did like the film to some degree. Sellers does most definitely give a very usable performance and Melvyn Douglas was great. My overall rating is 6.5/10.",

            "content": "Although people seem to genuinely appreciate this movie for its comedy and social commentary, I think there is a third layer of symbolism that is more intruiging and complex than any of the others. Paradoxically, it is a deeply negative commentary, which clashes with the outward comedy of the film. Chauncy Gardner is this film's embodiment of a religious metaphor. To shamelessly summarize a fascinating analysis of religion, Gardner is Jesus. He is introduced to the movie immediately after the man upstairs, God, has died. Once God has died, the movie asks, what then? The answer is a bleak one. Jesus is indeed on earth, and moves around and interacts with the humans, but to what end? As he says, \"I like to watch.\" His power is act is gone; he cannot effect a real change. What changes he causes are not truly his own - his followers act in his name, but not in his ideals. One subtle reference is when the youth pulls a knife on Gardner, and asks him about Raphael, when he is coming. The Archangel Raphael is the angel who is expected to announce the advent of the messiah. Raphael will not come in the movie; the messiah will not come to help the troubled earth.",

            "content": "I wish it had done more for me, but this satirical look at a simple-minded Gardener becoming a well-respected political thinker was a bit mundane. That isn't to say that there aren't plenty of memorable moments and good performances. There are plenty of both. I guess my main problem was with the main character. Sellers portrays him as too restrained, and I was always expecting the script to convince me even further that this man could pull the wool over so many eyes.This is one of the final performances of Peter Sellers who had by this time been reduced to mostly Pink Panther movies. He plays a gardener named Chance who has been sequestered from the outside world since childhood. For years he has only tended the relatively tiny grounds of a wealthy man's Washington D.C. home, never setting foot outside. One day the man's other servant informs him that the old timer has died. Now, Chance is forced to vacate the house and try and find some other place to live or work. The world he steps out into is basically a slum, and he has no clue how to interact with anyone he meets. His only other purpose in life is to watch television whenever possible, and this has led to him speaking in quick sound bites where he basically repeats what he has already been told. A wealthy woman (Shirley MacLaine) hits him with her car, and takes him back to her mansion for rehabilitation. Her husband (Melvyn Douglas) is an incredibly wealthy man on the verge of death. He is so successful that he even has the president's ear on economic issues. The wealthy tycoon takes a liking to Chance, now known as Chauncey Gardiner, and introduces him to the president who begins to repeat what the two men talk about in their first meeting. Before long, people all over the country think this simpleton is some kind of brilliant intellectual whose opinions on just about everything matter.As you can see, this is hardly a plausible story in terms of real world possibilities. But this film and its characters are treated in satirical fashion and they just eat this guys normally useless information up. The film is obviously trying to paint the public at large as lemmings, and there is plenty of evidence that many of us are. The film also seems to be indicting the viewing of too much television and pointing out that it can harm our ability to relate to real people if we watch too much of it. These are valid points, but the film just doesn't seem like it has much else to say. The film looks technically beautiful, as so many did back then, and it has almost a hypnotic effect on the viewer. But I think political satire should be more willing to hit the viewer between the eyes. Bulworth would be a better example of what I'd look for in a satire of this type.The acting is generally spot on. Douglas gives one last fine performance as well, and the always reliable Jack Warden is on hand as the president. Shirley MacLaine took some chances here with her character and they paid off. She's basically a trophy wife who is also finding herself getting older and very lonely for a virile man. Somehow I bought her infatuation for Chance. This was probably the last serious effort from director Hal Ashby, and he comes very close. Just not quite close enough for greatness. 7 of 10 stars.The Hound.",

The direction is by that wonderful technician Hal Ashby, one of the most talented editors Hollywood produced. The skills of these two talented people make Being There an important film. But the one-note Forrest Gumpesque plot is a real disappointment.Sellers is a mentally challenged gardener who has not stepped out of his masters house for decades. His only exposure to the outside world has been through television. When his master dies the simpleton is given eviction notice. He leaves the house and starts walking around town only to be involved in a minor car accident that brings him as a guest to the house of Shirley Maclaine and her dying millionaire husband. He impresses the husband (and in turn the US President) as a deep thinking, calm and very important man. When the President quotes him in a speech, he becomes a nationally known figure.The direction is good and Sellers fits into the role like a glove. But the entire plot is implausible and there is no real humor. Some viewers may find some real meaning in Chauncey's statements and I don't mean to deride that viewpoint. But, I personally didn't and thought that the comedy of errors was based on one-note and continued for far too long. For a real dark comedy, watch Punch-Drunk Love.",

            "content": "Hal Ashby's \"Being There\" is one of the most complex dramatic comedies that I have seen since \"The Apartment\" and is one of the most well crafted and acted movies in the genre. Peter Sellers stars in one of his very best performances (and the one that nabbed him a final Oscar nomination) as Chance a gardener who is illiterate and loves to watch TV that lived and worked in the home of a rich old man named Chauncey Gardiner and his maid named Louise who brought him his meals on a daily basis and when the old man dies at the beginning of the movie she leaves and he is evicted by a pair of lawyers from the house and ends up drifting around the streets of Washington DC with some clothes and his handy remote so he can watch TV from anywhere only to get his leg smashed in between two cars and is found by a woman named Eve Rand (Shirley MacLaine) who convinces him to come to their house for medical attention because a hospital would be too expensive despite never having been in a car before he agrees. When they get to the Rand household there is a funny scene in an elevator where Sellers is in an elevator with a security guard and says \"I've never been in an elevator before\" and asks is there is a TV in the elevator and naturally the guards answer is that there isn't one to begin with. Later that night after Chance is examined by the family doctor (Richard Dysart) he meets Eve's husband Ben (Melvyn Douglas) who is a rich old millionaire dying of cancer and during his final days grows to admire the simple minded gardener. During his stay at the Rand residence Chance's national profile grows with TV appearances, press interviews, state dinner attendances, and even meeting the President of the United States (Jack Warden) who believes that there should be more people like Chance in the United States Congress. The movie is far from perfect but has very few weaknesses (especially MacLaine's mastubation scene on the bear rug in Chance's bedroom) and a script by Jerzy Kosinski (who also wrote the book which I didn't read) which could have been tweaked just a little bit, but otherwise the film is perfect in terms of Asby's excellent direction and standout work from Sellers whose work is on par with Tom Hanks in \"Forrest Gump\" and Dustin Hoffman in \"Rain Man\", MacLaine, Douglas (who got his second Oscar for his performance), and Warden. This is one of the very best movies of its kind and is not to be missed by anyone, Period.",

I found myself frequently glancing at the clock because the scenes lingered far too long.  With tighter direction and editing, this movie could have been a very satisfying 95-100 minutes.In the end, I felt unfulfilled.  I think the pond scene punctuated how ridiculous the movie had become.  What became of the sleazy lawyer?  What was with the president's love life?  I would expect a 130-minute movie to explore subplots in greater detail.  And how did Louise's rant survive the final cut?  While I don't disagree with her assertions, the scene with her watching Chance on TV was jarring and almost completely out of context. I gave this movie a 5 out of 10 solely on the strong performances of Peter Sellers and Melvyn Douglas.  Had the cast been a lower caliber, I'd probably give it a 3.",

He was such a perfectionist, I wouldn't be surprised if he had just kept insisting on completing that speech as written but instead, wound up creating a masterpiece. The sight of him struggling to get through it without cracking himself up (and finally doing it) shows a master at his craft.

His routine seems to consist of eating, gardening, and watching TV. He seems to be such a simpleton that he can't feel much emotion and can hardly understand what anyone's telling him. When the old man finally dies, the people in charge of the estate kick him out of the house.Because he helped himself to an inheritance of some of the old man's fine clothes and his laconic demeanor is mistaken for sincerity and moral fortitude, he somehow finds his way into the hearts of very rich and politically influential people.The plot is typical and predictable. These rich people put him an a pedestal and see whatever good qualities they want to see in this extremely simple-minded man. He is able to ascend to the highest echelons of power, even becoming something of a friend to the president, by simply not doing much while other people waste their energy assuming what they want about him. Perhaps this was the first, not certainly not the last movie where people project themselves onto an extremely simple being.I suppose the title refers to the fact that he was watching all the events on TV for all of his life and finally in a few days or weeks comes to be at the center of all of these significant sociopolitical events - he comes to \"be there.\" Although on the ironic side, he doesn't know what's going on around him because he doesn't have the mental capacity to understand it and keeps preferring to watch TV, so he's physically there but not really there.Near the end, there's a funeral and he doesn't even attend it. Not that it mattered because he wouldn't have understood what was going on if he had.So it raises the question of what it really means to be present in this life. Are we really there is our body just present with our mind wandering who knows where?It's a philosophically interesting question, but the movie itself isn't that impactful.Yes, there's the matter of him being a well-dressed white man who accedes to power despite his mental incapacity whereas a black man wouldn't enjoy such opportunities. But the movie humorously references this directly so as to make sure that the viewer knows it's NOT about that.Honourable Mentions: The movie with a similar plot that comes to mind is Things Change (1988). Here a poor Italian cobbler gets involved with the mob and gets some fancy clothes. That coupled with his quiet demeanor is mistaken for regal diginity. Same thing as this movie - it's mostly people trying to figure out who he is and keep giving him free stuff because they think he's rich and powerful.",

            "content": "Be aware that this is not one of Sellers' action-packed comedies a la \"Revenge of the Pink Panther.\" It's an extremely measured social satire based on the rather bitter novel by Jerzy Kosinski, who also wrote the screenplay.Sellers plays \"Chance, the gardener,\" a man who is both less and more than he appears to be. In the book the character is very much a nonentity who is consistently mis-categorized by people too busy and self-absorbed to see him clearly. Sellers, however, invests the character with a centeredness and calm warmth that makes him both more sympathetic and more believable as a pop-political guru invented by other people's projections.\nAn apparent simpleton, Chance has lived in complete isolation from 'reality.' As the gardener for a once-wealthy invalid living in a townhome in a now-decaying section of Washington, D.C., Chance's life has been spent gardening and mindlessly watching television. When the invalid dies Chance appears to be hopelessly adrift, penniless but dressed in clothes that were the height of fashion 40 years earlier. Serendipity lands Chance at the home of the powerful but dying businessman Mr. Rand (Melvyn Douglas), whose concern over the difficult business climate leads him to mistake Chance for a bankrupt businessman. Chance's unflappable calm endears him to Rand, who has powerful political connections. Appearing with Rand or Rand's wife (Shirley MacLaine), Chance is assumed to be a Rand-backed power broker, and Chance's simple remarks are interpreted as profundities by people who spend more time talking than listening.In Kosinski's book Chance is a vacuum into which others project a personality. Attractive, affable, calm, inoffensive, and vaguely optimistic, Chance has the 'ideal' image of the modern politician. Kosinski means to satirize a political system that rewards those who avoid explaining \"the politics of meaning.\" Image, rather than conviction, intelligence, ability, or integrity, is everything.The problem for the coherence of the satire is that Sellers' Chance is not really a nonentity; in fact he is something of an ideal! Completely centered, he is innocent rather than ignorant, patient, confident, and 'in the moment'. As other reviewers have pointed out, he is a Zen master, a perfect Taoist! In a sense this works, giving the film a much greater range of meaning. However the film's finale, intentionally or not, supports a radically different interpretation from that of Kosinski's novel. Perhaps it happens because no one ever told Chance it couldn't. The audience, however, sees that Chance is not on the shallow surface of the material world, but moves securely above depths too profound to be plumbed by any cane.",

Book of Dolega-Mostowicz is called \"Career of Nikodem Dyzma\". In this novel Nikodem Dyzma a petty thief and small time gangster, accidentally finds on the street letter with written invitation to high society ball. He hires a good looking suit and goes to the ball simply because he is hungry. When hurrying to the table richly filled with food, he bumps with current vice-prime minister and not knowing of course who he is, Dyzma scolds vice-prime minister badly. This scene arouses silent applause in representants of powerful circles actually opposing to the government, which are present at the place. One of these people invites Nikodem (Nico) Dyzma for a talk and congratulates him from the whole heart for his courage... And then Nikodem Dyzma, a man from nowhere begins his career as \"financial consultant\", manager of the bank and soon a candidate for post of prime minister in pre war Poland. Dyzma's vague utterances are taken as (in later book of Kosinski) profound economic advices. Book of Dolega-Mostowicz was filmed too and an excellent polish film is called \"Kariera Nikodema Dyzmy\".",

            "content": "I don't mind the odd depressing tale, but when its done so meakishly that you pity EVERYTHING in the world including every character except our protagonist Chance, it becomes an almost Sci Fi movie. Not unlike the untold history of our protagonist this movie is littered with ignorance and downright incredibility. It's like his bed which Chance says is facing north but we realise early on that he is actually facing towards the opposite direction. All the time 'as viewers' we are to believe that everyone except the maid believes he is this wondrous, illusive ingenious political player. The believing in this story is almost counter-intuitive to our good senses as insightful human beings.He is so wise that he advises the president on policy using a simple gardening philosophy, but not the least does this feel authentic, yet we are so supposed to play along. And I try. Outtakes at the end which show the real actor Peter Sellers laughing at his own lines, is kind of a kick in the head, but reaffirming to to my line of argument. Like Kubrick's 'Dr Strangelove' which also stars our main man Peter Sellers, I was entranced for the first 50 minutes, but the remainder I was underwhelmed for the experience. May be it's a Seller's thing which doesn't rub off well on me, although I did admire his acting in this and Kubrick's Strangelove to some degree.I get where the director wanted to go and how they wanted to get there. But to use Chance's kind of philosophy, 'it's like a bud of a burgeoning flower which sprouts its Hollywood wings to become a plethora of bigger Hollywood makings which will burden us in the 80\u2032s with its plentiful incredulous story lines requiring an even much greater degree of 'suspension of belief.'I don't take this movie lightly as it one of my ol' mans favourites, but unfortunately we will have to agree to disagree on this being a 'classic movie'. I wish he had seen more European movies especially those by a man called Ingmar Bergman and he probably wished I'd seen more by Sellers.

But then I remembered that I live in a country that voted for G.W. Bush....twice. So I deleted it. It's horrifying to me that the reason I think this is a bad adaptation is actually a real thing that happened in the history of this country. In the book, Chance is, yes, very simple, illiterate, uneducated, undeveloped, retarded, etc. But despite this he acts relatively normal. I think at one point the agents trying to research him say that he's the most well adjusted human being they've ever found. He's also described as young and handsome too. In other words the book does a better job of creating the illusion that people would buy into Chance as a soft spoken savant. Whereas in the film, Sellers plays Chance as an over the top dumb dumb right from jump. This detracts from the sting of the satire for me. But as I noted, reality is stranger than fiction because holy good god ***SPOILER ALERT*** G.W. Bush was elected TWO TIMES. So I guess in the end Ashby and Sellers weren't incompetent adapters of a brilliant novella but visionary geniuses of political satire. Bravo.",

While I cannot give this movie a 10 out of 10 the easiness to it and the role played by Peter Sellers does leave you with a sense of calmness, tranquility and the knowledge that sometimes easier things is what we need overall. What is confusing is the end as it leaves you with that question of what is Peter's Character really about.

Bush mirrors Chauncy.  Bush was given everything by his father and friends of his father.  He's never tried to do anything without his father's wanting it.  He's not guided by passion, but by a Forrest Gump style of \"Do what you're told\" direction.   Chauncy is a simple man of simple desires.  Trusting and trustworthy but always guided by the television or his boss.  Chauncy is cow-like in a zen manner.  A mind of Teflon, everything that touches it slides off without effect.  And in that I find the terror.  He makes one wonder just how so many political idiots can get so far.    While Chauncy is the placid face, anyone with more sinister designs directing him can hide behind the vacant cow eyes that entrace people seeking safety.  It may be reassuring to not be threatened by the bland character of Chauncy, but I would never vote for him.    \"Being There\" is a well executed movie of a greater design.  If it appears to run too slowly, get some crafts to do while watching.  Do some knitting or a word find.  That way, the slow spots will not seem so prolonged.  For me, during the computer game, the movie went at an acceptable pace.    Simply put, \"Being There\" is a movie about a character which is the ultimate blank mirror upon which everyone sees themselves or things which they assume to be true.  Luckily for Chauncy, he drifted into the arms of compassionate people that protected him from the cruel world which would have imprisoned or killed him.

Sellers as ever is fantastic, though I feel he did better performances and had better characters in 'Dr.Strangelove' and 'Lolita' Still, it is quite an interesting movie at points.

A valuable lesson can be learned from watching this movie: that those with complicated lives strive for simplicity, but those with simple lives strive for complexity. We should all exist as simple beings and strive for nothing more.Mr. Rand's character ultimately realizes he can never undo the complication-monster he has created in his life, but is ultimately released by the wisdom with which Chauncey unknowingly blesses Rand during their brief friendship. Mrs. Rand falls in love with Chance's unwitting \"strength,\" which remains effortlessly steadfast, even during the ever-primordial act of seduction.When you watch this movie with this preface, you are less amused by the fortunate bumbling of our hero, and more intrigued with the concept of zen and how keeping life as simple as possible can lead us to great heights in our own, uninhibited minds.",

The humor resides not in Sellers character or play, who happens to just be there as the title clearly says, but rather in the reactions his silence triggers in those who surround him. He behaves as a mirror to the subconscious fears and expectations of all layers of society: lawyers, gangsters, the press, foreign diplomats, secret service members, men, women, gays, wealthy, poor, powerful, and humble alike.Some comments reflect upon the fact that \"being there\" is not a remake of the pink panther, that its humor is totally different and doesn't trigger hilarious laughter. It is much subtler than that, planting a huge question mark in the viewer's mind at the beginning of the film and slowly transforming it into an increasingly growing smirk as the story unravels. The parallel with a budding seed carefully tended by a loving gardener is absolutely striking and in perfect unison with the character played by Sellers.Definitely not recommended for rednecks but rather an absolute must-see for those who have more than rice-pudding between their ears. Being there is a true gem, a jewel of comedy, a satirical outlook on society, probably the best creation of the immensely talented humorist that was Peter Sellers.",

Overall, I found the film remarkably faithful to the novella (compared to other adaptations of that period). As I recall, the novella struck me as more 'dark' (in presentation) than the film, even though the film managed to get across all the 'darkness' embedded in the print version. I'd always respected Sellers' abilities, but never liked any of the slapstick films that made up the bulk of his portfolio. It was strangely and sadly satisfying to see him put in the one performance that demonstrated his true value before he passed away. This, and the fact he lobbied for years to play Chance / Chauncey, makes me consider the film a testament to its lead actor like none other before or since.",

We have all those men, educated and intuitive, politicians, businesses men, journalists ready to pay attention and take for granted the words of a man from nowhere, who speaks in metaphors, Chauncey Gardner. \"Yes sir, all you got to be is white in America, to get whatever you want\" are the words of Louise, the closest thing Chance had to a mother, even he didn't realize that. This line, among others, speaks about the issues this picture reveals. Of course the lines may be exaggerated sometimes, the discussion with the reporter at the phone about the comments on the president's statement on national television for example. But these are acceptable flaws. The author is trying to tell the a story of a man, whose existence is based on 'cosmic' coincidences and slightly possible facts, who succeeds in revealing the issues of a world filled with lies and hidden interests, a continuous gold rush.But the most important thing in this movie I consider it to be the character of Chance itself. He's actual immateriality makes him unique in the universe he appeared in. His life, a continuous chain of strange, antisocial events, puts the people he interact with, in the awkward situation of not conceiving the idea the they adore and respect a illiterate retard. This mental blockage of all people, this denial, makes possible the existence of Chance in the world as we know it. The ending scene, which resembles so much with Rene Magrite paintings, well represented in the movie poster, is the final touch of the director. It shouldn't be any surprise that he is floating or walking on water. The umbrella is sinking, the only thing that makes the clothes not to sink is the fact that Chance is wearing them. The author is trying to tell the a story of a man, whose existence is based on 'cosmic' coincidences and slightly possible facts, who succeeds in revealing the issues of a world filled with lies and hidden interests, a continuous gold rush. Of course this is no surprise, we all see how the world around us is. The real skillfulness of Hal Ashby stands not in what he reveals but in how he does it.

            "content": "When Katie Couric asked Sarah Palin what magazines and newspapers she read in their infamous television interview during the 2008 presidential election, Palin, nonplussed, replied, \"All of them.\" Pundits and the public alike knew instantly what Palin's answer signified: She didn't read any of them. I recalled this with amusement the other day while watching a scene from 1979's great political satire, \"Being There.\" In the interview scene with TV journalists and in party scene that follows, Chauncey Gardiner aka Chance the Gardener (Peter Sellers) confesses that he neither reads nor writes, but only watches TV. The movie audience is in on the joke: Chance is telling the unvarnished truth. But, his hearers in the film believe he is simply confessing, with disarming honesty, to not having the time or inclination for more serious pursuits. \"Being There\" was the product of three brilliant talents: Jerzy Kosinski, who wrote the original 1971 novella; Hal Ashby, political filmmaker par excellence; and, Peter Sellers, who wanted to play Chance from the time he first read Jerzy Kosinski's great story. All three men are now sadly deceased. While they portrayed Chance's ignorance and simplicity as benign, it is a given that \"Being There's\" creators would not have been surprised by the ascension to political cult celebrity status of figures such as Palin, whose startling ignorance and vacuity are anything but.Chance's television-attuned attention span and banal (or Zen-like?) pronouncements about gardening make him the man of the moment in \"Being There.\" It is worth recalling that both book and film came out more than 35 years ago, and what was true then is even more so today. Chance is the new Adam for the television generation, which is why the \"Dawn\" sequence from \"Also Sprach Zarathustra\" plays as Chance is sent out of his garden by the two emissaries (lawyers, not angels). Chance's unlikely success appears to be a template for the political careers of today. He even gets his Eve, and gets the blessing of a dying, godlike older man, Benjamin Rand (played, to great acclaim, by the late Melvyn Douglas, who was also Sellers' longtime friend). Chance's tears when his second \"father\" dies (when he shed none for his first) may indicate that he is accepting the mantle of power that is being offered to him, and with it, greater knowledge of good and evil. In \"Being There,\" Chance the Gardener grows. Would that the same could be said for the politicians of today.",

He sees the world from the television that was put in his room at the palatial mansion where he works. His daily meals are prepared by the house cook and life is very controlled. The gardener's life makes perfect sense. That is until his employer, the owner of the mansion.... the old man, dies. That is when all the other staff members leave the home and Chance is left without a place to go. After attorneys come to discover him living in the empty home, he understands he must leave his garden.The mansion was his only home, his only family and with the old man gone, Chance is left to fend for himself in a world he has never seen before, except on TV. Totally perplexed by his circumstance, he packs up his things and sets off into the world to find another garden to tend.His adventure into the world outside the walls of the mansion send him into Washington politics when he is accidentally hit buy a limousine owned by Benjamin Rand, a political big wig who's wife (Shirley McClaine) allows Chance to be taken into their home after the accident. Chance is then given a room and is introduced to the guests and dignitaries who frequent the home. He only want is to be given a new room and a garden to tend. But everything he says is misunderstood to have great, deep meaning and no one thinks he is a gardener.During a political dinner at the mansion, Chance meets the US president and is quoted in his speech to the world. The simple observations of this very simple man have such profound misinterpretations that Chance is elevated to the highest esteem of the first family and beyond.While all this money, power and prestige surrounds him, Chance's simple talk of caring for his garden is misunderstood as metaphors of lofty offices and powerful interests. Chance is interviewed on television where he professes his philosophy about gardens, the people hearing what he says, take him as a great profit. He is famously endorsed and elevated as an icon.This movie is a hoot and will have you laughing on the floor. It holds up to the test of time, I saw it again last night and it was just as powerful and pertinent as it was in 1979 when it was first released. Peter Sellers was never more hilarious and some of the scenes are pop classics. Chance is really just a simple gardener that became a TV junky who likes to watch. The precursor to Forest Gump.",

I give this movie 5 stars and to be more thorough give the movie Being There a thumb side ways. This does not say it is a bad movie, I did like it but I can't give it the 10 stars, 2 thumbs up, and it's a masterpiece though.I think this movie has enough complimentary comments and I most certainly can understand why those comments say masterpiece, but for me, the movie was ok. I agree on one thing about the ending credits, that outtake really takes you out of the movie even though the movie has ended and your mindset is about the movie, wanting to talk about it, and then that outtake abruptly takes you out of the movie so fast your brain freezes. As to say simply, the movie makes you think and then that ending really screws you up.I did like when the TV had something on and it played at certain times during certain scenes creating the messages what was going on like when Shirley MacLaine's character first goes after Peter Sellers's character romantically and Mr. Rogers's Neighborhood was on and Mr. Roger was singing that iconic song about friends and neighbors \"won't you be mine\", and \"won't you be my neighbor\". The TV said what was going on in the scene what the Peters's character was thinking. That was the one of those things that would make this movie a masterpiece.The scenes about the finding out about Chance, the research and investigating etc and finding out nothing and they kept on that for a little to long I think. I just wanted the movie to make it's point and end. This is why I would LOVE to try to read the book instead of watching the movie over to see if I missed something. Remember what I said about liking to read, here I would LOVE to read the book now. Another thing, I would love to revisit this movie as in yes that horrible thought, I would love to see a sequel but to see how far a sequel and the characters can go after the original. Now that I would LOVE to see along with reading the book.Of course you have other movies like this one or at least the kind of character Chance was, the most famous, of course, was Forrest Gump. Other movies mentioned in other reviews are Taxi Driver and Edward Scissorhands. Did anyone mention Sling Blade? Except for Edward Scissorhands (in which I have not ever seen), but Taxi Driver, Forrest Gump and Sling Blade are 10 starred thumbs up movie masterpieces I think. Not saying Being There isn't but I have a simple mind too myself as I am not a writer or \"a smart man\" to quote Forrest Gump, but these are my true thoughts about the movie Being There.",

            "content": "Despite being the predecessor of such cult movies as 'Rain Man' and 'Forrest Gump', unfortunately, 'Being There' never became popular among a broad audience. However, the picture was listed in the ASC List of 100 Milestone Films in Cinematography of the 20th Century and undoubtedly was included in my short list of political satire movies worth analyzing.At the center of the movie is an autistic gardener Chance, who used to live in the place of an 'old man', working in his garden and spending all his free time watching TV. He had been taught neither to read nor write, and was not ever responsible for his daily needs. After the death of an old man, he had to find a new place. By a twist of fate, he is entering the house of the dying gray cardinal of American politics and unexpectedly becoming the candidate for the new president of the USA.One of the reasons why the film was not popular in the USA is that while modern American society believes that only the best can make their way to the power and wealth, the movie illustrates that actually, clothes make the man. A white middle-aged man in an expensive suit is mistaken for an eccentric influential finance whale, his banal thoughts about the gardens for a revelation, absence of information about his past for an FBI or CIA attempts to hide something significant. High society manners didn't let all these blue blood owners ask Gardener about his occupation or background and they prefer to believe in the most possible picture from their perspective.But it is only the one layer of the film. The other one elucidates the egocentrism of Americans. No one listens to the Chance for real. Everyone uses him as a mirror and sees in his actions and speech the reflection of his mindset and wishes. Ben Rand puts into Chance's words wisdom, Eve sees acceptance of her feminity and independence in his indifferent actions, security staff creates theories around the lack of information about Chance's personality.And the last but not least, the creature of Hal Ashby emphasizes the power of media to establish any desirable reality. The population is ready to believe in the uniqueness of Chance only because people on TV said he is unique. Some are even ready to replace their experience with Chance with the impression from the rumors. Like Tom, the attorney, after the TV show mistrusts his initial impression of Chance as a strange simple-minded gardener. Probably, from the creator's point of view, a huge love of Chance to watch TV is a metaphor for the present world being made by media. This aspect of the film makes it very actual for today.While the film is philosophical, it raises a lot of questions, and has a lot of strengths, it is hard not to mention that it has some structural issues. In terms of three act structure, there is no clear third act and no climax. After one-third of the film, all we can see is a repetition of the same idea but with different heroes. The absence of a climax and a very questionable ending leave the audience unsatisfied but not in a good way. Very monotonic tempo also does not help to be involved in the film. The main issue from my perspective is that the picture does not build sympathy for the gardener or identification with him. Because of that, watching 'Being There' activates the mind, not the feelings and there is no place for a catharsis.To conclude, I would describe 'Being There' as a soft satire of American life. Taking into account that it is based on the same named novel by Jerzy Kosinski, is understandable why the film looks like a visualized novel rather than a movie. It stands out among other satirical movies for the unique hero and for his unexpected ending, which, by the way, illustrates that everything is possible in today's life - to walk on water and for an autistic gardener Chance to become a president of America.",

The diversity of opinion from great admiration to boredom reminded me of a group of art admirers standing in front of a painting depicting a small central dot on a large white canvas. Some see the meaning of life in the dot, and the others see a waste of canvas.  I am afraid I am with the latter group. The character Chauncey Gardener was so flat emotionally, that if emotion could be measured on an EKG, he would be declared emotionally dead.  If the lead character doesn't generate any interest on my part from the beginning it then affects the whole movie.  That lead character doesn't have to be likeable or nice. Hannibal Lector was not a nice character but Hopkins does such a great job with him that you want to follow him thru out the movie. Many mention Forrest Gump as a sequel to this movie, but Hanks makes the character of Gump a more interesting person, with more substance, and a range of emotional aspects that make Gump someone you are interested in from the very beginning. After that it just was impossible to believe that so many people he met in the movie would accept this man as they did.  And equally impossible to believe that Maclaine's character would actually be physically attracted to him! At times, as an aside, there were images more of Chaplin, rather then Laurel.  The clothes, the stances, the mute qualities were very reminiscent of him. The last scene, which may seem clever by the author and director, clouded up the whole movie for me.  Whether this was a reference to Chauncey as a Jesus-like person, with parables, a father figure suggesting God, coming at a difficult time in history, providing sage guidance, and walking on water, or, it was a child-like symbol where he walks on water because of his innocence, seems like poppy cock to me.  If it was the latter, how many kids drown each year because they too don't know they can't walk on water or should fear it, and Chauncey as a human couldn't defy physics by walking on water. The scene was clever but confusing.",
