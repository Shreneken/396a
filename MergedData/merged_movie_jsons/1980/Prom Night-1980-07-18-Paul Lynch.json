            "content": "Six years ago four kids make a pack to keep a secret, which involved the mysterious death of child Robin Hammond. They thought that were the only ones who knew what had happened, but some else witnessed it to. Now that person strings them along, to eventually plan their revenge during Prom night.A real thank-you to the commercial success of \"Halloween (1977)\" and \"Friday the 13th (1980), which saw the influx of slasher films and \"Prom Night\" was one of the first to step up. Too bad that we have here is an unspectacular so-so, if slick looking slasher effort that got caught labouring along with very little happening and providing us with corny school melodramatics. When it came to the crunch, most of the Prom Night sequences was about getting the groove on and listening to funky dory disco soundtrack. Oh it just makes you want to bogey; well it didn't stop Jamie Lee Curtis from strutting her stuff. However when it came to the good stuff, I thought the novel deaths were soundly executed, and there's a certain unpleasantness about them. When the black hooded killer (who's quite fast on their feet and would make for a good shaker too) is tormenting and stalking the victims (from be it to the phone calls or hanging about in the shadowy corridors) there's an ominous air to proceedings, which director Paul Lynch pulls off rather well. It's just too bad that most of the time is used setting this all up with ineffective red herrings and below par, drawn out script. Too many loose ends creep in, even though the premise is quite slight and you can find yourself laughing at its unintentional goofiness and picking up on it predictability. Robert New's stunningly vivid camera movements are atmospherically airy and Paul Zaza and Carl Zittrer's sorrowfully twisted musical score gets it cues right. The performances from the cast are acceptable with a likable Jamie Lee Curtis (earning her scream queen tag at the time) proves herself as an upcoming talent. Weak character, but well judged performance. Leslie Nielsen looks awkwardly distracted, and seems to duck off in a phone-in performance and George Touliatos gives the film some solidarity. Anne-Marie Martin is a delight as the scheming sexpot Wendy, David Mucci is perfect as the boorish brute Lou and Casey Stevens is modest as Curtis' prom date Nick.This post-Halloween slasher is familiar and slowly plotted, but its competent technical handling helps.",

            "content": "A young girl dies tragically when she falls through the window of an abandoned building upper floor as a result of a scare tactic prank performed by four kids playing a hide-n-seek version of \"I'm going to kill you.\" The kids responsible make a silent pact to keep their actions behind this death secret, with a schizophrenic known child abuser accused of being the guilty culprit responsible. The wrongfully accused man is seriously burned after trying to flee the police with his car turned over in a crash. Breaking free from the asylum imprisoning him, this event coincides with the four kids, now teenagers in high school, receiving creepy phone calls from an unknown psychopath forewarning their up coming meeting at the senior prom. The film shows the days leading up to the senior prom, and the psycho, dressed in black with a ski-mask covering his face, attacking each member of the group responsible(..when they are most vulnerable, away from a crowd of people, alone in some place either inside the quiet abandoned halls & rooms of the school, or just outside the building) for the little girl's death many years ago, on Prom Night.More along the line of \"Halloween\" than \"Friday the 13th\", this is a methodical(..some might say..slowwwwwwwww moving)character driven slasher with limited death sequences shown, with most of the killer's murderous activities occurring off screen. I will say that the victims are developed, given exposition before the senior prom so that they gain sympathy from the audience. The only one who might deserve her comeuppance in many viewer's eyes is Wendy(Anne-Marie Martin), the very one who instigated the silence of their misdeeds as children, and the one who causes most of the mischief towards Kim(Jamie Lee Curtis), who is dating her former squeeze, Nick(Casey Stevens). What makes this union most interesting is that Kim's sister was the girl who fell through the window to her death, and Nick was one of the kids responsible for frightening her with that game. We witness the other two girls, now young women either experiencing love for the first time or heartbreak, before meeting their doom at the hands of the mysterious psycho. As is the case in giallo thrillers, which this is closer in spirit than 80's slashers, there are red herrings regarding who the killer might be. Could the psycho be the escaped lunatic seeking revenge for being framed for a murder he didn't commit? Could the killer be Kim's grieving father, Principal Hammond(Leslie Nielsen, handed a very underwritten role)? Could the killer be the peeping tom, alcoholic, sneaky janitor? I'm just not convinced this will work for many slasher fans because the seedy, gratuitous elements which draw such a crowd are not that present here.Like a lot of fans of \"Halloween\" from their youth onward, I followed Jamie Lee Curtis' career, looking for other horror films on VHS shelves, and \"Prom Night\" was one of those. Expecting something more visceral, I guess I was a tad bit disappointed. Watching it as an adult, I believe I can see what director Paul Lynch was trying to accomplish..building up these characters looking forward to the future, or dwelling on their own personal dramas and dilemmas(..relationships and growing pains, these teens had in high school), before facing a grim fate they weren't prepared for. He also lenses the film, very soft-focus, giving it an almost dreamlike aura. One of a handful of slashers Curtis would star in during the early 80's before moving on to \"Trading Places\" where she'd hone her comedic chops, she was blossoming into a stunning woman. While I loathe disco with a passion, this film might amuse as a time-capsule film with how Curtis shows her stuff on the dance floor. She even teases her faithful with a lockeroom sequence showing how she has developed wearing a bra, shirt opened. As far as the death sequences, the highlight, of course, is the decapitation where a thug, taking Nick's place after he and his cronies attacked him, tying the kid up in a situation planned by Wendy, gets his head lopped off with it rolling onto the dance-floor walkway. The film's main suspense chase concerns Wendy trying to flee her pursuer through the empty halls of the school as the other teens are dancing. The film's reveal of the killer is really kind of sad, actually, as so many perish because of a childish prank which could've been prevented if the kids responsible had acted civilized.",

            "content": "Maybe the reason \"Prom Night\" doesn't have brilliant scores on IMDb is because it's supposed to be a horror movie, but it isn't. It is more of a thriller mixed with a teen movie. A good and entertaining teen movie at that. It has interesting and likable characters, some gloriously cheesy (even hilarious) scenes and nice disco music. Performances of the actors are decent and there is even a pretty good chase scene which looks like something that inspired Craven's chase scenes in Scream! Objectively, this movie is a good piece of fun featuring Jamie Lee Curtis in her prime and Leslie Nielsen (it's really weird to see him trying to be serious and you are just waiting to drop some jokes) and if you like a comfy teen movie with a little slasher thrown in the mix, you will have a good time. If you on the other hand want just horror like \"Halloween\" was, well, you are in for a disappointment. 7.5/10! I recommend it to both veterans and casuals alike!",

            "content": "\"Prom Night\" emerged at the beginning of a decade, which also marked a decade for the rise and fall of slasher films as we know them. Along with \"Terror Train\" and \"The Fog\", \"Prom Night\" is one of Jamie Lee Curtis's most well-known returns to the genre after \"Halloween\", though it still remains fairly obscure to many horror fans and general audiences. The plot centers on Kim Hammond (Curtis), daughter of her high school's principal (Leslie Nielsen). She's popular, well-liked, and seems to have it all. Unfortunately, Kim and her family are haunted by the mysterious death of her younger sister, Robin, who died after falling from the top floor of an abandoned building ten years prior; the police blamed a schizophrenic child predator on the crime, but little do they know, there were four children who were there and whom were responsible for the incident. Those four children are now high school seniors, classmates and friends of Kim; it's prom night, which is incidentally the ten year anniversary of Robin's death. Kim will be crowned prom queen. Some won't live to see it.If the \"Prom Night\"'s plot set-up sounds familiar, that's because it is. Though the film was fresh twenty-some years ago, its originality has been obstructed by the plethora of slasher films that followed in its wake, which may leave some viewers bored and running the numbers; but if you can look past this, \"Prom Night\" is an extremely fun film. It has a little bit of everything going for it: an elusive killer, odd phone calls, probable motives, sassy high school girls, disco dancing, a ski-mask, and, most importantly, an axe. Team up the carefree high school environment with five teenagers' dark secret, and accompany that with a hellbent murderer on prom night, and you've got yourself a straightforward, suspenseful piece of slasher cinema.Granted, the film is dated, and the disco dances and funky hairdos of the day may take be distracting to some extent, but the nostalgia of that era is in every frame. Paul Zaza's score is appropriately ominous and ignites a feeling of being under watch by... someone, and at all times. Director Paul Lynch also does a fine job here, showing us just enough, but not too much. Nice establishing shots of the high school's hallways at night set the stage for the action that ensues as night falls and the prom begins, and several impressive instances of cinematography abound (the slow-motion throat slash murder which only shows us a close- up of the victim's facial expression, followed by a fade-in to the red punch bowl being one example). There are several surprisingly artsy shots in the film, and the camera-work is, for the most part, clever. The film has a rather bright, hazy look to it as well, which, whether intended or not, gives the movie another sort of texture.Performance-wise, we've got a surprisingly decent cast of 20-somethings playing 18-year-olds. Nonetheless, most all involved give commendable performances, Jamie Lee Curtis included. Leslie Nielsen's role is minor, but he's great, and Eddie Benton does a good job as the jealous rich girl of the school (and might I say, she has one of the best chase scenes I've ever seen in a horror film). Though the film takes roughly an hour before all the mayhem ensues, the build-up is worth the wait\u2014 the final 15 minutes of the film are incredibly fun (almost as fun as the hokey disco dance scene with Jamie Lee Curtis and Casey Stevens, ala \"Saturday Night Fever\"). The killer himself is eerie and has an interesting choice of weapons (a shard of broken mirror), even though his whispering \"now!\" upon each murder might sound funny. The revelation at the end of the film may or may not be expected, depending on the viewers' familiarity with these types of films. Either way, it's pretty poignant for a slasher movie.Overall, \"Prom Night\" is a wonderful example of slasher prototypes. It was early enough to not be considered a total rip-off, and it's got a lot of interesting things going for it, no matter how by-the-numbers it seems today. It's suspenseful, sometimes spooky, and genuinely fun and lively. Factor in some wonderful murder scenes, a budding scream queen, an eerie score, and a full-fledged disco blood-bash, and you have yourself one of the most memorable slasher films of the 1980s. 9/10.",

However, it seems someone else is planning on getting some murderous revenge on prom night.Prom Night is a formula slasher film, with plenty of the slasher trappings, but there are some elements that raise this film above some of the others of it kind. The director gives this movie a truly dark and eerie atmosphere, with the help of Paul Zaza's spooky music score. The plot remains engaging throughout and the creep-factor is kept high. One difference from the slasher \"norms\" is the fact that we ultimately have sympathy and even sorrow for the film's killer.While Prom Night is hardly a flawless movie, in fact there are a few scenes where the lighting is way too low and the disco prom dates the film, it does hold it's own. The cast gives good performances, especially Curtis, Eddie Benton, and the late Casey Stevens. There's also a few good rock numbers like \"Prom Night\" and the mellow \"Fade to Black\".Worth a look for slasher fans.*** out of ****",

Along with Jamie Lee Curtis, none of the other characters are really that interesting or we get to know anything about them throughout the whole movie it's just them talking and goofing around. By the hour mark is where it starts to get interesting because that's when the prom actually happens with the killer pursuing his victims but more generic and clich\u00e9 with teenagers just making dumb decisions there's a scene with one girl just runs further away for the auditorium where all the students are dancing and just runs to the far end of the school where no one would even know she was here. This entire film they constantly hammer and the possibility of suspects who the killer might be. The ending is disappointing and Lazy. The most recognizable scene in this movie is the dance with the Prom night song playing. This movie could've been cut down to a short film instead of feature-length.",

Lots of disco-dancing too in this one.

            "content": "A child dies after being chased out the window of an abandoned building by four other children. An unseen witness to the accident comes back years later looking for revenge, and heads roll. Literally.The dead child, Robin Hammond, was the daughter of the high-school principal (Leslie Neilsen) and the sister of Kim (Jamie Lee Curtis). Robin also had a twin brother, Alex. Four children were present when Robin fell, but only one of them, Nick (Casey Stevens) suggests going for help. The other three -- Wendy (Eddie Benton), Kelly (Mary Beth Rubens), and Jude (Joy Thompson)-- make him swear never to reveal what happened. Robin's death is blamed on a psycho named Murch, whose car crashes while he is being pursued by police.We see the Hammond family paying a visit to Robin's grave-site six years later. The anniversary of her death coincides with the date of Kim's senior prom. Buzzkill! In the intervening years, Nick and Kim have become \"involved\". Nick is a sincere chap, but not sincere enough to tell Kim that he helped kill her sister, although he appears to toy briefly with the idea when Kim breaks down in tears about how the day of the prom is the anniversary of her sister's death. \"It would have been her first prom,\" she sobs. \"Uh, Kim...\" says Nick, uncomfortably, before he wimps out and trots off to football practice.Kim is also friends with Kelly and Jude, neither of whom seems to be bothered in the least by the dead sister..er, elephant in the room. As for Wendy, who has grown up to be the quintessential Rich Bitch Mean Girl, she doesn't care about anything but clothes, cars...and Nick.Apparently, Nick broke up with Wendy to date Kim, and Wendy isn't taking it well. Wendy asks Lou (played with sullen, stupid menace by David Mucci) to help her get revenge. Lou -- one of the more fully realized characters in the film -- readily agrees; you get the feeling that his future includes an appearance on an episode of \"Cops\". When he arrives at Wendy's house to take her to the prom, he passes her a bottle of whiskey, belches, wipes his mouth, and says \"You look terrific.\" A shadowy figure with a guttural voice makes phone calls to Nick, Wendy, Jude, and Kelly, promising mayhem at the prom, but no one seems alarmed, even when Kelly and Jude find their yearbook pictures pinned in their lockers with shards of a broken mirror. Kim and Wendy meow and scratch at each other over Nick. Kelly agonizes over whether to let her boyfriend, Drew, go \"all the way\". Jude meets a short, frizzy-haired kid in a Chevy van; he calls himself \"Slick\" and asks her to the prom. At the prom, Wendy and Lou's entrance spurs Nick and Kim to hit the dance floor, where they twirl and prance in synchronized abandon to an aggressive disco beat.In the background, the police skitter about looking for Murch, who, conveniently for the plot, has escaped from the local asylum in time to serve as the largest and smelliest in a series of red herrings. A creepily-mustached school janitor has also been offered up for suspicion. And all this before any blood is shed at all.Kelly is the first to die, in a locker room, where she has gone to make out with Drew. When she refuses to do the deed, Drew stomps out to \"...find someone who will!\", leaving Kelly to sob \"Drew, you bastard!\" just before the killer sticks a shard of mirror through her windpipe.Jude dies next. Slick's nerdy exterior conceals a van equipped with a bed and enough weed to knock out Cheech and Chong. As Jude and Slick toke up and giggle about losing their virginity to each other, the killer opens the back door of the van, slits Jude's throat, and dispatches Slick by forcing him to drive the van off a cliff.Wendy is the only one of the victims who shows any gumption. Confronted by the ax-wielding killer, she kicks off her high heels, runs like a deer, and takes refuge in the school auto shop. The killer finds her when she attempts to hide in a closet and finds the still-warm body of poor, virginal Kelly hanging on the wall. Her screams give away her position and the ax falls shortly thereafter.When Nick and Kim queue up to be crowned King and Queen of the prom, Lou and his goons grab Nick and tie him up. Lou puts on the crown and waits for his cue -- receiving instead an ax to the back of the neck. His head, with the crown at a rakish angle, rolls out onto the dance floor and grosses everyone out. Meanwhile, Kim has rescued Nick and the killer realizes he's decapitated the wrong guy. The killer grabs the ax and goes after Nick -- only to be disarmed by Kim, who smacks him in the head. The women do all the heavy lifting in this film.The killer staggers out the front door of the high school, whereupon Kim realizes who he is and tackles him before the police can shoot. She pulls off the killers' ski mask to reveal her brother, Robin's twin, Alex. It seems that Alex was at the school when Robin fell out the window, and has known all this time who was responsible. He dies in Kim's arms as the music swells.A very large question arises from the ashes of this movie: If you were a little boy and someone pushed your twin sister out a window, wouldn't you run screaming home and tell your parents right away? And, failing that, wouldn't you feel compelled to tell your older sister she was dating one of the people responsible? Just asking.",

            "content": "After failing to sell Halloween producer Irwin Yablans on his pitch for a movie, director Paul Lynch ran with the suggestion that he set his film during a holiday. A prom seemed like a pretty big event and it tied in well with a story writer Robert Guza had created that was all about childhood trauma coming back to haunt people. Once Jamie Lee Curtis signed to be in the film (Brady Bunch star Eve Plumb was also up for the role), all that was left was to make the movie.\nThe film starts in 1974, when Wendy, Jude, Kelly and Nick are playing some weird game that seems like hide and seek but has them screaming, \"The murderers are coming!\" Maybe this is a game that kids play in Canada that teaches them that if they are not polite, they will be killed.Another girl, Robin, tries to join in but they start chasing her while yelling, \"Kill! Kill!\" They back her up toward a window which she falls out of to her doom. Instead of telling the police, the kids make a pact to never reveal the truth. After Leonard Mench, a sex offender, is caught in the area, he is blamed and jailed for the crime.Six years later, Robin's family celebrate the memorial of her death while her twin brother Alex and teenage sister Kim (Curtis) prepare for the prom. Their parents will also be at the prom, as Mr. Hammond is the school principal He's played by Leslie Nielsen, adding some star power before everyone would only know him as a serious actor. In fact, Airplane! would come out the same month as this movie.Kelly, Jude and Wendy (Anne-Marie Martin, billed here as Eddie Benton, former wife of Jurassic Park creator Michael Crichton) have all started getting obscene calls while Nick never answers the phone. They're all too worried about the prom, after all. Kim and Nick have been dating, Jude is going with goofball Slick Crane and Kelly is going with Drew (and he cannot wait for afterward, so they can have sex). Wendy used to date Nick and now, she is going to the prom with school bad boy Lou to embarrass her former friends.There are so many bad omens: the locker room mirror is cracked and a shard is missing; Leonard Mench has escaped; and Wendy, Jude and Kelly have discovered their yearbook photos stabbed with glass and placed in their lockers.Everyone still goes to the prom, where most of the drama is the triangle between Kim, Nick and Wendy. Disco was still somewhat around - it's never really died to be honest - when this was released. Dig that dancing goodness.\nKelly and Drew are getting hot and heavy, but she refuses to go all the way. He leaves just in time for a giallo-style black-clad killer to slit her throat with a shard of the mirror. This same killer kills Jude and Slick after they share a joint and do some dancing - horizontal style - in his van.The sex offender has been caught, so the police stop scrutinizing the prom. Yep, three kids are dead under their noses and they just move on. Maybe this really is a giallo with a police force this bad at their jobs!Actually, that number is increasing, as the killer has an axe and he chases Wendy through the school, finally killing her just after she finds Kelly's corpse.Will Prom Night only be a slasher movie? Nope. It's going to have a Carrie scene as well, in addition to trying to be Saturday Night Fever! Kim and Nick are just about to be crowned king and queen when Lou and his gang tie up Nick and steal his crown. Lou gets ready backstage and the killer thinks he's Nick and well, his head rolls as the prom dancers run in abject terror.Kim frees her boyfriend and they run from the killer, who only attacks him. She grabs the axe and hits the masked man in the head before realizing who it is - her brother! Turns out he watched the kids kill their sister and has been waiting for revenge. She tries to stop the cops from shooting him, but the axe wound does him in and our heroine cries at the death of her brother.Wow. Who knew Canadians were so nihilistic? What a dark ending! Prom Night is a great slice of 80's fun that really has nothing in common with any of its sequels. But that's fine.",

            "content": "Arriving as it did during the early moments of the slasher film explosion of the 80's, Prom Night was undoubtedly much more impressive then than it is today. Stripped of historical significance, modern viewers will probably be disappointed to find this dated offering to be a relatively bloodless affair with a meager body count and limited thrills. Certainly, as a horror film, Prom Night doesn't have the tools to deliver any solid scares. But as a piece of time capsule kitsch, this movie is a very fun watch, even if the unintentional laughs outweigh the splatter elements.The set-up that ultimately launches the film's flimsy revenge plot is silly and awkwardly-staged, with a young girl basically walking out of a window to her death because a quartet of pint-sized kids her own age chant \"kill\" over and over again. This isn't a particularly terrifying scenario, so things get off to a clumsy start here.It doesn't help matters that the next hour of the film is almost completely devoid of anything suspenseful, scary, or even interesting, save for a series of phone calls to the film's eventual victims made by a killer who has obviously watched too many Dario Argento films. The rest of the runtime for the first two acts is padded with long-winded character development, needless subplots, and a few attempts at red herring planting that ultimately fall flat.There is also a lot of screen time devoted to extended Disco dancing sequences, which, predictably, have aged far worse than the rest of the film. Compounding the goofiness, when Jamie Lee Curtis and her date are horrified to see that their nemeses have arrived at the prom despite being expelled, Jamie Lee proclaims, \"let's show them what we can do!\", at which point she and her partner take to the dance floor and lay down some revenge boogie. Take that, jerks! The film shows us too much of the killer early on, so even though this is supposed to be a whodunnit, the list of likely suspects is quite short by the time any of the murders start happening. Even worse, the masked, black-clad maniac is the smallest-statured movie psycho of all time, and any menace derived from our mysterious prom-crasher is promptly done away with once we see them and Jamie Lee on the screen at the same time, at which point we can't help but notice that our scream queen star is both taller and more physically intimidating than the killer.When the slasher movie festivities finally get underway, the resulting murders are downright quaint in their subdued delivery, and only a couple of sequences have any real impact. The payoff is relatively meager considering the extended exposition, and while the killer's surprise reveal at the end makes narrative sense, it is a bit disconcerting to see that the skulking murderer we've been following throughout the film is actually the most benign character in the entire cast.A horror classic, this ain't. But the glaring markers of the era give the film nostalgic interest, and it's definitely fun to see Leslie Nielsen playing it straight, even if he abruptly disappears from the film without explanation before the climax. Jamie Lee is also a welcome presence, and although she seems to be phoning her scenes in most of the time, we have to concede that she gives the admittedly weak material about what it deserves.The ancillary elements of the film (including the very cool theatrical poster and its killer tag-line) are actually more interesting than the finished product, and only the most forgiving fans of the genre's boom during this period will gleam much enjoyment here.It's hard to recommend a film that has such limited appeal, but I must confess that I have a genuine fondness for Prom Night, and I still enjoy myself every time I watch it. 1978-1983 was truly a magical era when the horror genre exploded with low budget delights, and if you hold those golden years in your heart, your chances of forgiving this film's trespasses are much better.",

And I still think some people think it is, because they made numerous sequels and a lackluster remake recently came out. But I want to know why. This film was mostly boring, with really awful lighting and characters I could not keep straight or give two figs about. It comes across as something like \"I Know What You Did Last Summer\" (only much earlier, obviously), except for one major difference: the girl who gets killed in the beginning is certainly very dead.Director Paul Lynch should not take pride in this. Not that he has done anything to really take pride in (besides some decent episodes of \"Star Trek\"). If I were to sit down and enjoy a chai tea with Paul, I would have so many questions to ask him about what possessed him to make such an awful film. And then I would make him buy my tea. (Though, to be fair, this was an early attempt from him, having really only worked on the forgotten \"Blood & Guts\", which was also written by \"Prom Night\"'s William Gray, who penned the much better \"The Changeling\" that same year.)The casting is confusing. Leslie Neilsen appears, in a serious role, but he adds essentially nothing to the movie for the brief moments he is in it. Jamie Lee Curtis, fresh from \"Halloween\", shows up as the heroine and I think we are supposed to think she is an attractive teenager. But she looks like a 30-year old cross-dressing man. If people in 1980 thought this was sexy, I am really glad I was not around to be a part of that. Then again, my friend Seth still does, so who knows? All the other actors are forgettable, besides maybe Sheldon Rybowski, the guy who plays Slick.Only one scene in the entire movie was actually cool for the horror fans, and you will have to wait for over an hour to see it -- and if you blink or do not have slow-motion on your DVD player, you may likely miss it. I will not say what happens, but a character gets killed. Very quickly.There is also a really elaborate dancing scene (that I hope is in the remake, but disco probably is not cool anymore). I enjoyed that, and I freely admit it. So, despite all the trash I talk in this review, I have to confess there were parts I liked... oh, you know, like every scene with Slick.I suppose with the remake having come out, you should watch the original first. Might give you some perspective. I thought it was safe to say the new one would be vastly superior, especially if they had cast up and coming starlets like Mary Elizabeth Winstead. But they did not, and that is just my personal bias. So, it seems the old boring film might be better than the new... a small miracle, really. The one thing that is hard about being a horror fan is trying to explain why Jamie Lee Curtis is a horror actress... and I just do not have the heart to defend her. Do not watch this film unless you want to be confused and disappointed.Synapse Films is releasing a 2K digital restoration in 2014. I was able to catch an advance screening, though I have to say it falls under that old story: you can polish a poop, but it is still a poop.",

This film is equal parts \"Halloween\" \"Psycho\" and \"Carrie\" however those films are superior. In this film a 10 year old girl dies when she playing a twisted little game with a group of friends. A innocent man Leonard Murch gets convicted of the crime. 6 years later on Prom Night we learn the man has escaped and out for revenge.Now SPOILERS AHEAD When we see who the killer at the end there is red stuff all over his face. Is it blood or lipstick? Well I know! If you have only seen this film on DVD you are seeing a poor transfer of the film. For years people have debated on what on his lips! Is blood from a wound or lipstick? Well the actor told me himself it is LIPSTICK. Alex morphed into Robin to kill off the right people who were responsible for the death of Robin. He told me \"He even now stutters like Robin\" Now there. He actually dies as Robin. Now there is a throw away line when Kim's (Jamie Lee Curtis) mother is looking for her lipstick. This is the lipstick the killer has on at the end.The Blu-Ray Disc however has a far better picture than the old DVD. You can now tell it is lipstick and not blood!This 1980 film is still a fun film to watch. The Cheesy Dance Sequence is good a for a few laughs.

            "content": "'Prom Night' is a decent little slasher-mystery starring Jamie Lee Curtis in her third scream queen role. The movie also stars Leslie Nielsen as Jamie Lee's father and Hamilton High School principal. Everyone else in it are just bit players, but we must consider that this film stars one of the wickedest you-know-whats in slasher movie history. Her name is Wendy, and she is played by Anne-Marie Martin. Who this actress is, or was, I have no idea, but I know I hated her character with a passion. One of the biggest bonuses for horror fans in this movie will be the big chase scene with her and the killer quite near the end which was deliberately filmed super dark. You can hardly see what's going on and for me it is the best scene in the whole movie. Big points for Wendy's chase scene. It works since she plays the role well, and we've waited so long for this scene and it comes pretty much near the end, but it delivers.Anyway, 'Prom Night' opens with a tragedy in which young Robin Hammond, who is Jamie Lee's character's little sister, accidentally falls to her death from a two-story window after being cornered by four brats(Wendy, Nick, Kelly, and Jude)who were trying to scare her. Freaked out that they may be in serious trouble, they all make a pact to take it to the grave, initiated by Wendy, the leader of the brats. Ultimately the blame gets pegged on some serial pedophile and no one ever suspects the four kids. But someone else knows and was there and saw the whole thing. We continue twelve years later. It's the day of the prom and all four of the kids receive raspy phone calls, asking them to \"come out to play\". It concerns most of them, but eventually their minds stray back to the prom. Some of them have dates, some don't. Jamie Lee ends up going with Nick who just dumped Wendy, so Wendy hooks up with Lou, who sort of serves as John Travolta's Billy Nolan from 'Carrie', and the two of them plan to play a prank on Jamie Lee and Nick since they were voted Prom King and Queen. Pause real quick. Remember, Nick is one of the kids who was involved with the death of Jamie Lee's little sister. Could you really keep a secret that big from someone you are \"going steady\" with? Also, the two other girls involved, Kelly and Jude, appear to be good friends with Jamie Lee's character. I don't think there is much logic in that, but hey, it's a horror movie. I have to overlook it.In the end, prom dreams are sliced and diced as the vengeful killer begins knocking each of them off, eighties style. The movie is definitely pretty corny and cheaply made, but that's all part of it's charm. The suspense is there, the score is really creepy, and Jamie Lee does her thing. However, the best part is the mystery. Who is the killer? I'm sure we all know twenty-five years later, but it was fun finding out. Everyone is a suspect in 'Prom Night', as mentioned by Randy from the first 'Scream', and it will keep you guessing right up to the climax. Well, actually, when it gets to that point there are only a couple people left that it can be...but it was still a bit of a surprise. Honestly, I think 'Prom Night' could use a remake. My VCR copy has such awful quality that it's really quite hard to see what's going on on the screen, and I hear that the DVD isn't any better, so I think we could all benefit from a remastered version, or even a remake at this point.6/10 is my vote. A decent little slice and dice mystery from days long gone. How I miss them...",

About 3 quarters into the film I was wondering if I was watching a slasher or a high school drama, because nothing really happens until the end. When things do start to happen, your senses are bombarded with cheesy disco music and some tedious stalk and slash scenes which are completely devoid of suspense. There is also no real gore apart from a severed head. The severed head scene is cool in a cheesy way, but that's about it. Watch this if you must, but please stop billing it as a classic.

In this film, an ax-wielding maniac targets four high school students who had inadvertently caused the death of one of their friends six years before. One of the unlucky quartet, Nick, is the boyfriend of prom queen Kim, played by Jamie Lee Curtis; what a shame, then, that the anniversary of the tragedy coincides with the night of the big school bash.... Anyway, this film really is a mixed bag at best. It rarely goes far enough in terms of excitement and violence, is filled with false shocks and red herrings, and has a slow buildup that is barely paid off in the picture's final third. With the exception of the plight of Wendy, the bitchiest of the four, whose pursuit by the killer throughout the school and in an underground garage IS quite suspenseful (probably because Wendy is the only one who lasts long enough to show any sign of fear!), and a bravura final five minutes that are memorably off the wall, the picture generates little in the way of thrills. (PERSONAL NOTE TO ASPIRING FILMMAKERS: If a character in a horror picture is not afraid, the audience won't be either. Imagine the shower scene in \"Psycho,\" if \"Mother\" had merely killed Marion Crane while her back was to him. How less effective that scene would have been, without Janet Leigh's classic scream and the fear that was so well conveyed! Sure, the scene would still have been suspenseful, but not nearly as memorable and harrowing. Fear is communicable, and without that identification on the part of the viewer, there are no scares; just buildup and butchery.) What's worse, a side issue regarding Kim becoming aware of Nick's involvement in her sister's death is never resolved, and the talents of both Leslie Nielsen and Antoinette Bower (who will always be \"Star Trek\"'s Sylvia the witch woman to me!) are squandered in teensy roles. Still, there are compensations. The picture looks great and is well acted by its mainly young cast, and the identity of the killer (virtually every character is suspect) will most likely come as a surprise; I felt sure that I had guessed it for a change, but was wrong, as usual. Director Paul Lynch has given his film some interesting touches also (love that slow dissolve into a blood-red punch bowl!). Thus, \"Prom Night\" isn't TOO bad a teen/slasher flick; certainly better than some I've seen. If anything, the film demonstrates that disco music is good for something after all: It makes an impressive backdrop for watching a psycho go berserk!",

Halloween, the film that this and many others like it use as a blueprint, wasn't all that interesting for me; but if watching Halloween is the cinematic equivalent of watching paint dry, then watching Prom Night is the equivalent of watching dried paint. Like John Carpenter's film, this one takes its plot and title from an important event in the American calendar - prom night, obviously. Thankfully, prom night isn't a big thing here in the UK, which puts this on the back foot with me right from the start. We did actually have a prom night in the final year at my high school; and even though I didn't go to it, I'm pretty sure that it was nothing like the one here. Prom Night features a bunch of twenty-something's masquerading as sixteen year olds. The film starts off with a hugely unoriginal sequence that sees a bunch of little kids kill another one. We fast forward six years and it's time for the high school prom...however, those obscene phone calls that the girls have been getting could prove deadly...The only reason why this film hasn't been forgotten along with most of the rest of the eighties slashers is due to the presence of 'Scream Queen' Jamie Lee Curtis. Curtis sleepwalks through the film, just like she did in Halloween; and it's more than obvious that she isn't too bothered about her performance, and the people behind the film are only interested in the fact that they can use her name on the poster. The only other name in the cast belongs to Leslie Nielson. It's bizarre seeing him in a slasher flick after he made his name with Zucker comedies; but that bizarre element is the only thing worth mentioning about his performance. The film is amazingly slow paced, and it's very easy to get thoroughly bored with it. The killings are very dull, and as the gore doesn't really start until the end anyway; there's a good chance that you'll be too jaded to even notice when it does. This film will appeal to people who (for some reason) really, really like slashers; but everyone else is advised to stay clear. As mentioned, I don't rate Halloween very highly; but it's a masterpiece compared to this.",

A young girl they were picking on falls out the top window to her death. The kids decide to keep quiet about their involvement in the incident. They don't know that someone was there and saw everything that happened. Fifteen years later, it's prom night at the high school and all those kids are now grown up getting ready to graduate. A mysterious, unseen person starts calling all of the people that were involved in the little girl's death years ago, spooking each of them. Soon after, most of the teenagers start getting murdered during prom. Most of the deaths are in the actual school when no one is around. All of this leading up to a well done ending which reveals the killer's identity.This is what the 80's were about. This disco music, the dancing, the fashion! It's just a great 80's horror film. The disco/music score is amazing. Prom Night is known as a slasher flick, but I would say it's more of a murder mystery. We actually have to guess who the killer is. There are actually quite a few suspects. The deaths were probably well done, but on the DVD versions, the quality is so poor you can barely make out who is who. Jamie Lee Curtis and the late Leslie Nielsen rock their roles of course. However another actress, Eddie Benton, adds real energy to the film also as the vixen Wendy.The killer dresses in all black including a black ski mask with cut out eye holes. His main (and only) weapon is a large axe. The one particular chase scene is Wendy's. He chases her around the interior of the darkened school for a good ten minutes. There are some really tense scenes as the killer pops out of everywhere trying to kill her with his wielding axe. The film location of the dark high school at night really add a spooky feeling to the movie. It's amazing.All of the characters are root-able. You really feel for most of them, even the vicious Wendy. The poor girl gets chased around the classrooms for so long, you almost want her to make it out of the movie alive.

Unlike most Hollywood horror/slasher movies, it did what most of the latter cannot, which is provide a combination of good lucks and good acting, therefor ensuring we care about the characters.Scream most definitely took a page from this movie as inspiration for its mystery theme. Though the budget was low and this movie was made in 1980 I feel that it still has enough of a story to keep us entertained and also enough of a punch to make us jump a bit. But what really makes Prom Night a success is its actors. Jamie Leigh was wonderful as always, but one character I felt that stole the show was the character of Wendy. As vile and wicked as they made her, the actress portraying her gave her depth. I felt as a viewer that she was more than just the typical bitch character. With killer lines, a beautiful face, and a chase scene that has been the foundation of future horror movie chase scenes, this girl makes the movie worth watching.If you happen to see this movie on or notice it in a video store I would suggest giving it a look. I would love to see a remake, ONLY if they kept the plot the same, but intensified the horror, much like what was done in TTCM remake.

The opening hour of Prom Night is a flabby unfocused mess that sets up a bunch of red hearings and plot cul-de-sacs and aside from a few phone calls nothing all that scary actually happens.What elevates Prom Night to watchable is some good acting, tradecraft, and a third act that finally allows the movie to be entertaining after spinning it's wheels for 70% of its running time. Jamie Lee Curtis while held back by not being allowed to be an active protagonist in the story thanks to her being unaware of the events and not that target of the killer still has the same commanding screen presence from her role as Laurie Strode in Halloween. Leslie Nielsen is also good in a pre Frank Drebin performance and is good as grieving father Mr. Hammond. The movie's third act where the killer becomes more active leads to some fun chases and kills, including a final confrontation on a disco floor that while not scary, is still visually interesting and a lot of fun to watch. Unfortunately the movie ends on a rather depressing note that's also heavily telegraphed and sours the impressions of the previous half hour.Prom Night is a slasher film. Not a good one, not a bad one. It's a slasher film that feels like it's checking the needed boxes for what audiences want and presents them as is. It has a decent look to it and builds to an fun climax, but a lack of interesting characters or any semblance of agency among them make this a turgid affair that just doesn't cut it when compared to its contemporaries.",

The premise of Prom Night and many of the slasher is taken right from Halloween's playbook. However, the lack of creative in the script is made up in other areas of the film. Jamie Lee Curtis performance is a stellar reminder when she is the top Scream Queen, it was a complete transformation from past characters while maintaining a likable, believable character. The surrounding cast were all unique characters too and didn't bring down the movie with poor performances.

The story is kinda simple and seems to be an older version of \"I Know What You Did Last Summer\"-- but even worse. Some kids 'accidentaly' murder one guy (or girl, it's so annoying that I can't remember) and make a promise that they'll never tell anyone about it. Then, when they're going to their prom, this murdered child sets a revenge and tries to kill them all. I can't tell you if the rebel child accomplished it's will, since I couldn't make it to the end. There is simply NOTHING to make the spectator care about the film, so you can imagine how boring it gets. \"Prom Night\"'s 2006 version is very bad reviewed on internet, so I thought that seeing this version would be more pleasant, but I really doubt that remake can be any worse than this.

The movie tries to set some tension earlier on like with the mirror breaking and what not, but then the movie loses all tension when you decide to have Jamie Lee Curtis do a full disco routine half way through the movie. Completely took me out. I didn't find any of the characters really interesting. They're pretty cliched for the most part. And I also understand this movie had a smaller budget but Halloween for example had an even smaller budget and manages to look a lot better than this film. This film literally looks like it was filmed with a potato. And was there ANY lighting design? Honestly good luck trying to follow along what's happening in any of the dark scenes. The only thing I found mildly interesting was the ending. I still think I hate the remake more (mostly because the characters were more idiotic and annoying).

First of all, after a creepy opening sequence, detailing the cruel, yet accidental death of an innocent girl, the movie CRAWWWWWLLLLSSSSS... In other films of it's genre, such as the superior Friday the 13th series, the murders are usually evenly spread throughout the film, setting the tone for a climactic ending. Not here. The first hour of Prom Night seems like it could be from some long forgotten 70's after school special. \nSecondly, it amazed me how much this movie has in common with Jennifer Love Hewitt's hit \"I Know What You Did Last Summer\". Both movies feature a group of characters that accidentally kill an innocent, then act irrationally as they attempt to avoid blame. They bully each other into promising never to talk about the death ever again. At some future point (one year later in IKWYDLS, six years later in Prom Night...) all the participants receive threatening reminders of their crime as a precursor to the actual murders. Makes me wonder if the producers of IKWYDLS didn't INTENTIONALLY steal the plot, and just change the particulars. At any rate, Jamie Lee Curtis is always welcome in these slasher films, (even though she looks a little old to play a high school student) and Leslie Nielsen plays the principal of the school whom happens to be Jamie's father. It's not bad as early 80's slasher go, as the killings (especially the punk whom gets beheaded...) are fairly graphic, but the slow pace really lessens the impact of the entire film. Also, is it just me, or does the disco music being played at the prom sound like outtakes from an Abba recording session?",

Years later, a ski masked killer plots revenge on the same kids, at their high school prom. This was one of my favorite slashers when I was younger. It was one of the first movies my Mother ever bought me. Jamie Lee Curtis is my favorite actress of all time, and I'll watch anything with her in it. It does hold some special value to me, I've seen it many times, but watching it as a 28 year old, makes me realize how mundane and mediocre this movie is. I still love slasher movies, but there is nothing special about this movie at all. It has a chilling opening. Unfortunately, it's all downhill from there. Nothing all that interesting commences. It lacks suspense, it has lame 80's disco music, and it's filled with really talky scenes. I do like the added touch of the threatening phone calls. A few of them were somewhat creepy, but other than that, nothing to write home about. Watching it at this day and age makes me wonder if the plot drew inspiration for I Know What You Did Last Summer? The set-up is a bit similar, without all the drama IKWYDLS had. It also throws in the very clich\u00e9d \"Escaped lunatic as a suspect\" storyline, and like always. It turns out to be a complete lie. They fill it with your lovable 80's slasher clich\u00e9s, such as the token stoner, the jealous rival of a prom queen, bumbling cops, among other things. The acting is fairly amateurish, aside from a couple people. A couple of the actors (Leslie Nielsen included) do this weird inner monologue thing. Jamie Lee Curtis outshines everyone so much. She is a prime example of a scream queen. In fear of being type-casted, she moved away from horror movies, but she was a natural at it. She has a very thin part, and not much to work with. Jamie Lee Curtis manages to make the most out of it with sheer talent. She livened up the movie whenever she was on screen. Casey Stevens is a little bland as Nick, but I enjoyed his dated curly hair. Leslie Nielsen is wasted as a principal. I'm not sure why he was in this movie to begin with. The rest of the cast are mostly amateurish, but Anne-Marie Martin is pretty good as a vindictive witch. The gore is drier than your Grandma's snatch. We get a lame slit throat, and a decapitation, along with some light blood splashing. The killer himself isn't completely predictable, but it wasn't exactly a surprise either. He made these weird noises as well. The ending is anti-climatic tooFinal Thoughts: This isn't much better than the nominal remake of this movie. It's rather dull and often bloodless as well. I had fond memories of this movie, but not any more. Jamie Lee Curtis's talents were more suited for something better. If you wanna see JLC give a classic performance in a slasher, watch the first two Halloween movies. Followed by three sequels 4.1/10",

They one by one start to receive menacing phone calls...I first saw this and expected to see a C grade slasher movie- one of the many mediocre movies made in the wake of Halloween.Boy, was I wrong! There's loads to love about this movie. Firstly, Jamie Lee Curtis is in it. Shes such a great actress that if shes on the cast list you can expect a stunning performance. Not only is she another kick arse Final Girl but we also get to see her disco moves. She also has a great exchange with the school bitch. This features some fantastically camp lines ('Its not who takes you to the prom. Its about who takes you home!') Jamie wins and has the last word in this verbal volley naturally.Another great feature of this film is that its actually very scary in the appropriate scenes. The killer ringing the teenagers one by one is a scene so threatening and jarring that its a sequence that is one of the scariest I've ever seen in any horror film. The simplicity of the scene (just a hand, a pencil, the list of names and the phone) is extremely effective and downright chilling.The film is also brilliantly chilling as it touches on the subject of paedophilia- a local sex offender is known to the police and they think he is the reason for the dead little girl. They hound him to such a degree that he crashes his car which bursts into flames. The police had no evidence that it was him but hey, hes so disfigured that he now can't commit anymore crimes and is placed in an asylum.\u00a0And there are the actual kills and the scenes they are contained within which are directed with aplomb. These are very tense and unnerving. OK so this certainly isn't John Carpenter's Halloween but these scenes are still very good for a slasher movie.\u00a0With Halloween being a major influence on this film there are also the atypical scenes of the female characters talking about, y'know, girls things- boys, hair, going to the prom etc etc. In fact in the book Blood Money it has been suggested that there were two types of advertising for this film- one that dwelt on the themes thought to be more appealing to a young female demographic (the disco music, the relationships and drama within the film) and one that dwelt on what was thought to appeal to the guys- namely the tension, suspense and kills.\u00a0The film really does feel like a cross between Halloween, Carrie (the prom setting and the potential for carnage in this setting) and Saturday Night Fever- this film has disco stomps and a brilliant disco soundtrack that strangely provides a brilliant and sinister backdrop to the murders.\u00a0Another great feature is that of the character of Slick. Just like the bawdy British comedies of the 1970's featured the most unlikely candidates for male eye-candy who somehow get the women, so does this film. Slick thinks hes a modern day babe magnet. I'll leave it up to you to agree or disagree with his self perception.This movie also has one of the most hilarious characters in horror history- look out for Mr Sykes played by Robert Silverman (he would also appear in Scanners and Jason X). Is he the killer or a far too obvious red herring?Prom Night is far too good than a Halloween rip-off slasher movie deserves to be. If Halloween is A+ then Prom Night is B+If you're going to buy this film please look out for the Region 1 Blu ray from Synapse Films.

            "content": "Prom Night came out at the height of the slasher film parade in the late 1970s/early 1980s initiated by the one-two punch of Halloween and Friday the 13th. It also had the distinction of being headlined by the reigning scream queen of the era, Jamie Lee Curtis. Nowadays, some of its attributes are certainly not as novel (especially after Scream), but one most really give kudos where due in that it did put its own spin on the genre without ever getting due credit. The film opens with the accidental death of a young girl during a hide-and-seek-type game that spins drastically out of control. The perpetrators agree never to reveal their culpability and the victim's family, high school principal dad Leslie Nielsen, edgy wife Antoinette Bower and their surviving children (later played by Curtis and Michael Tough), are suitably shell-shocked. Years later on prom night, a killer begins targeting those responsible and anyone who accidentally gets in the way of the quest for vengeance. For a slasher film, the end product has its moments of dread, but is surprisingly fun (some of the more humorous moments restored to the TV print actually enhance the affability of the film as a whole). Unlike its precursors, Prom Night was arguably the first slasher flick wherein the killer was both not an unkillable monster and whose identity was hidden until the climax, so it became the first to combine elements of mystery in the mix. And there are a fair enough share of suspects to keep the average viewer wondering (is it Nielsen's too-good to be true dad, Bower's unhinged mother, Tough's brooding brother, the escaped nut, the creepy janitor, another minor character, or perhaps even one of the original perpetrators suffering a guilt trip?). Ironically, it is also interesting that lead Curtis never appears to be an intended target, but the filmmakers never suggest the possibility that she could be the killer. Cast is uniformly strong, despite some of them looking a good 10 years beyond high school age. It is also a stretch to imagine that three of the perpetrators would end up being best friends and boyfriend to the sister of a girl they inadvertently killed (wouldn't they have avoided her?). A pre-Naked Gun Nielsen provides some much-needed gravity, although he vanishes for most of the second half. Curtis is classy as always. Casey Stevens is appealing as her conscience-stricken boyfriend. Anne-Marie Martin (then Eddie Benton) deserves special praise expertly playing one of the most repellent and arrogant shrews to populate horror films - the kind of character so noxious (and well-played) that one must hang in just to see her get it. A really great job on her part. The deaths are grisly without being stomach-churning and there are at least two really suspenseful drawn-out chase scenes. The ending is a bit of a downer, but this film is definitely one of the better entries in the genre. Sadly the recent in-name-only PG-13 remake has neither the style nor the effect of this one.",

Six years later & it's the day of Alexander Hamilton Senior High School's prom, everyone is excited especially Robin's sister Kim Hammond (Jamie Lee Curtis) who is going to be the prom queen. However several of the students get strange phone-calls as a killer sets their plans into motion, a killer who know's the identity of young Robin's killers & wants to dish out to revenge...This Canadian production was directed by Paul Lynch & is an obvious cash-in on the teen slasher genre that doing so well back then after huge hits like Halloween (1978) & Friday the 13th (1980) & this dreary effort is surely one of the most forgettable slashers out there despite being fairly well known & puzzlingly quite well regarded. I have no idea why Prom Night is so well liked or even remembered at all since it's a throughly dull & routine film that fails to deliver the goods, the script is so slow it feels like hours before anything happens & the murder mystery elements are poorly handled as is the eventual reveal of the killers identity as to be honest once the balaclava came off I didn't actually recognise who they were & since they never say anything I was left slightly puzzled as to who the killer was. There's no great twist, there are a few red herrings thrown in like a strict principal, a grieving mother, a sinister caretaker, a school bully, a disfigured child molester & so on but they are all far too obvious to be the killer. The character's are all poor, there's far too much dead time when nothing happens & the film shamelessly rips-off better slashers like Halloween with it's event themed title, Carrie (1976) with it's prom setting & Black Christmas (1974) with the killer using a phone to taunt their victims while not being as good as any of them.Even the body count is disappointing, it takes a good hour or so before the on screen kill occurs & it's a fairly tame & bloodless affair with all but one of the kills off-screen. There's a bit of blood splatter & a decent enough decapitation but nothing memorable. There's a little sex but again nothing memorable, there's no nudity either apart from a quick flash of a bare bum. When Prom Night premiered on NBC in the US they filmed & added several additional scenes including Mr. Hammond using the axe to chop wood that the killer later uses, maybe this version is better but I can only assume most of the extra footage would have been padding & slowed things down even more. There are also quite a few unintentionally amusing scenes of teenagers disco dancing to some truly awful music & Leslie Nielsen joining in at one point. There's no great thrills or chills here & the whole film is flatly shot & rather dull to watch.With what was probably a fairly low budget Prom Night looks alright but has no great visual style, apparently filmed at Don Mills Collegiate in Toronto in Canada. The acting is average, Jamie Lee Curtis looks bored after already appearing in the similar Halloween a couple of years earlier while Leslie Nielsen probably needed the money.Prom Night is a pretty poor 80's slasher that has a measly body count, a lacklustre murder mystery plot & a Snail's. Followed by the unconnected but in name only sequels Hello Mary Lou: Prom Night II (1987), Prom Night III: The Last Kiss (1990) & Prom Night IV: Deliver Us from Evil (1992) before being recently remade as Prom Night (2008).",

Each of them can be enjoyed, in general, provided the right sense of humor and mindset. But honestly, Prom Night is unique in the field of horror: it's really just unpleasantly bad. It has some obviously funny \"bad\" moments, but it's as if the punchlines fall flat or are completely forgotten. It doesn't have anything really scary. It's like listening to that one kid go, \"Hey, want to hear a funny joke? A guy walks into a bar, and the bartender says... oh wait, wait, I messed it up. Okay, no, so the bartender is bartending when he sees this guy... no wait.\" Jamie Lee Curtis. Apparently, if her early slasher flicks are any indication, you never want to meet her brother. In this case, however, you wouldn't have to be so fretful. Jamie Lee herself doesn't factor into the equation as much as you'd think, and honestly if you're afraid of a bumbling guy dressed up like a ninja with an axe, then you deserve to run yourself into a corner like these characters do constantly. (On retrospect, \"bumbling guy dressed up like a ninja with an axe\" actually sounds a lot more cool than it ends up being in this movie. Maybe that's it's problem: it has a decent concept that was later ripped off by I Know What You Did Last Summer, but even when it had good things going for it it failed).Honestly, what makes this movie a curiosity to me is the fact that it's held as such a classic of cult horror slasher movies. After all, I understand the idea behind that cult and enjoy myself some horror movies of all types, bad or good. But this might as well have been one of those video productions that immediately went out of print six months after its release and disappeared into some vault, maybe to be resurrected by Troma twenty years later and sold in a dollar bin as kitsch. Instead, it's basically the worst well-known slasher flick from back-when I've ever seen.And that's just on the liminal horror movie level, with scares or humor or much of anything. On a completely different level, ugly people, bad music, terrible sets, over-exposure, and disgusting costume and art design honestly make this movie uncomfortable to watch through sheer tackiness. It's easy to see that it's a cheap production, and to a limited degree can be forgiven for that. But they obviously paid at least some money for those costumes and sets, and somebody was behind the camera at some point who probably shouldn't have been. It's honestly really hard to watch this movie because the imagery itself is just aesthetically bad.--PolarisDiB",

            "content": "Another average slasher flick, one of two that scream queen Jamie Lee Curtis made back to back during her time in Canada fresh from her fame in John Carpenter's Halloween in 1978. It opens with four young kids in an abandoned building playing a macarible game when one girl joins them and it leads to her accidently falling out of a second floor window to her death. The four kids (three girls and a boy) make a pack never to mention it to anyone. But six years later, someone knows about the killing and decides to get those four responsible. As it also happens the anniversary of the death coincides with the big high school prom which the kids are all attending, making it convenient to borrow big ideas from movies like Carrie (1976) among others for the characters, situations and subplots.Although it has some good qualities and was moderately successful when first released, the movie is bloodless in almost every respect, plus the murders are so murky and dimly lit. Jamie Lee Curtis, playing Kim, the older sister of the murdered young girl, is good as the popular student who wants to be elected prom queen. But she, unfortunatly, is not one of the four students targeted by the masked ax-weilding killer. In fact, she frequently becomes a suspect along with her father the school principal, as well as her younger brother Alex, the creepy school janitor, and the school bully.  But the identity of the killer is fairly obvious. But so much time is spent on establishing red herrings that more than two-thirds of the movie pass before any of the killings begin. The production values are also good, but the film is starting to show its age.Contents: Six killings, scant blood, one decapitation, Jamie Lee Curtis as prom queen, no nudity, no real suspense, no pace, lots of disco music and dancing, sit this one out.",

This is bloody good fun regardless the total lack of originality, and the shameless use of every possible clich\u00e9 you can think of only increases the fun-factor. The long disco sequences might make you fear that you accidentally rented a copy of \"Saturday Night Fever\" but that finally changes once the black-masked killer violently slays his first beauty-queen. Many others follow and the connection between them refers to a deadly incident that took place 6 years earlier. Someone is out to avenge the death of a small girl and prom-queen-to-be Jamie Lee Curtis and her friends will experience the night of their lives! The murders are graphically shown and belong to the vilest of all 80's slashers. The decapitation scene near the end is pure classic in my book. Good acting and decent production values for this type of cinema, too. There's also the terrific usage of the abandoned school building and there's even a tad bid of female nudity to enjoy. My only real complaint is about the dreadful disco-music that never seems to stop! You'd go on a bloody killing spree for less reasons than that.",

            "content": "Starring then scream-queen (and current yogurt peddler) Jamie Lee Curtis and a pre-goofball Leslie Nielsen, \"Prom Night\" is one of the first in what would be many holiday-themed slasher flicks meant to capitalize on the success of John Carpenter's seminal \"Halloween.\" The concept is at once simple and yet convoluted: a gaggle of tweens playing a rather odd and slightly sadistic \"hide and go seek\"-type game in an abandoned warehouse accidentally drive another child to their death. Because it's always a good idea in this sort of movie, the kids all vow never to speak a word of this to anyone. Fast- forward six years later, and the kids are now teenagers getting ready for their prom. Only somebody saw what happened that fateful day, and somebody is going to make them pay.Like its fellow brethren in \"My Bloody Valentine,\" \"Prom Night\" is a low-budget production straight out of Canada. Director Paul Lynch works the meager concept into a rather sleek and efficient blaze of tension, bloodshed and disco. For better or worse, not much blood is shed until about 2/3 of the way through the movie. For at least the first half of the movie, we are treated to a lot of obscene phone calls, botched hook-ups in locker rooms and student-on-student pranks. There's also adequate time to set-up the somewhat stock characters, which is handled surprisingly well. Jamie Lee Curtis sticks out from the bunch as the innocent by-stander who, before becoming the de-facto survivor girl, gets to bust out in an obscenely long dance-number that almost gives a similar scene in \"Airplane\" a run for its money. The kill scenes are then, somewhat ironically, less memorable than all the stuff that comes before it, which is perhaps a testament to Lynch's unheralded skill or maybe just dumb luck.Either way, \"Prom Night\" is a great example of the '80s slasher. All the tropes you've come to expect -- revenge, premarital relations, bratty teens, recreational drug-use -- it's all here. Perhaps not as refined as its predecessors, \"Prom Night\" remains an entertaining and somewhat endearing experience all these years later. It even inspired a pair of silly yet throroughly entertaining sequels in \"Prom Night II: Hello Mary Lou\" and \"Prom Night III: The Last Kiss,\" along with a somewhat forgettable fourth film and an absolute piece of garbage remake. But if you're looking to hit the dance floor with a well- worn semi-classic of its era, you couldn't pick a better date than the original \"Prom Night.\"",

This one also features a traumatic event in the prologue, with the assailant being someone who witnessed it and is out for vengeance, a la \"I Know What You Did Last Summer\".Don't let the familiarity of the material put you off, though. \"Prom Night\" is a very well made movie: the death scenes, particularly, make unnerving use of slow motion and camera angles that would have been truly disturbing back in 1980.

On the one hand, it's more artsy than any of the Halloween or Friday the 13th movies and contains less gore than most of them, so I can see why it may have alienated audiences. But on the other hand, it's still a slasher film with characters that, though likable, are not fleshed out all that well (in the theatrical version, at least-I understand some of the scenes reinstated in the TV version fixed this), so I can see why it may have alienated critics (Roger Ebert said it should be \"cut up to make bookmarks\").Where do I fit in on all of this? I thought it was pretty good, as slasher movies go, but I lament the cutting of character development scenes that might have made the characters more relatable. It's not of the gross-out variety of slasher films, like many of the Friday the 13th films, and the whole idea of the protagonists being \"punished\" for drinking, drugs, and having sex (as with many slasher films) is downplayed here, which I thought made it more original. It also has a killer with a much better motive than most slasher films, and the reveal of who it is was originally done, and the script is loaded with false leads and red herrings. Just when we think we know where it's going, it shocks you.Prom Night is shot and edited with a style absent from most of its slasher cousins, including the original Halloween (which I always found overrated), which probably made it more of an art house release than audiences and critics were expecting, thus probably why there weren't a million sequels to it-just not enough interest. I haven't seen the sequels that *were* made, and I don't particularly want to, because I found this one pretty satisfying and left no loose ends.If you think a slasher movie is measured by the depravity of its violence and gore, you may not like this, but if you go into a slasher movie hoping for something more interesting, you may.",

The script seems much more concerned with day to day mundane character interactions and little high school melodramas than any real thrills or slashing, but, in some ways, that's part of its charm.At a time when the slasher genre was just starting to take off, the rules weren't set in stone yet and a lot of these movies didn't know that it helps to have a few deaths before the hour mark. Somehow, Prom Night makes the best of this and takes a few amusing (and not-so-amusing detours) before providing us with the expected violent final act.Some of the characterizations and performances aren't half bad with special props going to Eddie Benton as the wicked Wendy who, somehow, manages to make her witch of a character compelling. It's hard not to root for her during the film's home stretch where she puts up quite a fight against the killer. Much has been made of Jamie Lee Curtis' appearance in this film, but she really doesn't have much to do and almost completely disappears several times during the film. She does get to cap off the film with an incredibly emotional (and unique, for this genre) sequence.",

But like all good horrors, there is a back story which sets up the reason for the killings, in this case, the motif is purely revenge.Four childhood friends who would later grow up to be the school's nice boy, diva, meek girl and geek girl, were all involved in the death of another young girl. That girl is the sister of Jamie Lee Curtis' character, Kim. And, as Prom Night approaches, someone is hunting down those four former friends.Jamie Lee Curtis is obviously the main reason to watch this film, but \"Prom Night\" is not without other good points. The idea of a murderer prowling around on Prom Night is great, the music is very cool, especially the song on the closing credits. Oh, and Jamie Lee Curtis sure can dance! The rest of the cast are pretty good. Leslie Nielson's involvement is minimal, though Antionette Bower is wasted. Pita Oliver, David Mucci, Casey Stevens and Anne-Marie Martin as the school diva are especially note worthy.",

            "content": "\"Prom Night\" is one of the horror films that is highly underrated. What this film has that most horror films from the 80's generation (including some from these past two generations) do not take the time to develop is a strong plot with good character development. Of course these come with good screen writing. Having said that, as a consequence the viewer actually has to sit through a building story, which takes a while to build up. Therefore about 50 minutes of the film is dedicated solely to that. But that's not to say there aren't any moments of suspense or slight uneasiness. But during the prom sequence the film has a tendency to lose track of the fact that it is a horror film, and so there may come a time during the film that you'll ask yourself \"what is it I'm watching again?\" There are a few possibilities as to who could be doing the killings and why, but the revelation was a bit predictable and if you pay close attention to the film there are actually intentional hints dropped. This I found to be quite clever. Also, most horror movies don't leave the audience on a sad not but this one actually did, something rare to find in a horror film, and it was nice to see.Those who are expecting a horror film with excessive gore scenes will not find it in this horror film. For Paul Lynch's \"Prom Night\" it is mostly what you do not see that makes you cringe.\"Prom Night\" runs approximately 89 minutes in length, and should at least be considered as a rental. \"Prom Night\" is not a forgettable horror movie, and has memorable moments. Roughly 39 minutes of the film will keep you on edge and entertained, especially during Kelly's chase scene. Whilst the other 50 minutes will keep you for the most part intrigued. ***1/2 Stars Out of *****",

Prom Night is one of the earliest of the Halloween clones and one of the most unique in that there's precious little bloodshed and that doesn't even happen until about an hour into the film. For some, this will be a huge negative, but Prom Night doesn't play like your average slasher film. For most of its run time, it feels more like a well made TV movie mystery of the week. The filmmakers seem more interested in characters and drama than slashing and that's a nice change of pace.Although she's top billed, Jamie Lee Curtis doesn't have a whole lot to do in the film, which feels more like an ensemble piece than anything else. Curtis is definitely good and is especially effective during the finale where she gets to defend herself (and others) from the killer with an ax and do some pretty serious Greek tragedy emoting.Eddie Benton is probably the MVP here as Wendy - the beautiful, spoiled rich b*$ch. As awful as Wendy can be, Benton is able to add a few layers to her character to garner some sympathy.",

Now, prom night is falling on the anniversary of her death and someone wants to get revenge for her.While sold as a Jamie Lee Curtis vehicle after the success of Halloween, Prom Night is much more of an ensemble piece and, thankfully, our young actors are a likable and charming bunch who make spending time with them worthwhile. This is good, too, since Prom Night doesn't get to any slashing until almost an hour into the movie. For many, this is a huge deal breaker, but it's refreshing to see a horror film more concerned with the characters than the blood and guts.Once the blood (and disco music) starts rolling, the pacing does improve and it's a breeze to the finale. It also features one of the best executed chase sequences you're liable to see in a slasher film.

Who could the murderer be? The weirdo working as a handyman at the high school? The disfigured sex offender originally blamed for the girl's death? The dead girl's father (played by Leslie Nielsen) Or someone else? Seriously, it's not hard to figure out who killer is, so the film doesn't even work as a whodunit. No atmosphere, very little splatter (a decapitation is the only decent death; the rest is too dark to make out), the barest minimum of T&A, a simple to solve mystery, and Jamie Lee grooving it up on the disco floor: hardly the stuff that nightmares are made of.4.5 out of 10, generously rounded up to 5 for IMDb.",

I couldn't recall why, so recently when I acquired a free copy of the DVD as a gift I decided to watch it a second time. Well, now that makes a total of three hours of my lifetime that I shall never get back; PROM NIGHT is still a terrible film, and easily one of the worst and most unsatisfying entries in the early '80s Splatter Genre. At only 89 minutes in length, nothing occurs until one hour into it (I actually watched my counter to make sure I noticed the timing, and it was almost exactly at the 1:00 mark). Jamie Lee Curtis was cast in the movie because of her status at the time as a \"horror queen\" after the successful HALLOWEEN, but she's pretty much reduced to window dressing here. Insanely, the actor who receives top billing is none other than good old Leslie Nielsen, but he must have been doing it to pay off a couple of overdue phone bills or something, as he's only in it briefly, and in scenes that have nothing much to do with anything. And that pretty much sums up the whole show in itself... it's just a lot of unrelated scenes of nothing, all adding up to a load of nothing (what's with those padded police investigations?). It's not hard to figure out who the killer is either, and if you're a fan of this type of slaughter film, let me assure you that there are many other places to locate more effective chop-'em-up mayhem and gore; this limp rag is D.O.A. - 0 out of ****",

Strange to see how films like I KNOW WHAT YOU DID LAST SUMMER are still using the same clich\u00e9s even now, perhaps in twenty years time we'll be watching yet more blonde girls getting stalked through corridors by mad people...Still, as an example of its type, you could do a lot worse, and at least this presents a nice variety of clich\u00e9s for us to enjoy, such as (deep breath): an escaped lunatic who kidnapped a nurse, cf. HALLOWEEN; some threatening phone calls, cf. BLACK Christmas; a weird cleaner as a main suspect; teenagers having sex and then getting killed, cf. just about any slasher film in existence! Although filmed on a low budget in Canada, the film succeeds by building up lots of red herrings and potential murderers in the cast, before bumping off half a dozen teens in the last third (although it's never explained why the fat guy in the van gets murdered when he had nothing to do with the original accident).The cast is mainly populated by nobodies, headlined by two stars; one up-and-coming girl, one middle-aged actor going through a lean patch in his career; that is, Jamie Lee Curtis and Leslie Nielsen. Curtis was typed as a screaming heroine at this time, having appeared in HALLOWEEN, TERROR TRAIN, and THE FOG, to name but three, and here she performs perfectly adequately - apart from her embarrassing moves on the disco floor, which should have been consigned to cutting room history! It's difficult to watch Nielsen acting seriously - you expect him to start blowing things up accidentally or killing people in a comic fashion. He looks as if he doesn't want to be in this film, and he actually isn't...near the end, he suddenly disappears, never to be heard of again! Where did Nielsen go? One minute he's dancing, the next...people are looking for him but to no avail! Was this some secret hint that there was actually a conspiracy involved that night - and maybe Nielsen was a second murderer? Or maybe the budget ran low and the producers had to quickly ditch the most expensive star.For a slasher film, there are surprisingly few deaths, and most of the film's running time is padded out with endless conversions about the prom, some low lifes at the school fighting, drugs, sex, flashing, and girls putting make up on. Not to mention some obvious spooky scenes, like a window smashing suddenly and nobody being there. When the deaths do come, they're pretty simplistic and disappointing - some blood, throat slashings, nothing spectacular apart from a flying severed rubber head moment at the end of the film (pretty funny, but not exactly worth waiting for). The killer dresses entirely in black and wears a balaclava; personally he reminded me more of a ninja than a murderer.PROM NIGHT was a moderate success, spawning three unrelated sequels to date. There are a few effective stalk and slash moments in the film to enjoy, but not really much horror content. If you want the blueprints of the genre then it's probably a good idea to go with the two most popular slasher films which were responsible for all of these imitations: HALLOWEEN and Friday the 13th (themselves influenced by many other pictures, I know). Or even something gory like THE BURNING. This film falls about the middle of the scale of slasher film quality.",

The suspense sequences work well and the disco scenes are great fun.Jamie Lee Curtis (it was her sister who died) is not one of the slated victims but is closely associated with them. Her character works well due to Curtis' acting ability, charisma, and disco dancing skills. Anne-Marie Martin as the scheming Wendy is especially good. Wendy is a great character and Martin is fantastic in the role. The extended sequence where the killer pursues her is a real highlight. Casey Stevens as Nick is also good.The empty school at night is scene of the stalkings and murders. The location is well used to create suspense. Having the deaths play out under the distant disco beats is a cool touch. The killer has a sleek black outfit and stealthy moves which is a very important thing to get right in these films.Some slasher fans will be disappointed at the lack of nudity, blood and gore.

And yet, \"Prom Night\" stands out for one reason alone: the character \"Slick,\" played by one Sheldon Rybowski. Here were the same too-cute teeny-bopper slasher-fodder, most of whom deserved to be slashed, and here comes a chubby, geeky kid with a van, ready for lovin'.

            "content": "Years after a terrible tragedy, a group of teens partying away at their high-school prom find themselves stalked by a murderous killer in retribution for their actions earlier and must stop his blood-soaked rampage.Overall this was a very disjointed and problematic slasher. One of the many problems facing this one is that the central motivation for the rampage is quite shoddy and rather lame, centering on the initial game in the beginning which runs for far too long and comes off as far too clich\u00e9d to have the impact it should have. When this part of the film is problematic, it certainly undoes this one a lot by coming up with a lame game that sets off a clich\u00e9d reaction which doesn't have all that much impact here because of that clich\u00e9d nature. As well, this here really undercuts the film itself as there's barely anything which can count itself as enjoyable slasher fare as a lot of these scenes are lame, drawn-out and pack almost zero suspense into them. There's very little of the really creepy type of scenes all throughout this, as the chase through the school hallways is just awfully overlong, clumsy and doesn't really feature anything to show her life's at stake so it just comes off as a bland, tedious scene from a film full of them, including the opening game and the sequences with the police attempts to catch the red herring which are supposed to be creepy or chilling but doesn't have anything worthwhile to add to the film. That would be enough to lower this one enough even without the utterly excruciating fact of this one being shot so dark that it makes for an extremely difficult to near- impossible time just making out what's actually happening at the time. It's blurry, dark and just doesn't kook all that appealing which really highlights the flaws even more as there's hardly anything that sticks out when it can't be seen all that well. There's a few good ideas here, though, that does work including the fact that the film sets up four different people as the killer and gives them each a fair amount of time to make people think is the real killer, which is really ingenious. Two people involved in subplots as being potential killers are given perhaps the most realistic killer motives that it's surprising none of them were the killer. The other thing about this one that works is the final twenty minutes in the film, as that is when all the murders take place as the rest is the prom set up. All of the deaths are all packed in at the ending, which leaves the ending to pack a giant wallop. Otherwise, there's not a whole lot of enjoyable stuff here.Rated R: Graphic Violence, Adult Language, Nudity, and a scene of Rape.",

            "content": "1st watched 9/25/2011 -- 2 out of 10(Dir-Paul Lynch): Boring horror movie that doesn't have much going for it unless you're interested in seeing a late 20's Jamie Lee Curtis try to pull off a highschooler going to her first prom. She also gets to show off some pretty nice disco moves on the dance floor, but this was supposed to be a horror movie not a rip-off of \"Saturday Night Fever.\" When the horror stuff finally starts, at about 3/4 of the way thru the movie, we're already bored. The movie is basically about a girl accidentally falling to her death while a group of kids play a creepy killer-type game at an abandoned old house. The kids vow to not tell anyone, and a weirdo is charged with the death and serves a sentence in a mental institution. Six years later, the weirdo escapes from the institution and we are prompted into thinking he is the one preparing to murder the kids who were actually involved at the prom. The filmmakers introduce us to a creepy janitor and one of the girl's planning something evil for the event, but these are all smokescreens made very obvious to the viewer. I won't give away who eventually starts doing the killing, but you won't really care once it starts happening. The movie is also not shot very well with a lot of dark scenes, where it's hard to tell what's happening, and the sound was pretty bad on the DVD version I watched. This movie was obviously trying to make money from the Friday the 13th/Halloween movie trend, but I hope not too many people put up their money for this loser. The movie spawned three sequels, unbelievably, but I guess the premise is intriguing(younguns, sex, dancing and violence), but it wasn't intriguing enough for me to care about watching any of the sequels.",

            "review_title": "Boogie the Night Away",
            "content": "\"Prom Night\" is the second chapter of a trilogy of slasher films Jaime Lee Curtis star in early in her career. After \"Halloween\" and before \"Terror Train,\" Curtis lended her rising scream queen talent to this Canadian production, a minor classic for slasher fans. Coming so early in the sub-genre's life, \"Prom Night\" follows an expected slasher outline. A group of kids, while playing a game of Killer in an abandoned high school, indirectly lead to a fellow child's death. The police pin the murder on a pedophile. As the years pass, some of the children harbor guilt over the death, while others forget about it. A decade later on the eve of the same student's senior prom, the girls begin receiving threatening phone calls. The same child molester has escaped from prison and murdered a nun already. As prom begins and the kids boogie the night away, a masked man begins to hack his way through the guilty party.\"Prom Night\" takes a surprisingly long time to get to its murders. It's nearly an hour into the film before the deaths start to happen. For such a deliberate pace, you'd expect the characters to be more solidly developed. Most of the large cast aren't much more then loose ideas. Jaime Lee proves to be the final girl but she's not quite the protagonist. Curtis' Kim is mostly defined by her relationship with neurotic brother Alex. Her boyfriend Nick doesn't have much personality. Jerk Lou and bully Wendy seem to want to recreate the end of \"Carrie\" by hijacking the prom. Seymour is the required prankster character. Only Kelly, pushed by her boyfriend into having sex, has any sort of definable arc. She, of course, dies first.What joys there are to \"Prom Night\" come from Paul Lynch's frequently moody direction. He mines quite a bit of sinister intent out of long shots of empty high school hallways. The killer's first appearance is stretch out nicely, the death coming as a shock, the murder scene fading to red. The creepy phone calls are handled nicely, with extreme close-ups on a pencil thumping at a pad of paper. The ending is surprisingly sincere, playing the material for pathos instead of blatant shocks. While \"Prom Night\" doesn't quite earn that emotion, the attempt is still appreciated.The movie's camp factor is probably more entertaining. I hope you kids like disco because this movie is full of it. There are long sequences of cast members dancing to cheesy, canned dance music. Have you ever wanted to see a pre-comedy-career Leslie Nielson boogie his heart out? You've got it. The killer's sparkly ski-mask proves a somewhat comical disguise. Pre-dating \"Scream,\" the slasher is borderline incompetent. He gets beat up by a nerd. The hilarious van crash has little to do with the killer's attempt to sneak inside. He nearly forgets his axe during a chase scene. He routinely gets beaten and battered by the film's heroines. This is probably intentional, considering the murderer is just another teenager.\"Prom Night\" is hardly a gory film but what kills it has are quite clever. A shattered glass throat slashing is memorable. The van face stabbing generates a shock or two. The decapitation, the severed head landing on the day-glo dance floor, is darkly humorous. It's no surprise that \"Prom Night\" was a big hit in its day and would, years later, spawn the required slasher franchise. The movie's nothing special but I can see why slasher fans consider it nostalgic horror comfort food.",

Six years later it's prom night and a masked killer is after the four. This was an early example of the 80's slashers so that should be kept in mind when viewing this today as it really doesn't have too much in common with the better known slashers of the decade. The body count is pretty low and there isn't too much in the way of suspense but the biggest sin in this film is the fact that not much happens until the final twenty-minutes. I found this film incredibly slow moving and lifeless, which isn't good for a slasher. I also wasn't too thrilled with any of the performances and that includes Leslie Nielsen and Jamie Lee Curtis. The supporting teens aren't any good either with some of them being downright horrid. Another problem with the film is that it's hard to really feel anything for the four teens because of how mean spirited the original prank is. The \"killer\" chant that they do at the start of the film is rather effective but it also had me against the teens later on in the film. The direction by Peter Lynch is pretty bland as he brings no suspense or style to the movie. He also lingers on too many scenes including an extended disco sequence and another chase sequence that goes on way too long. All in all this is a pretty forgettable movie.",

That it's one of the classics and it is mentioned as one of the Jamie Lee Curtis scream queen classics. Ha ha please. I love Jamie Lee Curtis but never was she ever stalked in this film, thus not making her any kind of scream queen in this film.The points I liked in this movie: The creepy beginning, the old camera of this film (I love \"old\" horror movies, they have a more creepier atmosphere to them, I hate new cameras), the insanely creepy phone calls. The voice and whispers of the phone calls are just disturbing and also when he is killing victims he speaks with that voice. Then the rest of the movie tanked it...here's why.The movie dragged, there were no murders throughout the film. Everything was saved for the end, and when you reach the end you get hit with insane amounts of disco music. I personally do not like to see my murderers on screen. I prefer that they remain mysterious and anonymous till the very end. If your gonna show your killer please make him scary. This murderer was too skinny, dressed in black and just wearing a plain black mask with two holes in the eyes. Just stupid. I hated that. the decapitation was great but that final scene at the prom just reeked of Carrie. So everyone runs for the hills when they see the decapitated head, and the disco is STILL on and Jamie Lee, her boyfriend in this movie and the killer are fighting to disco music. That was that. The icing on this mess is the revelation that the killer is Jamie Lee's brother in the movie. In the flashback it just simply shows you that her brother witnessed the murder at the beginning sequence of the movie. Just lame. I was really expecting just a good solid horror movie but this just didn't do it for me.I gave this movie points for atmosphere and Jamie Lee Curtis. The rest of it is a bomb.",

            "content": "Four seniors who all share a terrible secret are stalked and bumped off by a mysterious vengeful killer during the night of the high school prom. Director Paul Lynch, working from an engrossing script by William Gray, relates the absorbing story at a steady pace, develops and sustains a sizable amount of suspense, and stages the murder set pieces with real flair and skill (a lengthy protracted chase sequence is especially tense, gripping, and exciting). Better still, there's a strong underlying theme about the painful loss of childhood innocence, the killer's identity is a real surprise, and the ending manages to be both moving and thrilling in equal measure. The sound acting from the capable cast helps matters a whole lot: Jamie Lee Curtis makes for an appealing lead as the sweet Kim, Anne-Marie Martin contributes a marvelously hateful performance as snippy and stuck-up bitch Wendy, underrated character actor Robert Silverman has a cool part as creepy janitor Sykes, plus there's praiseworthy work by Casey Stevens as Kim's affable and protective brother Nick, Pita Oliver as Kim's loyal gal pal Vicki, David Mucci as surly troublemaker Lou, Mary Beth Evans as sensitive virgin Kelly, and Joy Thompson as the bubbly Jude. Alas, Leslie Nielsen is wasted in a pretty insubstantial role as principal Mr. Hammond. Although decidedly light on heavy duty gore, there's still a pleasingly juicy decapitation by ax at the conclusion. The fantastic throbbing disco soundtrack hits the get-down groovy spot and the sequence with Jamie Lee busting some gnarly John Travolta-style moves on the dance floor is simply priceless. Robert C. News's slick cinematography provides a bright glittery look and makes neat use of a restless prowling camera. The shivery score by Paul Zaza and Carl Zittrer does the shuddery trick. A most worthwhile slice'n'dice opus.",

Then there's the issue of just what do slasher fans want from their movie of choice? Wall to wall kills with blood shed everywhere and without due care and attention of story substance? Or some character and story development building to the terror? Prom Night is the latter, if you prefer the former and you have not seen this then you really are advised to stay away as you will be asleep after an hour.Paul Lynch's movie works on its basic terms, where although it inevitably is a Halloween clone, the story build is of interest. The killer isn't hard to figure out, mind, so we are kind of in a situation where the last half hour holds few surprises, but back story is solid, red herrings nicely fried and there's a good quota of suspense as the stalk and slash arrives. Acting is of the usual standard for such fare, with Jamie Lee Curtis holding court, and Leslie Nielsen headlines but isn't in it much and does a cringe worthy dance scene that is horrifying in itself. 6/10",

Still, you get to see Jamie Lee Curtis during her horror making days and you get to see Leslie Nielson before every movie he did was a spoof. It is strange though how the sequels are completely different than this slasher movie with a bit of mystery and sadness in it. I think part two adds more of a supernatural twist to it and comedy as well.",

            "content": "This film is very very very slow for a slasher. It runs close to 90 minutes and for the first 2/3 of it i was almost falling asleep. Short synopsis avoiding spoilers: the film starts off with a group of children forcing another child to kill herself, putting in most basic terms. The film follows the investigation of the death and the people involved for the first 10 to 15 minutes or so. We eventually pick back up with the four teens involved and they are all seniors about to graduate. From there it follows them from day to day, until prom night comes... My personal thoughts on the film is it could have moved at a faster pace, I don't mind slower paced films but its only truly good in films building atmosphere and keeping the audience interested with strong characters. I think overall though it is a decent slasher and one of the better ones I just had major problems with the pacing and I found a few of the characters unlikable, nonetheless I would check it out just don't spend too much money on it, unlike me who got a rare dvd release of it.",

Most of the kills are draggy and mediocre. However, the ending for this slasher is surprisingly emotional. I would definitely say the opening and finale are the high points for this both predictable and unexpected flick.",

Yes, by 1980 disco as mainstream was pretty much dead, it \"sucked.\" But for anyone who has never lost their like for disco music and enjoys discovering the nostalgia of it all, Prom Night offers something interesting. For anyone who really knows disco (I know, scary thought...) you'll recognize the music as a blatant ripoff of Patrick Hernandez' \"Born to be Alive\" which was immensely popular by 1980. And also I think it's pretty creative to have the movie's disco love-theme titled, \"Love Me Till I Die\" playing during the final stalking/killing scene..I mean, come on, it's cheesy but so brilliant!

            "content": "Yes, this film is a blatant rip of Halloween.  First, and most obviously, is the \"holiday-gone-bad\" aspect.  The rest I realized as I watched this film immediately after \"Halloween\".  The film starts in the past, just as Halloween does.  Second, the presumed killer in Prom Night is hounded by a cop, just as Halloween's Meyers is hounded by his psychiatrist.  Third, the killer escapes from an asylum and drives a distinctive, stolen vehicle. Four the killer has been catatonic since the original incident and five, his car is seen in the background of a couple of scenes.  This film is different, however, as it does not want you to assume the escaped lunatic is the killer, and instead gives you about 15 choices.  This \"guess\" the killer is pretty well done, and doesn't resort to its psuedo-remakes trick of throwing an entirely new suspect in at the last moment. The rest of the film, aside from this one novelety is rather boring.  The whole set-up lacks suspense and direction.  The whole affair feels like a late 70's movie-of-the-week.  The film was obviously shot in Canada and suffers from a very 70s Canadian horror film look and feel.  All of the characters are quickly glossed over and stereotyped, probably due to the aforementioned gimmick of \"everyone-a-suspect\" which requires a lot of time. The film doesn't really get going until the last half hour, and then killing after killing is fit into the film. Unfortunately, its not even all that so-bad-its-funny; its mostly just mediocre.  There are a few scenes that will amuse: the whole \"Saturday Night Fever\" sequence; the fact that the Prom, and indeed the whole film has only one disco song in it, played over and over; the final murder sequence which is difficult to believe as its background is the aformentioned disco song; and the fact that half of these \"high school students\" look to be at least 28.  To be honest, I felt the orginal trailers included on the end of the tape I rented were better than the entire film.",

The very familiar storyline, that's become standard in most slasher films, of the movie has to do with a masked killer out on the loose hunting down, with his trusty ax, those responsible for the accidental death of 10 year-old Robin Hammond, Tammy Bourne, six years ago.Being released at the hight of the 1970's and early 80's disco craze the film \"Prom Night\" has one of the most annoying and brain numbing soundtracks that you'll ever experience in a movie! Together with lighting that's so bad that you'll end up seeing spots before your eyes when their, after the movie is finally over, exposed to sunlight!Even though we already know who was responsible for Robin's death before the opening credits were given this red herring scenario that she in fact was raped and murdered by a local sex offender Lenoard Mirch. This has the poor and confused Lenoard end up getting badly burned in a car smash-up when he tried to escape from the pursuing police. Convicted of murder and ruled insane Lenoard is sent off to a mental institution for the criminally insane in far off Cleveland. It just so happens the when the ax murders of high school students, at the Alexander Hamilton High School, begin Lenoard just happened to have escaped from his confinement and is the prime suspect in committing them. This gives the killer all the cover he needs to carry out his grizzly task with Lenoard not him, whoever he is, being held responsible for his crimes.***SPOILER***Even though it's very evident whom the masked killer is targeting, those responsible for Robin's death, he inexplicably ends up axing a number of students who weren't even on his hit list! The most prominent of them Lou Farmer, David Mucci, the school bully who gets his head lopped off which ends up dropping on the dance floor to the shock and horror of everyone, students teachers and parents, at the prom!There's nothing really special about the film which makes you wonder why almost thirty years after its release the movie has spawned a number of sequels and was even remade in 2008 for a new generation of slasher-movie fans? There's also in \"Prom Night\" actor Leslie Nielsen as Kim's father Raymond Hammond who happens to be the principle of the troubled Alexander Hamilton High School. Even though Nielson gets top billing, ahead of Jamie Lee Curtis, he's only in the movie for less then ten minutes! Seeing-from the script-in how bad the film \"Prom Night\" really is Nielsen probably realized that the less exposer he had the better it was- in people not remembering him being in the movie-for his future acting career!",

Actually, all of the actors did well. It's just that NOTHING HAPPENS FOR AN HOUR! We get treated to one of the LONGEST cheesy-ass disco dances on the school floor that I've ever seen. It did nothing for the film, other than show how \"hot\" Jamie can look while disco dancing.And the teens look like they're all in their late twenties, but I have to let that slide because most slasher films from this period have older-looking teens.There was ONE fairly effective shot regarding a beheading, but THAT WAS IT! It certainly wasn't a saving grace for this waste-of-time.If you REALLY are a fan of Jamie Lee Curtis, then I suppose I'd recommend this because she does a good job with a boring script.

Some will love that, some will hate it.Probably only watched these days as part of a Jamie Lee slasherthon. This time she's the disco dancing prom Queen (although clearly she's looking like she should have graduated college by now), but she's slasher royalty and still dodges the axe well enough.I'm sure this would be pretty forgotten if it wasn't for the casting of a scream queen, however it does have some unique and good elements to it, which I think still make it pretty watchable.Unlike a lot of slashers, it crudely explores the different mental health effects of the death of a child on a family and adds a particularly nasty flavour to its 'mean girl and boy' characters.It's definitely got the funkiest soundtrack to chop someone's head off to and a Wendy's firm cult favourite extensive chase scene. But even by 1980 we'd been here many times before and you can tell it's more going through the typical motions rather than trying to be to unique.It's not the best, it's not the worst. If you're a slasher fan, you'll probably watch it more than once, but after the first viewing it's gonna end up a 'background slasher', while you focus on your online shopping.Far more enjoyable after a bit of 420, then you can ponder was Leslie Nielsen always old, is the killer inspired by Spider-Man and is ironic that disco's popularity died around the same time as this was released?

The death was blamed on the local madman. Could it be revenge? More importantly, who is it?The storyline may seem unoriginal but this was the first slasher with this kind of plot. But the story was probably borrowed from Lois Duncans 1973 novel 'I Know What You Did Last Summer' which was later made into the movie of the same name (1997) based on the screenplay by Kevin Williamson, the writer of the Scream films (1996-2000). Speaking of Scream (1996), that film seems to have taken a page out of this classic...inspired?Despite the the unoriginal plot, Prom Night is really underrated. I mean, it's better than Friday the 13th (1979).Here are my points: Though they have very different story's, they are played out in a similar fashion. Also they have have similar structures. Both start with a murder(s).While the beginning of Friday the 13th ripped-off Halloween (1978), it was OK but not as good or effective as the opening in Prom Night. When the films move on into the middle section, both try to develop the characters. Prom Night succeeds with one character: Wendy, the for-some-reason likable school bitch played by Anne-Marie Martin better known as Eddie Benton-her stage name. She had everything-looks, personality & some killer lines. But Friday the 13th suffers by the fact that it can't produce any characters to care for. Instead, it creates a dumb girly-girl named Alice.Now the confrontation in Friday the 13th...WHOA! in the bad way...but there were all the classic death scenes which were effective NOT SUSPENSEFUL like Prom Night.How could the death scenes in Friday the 13th be suspenseful when you don't care for a single person? Prom Night, on the other hand, had some effective death scenes & Wendys death was really suspenseful & really inspiring towards the chase scenes in todays horror films such as I Know What You Did Last Summer (1997).So in my opinion, Prom Night farts on Friday the 13th big time but cannot top Halloween.Now back to Prom Night. It works real good. The flick tells the story, then develops the characters while making you laugh & creeping you out, then they knock off the characters in a strong manner. The use of clich\u00e9s & the bad quality in Prom Night really lowered the films standhards & makes the picture dated but i can easily ignore them.Entertaining it is. & kind of sad. & funny. & creepy. & more stuff yet the list would go onnnnn & onnnnn & onnnnn.More bonus points: The score was fabulous, the acting, very good & very convincing, look out for Jaimie Lee Curtis, Eddie Benton & Leslie Neilson.Another thing: Prom Night was one of the first horror movies to use the who dunnit formula. For me, who the killer turned out to be in this picture was a surprise......maybe i wasn't thinking hard enough.The gore: You get a girl falling from a window, some blood, a slashed throat, multiple stabs in throat, car crash, an Axe killing, a nice decapitation & some mild violence. Might sound good but most of it comes at the prom & most of it is offscreen. Still, the gore was good for 1979 but may seem dated nowadays. OK.3 out of 5 stars. A dated underrated slasher...you may not see it the way i do. If your someone who likes early 80's slasher films & doesn't mind soapies, than this is recommended...kinda hard to find a copy, but.PS: Prom Night & Terror Train (1979) are not Friday the 13th rip-offs-all three were filmed in 1979 & all three were released in 1980 so it is safe to say that they are not Friday the 13th rip-offs but Halloween inspired films. & even if i am wrong, that only improves Prom Night AND Terror Trains semi-cult-following due to the fact that they are better than Friday the 13th.Followed by a sequel, Prom Night II Hello Mary Lou (1987).

            "content": "Prom Night is one of the lesser \"classics\" of modern teen slasher films. It didn't go on to become an institution like Friday the 13th, Halloween or A Nightmare on Elm Street but it's remembered above scores of other forgettable flicks. I'm sure that's largely because of the presence of then-scream queen Jaime Lee Curtis, but I also suspect it's due to the movie's whodunit nature and the very human qualities of its mystery killer.While playing hide-and-go-seek in an abandoned school, 4 children accidentally kill a little girl. 6 years later, those children and the dead girl's brother and sister are getting ready for senior prom. But someone else is coming to the prom; someone looking for bloody revenge. But is it the escaped lunatic who got blamed for the little girl's death and was horrible disfigured in a fiery accident? Is it the high school's creepy groundskeeper? Is it the dead girl's disturbed mother? Is it her father, who's also principal of the high school? Or is it someone even more unexpected?In all honesty, many viewers will probably figure out who the killer is early on. Partly that's because we've all seen this same formula played out time and again. Partly that's because it actually is pretty obvious if you think about it. But the movie deserves credit for effectively building up both obvious and non-obvious red herrings to at least try and keep the audience guessing until the very end. That's more effort than most teen slasher flicks ever put forth.Unlike more fantastic villains like Jason Voorhees and Michael Myers, the killer in Prom Night is remarkable for being realistically unimpressive. The killer isn't super strong or unkillable or defying the laws of physics to always be ahead of the victims no matter where they go. This is a killer who falls down and can be outsmarted and isn't all seeing and all knowing. The Prom Night murderer isn't some monster from the dark. It's just somebody dressed all in black with an ax, and there's something about the mundane nature of that which gives a bit of depth to it all. Because the killer is a real person, it makes the victims real people and not just prey you're waiting to see slaughtered.This movie also has the awful clothing of that moment right when the 70s shifted into the 80s and the even more atrocious hairstyles that went along with them. It's also painfully obvious why Jaime Lee Curtis was the only young performer in the cast who went on to have a hugely successful career. Prom Night isn't one of those films where you can see the best young actors of the generation all starting out together. It's basically Jamie Lee and a bunch of people who spent the rest of their careers trying to get bit parts in McDonald's commercials.For you teen horror aficionados, there is one scene of brutality in this film that must have been mind blowing in its day and has held up well over the decades. The rest of the violence in pretty tame and there's no nudity that's worth speaking of.One of the most interesting things about Prom Night is that its hero and heroine are the most popular kids in high school and they're also nice people. It's weird to see because in the decades after this it seems like the class misfits grew up, took over Hollywood and began making films where the popular kids in school were either the killers or the first victims and it was the outcast, unpopular students who would save the day.There's no denying that Prom Night is dated. It's still tolerable, though, which is saying a lot for a 30 year old teen slasher flick.",

            "content": "As a slasher this movie really fall short. The movie kept me constantly waiting for something that just never happened. The movie feels like one big build-up to nothing.It will really be the horror-fans that will be most disappointed and displeased with this movie. There are not enough killings or other defining genre moments in it and besides when the killings do occur it feels very sloppy and the blood and gore is disappointing. In my opinion the killer seems more like a slapstick character at times.The movie makes some wrong and uninteresting choices with its build-up. The character development just feels uninteresting and also unnecessary. What you want from a slasher are some killings and preferably some gore and creativity to go along with it all. This movie just keeps building up and developing. It plays on the idea of presenting as many different character in this movie as possible, who potentially could turn out to be the killer. Of course nothing wrong with this idea and it gets used quite a lot but when nothing is happening you just couldn't care any less for who will turn out to be the killer. The movie just never gets tense or scary. Think you can blame inexperienced director Paul Lynch for just not handling the genre very well. It's an early '80's movie, that in its style foremost still feels like an '70's flick. It uses some fancy editing and there were some nice moments in it, which kept the movie going. The movie unfortunately also prominently features some disco music and some disco moves from all of the cast members. The kind of moves that are just too embarrassing to look at now days.The story also feels quite messy, aside from the fact that it just isn't a very interesting or even remotely original one. Lots of the characters just feel very random and only seem to be put in the movie to serve as potentially suspects for the killer role. I just don't get it for instance what the roles of the cops are in this movie. They are lurking around everywhere all the time but doing nothing at all.But well, it still has scream-queen Jamie Lee Curtis in it, so how bad can it actually be, you might think. It really is an irrelevant fact that Jamie Lee Curtis is in this though. She gets nothing interesting to do. Same goes for Leslie Nielsen and all of the other actors in it. Nielsen probably still gives the best performance out of the entire movie and it made me wish he was more in it. It made me wish as well that he made less comedies and played more serious roles throughout his career. A disappointing and just mainly very uninteresting slasher.5/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/",

Dimly lit, badly executed slasher film wastes the talents of Nielsen and Curtis (who combined have 10 minutes of screen time, if that) and also wastes a pretty good slasher idea: killer stalks prom goers. Contains elements of both SCREAM and I KNOW WHAT YOU DID LAST SUMMER (i.e. the killer calling his/her victims, friends vowing never to reveal deadly secret) so we know where Kevin Williamson got his ideas from. But the film is very hard to watch due to the poor lighting and there aren't any murders for the first hour or so, making it hard to appeal to any tastes. Fans of Curtis and Nielsen might want to check it out. FYI: the killer's identity is so blatantly obvious from the opening scene, it should come as no surprise even to new slasher fans.

Intentionally or not (I believe the latter) the film does build up a certain amount of mood in the opening 50 minutes or so, with the introduction of the would-be victims. This flick drags on forever without anything really happening in that time, but somehow it goes by pretty nicely. Solid performances by Curtis and Leslie Nielsen could explain part of that.The execution of the all-important final third (i.e. the killings) is awfully poor. The kills are unimaginative, poorly timed and paced and very clumsily done. I did like the fact that the killer here fumbled a bit in trying to off the characters (after all; not everyone has the super powers of Michael Myers or Jason Vorhees) but editing here and lazy direction kill the suspense.Spoilers: Also, the red herrings! Talk about cheaply done. Throwing in an employee on the school grounds who's mysteriously present at odd moments and always gives the girls a sinister look and there's no payoff with the dude. He's just there to look suspicious.The maniac who escapes from a mental asylum and nothing happens with that dude either. Every viewer over the age of twelve knows he's not responsible for what's about to happen. And we're not even rewarded with an extra kill scene or something. This is cheap.And what happened to Leslie Nielsen and his wife? Did the ground eat them up? They just disappear and don't even show up for the dramatic finale! I agree with a reviewer who stated this fact and said only \"lazy film-making\".End of spoiler.Prom Night squanders it's potential in a big way. Now, I love good slashers and this film gets high marks for having Jamie Lee Curtis in it and Leslie Nielsen but I think 4 is being quite generous.Although I found it a novelty to have the big showdown in the end accompanied by cheesy disco music. I didn't look half-bad.Overall; Prom Night is disappointing.",

But there's some nice atmosphere and a look the movie has about it that I appreciate. The cast is good, headlined by scream queen Jamie Lee Curtis and Leslie Nielsen. Future soap actress Anne-Marie Martin makes for a great mean girl. Her part of the film is obviously ripped off from Carrie but nobody said this was high art! There are some dated trappings such as the disco prom but I actually think this adds to the movie's appeal. I've never understood the critique some have of movies that they are supposed to look like they take place today or else they are flawed. That's pretty dumb, in my opinion.

Yet, although it was certainly popular when it first came out, it seems to have lost its vitality since then.

Leslie Nielsen plays the principal of the school and father of the girl who died.\"Prom Night\" (1980) combines elements of \"Carrie\" (1976), \"Halloween\" (1978) and \"Saturday Night Fever\" (1977). It contains the prom set-up & conniving students of the first one, the slasher killer & Jamie Lee Curtis of the second and the disco dancing of the third. The emphasis of a group of teens in high school is reminiscent of the later \"Christine\" (1983). The movie debuted 2.5 months after \"Friday the 13th\" and less than 21 months after \"Halloween.\"While it's the least of these as far as polished filmmaking goes, it's not far off and scores better on the female front than all of them except \"Friday the 13th.\" It's basically a coming-of-age flick focusing on high school in the Great Lakes region with the threat of a masked assailant. There are no less than four possible suspects and I was unable to guess the slayer.The film runs 1 hour, 32 minutes and was shot in the Toronto area (Richmond Hill, St. James Cemetery, Scarborough Bluffs and Don Mills Collegiate Institute).GRADE: B-",

But, the reason why I like the bad ones is because they're usually fun ie. \"Urban Legends 2\" or \"Halloween Ressurrection\" and they usually have a nice body count and some thrills. \"Prom Night\" was very disappointing because it was bad and it wasn't even fun. In fact I don't think that I would call it a slasher as there is only about 4 or 5 deaths! Some might defend it by saying it's old. Well, \"The Texas Chainsaw Massacre\" and \"Halloween\" came out way before this. So it has no excuse.What was wrong with it then? Well, it wasn't so much that the first death doesn't occur until the last half hour although that was quite annoying. It just seemed like it was taking some aspects from \"Carrie\". The biggest similarities being that the final sequence is set at a prom and that woman and her hired goon look and act exactly like John Travolta and his girlfriend. However, \"Carrie\" works because it's not a slasher. I don't believe in a slow-burner slasher and even if this was meant to be one, the pay-off wasn't worth waiting around for an hour.It was annoying that most of the deaths, bar one, were off-screen so we couldn't see them! Honestly, the gore was the only thing that had going for this film and it decided to get rid of that. There was also only one chase scene, making the other deaths have zero suspense. The chase scene was also really poorly done, I shot a better short horror film when I was about 14 called \"Caddy Killer\" which was just a laugh and it resembled that chase scene with the long shots of people running, it was pathetic.The whole film was actually really poorly directed. It definitely says \"Paul Lynch\" not David! The lighting was all over the place, with some shots being really over-exposed and others being far too dark to see anything. I did like the idea of a \"I Know What You Did Last Summer\" set-up but its potential was unfortunately ruined by the poor tenseless writing and zero-suspense directing. The writing also was unnecessarily sexist, giving excuses for the women to go around wearing hardly anything or maybe just a bra because they're in the changing room.I don't particularly understand why Leslie Neilson was in this either. He didn't have a very big part and it wasn't a funny part either (the script carries virtually no wit at all). Jamie Lee was also far too good for this, her dancing was funny though, giving John Travolta a run for his money! The cast was far too old though to play they're parts, we're meant to believe these people are around 16? They were about 10 and then it says 6 years later. Some of them looked in there late 20's! \"Prom Night\" has very little going for it. It's pacing is slow, it's writing and directing poor and it's death scenes unimaginative and kept to a minimum. It also carries a very unsurprising ending in which we're meant to gasp in shock. There's actually a TV movie that's a big like this called \"My Super Psycho Sweet Sixteen\" and that's still better than this. Keep clear slasher fans, you aren't missing much here.",

Another problem is that the slasher does not start up after an hour and even when he starts not all the killers are ever seen.

And anyone who watches the film will see how it's paced will agree. The plot is well done though as the theme of revenge is well carried out, despite the fact that the film is not that scary. You have four high school students who have been hiding the truth of what happened to a ten year old named Robin Hammond for six long years. Only to have someone see what they did and he is preparing for revenge by stalking them as a masked and hooded axe wielding predator. And this all leads up to the high school's prom night and one by one the blood drips and heads roll! Overall it's a decent horror flick that's really just straight to the point and revenge themed while like many other 80's horror flicks it centered around teens, hormones, skin and blood. A treat worth noticing though is the work of scream queen Jamie Lee Curtis who was still very young at the time and Leslie Nielsen is likable as her father here in an uncommon role for him.",

            "content": "I feel obliged to not rate a film too low if disco music is a prominent feature of it, especially when said groovy tunes seem incongruent to the rest of the schlock on screen. Such is the case with \"Prom Night,\" a slasher flick conspicuously in imitation of \"Halloween\" (1978), which also starred Jamie Lee Curtis, a police manhunt and a masked madman cutting up sexually-promiscuous teenagers. This one also has an \"I Know What You Did Last Summer\" sort of vibe to the plot--and that was a book, apparently, before it was a movie, so don't get any ideas about \"Prom Night\" having originality--but that's not important. Although the filmmakers entirely blunder the reflexive voyeurism that was central to the success of \"Halloween,\" they, at least, understood that they needed a good soundtrack to match the pastiche. Counterintuitive to creating tension for a horror film, however, they chose disco.The base appeal of the horror genre is in the physical reactions it induces in the audience. The jump scare and how when successful it startles the viewer, for instance. \"Prom Night\" creates a physical reaction, too, but it's of a toe-tapping and body-swaying variety in rhythm to Paul Zaza and Carl Zittrer's score. It's fitting, I suppose, too, that as the film overall rips off \"Halloween,\" the production was sued for its copying popular tracks that the budget couldn't afford to license. Oh well, at least, Curtis is a surprisingly good dancer, and we even get to see her cutting it up on the dance floor with an awkward Leslie Nielsen, playing her father in one of his last straight roles.",

It's not surprising horror icon, is in this. Prom Night is a typical revenge horror, with some nice bloody parts, some of them, in bad taste. In this one, we so want to know who the killer is, knocking off a score of hormone raging teens, involved in a nasty bullying prank, which resulted in a fatal accident. What's messy, is the camera work, having to be used heavily, clumsily, to make bits more suspenseful. Leslie 'Naked Gun' Nielsen's existence in this, is almost non existent, and again Jamie Lee, puts in a good performance. What quite disturbed me, in the opening peace, straight after that poor girl fell, was the cold reactions of her kid taunters, where sincerely, later on, I was glad, they got their just desserts. The teen characters in this one, are quite unlikeable infact. This slasher, just came up short with me. Passable, but not without interest. Sad, judging by the finale, the moment between Curtis and killer, quite touching and unforgettable. Just take that, and the grand start from the rest of the movie. Blood, aka paint. Looks so fake now. Director Lynch, has dome better, with Bullies, and his push boundry, sex thriller, Cross Country, a prime example.4.5/10.",

I really like that, as straightforward and denotative the film is( as most slashers are) Prom night still manages to conote certain feelings and it can do that precisely because it doesn't try to create tension too soon. I may be alone in this but the rushed climax to me felt like a quality simply because watching the characters dance is funner than watching them run through dark barely visible hallways just to five minute later see them killed in a most likely improbable and overly dramatic way.\nAnother great quality this film has going for it is the way the first death scene is filmed, it shows so little but still creates such tension and i think it works way better than some of the more gore oriented death scenes of the film because the way i see it is not the blood nor the death that makes the scenes appealing but the stylization of the film making, the representation of horror, not the denotation of objects of horror.\nBesides all of that the film is not really that good, we have the usual actors and actresses that look 30 playing parts of kids in their 17's and not doing that much of a good job. The motif of the killer is acceptable but in no means interesting or a highlight in the film. The dialogues are kind of dull and so are the characterization of the kids in the film. The film also looks quite ugly, everything is shiny and really bright and the final scene is barely watchable due to its incessant flashing.",

Yeah, we know that these are the films that set up the clich\u00e9s, but this still doesn't go any way to reducing the feeling of\u0085well, having seen it all before\u0085and \"Prom Night\", released in 1980, is no exception. All of the main tropes are in force here: the horrendous secret kept for many years, the anniversary of said horrendous event, menacing phone calls (not as menacing as those in that seminal slasher flick \"Black Christmas\" though), and of course the butchering of sexually active teens who also use soft drugs. However, even given the predictable nature of the slasher genre, the joy of a good slasher has always been what can be done within such rigid criteria and \"Prom Night\" certainly makes an admirable effort by avoiding the \"Halloween\" style killer-that-can't-be-stopped motif or a \"Black Christmas\" style killer-we-never-see either but instead opts for (ultimately) humanising the killer which lends a degree of genuine pathos when the killer is revealed. Saying this, it definitely could have been a better film as the pace is slow from taking a long time to get going and a lot of scenes (the funky prom dancing) go on longer than they should. Overall, \"Prom Night\" is a watchable (if slightly boring in parts) slasher-flick which is better than many other films in the genre but nowhere near as good as it could have been.",

            "review_title": "Mixed bag",
            "content": "On a Halloween month horror movie binge, I re-visited PROM NIGHT (1980), which is another film I recall from my youth. I literally only saw the movie once when I was a kid, but remember the major details of the plot and who the killer was. But I couldn't remember if the movie was actually good. On re-watch, I have to say it's probably in the mediocre category for 80s slasher films. The film starts out in an abandoned warehouse with 4 pre-teen kids playing a prank on a girl who is about a year or so younger. During the prank, the girl falls out an upper story window to her death and the 4 culprits (a boy and 3 girls) vow to keep silent about their part in her death. Flashforward 6 years to the film's main timeline in 1980. The dead girl was the middle child of a local prominent family, led by the Dad who is also the high school principal (played by Leslie Nielsen, who would go onto fame in such comedy spoof films as The Naked Gun and it's sequels), the Mom (veteran German actress Antoinette Bower who was in a ton of old classic TV back in the day), the oldest child and film's protagonist Kimberly (played by horror icon Jamie Lee Curtis), and the youngest child Alex (played by Michael Tough). Kim is a senior and Alex a sophomore at the high school where their Dad is the principal. Kim is the most popular girl in school and prom queen. Her boyfriend Nick is prom king. Unbeknownst to Kim, Nick is the boy who was part of the prank 6 years earlier that resulted in her little sister's death. Also 2 of her 3 best friends were also part of the prank. The 3rd girl who was the de facto leader of the quartet is Wendy (played by Anne-Marie Martin, who would go onto co-star in the late 80s cult comedy TV classic Sledgehammer as the titular character's partner). Wendy is the school's cliche mean girl as well as being Nick's ex and thus Kim's sworn enemy. The plot of the film involves a mysterious figure stalking and terrorizing the teen quartet for their roles in the death of Kim's sister, culminating in the final showdowns on, you guessed it...Prom Night! The film plays on the slasher trope of sex-crazy teens who smoke and drink and cause trouble getting their comeuppance. The 3 girls involved in the prank all fall into the \"slutty\" category as 2 of them are shown having sex and paying the price, while the 3rd one Wendy is guilty because she's the mean girl. Kim is doubly sympathetic because she's the innocent heroine whose sister was wrongfully killed.Although this film stars a couple of big names in Nielsen and Curtis, Prom Night is not really a standout of the genre. Curtis was at the height of her scream queen fame having starred in Halloween, The Fog, and Terror Train, the latter two of which came out the same year as this movie. It seems like a lot, but in The Fog, she had more of a minor part and was part of an ensemble and even in this film as she's the nominal protagonist, the story focuses on her clique of high school friends and enemies as much as it does her. Terror Train was the one where she got to really stretch her acting chops. In this movie, I felt like the writing did very little to challenge Nielsen and Curtis. Nielsen was actually top-billed, but literally had only a handful of scenes where he got to play Dad/principal with about a minute of screentime in each scene. Bower had like 2 or 3 scenes of her character looking sad. It was also distracting how mature these \"high schoolers\" felt. I know that it's standard to cast older actors to play these parts for several reasons, but many times the writing and acting can sell the characters feeling younger. Here, I felt like I was watching adults play teenagers. Another issue with Prom Night is how heavily it \"borrows\" from other more iconic, popular films such. First, there's Halloween, where this movie has a subplot of an escaped killer from an asylum (Michael Myers) and having a psycho-analysis scene as well as being hunted down by the cop who arrested him a few years earlier, with the doc and the cop being Prom Night's fusion of Dr. Loomis. Of course, Curtis herself was the protagonist of Halloween and I'm sure the filmmakers tried to capitalize on this factoid. Then there's Saturday Night Fever where there's an extended disco dance sequence at the prom of Curtis' character and her boyfriend (the prom queen and king) doing their best John Travolta impressions. Also, a bit of destiny as Curtis would go onto co-star with Travolta 5 years later in the film Perfect. Finally, there's the Carrie subplot, as Martin's mean girl character schemes with her brutish, bully boyfriend (another Travolta reference as he played this character in Carrie) to ruin the prom for Curtis and embarrass her in front of the entire school. Outside of the obvious copying from other films, this movie has a strange \"TV movie of the week\" vibe as it is shot and edited rather poorly and just jumps from scene to scene. But the best part of Prom Night, and thus the 5 stars, are actually the kills. Each one was unique and longer than the one before. There's an authenticity to the blood and gore in 80s slashers that a lot of modern horror movies lack. And because this isn't one of the more iconic ones like Halloween or Friday the 13th or Nightmare on Elm Street, the killer here is actually vulnerable, struggles, and can get hurt. Having re-watched both Prom Night and Terror Train within the same week really gave me perspective as to why Terror Train is a much better film. It has better writing, acting, pacing and real tension, while Prom Night just kind of wastes a lot of time until the big kill scenes. Worth watching for the slashing but not much else.",

When it comes to a slasher, I'm waiting for the ultimate chase scene, and this film gives you an absolutely long, creepy chase scene.\ud83d\udc4eThings I didn't liked in the film*Jaimie Lee Curtis's character is kinda unnecessary. Not kinda. A lot actually! They cast her, probably because they wanted to promote more the film, but I can tell for sure that she doesn't drive the plot. It's like they wrote the script and then they altered it because they decided to put her into the film.*The killer made weird sounds throughout the film, which was something between creepy and ridiculous.*In the end it has very dramatic tone, which keeps me divided. I'm not sure that this is a flaw, but I'm just saying.*They pursue Jaimie Lee Curris and Leslie Nielsen as the protagonists of the film, something false, especially Leslie Nielsen's character is definitely a cameo role. The reason is obvious. These two actors are the most popular in this film, so they wanted their film to succeed. A familiar producer's strategy.*Conclusion*This film, in my opinion, is below of mediocre for the aforementioned reasons. I don't know if I would recommend it, but definitely it's a classic that had something tragic and dramatic in it. It has been influenced by previous slashers, but it became influence for a later ones also.",

The film is filled with the usual simple plot for these slasher 70-80's films, about teen drama and grizzly murder, which happens to take place during Prom Night in this flick. The movie runs smoothly with its talented cast and wonderful lead, Jamie Lee Curtis, along with a basic storyline that keeps you entertained. The film is a little lacking in the creativity of the killings and perhaps the ending should have been written differently. It's hard to have a great slasher film when the killer is a normal sweet guy that's just hurting inside from the loss of his sister.",

There are several genuinely frightening moments involving the female characters when they are alone in the school after classes have ended with a mentally impaired janitor who may or may not be the killer (I first saw this film when I was still in high school myself and never felt entirely comfortable in it after hours again) The movie is also suspenseful enough so that we remain uncertain about the identity of the murderer until the very end (the clues are there, however, for the careful viewer).As is often the case with this sort of film, most of the teenaged characters look old enough to be playing the teachers. However, the cast is for the most part competent, with Jamie Lee Curtis standing out as the spunky decent heroine who ends the mayhem, although the would be lounge lizard Slick and the obnoxious but somehow hilarious Lou\u0097look out for his yearbook picture\u0097almost steal the film. \"Prom Night\" is no masterpiece, but some genuine shocks and wonderfully schlocky disco dance routines make this an enjoyable 90 minutes worth of viewing.",

Even as it's near graduation time in schools and colleges around now.I don't know whether it's some coincidence as this movie is like an early version of the 1997 movie \"I Know What You Did Last Summer\" with the big difference is the victim at the start, a girl named Robin, dies and someone knows or witnessed the group responsible and targets them for avenging the victim's death.This movie stars Jamie Lee Curtis as deceased girl's older sister, Kim, just two years after her role as Laurie Strode in John Carpenter's Halloween and she looks beautiful in her younger teen self.The killer is this movie isn't at all scary: he's dressed in black and wears a balaclava for a mask. And the way he runs and moves like a ninja. Bit an interesting whodunit mystery and the killer's identity a bit obvious before the reveal, yet I guessed correctly.The kills are not all good: one of the mean girls, Wendy, gets hacked with axe, while the screen cuts to black. The blood looks fake like shiny red paint, and the van explosion into fireball after going over a cliff.Best kill is the one of them was a decapitation in a moment of mistaken identity, where school bully was killed had been mistaken for Jamie Lee Curtis character's boyfriend, Nick, as Prom King.Overall, not a great movie, seems better than the 2008 remake which I've watched more times than this.",

Leslie Nelson and Jamie Lee Curtis it up from the b movie reputation of bad acting into a respectable affair despite a few cheesy moments. The kills aren't going to please gore hounds looking for a blood bath, but they are creative and different from the standard knife cut or ax to the back common in many others. A few highlights are Slick's can plunging off a cliff, Wendy's Chase scene through the school and Lou's decapitation which keep you on the edge of your seat. The atmosphere is genuinely creepy, dark and feels like a storm is on the horizon.The ending is abrupt since Jamie doesn't experience a true showdown in the style of Halloween, but since the reveal is a conflict of interest it does open up a new later on if Alex was trying to kill his sister or keep her out of harm's way. Alex dying in her arms before the credits roll feel like it was missing the finale gotcha moment almost feeling like a Greek tragedy. My only complaint is Mr. Hammond disappears half way through and it was due to budget cuts yet a line or two could've cleared it up.

If you're looking to laugh get a few scares here and there this Halloween season then Prom Night should definitely be on your list.Prom Night came out a time when slasher films were all the rage in the 80's. After the success of Halloween there were a string of imitators with Friday the 13th becoming wildly popular. If anything, Friday the 13th showed filmmakers that slasher films didn't have to be smart. They could be merely entertaining throwaway flicks that make a quick buck but lack artistic integrity. So after Friday the 13th the slasher movie machine began pumping out flick after flick of slasher mediocrity and this is definitely one of them. The only thing truly significant is that they some how got Leslie Nielson to star in this and Jamie Lee Curtis would further solidify herself as the scream queen of the late 70's and early 80's.The plot has classic slasher movie conventions written all over it. A girl plummets to her death while fleeing from the taunts of four vicious classmates. Years then pass and now it's prom night for the children that survived the incident. Soon someone begins taking vengeance against them for their childhood sin but whoever can it be?!? My biggest problem with Prom Night is that it has the potential to be something pretty good. The plot could be quite effective but you can tell the fillmmakers had no intention of making this at all memorable, at least not for the right reasons. The film has developed a bit of a cult following on video and DVD but not because it's scary or, even good. The following is based on how incredibly flawed the movie is and lets not forget the insanely funny disco soundtrack. If anything Prom Night represents a time in the 80's where slasher films portrayed all their characters as stupid cardboard cutouts who are just featured to be killed in horrific ways. I own the film and I know I'm panning but as a fan of the slasher genre it is a rather entertaining movie watch and make fun of with friends. Sometimes slasher films exist for that purpose alone.None of the acting is worth mentioning. Not even Jamie Lee Curtis is good here and you can tell this was her trying to wide the success she had with Halloween. Of all the horror films she appeared in after Halloween, this is certainly her at her weakest. The rest of the cast consist of unknowns who haven't seemed to have gotten much work lately. I wonder why? Then there is the ski mask killer of the piece who is a rather weak and unimpressive presence in the film. The creepy phone call thing works the first few times then it just gets stale and while he is effective during a chase scene towards the end of the film, the scene isn't quite long enough to really register. He also takes a bit too long to make an appearance. The film is practically almost over before he makes his first full appearance.If you want to have a cheesy horror movie night with friends for Halloween then Prom Night should be on your list. It's completely mediocre but at 94 minutes it could provide you with some big laughs and a few cheap scares. Plus there is a disco dance off in it, you at least need to witness THAT moment!",

Thank goodness movie making has come a long way since then and that it's not the era of disco or those horrible hairstyles anymore. That has got to be the most unattractive look in history.So the premise of this film is a young girl is accidentally killed during a game of hide and seek in an abandoned building by some mean kids who make a pact to never tell anyone for fear they'll go to jail. After the kids take off and leave the little girl on the ground - the camera pans over a pair of shoes standing over her lifeless body but it doesn't pan up to show us who it is. Cut to 6 years later and we see Mom, Dad, Sister & Brother standing over her grave paying their respects. Everyone is emotional but the mom still seems to be an emotional wreck. Next we see the killer (not his face just his hand dialing the phone and his shadow against the wall) making phone calls to all the kids who were at the abandoned building the day the little girl was killed. He makes his voice sound creepy and asks various questions to each one like \"Do you like to play games?\" etc...They all blow it off thinking it's a prank. Next we see the sister and brother and their friends at high school preparing for the prom that is to take place that night. And then it's all a bunch of filler until\nthe killer takes them down one by one at the prom. It was so bad it was good. A few highlights:The disco dance scene went on forever and the boyfriend looked so ridiculous dancing. I was cringing the whole time and rolling my eyes.The best part of the film was when the killer jumped up super dramatically before he came down and slashed the one girl's neck in the back of the van. I was like \"Who does that?! Why did they direct him to do that?\" So ridiculous! And then he's hopping and jumping all over the van wrestling with the overweight prom date of the girl whose neck he just slashed. The van is spinning and out of control forever before it goes off the cliff. I was laughing so hard. That whole scene was ridic! I mean the killer was so obvious hiding in the bushes those kids must have gone temporarily blind not to have seen him!The detective's acting was so over the top. His eyes were huge and they looked like they were gonna bulge right out of his head the way he was opening them so wide. Did he think that would make him seem more dramatic?The boyfriend of Jamie Lee Curtis was such a bad actor that I was mad he got spared in the end. He was one of the meanest in the group towards the little girl during the hide and seek game at the beginning of the film and yet the killer offs the one girl who wasn't as mean and very reluctant not to tell someone instead of that bratty boy.The Lou character was straight up gross! He overacted so badly. Is anyone surprised his film career didn't last? Not me.The brother's horrible acting at the end when he's dying was so laughable I'm surprised Jamie Lee Curtis was able to keep a straight face during that scene. And why was he wearing lipstick and blush? Was that intentional like he was trying to be his twin sister for that night or did the makeup department have a heavy hand that particular day?And lastly am I the only one who thought that these actors were way to old to play high schoolers. Especially the Wendy character. She looked like a 3 pack a day smoker with those bags you could pack luggage in under her eyes yet she's playing a senior in high school? Were they hard up for actors during the casting? She looked like a 70's streetwalker who had been divorced with two kids several years ago. And the lame attempt at making her look younger by putting her hair in a side ponytail just backfired. If anything it made her look older and like she was playing dress up.Jamie Lee Curtis is a good actress but I've always felt that she looked slightly mannish and her head shape is so narrow and small. It almost looks like it's fused on her neck so she can't turn her head properly. She looks like a mannequin. It's distracting.Did anyone else think that Mary Beth Ruben looked just like a young Kelly LeBrock? I thought it was her the whole time. I was shocked when I saw it wasn't.I would say watch it to see how bad movies were back in the 80's or for the nostalgia but you cannot take it seriously at all. This is one prom you don't want to take a date to or even yourself for that matter.",

However in the second half, there are a lot of nice colour palettes and some good mood lighting. I particularly like the colour scheme in the prom scene. Also, the editing in the final act is very impressive!The soundtrack is the best part of the film by far, and is extremely fun and recognisable. The score itself is ok and everything you would expect from an 80s slasher film, and the sound design is a lot better in the second half.The characters are mainly all very shallow, and unfortunately are not well written. The dialogue is nothing special either and feels a little dull in places. However, Jamie Lee Curtis does a good job and is always a joy to watch.The movie takes a long time to get into, and is surprisingly very slow paced resulting in it dragging a bit.

It is a period piece, capturing that '80s look. Jamie Lee was cute.  The disco music was funny, especially when a stone-faced Jamie tells her boyfriend \"Let's show them what we can do\" before they flaunt their cool dance moves.   My favorite part, as one other reviewer noted, is a scene where a cop at a desk thinks \"I gotta get that ba**ard before he butchers more people\". The voice-over is done with all the emotion of somebody saying \"I gotta remember to get some milk at the grocery store\". It is so awkward. I busted out laughing at that scene. Because of that one line, I did not regret seeing Prom Night.   In short, I probably only find value in 10 or 15 minutes of this entire film.

It follows the standard mad slasher formula: something bad happens in the past and years later, on the anniversary of the crime, a killer takes revenge. And like most others in the genre it takes place on a special occasion in this case the high school prom.\tThe tragedy in this film is the death of a young girl as her peers are teasing her. Each one of the kids involved in her death vows never to tell anyone, but of course, somebody witnessed it and plans to get even with them. So, SIX YEARS LATER, on the day of the prom, the masked killer goes into action. He starts by calling all of the kids to warn them and they are required by the plot to pass it off as a crank call. Later, he cuts out their yearbook pictures and places them in each of their respective lockers with malicious implications. Again, they don't take note of the warning. And by the time the prom begins, they have all but forgotten their threats (they all must have ADD). The movie tries to be a mystery setting up possible suspects such as the weird greens keeper or a horribly burned mental patient, but even those with the lowest IQ can figure out who the killer is.\tSince none of the victims seem to have any remorse about what they did or have any interesting personality corks, it is hard to develop any sympathy for them. They all have the old clich\u00e9d teenager problems such as getting a date, competing for attention, and not giving in to their desires. And when there in danger they act so stupidly that they almost deserve to die. For example, the masked assailant is chasing a girl and first she locks herself in a car, miraculously, she manages to escape, only to hide in a storage closet. At least the murders are done with a minimal amount of blood and gore.The star of the film, Jamie Lee Curtis, isn't even involved with the revenge plot and only is in danger at the very end of the movie because the killer targets her boyfriend. Oddly enough her scenes are almost unconnected to the rest of the movie. The best scene in the film has to be when she and her boyfriend do a cheesy spot light dance. And people wonder why disco went out of style. The film also stars Leslie Nielson, who got top billing, but disappears half way through the picture.

Firstly it is one of many copycat slashers that flooded the market after the success of Halloween (1978) and it feels like a rushed enterprise to cash in. Secondly the presence of Jamie Lee Curtis and Leslie Nielsen can't lift this one beyond being predictable and dull. In one of his last straight roles before he became better known for comedy starting with Airplane released the same year, Nielsen is given very little to do and despite top billing is hardly on screen.Despite a promising start and good premise it is badly written with uninspired direction. When a group of children bully a little girl to cause her death we fast forward several years to the same children, now grown up as teenagers preparing for their prom, who fall victim to a masked killer who is on the loose to wreak revenge on those responsible for what happened 6 years earlier.The film has it's moments, especially in the last 20 mins or so, but overall it lacks suspense, kills and gore. Jamie Lee Curtis is mostly disco dancing her way through to an inane soundtrack, as the film also tries to cash in on the recent success of Saturday Night Fever (1977), and most of the other characters are not very likeable or interesting. Poor lighting and overly grainy shots only emphasise it's low budget ineptitude so not quite sure how this managed to spawn three sequels.If you want to see a good suspenseful horror movie about a prom see Brian de Palma's Carrie (1976) instead.",

I've seen so many in my life I'm starting to work my way into the B-level and forgotten horror movies. In my opinion, this one can stay forgotten. First, a bit of context. 1974's Texas Chainsaw Massacre and 1978's Halloween changed horror. Gone was the horror of Rosemarys Baby, The Omen and The Exorcsist. Now, it's about teenagers running around naked and getting chopped to bits. Slashers, when done right, can be a blast. A menacing killer, sometimes shrouded in mystery. Friday the 13th if the same year did this well, feeling like a Hitchcock or Argento Murder mystery. A memorable weapon is a plus, a la Nightmare on Elm Street. Good chases, or suspense are a must, as In Halloween. And then you have the t&a that permeates the slasher genre. The problem with this one, for me, is that it came too early to understand what makes a good slasher. The Killer is not interesting or supernatural, the weapon is forgettable. Scenes that could be seen as exploitation are boring. The acting, even from Curtis, is passable at best. Granted Acting isn't a high point in slashers, but blood guts and breasts tend to distract horror audiences enough. This didn't. The camera work, never a high point of slashes, is especially bad, with day time shooting seeming overexposed. The sound is an issue too. I shouldn't have to make myself deaf to hear the dialogue. The biggest problem for me is the pacing. The killing takes too long to happen, and the mystery that is supposed to hook you doesn't stick. Skip this. Want a good slasher? Watch Halloween, Friday the 13th, Texas Chainsaw Massacre, A Nightmare in Elm Street. This is not original or interesting enough to warrant sitting through.",

Here's why I didn't like Prom NIght as much as I could've: Well the story was really interesting and I liked it a lot. Some killer getting revenge on students at their Prom Night for unknown reasons was definitely a perfect story, but what my problem with it was when the film dragged on for too long, the film's story was at a faint and it didn't feel like the story I had known.There was too much waiting going on and it dragged on for far too long. Trust me, I love slow, 80's slasher films like \"Halloween II\" and \"The Burning\" but there wasn't as much happening here as I had hoped, so it was lost in that perspective. Even if I liked some additional scenes, it felt like it was carrying a heavy boulder.That's my huge down falls of this film but I did not hate it at all, I just thought it could've been more. Here are the aspects of this average slasher which I believe work decently.The unknown killer killing for mostly unknown reasons were done really well. The killings were very fast paced and were effective. The music was daunting, creepy and very 80's style. Even the disco like music made this have a creepy edge. I also think the director's casting was well done. Leslie Nelson and Jamie Lee Curtis. Good choices there! Anyway, Even if I found this boring and decent at the same time, I would definitely stay away from the tragic, unworthy remake which didn't improve on this film at all.This pleased me a little bit. Haven't seen it in a while, maybe watching it again will change my mind.6.5/10",

In a way it was boring and it only had about 4 or 5 kills in total, so it's really nothing special when it comes to a body count. It did have a great suspenseful chase when Wendy is being chased by the man with the axe. It really seemed like a low budgeted movie from the 80's that leeches on the fact that it has one of the most notable and famous scream queens. Surprisingly Leslie Nielsen is in it for about 10 or 15 minutes at the most as Jaime Lee Curtis's father and tell you what he'd always be the last person I'd assume was in a slasher film. This movie had a good storyline though and a great twist at the end. Overall, I give it a 4 out of 10 which is actually not too bad because I gave Terror train a 3.",

It wasn't jumping on the excessive violence bandwagon either, featuring little gore. Unfortunately, I'm not sure the story it tells is actually any good, mainly because it provides odd character focus.Years ago, four kids accidentally kill a girl and cover it up. In the present day, well, these kids receive threatening phone calls, however the movie focuses primarily on the dead girl's brother and sister, who aren't actually in danger. Less important characters in jeopardy reduces the stakes and we really don't get much emotional investment in the potential victims - the most central is the boyfriend (maybe) of the dead girl's sister.",

So, giddy prom night nostalgia was not one of the motivators behind seeing this flick. I've avoided it for years, decades, presuming it was just a Carrie (1976) knockoff. I was both right and wrong and now glad I saw it.If you enjoy movies that use technology as a character in itself, as I do, be advised that Ma Bell is the channel of choice in Prom Night. I also enjoy movies that belie the shallow creepiness and danger of the suburbs. On these two scores, Prom Night delivers as many of them do.And speaking of scores, disco fans, both closeted and out, will want to just skip to the prom night set where Nielsen shows off his utter lack of rhythm (they should have put his dancing in Airplane (1980) instead of Prom Night), and Curtis shows what dance lessons, put to such good use in True Lies (1994), can accomplish. Fans of Sylvester will also enjoy the anonymous keyboard work, which recalls the great Patrick Cowley and his analog, arpeggiated wonders.So now I'm curious as to what the entire thing was supposed to have looked and sounded like and am now willing to go and hunt for that coveted Anchor Bay DVD.

Instead, she spends large parts of the movie disco dancing.  There's an extended chase through the deserted high school and a fairly impressive decapitation scene, but, otherwise, this one's not very memorable.

It's derivative of Carrie, Halloween, Friday the 13th, and perhaps a few others, and while it's no where on the level of those, it's still an enjoyable film on its own.\nIn a very creepy opening sequence set in 1970, Robin Hammond accidently falls to her death while being taunted in a morbid hide-and-seek variant called \"The Killers Are Coming.\" At the urging of shrewish Wendy, Robin's tormenters swear secrecy...little knowing that the accident has not gone unwitnessed. Now it's 1980, and the kids have all grown up and are ready for the senior prom. But strange things begin happening, as the teens are stalked by someone out for a decade-delayed revenge.As I said, this isn't exactly earth-shattering material, but Prom Night turns out as a slick, light slasher exercise with enough energy to make it fun. The acting is good and the characters are (mostly) very appealing, in contrast to the vapid bags of blood that populate similar affairs. Jamie Lee Curtis is terrific as the Prom Queen--and Robin's sister--and she gets to show off her dancing ability at the prom! This is undoubtedly the most bizarre point in the film, as the action comes to a three-minute halt as Jamie and Casey Stevens burn up the disco floor to the blasting title tune. The music, though not exactly Saturday Night Fever material, is pretty memorable--though Gordene Simpson's end-title song, \"Fade to Black,\" is haunting and beautiful. Leslie Nielsen (in a small role) gives one of his last dramatic performances before becoming a professional buffoon. Well-photographed and effective, with an excellent climax; I should add that I was surprised by the killer's identity, though I fell for that typical horror-movie trick of forgetting about the character's existence until the end.

Granted, the characters aren't very appealing (except for good ole Jamie Lee), but you can tell the filmmakers meant well. Not as good as TERROR TRAIN, but definitely worth any horror or Jamie Lee fan's time. Ending sequence is kind of emotional, with a pretty depressing song.",

Enter Prom Night 1980 and time for the old gang to part, but one by one, every witness who vowed secrecy over the girl's death, dies themselves at the hands of a balaclava-wearing, mirrorshard-wielding madperson.While the story line is pretty simple, the pace of the film is long and plodding. The aim of the makers, perhaps just beyond their aim, was the Hitchcockian premise of suspense. Prom Night was apparently strong enough to compete with cult classics Halloween, Friday The 13th, Carrie and Texas Chain Saw Massacre as one of the Favorite Fright Franchises of the 1980s. Fortunately, sequels in the Prom Night niche deep-sixed the awful disco theme, but the plots didn't improve that much and somehow the original remains the best of the batch.Leslie Nielson plays Mr. Hammond, Prom Night's high school principal in one of his funnier roles from the \"pre-Airplane\" days of his illustrious career. His ridiculous dance scene with daughter Kim (Jamie Lee Curtis) is probably what convinced the Zucker brothers to make Nielson \"their boy\" in future projects.Antoinette Bower, perhaps the best thing to ever come out of Owen Sound, Canada, does adequate work as Nielson's wife and Jamie Lee's mother. I still think of her role as a \"cat chick\" that Cap'n Kirk beds and betrays on that memorable Star Trek episode \"Catspaws\"...Canadian storyboardist Jeff Wilson, who was uncredited for his part in the latter half of the movie, should be given credit for injecting dynamic camera angles amid the quick cutting, fast moving action. Critically acclaimed director Paul Lynch indicated what kind of project this was when he told Maclean's magazine that \"Prom Night is the kind of film one must do to survive...\"3 1/2 Stars out of 5.

            "content": "\"Prom Night\", starring Jamie Lee Curtis and Leslie Nielson, is certainly a slasher movie but undoubtedly one of the worst of its kind. Why is was such a huge success in 1980 will be the biggest mystery that this low-budget Canadian flick has to offer. It is one of the most predictable films you will ever see, it isn't relatively scary or gruesome, and the entire production cost of the film seems to be misguided.The film is about a killer targeting four high school kids on the day of their prom who were responsible for the accidental death of a girl seven years beforehand. That's about all the movie has to offer. Both Jamie Lee Curtis and Leslie Nielson are not targets, and if really feels as if all their stardom is really wasted and that they were simply written into the script to have some kind of name behind the movie.Unlike \"Halloween\", which \"Prom Night\" almost directly clones at parts, this movie lacks the characterization and substance that creates a genuinely scary slasher movie. Its mystery is fruitless with no attempts at a plot twist. The entire first part of the film is just tiresome and boring.While \"Prom Night\" certainly is by no means a good slasher film, or film in general, it is a fun flick to observe. You most likely won't get scared by it, but there may be some laughs at the film, especially the goofy disco soundtrack that is truly one of the more memorable parts of the entire movie. Probably the best part of this movie is a chase scene involving one of the killer's targets through the school during the actual prom dance. The chase scene is actually very entertaining, well done, and overall suspenseful - in other words this ten minute chase scene is worth putting yourself through the rest of the movie. You won't be disappointed by that one part.\"Prom Night\" sort of has a very similar feeling to it that \"I Know What You Did Last Summer\" has. The latter, which is more famous in today's society and certainly a better overall movie, might be the one to look for if you are after a good, entertaining night. However if you are looking for a piece of 80's memorabilia, then \"Prom Night\" is the one to bring home.All DVD versions of \"Prom Night\" are pretty bare bones, offering up only a trailer at best. Prehaps when the 2008 remake, starring Brittany Snow of \"John Tucker Must Die\" is released, there may be a special edition of the original just for those who actually like it. \"Halloween\", \"The Fog\", and \"Terror Train\" are all Jamie Lee Curtis vehicles that are recommended over \"Prom Night\".",

            "content": "I haven't yet seen the remake and I probably won't due to the fact that most updatings are really unnecessary IF the original source material gets as much press and has the cult following that this film has. So, I dusted off my old full screen DVD copy AND an old wide screen VHS and revisited this cool trendsetter. I dig Jamie Lee Curtis and she fully deserves her scream queen status yet I have to admit that Anne Marie Martin AKA Eddie Benton successfully steals the film from JLC and everyone involved! Simultaneously vile and amazingly gorgeous (Anne's only equal at the time was the just as striking Deborah Harry), the 'wendy' subplot really helped move the film along even though it was just a portion of 'Carrie' (1976) revamped! And you really have to give a film serious credit when the supporting actress possesses the film and takes it away from the rightful star Curtis.While everyone knows the storyline (highschoolers stalked on Prom Night at an atmospheric coastal school) the film also benefits from a demanding visual style (i.e. intercutting of beginning storyline with the killer's phone calls, flashbacks of escaped fugitive, etc.) that is equal to another modest budget slasher flick around the same time: the very good 'Silent Scream' (1980) which I was lucky enough to see in a theater at the time ('Friday The 13th' (1980) was sold out!).So, nothing new to add just my two cents on why the film has cult status. Oh yeah, as for the soundtrack: serious collector's wet dream. Paul Zaza should re-issue this Disco SnDtRcK for the masses as I know many DJs as well as the average Joe would sell an appendage to own a copy of this.",

            "content": "Six years after a tragic accident kills a child, a masked killer stalks the people responsible during their high school prom.Prom Night is considered somewhat of a cult classic, but it's a sentiment I can't share. Before this latest re-watch, I had only seen the movie once, and my only memories of it were that Jamie Lee Curtis and Leslie Nielsen were in it, and that it featured rampant disco music.Honestly, that description pretty much sums the movie up; there is not much going on here. In fact, after the opening scene in which we see a child fall to her death after being bullied by some classmates, we don't get another kill until more than an hour into the movie. Between kills, the movie is clogged with subplots that don't matter, with the occasional threatening phone call from the killer to their future victims.That's not a good recipe for a slasher movie if you ask me. The kills don't help either, as the violence is mostly off-screen. You often hear of horror movies having to trim scenes to avoid an \"X\" rating; Prom Night had to add scenes to get an R rating, as producers thought the movie wouldn't sell well with a PG rating.The film invests heavily into the mystery of who the killer is, but it only partially succeeds in my opinion. The eventual killer makes sense and they had sound motivations, but I thought the film should have flushed out the rest of the suspects. According to the IMDB trivia page, there were three scenes that were cut from the movie that would've added significant depth to three of the side characters and set them up as suspects.Big mistake cutting those; by the end of the movie, it's pretty easy to figure out who the killer is. The movie tries one last ditch effort to throw suspicion at one character in particular by making them randomly vanish for the final half hour of the movie. But all that does is deprive the audience of one of the better performers in the film.Overall, pretty bad and generic movie. It works as a midnight slasher movie, but so little happens during the first hour that you might doze off (or find yourself playing solitaire on your phone... cough).",

Oddly enough, Nick was the catalyst for Robin's literal downfall that day; instead of warning her that Warpath Wendy would target her mercilessly and ushering her out of the building before the others caught him, he screamed \"Here Killers, Here!\" (which might have been one of their rules in case an outsider intervened), getting the attention of his three co-conspirators who literally scared Robin to death! Nick always seemed the guiltiest of the four, from the get-go when he started to mention that they needed to \"get somebody, quick!\" but outnumbered by the three girls, he agreed to the pact and still felt totally guilty six years later on the day of the prom during his romantic scenes with Kim.WHAT IF??? Nick ran home that day in 1974 and confessed everything to his father, Lt. McBride...who in turn was looking for a reason to capture local pedophile Leonard Murch, and decided to cover up his son's crime by blaming Murch, leading to his car explosion capture? McBride seemed to be a single father in the 1980 story, and I always thought he was a widower but there were no paintings or photos of Nick's missing mother in their apartment (but there was a framed photo by Nick's phone of him and another guy on a tennis court). I'm assuming that Mrs. McBride was devastated over her young son's malicious mayhem & subsequent coverup by her cop husband...so she flew the coop and left them both! (I know, like the mothers in Happy Birthday To Me and the original Scream did). Maybe Mrs. McBride was friends with Mrs. Hammond at the time and couldn't bear to see her friend suffer at the hands of her own family! And maybe she couldn't live with the fact that her husband framed an innocent man (at least at that time) of Robin's murder. Maybe Lt. McBride and Wendy's obviously wealthy unseen no-show father conspired to keep their children's crime a secret? I know all of this couldn't play out in the 90min movie (with the post-production tacked-on Leonard Murch scenes still in tact!).Speaking of Nick & Kim, after all that time...their Senior year romance seemed to be new since Wendy's jilted lover routine didn't come off as desperate like they've been fighting over him since they were 12!I just wonder about these things years later!",

He is as human as anyone and doesn't \"resuscitates\" like Jason or Freddy Krueger. Another favourable point is that \"Prom Night\" has very good actors, from the children cast to the grown up ones, including Leslie Nielsen as Jamie Lee Curtis' father. If you want to see an 'I Know What You Did Last Summer-kind-of-movie', then watch \"Prom Night\". You won't be disappointed.",

            "content": "It's still got a small unique charm that makes me watch it here and there. Made by the people responsible for \"Curtains\" (1983) It was actually a big money earner and in my opinion Curtains is far better film and much more appealing. It amazes me how Prom Night was watched by a lot more. The plot is nothing spectacular and it involves 4 dumb kids accidentally killing some mousy little girl who was one of the only sympathetic characters in the whole movie (and she dies like 5 minutes in!!!). Well these 4 kids don't need any convincing at all to keep the murder a secret and jump 6 years later and all the kids are somehow still all hanging around together, hell two of the girls are best friends with the little victims older sister, Thee Jamie Lee Curtis, and the only boy of the four is dating her as well, maybe they really despise Jamie lee? and are being nice to her because they have guilt. Jamie Lee was overrated in this and her character was really obnoxious, spoiled, and self proclaimed. I really wanted her to bite the big one. Well anyways, the day of the prom and all four teenagers start getting telephone calls by an unseen prowler with his yearbook and pencil. \"Tonight it's your turn\" or \"Do you still like to play games\"...the plot plods along by giving us red herrings left and right...everyone and their dead aunt was a suspect...you be the judge on how easy it was to spot the killer or how difficult it was..I had the killer revealed by my sister who saw the movie first. The big night arrives FINALLY and we have some nice kills and good stalk sequences firmly directed by Paul Lynch and accompanied by Paul Zanza's creepy score. Axe and ski mask in tow, the killer reveals his big bloodshed of a night...which was alright..under circumstances..meaning the tacky and horrible disco dance sequence. The acting in this movie was credible and watchable, but it was kind of hard to warm up to a lot of the characters because they all looked 30 and acted as if they were 12...did teenagers really act this way? The only character that was interesting was the one hated by everyone, the likable bitch \"Wendy\"...not only did she make fun of like everyone, she drove a corvette, looked sexy in that red dress, hated Jamie Lee as much as I did, and treated her house maid like yesterdays garbage. My kind of women! Why no one liked this dame was beyond me...she also had a 10 minute stalk scene sequence which was right up there with the \"Prop Room\" stalk in \"Curtains\". Stylish and fun.Leslie Neilson has nothing to do but say his lines and sulk here and there. Not much of a role. As for the rest of the cast...ACT YOUR AGE!!Note: I should mention the horny, geeky, drug induced fat couple that gets it on in a Van...they had me laughing my ass off. The directing was nice to look at but someone should have sacrificed those bottles of whiskey and lines off set and invested in some lights for the lighting. Was this movie shot with just a camera? I honestly believe this to be WORST MOVIE FOR LIGHTING! I couldn't see much at times and that really made me uninvolved. Why should I have to always have my flashlight in hand to watch this because someone partied to hard in 1980?For what it's worth, it's not that terrible or that great either..it's just a fun slasher that is horribly dated and has Jamie Lee Curtis camera mugging and some killer that would be a better tap dancer then a prowler.Clumsy moron! I expected him to start doing one of those slapstick tap routines at any moment...Paul Lynch later directed the abysmal and boring \"Humongous\" which also lost budget for lighting because someone liked to party...it was the early eighties so I guess you can't really blame them. The producers later helmed all 3 unrelated Prom Night sequels and of course the great \"Curtains\".** out of ****",

            "content": "\"Prom Night\" may not be a \"great movie\" (Besides \"Halloween\" and maybe \"Black Christmas\", what slasher move is?). But the 1980 \"Prom Night\" has some very interesting and original elements that sets it apart from its genre and makes it a very interesting watch, even in 2008:1. Jamie Lee Curtis- Besides \"Halloween\", this is her best acting role in a slasher movie, and some might argue that her portrayal of Kim Hammond in \"Prom Night\" even tops her role as Laurie Strode. And her dancing in this movie is just very interesting to watch, whether you are captivated by it or find it laughable.2. Wendy the \"you know what\", Jamie Lee's rival- Eddie Benton a.k.a. Anne Marie Martin, Michael Crichton's ex-wife, gives a great performance and is not to be missed in this role.3. The Music- Yes, it's composed of cheesy ripoffs of real disco hits, but that's its charm. And the quite original \"Fade to Black\" which ends the film is also excellent.4. The beheading- To say anymore would spoil too much, but the scene is pulled off masterfully and it is the only gore of any significance in the movie.5. The killer's phone calls- Very creepy, and they set the mood for the rest of the film.6. Lou Farmer- The local high school thug is the perfect complement to Wendy. In the end, his scheming with Wendy will create a bizarre twist to the killer's intentions on Prom Night.7. The Chase Scene- Though most of the killings in Prom Night are just average, the extended chase sequence across campus builds the suspense just right, even though the outcome seems inevitable.8. The Final Battle on the Dance Foor-Very well choreographed, with the outcome always in doubt until hatchet falls.9. Unmasking of the Killer- Pulled off in an unusual way. Instead of the mask being lifted, the camera looks at the masked assassin directly for the first time, and we recogignize right away who it is.10.The Unusual Ending- Some will not like it. They will want Jason Voorhees or Michael Myers jumping out at the screen. Instead, the ending is tearful and reflective.",

Oh the horror! *Spoilers* It isnt difficult to figure out who is doing the prank callin' and axe swingin' shenanigans either. Of course it was the younger brother that returned to the murder scene in the beginning, he was also the DJ at the prom and the only excuse for letting that same awful disco song play for twenty minutes at the end was that he was away from the 1's and 2's killing those brats. All in all a fun time waster that Im gonna give a 5/10. 2.5 points for \"Slick\" Evil Keneviling his van off a cliff and 2.5 for the great decapitation of the bully type figure.

It has all the familiar trappings of a typical slasher, but it feels a little off in some aspect. The real action seems to take forever to get going. This could be o.k. if there was something to tide you over, but there really isn't. The only thing that keeps you watching is the unusually talented cast of Jamie Lee Curtis, Leslie Neilsen, Casey Stevens, and Anne Marie Martin.The plot is a loose retelling of Lois Duncan's I Know What You Did Last Summer, but there's enough here to keep you interested. It's not totally original, but it has an interesting style to it. It feels more like an Italian giallo with it's black gloved killer, cryptic and threatening messages, obscene phone calls and it's strong use of color.It's still a fun movie with a shocking killer revelation and a great chase scene through a locked school building. The disco score is suitably nostalgic as well.",

            "content": "I first started watching PROM NIGHT about four or five years ago because it starred the famous Jamie Lee Curtis, but gave up on it about twenty-thirty minutes in just because nothing was happening. I finally managed to force myself to finish it, and it wasn't too bad.Ten years ago, four friends (Wendy, Kelly, Jude, and Nick) unintentionally made a girl their age fall to her death. Now, they're seniors and it's the day of the prom. All four have dates, and even Nick is going with Kim, the sister of the girl that died ten years prior. But on prom, someone begins killing them off one by one. Is it the principal, who was the father of the murdered girl ten years prior? Is it the brother of that girl? Is it the man who was convicted of the crime, but has escaped from a mental institution recently? Or is it the creepy gardener? PROM NIGHT really is an endurance test for slasher fans. The first fifty odd minutes consist of nothing but \"character-building,\" which mostly amounts to just talking about who's dating who and other crap. Granted, there are some entertaining characters and some of the character-building does succeed in creating likable characters, but it is still difficult to make it through that length of time unscathed.However, fifty minutes in, the prom begins. And that's when the fun begins. Flashing, colored lights, disco music, Leslie Nielson, and disco dancing. Nielson was in the film before the prom, but still. There's about a three-minute long period where Curtis's character (Kim) disco dances with her boyfriend. It's wonderful. There are some kills, but they're not that bloody. There is some great suspense, especially in the chase scene with Wendy. The film's most memorable moment, however, is when the ski-mask clad killer decapitates one poor teen (who he thinks is Nick), and his head rolls out onto the catwalk! I still stand by my theory that PROM NIGHT is only famous because of Ms. Curtis, but it's still a fun watch if you have the patience to wait for the last forty minutes or so. Gotta love that \"Prom Night\" disco song, though.",

Helped tremendously by a first-rate cast, a suspenseful chase scene and, of course, a fair amount of cheese, it's one of my favorites too. (warning: contains spoilers!)A young girl leaves her older sister and brother to sneak into an abandoned school where a group of kids are playing hide-and-go-seek. Her siblings leave her and she soon realizes that she is unwanted from the festivities. The children, sneering and shouting the likes of \"Murder!\", back the poor girl onto a ledge, from which she falls to her death through a flimsy glass window. The four children look in horror at the messy corpse on the ground and quickly make a pack not to tell anyone. They then hurry off to school, oblivious to the fact that soemone else was watching . . .\nA considerable amount of time passes and the four children have now grown up into the usual slasher movie stereotypes: Nick, the hunky prom king; Wendy, the wild girl; Kelly, the scaredy-cat virgin and Jude, the bubbly party girl. There's also Kim (Jamie Lee Curtis), the older sister of the young girl who died six years earlier. As Kim's high school starts to prepare for the senior prom, her friends begin receiving strange phone calls from a husky-voiced stranger. But it's not until that night, Prom Night, that the four friends begin meeting gruesome deaths at the hands of the ax-swinging killer in black.Despite it's fairly good reputation PROM NIGHT cannot be considered a good movie. In fact, it's pure camp: The constant disco music that plays in the background of each murder, the cheesy SATURDAY NIGHT FEVER-like disco dance sequence between Kim and her boyfriend, and, of course, the infamous \"decapitated-head-on-a-walkway\" gag. That said and done there are a few things to reccomend this. Besides the very good performances, not just from Curtis and Leslie Nielson, but also from Eddie Benton, there are a number of good set pieces, the best being the chase through the darkened halls of the school between Benton and the killer. And the scene where the killer thinks he killed Nick but in fact just decapitated the greasy school punk is very good. Unfortunately, the killer's identity is very obvious: Leslie Nielson is set up as the red herring but we all know it won't be him.Still, PROM NIGHT is a very fun slasher film, and while not one of the best, a huge improvement on others of its kind.*** (out of ****)",

Cut to 1980, several years later, where the girl's older sister (Curtis) and brother are planning to go to the prom. We are also introduced to a couple of friends, who are the now much older kids from the beginning, including Nick who is now Jamie's boyfriend and future prom king. It's not before long that the teens start to get phone calls from a mysterious stranger. Then, at the prom (as if you didn't see it coming) they begin getting killed off. Now, this movie does have everything (except for the gory deaths), including a hilarious dance sequence and an exciting chase scene between one of the girls and the, rather clumsy, killer. The very end too does provide some great cheesey momments.  It's not that this movie is BAD, it's just . . . obvious. And the lighting during the chase scene near the end is awful.

SPOLIERS: The story begins with 4 elementary-aged kids playing a twisted little hide-n'-seek game in an old abandoned school house.Young Robin, who was on her way to school with sister Kim, and brother Alex, decides to join the group.They end up taunting her and backing her against a window, in which she crashes to her death.The four kiddies, led by Wendy, agree to never speak of the incident.This is 1974,--now we flash ahead to 1980.6 years have passed, and Kim is now the girlfriend of Nick, one of the 4 kids involved in the tragedy.All are in high school, preparing for graduation.            \nOn the day of the prom,the 4 culprits receive chilling, anonymous threatening phone calls.This is one of the fine qualities of the movie,to me.We see a shadow on the wall of a dark room, and the names of the 4 phone-call recipients on a piece of paper.Jude, Kelly, Nick, and Wendy are all the targets of the killer.An eerie twist is the way in which the killer taps with his pencil, as he dials up his victims on the telephone, it's quite creepy.  We also see the yearbook, opened next to the phone and sheet of paper.The threatening phone calls are one of the things that stand ot nicely in this film, and the creepy way they are carried out.

            "content": "PROM NIGHT, while not better than HALLOWEEN or FRIDAY THE 13TH, stands as one of the best slasher movies ever made. Head and shoulders above some of the new wave stuff. STORY-On a script level, this movie was tight. We start with the death that sets the entire story in motion and then we flash forward six years later. The guilty party responsible have all grown up and are ready to attend their senoir prom. Then the tension starts building. The escape mental patient. The creepy phone calls. Morbid notes. This happens through the first hour as we get to know the characters and climaxes in one big blood bath at the Prom. One thing I loved about the movie is how it plays off Halloween. At first we're expecting the story to take the Michael Myers route, but later we're given something completely different. The twist at the end was both surprising and logical. Not to mention heart wrenching. Pacing-wise, everything moves at a perfect pace. I never got bored with this movie and nothing was ever rushed. I have only two complaints. One is that there's a subplot ripped straight out of CARRIE. The other is that damn disco sequence. I was going to give this flick a perfect score before I had to endure THAT. I like seeing a young Jamie Lee Curtis throwing her body around as much as the next guy but the MUSIC....oh, it's horrid. ACTING-Leslie Nelson is always a pleasure to watch and it was funny to see him acting serious after seeing in all those damn NAKED GUN movies. Jamie Lee Curtis is great as usual. We also get the impression that her character isn't virginal in this one...I dug that. Casey Stevens does a good job of conveying the guilt that his character felt and comes across as a guy you would want to hang with....only if he got rid of that damn afro. Anne Marie Martin plays the bitch well and gives a bit of depth to her character, but has her moments of bad acting. Michael Tough is likeable as Curtis' brother and Pita Oliver won be over as the virgin whose having problems losing her virginity. Obviously no one is oscar worthy, but for a slasher film we get more than adequate performances. The killer is a bad  DIRECTING: Paul Lynch takes a few pages from John Carpenter's book and does well for himself. Some atmosphere. Some suspense. Some great camera angles. Just like John Carpenter's and Sean Cunningham's talents were very responsible for the quality of HALLOWEEN and F13, Lynch made PROM NIGHT as good as it was. This is how slasher movies SHOULD be made.MUSIC: The score wasn't anything special and disco is always terrible.BG+P-The violence is mostly offscreen (save for one kick ass decapitation) and the nudity is mostly non-frontal (save for one quick tit shot.) PROM NIGHT isn't spectular, but it wasn't trying to be. It was a little horror film with a lot of quality. This is where the inferior I KNOW WHAT YOU DID LAST SUMMER got it's plot. If you dig HALLOWEEN or F13 and are currently in the mood for another old school slasher, this is the movie you want. Only marred by that goddamn disco sequence...***1/2 out of ****",

Jamie Lee looks her scream queen best, playing Kim Hammond.  Just happens that today is the Prom and 6 years ago to the day Kim's sister was killed falling out a window.  That is a bit of a bummer for Kim and her brother but it does not stop Kim from pressing on as prom queen. The real bummer is someone is stalking Kim and her friends.  Breaking mirrors, making wierd phone calls and cutting up yearbooks are this psycho's MO.  Could it be the slackjawed janitor, the hometown sex offender, or Leslie Neilsen, who disappears before the finale of the movie?  Who knows? Who cares!  We are here to watch Jamie Lee get down with her bad self.  The \"Let's show them what we can do\" dance sequence makes this movie worth the price of admission.  Students of the movie Carrie will find a whole host of similarities.  Required genre and cheeseball viewing.",

            "content": "Prom Night is a very interesting slasher movie because it really does have so much potential to be an amazing slasher movie but the main problem for me with this movie is that the entire middle of the movie is pointless, there's no slashing or nothing that you need to know to understand the final act.\nYou could go from watching the first act of the movie to the third act and really not missed anything at all.The Scream Queen herself Jamie Lee Curtis makes an appearance as the \"main girl\" even though as much as I love JLC her role in this movie is just completely pointless and she was obviously just added on to the cast to stream off of her success from Halloween.Although this movie has it downsides it does also have its ups, I thought for an 80's Canadian slasher movie the acting in this movie was pretty decent especially a certain mean girl character who has one of the best chase scenes I've seen in a slasher movie.\nShe put up one good fight and even DELAYED her inevitable fate for as long as she possibly could.\nOkay movie! Satisfying ending! Too much disco! Not enough kills!",

            "content": "Prom Night is one of the bigger names when it comes to the early 80's slasher boom. Why? I'm assuming it's due to the casting of Jamie Lee Curtis (in a strange, semi-lead role that has her disappear from the action for a good chunk of the film). It's far from the best slasher, it's slow as molasses at times, and there's hardly any gore, but there's a pleasant attention to characters and performance that's noticeably absent in other slashers. The disco soundtrack and a well orchestrated chase sequence during the finale makes it worthwhile and memorable. The final sequence is also unique in that it actually attempts to add a little heartbreaking pathos into the mix. You certainly won't get that in Friday the 13th Part 7.",

            "content": "I usually enjoy slasher movies. I love Friday the 13th, Halloween, Black Christmas, and April Fool's Day. However, this one I didn't like and felt that it was weak. This movie has a lot of flaws. To start off, the acting was horrendous. You can clearly tell that they were acting. Next, it was too slow to get to the action. There were some scenes that lasted way too long. For example, the disco dancing scene. At first it was entertaining and funny, but after watching them not being able to dance well for 5 minutes, the novelty wore off. Also, the kill scenes were lame. The only good one was when Lou got decapitated. All of the others were disappointing. Finally, It was too predictable. With these types of films, I want the killer's identity to shock me, but this one just had me saying \"I knew it!\" I did like the creepy music, but that was about all that I liked.",

            "content": "A masked killer stalks a high school prom, hoping to snuff out the teenagers responsible for the accidental death of one of their classmates 6 years ago.Though it's sold as a vehicle for Jamie Lee Curtis (then, fresh off Halloween and The Fog), it's more of an ensemble piece with each victim a little more finely drawn than most films of this type. Of course, this comes at a price with the film's pacing lagging to a crawl at several moments and the unnecessary red herring subplot involving an escaped mental patient could have been left out altogether. Once the film reaches the titular prom, it starts firing on all cylinders and ends up being pretty terrific, but it takes about an hour for that to happen and I wouldn't blame less patient viewers from checking out before that point.",
