            "content": "The Sandlot is one of the greatest kids movies ever. It is a refreshing break from the family movies of today that mostly concentrate on stories in that upperclass Reiner-esque suburbanite setting of husband and wife and two and a half obnoxious kids. Instead, The Sandlot falls into a line of memorable adventures like 'House Arrest' and 'The Wizard.'Flashback to the 1960s. Scotty Smalls, newcomer to the neighborhood, narrates (in a Wonder Years way) the hilarious adventure of how he got he and his baseball playing buddies into the biggest pickle ever. Smalls is the shy brainy kid who makes friends with a bunch of baseball fanatics. While learning the sport of baseball, he learns of an exaggerated legend of something called 'The Beast,' otherwise known as Old Mr. Myrtle's junkyard dog, which is chained up in the fence just behind the ballpark. The kids like to play baseball. And the Beast likes to eat them. Not to give too much away, but, \"the pickle\" that Scotty gets his friends into, involves a pretty valuable baseball, one slobbering beast, and kids who try to do anything they can to save their buddy from being grounded for an eternity. The mess they get into and the junk they try to get themselves out is simply hilarious. That, and the subplots of a clever move on a lifeguard and the determination to show up some very obnoxious rival baseball players.\nIt's a funny, fantastic film that most kids will likely enjoy--the boys for baseball and the girls for those noteable teen stars like Mike Vitar, Tom Guiry, Chauncey Leopardi, and Will Horneff. It's loaded with laughs and good time adolescents, despite Tom Guiry hamming it up only slightly. Plus, it's got a good theme about friendship and drive and determination to do what you want to do. I highly recommend it, if for nothing else, then the part where Squints tells the story about the history of the beast.\nI can see from the message boards as well as other viewer's comments that it still has a rather memorable following, despite it's age. Definitely a must see!",

            "content": "Okay, I didn't grow up in the time this film is set (I was born in 1978). But after seeing the film, I've got a pretty good idea of what it was like. My dad likes the film because of how much it reminds him of his own childhood. The story is simple: a new kid moves with his mother and step-father to a brand new neighborhood where he knows no one. So imagine his surprise when he winds up meeting a kid who invites him to play baseball with him and his best friends. Naturally, the other kids don't take to him too well: he's not very good at baseball, and he can't even throw right. But eventually, the kids grow to like him and teach him the ways of the game, and before long they're having a lot of fun during the summer. THE SANDLOT is a great kids film, very family-friendly, unlike the majority of so-called \"family\" films that are made nowadays. Sure, there's a scene where the kids are throwing up on a carnival ride thanks to some chewing tobacco, but the scene is done more for laughs than as a gross-out. (You can imagine that the scene would be done the opposite way if the film was made more recently). The characters and the young kids playing them are all appealing, and it's nice to see Denis Leary playing a kind sensitive role instead of the over-the-top characters he's used to playing. He's very good, even though the part's not a big one. The few scenes between him and star Tom Guiry are very nice. THE SANDLOT is a very good film. Kids will like the humor, and adults will remember how fun it was to be a kid.",

That's rare, as often \"family films\" have too much smutty language or sexual situations for kids OR are so saccharine sweet that sane adults would prefer suicide over watching the films (think Disney in the 1960s).The film isn't quite a comedy, though there are really funny moments in it (such as the evil dog that eats baseballs). And, it's not exactly a drama. It's more like an occasionally surreal slice of life film about the good old days of the late 50s-early 60s. It's about a group of kids that live to play baseball--and that's all they ever seem to want to do! Despite this very simple plot, somehow the excellent acting, direction and writing make you really care about the kids and it engages you from start to finish.",

The Sandlot is about a gawky kid named Smalls(Tom Guiry) who just moves into the neighborhood and tries to blend in with the crowd, until he fails. Mike Vitar who plays the neighborhood baseball hero Benny, helps Smalls play baseball and fit him in with the crowd. The team accepts Smalls and what makes the film interesting like i written above is that this film isn't about winning or losing, but about living your days in the summer when you are ten to twelve and realize that there is more to life than winning.\nOverall a great movie.",

When Smalls becomes curious with a group of kids (Mike Vitar, Patrick Renna, Chauncey Leopardi, Marty York, Brandon Quintin Adams, Grant Gelt, Shane Obedzinski and Victor DiMattia), who plays Baseball all day long in a old baseball field. Smalls is hoping to play with them but he knows nothing about the game. When he tries to play, he's quite bad at all. He can't even throw a ball to the catchers. When he becomes friend with the leader of the game and Smalls starting to like the game. But when his stepfather goes away for business, Smalls take a baseball from his stepfather trophy room. Which without realizing that the ball, he took from the room is actually signed by the Baseball Legend \"Babe Ruth\". Smalls hits his first home run, the ball went over the fence of a old house. But that old house, it has an mean-spirited junkyard dog. Which the kids called him \"The Beast\". Now the kids have to help Smalls to get the ball back before his stepfather comes back from the business trip.Directed by David M. Evans (First Kid) made an likable family comedy that plenty of funny moments, a good cast and a lot of imagination. The narration of the film will certainly make you remember of the late Bob Clark film \"A Christmas Story\", although the narration of \"The Sandlot\" is sightly heavy-handed at times. This film has a surprise hit, when it was release in the spring of 1993. Fox had another fantasy film about Baseball, which it was \"Rookie of the Year\". James Earl Jones, Art LaFleur and a young Marley Shelton have memorable bit parts in this pleasant comedy as well.DVD has an sharp anamorphic Widescreen (2.35:1) transfer (Also in Pan & Scan) and an good Dolby Digital 5.1 Surround Sound. DVD also includes an featurette, trailer and TV spots. This film went on to be an modest classic over the year. All the kids have their moments, especially Renna and Leopardi have their comedic moments. The movie slows down a bit during the second act. But it's well made and this picture pleases everyone as well. It's one of the better family movies of the 1990's. Don't miss it. Co-Written by the director. Arliss Howard appears Unbilled. Followed by Two Direct to DVD's. Joe-Dunton-Camera Scope (J-D-C Scope). (****/*****).",

I saw it during summer and after watching it I felt the energy for new adventures! The best thing is, years after that I saw the movie again during another summer and it reminded me so hard on the good times one can have as a youngster outside... I went for adventures again.As many other reviewers have noticed, this movie reminds us of what it was like to be a kid, and when dogs were dangerous monsters, and playing outside was just a huge adventure. Everybody of us felt like an Indiana Jones. It felt damn good.This is one of the movies I will carefully hold on and keep it, lets say to watch it all couple of 6 years just to remind me how cool life can be. The movie captures all our youth so well and packs it in one huge summer so watch and love this one.An absolute 10/10 for being THE kid movie of my life and guess what? I am an adult but I love watching this one. Your turn now.",

            "content": "THE SANDLOT is quite possibly one of the best \"family films\" ever made. In it, a young, studious, unpopular boy named Scotty Smalls (Tom Guiry) moves to a suburb just before school lets out for the summer, and concurrently has a hard time making friends. He frequently sees kids playing baseball in a sandlot in his neighborhood, and wants to make friends with them. He figures the best way to do this is to join in on their baseball games--but alas, Scotty has almost no baseball skills, while the other kids are very experienced and good at the game. One day, the neighborhood hero Benny (Mike Vitar) approaches Scotty and asks if he'd like some pointers and to join in on their game. Scotty agrees, and slowly improves, while making friends with the other boys in the neighborhood.But one day, Scotty foolishly takes his stepfather's baseball autographed by Babe Ruth and knocks it into the adjacent backyard. This backyard, as Scotty is informed, is home to The Beast, a monstrous dog that, as legend has it, ate the only other boy who was daring enough to go after a baseball in that yard. The boys devise a plan to get the ball back, one way or another.I watched THE SANDLOT several times growing up, and remember always loving it. When I watched it again recently, I realized exactly why--it's a great movie. Just the right balance of childhood innocence and experience is captured, and this movie is bound to make any adult remember his childhood and all the different aspects of it. The summertime atmosphere and almost all of the scenes are terrifically nostalgic. Some of the scenes involving The Beast are hilarious, and everything has a nice familiar feel to it. It's a wonderful feel-good film.All of the actors put in at least average performances. Most of the child actors are just okay, with a few exceptions. Tom Guiry is good as the awkward and naive Scotty, as is Patrick Renna as the outspoken and witty Hamilton. I think the real standout of the actors, though, is Mike Vitar as Benny. He was excellent as the kindhearted, but still very cool hero of the neighborhood, the guy that everyone loved. He showed real promise, and it's a shame that he didn't continue with his acting career. The cameos from James Earl Jones and Denis Leary are also nice.I always loved watching THE SANDLOT growing up, and now I remember why. It's a great family film that is very entertaining and enjoyable to watch. I'm sure I'll watch it again years from now and remember just why I loved it. 8/10.",

It's got kind of a \"Stand by Me\" vibe, and if you're not into baseball, there's still much to be enjoyed through the childhood memories the movie is sure to evoke in many. It's not as funny as I thought it would be. That's not a criticism of the movie, because it doesn't try to be super funny. It's just not the kind of comedy I was led to believe it would be, so my expectations were a bit disappointed.

But you do what you can, which means learning the game. Things are going smoothly until the one day, when you find yourself in the world's biggest pickle -- sending your father's baseball (signed by Babe Ruth) into the neighbor's yard, which is guarded by a creature known simply as \"The Beast\".I watched this film on my birthday with my best friend Chelsea, not really knowing what to expect. I figured that not unlike her other preferred films lately (\"Mighty Ducks\", \"Little Giants\"), it would be a sports underdog film. Well, it's not. Sure, it features kids who come from less-than-wealthy upbringings, but it doesn't have anything to do with them facing off against another \"superior\" team. Just kids, a baseball and a beast.This film will appeal to kids and to adults who wan to be kids. It's a good, clean film with no nudity or violence and only a small amount of cursing. Good for the whole family. The father, who appears only briefly, is played by Denis Leary, but it's not the stand-up Leary or the Leary from \"Judgment Night\" -- it's the one from \"Operation Dumbo Drop\". So expect foul language and you'll be gravely disappointed.I really enjoyed the surreal quality of the beast, how it was played up to be a dinosaur or some other mythical creature. I also liked the Rube Goldberg methods to retrieve the ball. I was a little doubtful that anyone wouldn't know who Babe Ruth was, as the main character doesn't. Sure, you might spend all day reading Popular Science, but it's Babe Ruth. The name itself far surpasses what anyone knows of him.I loved this film. It helped that I watched it with one of my favorite people, but at the same time it was just enjoyable in general. It's nice to have a film that's not raunchy or too cerebral -- just a relaxing trip back to the days of our childhoods (like the protagonist, I also spend more time reading than anything physical).

Because \"The Sandlot\" came out around the same time as the movie \"Rookie of the Year\". While \"Rookie of the Year\" got all of the media hype and had all of the big celebrities staring in it, but after you saw both of the movies, you realized that \"Rookie of the Year\" was nothing but the lame over-hyped move, and \"The Sandlot\" was the worthwhile movie.As far as I'm concerned, this movie will most likely remain in the #1 spot of kids movies for all eternity.",

But at the same time this reminds me of my childhood because my brother played baseball with all the neighborhood kids in our side yard and we always spent our summers outside or at the neighborhood pool just as the kids in the movie did.Besides, the nostalgia I'd say this movie is right up there with \"A Christmas Story\" or \"Ferris Buller's Day Off\" as far as extremely recognizable quotes go. Nearly anyone will know what movie you're talking about when you say them.\"You're Killing me Smalls!\" --- \"FOR-EV-ER\" --- \"THE BEAST\" --- \"The great Bambino?

            "content": "Watching \"The Sand lot\" is a lot of fun. The new kid in the block who doesn't know squat about baseball learns a lot about the game during its 101 minute running time. This tale of initiation resembles an Arthurian myth about a knight slaying a dragon. Our pint-sized knights are playing baseball when the protagonist accidentally loses his stepfather vintage Babe Ruth autographed baseball. The child actors are a likable lot and director David M. Evans orchestrate the action with enough flair to make these suburban shenanigans memorable. The first half of \"The Sandlot\" acquaints us with the adolescent adventurers as they accept the outsider and mold themselves into a single unit. Once our hero swats his first four-bagger, he becomes friends with his compatriots. The moment that he achieves this zenith of sorts, he creates the chaos that truly solidifies their group. All along Scotty Smalls (Tom Guiry of \"Ride with the Devil\") has said that he knows who 'the Great Bambino' is, but he doesn't. One day after his best friend, Benjamin Franklin Rodriguez (Mike Vitar of \"Sunset Grill\"), hits a home run, the guys are left without a baseball. Nobody has enough cents to buy one. Nevertheless, Scott wants to cement his friendship with the group and contribute something. He takes the prized baseball with Babe Ruth's John Hancock on the cowhide and offers it to the guys. Of course, they don't know that the ball Scotty has supplied is a trophy ball. Scotty attain his moment in the sun with his home run. Now, the kids have to figure out how to retrieve the baseball. Hatched a nerd, Scotty concocts several nerdy contraptions to enable them to recover the ball from the backyard where a monstrous watch dog with a reputation lives. Through the action, Evans appropriates every opportunity to build up the dog until it becomes the equivalent of a dragon. Eventually, Benny ventures over the fence in his brand new P.F. Flyer sneakers, retrieves the ball, but the Beast (an English Mastiff) pursues him relentlessly through backyards, a movie theater, a Founder Day Fair, and the swimming pool. The dog turns out to be more than a beast that ate a child. James Earl Jones plays the owner of Hercules. Like I said, \"The Sandlot\" is a whole lot of fun.",

In the summer of 1962, a bat and a ball is like life's blood. The sandlot is like a home away from home; a place for a young boy to exercise his fantasy and spend the best hours of summer. A good smack will send the ball sailing over the fence to never be seen again for it lands in Mr. Mertle's(James Earl Jones)backyard, which is guarded by a humongous dog...a super slobbering dog that devours just about anything and everything. The high drama and dilemma of the summer is trying to retrieve a Babe Ruth autographed ball from the territory of the big ass junkyard dog, Goliath. Other cast members of note: Patrick Renna, Mike Vitar, Chauncey Leopardi, Denis Leary and Karen Allen. THE SANDLOT is nostalgic, sentimental and stuffed full of innocence and humor.

However, after (and during the second viewing), he began a waterfall of childhood memories that I had never heard before.  Of long summers of \"sandlot\" games with him and his cousins (they were known as \"the cousins\") they could play baseball and football and kicked the butt of most of the teams in town, during the movie his memories spewed forth as if they had been bottled up and just needed to be set free. His friend actually did the \"lifeguard\" thing, pretended to drown to kiss her, and like the movie they were all banned from the pool.  They also had a \"scary guy\" in the old house that everyone was terrified of (in fact so did I as I recall).  He assures me that this movie is as faithful a retelling of a childhood in the 60s as he has ever seen, and he revels in it.

            "content": "When one thinks back to their childhood, way back in the day, for many of us, the thoughts of those glorious days of old, spent on the hallowed grounds, those neighborhood diamonds and fields with our buddies, comes flashing back. As a writer of three successful books, I used that very experience during my own youth to write, \"The Golden Arm Gentleman\", about a generation growing up in a much different time than it is today. It was a time when playing ball was all that seemingly mattered. My neighborhood guys, although we would occasionally butt heads, we always seemed to have each other's backs when it really mattered. The movie Sandlot seemed to amazingly capture that very spirit; of that glorious time in the summer, when we were up early playing ball all day long, right up until our mothers called us in for dinner. But the real awesomeness of this film, I mean the real magic here, comes from the writers, and their insightful abilities to have assembled a cast of players, that we all knew very well, because, well, they played in our sandlot games too. Of course, we all had a Smalls on our team, you know, that one guy that initially couldn't hit his way out of a wet paper bag, but by summer's end, was hitting the ball like Pete Rose. And there was always a Benny Rodriquez, the best player on the field, but his modesty and caring nature always shined even brighter than his playing abilities. We all had that big catcher behind the plate, that next to eating, playing ball all day long, was all that really mattered to him. Yes, they were all there; the intellectual guy, the pitcher on the mound who emulated the various pitching styles of the day (Seaver, Gibson, Koufax, Jim Palmer), even the small nerdy guy with the glasses (who was tough as nails by the way). Bravo to the movie Sandlot, for giving many of us a chance to relive our childhood, that of playing the summer game that we loved more than life itself, with our guys from the neighborhood. It's a grand reflection from a much different time, when we were out on America's sandlots physically playing the game, not sitting behind a computer screen playing a video version of it. And atlas, it was a much different, easier time than it is today. But I'm so very glad that I was able to be a part of it.",

During those endless summers, children would go out and play all day with other neighborhood kids their same age. Nothing in particular to do, no responsibilities other than enjoying yourself with your friends. Those childhood friendships were special, for those friends were your companions and mates in all you did. As Stephen King wrote in The Body (the inspiration for the film Stand By Me) \"I never had any friends later on like the ones I had when I was twelve. Jesus, does anyone?\"And this movie, without a great plot or a great anything, somehow manages to capture that magic, and that is why people like it and praise it.",

            "content": "Baseball has always been one of my favorite sports, there was always something so thrilling about hitting that baseball and running as fast as you can to certain points all to lead back to where you started. But also just simply the beautiful outdoor enviorment and company you played with.This film is one of my favorite films of all time and another childhood gem of mine. It's also my favorite sports film of all time if you can believe that. This really is a truly unique sports film because it's not one that is centered around a team on a journey to a championship, a single underdog player rising, or any other clich\u00e9 format your familiar with.The film was simply a slice of life movie just about a group of kids playing a game and having a good time which to me is what the essence of sports is. Watching this film now as an adult makes the film even better to me because it's sort of like looking at a passage in a journal, helping me remember the good times I played baseball as a kid.I really like the Sandlot kids they all have good chemistry and I really like the fact that they all look like ordinary kids, there not some people from the damn CW but the kind of people you pass by and see everyday which really gave the film a relatable feel to it. They look like the kind of friends I've had as a kid as each of them are unique, their not the kind of people that are popular in school nor are each of them (except for Bennie) likely destined to be Baseball stars in the future. But it didn't matter nor did they care they just care about having fun and being together which is the basis of every sport.Even the location of where it takes place adds to it, the worn out Baseball field they play in \"The Sandlot\" adds to the feel, because I remember playing in fields like this in the park or school playground.My favorite character has always been Ham. His character is just great, he has a lot of attitude but just some of the best lines my favorite line \"Your killing me Smalls!\" Another that I like is Squints whom is pretty much a nerd, but he's a character I can sort of relate to a bit as he's highly imaginative when he tells that story about the Beast which I find hilarious as it is clearly just an urban legend blown out of proportion; I have an active imagination too and like to make stories. But also how he harbors a crush on that unattainable girl Wendy, yeah I've been there too.The film is just made up of lots of scenes in the first and second half of the film which is pretty much just summer days and times.From that pool scene which always cracks me up as we see Squints engineer a scheme to get Wendy's lips to his, what makes this even funnier is what we hear about the two in the end. The game against some jerk baseball team and just hearing Ham just psyche each of the members batting. Or even the infamous amusement park scene which I found hilarious because it's true as we all might have done a really dumb thing or two as a kid and learned our lesson the hard way.Then of course there is the third half which is getting the lost Babe Ruth ball from the Beast. It's just funny and interesting seeing how the Sandlot kids are just finding all these inventive ways to retrieve the ball, surprised they haven't though of participating in the science fair. But it comes down to one of my favorite chase scenes ever which is awesome as it's a foot chase and it just goes on to different locations, it's practically like a Marathon.The film I also feel is somewhat of a tribute to both Babe Ruth and the sport Baseball. The Babe is constantly mentioned in this film and of course there is the ball itself. And the film is also a period piece as it takes place in the 60's which makes perfect sense since that was a time when the game was still young and growing. The fact these are just ordinary kids playing the game without affiliations to major teams really shows the roots of where Baseball originated before it became a major business it was simply just an ordinary game for people to enjoy anytime they want and it still is.The Sandlot is a home run.Rating: 4 stars",

            "review_title": "`Smalls, you're killin' me!'",
            "content": "Normally when I write reviews, I really try to make an effort to stay away from cheesy lines that come off as little more than weak efforts to be witty, such as starting my review off with a memorable quote from a film, but in this case, I just couldn't resist. The quote above (which, on watching the movie again, seems not to be even in it, but rather the line `You're killin' me, Smalls!,' but over the years since I had least seen the movie, the first one seems to have stuck with me more) is such a classic line of preteen comedy that I simply could not leave it out of my review. Granted, starting my review out with it is only slightly less cheesy than starting out a review of Star Wars with the line, `May the force be with you,' but I think that The Sandlot is a much more overlooked film than Star Wars (all of which are ANYTHING but overlooked). It almost always seems true that, in films like this (and most light-hearted comedies, now that I think about it), everyone seems to love the fat kid. Consider Stand By Me, in which Vern Tessio is the clumsy but lovable fat kid. Completely devoid of any kind of grace, but we love him anyway. In The Goonies, Chunk was arguably the most charming and lovable kid in the entire film, permanently imprinting our memories with such things as the Truffle Shuffle, his hilarious love of even the most obscure flavors of ice cream, and his clumsiness involving such things as ceramic statues and glass water cooler bottles (`Hope it's not a deposit bottle!'). In The Sandlot, we get yet another lovable character who fits in perfectly even with the very memorable ones mentioned above, as Patrick Renna gives a hilarious first film performance as the charmingly named Ham Porter, a red-headed fat kid with conflicting loves of food and baseball. The thing that really makes The Sandlot such a good film is that these kids childhoods are so effectively captured. There are some digressions of reality presented throughout the story, such as the sheer magnitude of Hercules as well as the kids very ability to create and use some of the huge and complex devices that they used to try to get the signed ball back, but that's because this is childhood. We are seeing the world through the eyes of a bunch of 12-year-olds, and these heroic things are just the kinds of things that they see as necessary to get their ball back from the fearsome beast. There are several other scenes, as well, that reflect the idea that much of this film is not made up of things that happen in every young boy's life, but things that every young boy WISHES would happen in his life. Consider, for example, the scene where these kids kick the hell out of an older and presumably more skilled group of players, who enter the film just long enough to be taunted and then badly beaten by them, as well as the scene where Squints manages to make out with the much older blonde lifeguard, and then is then lucky enough to get a bemused wave out of her afterwards rather than an endless series of dirty looks (and, MUCH later, he also manages to get NINE kids out of her). (spoilers) However far the film goes into childhood fantasy, it can be forgiven at the end because the deceptive simplicity of reality comes crashing in at the end of the film, as Mr. Myrtle (James Earl Jones) asks them why they didn't just knock on his front door and ask for the ball, he would have gladly gone to get it for them. This not only causes them all to slap their foreheads, but also reminds the audience of one of the film's themes, that the world is not as scary as it seems when you're a kid. It remains at least slightly questionable about why baseballs disappeared in such sheer numbers into the beast's yard and not a single kid went to the door to ask for his ball back, but consider the fact that, even as adults, we expected to find an owner who hates kids and would scream at them if they even came close to his front door. He lives in scary looking house, has this monstrous dog in the backyard, and no one seems to have ever seen him. Where the films seems to go a little wrong is in the actual character of Mr. Myrtle, who is so polite and generous and happy and charming that it seems impossible that he has not become more involved in the social atmosphere of his neighborhood and town, regardless of whether or not he can see. It's just a little too convenient that he happens to have been a personal friend of Babe Ruth (not to mention actually PLAYED with him), and that he would so easily give these kids (who have just destroyed his back fence) a baseball signed by the entirety of the 1927 Yankees. However, even though the film seems to go too far in this respect, it is such a satisfying ending to see that these kids have made new friends (in Mr. Myrtle as well as in Hercules), met a baseball legend, solved their conflict, AND learned a lesson about life, that we are willing and able to forgive any exaggerations in Mr. Myrtle's character. The character that would seem to be even more bothersome in an exaggerated respect is the impossibly charismatic and talented Benny, whose desperate efforts to include everyone and to be helpful and positive when the clumsy and talentless Scotty Smalls attempts to join their game suggest that his character was written by an adult (or adults) who are either trying to push across a message about not making fun of the new kid, or who were made fun of as children themselves (and believe me, I know what that's like).\nRegardless, however, of any characters that may not fit in perfectly with what real life is like, these alterations in reality are to be expected in this film given the fact that the vast majority of it is seen through the eyes of young boys, and what we ultimately get is another exciting childhood adventure tale that delivers morals without us even really realizing it. It's so refreshing to see such an entertaining film deliver so many good messages without stopping to spell them out or to be too blunt about them. The Sandlot is a great story that fits in well with it's other classic counterparts, such as The Goonies and Stand By Me, mentioned above, and it carries the rare distinction of being one of the few films that will remain as fun and entertaining for generations to come as it was for it's first generation (mine) back in 1993.",

The goofy loud one, the pint-sized one with the stand-out ears, and the serious one without much of a father around.  Loved it - and loved the James Earl Jones part.  What a joyful laugh he has!If you love kids, love baseball, love summer, and love a nice warm film, see it.  It has ended up in our library of films we watch again and again.

However, only one or two posts touched on what I thought was the most adult theme of the movie. After many comedic attempts to outwit The Beast, Scotty Small dreams about a giant baseball pile-driving him into the ground. However, Benny has a dream featuring the \"great Bambino.\" When Babe Ruth visited Benny in his dream, he imparted the advice that Benny had to decide if he were going to face his fear or not. Benny could hardly wait. He was up early, urging Scotty to get dressed and get to the \"sandlot.\" When the gang gathered, all the boys were trying to dissuade Benny from going into the Beast's yard to retrieve the autographed ball, but Benny looked at Scotty and said \"I have to,\" whereupon he attempted and succeeded.Don't' we all at some point in our lives have to make the decision to try or to give up? I thought the writers and directors made good use of conflict and resolution throughout the movie from Benny's rescue of Scotty Small's angst from being the nerdy \"new kid\" to the rescue of the Beast from beneath the fence.We all had friends in our youth who are represented in part by the movie's characters. That's why it is and will remain a \"feel good\" movie. It reminds all of us of our own youth and of the good memories we have of those times.",

This movie perfectly captures the spirit of American summertime with baseball being the theme of the movie. Unlike other sports movies which follows a cliche (losers slowly becoming champions), this one is in a class in and of itself. At least one of us can relate to Scotty Smalls story of how he gets to find friends after moving from another town. It's hard at first, but soon he connects with the coolest kids on the block and go on many adventures, many involve swimming in the pool, dealing with some rivals, fireworks, dealing with rivals, a day at the carnival, and the biggest challenge yet to come. The cherry on top? Plenty of messages about what's important in life. I watched this movie many times as a kid and now as an adult, even now, the power of this movie has never lost its touch. You can be an adult and reflect about your summer with friends as you watch this by yourself or with people you know and love. It's a movie to remember forever. One of my favorite movies!",

A time when all a kid needed for fun was a group of friends, a ball and a space to play in.Many of the changes of the past few decades have been wonderful, but I must admit I do miss certain aspects of the past; The Sandlot epitomizes all of them.Do yourself a favor and watch this movie.

It captures the era perfectly of 60s California baseball fever (aside the from the fact it was filmed in Utah lol). The character of Benny was a suprise since he has that 'cool jock' look, but doesn't act like that at all. He doesn't make fun of Scotty (our main character and narrator) because of his lack of athletic ability. Instead, he gives Scotty some simple advice: Have fun. With that (and a pop up from Benny), he is accepted as part of the team. I can mention many moments I like from the film that range from the guys defeating the school team to Squints lusting after his dreamgirl to the final fates of the two main characters (which makes me smile). The small parts of Denis Leary, Karen Allen, and especially, James Earl Jones are nice too. Just a fun film, period.",

            "content": "***POSSIBLE SPOILERS!*** Somebody on this board wondered if there has been anything else said about it that hasn't been said before. To their surprise, I can. I've actually thought of this as a dog-loving movie, as well as a baseball movie or a movie that's nostalgic for baby-boomer childhoods. The only dog-loving move that tops this one is the remake of \"Homeward Bound: The Incredible Journey\" from the same year, but then again, the presence of Sassy also makes this a cat-loving movie.Tom Guiry plays \"Scotty\" Smalls, a somewhat nerdy kid who just moved into a suburb of Los Angeles with his mother and stepfather(Karen Allen and Denis Leary, respectively). His mother isn't so pleased with the idea of Scotty spending so much of his summertime indoors, so she sends him out into the neighborhood hoping he'll make friends. Along the way, he sees these kids playing baseball in some cheap old sandlot. They need another kid, so the leader of this gang, Benjamin Franklin \"The Jet\" Rodriguez invites him over. Most of the kids reject him, but not Benny.The movie show the kid's antics throughout their neighborhood, and surprisingly very few of them are baseball related. Though they do defeat a junior-high team, it's not treated as the big deal most baseball-related movies tend to be. Other antics include Squints' lust for teenage lifeguard Wendy Peffercorn, a huge mishap with chewing tobacco and carnival rides, and most importantly a local junkyard dog on the other side of the fence hyped up as a monster. This dog has a habit of stealing any ball that comes near his yard. After running out of balls, Smalls borrows his step-father's autographed Babe Ruth baseball, and you guessed it; The Beast grabs that one too. From then on, it's an endless montage of failed attempts to get the ball back, until Benny has a dream where he's visited by the ghost of Babe Ruth(Art LaFleur), who encourages him to go take the ball back himself. And once he does, you can be sure that chaos is inevitable throughout the neighborhood.When \"The Beast\" is finally defeated. it's a bittersweet victory, like the sinking of the Bismarck, or the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki. Unlike those three events, there are no casualties, unless you count the death of a local urban legend, which is further solidified when the kids finally confront the dog's owner(James Earl Jones), and explain what they've been doing.Having said all that, it's not without flaws. The flashback scenes where Squints hypes up the legend of The Beast were supposed to take place 20 years earlier, but feature cars made as late as 1966. There's also the issue of how an African-American like Mr. Mertle would've been allowed to play baseball with the greats of 30 years earlier at a time when Major League Baseball was all-white. Nitpicks like this though shouldn't keep anybody from enjoying what can now be called a classic.",

            "content": "Oh... I'm almost afraid to do a review like this because so many people like this movie. But on my integrity as a film reviewer, here I go. Please try to remember that the opinions expressed here are mine and mine alone. If you don't agree with them... so be it.I... do not like this movie. I do not like it at all. I would not have liked it as a kid and I certainly do not like it now. I get why some people like it. If you were a kid when this film came out, or you are just a sucker for cheesy coming-of-age movies, or you just really want a movie like this and you have not watched Stand By Me, I can understand it. I, on the other hand, are none of these things, and I hate this film.It is not cute or sweet or relatable or well-acted or well-paced or smart or funny or clever. Instead, it is clich\u00e9d and crude and energyless and boring and lifeless and limp and pandering. Pretty much everything about this film is pretty much everything I hate about movie. At times, it feels like it was designed to anger me and me alone.Some people have called this film a kid's version of Stand By Me, which is wrong for two reasons. First, it is impossible to have 'a kid's version' of Stand By Me; that movie works because the audience is reliving their childhoods along with the narrator. Making it for kids makes absolutely no sense whatsoever. But I could forgive that except for reason two; all of Stand By Me's energy and realness is nowhere to be found.That movie worked because the characters had real hopes and dreams and highs and lows and flaws. They seemed like real kids; not the corporate movie versions of kids. That movie reminded me how much I hated the kids around me when I was in elementary school. This movie reminds me how much I hated the kids in the movies they made us watch in elementary school. It is as manufactured as films get.The cinematography is terrible. I, someone who has never shot a movie in my whole life, would probably not be that much worse at it than the group who made this film. It is minor grip, yes, but it represents how little effort went into making this movie artistic. There are a few shots of California. That is all. Stand By Me is a gorgeous movie, with its sweeping shots and careful framing. It envelops you and takes you on a journey. This film just stays put.The characters don't go on much of a journey either. Stand By Me was a coming of age film, and an effective one at that. This film tries to do that, but it forgot to actually do the coming of age. Not much changes from the beginning of the film to the end. Don't let the ending monologue and its sweeping music fool you; not much of importance happened during the duration of the film. Even a film like Kiki's Delivery Service, where next to nothing happened plotwise, made the viewer feel like the characters had grown, like the hour and a half that they put into the film were actually worthwhile. This film? I'm terrible at baseball and my time would still be better spent on an actual sandlot.There are so many holes in the plot. What if Smalls didn't drop the ball when he was dropping down from above? You'd be out of the last twenty minutes of the story. Normally, plot holes do not bother me at all, certainly not on a first viewing. But when the world fails to draw you in, everything falls apart; the veil of artistry is lifted.I could go on ranting and raving for way too long. So I'll just issue one last complaint- the characterization is nonexistent. How hard is it to make the characters in a film interesting on at least a banal level; seriously? Make them stereotypes or overgeneralizations; just do something. How trite everything feels could be somewhat excused if you were actually seeing the film through the characters' eyes. But the characters are so two-dimensional that you can't.Overall, everything in the film falls apart. It is as if someone took Stand By Me and hired some random joe to make something like it; and the random joe had no clue why SBM was great in the first place. I will never understand why this movie is so beloved. Nothing stands out; it is bad and boring. Except for the music, which is exceptional.Again, I do not care if you like this movie. Everyone has their own opinion. But I have the right to voice mine. So there it is.",

            "content": "I think I was in grade school when I was introduced to this work of art. Since then, it has become a cult classic in more ways than one. I can find myself quoting this movie so much that sometimes I don't even remember doing it. For those of you who have not seen this movie (and I do mean ever), whether you weren't born when it was made or haven't even heard of it, I highly recommend that you do so. This is a movie that many of us kids who were born in the 80's grew up with and I would recommend it to anyone.It all begins with Scott Smalls, a newcomer in a town in the Southwest. Doesn't have any idea what he's doing, makes a complete idiot out of himself without any help. It is at that point that he comes across one Benjamin Franklin Rodriguez, avid baseball player. Scotty (as he is called by everyone else) is then invited to go to the sandlot to play some baseball with some other boys.Of course, his first game is nothing to write home about. The boys make fun of him and razz him to where he doesn't know if he wants to play anymore. By the second game, he's ready to go. As time wears on, the boys become friends and they start to have some fun. One day comes a rival neighborhood team that invades the sandlot and taunts the boys, exchanging insults at the drop of a hat.Back in the day, \"You play ball like a girl\" was a serious insult because nobody believed that girls could play baseball. Following that heated exchange, the boys then go to the rival team's field and make sport of them without even trying. To celebrate, the boys then go to a carnival...where they make the biggest mistake ever: take chewing tobacco and then go on a fast ride, where they quickly lose the contents of their stomachs.Then comes the biggest pickle to ever come their way: Benny (as he is called) destroys one of their baseballs with a powerful swing of the bat, forcing them to get another ball. Scotty, thinking he's done the right thing, swipes his stepdad's baseball signed by Babe Ruth and then plays with it. Unfortunately, he then hits the ball over the fence of Mr. Merle, to which it became property of the notorious \"Beast.\"True to form, the guys then figure out ways to try and get the ball back, only to fail miserably each time. Having had enough of the madness, Benny engages the Beast in a run around the neighborhood and wins, rewarding them with more baseballs than they know what to do with. Mr. Merle (James Earl Jones) comes out and introduces himself, telling the boys that they could've easily knocked on the door and he would've gotten the ball for them, making Squints the object of ridicule.\"The Great Bambino!\" \"You play ball like a girl.\" And let's not forget the obvious one: \"You're killing me, Smalls!\" I dare anyone say (at least those who are very familiar with this movie) that they don't know these lines. They will stay with you until you remember no more. Watch this gem over and over. Show it to your kids. They may find something that they actually like.",

Sure, it was a bit crass, but that's what happens when one tries chew for the first time.

Certain things were meant to die out, but this film will remain a kid flick forever. From Wendy Peffercorn puckering up to Squints to following your heart, you'll follow this movie right to the end (although it's follow-up wasn't that bad). The planning of the movie is perfect, and it's setting in 1962 sets up the fantasy in all of us. Beating snotty baseball rivals in a pickup baseball game, hitting your first Home Run, learning to throw, making smores, spooky \"camp outs\", the unknown neighbor Mr. Mrtyle \"the meanest old man that ever lived\" that was the perfect summer. Too bad those days are just about wiped out, because those were the days.The classic summer? More like the classic movie.

            "content": "\"The Sandlot\" is a charming kids film that over the last 15 years has gained somewhat of a cult following, making this a nostalgic joy for 25 year old's who remember seeing this at age 10 and laughing their heads off. To me, this is not a perfect family film, but unlike many movies that claim to be family films, this actually is a \"FAMILY FILM\". Kids like it for the relate able situations and amusing dialogue between the kids, adults will find it's very easy to get wrapped up in this, even though it is just a silly kiddie movie and anyone in between will probably enjoy this too.Scotty has just moved to a new neighborhood, and isn't accepted by the other children. Eventually, he begins playing baseball with them at the local sandlot, and several adventures come from this. The main story is Scotty losing his step dad's (Dennis Leary) signed Babe Ruth baseball in the backyard with an evil dog the kids refer to as \"The Beast\".This movie has some genuinely amusing scenes, and some scenes so campy, they're hilarious. One scene involves a young boys plan to make out with the attractive older girl lifeguard at the public pool, and this scene is kind of a classic, which may be seen in movies after or even before this, but it was just done so great here. Any scene involving \"The Beast\" is hilarious. Depending on the scene, this dog changes shape and size, and can be anything from a large dog to some kind of mutated super monster. This dog puts the shark in Jaws to shame. It's good the kids each have their own distinct personalities, and aren't entirely run on stereotypes. One small problem is the lack of any emotional conflict, which may or may not be a problem depending on your point of view. I would have liked something to tug at the audiences' heart strings, but nothing does. It's still a good movie however.Overall, this is a fun movie for all...not great, but good enough to be enjoyed by the whole family.My rating: *** out of ****. 100 mins.

I don't mind the anachronisms, like the guys high-fiving after a victory, 15 years before Dusty Baker and Glen Burke invented it, or Smalls apparently replacing Vin Scully in the broadcast booth. We actually had a sandlot behind our house where all-day games were played and we built a couple tree houses in the eucalyptus trees that surrounded it. It doesn't just remind me of my youth that's gone, but a country as well, where no one locked their house or car doors and the only thing bad that happened in schools were the cafeteria lunches.Being a life long (since the '57 World Series) Henry Aaron fan, I loved that the Babe asked Benny for Hank's rookie Tops card.",

It's kinda 'Stand By Me' but baseball-centered and w/out all that melancholy 'end of era' stuff that permeates that one from '86.Here you have: disparate, recognizably normal type kids playing baseball in the early sixties in southern California, doing normal kid things. You know- bonding, fighting, being scared of the Monster Dog next door, ogling the lifeguard, insulting each other, making things up about themselves that they've never done, trying tobacco, getting sick.The Monster dog turns out to be a rather large, aggressive mastiff, the owner is a blind James Earl Jones, the McGuffin of the Ruth signed baseball the device that brings all of this together.I liked the kids-Smalls, Benny, the Twins, Nunez, Squints, Hamilton esp. I thought their reactions to each other and the world around them to be refreshingly normal. We all did these sorts of things at that age and saw other kids doing them later on. The movie is nostalgic w/out drowning you inside it-the soundtrack does toss in 'Finger Popping Time', a couple of Drifters tunes and Wipeout, but it's all kinda well timed and doesn't feel forced.You get to see Karen Allen and Denis Leary as the parents twice in the movie ala Charlie Brown's adults--which makes sense, really, this is the kids' world, not that of the folks'. I thought both were okay if somewhat under-used.It all wraps up rather entertainingly though you do need to put your mind on hold a bit during the varied Rube Goldberg attempts at getting the ball back(thing pulleys, erector sets, long sticks, vaccuum cleaners, etc) and that marathon chase thru the cinema, fair and what not.Check it out, you will like it and so will your kids. *** outta ****",

            "content": "Sure, this isn't the conventional baseball film. In fact, baseball doesn't really have to be a part of it. This film is about growing up. It's about finding yourself alone in a new town and hoping to make friends. Scotty Smalls (Tom Guiry) is a young boy most of us can identify with. Even if we'll never picture ourselves as Smalls, we can at least say we've met a naive kid like him.Scotty moves to the Valley with his mother and stepdad (Karen Allen and Denis Leary, who are little seen in the film but who are the primary adults here) and plans to spend his summer alone in his room reading and toying with his erector set. When Mom pushes Scotty to go out and make friends, Scotty listens. Reluctantly. He stumbles upon the sandlot one day and finds eight young boys just like him. They never play a real game, just one long never ending practice. These will be his friends for the summer, and one will be there for the rest of his life.Of course, this film works better with baseball. It's America's pastime and one of our country's creations, something the US will forever be associated with. Even if you never grew up playing or even liking baseball, you'll love this movie. There are exceptional performances by our young players, from the portly Hamilton Porter (Patrick Renna) to the handsome Benny Rodriguez (Mike Vitar). These boys aren't ballplayers, they're kids just like we are or once were. We grew up with Squints (Chauncey Leopardi) and Smalls. Like its predecessor \"The Bad News Bears,\" there isn't enough time to flesh out each youngster, but the focus here is on the two main characters, Scotty the narrator and Benny his older and wiser friend.Benny's a big brother to Scotty. He teaches Scotty how to throw and field, gives him a new mitt and cap, and even casually tells his new friend to toss Scotty's trademark puke-colored fish cap into the fireplace. This friendship is the one we all know will last throughout the film.Sure, this isn't \"Field of Dreams\" or \"The Natural\" or even \"Major League,\" but it's an adequate portrayal of growing up in the sixties, having to tell little white lies to fit in, and sticking up for one another whenever possible. In all, there is only one game against an opposing team, a \"real\" ballclub complete with uniforms, stirrups, quality equipment (batting helmets, for one), and a field and scoreboard. This scene is great in that it shows that it doesn't take a lot of $$$ to make a quality ballteam.James Earl Jones makes a memorable cameo in an otherwise \"kid flick.\" The narration is fine (reminiscent of TV's \"The Wonder Years\"), the performances by the young actors promising, and the story/plotline, from beginning to end, is adequate to keep your interest. Most of my friends who have seen this film have said that the most memorable scene is the poolside scene, with lovely actress Marley Shelton portraying Wendy Peppercorn, the object of Squints' affections and resident lifeguard. Though this scene is memorable (in all its possible ways), the true baseball game occurs on the only night game, the Fourth of July game, where the fireworks in the sky light up the sky so much that it's possible to play a game in the sandlot.",

            "review_title": "Steeped in Nostalgia",
            "content": "By the time I got around to watching The Sandlot, I was already in high school. I don't know why that is exactly \u2013 It's considered an early nineties touchstone in much the way Pogs, Game Boys and The Mighty Ducks (1992) were back in the day. By the time it was widely available on VHS, the movie was laser-focused on kids my age. To whit snippet of dialogue like \"you're killing me Smalls,\" had actually managed to sneak into my vocabulary without me even realizing it. So by the time I sat down to watch this ode to summer and eye-fluttering nostalgia, I was already at a point in my life where I was knee-jerkingly against everything that everyone else liked.That is the legacy of The Sandlot that in my mind before setting out for a redemption re-watch. A clich\u00e9d, cloying, and unrelentingly sweet kid's movie that had neither the sense of wonder that E.T. (1982) had nor the propensity to revel in its silliness the way something like The Little Giants (1994) did. To top it off it was about baseball, a sport I had failed miserably in, two years in a row. I even had the distinction of being the only kid on my team to never hit the ball when up to bat. Hearing the collective sighs of parents in the stands and seeing the encroaching outfielders strolling closer as I came to the plate was excruciating.Now that I am older, The Sandlot is more of a silly, good-natured summer movie than a vessel for childhood frustration. It's cute and quotable, liable to give anyone who watches it the same warm feeling when watching A Christmas Story (1983). It's a kid's film from the perspective of kids. Not exactly a rarity but by taking place in 1962, a lack of grounding could've turned out as un-engaging as Newsies (1992).This doesn't stop the film from loading up the plot with a gaggle of stock characters. There's the leader (Vitar), the fat kid (Renna), the ham (Leopardi), the nerd (Gelt) et al. with Tom Guiry rounding out the cast as our fish-out-of-water and de facto narrator. The fact that Sandlot didn't see fit to add \"the girl\" is unfortunate but then Renna's \"you throw like a girl,\" line wouldn't have been as funny and Leopardi's graft at the pool would have actually had consequence.What strikes me the most about The Sandlot the third time around (I think) is it's not really about baseball. In fact, other than a late junkyard dog inspired action boost, the movie basically sits there like a summer heat wave. It's not really about anything other than chasing that feeling of no school, no work. None of the characters really change all that much, and inclusion of James Earl Jones feels like a lesson falling on deaf ears at best. At worst, it's a non-sequitur. If we're honest the only thing holding this thing together are a couple of loosely chronological hijinks.But the hijinks are arguably the best part of the movie and coincidentally what everyone remembers so fondly. The whirlybird scene, the rival team standoff, the extended chase through the neighborhood, it's all so effective in a broad, shameless kind of way. It's during these moments our patience is rewarded with light-hearted, un-cynical entertainment in what otherwise feels like a Skippy's Peanut Butter commercial.Nevertheless, The Sandlot appeal remains hidden under oh so many layers of quaintness. Even a casual observer will notice the camera-work is sloppy, the acting amateurish and the story lacks urgency. If you grew up with it, watching it a second time isn't likely to change your mind on its merits. Since I technically didn't grow up with it, I can't really see anything other than nostalgia propping it up.",

A visit to the local public pool, a challenge from the local snobby kids, and the retrieval of a baseball are typical unexciting sounding events any of us have experienced. However, when you add to the story,\"I remember this one time when me and my friends...\" a flood of emotion and memories are sure to follow.Child actors take note: Whether its good direction, good writing or good acting, this wouldn't have worked if the kids weren't believable.

The story is a about a boy, Smalls, that moves to a new neighborhood and tries to fit in.  It just so happens, that the best way to fit in is to play baseball.  Despite knowing nothing about baseball, Smalls manages to be accepted.  Although the plot is very good, it's the characters that make the movie.  Squints, my favorite, is probably the best character in the movie.  From his over-sized glasses, to his charming ability to put the moves on the local lifeguard, he keeps you laughing through the entire movie.  Other characters include the witty and red-headed Ham, the clueless huge-hat-wearing Smalls and an enormous dog referred to as \"The Beast\".

            "content": "This is easily one of the BEST films of all time. This movie reminded me of when I was a girl playing baseball with the boys in our own sandlot growing up in Alaska. The writing is not only funny but captures what life is like for kids who grow up playing the best game ever, and the measures a kid will take to get out of a pickle.***WARNING: POSSIBLE SPOILERS Every movie seems to have a chase scene, and this movie is no different. When Hercules (aka The Beast) chases Benny through town I nearly wet myself with laughter. I was crying and my sides were killing me. You get caught up in the moment with these guys and their overactive imaginations. The contraptions they make in their attempts to retrieve the ball are genius and goes to show that kids are a lot smarter than adults give them credit for. Their perspective of that dog's just killed me and I thought it was on the money cause when you're a kid, everything looks about 50 times bigger. Even the DOG gets his own P.O.V...i mean, come on. that's PURE GENIUS. I can even remember swapping urban legend stories about kids being eaten by dogs, exploding from eating pop rocks and drinking soda, etc.If you didn't find yourself getting caught up in the moment with these boys, then you have no soul. or never played ball as a kid...either way, it's pretty sad.I recommend a double feature of The Bad News Bears (with Walter Matthau) and The Sandlot. I guarantee that your sides and face will be sore from laughing, and you'll pee just a little.It's in my top 10 of the greatest films of all time.",

Baseball is a big fad with the other neighborhood kids.The new kid doesn't know how to play the sport right, but with luck the leader of the group of the neighborhood kids helped him out and pretty he fit right in with the other kids.But when the new kid accidentally borrowed his step dad's autograph ball of Babe Ruth and went over the fence that holds a boxer dog. The neighborhood kids now have to find a way in getting the ball back.This movie's not too bad to watch. It has it's moments here and there. I recommend it for Ages 8 and up.

The best parts were then they played against the bullies in baseball uniforms, the amusement park scene, and when they retreive the ball that was hit over the fence and into the hands of the feared dog known as 'The Beast'.  And the scene where the kids were all being chased by the dog was a real scene stealer!   I'll admit it is a guilty pleasure movie for me, but it's still a good movie anyway.

That is, until James Earl Jones walks in and steals the movie, but that's a whole other virtue. But all of the comedic elements still retain their value, and it helps that it's in the nostalgic spirit of something like \"A Christmas Story\" (really feels like it should've been narrated by Jean Shepherd).

Because that is exactly what these kids have.  Unlike most other movies, (i.e. \"The Mighty Ducks\") these kids actually care about the game they play.  It is, in fact, their life.  And while it is fun to \"beat the crap\" out of the big tough guys with the fancy uniforms, they just as soon would have played on their own, simply for the sake of playing.  \"The Sandlot\" does a good job of portraying kids as they are: essentially selfish people who love to toot thier own horns, but for the sake of their interests, will tolerate others with similar interests.  Only through this initial toleration do the true friendships begin to form.\"The Sandlot\" is definitely a must see for anyone who has their old mitt lying somewhere in a closet or attic at home, and count on wanting to find it and take it outside to have a catch once you've seen this movie.",

            "content": "Recently, I started carpooling with an old friend of mine and we conversed a lot to/from work. Occasionally, he would say: \"You're killing me, Smalls.\" I let it pass even though I didn't know what he meant by it.I guess after the 3rd or 4th time he said it, I inadvertently repeated that phrase to another coworker in a similar situation as my carpool buddy put me in. They laughed and exclaimed that they loved that movie. I asked \"What movie?\"\"What do you mean, 'What movie?'\" they shot back.I explained I didn't know where that movie line came from, but I somehow knew how it fit into conversation. They laughed and could NOT FOR THE LIFE OF THEM believe I had never seen The Sandlot.Over the course of a few months, I would get the similar response of disdain that I had not seen this movie. In my defense, most of my coworkers are much younger than I and I explained to them that by the time this movie debuted, I was already too old for a young-kids-coming-of-age film. (Later it wouldn't be so bad, but at the age I was in 1993, I wanted to be older and not associate with younger kid movies.)Incidentally, this movie fell off my radar completely during the 1990s and 2000s, until that \"You're killing me, Smalls\" phrase erupted recently. So, I made it my mission to finally see it. (Believe me; I had a minimum of 22 people criticize me for not seeing it.)One recent Sunday night, I finally made time for it\u0085and DAMN. I am SOOO sorry I didn't see it sooner and further, I regretted I wasn't born later, like a decade later. This would've been MY movie. No doubt, I would've seen it a minimum of six times in the theatre \u2013 where I got the money for that many viewings from my poor family, would be the same challenge these boys had with the baseball replacements. But, I would've seen it many, many times. Not that I would've needed to: the famous quotes from it, much like the SMALLS line, would've been permanently engraved into my subconscious from the very first viewing and for the rest of my days.I would've surely identified with Scotty Smalls. Innocent, new, inexperienced and friendless. He moves into a new neighborhood in the early 1960s and takes a bit of time to become part of the gang. Once he does, he's there for life.I am the same way with each stage of my life. Especially with all the moving around my family made us do from the time I was seven until I was almost Junior High School. And then further, outside of school, when I moved from job to job, even when it was years at each employment.I digress. If not for so many movies, TV shows and other life-events in the way, I would probably watch this movie a multiple of times. I absolutely loved this movie, up and down, inside and out. I laughed out loud, cherished the \"PG-Rating/family rating\" which I don't watch too often, identified with the group of kids and reminisced of times, journeys and adventures I had outside and in the neighborhood as a kid.Sadly, I missed both the show: The Wonder Years and the movie: The Sandlot as a child. But, that doesn't mean I have to from here on out.* * * Final thoughts: I don't normally do this, but I want to personally thank my new coworkers and older friends for making me see this classic. I know a lot of other kids my age idolized movies such as The Breakfast Club, The Lost Boys and Stand By Me\u0085I never got into those. I wish I had been born later\u0085 I would've surely idolized this one. So, thanks to you: Jessica Bojorquez, Andy Recinos, Nicole Meglen Davis and of course, Smalls, himself, Brandon Schildts. If I missed anyone, I apologize... Thank you too!",

Scotty Smalls (Tom Guiry) moves to a new neighborhood and wants to learn to play baseball. He befriends a local baseball group and is taken under the wing of Benny Rodriguez (Mike Vitar). The group goes through many adventures together, including dealing with their secluded neighbor's menacing, huge dog.Many kids grow up playing sports like baseball, and go through fun times, thick and thin, with each other. So, this is a nice movie for that younger age group to watch as it delves on the elements of friendship, sportsmanship, and local adventures. The baseball plot may be a little basic in the movie, but throw in a subplot about a mysterious neighbor and his scary dog, it adds some intrigue into the movie.Just about the entire movie has an adolescent atmosphere, so adults may grow out of this movie over time (I wouldn't watch it again even on a slow day). Therefore, this one is best left for the younger viewers.Grade B-",

The schtick with the boys all screeching about the dog and the baseball for 10 -15 minutes could have been cut out to make this a more taut and viewable 90 minute film.

The Sandlot is simply a classic.Being that I spent a good amount of my youth playing sports and particularly baseball outside, The Sandlot holds a special place in my heart. There's something about the relation between the characters in the film and the people who I grew up playing sports with that resonates with me. Luckily, the film holds up extremely well since I first saw it in the 90's. Taking place in the 1960's, the film definitely takes advantage of the history of baseball. Not only is Babe Ruth the MacGuffin of the film, but he ends up making a small cameo (played by Art LaFleur). But it's also fun to hear all of the references to various events to the history of the MLB and other pop culture phenomena. As a baseball lifer, the film still gets quoted in our dugout to this day.Besides having some great cameos by LaFleur and the legendary James Earl Jones, what I love most about the film is the comradery between all of the main cast. They all have their nicknames and unique quirks, which gives the group a broad appeal. But I think we all relate to Smalls, who just wants to make some friends and ends up finding a love for baseball that lasts a lifetime. It's not like a film like The Sandlot deserves a ton of critique. It's a perfect film for what it sets out to be, and that's a fun baseball flick about the power of friendship and how a common interest of baseball can change the summer and life of 9 boys from the same neighborhood forever.+Great cameos+Powerful story of friendship+Perfect baseball flick9.5/10",

            "content": "Written and directed by David M. Evans 'the Sandlot' also known as 'The Sandlot Kids', originally call 'the Boys of Summer' is a 1993 sports comedy that follows the summer misadventures of a group of tweens boys trying to play baseball during the summer of 1962, while also avoiding 'The Beast', a junkyard dog that lives next door to their fence. Without spoiling the movie too much; for the most part, this 20th Century Fox produced film indeed did step up to the plate and hit it out of the park! It was above all entertaining. It has truly gain a huge fan base due to its high nostalgia value. Most of them have given the film, favorable reviews. With some of them comparing the childhood baseball flick to the same heights as author Stephen King's 1986 coming to age masterpiece 'Stand By Me'. It's here where I have to take off my nostalgic googles and point out while, that both films has a lot of similarities, to the point that this movie can be seem as rip off or homage, depending on the person watching. It's still a far cry from director Rob Reiner's film. Yes, I know that both flicks set in the late 1950s/early 1960s, have an amazing soundtrack, follows a group of boys, have a chase scene with a junkyard dog & have adult narrators telling their stories. However, one of the biggest trouble with this comparing is the fact that this movie has hardly a coming to age story. It's not like this racially diverse groups started out as fledgling boys and through a series of trials and hardships, they becomes more mature young men learning to work together, depend segregation. The movie doesn't even deal with that. Nor does the film even bring up much about death or even sex. They is hardly much of adult themes for them to overcome and grow as individuals. Besides Scotty Smalls (Tom Guiry) strain relationship with his stepfather Bill (Denis Leary), most of the team hardly has much of a backstory or journey. Characters don't just don't really developed here. Most of the ragtag team stays the same in the end. Team Captain, Benny Rodriguez (Mike Vitar) maintain the good leader type guy. Michael \"Squints\" Palledorous (Chauncey Leopardi) still really loves Wendy Peffercorn (Marley Shelton) & even the fat kid with the ill named Hamilton \"Ham' Porter (Patrick Renna) is stagnant stereotypical obese. Regardless, the acting from these young actors were top notch. They risk cold and heat to give us the performance of a lifetime. However, I hardly remember some of the other supporting characters like Kenny DeNunez (Brandon Quintin Adams), Alan 'Yeah-Yeah' McClennan (Marty York) and Bertram Weeks (Grant Gelt). They kinda got forgetten over the years. At least, those team members were not as dense & annoying like Timmy (Victor Di Mattia) & Tommy Timmons (Shane Obedzinski), whom are best remember for repeating each other. They were really shallow. Another problem with the film is the main plot comes really late into the movie. Most of the first act is mindless filler unrelated to the sport like the carnival ride and getting to first base swimming pool scene. Regardless those sequences are very enjoyable and funny. So good that they outshine the unrealistic over whimsical, but awesome slow motion 1984 'The Natural' style baseball cinematography & James Earl Jones 1989 'Field of Dreams' like speech moments. Because of that, I can hardly call this movie, a sport film. As for the visual effects like the puppet work, while they look so fake looking and low budget. It's so campy that it's fun to look at. The black and white flashback of the origins of the beast was hilarious. Still, some of the visuals jokes just didn't land for me. The whole array of well build Rube Goldberg items to attempt to get the ball back from the dog's backyard felt something out of silly cartoon rather than something that kids might honestly try. It was too jarring for my taste. What child would waste that much time, resources and money like that? At least, for a PG movie, I glad the filmmakers kept some strong language and colorful insults. It made the dialogue between the characters seem somewhat real even if some of the lines felt like product placement like the narrator stating out how PF Flyers are better than converse cause they guaranteed to make a kid run faster and jump higher. In the end, despite all the flaws, the original movie is way better than the two direct-to video 2005 & 2007 sequels 'the Sandlot 2' and 'The Sandlot: Heading Home'. Both of those films are total swing and a miss. Overall: While, not a perfect game, the 1st movie is truly worth seeing time and time again for repeat viewings. If you haven't watch it. Go see it! This comedy is a slugger.",

While there are some funny moments to be had and the kids interact with one another credibly, the first half of 'The Sandlot' is difficult to get through at times with lots of excessively sentimental voice over narration and several silly shenanigans. The second half of the film is a blast though as a lost ball over a fence brings out the kids' creative sides. The inventions they come up with to retrieve the ball (without disturbing the dog in the yard) are delightfully wacky and inventive, especially a souped-up vacuum cleaner. The second half also features a chase sequence done with unexpected originality (if still the odd heavily telegraphed gag). Suffice it to say, footage from 'The Wolf Man' has rarely been appropriated so well. It has been said that 'The Sandlot' is the type of film that will only appeal to baseball lovers and those who like reminiscing about their youth. It is true that those from these demographics will likely get more from the film, but the project is still probably worth a look for others. The annoying voice-over does disappear for certain stretches and uneven as the first 45 minutes may well be, everything picks up once the kids get to show off their ingenuity.",

            "content": "Summertime nostalgia for the carefree days of yore, when friendship, mischief and baseball was the extent of a young boy's concern. And actually, those first two points are ancillary. Baseball is where it all begins and ends.I didn't grow up in 1960s California like these kids, but their experiences are eerily familiar. As, I'll wager, is the case with most men beyond a certain age. We're products of a day when parents would send their children out, unsupervised, to find their own way in the world until a certain designated supper time. That open sense of freedom, and the alternating feelings of fear and discovery that accompany it, is key to understanding why The Sandlot is so well-loved. Either you lived it and you see it, right there on the screen, or you didn't, and it misses you.It's got shortcomings - lots of shortcomings, actually - but that warm overriding sentimentality smooths over a lot of the rough spots. The effects work on that big, scary junkyard dog might be laughable, but hey, such threats really do seem exaggerated and scary when you're twelve years old. Did the city actually light enough Independence Day fireworks to illuminate the neighborhood baseball diamond for a once-a-year night game? Probably not, but I'll bet it seems that way through the fog of a few decades' unreliable memory.Simple and predictable, with an overdose of \"for the love of the game\" axioms, but also good-natured and playful; it's nice to visit this world, to recall your own similar childhood adventures, even if you can't completely overlook its schmaltzier limitations.",

            "content": "The Sandlot is a great baseball film, even though throughout the film the games take place at a Sandlot and not any major league stadiums *spoiler* until the end of the film with the adult Benny playing for the LA Dodgers.This is a great family film showing the love for America's past time game of Baseball. The film is about a new kid, Scotty Smalls, who moves to a new town where he knows nobody. He follows Benny to the Sandlot, looking to fit in, of course his hopes of fitting in are quickly shattered after an embarrassing attempt to throw the ball back to the infield.However despite the team's disliking of Scotty, Benny decides to convince Scotty to come back and be apart of the team since they are a player short of having a complete team. The result, Scotty becomes more liked by the team as Benny helps him learn how to play.The rest of the film is entertainment and fun from Squints infamous drowning act to the boys first experience with Chewing Tobacco to the final showdown with \"The Beast\".The side story of \"the beast\" is good, a very interesting way of showing why the boys cannot retrieve their baseballs after each is hit into Mr.Mertle's yard. Its something that most kids face, hitting their baseballs into someone else's yard, hearing bad stories about the person that lives in that house and fearing that person. But as Mr.Mertle says in the movie \"Why didn't you just knock on the door? I'da gotten it for ya.\" Which shows that not all people won't be mean and release \"the beast\" on you, some could be a jolly fun spirited person like Mr.Mertle.Oh, and you gotta have that other team that thinks they are better than your team. A showdown of a real team and the Sandlot kids ensues at one point in the movie, just to prove that the Sandlot kids can kick butt even if they are not a real team.The movie was well done, very enjoyable for people of all ages. There should never have been a sequel however fans of this movie are let down. I'd recommend watching this one only and pretend the sequel does not exist cause the sequel is pretty much a remake of this one.",

I still adore this movie.If you didn't play baseball, you know someone who did.  And no matter how old you are, you have to remember the neighborhood Fourth of July barbecue (you know, the one down on the McGuire's front lawn), or swimming, or the neighbor's evil giant dog (oh, do I remember -watch out for Mack).One of the best things about this movie is that is so refreshingly different.  Most movies about younger kids are about them rallying to beat out their competition.  This is about kids being kids.This movie is actually loved by a lot of people.  I can prove it- just walk into a room of high school students, and somewhere in your conversation, start saying, \"Forever . . . forever . . .\" and see how many chime in.All in all, this is not a movie to be missed.  If you ever get the chance, see it; I can't imagine how you could be disappointed.  So, if you ever want a sweet, nostalgic movie, look this one up.",

Some of the events might seem exaggarated and a bit stereotypical but in the end childhood is also about exaggeration and I really enjoyed the way that the narrator tells the story. I think most of the kids will be able to find themselves in one of the boys one way or another and the movie even delivers a decent moral, even when it misses out on more radical plot twists or decisions.All in all I would recommend giving this film a try, especially when you have kids around and want to spend an evening together as a family.

The movie is centered around Smalls who is a kid who has never played baseball before, Benny who is the best player of them all, and Hercules (aka the beast) who is the huge dog that everyone fears that lives behind the sandlot.

It's nothing new or clever, but it is effective when done right.  In this case we have the dog, the imagined history of Mertle's junkyard, the vomit, the 4th of July baseball game, and the concluding chase all have those elements.I won't delve into the acting since it's typical early-90s child acting. This isn't MTV-style, it's Nickelodeon.  There are worse \"family\" films than this, most are more involved with sports--whereas here baseball is just a frame--but this is useful for kids in the meantime.

When pure passion was all that you lived on?This is a movie about those times, and yet, it's something more.  At the age of 10-12, every moment that we live seems like it will last forever, and there is no sense of repercussion for your actions.  In this film, there are times when you want to bury your face in your hands because you can remember something from your own childhood that this film relates to.This film is about that simple time between childhood and adulthood. That time when you believed that shoes could actually make you run faster.  Or that the dog just beyond that next fence was actually a huge monster just waiting to kill you.  Those stories that your friends sat you down and told you about that, in retrospect, you should have known better, but believed anyway, just because you chose to.Scenes in this film bring back memories of a childhood that was once so real, so vivid, and yet, so distant.  While children can relate to this film, because the main characters in the film could be kids that they know, parents can relate to this film as well, because there are situations that we all went through, in one way or another.  The loss of innocence, the connection with our parents on a \"real\" level, the final realization of the vast difference between reality, and that which your friends have sworn is true.As you sit down to watch this film, be prepared to venture back into your own childhood, as that is what this film is really all about.  This film is about each of our childhoods, told through the eyes of the narrator. About the friends that we held dear, and about how we grew together just by being a part of something, together.Oh, and baseball plays a pretty good roll in the film as well.  9 boys who are drawn together by one thing, baseball.  It is through these nine boys that we all find identification.There are some great supporting roles by the likes of Dennis Leary (surprisingly restrained, actually acting even), Karen Allen, and James Earl Jones (who becomes the oracle of baseball, taking in the two kids who will eventually spend the rest of their lives around baseball).This film is one of the many movies that was mismarketed.  This is a film for all ages.  Adults shunned it because it was labeled a \"kids movie\", and kids shunned it because it wasn't a cartoon.  Fact is, this is one of the few films that both parents and kids can sit down and watch together and derive completely different satisfaction from.  This is one of those films that I can't wait to share with my children, when they get old enough to understand it, like maybe 7 or 8.",

Lost ball--careful, there might be a Beast there.  It's funny, sweet, has a great cast, and the plot rocks.  It even has morals.  The best scene, in my opinion, would have to be the face-off between the Sandlot Kids and the preppy rich team (who even have uniforms, jackets, and helmets--not to mention attitude they can't back up on the field and a hatred for out beloved Ham).  This movie is what gave me all my insults AND comebacks! What more could you want?

The acting was great, for these young actors and how they always seem to be getting in to mischief. I love how they bring in the local legend of the \"beast\" who keeps all of the baseballs the guys hit into his yard and how they have to get back a really special baseball that has gone over the \"beast's\" fence. Great storyline and all around great movie that I will definitely watch, again.",

It is an excellent story, clean for kids, and enjoyable for adults. The main character is named Scotty Smalls, who moves to a new neighborhood, and is not very athletic. He quickly meets the guys and receives a less than warm welcome. However, Benny the Jet Rodriguez takes Smalls under his wing, teaches him about baseball and helps Scotty overcome some of his issues. Benny tackles some of his own fears, and the sandlot gang has several crazy adventures. I recommend you go rent it today, even if you have seen it before.",

The Sandlot was one of those films. It's about a group of kids kicking back during the summer. You know, go to the beach, socialize with friends, run away a lot from a vicious dog who likes to eat your baseballs. Yup, good ol' summer. The film itself is sometimes referred to as the groundbreaking kids film of the 90's. But they said the same about a number of films (Casper, Space Jam, The Lion King, Aladdin, etc) but i still think it settles for a timeless cassic title. But two very unoriginal sequels came out, the second being the same as the first except for the girls being in baseball and the thrd is just bad. So the first is way better. The Sandlot 8/10",

            "content": "I hadn't seen the The Sandlot within the last 10 years if not longer. I like revisiting movies that I've gone a long time not watching, because I always forget some parts of the film. I thought it was hilarious the last time I watched it, but then again, I was a kid. The real test is watching a kid-oriented movie as an adult and seeing if you'll laugh. I'm happy to say I enjoyed the whole thing. It's a relatively uncomplicated story, but still manages to have plenty of humor and thought-provoking lessons. It's about 10-year-old Scott Smalls (Tom Guiry). During the summer of 1962, he moves to a new neighborhood in California with his mom and stepfather. He's a nerdy kid who prefers to stay in the house doing engineering type projects. His mom wants him to get out and have adventures before school starts. A kid who's older than him (he looked to be in his early teens) invites him to play baseball. None of the other kids like him. He's terrible at catching the ball. He gets a black eye when his stepfather is teaching him in the backyard. The older kid basically takes him under his wing, and over time his catching skills improve. He also becomes less awkward. There's a ferocious dog on the other side of a fence, so that makes for substantial comedy. It's a funny and endearing movie. Despite having been filmed in 1993, it seems to be (and I say seems because I wasn't around at that time) a realistic portrayal of how kids interacted with one another back then. Coincidentally, I was born the year this movie came out. I watch a lot of vintage TV shows and movies, and this film gets an A+ for accuracy. There is a stomach churning scene - they start throwing up on a carnival ride. Their vomit splatters down on other people. It was really gross, and the burping sound effects didn't help. So I suggest not eating while you watch this.Some people might think this is a guys' movie. I'm a female and I loved it. It's a movie for both sexes. The only thing I can find wrong is how the filmmakers used adult material in a movie that was marketed towards children. There is some ambiguity as to whether or not it can be called family friendly, at least in my opinion anyway. It's actually quite surprising that it's rated PG, considering the dialogue is more on par with a PG-13 rating. There's a few uses of the s-word (which I didn't even remember, so that was new to me). One of the kids who's a catcher attempts to distract a batter from the opposing team by saying he can see his sister standing out in the field naked, and then I think he asked 'do you think she'll go out with me?' I thought that was out of place for a kids' film. The Sandlot is definitely a great movie for teenagers. And kids in middle school, which is 11 to 13. As long as you have consistent talks with your child about manners and boundaries, they should be able to watch a rated PG film that contains some vulgarity without imitating what they see on the screen. It's not an ideal movie for young children, but it's appropriate for 11 and older.",

            "content": "The Sandlot is a clever movie about a boy, Scottie, who moves to a new neighborhood and meets a bunch of new friends on a baseball sandlot. He is really bad at baseball, but Benny, the neighborhood baseball god, takes him under his wing and incorporates him into the group. The team has a bunch of misadventures at a swimming pool and city park, and then things get dicey when Scottie accidentally hits his stepfather's ball, signed by Babe Ruth, into a yard with \"the beast\" a really large dog. There is a bunch of hilarious slapstick as they try to get the ball back.The Sandlot is interesting because it seems to reside in a bunch of genres at once. On the one hand, it is a baseball movie for sure, although something of a satire of movies like Bull Durham and Field of Dreams. You almost get the sense that they have translated the minor league antics of Bull Durham into a kids' movie and the result is really funny. A scene involving chewing tobacco and a park ride is especially effective.On the other hand, The Sandlot is also plainly a kids movie, in the sense that it is a real attempt to see the world from a kid's point of view. In that sense, it owes its conception to movies like To Kill a Mockingbird, which try to see the world through a child's eye so as to illuminate it to grownups.Also, the movie is clearly a nostalgia movie, attempting to recreate in some measure the world of the early 1960s. It is a loving and effective tribute, taking us back to a suburban world of that era which contained a real capacity for joy.Finally, the movie is a physical comedy, and a good one. There are bunch of really funny slapstick scenes in this, mostly inspired by the fantasy aspect of the movie. The world is something of a Calvin and Hobbes sort of world of imagination, and in that world there are plenty of opportunities to laugh at what might be imagined.Thus, the Sandlot is a multi-faceted winner, a movie that appears shallow on the surface but actually works on a bunch of levels. Perhaps most importantly, it is hilarious and fun, and this is perhaps the best reason to see the movie.",

He then stumbles across an old baseball field called the sandlot. Over the next couple of weeks he becomes friends with the neighborhood kids and and get himself into the biggest pickle known to mankind he stole his step dads babe ruth signed baseball and hit it over the fence into the old man's yard where the beast lives and where they have lost over one hundred balls so with the power of teamwork and determination they work together they try to get out of the biggest pickle known to mankind and get that baseball back.\nIn this film the storyline is based in the 1960s and isn't like most baseball movies where there's a bad team that get some kind of magic and wins the championship or something like that, no it's about a group of friends who just like playing baseball, while they make the most of their summer. But as most movies it has plot twist because scottie smalls grabs his step dads babe ruth signed baseball after Hamilton 'Ham' porter the funny big kid who plays catcher on their team hits their last ball over the fence into the beast yard the place of hundreds of lost baseballs. I find that this turn of bad choices is the tipping point of all the funny parts of the movies as for the rest of the movie they try to find different ways to get the ball from the beast and as they say get out of the biggest pickle known to man.\nThroughout this movie you just feel more and more involved in the movie as if you were there that's in part because of the character growth throughout the movie especially scottie small as in the beginning of the movie he not athletic at all he introverted he just likes to stay inside and he has no confidence but as the movie progresses he meets the other sandlot boys like benjamin rodriguez the only really good player of the bunch and all he wants to do is play baseball and of course the one and only Ham porter then the less important characters like yeah yeah and squints and they all grow together after they really didn't want scottie on the baseball team because he was terrible but benjamin insisted on giving him a chance because they needed a ninth player. With the help of benjamin scottie actually become decent and the thing that separates this movie and other movies is it really focuses on character growth and you can tell that they become family in the movie the true friendship everyone wants i have three true friends so i can relate because what would this world be without friends.\nThe sandlot isn't the best movie out their but it definitely deserves to be recognized as a great movie because i've never seen another movie like it. With its storyline and character growth it's just a great movie.",

They also get in the biggest pickle of their lives. Scott has the gang play with a ball from his step dad that was signed by the Great Bambino also known as Babe Ruth. The greatest baseball player that ever lived. As they play with it, it goes into an old mans backyard who owned a mean vicious dog that was a beast of a dog. Of course I think the dog in this movie was a bassit hound. You also know that dogs can't really grow up to be the size of a monster, also they can't grow up to be as big as Clifford. lol. As the gang tries many ways of getting the ball back the beast always gets the best of them. Then Rodriguez had a dream about meeting Babe Ruth and Babe Ruth gives him great advice and that he must get the ball out of that backyard. The next morning Rodriguez goes over the fence and grabs the ball and the beast starts chasing him. When he gets chased back to the sandlot and over the fence again the fence falls onto the beast and is hurt. The kids decide to help the hurt dog and then the dog turns out to be nice. Then the kids knock on Mr. Mertle's door who of course was blind and a retired player of the Negro League. He is played by the great James Earl Jones another fine roll in his career. Scott tells him about the ball and that he was in deep trouble. Then Mr. Mertle gives him another autograph baseball signed by Babe Ruth and all the other 1927 Yankees. When Scott tells his step dad about the ball and shows him the one Mr. Mertle gave him, his step dad only grounds him for a week instead of the rest of his life. Since then he and his step dad became very close. Also the beast also known as Hercules becomes the Sandlot kids mascot and they played ball until they grew up and went on to have different careers. Scott Smalls becomes a baseball announcer and his friend Rodriguez becomes a baseball player for the Yankees. Great film here and still a classic.",

            "content": "I've never been a big fan of sports but I like this movie a lot. This is a film with a lot of heart. It's about a kid named Scottie Smalls who moves into a new town and has a hard time fitting in. He bumps into a group of his peers playing baseball and decides to join them. Through this experience over the summer, he befriends the leader of this group named Benny who has sympathy for him from the start. Smalls also meets an overweight goof-ball (Ham), a dorky kid who has the hots for a lifeguard, and others. At first, they don't like him but as their friendship is put to the test, they all form a bond that has a great payoff.One day, they run out of baseballs and need a new one. Smalls decides to steal his stepfather's ball that was autographed by Babe Ruth. They use it and it goes over the fence where a supposed dangerous dog lives. So the gang decides to find ways to get it back. I won't spoil anything but it's really good.Growing up, a lot of us have had friends like the characters in this movie. It feels authentic and believable. The dialogue is also very quotable. Who can forget \"You're killing me smalls\"? The Sandlot is a classic movie that's great for the whole family!",

So that is my opinion.Mom's opinionThere is a bit of language that you may not want children to repeat but it is a cult favorite. I first saw the movie when I was subbing and it was being shown to a junior high math class. Many of the students (especially boys) were repeating lines.It is a good tween slapstick movie which does touch on the areas of responsibility and friendship. There is also a good anti-tobacco message.",

            "content": "\"The Sandlot\" is a movie about a new kid in town named Scotty who tries to fit in with a group of misfits by learning the game of baseball and playing it with them. At first he sticks out like a sore thumb, but as he begins to develop a knack for the game, he fits right in. Together the group and Scotty enjoy great games of baseball and wonderful misadventures in their small town. Sure, it sounds like a harmless family comedy, but there was nothing funny about it at all, and I sure wouldn't want to put my family through the torture of watching this painfully unfunny movie.There was very little to like in this movie. First of all, \"The Sandlot\" isn't quite the brightest idea in the first place. It's just a bunch of kids playing baseball and getting into trouble. How could that be funny? How could that even be a movie worth watching? I know that when the idea first comes to mind it sounds brilliant, but simply toying with it one realizes that it has no entertainment value at all. Second of all, the actors who portrayed the kids had no experience (and in some cases no talent) with acting whatsoever. I understand that maybe there were not a lot of great child actors back in 1993, but the characters and the actors who played them were trying too hard to portray themselves as dim-witted and silly but strangely likable, and as a result they come off as just plain dumb and unlikeable. James Earl Jones was the only person who did a good job in this movie, but he loses credibility for being in such a disastrous film in the first place. The third thing that makes this such a bad movie was the poorness of the script. All of the jokes fell so flat on their faces that thinking about them now makes me wonder if they were intended to be funny in the first place.\"The Sandlot\" could have been somewhat likable if the script wasn't poorly written and filled with dumb jokes about vomiting on fair rides and rival baseball teams throwing worthless insults at each other, but yet for some strange reason the director and writer went against logic and made the movie as unwatchable as possible.Some of the baseball scenes weren't dreadful, but they were not exactly enjoyable either. It was almost like watching a little league game at times. But, it was a pointless, kind of annoying little league game, with irritating players who weren't as good as they could be. This movie is like taking such excellent family movies as \"Field of Dreams\" and \"Finding Nemo\" and combining them in a blender with such boring and unfunny films as \"The Scout\" and the movie adaptation of \"The Hitchhikers Guide to the Galaxy\", and in the end it all adds up to one huge headache of a family movie. I highly recommend avoiding \"The Sandlot\", for it is a terrible family film and a bad movie altogether. If you feel the need to view this anyway, just be warned that not even the slightly watchable baseball games and the brief appearance by James Earl Jones can save this horrid film from being one of the worst family movies ever made. 2 stars out of 10 is all I can give this appalling film, and yet somehow I feel I'm being extremely generous.",

Benny \"The Jet\" Rodriguez was definitely my first crush. His handsome dark features are outstanding. Even when I watch the movie now I get a weird squishy feeling in my tummy when I see him! This movie is about a bunch of really good friends that have a passion for the sport baseball. Every summer they would go down to an old sandy baseball field that they the named \"The Sandlot\". One summer this new kid moves to the neighborhood and desperately tries to become friends with Benny and the gang. This kid's name is Scotty Smalls or just \"Smalls\". Benny is the only one who is willing to let the poor kid play baseball with them. Benny and Smalls become quite close. Benny teaches Smalls how to play baseball. One day Smalls is up to bat and he hits a baseball signed by Babe Ruth over the wall. The gang knows of \"The Beast\", an enormous and vicious dog. All of the boys are too afraid to just hop over the fence and retrieve the ball, so they begin to try and get the ball from the other side of the wall. The boys come up with some pretty whacky stuff. If you want to know what happens in the end, I sincerely urge you to go to your local Blockbuster and rent a copy of \"The Sandlot\"! Over all rating: 9/10",

But this movie isn't just meant for kids or baseball fans, it is a great movie for everybody because of the messages it was sending us to stand up to our fear. The kids in the movie all stood up to their fear \"The Beast\" in order to retrieve their lost autographed baseball from over the fence. They used teamwork and perseverance to get an opportunity to get the ball, only to come up short of getting the ball. All good movies have some good humor in them, and this movie blends it well with the story. With famous quotes like \"You're killing me Smalls.\" With this quote, this movie is also unforgettable. It's a classic warmhearted movie, that you do not even need to be a fan of baseball to enjoy this movie. It has some funny parts in it but it's mostly about kids bonding in the summer.Teamwork was used by the boys in order to get the lost autographed ball, and to avoid getting attacked by \"The Beast\". When they lost their final baseball over the fence, they got together and started building contraptions. They stayed on one side of the fence to be safe. The Beast was in sight of the ball and they slowly tried to get the ball back. All the boys worked together as a team in order to accomplish their goal.The Sandlot is a great movie for people of all ages.

Actually more specifically it's about growing up in America at that time with baseball, apple pie and fireworks on the fourth of July as constants.If you didn't grow up in either that time or that place then I think that the sense of nostalgia isn't so profound.

A couple weeks ago, I saw it on t.v. and thought it was incredibly boring. Parts were cute, like when the dorky kid pretended to drown so he could kiss the girl, but other than that I was disappointed. I guess some movies are just for kids.Rating when I was 5- 10/10 Rating now- 2/10",

            "content": "I wasn't sure if I ever saw this film before recently, and luckily, my friend invited me over to see it, and I was not disappointed. This film has a lot of things I like to see: Comedy, smart characters, unpredictable things happening, and a great story. I'll get to these aspects of it later though.The story is about some kids who love to hang out, and do many activities, but playing baseball together is their favorite thing to do. They eventually run out of baseballs to use when playing outside once, until one of the kids, played by Tom Guiry, borrows his dad's autographed ball (Babe Ruth signed it) and he ends up hitting it over his neighbor's fence, where they think a huge beast lives, but turns out that it's a dog with quite an appetite. So the kids need to find a way to get the ball back before the dad notices it's gone.What I love most about this film is how unpredictable it is. For example, when the kids are trying to get the ball back, they use a catapult. They try to fling the ball back, and the clip suddenly slows down. I thought the ball wouldn't get over the fence and would be just short. I was wrong. The dog actually jumps really high in the air, and he looks like he swallowed the ball. That was very unexpected and hilarious. I like to see things like that. There's also this one part where one of the kids is able to jump over the fence and get the ball, outrun the dog, and jump over. You think he outsmarted the dog, right? Wrong. The dog then jumps over the fence and starts chasing him. How one can predict this, I have no idea.The energy in this movie is outstanding. Not just from the good acting by the kids, but from the comedy as well. There's this scene when one of the kids pretends to drown so he can make out with the very attractive lifeguard. I knew that was going to happen, but I still laughed hard at it because the energy and timing of that joke.I'll knock the film slightly for two things, and one is that there isn't a lot to the story. Basically, the first half of it is just the kids playing baseball and hanging out, and the second half is them trying to get the ball back. That's all there is to it, but for what we got, I still enjoy it, and this is more of a nitpick. My second problem is that if the kids didn't have enough money to buy baseballs, where did they get all that equipment, like the vacuum or catapult, from? I do see that part of it is child made, like one of them seeing through a box of Wheaties, but it's still impressive technology, and I have no idea where they got it from.For what we got, I really enjoyed The Sandlot, and I am really glad I saw it. I consider it one of my favorite comedies now, and that is quite an accomplishment, since I can be quite picky with films like that. I'd say to go see it, but since it got a sequel, and I guess a third one, I'd assume you already did see it.",

The dog in this movie used to scare the crap out of me when I was little! The dog in this movie kinda reminds me of Cujo The killer dog from the Stephen King novel and movie. just the idea about a killer dog has always sounded creepy to me. And great acting! Great script. Great directing. Great everything. The characters you can actually fall in love with. This movie when I was a kid made me want to play baseball. But I don't play baseball anymore. I love every second of this movie. It could never be out done. A remake should never ever be made. The sequels where horrible and should have never even of been made. I loved every single character in this movie. I loved it when they tried to get there ball back from the dog. The best baseball movie ever made. And one of the greatest movies ever made in the history of the hole entire race of human kind. No joke. No joke at all. I don't know why I haven't bought the DVD of this movie yet?! I think I might still have it on VHS. My mom loves this movie. Everybody does. If you don't like this movie then go jump off of a cliff! An instant 5 out of 5 stars!

            "content": "So many writers and filmmakers have attempted to get the feel of a childhood summer right to varying degrees of success, but not have felt quite as authentic as this one. The pace of the film feels like those languid long days where you go from playing baseball to the swimming pool to making s'mores in a tree house, where time seems to stand still and school is so far off it's barely in your mind.This movie nails it and does so sweetly and with great nostalgia. The kids are all spot on in their acting, something that must have been difficult to wrangle, and it still manages to make me laugh all these years later. I loved sharing it with my kids and they love it as much as I do.",

            "content": "If you ask me, the Sandlot is one of the better sport films that concentrates not only on friendship, but also on teamwork, determination, and believing in yourself. I have seen this movie on many occasions, and it never fails to amaze me. The kids shown in this movie are just what they should be; not sugar-coated, obnoxious, whiny or arrogant. The movie is family-friendly, and not in a bad way either.The setting takes place in the early 1960s. A kid named Scotty Smalls moves into a new neighborhood and soon gets involved with a group of baseball buddies in some hilarious, memorable moments. Throughout the movie, he narrates how he got into the biggest pickle, and how it was one of the biggest summers of his early life. Benny Rodriguez, the neighborhood hero, accepts him into the Sandlot, and he soon learns of the sport of baseball. Then, he hears the tale of 'The Beast', who the kids fear that he might eat them and take their beloved sport away. At first, Smalls doesn't believe the story, but soon realizes that he fears 'The Beast' just as much as they do. In a string of hilarious scenes, the boys will do anything to save their pals and the Sandlot.A turning point in the movie is when Smalls takes his stepfather's autographed Babe Ruth baseball to continue on with the game. After he whacks the ball into the yard of 'The Beast', he soon fears that the ball may be history. The boys devise a plan to bring the ball back, even if it means being inside the territory of 'The Beast'.Because I don't want to spoil too much, the movie in itself is one that you'll come back for again and again. It captures that childhood innocence almost perfectly, and it contains that feeling that is rarely felt in other childhood films. Anyone who grew up in Southern California during the 1950s and 1960s should feel right at home when they watch this film. Even though the film wasn't actually filmed there, it still depicts the era in which it was cast.The Sandlot also reminds us of the days when kids would play outside during the long summer days, before the world became indulged in video games, text messaging, and surfing the Web. The actors in here all give a solid performance, at the very least above average. They aren't really well known, but just as with everything else, not all famous actors are good and not all child actors are bad. To make a long story short, the Sandlot is a well made film that will entertain kids and adults alike.Despite seeing the movie several times, I still enjoy it for what it is. Although it's not perfect (what movie is?), I highly recommend this movie for those nostalgic of simpler times and those obsessed with baseball.8 out of 10.",

            "content": "A group of boys experience a lifetime of lessons in one average American summer. In The Sandlot, Scotty Smalls (Tom Guiry) makes friends with the neighborhood boys and they embark on juvenile adventures of camping out overnight in their clubhouse sharing s'mores and urban legends. The youths enjoy the thrill of the amusement park and the bittersweet effects of chewing tobacco. The nine strapping young men take a right of passage when they face the over exaggerated myth of a mammoth dog dubbed 'the Beast' to retrieve a baseball signed by Babe Ruth. I interpret the intent of this film to promote Americanism. In 1993, patriotism was rampant. We loved our country and this film gives us a multitude of images to tug at our red white and blue heartstrings. The only thing more American than baseball in The Sandlot is the various ethnic groups represented by this politically correct version of The Little Rascals. Although their skin colors run the range of hues, they all live the same American life in their Converse sneakers and crew cuts. In the aftermath of our invasion of the smaller, weaker nation of Kuwait, these boys' foreign and domestic relations help us redeem our souls and reclaim our image of a kinder, gentler nation. We see subtle use of commercial icons representing middle class life in the 1960s. On the counter of Scott's mother's (Karen Allen) dream kitchen, we see the Pillsbury Doughboy cookie jar and Post Sugar Crisp cereal. A perfect metaphor for the sweet, sweet life the American family experienced post World War II and powerful propaganda to recreate it Post Gulf War. Picnics and celebrations boast our American pride with fireworks and red white and blue decorations hung from every available limb, front porch awning and lamppost. We witness the young boys conquer their fear of being devoured by the massive dog Hercules to retrieve the ball signed by Babe Ruth. Is this Director David Evans' way of suggesting that Americanism, represented here by the ball signed by the Great Bambino is worth the risk of life and limb?",

It is such a simple plot but it has powerful meaning. It is very realistic and it doesn't try to hard to be funny, it just is naturally funny.Scottie Smalls is the new kid in town who is very smart but a bit awkward. A kid named Benny asks him to start playing baseball with him and his friends. The other kids don't like him at first since he is a little geeky, but he eventually is accepted by the group once he learns to play baseball. Benny tells him that it is not too hard. Scottie now has new friends and begins to have an action packed summer with them,like having camp outs, fearing the beast behind the fence, going to the pool, talking about Babe Ruth, and of course playing baseball. Scottie also gets them in \"one of the biggest pickles ever.\"It's a great kids movie, very funny, and quotable. 9 out of 10",

There's an awful lot of screaming in the film...I'm sure this was supposed to be funny, but it REALLY gets on the nerves after a while.  And while I'm at it....What is blue blazes was an excellent actor like James Earl Jones doing in this movie?  You're supposed to believe that this man was a baseball player who played with Babe Ruth. But of course, there's the problem of the fact that the league wasn't integrated at that point.  Maybe they made Jones' character blind so he wouldn't have to look at nauseatingly trite dialogue...I know I was wishing for a fastball to come knock out my lights so I wouldn't have to sit through the rest of this.

If you're an adult, it will bring back fond memories of childhood that will make you wistful to go back to those days again.I first saw this movie on HBO when I was a kid and found it to be a pretty entertaining/funny movie with some animated characters and an amusing sub-plot about a killer dog. It was fun for what it was. But I have to say, I think the adult audience has the bigger end of the stick here. Re-watching it as an adult brings a perspective to it that most kids are too young to grasp: experience and time. This film romanticizes childhood and does a pretty damn good job of it, too. You will be hard-pressed to not find yourself thinking about how you were at that age and remembering old friends that you probably haven't seen or heard from in many years. This film stirred up so many memories I had forgotten and even made me quite sad.This movie and \"Stand By Me\" are probably two of the greatest movies about adolescence you can watch. The feelings and emotions are timeless and representative of a time in our lives that is gone way too soon but never forgotten.If you're having a hard time or maybe even just a bad day, put this film on and go back to the days when everything was much simpler, the biggest problem in life was what to do on a Saturday afternoon, and your friends were the most important thing in the world. If only we could capture these memories in a bottle and relive them any time we wanted. But since we can't, this film will have to do.",
