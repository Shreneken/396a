            "content": "\"Scarface\" was a great operatic film rooted in Greek tragedy, primarily the downfall of its protagonist related to his own hubris and pride. Its over-the-top theatrics and scenery-chewing acting complemented the absurdist tone of the film; some carping critics complained it was \"too violent,\" but it was silly violence...and it worked.\"Carlito's Way\" is considered by many to be a companion piece of sorts to \"Scarface\" - but in its own ways it is vastly different. As \"GoodFellas\" differed a great deal from \"Casino\" in its narrative methods, \"Carlito's Way\" isn't as broad and theatrical as \"Scarface.\" Of course, it's still a DePalma film, and that means we get some beautiful set pieces - but for the most part DePalma avoids his excessive visuals and instead opts for a balanced mixture of both storyline and directorial flair. It is not a sequel to \"Scarface\" - it is an expansion, and it seems entirely apt that its narrative is more mature, considering that Carlito Brigante (the main character) is wiser than Tony Montana from \"Scarface.\" Carlito is a Puerto Rican ex-con who gets out of a thirty-year jail sentence based on a technicality after serving a mere five years of sentence. Faced with a new life and fresh horizons, he decides to heed the lessons he learned in jail and embark on a new and honest lifestyle.\"Scarface\" was Greek tragedy insofar as Tony Montana was doomed to a downfall based on his own egotism and stubbornness. Like Oedipus in Sophocles' classic story, Montana was too bull-headed to take the advice of his wife and friends and was entirely responsible for his own emotional (and, in \"Scarface's\" case, physical) demise.\"Carlito's Way\" is the flip side of the coin. It's still Greek tragedy, but it offers a new perspective. This time, the protagonist tries to change his fate, but his life is doomed to its inevitable conclusion. Carlito tries to change his ways, but - to paraphrase a character from another film - there is only one guarantee...Carlito Brigante will never see heaven. That's the fundamental truth of this movie, and DePalma's less showy camera-work, and the more mature characterizations by the actors, and the believable script, ensure that \"Carlito's Way\" is an entirely human experience - far more so than \"Scarface.\" (Which is still a great film based on its own goals.)",

            "content": "I was thoroughly impressed with Carlito's Way. So far it is my favourite Brian De Palma film alongside Carrie and The Untouchables. De Palma's direction itself is terrific, while some of the set pieces such as the pool fight, the 15-minute subway chase and the shenanigans on the train-station escalator are among the best in any De Palma film.The cinematography is excellent, the lighting is used in an interesting way and the scenery and locations are striking. In short, the film looks good. The soundtrack drives the film very well too, the script is smart and funny and the story is ceaselessly compelling. The pace is spot on, and the acting is very good. Al Pacino gives a suitably restrained performance which was a refreshing change from his excessive performance in Scarface, while the supporting cast have plenty of time to enjoy themselves.In conclusion, a fine film. 10/10 Bethany Cox",

This film is probubly the best crime story ive seen, next to Goodfellas(1990), Pacino gives another superb performance as well as the rest of the cast.  The story in Carlito's Way is extremely compelling and can be very sad at times. Unlike Pacino's similar film Scarface(1983), Carlito's Way is not just a blood bath without much of a story.  I dont know why this film fizzled at the box office and failed to recieve any academy award nominations because it sure deserved to.  9 out of 10.",

            "review_title": "They pull Al Pacino back in again in this film as well",
            "content": "The tragedy of Al Pacino's character Carlo Brigante is that after his shortened stretch in the joint he realizes there is a life out there beyond his gangster world and the mean streets of East Harlem. But Pacino only finds that out way too late. And like that other iconic Pacino character Michael Corleone he gets sucked right back in. In retrospect Pacino should have had a ticket for Florida waiting for him the New York minute he got out of prison.This would be a film totally dominated by Al Pacino had it not also been for the incredible performance of Sean Penn. If in fact Penn took the role only for the bread he certainly gave the movie-going public its money's worth when they paid to see Carlito's Way. I'm surprised that he was not given Oscar consideration.When a lot of money comes to Pacino and I won't reveal how, he buys into a nightclub with the intention of earning just enough money to set himself up in business in Florida. But in his way Pacino is a man of honor. He does owe his lawyer Penn big time. Penn in fact found a loop hole as good lawyers do and got Pacino sprung from a long rap. So when Penn asks for a favor, Pacino has to oblige.Penn is fascinated by the life the criminals he defends lead. The easy access to money and power and women have turned him into a pleasure maddened hedonist. Some other criminals he's been the attorney for Penn has not behaved honorably to put it mildly. He asks Pacino to help him cover up that fact though Pacino does not realize it at first. It's part of the undoing of both of them. The other part is the dismissive way he treats an up and coming gangster John Leguizamo. Think of Gregory Peck and how he treats Skip Homeier. in The Gunfighter.Penelope Ann Miller is a young dancer who is fascinated by Carlo Brigante and is drawn to him. For the audience she embodies us and our fascination. For Pacino she represents the good life he aspires to.In character development Carlo Brigante most resembles another of Pacino's iconic parts, that of Tony Montana. But classic film fans will recognize a strong resemblance to one of Humphrey Bogart's gangster roles in The Big Shot. If it were not for what Sean Penn gives us in Carlito's Way this would be strictly a personal Pacino work. Their scenes together in Carlito's Way are unforgettable.",

            "content": "Great movie..and I can see why it is underrated...possibly due to obvious comparisons to Scarface (Brian De Palma, Martin Bregman, Al Pacino team), which was much more brutal in its approach.Al Pacino as Carlito, awesome as he is, is still much softer compared to the sledgehammer Tony Montana. And then there is some romance mixed in with the story of a gangster trying to reform himself.I didn't like the romantic scenes myself...thought they interrupted the flow of the story...hence I gave it a 9 instead of a 10! There is also some clich\u00e9d dialogue. I happen to be a big Pacino fan and so I am being a little bit (though not entirely) biased and am sidelining all these things. If you excuse these small potatoes, this one is a great flick from start to finish, very entertaining, with some fantastic performances from the supporting cast, e.g. Sean Penn. Special mention, also, of Viggo Mortensen who comes in for a short role, but plays the part wonderfully.As for Al Pacino in lead role, he makes sure he steals the show, as usual. Brilliant!",

Pacino delivers an excellent performance (do you really expect any less from him?) as the main guy Carlito who just wants out of the whole gangster game. By his side is the almost unrecognisable Sean Penn. An afro wearing cocaine addict who just seems determined to lure Carlito back into the kind of world he is trying to leave.This film is easy to enjoy with a great story and a great cast. And if you look carefully enough you can see a young Viggo Mortensen (Aragorn from lord of the rings in case you don't know) as a crippled low life. Made me chuckle.Anyways, i give this movie 10/10",

            "content": "\"I've dropped myself into straightforward character pieces in order to explore that form and reap its values. But you are sort of restricted visually when your first requirement is to tell a fairly straightforward story. So I'd like to go back and develop pure visual storytelling. Because to me, it's one of the most exciting aspects of making movies and almost a lost art at this point.\" - Brian De PalmaThere's a scene in Brian De Palma's \"Carlito's Way\" in which Al Pacino stands outside his lover's door, watching as she slowly undresses. Pacino pants like a dog in heat, salivating over the beauty of her naked body. Unable to contain himself he breaks the door down and lunges for his woman, their lips locking as he embraces her soft flesh. De Palma's camera then giddily circles the couple, \"You Are So Beautiful\" blazing on the soundtrack. The moment of passion escalates, the camera circling faster and faster, their feverish kisses becoming more wet, more sloppy, until she looks into Pacino's eyes and says: \"Where's my cheesecake?\"It is with moments like these that director Brian De Palma acknowledges that \"Carlito's Way\" is one giant slice of cheese. This is art for art's sake, a purely formal exercise in which De Palma indulges his fetish for sexy aesthetics. He pushes every motion and emotion to operatic proportions, ringing every ounce of drama from what is really a fairly generic plot. With its impeccable compositions, precise camera work, glacial tracking shots, baroque tone, sublime action sequences and flamboyant acting, this is a film in love with its own form. But for a film so preoccupied with surfaces, it's remarkable how much emotion De Palma wrings out of his cast. De Palma has a fondness for bad actors, often deliberately casting them as props or undermining their performances. Indeed, his leading men (Michael J Fox, Josh Hartnett, John Travolta etc) are often clueless actors who themselves play clueless characters, and his leading women (Melanie Griffith, Scarlett Johansson, Rebecca Romjin, Nancy Allen etc) are often models or vacuous pretty faces who likewise play airheads, hookers or prostitutes. This is a guy preoccupied with surface beauty, even as his films are explicitly preoccupied with the dirty veneer behind such surfaces (\"Redacted\", for example, is about the lie behind beautifully composed photographs). And even when De Palma does cast genuine talent (Pacino, Penn, Lithgow) he has them play larger than life characters, their raging opera performances designed to match his shamelessly grandiose vision.In \"Carlito's Way\" De Palma has Al Pacino play Carlito Brigante, an ageing gangster who has recently been released from jail. Carlito is determined to go straight, staying out of trouble until he can amass enough money to retire to some paradisaical tropic island. It's a generic plot, but Pacino and De Palma mesh so perfectly that the film eventually transcends its B movie premise and becomes, at times, something a bit more sublime. Odd for a gangster movie, \"Way\" aligns itself firmly with the world of noir. Gangster movies typically follow a fairly obvious narrative progression. We get rise, the good times, and the fall, the bad times. \"Carlito's Way\" is odd in that it treats the fall as a forgone conclusion, its dying protagonist narrating his death dream like Fred MacMurray in \"Double Indemnity\". This is a conspiratorial world, Carlito pulled around like a puppet on a string by some unseen, cosmic noir God. Indeed, upon being released from jail, every action Carlito does, every choice he makes, is righteous and admirable. And yet noir fatalism thwarts him at every turn, his choices unable to halt an almost predetermined finale. And so the \"Way\" of the film's title refers both to Carlito's spiritual path, his newfound desire to be good and do right, but also something more inexorable; the \"way\", the fixed route. Rehabilitated or not, Carlito's tragedy is that there was never any chance of escape.And so while in \"Scarface\" Pacino's manic performance gelled perfectly with De Palma's cocaine inspired direction, in \"Carlito's Way\" his forlorn eyes mesh flawlessly with De Palma's melancholic visuals. At 53 years of age, Pacino's face has never looked this beautifully tragic. Framed by a jet black beard, Pacino walks about like Jesus on a good hair day, suffering for sins he can not atone. Already dead, he spends the film always dressed in black, navigating his death dream like a fallen angel. Watch too how Pacino spends the film alternating between a stance of fast-talking macho posturing and one of melancholic regret. He wears the face of a corpse, of defeat and acceptance, his flashes of confidence a hip old mask which doesn't know if its going or staying.And yet in death Carlito does receive a spiritual redemption of sorts. He may not have escaped his past, but he does help his lover, a stripper who dreams of being a ballerina, escape hers. And so when De Palma chooses to end the film with another airing of \"You Are So Beautiful\", we know that the song has a dual function. We celebrates Carlito's newfound spiritual beauty, but also the aesthetic beauty of De Palma's filmic world.8.5/10 - Stylish. De Palma's one of the few directors able to convey a sense of true three dimensional space. His crane shots are gorgeous, and the film is composed of numerous long takes, elegant whip pans, and zooms so precise that we switch from long shots to close ups almost imperceptibly. Worth multiple viewings.",

            "content": "Al Pacino, Sean Penn, and Penelope Ann Miller create an artistic and romantic twist to the gangster genre in Carlito's way, story of a convicted gangster by the name of Carlito Brigante, known to his ex-lover as Charlie, who manages to get his way out of jail thanks to crooked drug-addicted lawyer David Kleinfield. After his release, he's convinced himself that he's never going back to his life of crime, but before he knows it, he's inevitably being pulled back thanks to his corrupt friends and family.While Scareface centered around the action and grittiness of the gangster life more then anything else, Carlito's Way tends to lean to the romantic side, giving the film an artsy twist. For example, in one scene there is a close up shot of a revolver, the chamber slowly moving to an empty slot. There is another famous scene with Carlito inside of a dark bathroom, his back against a wall with a pistol in hand. The way the camera is placed, the way Carlito is standing, and the way the lighting reflects off of the wall and his leather jacket are all taken in to account by De Palma. To make a long story short, Carlito's Way is very beautiful, and this is all thanks to De Palma. He directs the movie very well, you can tell that he put some true dedication in to this film.Needless to say, the acting is incredible, no matter what you might be hearing. Al Pacino is as always great, and Penelope Ann Miller is as well. But most of the time you'll find yourself deeper inside Sean Penn's character then Pacino's or anyone else's. He's steals nearly every scene he's in, if not then he steals all of them. He's almost too convincing.The scores are very, very strong and add on to the artistic feel to the movie. Not only do they add on to that, but it adds to the tension, the romance, and the tears as well.To sum it all up, Carlito's Way is the best gangster film ever made. I love it more and more every time I think about it.*****/*****Riveting.",

Immediately, I was drawn into the film. By the time the credits rolled by, I knew I had just witnessed the greatest film I had ever seen.What makes \"Carlito's Way\" such a great film is the fact that even though you know what is going to happen at the end, the movie makes you want to know how this character, Carlito Brigante, ends up where he does.  And what a ride it is.Al Pacino is simply astonishing as Carlito Brigante, a reformed criminal who wants nothing more than to leave his old life behind and start anew.  Sean Penn proves once again that he is one of the most effective actors working today in a role that not only sees him keeping pace with Pacino, but should have netted him a Best Supporting Actor Oscar.  John Leguizamo and Viggo Mortensen also deliver solid performances.\"Carlito's Way\" is filled with scene after incredible scene, and line after incredible line; all of which lead up to one of the greatest finales in motion picture history.  If you haven't seen it yet, run out and rent it immediately.  This is the film that turned me into a movie lover.  Sure, I have seen better films since then (not many, mind you), but \"Carlito's Way\" will forever remain my all time favourite.",

            "review_title": "Al Pacino's best film performance post-1990!",
            "content": "CARLITO'S WAY (1993) is the real best Al Pacino performance after 1990. Love him in his Oscar-winning role in SCENT OF A WOMAN (1992); it's not as overrated as people say and he is infectiously good in that. But in CARLITO'S WAY, Mr. Pacino plays the more difficult role of Carlito Brigante, who deserves as much respect as Michael Corleone or Tony Montana! I've got to preface the rest of my review by saying that I've seen this film a bunch of times, starting with right after it first came out in the early 90s and have loved it ever since. It is one of those films that has EVERYTHING in it that will appeal to anyone. You like Action? CHECK...Romance? CHECK...Drama? CHECK...Thrills? CHECK...Humor? CHECK...This is one of the rare films that has it all!The legendary Pacino seemed to specialize in playing ambitious, crafty, respected gangsters and Carlito is no exception in those general aspects; but in this film, Carlito is in large parts different from both Corleone or Montana; whereas both Corleone and Montana were very powerful men that controlled empire throughout the bulk of their films, Carlito WAS a powerful gangster who lost his empire and did jail time; also, Corleone and Montana were inherently suspicious and possessive men to the point of being paranoid, and dare I say it, inherently evil; whereas Carlito was justifiably suspicious, but also ironically forgiving and accepting of other people's shortcomings and at his core, a GOOD man! The other 2 men chose to live a certain way and either never tried to redeem himself (Corleone) or never had a chance (Montana), but Carlito has lived the hard, gangster lifestyle, paid for his sins, and now wants redemption and to start anew. From the moment the film starts in 1975 with his courtroom speech (the only pure comic moment in the film) \"thanking\" the judge for releasing him early from his 30-year prison sentence (he only served 5 years) to the very end, the viewer HAS to root for Carlito Brigante! Carlito, upon release, wants to start a whole knew life and become legitimate. No more drug-dealing, no more killings. He wants to play it straight. Carlito's lawyer that gets him off is Dave Kleinfeld (played by the great Sean Penn in a superb performance), a shady man who is hooked on drugs and has his own troubles as he has stolen money from one of his other imprisoned gangster clients, who finds out about it and blackmails Kleinfeld into helping break him out of prison. This is definitely one of my favorite Sean Penn performances and ironically in a supporting role. He's effortless as this scuzzy, posing, pathetic, out-of-his-league lawyer and in a way, his tale is as tragic as Carlito's.The film's first ironic moment occurs when Carlito's young cousin gets him into a scrape with some low-level drug dealers in a crappy gin-joint/pool hall, where Carlito must use his old school cunning and instincts to survive. His cousin had $30,000 to make the deal for the drugs, but the dealers were going to kill him and keep the drugs and money for themselves. Carlito can't save his inexperienced cousin, but outsmarts the dealers and gets away with the money. He uses that money to buy into a partnership with disco-owner Sasso. At this point, he sees a dancer one night that reminds him of his old girlfriend Gail (Penelope Ann Miller in a sexy, sweet performance). He seeks out Gail one night after her dance class and they go to a diner to talk about their past and possible future. Honestly, I think that \"beauty\" is an overrated word and there are even actresses that are (supposedly) beautiful in real life that don't do it for me on screen, but Miller as Gail totally does it for me! Gail is a REAL woman, who, like Carlito has goals, ambitions, desires and they complement each other perfectly. Gail is sexy in a very natural way.Things look good for Carlito, but feeling he must help Dave out of his scrape, he goes along with him the night of the prison escape on a boat with the gangster's son and Dave kills the son against Carlito's wishes. Carlito cleans his hands of Dave. But there is another up and coming gangster Benny Blanco (John Leguiziamo in a wonderful performance) that has an unhealthy admiration for Carlito and won't leave him alone. So Carlito finds himself surrounded by all these shady types that he can't shake. He decides to run away with Gail, who is pregnant.Directed by the great Brian DePalma, CARLITO'S WAY is a very authentic period piece as he captures the essence of the 1970s without the film bogging itself down in that time period. The focus is on the characters and the story, but has an epic feel with a lot of long-view tracking shots, an operatic score, and Pacino's brilliant narration of his characters thoughts and emotions. The cinematography is amongst the best I've ever seen in a modern film. All these elements perfectly complement the bombastic personality, yet contemplative nature of Carlito Brigante. I don't know if I've ever seen a film where virtually all non-human elements of the film reminded TOTALLY of it's main character! Another thing...this film is almost 2 and 1/2 hours long and is NEVER boring! That's an incredible feat in and of itself.Great supporting work is also provided by Luis Guzman (as Carlito's right hand man Pachanga), James Rebhorn (as the D.A. out to nail Kleinfeld), Paul Mazursky (as the judge who freed Carlito), and my favorite one played by Viggo Mortensen (as the wheelchair-bound Lalin, an old associate of Carlito's).But in the end, this film is ALL Mr. Pacino's, who effortlessly essays the title character and gets some of the most quotable dialogue in the gangster genre of film. A top 10 film of the 1990s!",

            "content": "What makes conventions apart (not essential, but always there, like mildew in a shower) of the studio system of movies, as well as in the industry year in and year out, is that they set up the basic track lines for the viewer, to which then he or she can see if the re-treaded storyline will be more impressive than the last movie to take a convention to use.  Brian De Palma makes one of his best (and under-rated) films by letting the viewer be as self-aware of the on-coming chiches and pit-falls of the drama the story intones, just by the narration.  The aged, contemplative voice of Carlito Brigante (Al Pacino) that chimes in more often than not, is as essential to the way the story unfolds as Henry Hill's was to GoodFellas- this guys been on the inside, he knows the ropes, he knows the stakes, he knows the nature of the beast that goes with the people he associates with, and now that he's out of prison, he doesn't want it anymore.  Un-like a lesser film, we start to believe his intentions and reasonings.Carlito's just been released, thanks in part to his counselor David Kleinfeld (Sean Penn), five years gone in a thirty year sentence, and when he returns to the street many look at him as if he's changed hearing that he's retired.  Carlito just wants to get some money together, open a car dealership of sorts with a friend in the Bahamas, and works in a nightclub right smack dab in the heart of the coked up late 70's.  As Carlito's tale unfolds, so does Kleinfeld's, as an inmate who's a client of his makes a demand that he can't turn down, which in turn brings a perpetually reluctant Carlito along with him.  Another wise decision on De Palma's part was the casting: Pacino's screen presence is sometimes enough to be intimidating, but his performance as Carlito is the part of the heart of the movie (the other part is with Penelope Ann Miller as his estranged girlfriend), compelling, tough, and intelligent from years of dope dealing and soaking up the gang-land atmosphere around him.  Personally, I would put this over Tony Montana any day, if only because the accent rings truer as do his emotions.  Then there's Sean Penn as Kleinfeld, a scheming, vain little man who starts off seemingly as legitimate as a lawyer of criminals, but as we soon learn, he has slipped into a world that he has no place to belong in.  When I first saw little sections of this movie on TV, previous to recently watching it all the way through, I really didn't know who it was playing Kleinfeld, with his balding, curly hair and nervy, cranked voice appearing like it was Sean Penn, only as Woody Allen if he were ever an attorney.  However, when the viewer looks into his eyes, both terrified and ravenous, one can understand the pathway to excess that most conventional crime movies take for granted. \nIncluding supporting work by Penelope Ann Miller and John Leguizamo as the convincing critter Benny from the Bronx, and magnificent set-pieces that confirm De Palma's worth as a director of thrillers as well as dramas, this is an example of Hollywood movie-making that is waiting to be discovered over and over again, as proof of the value that can come in re-fashioning a genre piece.",

Just like it's \"brother\", Scarface, the movie gives us an insight of a criminal world, with all it's cruelty, deceit, lies and fatal decisions which can change ones life forever. As we observe the last days of a retired gangster Carlito Brigante, it's hard not to admire skills of the director, as a quite usual story of a good guy trying to quit \"the business\" turns into an epic and a cult movie right in front of our eyes. The movie also contains some important messages, and one of the most important is: \"Never give up your friends, no matter what...\" The movie has excellent cast (Pacino is great as usual, and Sean Penn does an amazing job as a repulsive corrupted lawyer) directing and soundtrack. 10/10, a true crime classics.",

Combined with great performances from Sean Penn and Penelope Ann Miller, this film is a roller-coaster ride of \"will he, won't he\" tension and heavy , though not gratuitous, violence.So swept away do we get in Carlito's struggle that we actually forget that he's dying at the beginning of the film, and are praying that he'll make it by the end.

            "content": "This has to be one of the most unfairly underrated film in movie history. It's a perfect film, and much better than any other De Palma film (I am a big fan of De Palma but this film is just perfect). Ex-drug dealer Carlito Brigante, recently released from prison, tries to live a decent live while dealing with the ever present temptations of going back to it's old one (mostly from his friends, who aren't very happy with the idea of Carlito becoming a decent citizen). He is always accompanied by his best friend and lawyer David Kleinfeld, who is a coke addicted and increasingly paranoid lawyer with dubious connections in the mob world. As you can see, with friends like these it would be a hard job for Carlito to abandon his old life. However he finds strength and inspiration to continue his efforts of cleaning his act by reuniting with his old love (from before he went to jail) Gail. This story is a perfect thriller whose structure and development feels a lot like a Greek tragedy reinterpreted as a film noir. There are few action sequences, but the dialog is so perfect that you just want to know more and more about the characters. The few action sequences are beautifully filmed, and i assure you: you will not be disappointed, they will keep you on the edge of your seat. The performances are great, Pacino gives a great Humphrey Bogart-like performance as the ex-con always tormented by his past (the narration is also great, it clearly shows us how Carlito is feeling, and how i think an ex-con would think trying to clean his act with temptations in every corner). Sean Penn gives an academy award worthy performance by giving a believable approach to Carlito's increasingly drug addicted, paranoid and even homicidal lawyer. The beautiful Penelope Ann Miller gives us a wonderful performance as Carlito's only positive influence and inspiration in his life (I think this performance should have established her as strong leading lady, but as i said, this movie doesn't have even half of the recognition it deserves). All in all, Is a great movie, and personally, one of my all time favorites (if not favorite). Great Performances, Perfect Film.",

            "content": "Most people don't highlight 'Carlito's Way' among Al Pacino's gangster movies, but in my opinion it's an instant classic. It's not as hyped as 'The Godfather' or 'Scarface', but it's an extremely honest and captivating film, that wins you over exactly because it doesn't seem to have been created to make it into film history.All the characters are very well defined, so there are no ambiguous or contradicting behaviors. Al Pacino is extremely charismatic, convincing the viewer that as well as he can play an Italian or a cuban, he can play a puerto-rican. And his complete change from one character to another is what makes this movie so special among the other great gangster movies.Carlito Brigante is a more mature gangster, reformed from his years spent in jail. Differently from Tony Montana, Carlito doesn't feel, or needs to feel isolated. He reaches out to the people around him. He wants to trust, and mainly, love. Gail, his love interest, is put on a pedestal, as the person with whom he wants to escape to 'paradise', and the entire film revolves around the expectations and the hope that the viewer feels for this romance that along with Carlito's way out of the crime world would lead them both to the dream life. If Michael Corleone's essence was in honor and Tony Montana's in money, Carlito Brigante's is in this sensitivity, that make's you forget about his ethnicity or his background, which isn't so in 'Scarface'. His body language and his looks as a Latin-American also change amazingly compared to Tony Montana.The supporting actors were also amazing, mainly Sean Penn, that really embraced his character, Kleinfeld, a stressed-out, corrupt lawyer, who betrays everyone around him. John Leguizamo is also great as 'Benny from the Bronx'.Overall the film is very well paced, as it begins with a bit of action, when Carlito returns to his neighbourhood, goes on revolving around him getting his life back on track and making plans with Gail, and ends with the thrilling and greatly edited scenes of the Grand Central Station chase. Finally, when he's shot, you're left wondering if there was any way out to begin with, and if there's really a possibility of 'paradise', even for a reformed gangster like himself.",

He is truly trying to remain clean and to make some rather honest money in a club, though he gets the necessary investment from a bad deal that had cost the life of a few people. He was only an asset to a younger dealer, a recommendation, a referee if you want, aired and exhibited by the younger one. But that younger one was dealing with young gangsters and of course they tricked him into dying, losing his money and getting nothing, except that Carlito puts things right, to his own and sole benefit. But he has to deal with a vast Italian family in his club and outside. The main twist in the plot is that the lawyer who rescued him out of prison had been dealing with these gangsters, and this family in particular, even trapping one in prison after appropriating the million dollars this particular gangster had made in his business. But a lawyer will always be an amateur gangster and he drags Carlito into the last act of his own drama. That will cost their lives to the lawyer, Carlito and half a dozen members of the family in the brilliant setting of Grand Central Station. At the very moment when he could have walked out of this life of outcast crime, he is reminded that the leash that is attached around his neck will never disappear. This film has some depth somewhere about the great ease with which honest people can become dishonest, and at times with the idea that they are not dishonest since the people they steal or rob are thieves themselves. The code of the street is all powerful and definitely stronger than any law imaginable. The film is brilliant too as an action film, even, this time with suspense and great actors, Al Pacino being doubled up by Sean Penn.

            "content": "'Carlito's Way' is another fantastic example of a film chronicling the rise 'and rise' and fall of a petty gangster. This time there's a bit of a twist in the initial narrative as the gangster anti-hero is attempting to 're-rise' the hierarchy, albeit briefly for cash purposes, upon being released form prison.I really and genuinely liked Carlito's Way. I thought it was funny, well paced, contained likable/dislikeable characters to whom you could really get stuck into as a viewer and just generally held its own for two hours. What I really liked about the film was the use of mise-en-scene; particularly the use of setting and lighting. It seemed that different shades and tones were used for different scenes and moods. The colour red was used to distinguish danger and warnings where as other, lighter colours acted as relief. Examples can be when the colour red was used in the club scenes. Confrontation is always a possibility with eventual party-pooper 'Benny from the Bronx' when the club is the setting and this continuous threat acted nicely with the lighting, just as the red lighting in the strip club when Carlito sees his love interest working there, it has a sort of 'shock factor' to it as he feels confrontation with his own emotions and probably a little bit of a heart broken feeling, also.Whenever this red light crops up in the film, Carlito is facing danger and/or conflict with himself or others and it is threatening his American dream of moving to the Caribbean. Thus, the lighting signals where and when he'll have is conflicts along his journey to a retirement of some sort.The feel the film has to it is also very realistic. When Carlito is involved in an early shoot out in a bar, he is taking cover in the toilets and is genuinely concerned about the dangers that lie in the bar area waiting for him and although he doesn't realise he's already done the business, he treats the situation like it's critical; issuing threats, buying time and trying to think up a plan of escape even though there's no need.Al Pacino really pushes home his character in this film. We see the two sides of Carlito at numerous, well paced times and it's a real treat. The reformed, kind hearted Carlito is blended in very well with the once violent, ruthless, professional Carlito that ultimately got him into prison in the first place. This reminds us that there are two sides to him and alters our opinion on him throughout. The violent distractions that frustratingly pop up for Carlito act as a mental subplot in the film and they really add to the character and to the experience of the film.This is well directed, well thought out and well acted. The action scenes, shootouts, dialogue driven scenes and love interest scenes are all blended in very well and make for a superb, gritty action-crime drama.",

            "content": "Inevitably, Carlito's Way will always be compared to Scarface. Same director, same star, same genre; it is difficult to watch this film without thinking of Scarface. This is very unfortunate for Carlito's Way as it is second rate compared to Scarface but it is a very good film and many people have failed to see this.Where Scarface was about a South American battling his way to the top of the crime world, Carlito's Way is about a South American gangster trying to leave his past behind him. The story is very good and believable, the problems for Carlito (Al Pacino) are very typical for someone in his position and the relationships are all very convincing. The fact that Edwin Torres based his characters on real people and that events in the film are inspired by real life, really help Carlito's Way to be a credible film. The fact that it is Carlito's lawyer, Kleinfeld (Sean Penn), who got him out of prison and then becomes a loose cannon who provides Carlito with too many problems is a great illustration of respect and excess going to someone's head.The performances in this film are extremely strong. Al Pacino is one of the best actors ever to be witnessed and is on outstanding form here. The beard, shades and long coat are a very good look for him and definitely provide him with one of his most fashionable roles to date. What is most convincing in this performance is his charm towards Gail (Penelope Ann Miller) as the audience, along with Gail, fall for him instantly, despite knowing his past. His scenes with Sean Penn are also amongst the films strong points because it always good to see Pacino act angry. The dialogue between these two is exceptional and really highlights how strongly Carlito's Way is written. Sean Penn does not let Pacino outclass him and gives one of his strongest performances. As an arrogant coke head, Penn portrays a character who is really repulsive and dislikeable and incites a great sense of hatred from the audience. Penelope Ann Miller does well to give the film feeling and bring it down to earth. It is pleasurable to watch her inner conflicts regarding Carlito as she pulls off the emotional scenes very professionally and is very effective at drawing out an emotional response from the audience. Luis Guzman and John Leguizamo are the two most memorable characters from the supporting cast, they both fit specific niches very well and both give great performances. It was nice to see Adrian Pasdar in the film, shame he wasn't in it for longer as the writers could have made something more out of his character.My only negative criticism of the film is that it could have done with a touch more action. Gangster films are at their most exciting when there is a high drama shootout but Carlio's Way only has two major action scenes. Luckily, the content is good enough to make up for this. The two shootouts are very good scenes, especially the last one as the tension build up is so intense.Stylish, realistic and stimulating, Carlito's Way would be a classic gangster film, had it not been overshadowed and over compared to Scarface. All the ingredients are right to serve up a fantastic film.",

            "content": "Carlito's Way (1993), is a brilliant cinematic work. Pacino's performance as Carlito Berganzi displays the duplicity and subsequent torment between his reformed spirit, and the endless seduction of the street, embodied more specifically as his reputation,legacy,those who know him, of him, and those whom he allows in his innermost circle. Sean Penn is phenomenal as the lawyer representing Carlito, his metamorphosis into character is testament to his depth of talent. Penelope Ann Miller, as the long-suffering love of Carlito's life is dramatically and visually enchanting. The casting is perfect. The supporting cast superb, perfectly augmenting the film. The script is alive with literary devices, the story line(s), characters, dialogue, themes, sub-texts,etc., make this an almost endlessly watchable film. Of this genre, Its all there, action, suspense, violence, confrontations, chases,  prerequisite street and wise guy character profiling with the right dialogue to make it work. Directed, executed and rendered a cinema great. Carlito's Way is atypical of the gangster genre, although it adheres to certain basics. It is also  a love story, not boy meets girl, ad nauseum, but real, destined soul mates, wrenched apart and thrown back together five years later by some abberation of fate. As one experiences spiritual,moral disintegration, the other the anti-thesis. Carlito's Way is a mix of genre's veiled with diligent artistic discretion. I even see certain thematic similarities to Casablanca. Watching Carlito's Way I had the feeling that De Palma wanted to resurrect and redeem poor old Tony Montana, Scarface (1983). Perhaps it was self-redemption, or a means to a great film with a second view or maybe the fun of bringing back that great ensemble of talent, based on a similar theme. A sequel of sorts, not to diminish either film in anyway. Released exactly ten years after Scarface, the comparisons are more than obvious. Ten years later, De Palma and Pacino. Oliver Stone missing, but another great script. In Carlito's Way, Pacino again plays a Hispanic drug lord. Now Puerto Rican in New York City, before Cuban in Miami. Now drug lord repentant, whereas in Scarface, drug lord vehemently unrepentant and devoid of remorse, from beginning to surrealistic end. Instead of classic gangster genre prerequisites employed in Scarface, such as, coming from the bottom, rising in status, trust and favour in the eyes of the mob boss, eventually killing him, and gaining his empire his woman(Michelle Pfeiffer). Love? Its not in the equation- Carlito only wants to unite with his TRUE LOVE. To redeem himself in her eyes, after causing her the heartbreak of losing him forever.(Which it would have been, if not for the quirk of intervention by Carlito's coke addicted, sociopathic lawyer). Carlito seeks solely to prove to his love that he is truly changed, honest, sincere, and even has a plan whereupon they can live happily ever after. Carlito and his girl are likeable. Upon viewing this film one is compelled to empathy, wanting them to escape insurmountable odds (the almost onmniprescent serpent-like \"street\"), finding and deserving of happiness as long as they may live. However, it is though The Angel of Death has been hidden somewhere in every frame of De Palma's film, casting a shadow, waiting patiently to put his hand upon...Even the ancillary characters from Scarface are brought back in legions for Carlito's Way. Carlito's Way is Scarface with \"feelings\". Which is another similarity in the two films, \"feelings\" is the Achille's Heel of both Carlito Berganzi and Tony Montana. I also believe both films were vastly underrated and overlooked by the mainstream media, but upon populist vote, they are both widely esteemed as \"classic\". I'd give Carlito's Way (1993) nine out of ten. If I saw a ten, it would be a life changing event.",

Sean Penn is Kleinfeld, the lawyer who gets him out of the slams after only five years on a thirty-year sentence. Penelope Ann Miller is Gail, the old girl friend Carlito takes up with again after his return to the city.Pacino used to be a big drug dealer and, having learned some things about life, is now ready to retire, with the intention of taking his cut of some money from the club he partly owns and flying off to the Bahamas or someplace with Miller, there to open a car dealership. He wants out of a city in which everyone now seems more corrupt than before he went upstate, a city in which \"honor\" has become an almost meaningless word, useful only in coercing help from someone else, merely an instrument.\"You owe me,\" says Penn. And Pacino, honor bound, must do favor after favor for the weaselly, duplicitous, coke-snorting lawyer including, finally, involvement in the murder of a Mafia member and his son. Penn does the killings. Pacino didn't even know about Penn's plans, but the mob holds him equally responsible.And while he is running his club and figuring out the details of his escape to the Bahamas, Pacino is forced to enact the role of a man so unyielding and unforgiving that he must brush off brash youngsters who would like nothing more than to take his place in the city's underworld.It's a complicated world that Pacino inhabits. He needs to juggle too many goals. At the end, he is betrayed by his best friend and brought down, just as he is about to board the train for Florida. I once heard a lecture in anthropology on Hispanic fatalism and thought at the time it was just another cooked-up thematic generalization. But subsequent experience has made me wonder. This film, including Pacino's narrative voice over, could have been written and directed by that anthropologist, . (Or by my fatalistic barber, Luisito, for that matter.) The acting is fine all around, with not a sour note. The direction is equally competent. No show-off directorial adventitions. Everything looks just about right, from Carlito's wardrobe (black leather coat) to the interior of his night club with its neon distractions. Penelope Ann Miller, in a dramatic role, is to die for, or at least to dance with. When this movie was made, Pacino could still run like hell, just as he did in \"Serpico.\" Actually, the direction is fine, aimed at an adult audience. There is a shoot out at the end, almost obligatory by now, but it's preceded by a super-tense game of hide-and-seek in Grand Central Station, with four mob guys darting around and looking for Pacino, who is doing his best to get to Miller and the train. A less mature execution would have involved dozens of guys with Uzis and thousands of bullets and exploding glass windows and naked women taking showers and cars blowing up in fireballs and Niagras of blood and berserk speeding trains and endangered baby carriages and little old lady by-standers and murdered clowns -- and it all would have been carried out in slow motion. The director has done such things before. Not here. The fact that the story can generate so much suspense and excitement with a minimum of gore is a tribute to the people who put this together.",

            "content": "The actors in this film are outstanding, from Pacino & Sean Penn to Penelope Ann Miller & an early John Leguizamo this film sports an outstanding cast. Brian De Palma is also in fine form here as he directs this movie seemingly without effort and with his usual unique (these days) style. The film is a seen as a sequel of sorts to Scarface, but saying that does Carlito's Way an injustice. Carlito's Way stands apart and on it's own very well. The world in this film is fascinating to behold, a bit of mob, a character wanting to reform, a love story and an action story. Also Pacino has a lot of nice sayings in this film. If Scarface is a 10 then Carlito's Way should be a 9. This film has been too underrated for far too long, it's time justice was done which is why I gave it the deserving 9 stars.

Pacino plays Carlito Brigante, a Puerto-Rican ex con who tries to stay away from the things that put him in jail, the drugs and violence of mafia life. Pacino is great in this role, loved his cool and suave aged acting, he really played this role well. Sean Penn was also good to see as his lawyer, David Kleinfeld. This film is great, one of the best of the early 90s, great atmosphere by de palma, nice script by David Koepp (jurassic park), and nice acting by pacino as well as supporting performances by Sean Penn, John Leguizamo and Luis Guzman, who were all great. Penelope Ann Miller was not bad, although not too powerful performance by her. The film is one of my favorites, a must-see for any pacino fan, or fan of the mafia genre. 10/10 #26 on my list of all-time favorite films.",

            "content": "Brian de Palma scores once again with another gangster epic. Despite having a number of flaws, CARLITO'S WAY is still a very good film, chronicling as it does so the life of Al Pacino's gangster as he is released from prison and determined to go straight. But we've all heard that before... Okay, so this film is behind SCARFACE, which was one of the best gangster films ever, but for the '90s it's very good and stands up on its own amongst all the junk filling the shelves these days. De Palma adds in all his trademark homages to Hitchcock (especially in the last twenty minutes) and stylistic touches which make this film interesting and sometimes exciting to watch.Where it falls apart somewhat is in the dialogue scenes, especially in the added romance between Pacino and Penelope Ann Miller. The film's running time does feel excessive (2 hours 19 minutes) and a lot of these scenes are dragged out. Miller is miscast as Pacino's love interest, because she just isn't a very convincing actress. Thankfully these stodgy moments only account for a quarter of the film. For the rest of the time we're back in familiar territory. The cast is populated by seedy villains (John Leguizamo is a standout as a creep), and it's Sean Penn who really excels in an unrecognisable role as Pacino's crooked lawyer, a cokehead to boot. Penn is very good here, a real character you love to hate.Obviously, though, it's Pacino who stands head and shoulders above the rest of the cast, and he doesn't disappoint either. He portrays a character who is out of touch with the modern world, a romantic who is sometimes crooked, sometimes violent, but infinitely likable. The violent content to the film has been toned down a lot since SCARFACE, but there are still a couple of bloody moments to behold from de Palma's gory, glory days including a wince-inducing shot to the face. Where this film really excels is in the final twenty minutes, a lengthy chase scene. This sequence is taught, tense and totally thrilling, and easily the best part of the entire film.Okay, so there are numerous flaws; the voice-over seems unnecessary and intrusive, as if De Palma had watched GOODFELLAS one too many times, the whodunit aspect of the ending is easily guessable, and the running time is far too long and needs judicious trimming. But despite these factors, CARLITO'S WAY is still a cut above the rest, and prime viewing for gangster fans.",

I remember the first time I watched Carlito's Way, aged 18, as one of the most cathartic experiences in my life. At the end, I was choking with emotion, my eyes were welling with tears and my trembling hands instinctively rose in the air and clapped, as I shouted \"Bravo!\", even if the rest of the auditorium were already grabbing their coats as if they had just watched any old movie. The infinite beauty of this romantic tragedy had left me gobsmacked and I just wanted to stay there and sit through the whole thing again, straight away. For weeks afterwards I became obsessed with the world of Carlito Brigante, with Al Pacino, with Brian De Palma (I also saw Scarface in that period, and it instantly became another of my all-time favourites). I had already loved movies before, but Carlito's Way cemented my love for cinema forever and made it into a passion. And ever after I saw Carlito's Way, I have been going to the cinema as often as I can, driven by the hope that another film will come along that can make me feel the same \"high\" as that unforgettable day. A handful have achieved it (Shawshank, Seven, 12 Monkeys, Cidade de Deus...), but Carlito will always stay in my mind as the film that discovered me the overwhelming power of what a roll of 35 mm celluloid tape can do to the human soul.",

The ending is very sad and \"satisfying\" at once. It's one of the best endings I have ever seen!Pacino gives a great performance as Carlito Brigante who wants to start a new life and try to get his big love back after he has served 5 years in prison and had a life full of crime, drugs and murder. He wants to open a car-rental business and needs money to start it. But he can't get out of the vicious circle of his old friends! The real star of the movie is Sean Penn, who gives an Oscar worthy performance as Brigantes perfidious lawyer David Kleinfeld. I must say all of the actors gave a great performance, especially Penelope Ann Miller as Gail! The cinematography is very well done. Especially the scene when he is in the bathroom, after his cousin gets killed and he shoots the 3 guys at the pool-table (which also is the DVD-cover)! Then, of course the magnificent ending/opening shot and another good example is the chase in the station! Overall I think this movie should get more attention because it is a masterpiece which shows Pacino in one of his strongest roles and DePalma at his best!!

What makes this film excellent is that all the pieces of the puzzle come together beautifully, great intense acting from Pacino, excellent directing and an excellent screenplay. To me, this was another 'Scarface'(different level of gangster), with one exception, that being the intensity of the character. We see Carlito now has plans for his life and is a thought out person in contrast to the crazy, uncontrollable and unsustainable Tony Montana he portrayed in Scarface. It's suspense all the way, and Sean Penn serves as a finishing touch as his faithful 'save your own ass' kind of guy. At just over 2hrs in length, this film kept me wanting more. The ending, is of course tragic and well defined but yet makes you feel so sorry for Carlito, after coming so close to reaching his ultimate dream of paradise, he was found short by the one thing he respected, that was friendship. Any Pacino fan out there, this is a MUST for their collection, along with 'Scarface' and 'Scent of a woman'.",

            "content": "Brian De Palma and Martin Bregman, the guys who were responsible for the gangster classic \"Scarface\" had scored another classic with \"Carlito's Way\". Based on a novel by Edwin Torres, the screenplay adaptation, who incredibly was about to be turned down by Bregman, is one of the best crime movies of the 90's or perhaps of all time.I was always curious about this movie and waited over 10 years to see it. I finally decided to just buy the DVD, and let me tell you it was the best twelve bucks i've ever spent in my life. I was not disappointed one bit.Al Pacino gives an Oscar-worthy performance as Carlito Brigante, a Puerto Rican hustler from the 70's who has just served five years in prison and has vowed to live a clean life and stay away from crime, but finds it very difficult to stay out of the streets and out of trouble once he gets back to the old neighborhood and meets up with his old acquaintances, and little by little finds himself going back to the same life that put him behind bars in the first place. Sean Penn gives another Oscar-worthy performance as Brigante's lawyer and friend David Kleinfeld, who is very much involved in Brigante's world of crime in his own way and is way crazier and reckless than he looks. Penelope Ann Miller is great and very sexy as Pacino's love interest Gail. The rest of the supporting cast is excellent as well: Luis Guzman, as Carlito's right hand man Pachanga, the then-unknown Viggo Mortensen, in a short appearance as Carlito's acquaintance, Lalin, and of course one of the most memorable characters, John Leguizamo as a drug-dealer with high ambitions, \"Benny Blanco from The Bronx\". This movie is filled with great dialogue and even greater performances and is one of those movies that usually critics pound but that audiences love for generations. The movie's soundtrack is great as well, the disco hits and the salsa music perfectly fit the mood of every scene and truly take you back to that time. This is by far one of Pacino's best movies in his career and he should've definitely at least been nominated for an Oscar. Definitely worth to be in your collection if you're a fan of crime dramas or gangster flicks. 10 out of 10.",

That's dePalma.DePalma's films divide into those he directs `for hire' and those that spring from his own mind. This is a `for hire' project.It still has dePalma's energetic eye: in the framing shots at the beginning and end; in some exhilarating floating sequences at the club; and at the chase up and down the escalators toward the end. This latter would be developed in `Snake Eyes,' a `pure' dePalma project. When we are in the opportunistic eye, this is magic.The problem is in the acting. No, I'm not saying the acting is bad. But when studio bosses assemble these things, often they don't understand the chemistry involved among the various beings certain actors carry with them.Pacino is a sledgehammer. He's not clever, just loud. Among actors, he is a gangster so it is apt that he plays them. But Sean Penn is a Brando-type being: he projects several personalities at once: always including at least one shadow of the character and himself as actor. It is a whole different way of constructing a story. The story might have been able to accommodate both styles: actually some good films do exploit these differences, but always to the advantage of the clever actor. `Untouchables' had a writer that knew how to negotiate these risks.DePalma was constrained, and couldn't synthesize the parts. So he parses the film into three bits: his own art of perception; Penn's creation of projection, and Pacino's noise. By turns, he allows each one some attention as if we were at a three-ring circus. The result is incoherent.Ted's Evaluation -- 2 of 4: Has some interesting elements.",

Though many political reasons played into that. And while it did not get the immediate recognition back when it was released, it has quite the after life.

The big difference is that in Carlito's Way we aren't seeing a vain attempt to cash in on the success of a popular film series, which really is all The Godfather III ever was.Al Pacino was on fine form in the title role, but is probably outshone by Sean Penn as the coke-addict lawyer, David Kleinfeld, who was almost certainly the inspiration for Ken Rosenberg in Grand Theft Auto: Vice City, which of course is directly connected by the involvement of Luis Guzman in both titles - as Pachanga in Carlito's Way and as the voice of Ricardo Diaz in GTA: Vice City.Also it's good to see Viggo Mortensen in a role so vastly different to those he played in Lord of the Rings, Hidalgo or even GI Jane.

The thing that surprised me about Carlito's Way was it's heart. Amidst it's action and drama, and gory scenes and foul language was some real emotion...a love story...a man determined to turn his life around but doesn't quite get to escape it all because of one wrong choice. Brilliantly cast, and brilliantly directed Carlito's Way is like an epic journey of this man's life. We are shown what he used to be through the eyes of those around him while we are shown the way he wants to be right now after being released from prison on a technicality. In essence De Palma shows us two completely different sides of the same man in the same picture...that's brilliance.What can you say about Al Pacino?? Does he truly ever do wrong?? Not in this film. His portrayal as the wanna-be changed Puerto Rican Drug Runner Carlito Brigante is brilliant...an iconic film character. He's a complete anti-hero by definition because he's the furthest thing from a hero but you truly want him to succeed in escaping his past and living life out with his girl. Pacino is such a versatile actor and this role gives him the range to show us every emotion possible. He is perfect for the role. Sean Penn (not one of my favorite actors) does a very good job in a barely recognizable role as Carlito's slimy, underworld attorney David Kleinfeld who Carlito feels great loyalty to as one of his only friends and for helping him get released from prison. Penn truly is slimy as Kleinfeld and you are in the position that everyone else in the film is in...you don't understand Carlito's loyalty to him that ultimately leads to his downfall. Penelope Ann Miller is the love of Brigante's life that he returns to and convinces her to leave with him and escape the life of crime. Miller and Pacino do have great chemistry together and even their sex scene is quite steamy and well filmed. Miller's role comes across as a little whiny and needy but perhaps that is the character. John Leguizamo plays a small but very vital role in the film as a local hood that runs drugs the same as Carlito did and idolizes Carlito until he gets the cold shoulder. Leguizamo is appropriately sleazy and bad and great for this role.Certainly shot with a gritty and nasty appearance of New York's underside. Shot from key locations including Grand Central Station the film is riveting and easily one of the great films of the nineties if not severely under appreciated. The film was based on a series of books and De Palma could have easily made it feel like we were missing a history of this man but you never feel that way. Instead you feel like you get to know him through the other people, and dealers and old friends and compare it to the new Carlito, desperate to escape. This is an absolute must see for fans of Pacino, De Palma or Crime drama in general. It's an absolute classic!! 8.5/10",

            "content": "Carlito's Way (1993) **** (out of 4) Marvelous thriller has Al Pacino playing Carlito Brigante, a former drug dealer who gets released from prison and plans on going straight. Once out on the streets he plans to raise enough money to get away but it doesn't take long because the crime in the streets begin to find him and it doesn't help that his lawyer/friend (Sean Penn) gets himself in trouble with a crime family. It seems shortly after this movie was released to great reviews, the earlier Pacino/DePalma flick SCARFACE started to build its reputation as a cult favorite and sadly this 1993 masterpiece has pretty much been forgotten since, which is a real shame because it's clearly the best of the two movies. DePalma has certainly lost his way in recent years so it's probably hard for some to remember that at one time he was one of the greatest directors working and CARLITO'S WAY features some of his best touches and the performances by the entire cast is what makes this film so memorable. It goes without saying but Pacino was born to play a role like this. His Puerto Rican accent is top-notch and I really love the way the actor plays the part so laid back. This laid back nature comes across as experience with the character knowing the street laws and the way Pacino brings this across is very memorable. I'm not sure how long he had to practice or if it just came natural but the way he walks it's as if he just glides from scene to scene. As terrific as Pacino is the movie clearly belongs to Sean Penn who gives one of his greatest performance and I think it's easy to look back and say that this is where he greatness really started and took off. The sleazy character is so perfectly captured by Penn that you can't imagine any other actor doing the part. Penn has to go through a wide range of emotions from scared, to trying to be tough and to an eventual killer but he's believable every second. The scenes with him high on coke and slowly losing his mind are perfectly done. Penelope Ann Miller does a great job as the love interest and we get strong support from John Leguizamo, Luis Guzman and Viggo Mortensen in a small role. A lot of thrillers get bogged down with silly love stories but that's not the case here because the love story actually makes you feel even more for Carlito and you want to see him succeed and get away from his crime life. It certainly helps that Pacino and Miller have so much great chemistry together and this comes raging through during a love scene that DePalma perfectly directs to Joe Cocker's \"You Are So Beautiful\". You'll notice the camera quickly spinning around the two, which will have fans of the director thinking back to the prom scene in CARRIE where the same camera trick was done. The movie features one great scene after another but the highlight is an eleven-minute chase sequence at the end of the film, which has to be one of the greatest in film history. There are other DePalma movies that I enjoy more but I can't think of a greater sequence than the chase through Grand Central Station as it contains drama that just keeps mounting and mounting to the rather shocking conclusion. The blaring music, terrific camera moves and the way the story plays out is just pure magic. CARLITO'S WAY is a rather remarkable little thriller that clocks in just under two-and-a-half hours but there's not a dry moment to be found.",

He finds himself going back to his ways; it is like the gangster inside him jumps out from time to time. It's not one of the mafia type of movies. I'd say this one is different, it tells the story of a guy who wants to leave his old ways back and to lead a normal life.This film is a live living world, you can feel everything from the characters to the strip clubs. Carlito since coming out of the prison now hangs around with his lawyer cokehead friend, Kleinfeld, who attracts trouble wherever he goes.The film is very well made. I can already tell that the director had a very solid screenplay and dialogue writing because everything seems to fit right into place - beside some gunfight sequences, but this is not some mafia movie so it gets a pass - and show you how a movie can be a made with something so simple yet so captivating.The runtime of the film is perfect for this film, it is neither too long nor too short.

The action is still there in part, but Carlito's Way is a much more grounded and reflective film than Scarface - there are no 70 men gun fights, and Brigante manages to restrict himself to far fewer than the 500000000 odd F words that are spouted from Montanas lips.Although, nothing will ever top Scarface for me, this was deffinetly a worthwhile project and it goes down as one of my faverout films.

By Pacino that never lets us down in any of his performances. We have Sean Penn in a great part as Kleinfeld as he falls down the path of corruption that we hardly recognize him with big bald frizzy hair. Also some performances by Luis Guzman, John Lequizamo & Viggo Mortensen in some their first parts. Guzman now get lots of the best supporting parts their are. Leguizamo is a great comedian & serious actor with a career already. And Mortensen, that is one the best actors around.Directed by Brian de Palma (\"Carrie\"), this is one of the most realistic, and historic accurate pictures of life in New York City's urban jungle during the late 1970's/early 1980's. Brian De Palma had just come off a lukewarm reception for yet another Hitchcock homage, \"Raising Cain\" and was in need of a hit to appease the studios. And so, a re-teaming with Al Pacino in an effort to recreate the magic of \"Scarface\" made commercial sense. \"Carlito's Way\" was much more sombre in tone than the cinematic shotgun blast that is Scarface. It is a tragedy about how a criminal tries to go straight but is ultimately doomed from the get-go. Penelope Ann Miller (\"Adventures in Babysitting\" is great as Brigante's love interest, and Luis Guzman always is a scene-stealer playing Pacino's right-hand man. \"Carlito's Way\" is a fantastic film that is sad in a sense, but states a sad truth. More-so, this is just fantastic entertainment pulled off by a superb performance from Pacino, and a great director Brian de Palma.Overall rating: 8 out of 10.",

Brian de Palma does his best to stick to what he's good at and I won't say he's rehashing his previous work, but there are elements that keep returning. Dark night clubs, sordid back alleys, bad neighbourhoods, stereotypical gangsters and movie violence, we've dealt with it before. The obligatory central idea this time is that crime doesn't pay, as expressed through the tone of the narration, there's an undying sadness to it. Carlito Brigante tries to steer clear but it's simply no use, and though there are some moments when things are actually looking fairly good, you never really feel at ease. You're not supposed to. Al Pacino is a great actor, but it's Sean Penn who's really giving a once in a lifetime performance. His character doesn't fit into a category, he's just some really bad person. Sadly this film still has too much of a \"more if the same\" feel to it, it doesn't bring much new to the table. Of course it's still great, de Palma knows what he's doing.",

De Palma's direction is once again inspired, especially when Carlito looks at his love interest under the rain, hiding from a it under a garbage can, watching her dance or during the action sequences. It's probably DePalma's film with the most obvious references to Hitchcock or Welles. (the snooker scene is just brilliant). An incredible movie about redemption, about the cost of happiness, and about failure, with a spectacular casting (a special mention to Sean Penn)and an incredible script.

            "content": "Any movie about an ex-con who tries to go straight but comes up against all sorts of obstacles, really has to be good to overcome the natural scepticism of audiences who will justifiably feel that they've seen it all before. Fortunately, there's enough about \"Carlito's Way\" that's original, interesting and enjoyable to prevent it from being seen as too hackneyed, too predictable or too run-of-the-mill and a great deal of the credit for this must be down to the fact that it's based on two books called \"Carlito's Way\" and \"After Hours\" which were both written by Judge Edwin Torres who, no doubt, drew extensively on his experience as a New York State supreme court judge to inject his story with its impressively high level of authenticity.In a New York City courtroom in 1975, Carlito Brigante (Al Pacino), a Puerto Rican drug dealer and alleged assassin, becomes a free man again after having served only 5 years of his 30-year prison sentence. The legal loophole that was exploited to secure his release was spotted by his shady lawyer and best friend David Kleinfeld (Sean Penn). Now feeling older and wiser after having had plenty of time to reflect on his life, Carlito announces to the court that he has been totally rehabilitated and is determined to leave his old criminal life behind and finally go straight.Carlito makes his first mistake when he returns to his old neighbourhood and is persuaded by his young cousin Guajiro (John Ortiz) to accompany him on a routine delivery of some drugs to a local dealer. Their meeting descends into chaos when Guajiro is double-crossed and murdered and after the ensuing shoot-out, Carlito finds himself back on the street but $30,000 richer, after having pocketed some money which had been left unattended after all the shooting had stopped.Carlito promptly uses his newly acquired windfall to buy a partnership in a nightclub with the intention of earning the $75,000 he'd need to fulfil his long-held ambition of taking up an offer he'd had from an old friend to buy a share in his car rental business in the Bahamas. Soon, he starts to make good progress in achieving his goal and things then get even better when he meets up with his ex-girlfriend Gail (Penelope Ann Miller) and they rekindle the relationship which they'd been forced to end when Carlito was imprisoned.An unwelcome development then follows when Kleinfeld is cornered into assisting an Italian mob boss to escape from the Riker's Island prison barge where he's been incarcerated and Carlito feels that he can't refuse when his friend asks for his help. When the escape plan is put into action, the seriously unstable and coked-up Kleinfeld kills both the mob boss and his son and this leads Carlito to decide that if he's ever going to fulfil his dream of going to the Bahamas with Gail and their unborn child, he'll need to do so rapidly because the mob boss' son and his men will inevitably be coming after him with revenge on their minds.Told in flashback with Carlito providing the narration, this gangster movie is consistently tense, violent and very fatalistic but it's also surprisingly romantic. The relationship between Carlito and Gail is beautifully portrayed throughout and a hug that they share soon after reconciling provides an especially warm and powerful expression of their feelings for each other. Similarly, there's another particularly romantic moment at the end of the movie when Carlito, accompanied by the sound of Joe Cocker's \"You Are So Beautiful\", stares wistfully at an illuminated advertisement which features a picture of a Caribbean Island and the slogan \"Escape to Paradise\".Brian De Palma's use of slow motion, black and white and revolving camera-work at various points is both stylish and effective and the extended chase sequence that brings the movie to its climax is brilliantly executed. Commendably, there's also a consistent vibrancy that runs through the whole movie that makes its duration seem significantly shorter than its actual 144 minutes.Al Pacino is marvellous as the ageing gangster whose downfall is ironically sealed by two of his more noble actions when he, through loyalty, agrees to help Kleinfeld and also unwisely shows mercy to another character who doesn't deserve it. Sean Penn is terrific as the corrupt, duplicitous and cocaine-fuelled lawyer who long ago lost sight of the line between what's legal and what isn't and the remaining cast members are also excellent with stand out contributions from Penelope Ann Miller, Luis Guzman and John Leguizamo (as the unforgettable \"Benny Blanco from the Bronx\").",

You might think that this movie adds little to the genre, also because it stars yet again Pacino in the main role as gangster. Well, this movie is surprising good and original enough which is also thanks to the always wonderful to look at style of directing by Brian De Palma, who before this with Pacino already made the much acclaimed gangster movie \"Scarface\".The movie its story is original and is about an ex-criminal who just got out of jail and is determined to stay on the good path and escapes his old life. But due to unforeseen circumstances and some old 'friends' he soon is, against his own will, pulled back again in the dark gangster underworld and activities of New York City. The movie features more than enough good and original moments and has plenty of memorable scene's.Of course once more the acting is top-class in this movie. Having Al Pacino playing the lead in a gangster movie is always jackpot and he once more succeeds in portraying a good and realistic character. Also truly excellent is Sean Penn in a role that you normally would never expect him in. John Leguizamo is also really good in a typical gangster role. The movie also features the now very well known Viggo Mortensen in one of his very first big movie roles.The movie has some good looking and professionally made shootouts and moments of violence. The whole ending at the train station really is the best part of the movie. Director Brian De Palma surely knows how to create some tense sequences and the end chase of this movie is once more proof of that.The movie has a fine musical score composed by Patrick Doyle. It's not always fitting for the movie but that doesn't take away that it's a good score.When you're a fan of gangster/crime movies this is an absolutely must see for you. Also for De Palma fans there is plenty to enjoy here. There are some typical De Palma moments and camera movements and the end sequences on the train station alone should be reason enough for De Palma fans to go and watch this movie.In my opinion this movie is even better than \"Scarface\".9/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/",

They may have heard of it, but you may get someone who doesn't even know that it exists. If you find it on television, it will be buried away at a graveyard slot and this is a shame as Carlito's Way is without doubt one of the finest crime films to grace the screen is undoubtedly the best collaboration between Al Pacino and Brian De Palma. I really like Scarface, it is a hugely enjoyable film, but if Scarface is more similar to a a bottle of beer, then Carlito's Way is more like a bottle of fine wine. It has a more graceful taste that less excessive taste goes down more easily. There is none of the excessiveness that punctuated Scarface. The production design is not as over the top, the violence is toned down a notch and the performance from Al Pacino is more restrained, bringing to mind his finest performances from the 1970's such as The Godfather Part I and II, Dog Day Afternoon and Serpico. Here he delivers a performance that undoubtedly deserved Oscar consideration, while De Palma proves there is more to him than just a stylish sensibility. Yes, there are many of his trademark directorial touches such as the prolonged suspense, the main action sequence taking place in a train station and frequent long takes where the camera continually moves and never stops. Truth is the story here is what makes this film so compelling, despite the foundations that it rests on being cliches from every other crime film that you will have ever seen.\nThe character of Carlito is released from prison and is determined to go straight. We all know that this will never happen. He wants to set up a new life in the Bahamas operating a car rental agency. This will never  happen. He wants to start this new life with the woman he loves. This too, we know, will never happen. What makes this film so brilliant is that De Palma decides not to treat the audience like idiots. The first image of the film is of Carlito being gunned down, lying on death's door in a train station. Immediately we know that this character is never going to escape and despite this De Palma still manages to squeeze every inch of suspense in the final moments. This makes the film one of the most moving that I have ever seen. We really grow to like this character to the point that we hope that he doesn't die in the final reel, but alas this is no fairy tale and no matter how hard he tries and how much we want him to, Carlito is doomed.Al Pacino's performance here is, and I cannot stress this enough, fantastic. He never shouts, never goes into blistering shouting mode, he delivers a performance of amazing restraint that one quickly realizes why he is always at the top of lists that deem him to be the finest actor working today. The supporting cast here also put in some great work. Sean Penn quite possibly puts in a career best performance as Carlito's lawyer, the character who is the real villain of the piece, while Penelope Anne Miller is luminous as Gail, the love of Carlito's life.  The chemistry between both Miller and Pacino is superb and one really gains a sense of why they are willing to run away from it all at the end of the film.Behind the camera De Palma proves what a versatile and fantastic filmmaker he is. Forever doomed to be known as a director of Hitchcock tributes, he shows us what he is really like behind the camera, proving to his detractors that he can make material on his own merit. Unlike previous films he has made, you will be hard pressed to find homages to Hitchcock and Eisenstein films here. This is undoubtedly his finest picture and one that should have earned him a nomination for best director at the 1993 Academy Awards. Likewise Pacino and Miller. Amazingly Penn did get a much deserved award for his performance, amazing because for once the Academy did something right.On top of all this we have a fantastic music score from Patrick Doyle and one of the most moving death scenes in recent memory, if you have yet to see Carlito's Way, please do. It is quite simply a masterpiece.",

However, when he revisits his old neighborhood, all of his past memories come back to haunt him in a flash, starting with a shootout in the back of a barber shop. Director Brian De Palma ('Scarface') teams up with Al Pacino ('The Godfather' films) once again to film this movie, and it works. Unlike Scarface, Carlito's Way had much more of a smooth flow that tells a story without too much violence in it, and what Carlito was trying to do to get away from his past. Every minute of the film is gold. The performances are the key in this movie, and every performer is great with their role. To me, the one that stood out the most was Sean Penn's ('21 Grams') character because it showed just how his character could change in a matter of time. He was the most convincing character in the movie. This film also gave John Leguizamo ('Ice Age 1 & 2') better recognition as an actor. Overall, this is a classic film of the crime genre, and should not be overlooked. -- (10/10)",

The first time I saw this movie I missed the first 10 minutes but caught on quickly, I was familiar with Gangster redemption tales and this seemed to fit in with those. The movie really captured me with the snooker 'trick shot' scene and for the rest of the film I was hooked. By the time I had reached the ending I had grown to care for Carlito Brigante immensely and was extremely tense in the getaway scene. Every close call i was rubbing sweat off my palms. I truly wanted this character to escape his inevitable(?) doom. At last I thought he had made it and was literally jumping for the air when the killer shock comes...Carlito is killed by a two-bit punk I had forgotten about 'Benny Blanco from the Bronx'. The shock hit me hard and I was deeply moved by Pacino's monologue. The credits rolled and I had been exhilarated and moved by this story ad would straight-away have given it 10 stars.However, last night I saw the movie was on and set a reminder, I saw the movie from the start...big mistake. The opening credits are a montage of shots from the end sequence, totally taking the shock away from the ending, moving the surprise from Carlito dying, to who killed him which makes the impact of the last scene seriously dampened. If you know from the start he does not make it you have lessened your enjoyment considerably.Never-the-less this movie is still must see despite De Palmas idiotic mistake of the opening credits his style remains and several shots are breathtaking. Pacino is at his usual best, one look with those eyes out-acts any Tom Hanks or Tom Cruise performance. Just cut the opening credits if you make a directors cut Brian...pleeeeeaaaassseee!",

After watching Dog Day Afternoon last year, I was blown away by his performance, but thought it may be the only standout in his career. After seeing Carlito's Way, however, I can say without question that, at the very least, he had two career performances. The 1993 film directed by Brian De Palma was a brilliant film exploring the life of a former Puerto Rican convict pledging to stay on the straight and narrow. Starring Al Pacino in a brilliantly acted role, along with Sean Penn, and Penelope Ann Miller, Carlito's Way was an artful representation of the wide-reaching impact the mafia has on those inside it, and just how hard it is to leave that lifestyle.Pledging to stay on the right path after his release from prison, a release due to a legal technicality obtained by his less than ethical lawyer, David Kleinfeld (Sean Penn) Carlito(Al Pacino) vows to stop selling drugs and make a living in a more honest way. In hopes to leave his trafficking ways behind, Carlito takes over a nightclub in hopes to raise enough money to leave New York and the mob scene behind. Along the way, Carlito is tempted to return to his ways and encounters mobsters out to get him at almost every turn. When Carlito resumes a relationship with Gail, (Penelope Ann Miller) the dancer he fell in love with before he went to prison, he is more determined than ever to live an honest life, perhaps even settling down in marriage and fatherhood. When he learns that his lawyer and friend, David has gotten himself into trouble with the Italian mob, he feels it is his duty to help him, no matter the cost. Helping David, however, ends up getting Carlito into more trouble than he may be able to escape.I experienced a fair bit of amazement upon finishing Carlito's Way. Having not experienced many De Palma films, I was in awe of aspects that are probably typical for the director. For instance, the entire film is gorgeously shot. De Palma's use of color is brilliant, beautifully encapsulating the vibrant energy of Carlito's environment. The camera work was mesmerizing; De Palma shows his mastery through brilliant low-angle shots, effective bird's-eye view shots, some of the most masterful tracking shots I have ever seen, and pans and overlays like a genius. Carlito's Way is an example of the unique way that film truly is moving art on-screen. The performances De Palma was able to pull from his principles help cement the film in one of the most formulaic genres. I never thought I would buy AL Pacino as a Puerto Rican, nor anything other than Italian, but his nuanced performance with enough unique idiosyncracies will have anyone buying his portrayal hook, line, and sinker. Sean Penn is also brilliant in a role that requires an equal mix of evil and naivety, something difficult to imagine Penn pulling off. Narration can go one of two ways in a film, but in Carlito's Way, the titular Carlito narrating much of his life was absolutely perfect. One of the best aspects of the film was the chase scene taking up the last 20 minutes or so of the film. The fact that De Palma chose to do a dramatic chase scene done on foot was sensational. Car chases, boat chases, train chases, even motorcycle chases have all been done before, but to film a chase scene that takes place on foot, proving tension can still be established in an underused way proves De Palma's mastery as a director, and one that I now vow to use more of his work. A true standout in the genre, Carlito's Way is truly a gut-wrenching watch, full of suspense and brilliant story telling more than worthy of a viewing.",

            "content": "This film is often seen as the follow up to Brian De Palma's Scarface, and while the films share a logical line of progression and the same director and star, they're not related really. To be honest, I'm not a big fan of Scarface. That film has it's moments and a great powerful turn by Al Pacino; but it's also very messy, overlong and relies on it's good elements a bit too much. Carlito's Way suffers from some of the same problems that Scarface did; but on the whole, this is a much more assured, far better made and just generally superior crime flick. As mentioned, Al Pacino takes the lead role and is on fine form as the recently released criminal Carlito Brigante with the desire to go straight. Unlike most criminals, Carlito has realised that a life of crime is only going to lead him to an early grave, and has therefore decided to get out before it gets that far. However, things aren't so simple and when his lawyer friend David Kleinfeld who got him out of jail needs Carlito's help to get a client of his out of the can, it isn't long before Carlito realises that walking away is more difficult than it appears.I've never subscribed to the idea that Al Pacino is one of the greatest actors ever. He's good, but he chooses roles that are too similar far too often. This film sees him in another familiar place, but this time he brings more to the table than usual. The way that he bleakly reminisces is brilliant and this brooding performance is definitely one of his best. Al Pacino is the star of this film, but wrestling him for every scene they share is Sean Penn, who's on fine form! Penn gives life to the sleazy lawyer brilliantly, and it's impossible to watch this film and not absolutely hate his guts. The acting isn't what makes Carlito's Way what it is, however; it's the plot and style that do that. De Palma is well known for 'borrowing' from other directors, and a lot of this film feels like it could have been taken from an old crime movie. De Palma was at the height of his confidence with this film, and that is always evident. The plot is brilliantly thought-out, and it isn't too far away from truly great character pieces, the likes of William Shakespeare. The ironic ending being of particular note. Pacino's voice over gives the film it's final edge; it's haunting, the way that Carlito reflects upon his life of crime.",

Not so Brian De Palma however.De Palma's inconsistency has never been in doubt, it's always prevalent. Yet surely one would question a man who casts Al Pacino first as a Cuban (\"Scarface\") and then as a Puerto Rican. Pacino is the most Italian looking guy in Hollywood. Mind you he gives a professional performance, and Sean Penn, as his corrupt Jewish lawyer, is again outstanding.\"Carlito's Way\" is impressively shot too, but De Palma lets the film ramble on too long, and makes the mistake of showing the conclusion of the story at the beginning of the show (ala \"Intersection\"). A shorter, more action-thriller type approach would have worked much better than this failed endeavour. \"Carlito\" did not require the depth this movie tries to supply.A reasonable night's entertainment, highlighted by a well staged action sequence in the underground at Grand Central Station.Friday, May 13, 1994 - Astor Theatre",

I love this film. The tone of it. Everything, It's a sad story, and A.Pacino gives one of his strongest performances in not overacting, but for one you can feel, and root for, you truly believe that Carlito is on his way to a better life, and now he is a good person, who tries to escape the world that surrounds him. Everyone in this film gives a superb performances: Sean Penn, Penelope Ann Miller and Viggo Mortensen in his small but very memorable performance.

Directed by Brian de Palma, as others point out, it is inevitable to compare it to Scarface. However, each film deserves to stand on its own.Pacino here plays Carlito Brigante, an ex-drug lord who, when he gets out of prison, decides to go straight. The story is told in flashback. He needs $75,000 to buy into a car rental business with a friend of his in Florida. To get the money, he agrees to manage a sleazy nightclub. Well, going straight turns out to be not that easy. He has a cocaine-addicted lawyer (Sean Penn) with his own problems -- problems that affect Charlie (Carlito) negatively. Not to mention the fact that the people around him assume that he wants back in, when he doesn't. And he has to convince the girl he left behind (Miller) that he's changed and get her back into his life. It's all a big struggle.Truly excellent film with the usual de Palma violence, but the story is well told and the characters are fleshed out and interesting. Pacino is fantastic as a conflicted man who wants to help his friends but is determined to go straight. Sean Penn matches him in an excellent performance - these truly are two of our greatest actors. Penelope Ann Miller does a great job. Her character is in love with Charlie -- in fact, they're soulmates, but she can't bear to be around him if he hasn't gotten out of the life.A great script, fine direction, wonderful performances, a great soundtrack, great cinematography, a must see. Carlito's Way is suspenseful in spots, less violent than Scarface, and it's not as action-filled as Scarface because it also deals with a love story. Very compelling filmmaking.",

The Pool Room Scene and the Climax Stand Out and are Vintage De Palma.

            "content": "Al Pacino has starred as a prominent gangster in several masterpieces: \"Godfather\" I, II, and III, as well as \"Scarface\", have shown his undisputed talent. In all four of them, Pacino played the mean and ruthless mobster, who dominates the street: Either as a skillful and much-feared \"capo di capi\" in the \"Godfather\" series, or as a talented, yet self-destructive, mobster who rises to the top (and then collapses) in \"Scarface\".\"Carlito's Way\" would seem to be a replica of the above successful formula, at first sight: Al Pacino is Carlito Brigante, a mobster who has just got out of jail with the help of his friend and lawyer, David Kleinfeld (Penn). However, this is where the similarities end. Whereas in all the above films Pacino is portrayed as a determined and unreformed criminal to the very end, Carlito is a very different type of guy: In fact, as soon as he is out, he has taken the brave decision to change path. He wants to give up his criminal ways, and become an honest citizen. To this end, he runs a bar, trying to collect some money so as to set up a car-rental business. However, although he has the wholehearted support of his girlfriend Gail (Miller) to this project, it is difficult to escape his past. Even his friend and lawyer, Kleinfeld, proves to be an obstacle to his road towards salvation.Brian De Palma has directed a great film, in which he portrays brilliantly the character of a man who agonizes to make a clean start, but encounters everywhere forces which push him back to his dark roots. Al Pacino is (again) great, while both Penelope Ann Miller and Sean Penn are very good as the two competing and opposite influences for Carlito.\"Carlito's Way\" is less a crime film, and more a drama one, according to my opinion. The story is beautiful, and although the beginning of the film seems to give some hints, we do not know until the very end whether this man of good intentions managed to escape from his ghosts or not. Watch and find for yourselves! 8/10.",

            "content": "The understandable temptation is to compare \"Carlito's Way\" with \"Scarface\"--Al Pacino as a Hispanic lead character embroiled gangster wars--but the two films are nothing alike in their approach. \"Scarface\" takes a definitive \"shoot-em-up\" line, while \"Carlito's Way\" is far more character-driven. And it is an excellent film, drawing us into the underworld as a closed system with its own set of rules and a society truly apart from \"good old-fashioned mainstream American justice,\" so that we can sympathize with these characters despite their criminality.Some may find the romance scenes distracting. Graphic, certainly, but the addition of Penelope Ann Miller plays Gail extremely well opposite Pacino, and furthermore is a valuable addition to the cast for the way she fits into the theme. As a female character who walks the line between the beacon of moral light that is traditionally a woman in such a story and playing--in a woman's way--with the ambiguities of quick cash versus personal integrity, she helps Carlito to take a step back and think about the global implications of his struggle and his choices.Sean Penn's character was perhaps a bit more difficult for me to swallow: while the filmmakers went out of their way to foreshadow potential trouble, they failed to show much to indicate a deeply compromised internal character until almost right before the climax.As for the scene at Grand Central Terminal, what can I say? Clich\u00e9, perhaps, but extremely well-executed. The idea of having to catch the train and running up against that narrow wall of time and death when everything in your world is at stake is a nightmare I have dreamt many times over and easily kept me on the edge of the seat. (Incidently, I don't think I've ever made the train/plane before waking up, but neither can I recall actually missing it.)All-in-all, good for a quick evening alone with some whiskey in a big city besides New York to make you think about going back to New York... almost.",

He vows to stay clean and he reunites with his former girlfriend, Gail. However thanks to snotty, corrupted lawyer, that may not happen after all.The acting is fantastic. Pacino of course makes every film of his watchable. Sean Penn did a great job but I just hated his character.Overall, this is a classic gangster film. I think that more people should see this.

I watched it and WOW! This film is probably one of the most under rated movies I've ever had the knowledge of. I've watched it at least 5 times since October 28th and it hasn't gotten even the least bit old or too familiar. Easily superior to Pacino and De Palma's earlier rendezvous \"Scarface\" in terms of wit, cast, and overall performance. The character of Carlito is like a more humanly motivated version of Tony Montanna, and a good guy somewhat compared to the vicious Montanna. Pacino has also gotten more comfortable with his role of a Puerto Rican character since Scarface also, this time his accent's way more convincing and one of the film's high points. Sean Penn also gives the performance of a career playing Carlito's two faced, coke head lawyer.This movie is a masterpiece, one of the top ten films I believe everyone should see.",

No stranger to gangster flicks Brian De Palma holds the director rains and creates some great tension, notably the pool game scene and the boat segment with David Kleinfeld played by a dedicated and not quite recognisable Sean Penn. Penn's performance was justly nominated for a Golden Globe. Pacino puts on a convincing show and you really feel for the character and Carlito's struggles with his unsavoury past life and his attempt to rekindle a relationship with Gail (Penelope Ann Miller). John Leguizamo is excellent in his brief role as a fly new up and coming criminal Benny Blanco 'from the Bronx' and is a fitting contrast to Pacino's aged experienced gangster. There is an array of great performances from the supporting cast that includes a wheelchair bound Viggo Mortensen, club owner Jorge Porcel who play Saso 'used to be Ron' and right-hand man Luis Guzm\u00e1n.While made in 1993 it's set in 1975, the 70's feel and some lingo is captured perfectly, the locations, the sound, the music, the clothes are all painstakingly recreated.

I can honestly say that this is highly recommended like \"Scarface\".Al Pacino's character (Carlito Brigante) has sprung from prison on a legal technicality by his cocaine-addled attorney, former drug kingpin Carlito Brigante stuns the local underworld when he vows to go straight. Taking a job managing a glitzy, low-life nightclub, he tracks down his onetime girlfriend and rekindles their romance, promising he's changed for good. But Carlito's dream of going legitimate is undermined at every turn by murderous former cronies and even deadlier young thugs out to make a name for themselves. Ultimately, however, his most dangerous enemy is himself. Despite good intentions, Carlito's misguided loyalties and an outmoded code of \"honor\" will plunge him into a savage life-or-death battle against the relentless forces that refuse to let him go.

He begins by rekindling his relationship with ex-lover Gail (Golden Globe nominated Penelope Ann Miller), buying a night club and saving money to go to the Bahamas.

First, he becomes the owner of El Paraiso and has a fight with dealer Benny Blanco (John Leguizamo) for some money business and meets his former girlfriend Gail and all seems like a dream, but trouble is in the air: Kleinfeld ended having trouble with mafia boss Tony Tagliaucci and his family, and involving Carlito he murders father and son Tagliaucci. The next morning someone hurts Kleinfeld and Carlito is suspected, and after managing to kill Kleinfeld he will escape the goons out for him in a breath-taking sequence in the train station up until the last betrayal...The direction by Brian de Palma was surprisingly good, a bit reminiscent of his better movies. There are many good performances as well. Al Pacino plays a criminal that wants to start a new life but is forced to return back to his steps because of the ghosts that haunt him, and he plays the part nicely and in a subtler way (surely a surprise for his fans). Sean Penn is also good as the sleazy friend of Carlito that manages to make him return to crime, and Penelope Ann Miller gives an heart-felt performance other than being gorgeous. The supporting cast (James Rebhorn as a cranky lawyer, Viggo Mortensen as a wheelchair-bound former criminal, John Leguizamo as a womanizing dealer) was very nice and looked like they had a nice time.For the first hour and 38 minutes the movie had some slow moments but in the last 30 minutes it takes a different turn for good.

It bears a closer resemblance to \"Boogie Nights\" or even \"GoodFellas,\" though it has the epic quality of neither. Though the film is nearly two and-a-half hours, we don't feel as if we've been subjected to a long slog. The only slow moments in the film come in the more tender moments between Pacino and the girl.At the time, ten years ago, Pacino was still relevant, going on smoky tirades. Here, we see him enunciating his words like a cross between a Puerto Rican from Noo Yawk and a Southern Baptist minister preaching the gospel. He throws his voice around like a ventriloquist; he doesn't yell like he's known for now -- there are no blowup courtroom scenes here. (Actually, I'm lying. There is one at the very beginning, but it's fun, so don't worry.) And his voice-over narration never rises above a husky whisper. Most reviews I've seen have praised Pacino's work here, and they're right to. It's the opposite of something like \"Scent of a Woman,\" a film I enjoyed, with a performance from Pacino that was terrific. Here, he's quieter, more soulful. (The beard was a big plus, somehow it makes him more huggable.)Carlito (Pacino) has just been sprung from jail by his lawyer, Kleinfeld (Penn), and after he picks up $25,000 during a tense drug exchange, he decides to go into a club business with Saso, who's got gambling debts, until he can get $75,000 and get out of the life for good. Penn, in wiry glasses and a Jewfro, with his down-turned nose plays Kleinfeld as a coke-sniffing tough-guy wannabe. We watch as Kleinfeld drifts from the lawful to the criminal; or more aptly, we see more and more of his character come to surface. One of Kleinfeld's clients at Riker's prison barge insists that Kleinfeld, who he believes ripped him off of a million bucks, bust him out of jail or be killed. Carlito stands by Kleinfeld throughout the film, even when he gets dumped on by the police, his girl, and even Kleinfeld himself for doing so.The supporting players are roundly interesting and well-played. In the first moments we meet a young up-and-comer Benny Blaco, and John Leguizamo plays him flamboyantly. Luis Guzm\u00e1n plays one of Carlito's workers at the club. As Lalin, Viggo Mortensen makes a quick appearance -- probably helped along by Penn -- as a now-crippled, former suave heartbreaker turned into a sniveling embarrassment.But really, all the innovation here comes from Penn. Look at how slowly, how slyly his character evolves. It's really a wonder to get such growth in a film performance.The film is admittedly flawed. For instance, something simple like Carlito's ex-lover not instantly recognizing his very recognizable voice is unlikely. The entire secondary story with Carlito's ex-lover Gail could have been handled better, or another way. That's not to say she's completely useless: she provides the ending with a little oomph.The film is vicious, ruthless, and the emotions run high. There's a strange honesty throughout the film, too, mainly through the dialogue, that's sort of indescribable. Also, there's always a sense of humor here, like when \"You Are So Beautiful\" plays while Carlito reaches out for Gail through a chained door. (It's either humor or a really, really bad grab at sentiment.) When the song is played again over the closing credits, that time around there's an entire history attached to it, and it's played for sad irony.Ultimately, it's not a profound work, but it's a worthy entertainment. It's predictable, through to De Palma's credit he admits that even he knows this at the beginning of the film, with black and white images, a dreamy camera, and a sentimental score. In the film, De Palma's camera moves around, showing us what we're interested in taking a peek at, and it plays a pivotal role in building up the tension for an incredibly well-crafted climax at Grand Central Station, complete with an amazing, gliding, nearly floating tracking shot. The finale, the last twenty minutes or so, is some kind of masterpiece and definitely leaves you with a good aftertaste.***1/2",

It remains to this day one of my favorites. Unlike many \"blockbusters\" these days, with their massive budgets, special effects etc etc, but pedestrian scripts, what sets Carlito's Way apart is the wonderful story, that for me had me totally invested in Carlito (Al Pacino) as he tries to leave his past behind and \"go straight\". Here was a man, genuinely trying to turn his life around, to leave his criminal past behind him and make an honest living, but events and circumstances conspire against him, despite his best efforts. A potential threat, that in the past he would have dealt with ruthlessly and violently to neutralize, now he ignores it, he doesn't want to resort to violence to solve, and as a result, it changes the whole trajectory of his future. I won't give the ending away, but it's genuinely moving. Wonderful performances all round, especially Al Pacino and Sean Penn. I tossed up between giving this a nine or ten out of ten, but settled on a nine. A wonderful movie as I said, that will remain in your memory long after you've seen it.",

This same actor/director team worked together previously on another classic gangster film Scarface. While there are some similarities between the two films as they both deal with Latino gangsters and both are great looking movies greatly benefited by Brian De Palma's use of lush visuals. Carlito's Way is a great character piece for Pacino as Carlito, an old school gangster who tries his hardest to walk away from his life in crime, but constantly finds himself back to his old habits. He is joined by Sean Penn as a sleazy lawyer who Carlito goes into business with running a nightclub.Penelope Ann Miller is stunning as his woman and Luis Guzman is cool as always as Carlito's right hand man. Carlito's Way is a look into the underworld and Pacino is interesting and likeable as a criminal who is trying to get out of the life and has a code of honor. The direction here is solid and performances are very good as well.",

He re-enters a world that is different from the one he left and it's not long before he gets roped into trouble. How Carlito navigates the muddy waters of escaping the street life while also trying to earn enough money to \"retire\" is what this movie is all about. He has a renegade lawyer dragging him down played by Sean Penn, an old friend that's still a hothead played by Luis Guzman, and an up-and-comer trying to be him played by John Leguizamo.Matters only got more complicated when he hooked up with his old flame named Gail (Penelope Ann Miller). She was everything Carlito wasn't: blond, white, non-street. She didn't even call him Carlito, she called him Charlie as if with her he transformed into a different more socially acceptable person.\"Carlito's Way\" is a good movie, but it can't touch \"The Godfather 2\" or \"Scarface.\"",

This is a very decent gangster movie; I was impressed with both the performances of the main cast and the production. But more of that later, here's a short summary first (summary haters please wait in the car with Pachanga; we got some business to attend to\u0085) Carlito Brigante has just got out of jail on a technicality. He was supposed to go down for thirty years, but thanks to the hard work of his lawyer, David Kleinfeld, he gets out in five. He vows that he will not return to his life of crime and intends to go straight from now on. This, as we discover, proves a little harder than Carlito at first thinks. Things have changed a lot on the streets in the five years he's been inside, but there are still some of his old associates about. Carlito has a plan, a plan that depends on him getting his hands on $75,000. The trouble is there are not very many legitimate ways to get your hands on that kind of cash. David Kleinfeld sets him up with a job, running a night club that he has a stake in and, at first, things seem to be running OK. He re-kindles the relationship with his ex-girlfriend, Gail, a dancer, and she is keen for him to go straight also. But then he is slowly dragged back into the world he is trying to escape by David and the colourful company he has dealings with. I will leave my summary there; don't want to give too much away.Although I found it a little long, I did enjoy this film. For the most part it is engaging and it is sometimes slightly unpredictable. Great cinematography and I thought the use of music was also very well done. Great performances from Al Pacino as Carlito 'Charlie' Brigante, Sean Penn as David Kleinfeld and Penelope Ann Miller as Gail. Honourable mentions must also go to, John Leguizamo as Benny Blanco, Ingrid Rogers as Steffie, Luis Guzm\u00e1n as Pachanga and Viggo Mortensen as Lalin.As I've already said, I felt this film was a little too long. I also felt that a little too much was made of the love story between Carlito and Gail. I think that Pacino maybe isn't as convincing on screen as a romantic lead. But having said that, the love story does have its place at the send of the day. Quite an enjoyable film over all with some great performances\u0085 Recommended.My score: 7.9/10",

Pacino stamps his mark on this film in a role that can't help but be compared to his classic role as Michael Corleone, in both the first Godfather, and the final one. He plays Carlito Brigante, an old streetlord trying to go legitimate (sound familiar?). The basic storyline does no justice to this film though, for it is what lies beneath that really captures the imagination. The story develops into a complex, yet followable tale. The subplots intervene at perfect times. The overiding desire to become straight really is evident in Carlito's character. I still haven't caught my breath after this one. The end is unthinkable. It had the tell tale signs of being a very predictable finale, until the final twist.Pacino oozes street instinct right from the very first scene of trouble. This film was made for him, although his voice is rather annoying at the start of the film, until it becomes more familiar. If ever he came close to bettering Michael Corleone, it is this role.",

The presence of Pacino make comparisons to Scarface inevitable, and Carlito's Way could actually be a kind of sequel, assuming Pacino got nabbed at the end of Scarface, got out after five years thanks to a technicality and decided to go straight. His hood friends and sleaze bag lawyer, however, make sure he gets sucked back into a life of not just crime but criminal intrigue, complete with double-crossing and murder. Scarface had a certain macho appeal to everything, but I always liked this one better. It's a more hard-boiled crime thriller, and less superficially pretty in its production design and cinematography. The criminal scheming has a greater complexity to it, and the mobster characters seem more desperate and closer to the edge. Scarface was played out in the big money high stakes world of the cocaine trade, but here the possibility of death by double cross seems to hang on the heels of everybody much more. Sean Penn's lawyer character, like any good movie villain, seems capable of anything, and drives the action by weaving schemes around one character and then another and having them double cross each other. This makes for an interestingly plotted movie as we follow one scheme after another, each trickier and more desperate than the last, some succeeding, others falling apart. The question is not whether it will all come down at the end, but rather who will manage to dodge the fallout.",

Determined to go straight, Carlito shrugs off all advances from crooks old and new but is eventually drawn back into a quagmire of trouble by his cokehead lawyer (Sean Penn dressed up as Disco Stu from The Simpsons, who also deserved to take home a Best Supporting Actor Oscar)The 145 minute running time passes in a breeze and there's loads of interesting story developments to keep you hooked. But DePalma's sterile widescreen photography and sets reek of the crassness of Scarface.

Pacino goes from Cuban mobster in Florida to Puerto Rican drug lord in the barrio. Not much has changed in my neighborhood as far as locations are concerned with the Metro North running above Park Avenue. The only difference is the clean-up it has undergone with police presence. But once upon a time, there was little safety walking down the streets of East Harlem, and this documents those ugly violent times where gang members didn't break into sing and dance a la \"West Side Story\".Practically every well known tough looking Hispanic actor makes an appearance in this, including several comics who show off their dramatic chops. While John Leguizamo went onto great fame in comedy standup, Rick Aviles (in a bit role as a brutal thug who gets a violent demise) is best known for the murdered in \"Ghost\", yet had a promising career in comedy before his early death. Among the other Hispanic actors, Luis Guzman stands out as Pacino's best friend who stands by him until a shocking end. Individual moments with these characters make you want them to escape, just as other moments want to make you see them fry.So while the cast is uniformally great (including a much disguised Sean Penn as an equally messed up defense attorney), the lives their characters lead are not so respectable. Through Pacino's voice over's, you get to hear his inner voice longing for a way out, but like Moses being lead to the burning bush, it's his destiny. He loves a beautiful white dancer (Penelope Ann Miller), but escaping his life is out of the question thanks to his past always sneaking up behind him. There are enemies who openly hate him (Leguizamo), those he trusts who betray him (Penn and Guzman) and the woman who loves him (Miller) and openly fears seeing him dying slowly in the middle of the night. While the film runs a lengthy 2 1/2 hours, the horrors of the every day fears will keep you mesmerized. Throats are slit, heads are bashed in, and flying bullets strike their victims in the most shocking of places. Many of the characters are pretty much perverts or beyond reproach, although there's a subtle hint of the gentleman in the often philosophical Carlito, as far away from \"Scarface's\" Tony Montana that Pacino and director Brian DePalma could make him. But it's obvious that this is a life where there are no winners. Like Faye Dunaway reveals as Bonnie Parker sadly, the only way out is death.",

The Godfather trilogy, Scent of a Woman and Heat punctuate a golden filmography for the charismatic Puerto Rican, but it is in one of his lesser-known films, Carlito's Way, that Pacino gives one of his most impressive performances.Brian De Palma, who directed Pacino in Scarface, chooses to begin his film at the end, which allows him to use the eponymous Carlito himself as narrator. In the opening sequences we see Carlito released from jail on a technicality 5 years into a 25-year sentence for narcotics smuggling. He is intent on going straight, but a corrupt lawyer and his old drugs cronies among other elements stand in the way of his dream, an `escape to paradise.'Loyalty is the most profound theme the film explores, as Carlito's anachronistic code of honour and the resuming of his relationship with Miller, after a 5-year hiatus, dominate the picture.Carlito's Way is a film that will largely appeal to a male audience, as it explores a man's adjustment to a changed world, and his one-mindedness in attempting to escape that cruel world. That world, late-1970s New York, is well created in the picture, with an early disco soundtrack doing much to craft that setting. There is terrific range in De Palma's movie: the set-pieces are highly memorable, the script, adapted from two Edwin Torres novels very sharp, and Miller is adequate as the necessary love interest. Pacino is as charismatic as he ever has been, delivering his lines with characteristic flair.Carlito's personal narration, which gives the viewers insight into his hopes, fears, mistakes and dreams, ensures that Carlito's Way will have universal appeal.

And it's not only because of legal reasons, but moral too. He wants to start over, become a better person. That proves not to be so easy, as he already starts to fail on the first day...Holy. S'hit. This movie is a f'ucking masterpiece. Rarely have I before seen such a heartbreakingly honest and involving movie or gotten so infatuated with a character that I got completely lost into the movie so much that it felt like real life. The dialogue is a fantastic mix of philosophy, heart and even a little tint of humor. Al Pacino and Sean Penn are both so incredible in their roles that it's hard to decide who's the better of them. The music is tremendous. And of course, how can I do this review without mentioning Brian De Palma's directing? There are lots of creative camera angles and the action (when it happens) is more intense than I've seen in any other movie. Gorgeous is what it is.Carlito is an ex-gangster who just wants to do the right thing at the same time as he finds it hard to fight against his gangster instincts and can snap anytime. Kleinfeld is a lawyer who used to live the perfect life but quickly screws it up more and more. And... he's nuts. He's out of his mind! Which means it's a perfect role for Penn, doesn't it?The love story between Carlito and Gail is beautiful and doesn't feel the least bit unnatural. The scenes between the two are very humane and among the more romantic parts of the movie. The chemistry is astonishing! Al Pacino and Penelope Anne Miller make for a wonderful screen couple.What really breaks this apart from all the other gangster flicks is its story. Where else do you find one where the main character doesn't want to be a gangster and enjoy the high life, but actually get out of the hellhole that it is? Carlito is unusually enough not somebody you think is cool but know is an asshole. He's somebody who regret his evil ways and wants to be a good person once and for all, THAT makes him cool.I was horrified and cried when it got to the ending!

            "content": "***SPOILERS***   ***SPOILERS*** \"Carlito's Way\" is a work of incredible filmmaking.  It is not without its flaws... as has been stated, Penelope Ann Miller's acting skills are not the best in the world, and a few lines seemed a bit out of place to me, such as right at the end in the voice-over when Carlito says \"Gail's gonna make a good mom.\"  That didn't seem to fit the situation too well and sounded a bit corny to me, but no screenplay is perfect (American Beauty comes durned close, but that's another story).The sheer realism depicted in this film is enough to recommend it.  Sean Penn gives the most brilliant performance of his career, in my opinion, and Pacino makes the Carlito character come to sparkling life (although he should have worked a bit more on the spanish accent -- he slips a few times and doesn't quite sound like a native, especially in the few lines where he actually speaks spanish).But these are minor quibbles.  \"Carlito's Way\" gets better every time I see it, and that's enough to put the movie in my top ten list of favorites (I've seen hundreds and hundreds of films).  \"Casino\" is excellent but too depressing to watch very often, \"Goodfellas\" is also excellent but is not repeatedly viewable like \"Carlito's Way.\"  Scenes like the one where Carlito is standing in the rain with a garbage can lid watching Gail dance, and the entire sequence towards the beginning when his cousin gets killed in a drug deal gone wrong, are just unforgettable.  This movie is full of such unforgettable screen-burning scenes and brilliant lines.  It's truly a feast for the eyes, ears and mind.If you haven't seen \"Carlito's Way\" yet and you appreciate the \"neo-gangster\" genre, you're missing out big time.  If possible, see it on a big-screen TV, in the DVD format.  The final scene where the \"Paradise\" poster comes alive and then fades to purple is just so moving, the colour needs to fill a whole room and reflect off all the windows and walls.  The perfect closure to a true work of art.9/10.",

            "content": "As charismatic and smooth as ever, the mesmerising Al Pacino stars - with help from the excellent Sean Penn - in one of the many roles he was 'born to play'.Carlito Brigante chooses to lead a quiet life after being released from prison. But when he reluctantly becomes a part of a drug deal, he realises that there is no escape.Brian De Palma's Carlito's Way doubled its budget in the box office and in the eyes of eager cinephiles, it really could've trebled its numbers, through its classic crime, thrilling shoot of scenes at a fast pace and intense atmosphere. The ever-moving picture stretches landscape from the smoking streets of urban New York, to green, serene plots by soothing waters. Though the movie very rarely matches its background; David Koepp articulates his screenplay to highlight each characters' hubris in contrast to their high-standing status.A cyclical structure that loops and twists throughout the 140 minutes, De Palms successfully crafts his vision of every scene to leave a lasting remark on the audience, one which allows an array of emotions to be tested, as the eyes remain fixated on a sensational masterpiece. The particular Grand Central Station scene comes to mind, a drawn out, heart-pounding, nail-biting exchange that feels almost 2 hours alone. Equally, a memorable early morning boat trip, hits the same as the perfect pool shot in a backstreet bar.Accompanying Pacino's brilliance, Penelope Ann Miller deserved her Golden Globe nomination for Best Supporting Actress in 1994, the innocence complimenting elegance is the perfect tonic to the hard-hitting, tough male lead's. Sean Penn is a character who's journey is portrayed to be the most drastic, a man consumed by power, who can't stay in his lane is captured with class on camera.Finally, 1993's release, adapted from Edwin Torres' twin novels of the same name as well as 'After Hours' gifts cinema with arguably the greatest character names of all time: long live Benny Blanco from the Bronx.Rating: 8.7/10.",

It just completely blew me away. it is a fantastic movie, plain and simple. Sean Penn is brilliant as Pacino's crooked lawyer, his acting is convincing but looks so effortless. As this movie finished i sat still for a few minutes just going over the movie in my head, thinking about how good it is. If you get the chance to see it, you should, you will not be disappointed. If you have yet to be convinced of how good Pacino really is (unlikely if you have seen Scarface,The Godfather,Scent of a Woman) go see Carlito's Way. Work of a genius!",

            "content": "The recent viewing of this movie for the first time since it was released in the mid 90s confirmed my long held beliefs: this is some of Mr. Pachino's best work on film. But not only does he shine as Carlito, great performances from Penelope Ann Miller (his love interest) and Sean Penn (Carlito's lawyer) are masterfully directed by Brian De Palma in a credible tale of attempted redemption.In this gritty crime/gangster tale, Carlito is released from incarceration on a technicality, and thus begins his attempts to stay clean and legitimate after squandering a lifetime that had culminated with his 30 year sentence. His goal is simple: secure enough money to buy his way into a legitimate business venture. But achieving this is another story altogether. The journey we witness is walking a fine line in the old neighborhood, where he must compete with his reputation among both his peers and the up and coming thugs who have hustled their way into prominence since his conviction some five or so years earlier.Carlito proves to be a complex character with a solid understanding of both right and wrong, as well as very strong ambitions. These two traits are quite often opposed with one another, and it is in this conflict that De Palma brings out the best of Pachino. Somewhere along the way Carlito has won you to his cause, and despite the character flaws and set backs, you want to see him achieve his dream. But as the story unfolds, the stakes and risks are greater and his success seems less likely.What I especially enjoyed in this movie was the narration Pachino had of Carlito in many crucial or pivotal parts of the script. Unlike many of his more well known and recognized roles, where Pachino had long brooding scenes, it was left to our imagination to often times wonder what the character was thinking. In Carlito's Way we are offered a glimpse into that thought process, and it is quite rewarding indeed.Highly recommended. 8 out of 10",

Also, i really like Sean Penn, he had a supporting role in the movie too, and the combination of him and Al Pacino seemed fitting for this movie. It may be underrated, because it gets compared to Scarface a lot, Scarface is very different, since the story of Carlito's way is like an upside down plot of Scarface, in Scarface Tony Montana wants to be the greatest drug dealer in the world, here Carlito wants to completely cut himself out of the business and live a normal, happy life with his beloved woman. But as they say - you are married to the game. Once you are in, you are never getting out.Has some of the classic gangster/ crime movie gags, maybe with less violence, shows you that nobody can be trusted once it comes to business, money over everything etc. Nonetheless, if you like Al Pacino, this is a must watch, not saying it is his best performance ever, but it is decent enough!",

Otherwise I cant explain why this really magnificent film was most underrated.When I first saw this movie, I just knew that I want to see it again, immediately. I Saw it 3 Times in the theatre (a week interval between each other)and each time I was more and more convinced that this was the best film ever (I still think so 10 years after).What made me love this film so much is that it is much much better than its ingredients, which are praise for themselves. The story line is much complex, interesting and surprising than it sounds in the beginning. We know at the beginning how it ends, but the \"story telling\" is so delicious and thrilling that knowing the end just adds to our involvement with the protagonist. The acting of all the cast (Pacino, penn and Ann Miller, Guzman, Leugziamo and mortensen) is like Carlito says \"Top drawer\". The music scores and the seventies era illustrated in this film made me very nostalgic and allegic. The real hero of this film is De Palma. He seems to make this masterpiece effortlessly, combining great action and horror scenes (which he masters without a competition) with surprisingly tender and touching love scenes. It seems like he winks at us, as to say \"If I wanted to, I could have bit Coppola or Scorsese in their playground without sweat\"",

The question is: Could he make it...all the way to the happy end?Or a better question: Is it possible to make a gangster movie with a happy end?  The biggest credit in this movie goes to Al Pacino, who was after Scarface, once more brilliant. I can't imagine anyone else who could do his role. And beside him, there was talented and beautiful Penelope Ann Miller, who was also the perfect pick. All in all, there isn't any bad acting in this movie...especially the Italian and Mexican gangsters were convincing.\n Carlito's Way remains one of my top 10 choices. Why? Great acting, (before mentioned) love story, tense action, great scenography (70's style), strong characters, good music, and something undescribable.

            "content": "After the excessive indulgences of Scarface, it was with an air of scepticism that some people awaited this reunion of director Brian De Palma and star Al Pacino. Were we in for another overlong wallow in extreme violence and foul language? Or was this to be a more accomplished offering? As it turns out, Carlito's Way is far superior to Scarface - a Grade-A gangster flick with pace, violence, humour and even some genuinely moving moments of loss and tragedy. Pacino plays the main character Carlito Brigante, a former gangster freshly released from jail. He proudly tells the judge that he is a reformed man, determined to see out the rest of his life as a law-abiding citizen. No-one believes him, of course, but astonishingly Carlito is telling the truth: he really is finished with the life of crime. However, the fates conspire to drag him back into the lifestyle he hoped to leave behind. His nephew gets him involved in a bar-room shootout; his lawyer solicits his help in springing a Mob boss from jail; a prosecution attorney is constantly trying to pin various little discrepancies onto him; a young new-hood-on-the-block wants to challenge Carlito's tough guy mantle; and so on. In the end, despite his best efforts, Carlito is pretty soon up to his neck in crime and killing. The film is a wonderful piece of story-telling, with characters who really make sense and who go through believable and fascinating changes and experiences. Carlito grows into an admirable and honest guy, and his later involvement with the \"wrong\" people is all the more powerful because of this. There are plenty of De Palma's trademark set-pieces, including a hilarious opening courtroom scene, the terrific bar-room sequence in which Carlito does a pool trick-shot to divert the bad guys, and an absolutely hair-raising chase sequence at New York's Grand Central Station which may very well be the most exciting ten minutes of film ever shot. Oh yes, and did I mention Sean Penn's extraordinary performance as a lawyer-gone-bad?\n On the whole, Carlito's Way is a triumph.... one of the best films of the '90s.",

Tony was a rag to riches story while carlito stands on the complete opposite of the pole. Carlito a big timer, a figure who is known and after serving five years in prison, he wants to leave his past behind and to locate himself in a new location, away from all the crime. That the plot and being 145 minutes long, it good to enough to keep you hooked from start to finish.Al pacino does his typical gangster role but seeing that he delivers every time (past couple of years he been of his game )i have no problem seeing him act out the role. A huge amount of credit goes to him. While his past is kept secret, you know carlito has done so pretty bad things in his life, you know he used to be cold blooded killer not so long ago. but despite all this, you can't help but like him.I had mix feeling on the soundtrack. The club scenes, very familiar with Scarface, jointed well the songs but my worst gripe with it was during the Love scene. For a gangster film, i thought it was too corny.Another problem was with the final act. Nothing wrong with the cat and mouse scene, that was brilliant but it the fact that we all knew what was coming which ruined somewhat of the suspense for me. Plus, not to mention the predictable ending, in which, it was easy to know who was going to do it.Apart from that, this is a overall strong gangster film with fantastic acting. No doubt Al pacino made this role his own and with other strong actors such as Sean Penn staring, there not very much that could of gone wrong.",

            "content": "Carlito's Way came after Scent of a Woman, Glengarry Glen Ross, Frankie and Johnny and The Godfather, Part III,and it was Pacino's last movie before Heat.In \"Carlito \u0085\",the bearded Pacino gives a powerhouse performance as a thug who does not find his place in the milieu he finds after he is released from the prison;he decides to change some rules,and to play a little softer,and this will soon prove to be disastrous;as played by Pacino,the dealer Carlito is a likable character,in that trend of Pacino humanized gangsters that at some turn in their grim existence try to be a little more humane ;De Palma chose well Pacino,not only for his thug looks and streetwise aptitudes ,but also for his acting skills ,so Pacino makes full use of his testosterone fueled voice and explosive insults ,yet the role is quite restrained within the Pacino range, and without the insobriety of his famous mobster aqua-tints .Pacino's career is an alternation of very dissimilar movies.Carlito is another underworld role,after Johnny (from Frankie and Johnny), Michael Corleone, Big Boy Caprice, Tony Montana, Sonny Wortzik, and the primeval Bobby,in a string of roles that parallels De Niro's gallery. Carlito Brigante was followed by Lefty Ruggiero.Like Brando,like Newman, Clift and Gabin,and like most of the fascinating actors, Pacino had the mischance of working mostly with second-rate directors;anyway,Pacino was fortunate enough to meet,now and then,some cult directors like De Palma (Scarface and Carlito's Way) or Michael Mann (Heat and The Insider).As conception, \"Carlito \u0085\" is a melodramatic and beautiful thriller,a tale of love, baseness, loyalty and death in the suburb.The chase sequence is remarkably thrilling and well scored.Like Newman,like Brando,like Clift,Dean, Lemmon,Mastroianni, Gabin,Rourke and Marais, Pacino belongs to the class of the actors that it is a pleasure to simply watch in a movie,in any movie;it is obvious that these astonishing presences are not simply nature's gift ,but rather are the fruit of the artistic intelligence of these actors. By the way,Pacino admires Brando and Newman,and Rourke likes Brando,Newman and Pacino;another notable admirer of Newman is Willis. Unlike some of the aforementioned men, Pacino was always of an endearing ingenuity and directness in declaring his respect and affection for the actors' art. He never mocked acting, though the tradition of scorning and despising the acting profession is very respectable (Bogart, Gabin, Brando, Rourke, etc.). In \"Carlito \u0085\",Pacino's role is dense,robust and well conceived,it has gusto and the touches of exquisite exuberance .As usually,Pacino is himself better than the scripts he is offered;he creates depth where it would only be sociology and cheap melodrama .A script has to be very wrong (see People I Know),to be able to defeat even Pacino.After Carlito's Way (1993), De Palma broke off till the Mission: Impossible (1996), and Pacino, as I already mentioned,till the '95 Heat.I knew the suave Mrs. Penelope Ann Miller from Other People's Money (1991),Norman Jewison's quaint comedy;she also had roles in \"Miami Vice\",Miles from Home (1988),The Freshman (1990)(the wonderful Marlon Brando spoof),also in Awakenings (1990),Kindergarten Cop (1990),Chaplin (1992),Along Came a Spider (2001):a career that began by promising much (like those of Elizabeth McGovern and Lara Flynn Boyle).Slowly,Mrs. Penelope Ann Miller disappeared from the notable movies.Sean Penn manages to do a great role as the decomposing, viscous and disintegrating lawyer.David Kleinfeld is one of his few film roles in the first half of the '90s.Carlito's Way (1993)is a landmark in Pacino's movie career,and undeniably a good film,as a realistic foray into the offenders' territory.But the real stake of \"Carlito's ...\" surpasses this theme, passing into a character depiction.I will begin by declaring that the streetwise thrillers about the underworld are not my preference: guttersnipes, swindlers, crooks, evildoers, ragamuffins, fustian rascals, peculator, cads, rags, the society's lees, ruffians and miscreants.Carlito is a man who chooses to play different,against the rules of his social environment.How far can he go?The conclusion of this film may seem quite predictable:one cannot break the conventions of his world,the game's rules,his human range is decided beforehand by his social world that precedes him,and one's attempt to ignore this,to play slightly different,is quickly punished.Carlito tries to resume his life with a new set of rules;still,he can not reconcile these with the world that he finds outside the prison,because, unlike him,that world did not change.Hence, Carlito's conflict with his entourage,and his failure,as he strives to pave his way towards a quiet life with some lesser evils.In other words, Carlito chooses a compromise, a partial change,a convenient improvement:he is not transformed enough to be a honest man,but he is not willing to be as rough as his milieu demands it,either. Carlito's way is a compromise,a partial improvement.He is strong,tough,yes,but not powerful enough to change a game on his own.It can be noticed that De Palma does not illustrate a moral example ,and he does not speak about marvels and a conversion,with his Puerto-Rican streetwise character.Carlito is not William 'Rocky' Sullivan from Angels with Dirty Faces (1938),nor Frank T. Wells from F.T.W. (1994),John Sedley from Johnny Handsome (1989),etc.. Carlito tries,indeed,to be somewhat better,slightly better,but the moral nature of his improvement ,of his change,remains largely unknown. He has certain values (such as loyalty),and also he has aged.The discord with his hellish milieu will crush him,as he was not able to find his way out of that labyrinthine underworld.The knockout chase sequence,as I already mentioned before,with Brigante being pursued by the furious Italian mobsters,in the underground and airport ,is worthy of a deserving thriller.",

The screenplay was amazing in this movie, as it gives the movie a tone of darkness throughout the film without being full of in-your-face violence. The directing by Brian De Palma was outstanding, and the chase sequence in the train station had my complete attention all the way. The acting by Al Pacino was as good as always, and Sean Penn gave an excellent performance as the coke-headed lawyer-turned-wiseguy. It was also interesting to see Viggo Mortensen as the crippled Lalin.Another interesting thing about this movie is that along with re-uniting director and actor from Scarface, it also features some of the actors from Scarface in minor cameo appearances, such as Hector from Scarface appears as Rolando, who is the man smoking a cigar at the beginning of the movie, who doesn't believe that Carlito retired.A must see movie for fans of Pacino or De Palma 10/10",

The storyline is a little different than others, with Carlito (Pacino) legitimately attempting to go straight after a brief prison stint, but continually being dragged back into the business.The solid plot is supported by an excellent cast. Pacino is perfectly in his element, perhaps a version of Tony Montana who's had time to wise up. Sean Penn steals the show as his slimy lawyer/friend Kleinfeld. If you've played GTA Vice City, you know the character quite well. Penelope Ann Miller is very seductive as Carlito's long lost love. Also memorable is John Leguizamo's up-and-coming hothead. Viggo Mortensen takes the cake as a one-scene wonder, a wheelchair bound ex-gangster. Iin his short screen time gives by far the best performance of the movie.The end sequence is very harrowing, despite being one of those movies that shows the beginning first. Carlito gives periodical voiceovers, which are supposedly full of wisdom but just become tiresome after a while. They are perfectly reasonable introducing certain characters, but sometimes less is more.Carlito's Way isn't the best film of its genre, but it is plenty serviceable and very enjoyable.

In this one, which is also directed by Brian De Palma, he plays a Puerto Rican ex-con who gets lured back into his old criminal ways despite the protestations of his girlfriend, Penelope Ann Miller. And while Penelope is no Michelle Pfeiffer, Al is significantly better looking as Carlito than Tony, with his beautiful long locks and a nicely cropped beard.This is going to sound crazy, but bear with me: Carlito's Way is a really good date movie. Ladies, if you've done something wrong and are in the doghouse, suggest this movie to your boyfriend to get back in his good graces. It's a very manly movie, with tons of violence and a storyline about being a bigger bad guy than the other bad guy-but you can chuckle to yourself as he thinks you're being entirely selfless, since there are also tons of steamy scenes with a handsome leading man. Is the famous scene where Penelope takes her clothes off behind a locked door really for the guys in the audience? Or is it so the girls in the audience can see Al lose control and break the door down?You're going to have to take the good with the bad during Carlito's Way. The good is, obviously, Al Pacino. This is a classic, typical Al Pacino movie with a crime-ridden plot and lots of violence, so if you like his usual movies, you'll be happy with this one. The bad is a less-than-stellar heroine who's rather stupid and a heavily disguised yet incredibly annoying sidekick, Sean Penn. The rest of the supporting cast is pretty good, though, with Luis Guzman as a loyal crony, John Leguizamo as the rival gang leader, and a young Viggo Mortenson in a small role. If you're still on the fence, watch the preview. It's a very accurate representation of this '90s drama.DLM Warning: If you suffer from vertigo or dizzy spells, like my mom does, this movie might not be your friend. There are a few scenes, including the first and last during which the camera spins, and that will make you sick. In other words, \"Don't Look, Mom!\"Kiddy Warning: Obviously, you have control over your own children. However, due to language, violence, and sexual content, I wouldn't let my kids watch it.",

I love his more psychological thrillers with The Fury (1978) a personal favourite but there is something magical about his relationship with Al Pacino that seems to help this, and the earlier Scarface (1983) to reach another level. We are as involved with with his wavering romantic liaison as we are with the violent action and the camera seems to love his every move, whether walking along a New York street or wielding a cue in the pool room. I think the boat rescue scene is a bit of a weak moment and this might be because we simply do not particularly care about the protagonists at this stage. Apart fro this possible lapse, however, the movie is faultless, with absolutely wonderful dance and nightclub scenes, seemingly so difficult for many directors, and a hard enough edge to maintain the tension brilliantly.",

CARLITO'S WAY is one such film.Al Pacino is Carlito \"Charlie\" Brigante, a former Cuban-American cocaine dealer who has paid his debt to society and now wants to start his life over. Things are complicated, however, after Charlie inherits a lavish nightclub. Soon he finds himself challenged by his Cuban rivals, as well as by some murderous Mafia mobsters. His attempt at going straight is finally thwarted when his lawyer (Sean Penn) gets him involved in settling a few scores.Penelope Ann Miller costars as Charlie's devoted Anglo girlfriend, and John Leguizamo has a memorable villain's role. But the real star is Pacino, who holds the audience's interest until the very end. Despite being violent, amoral, and occasionally treacherous, Charlie is actually quite sympathetic as the hero. The movie follows his entire wild lifestyle as he juggles his public image, his waning friendship with his lawyer, and the love of his girlfriend.All that aside, the best part of the movie comes at the very end. Charlie, a marked man, is hunted through a subway station by several Italian-Americans who will kill him on sight. What results is a well-executed, suspenseful action sequence that actually involves relatively little bloodshed and is just as riveting as any street fight or shoot-out.CARLITO'S WAY contains the requisite gangster violence and a bit of sensuality, but aside from that it is a stylish, touching crime drama that should appeal to almost anyone.",

Suited for 12 years and older. Lots of violins, lots of worn out gangster cliches, but in the end \"Carlito's Way\" is still a nice old fashioned gangster story to pass the time with and dream away from the real world.Al Pacino ofcourse is the star that makes this movie shine bright, although he looks somewhat as a hairdresser with his tightly trimmed beard and shiny slick hairdo. That shiny and slick look suits the role he plays of a gangster who swore that he has retired from crime. Will he hold that promise when his criminal lawyer friend (Sean Penn) gets into trouble with the mob? Or will he be pulled back into the sewer of gangster violence?Direction is done well but very slick. Everything from editing, to soundtrack and photography is slick and shiny. That in itself isnt bad, because it creates a great looking gangster picture, but my only criticism would be that it is a bit too shiny and and a bit too romantically slick to be a real gangster movie.

            "content": "Based on novels by Edwin Torres, this heartfelt gangster flick makes for a fine sequel to Scarface - or at the very least a very welcome revisiting for Al Pacino and director Brian de Palma.David Koepp's script paints a picture of a mean New York, full of thuggish opportunists and snivelling cowards (Viggo Mortensen's slimy Lalin is a must-see for all Lord of the Rings fans wishing to see that actor's range). And at the centre of it all is Pacino's Puerto Rican Carlito: relocated, reinvigorated; reborn and going straight... or so he hopes.There's something undeniably tragic about Carlito's plight. It provides a lovely narrative goal; while lawyer and best friend David Kleinfeld (Sean Penn) wilfully digs his way into a violent criminal world, Carlito wants out - and he wants to bring his stripper girlfriend Gail (a miscast Penelope Ann Miller) with him. Oliver Stone's wickedly cynical script for Scarface described a conceited monster; it's easier to warm to this redeemed version: still artful and egotistic, and yet blessed - or, as it happens, cursed - with a shrouded sense of morality.The representation of the relationship between Carlito and Gail is mawkish, but it's worth remembering that this is a portrait of broad strokes. De Palma has never been a stranger to melodrama - in fact, he fairly relishes it. Here he draws a memorable performance from Sean Penn, while his framing and movement are as dynamic and assured as ever. The pace is pulsating; Pacino's anti-hero is effortlessly sharp and angry; Patrick Doyle's music is aptly melodramatic; and the final burst for freedom - an expertly-staged, fifteen minute foot chase sequence - is pure cinema.",

            "content": "Whether DiPalma likes it or not, the audience is entitled to think of this as the B-movie companion piece to \"Scarface\", since DiPalma is mapping the same terrain with assist from \"Scarface\" star Pacino once again playing an Hispanic mobster in the late 1970s. However, all the play-it-to-the-max ballsiness of the older film has been lost. And that the Pacino character here is a reformed mobster, much older and mellower than Scarface could ever hope to become, only excuses this in part - specifically, the sappy romanticism that finds its focus on the relationship between Carlito and Gail - which would be wholly unbelievable if this clearly weren't a B-movie to begin with, with all the plot-loops, stereotypes, \"message\" and daffy sentimentalism that implies.Still, even granting all this, there's a lot wrong here; That the Italians that show up at Carlito's club at the end all have names of the Family bosses of New York may have seemed witty when written, but unfortunately serious mob-watchers - and mob-movie watchers - may feel at first confused and then disappointed - the film seems to be playing for realism here, but it's only a joke after-all. Sean Penn starts the film at top form, but somewhere along the line decides it's not worth the effort, and he's almost right. Pacino himself seems to be running out of energy - his Spanish accent in \"Scarface\" was overdone, but was consistent with the character; here, he wanders into southern drawl, general Manhattanese, and 'Donnie Brasco' 'wop' (no offense, you know what I mean), trying to find some focus to his character that will explain his pulling punches while leaving him an edge. But he doesn't make it; Carlito feels like the wimp others think he's become. And when he needs his smarts most, they let him down - not just his smarts, but his actor, his director and his writer. Finally one has to remark the late '70s kitsch filling the background here. We saw this kitsch before, in \"Scarface\", where it played an important role in defining the emptiness of the culture Montana so desperately wants to dominate; here, it just floats around in the background, largely unfinished (those Afros! not every brother wore them in those days!), taking up space.But the real problem here is that a B-movie \"Scarface\" companion piece ought to be a distillation of the action episodes with some swift dialog to hold it together. This film is WAY too long and drawn-out. DiPalma used his slower moments in \"Scarface\" to give us rich set-pieces of humor and irony, like the cunnilingus-gesture pick-up scene, or the wildly gaudy room-sized bubble-bath scene. Here, the slow moments are filled with, well - talk; and if the talk were interesting, these would be bearable; but it's not, so they aren't.It's a well-made and watchable crime-story, but it not only pretends to more, it could have been more, much more; so it doesn't even get \"B\" for effort.",

Scorsese did it when he tried to practically remake \"GoodFellas\" with \"Casino\", Coppola did it when he made \"The Godfather Part III\", and De Palma did it when he made \"Carlito's Way\".\"Carlito's Way\" is the story of Carlito Brigante (Pacino), a street gangster who is acquitted of a thirty-year sentence after just five years thanks to his weaselly lawyer (Penn). He then tries to make a legitimate life for himself by running a nightclub, but ties to his old friends sucks him unwillingly back into the criminal underworld.The film is incredibly well made. De Palma has become a masterful director by 1993, and he showcases his full talent in \"Carlito's Way\". Every shot is thought-out and followed-through excellently, resulting in a film with perfect direction that maintains an extremely coherent visual feel throughout its 140+ minute running time.So why only a B+? Well, the fact is that \"Carlito's Way\" is just not very original. There are multitudes of gangster films out there, and sometimes it's just hard for one to stand out. Also, as I stated earlier, De Palma is repeating himself. An ethnic gangster...a nightclub...Al Pacino...a life of sex, drugs, and violence...any of this ring a bell? Any of this sound suspiciously similar to Scarface (1983)? But all that aside, \"Carlito's Way\" is still a well made, thoroughly enjoyable crime film, and really, anything Al Pacino is involved in most likely warrants at least a viewing or two.8/10",

This has to be one of the best Pacino movies ever and feels a lot more personal and more of a character study then De Palma and Pacino's earlier Scarface. We basically follow Carlito Brigante trying to go legit after leaving jail. His lawyer Kleinfeld (Penn) draws him to disaster after they kill a gangster. Benny Blanco, a punk Carlito dislikes eventually kills Carlito. He hooks up with old flame Gail and we later find her in a strip club, (cue nude scene)!

It seems his lawyer (Sean Penn) was able to get his case overturned on appeal.

All he wants to do is get a large nestegg and leave. But Carlito, despite his reputation, isn't especially bright. This is because following his release, he hangs out with the same people he used to know and yet he expects to somehow, despite this, stay clean.I liked and disliked this movie. On one hand, there is no one to root for in this film...they're all scum and idiots. I know a lot of folks like gangster films, but it didn't hit the mark for me but would have had they made Carlito more likable or relateable. But, oddly, on the other hand, I must hand it to Pacino, as his acting was really good here....far more subtle than I expected and far more subtle than you'd expect from one of his mobster movies. Also, while filled with profanity and vioence, the level of both was less than expected. Worth seeing if you love gangster films...but probably not among the best of them. However, on the positive side,...I REALLY liked how the film ended. It was close to perfection.",

He is going clean, he has a dream to move to Bahamas and rent cars to tourists. To do that he needs some money. He is set up by his friend and lawyer Kleinfeld to manage a disco. But no one really believes he is clean and the DA is out for him. Carlito struggles to keep clean and also rekindles his relationship with Gail, the woman of his dreams. But Kleinfled has some trouble with his mafia-clients and Carlito is a man that helps his friends. Even if it means trouble...Comments: First off, I believe this move could have been a lot better with just a simple adjustment. If it had not shown the ending at the beginning, the entire movie would have benefited. Now you know how it's going to end, right from the start. And its not too hard to figure out who either. Otherwise it is a well made movie, but it has its faults. For one, its very front heavy. By that I mean that it puts a lot of time to establish characters and the environment, and it almost seem like they panicked when it came to the ending, realizing they didn't have much time left to do it in. So the ending is simple, predictable and very short.The best part of the production is the acting. The entire cast gives a very strong performance with Pacino and Penn leading the way. Those two are exceptional. I also was impressed by Mortensen's short scene. But when the story is too slow, the acting matters less, unfortunately. So I can't rate higher than a (even though the acting almost deserves more)...6/10",

            "content": "There is a scene midway through the film that really exemplifies why I think it is so good almost purely because of the acting. Penn, in the shape of a sleazy, lowlife lawyer wants to persuade Pacino, Carlito (a reformed gangster) to help in a jailbreak. The dialogue is not that great. The direction is good, albeit not noteworthy. Yet, what really makes it so good is the chemistry, the talent of Penn and Pacino together - they make their characters just that much more memorable, that scene just that bit more inviting and engaging and the film instead of being an above average gangster flick into something quite brilliant.The story is quite simple really. Carlito, a former Puerta Rican bad-ass wants to make good and start up a legitimate franchise renting cars. He remains trapped by his criminal instincts, his whole social circle is entrenched in immorality. The world seems different now, Carlito is now older, he needs to find a way out of the New York underworld before it kills him. He rekindles an old romance in the hope of starting a new, normal life.The characters in this film are unforgettable, although not always armed with the best dialogue De Palma gives Penn, Pacino and the rest of the cast enough opportunity to shine. By no one does no one element in this film deliver. Kleinfeld, is not just another lawyer, thanks to Penn he is now a vulnerable, moody cocaine addict. Carlito, is not just a merciless criminal, he is also a sensitive, varied character. De Palma manages to create individuals and individual moments that really cannot be easily erased from memory. The set design, and set pieces are were De Palma really comes into his own. There are many brilliant scenes in the disco, in nightclubs, in New York Central Station that belong to De Palma's best work.De Palma avoids the more showy and gauche tendencies of his direction to give us a truly great character study. There are so many scenes that really stay with you for awhile thereafter and the ending, though maybe not unexpected will definitely have you thinking and asking - why doesn't De Palma produce something this good ever again?",

It's filled with many memorable scenes and characters, but ultimately it just can't pull them all together.Al Pacino plays Carlito Brigante. He's a mid-level Puerto Rican crime lord who has just been released from jail after serving only five years of a thirty-year sentence. Apparently a technicality and Carlito's brilliantly slimy lawyer (Sean Penn) have set him free early. Carlito sets out to raise $75,000 and move to Jamaica so he can buy his way into the car rental business. Yes, he plans on going legit. His slimy lawyer basically laughs in his face when he hears Carlito's plan. How can a man with such a violent past ever go legit, asks the conventional wisdom on the street. Carlito isn't out of jail more than a day or two before he's already involved in a violent shoot out and running a seedy nightclub for the money he needs. He tries his hardest, but it's no use. Not only does he have trouble avoiding his violent tendencies, but he's surrounded by thugs and low-life's (his lawyer in particular) that constantly bring him down. He hooks up with an old flame and asks her to come with him when he leaves the city. Of course she says yes, but with everyone after Carlito by the end of the film, will they make it out of New York alive? Unfortunately, that question is answered in the first five minutes of this film. Why the hell did they do this? Well, sometimes that technique works. Casino and Fight Club come to mind. But here.... I don't like it. That conclusion would have been a hell of a lot more convincing had we not seen it happen so soon. The film plays itself out fairly well to get us back to what we've already seen, but I just wish the film could have started out in the courtroom.Pacino is good, but not great. His accent needed a little work, and it comes and goes. Of course, he is talented enough to make any performance more than watchable. I'll lay it right on the line... Sean Penn walks away with this film. His scumbag lawyer character is one of the most unsavory creeps I've seen in a film in a long time. Penn's character is the embodiment of nearly everything that can be wrong with a person. He seems to revel in his character's sleaziness. Most of supporting actors are also very good. John Leguizamo shows definite promise in one of his earliest roles.Overall, it just wasn't as good as I'd hoped. The film shoots itself in the foot by showing the ending at the beginning. And also, there are way too many references to other De Palma films in this one. It's like every ten minutes he has to remind you of all the other films he's done.6 of 10 stars.The Hound.",

Too, it's the deeply written characters of the three mains, that make this pic work well. We really feel for the newly released Carlito (Pacino) evading a much six time longer sentence, owing it too much to scuzzy lawyer Kleinman (Penn), unsurpassable in this, bringing so much depth to a character, who just engrosses us from day one. It's a riveting performance with the fuzzy wuzzy, kind of Leo Sayer hair do. Pacino again brings another masterpiece of a performance, his way, like Carlito, who before his stint in prison, was the Puerto Rico bad arse drug lord. But here, he truly wants to go straight, trying to dodge the surrounding corrupt forces, trying to suck him back in, and won't foil his plan to make enough money, to take off with his reunited sweetheart Gail (Penelope Ann Miller, really sexy in this, and like Penn and Pacino, has a meaty character to work with. Carlito also has a real arch enemy lawyer, riding his tail, so wanting him back inside, where like one scene in it's starting, where Carlito theatrically, addresses the court, that makes a smarmy, with his victory, it's so much fun again where these two rivals, are back in the same room. The first dying scene, may'be we could of done without, as it would of been much more intriguingly suspenseful, especially nearing it's closing in a wonderfully orchestrated shootout scene, to see if Carlito was gonna beat em', but like we know in many other examples, that's rising a flimsy chance and desperate hope. Carlito's choices, about doing things his way, made sense to. The other shootout scene, much earlier, unconsciously for me, drew homage to the other but bloodier betrayal shootout + chainsaw slicing scene in the early part of Scarface. That's what it really felt like to me, in this reuniting of Pacino and De Palma reuniting pic, with a great beaty Cuban tune, accompanied. The script is really good, I must say, too, and Viggo Mortennsen's performance of a pathetic wheelchair bound ex con, Puerto Rican, who's wired up you could say, must claim mention. Also John Leguizamo as a new wannabe gangster, Benny Blanco, moving up, but not favored by Carlito, who reminds him of what he used to be, gives some of his best work, while truly creating a memorable bad mafia dude. C.W. is so enjoyable, it passes quite fast through it's 144 minute duration, but it's a film that must be seen, on all accounts.",

            "content": "What an underrated yet truly great film! The Brian De Palma-Martin Bregman-Al Pacino association sparks obvious comparisons to 1983's Scarface, their first collaboration - however 1993's CARLITO'S WAY is the richer film in so many important ways. It has so much subtext, emotion, delves far deeper into the mind and even the soul of its main character with the result that Carlito Brigante becomes someone you root for and care about - which was not necessarily true about Tony Montana, despite his gory end in \"Scarface\"...The name \"Brigante\" makes one who speaks French immediately think of \"brigand\" - a bandit from the gutter right there. The irony here is that it is the name of the reformed criminal and very much worthy human being that we wind up 100% behind in his hopeless quest for a brand new life... a future... and el paraiso.The romantic scenes were an oasis of bliss amidst the grisly world and tangled web that was weaving itself around Carlito as the movie unfolded (thanks to Carlito's crooked counselor but also, quite ironically too, thanks to Carlito's own willingness to reform and \"be good\"...) Verily, the romance with Gail (what a luminous -what else- performance by Penelope Ann Miller) is what humanizes this film. Whereas Scarface was soulless almost, cold and all about the underworld, this film has a soul and this romance is it. She is the angel who can lead the way to the dream of El Paraiso for Carlito - the sharpest contrast there could be; he dresses in black and she is blonde, with a porcelain complexion and ethereal almost! The problem is that she is not the only ethereal presence in the film, and the other one is a ghastly one that haunts him and will never go away until it destroys him. That ghost finds an eerie embodiment in \"Benny Blanco\" (another -of many reasons- to hate John Leguizamo; this role right here!) and Carlito will pay the price for sparing someone that could come back to haunt and hurt him... This unfortunate bit is my lone gripe against this masterpiece; but a happy ending would have cheapened this ode to the human frailty, probably...For, indeed, Carlito's Way has a message - and that message is that, no matter what we do, we cannot escape what we are - \"our way\"- and we are destined to follow the course of that until the end. No matter what our intentions are.The supporting cast is phenomenal here, Penelope Ann Miller and Sean Penn especially. Special mentions go to Luis Guzman and even one Viggo Mortensen, who is far from his Aragorn form here - which only proves that he has some range... He is no Pacino, but then again few are... or ever will be.Think of it: Al Pacino has played it all; here, he is the fallen one seeking redemption. And achieving it, though not in the happy ending formulaic way. This same splendid thespian has played the same type of role before - and none were quite alike! Each role has his unique feel and proper substance. Pacino even played the fallen angel who will never seek redemption and he was MORE than believable in that role as well! Truly, he is one of the GREAT ONES. And Penelope Ann Miller holds her own opposite this great thespian. Unlike what many have said, she was NOT miscast here. AT ALL. She hits every note she has to hit, in a truly luminous performance. I would say that she has the same attributes too; every role she undertakes, she gives it a new twist, even if only through some small, almost imperceptible nuances and nothing else, making it all, in the end, new and fresh. One has only to compare all of her previous roles - Gail is unique. And beautiful - not just to Carlito either. That old Joe Cocker song never found a better subject to \"give it life\" than this character right here.This film does leave us with a sad ending though - a lyrical one but one we were hoping not to see. Gail's fears and words come true in the end - and it is bitter irony to realize that we could have had the \"happy ending\" here only if Carlito had kept his \"way\" like it used to be - ruthless all the while through.",

The role Pacino was given in this works for him well as did his portrayal of \"Tony Montana\" in Scarface.It has some decent narration which accompanies the storyline throughout the film and your gripped from the very start it throws you in at the deep end and that's what makes it the movie it is.It's good fun to watch and Penn's performance as Carlito's lawyer is truly amazing., He plays the part like no one else could have and is an interesting watch throughout the development of the story. One of the many highlights of the movie!.It really is a unique film it's not gonna be like a lot of other movies you've seen which gives it that fresh feel it's something new and different to the usual hum drum that is Hollywood movies.Of course as with any movie there are things that could have made it better although not that many of them come to head at this moment. Which only further proves the brilliance of this movie.One for fans of DePalma , Pacino or Penn and anyone who wants a break from the usual rubbish that gets passed off as \"films\" these days.8/10",

The two main performances by Pacino and Penn are very good. Narrations don't always work well in movies and can come off as forced sometimes but this film benefits from narration because it adds to the experience Romantic chemistry between the Pacino and Penelope Ann Miller's character is so goodThe story is good and decent enough. There are many tense moments in this film and some very fantastic action sequences that will keep you on the edge of your seat.I highly recommend it to anyone who hasn't seen it yet.",

The white women couldn't have an affair with a Latino unless he forced himself on her as represented scene with the chain on her apartment door.

(R)De Palma reteams with Pacino for another gangland saga and manages to top \"Scarface\"; Pacino again plays a Latino gangster (Puerto Rican this time, instead of Cuban), but after a five-year prison stint, he actually wants to go straight--you know what they say about good intentions, though. Script by David Koepp (based on two Edwin Torres novels) is full of familiar scenes and types, and some of the dialogue could have used a punch-up (the final piece of narration from Pacino is hoary enough to earn laughs), but its basic tale of a reformed crook undone by an outdated code of honor is a solid one, and De Palma brings his usual flashy bag of tricks to make the cinematic qualities jump off the screen. Pacino is an arresting screen presence (as expected), though he seems to be wavering between his sybaritic \"Scarface\" thug and his cantankerous \"Scent of a Woman\" colonel; Penn, nearly unrecognizable as his sleazy cokehead lawyer, is even more exuberant, a dangerous high-wire act of a performance; Miller, sexy but vulnerable, brings more to the \"gangster moll\" role than most others before her. The climactic chase starting at a nightclub and ending up in Grand Central Station is a virtuoso piece of filmmaking, but the suspense is diluted because the audience already knows the outcome from the opening credits!78/100",

Sean Penn is also excellent, as is every other member of the cast including one of my favourite actors, John Leguizamo. His character, Benny, adds a little bit more to the works. The story is intriguing too. Hard ass gangster, Carlito tries to give up life on the street but his so called best friend and lawyer, keeps pulling him back down. His relationship with his ex girlfriend is nice and steady, and you get a real sense of their love for one another. Watch Carlito's Way because it is one of the greatest gangster films in movie history. Rating=5/5",

            "review_title": "Enthralling film from De Palma, with just a touch of the 'seen it before's...",
            "content": "With \"Carlito's Way\"; De Palma has crafted the second gangster opus of his career, after '83's (?) \"Scarface\" remake.  Both films introduce us to the minutaie of the life of an immigrant criminal, and the dealings he has with others.  The difference is, in \"Carlito's Way\", said 'gangster' is determined to go straight...   As I said at the start of this review; both films are great and deserve to be seen.  Which is better?  I will always prefer \"Scarface\", because it was made before Pacino REALLY got typecast into playing mobster-types; and the fact is, watching somebody go into a downward spiral makes for better entertainment than watching them try and keep to the straight and narrow does.   In truth though, it's not really the comparisons to its 'cousin' that hurt \"Carlito's Way\", more its similarities to every gangster film made before or since.  Perhaps it's unfair to criticise a movie for having had such a big influence, but despite the best efforts of the cast, what I was watching never felt fresh.  It was even - dare I say it? - slightly predictable.  The best part of the movie for me were the scenes between Pacino and Leguizamo; the latter playing the scuzzball pretender to Carlito's throne.   It was good to see Penn back onscreen again too, but I felt that his role was perhaps hyped up more than it deserved.  The film takes its darn sweet time to get to the crux of the story, and in a way that's good, because we get to know the characters intimately.  However, it also means that the thrust of the movie is somewhat lacking, meaning that it doesn't quite have the intensity of a \"Donnie Brasco\" or a \"Godfather\"   All this criticism may give the impression that I don't like the film. Not true.  The problems I've pointed out just serve to highlight how I feel the film could've been made better than it already is.  Even unchanged, it's still miles better than 90% of the stuff you'll see at the cinema today. \n   What you should really take away from my review is this thought: If \"Carlito's Way\" were the first gangster film you had seen, you'd be hailing it as a masterpiece.  It very nearly IS just that, but I felt that it didn't possess the 'hook' to make it legendary.  This is sort of 'Scarface in reverse' then, so if you loved De Palma's earlier effort and feel you want some more of the same, then you're onto a winner.  I love both, but \"Scarface\" has the edge.  Whichever way you look at it, De Palma has now managed to make TWO great gangster films in his career, and some directors can't even manage to make one.  A great film, especially if you get the tape where it's back-to-back with \"Sea of Love\", like I did!",

            "review_title": "A somewhat overlooked gem from de Palma & Pacino",
            "content": "When it comes to crime dramas starring Al Pacino and directed by Brian de Palma, the first film that naturally comes to mind is \"Scarface\". Released in 1983, \"Scarface\" is arguably the definitive gangster movie of the 80's, so the attention that it gets isn't undeserved. However, what a lot of people don't know (or have forgotten) is that de Palma & Pacino teamed up again ten years later for a markedly different gangster movie.\"Carlito's Way\" features a more world-weary Pacino as a recently released convict who just wants to put his past behind him and fly straight long enough to retire to a comfortable but not extravagant lifestyle. Unfortunately, it isn't long before his acquaintances drag him back into the world of crime. Reluctantly bound by loyalty, Carlito's carefully laid plans start to unravel and it seems that he'll be lucky just to get out alive.In the lead role we have Al Pacino, just one year removed from his long-overdue Best Actor Oscar win for \"Scent of a Woman\". He shows some bluster in the opening courthouse scene but, for the most part, his performance is nicely subdued. Pacino serves as the film's anchor and much of its success is directly attributable to him. That being said, there are a few standout performances in support, most notably Sean Penn's uncharacteristic portrayal of Carlito's lawyer and close friend, Dave Kleinfeld. Penn got a Golden Globe nomination for his efforts and so did Penelope Ann Miller as the romantic interest, though I found her to be a bit of a weak link. Meanwhile, John Leguizamo stole some scenes in a smaller role and Viggo Mortensen made a memorable appearance as well.As you might expect, de Palma's direction is expertly handled, particularly when it comes to the showstopping chase scene that occurs late in the movie. Although not as flashy as \"Scarface\", there are some nicely executed artistic flourishes from time to time. In fact, the movie has nice production values from top to bottom, so it's a bit surprising that it got a lukewarm critical reception at the time of its release.Despite the movie's initial tepid response it has endured to become a cult classic. It will probably always be overshadowed by \"Scarface\" but it's a worthy gangster movie that's more thoughtful than most of its brethren. I will say, though, that the way the movie starts at (or, rather, near) the end and flashes back seems like it would rob the movie of some of its suspense. In retrospect, I see what the filmmakers had in mind but I wonder what first time viewers will think of it.",

I used to think that Brian's only saving grace was Scarface, but Carlito's Way is even better. And I think even more of Pacino now. Want to see Luis Guzman in something early? You got him. Penelope Ann Miller? You got her. A bunch of serious hardass Italians that make The Sopranos look like a team from the Laugh-a-Lympics? You're covered. Sean Penn, as good as ever? Checkaroonie.It's a movie about Carlito Brigante, a con released from prison on a technicality, who tries as hard as he can to go straight. His friends aren't straight, his old neighborhood isn't straight, and surely his reputation is anything but straight. He tries really hard, and this is a tense movie, but it's also a beautiful movie.

Calm like and old and mature man and mean just in the right scene. Nothing over the top and mostly natural.Sean Penn did a great job, but still... a little more irony in his role have would give the character a spin up.Good job for Penelope as well in the role of the Al Pacino so long lover, caring and loving.About the Director of photography I agree with the idea of the big screen shot but some close up were a little \"too much\", better If they would have been left out in my opinion.Music... right for the genre, but sometimes it just didn't fit in, I guess something more could have be done on it as well, for instance, nothing comparing with the \"taxi driver\" soundtrack.So for a movie that pre load the Pulp Fiction break out, GOOD JOB! 8/10 is fare enough.",

We have a script that tells the ending, and then shows the story, is an interesting resource, and is applied wrapped in many techniques, such as the mixture of PB with color, the camera ripple and the narration, is a moment almost the part of Of the film, after this moment we see in fact the trajectory of Carlito 'Charlie' Brigante (Al Pacino), the gangster who is taken out of jail, back in the streets, and all he wants is redemption and live the rest of his life away from Streets with his beloved, but ends up wrapped in the problems of his friend and lawyer David Kleinfeld (Sean Penn). \"Carlitos Way\" is a film that talks about redemption, Carlitos really is trying to change and believes that he can change, until he reaches the point where he accepts his destiny, it is a lyrical love story that has as background the Mafia, Murders, traffic and crimes, we see the love of friendship, loyalty and the special person, and how the relationship between them works, is an interesting and very well-adapted story. Even often using ex-machine features, Brian holds and strings his script convincingly giving Carlito a look of a Tony Montana mixed to Eliot Ness. Brian de Palm is a very accurate guy in the technique of his films, he knows how to work the camera very well, and here it is no different, he makes the viewer a compliment, we have a little camera used in tripod, that walks, Zoom, opens the frame and especially, is always in the right place in moments of tension, even some plans of the film are very simple, in the directional aspect, Brian does not miss, the movie sometimes reminds the great \"Scarface\", perhaps the scenes Of nightclub, but the photograph, she is different, she is gray and more suburban, aligned to a punctual trail that always pulls to a suspense. Al Pacino and his beard fill the screen always, even if his acting is not brilliant, Al Pacino has a masterful grandeur, it is impossible to take his eyes off him and not feel intimate for his character, Sean Penn is also very well in his moments, First a centered lawyer and then a mobster who hates gangsters, Penelope Ann and her almost angelic beauty is also wonderful, and contrasts even physically with Carlito's character making the viewer cling more to the couple in that air of \"Forbidden Love.\" \"Carlitos Way\" is among the best works of Brian De Palma for his subtlety and because he can keep a footprint and lead to the end without making the film coarse or boring.",

Look at De Niro in the past 10 years who`s appeared in some absolute crap like WE`RE NO ANGELS ,  THE FAN , and MEET THE PARENTS which leads me to believe that the star of TAXI DRIVER and RAGING BULL must be another actor called Robert De Niro . Pacino can never to accused of slumming it , and you know you`ll always be guaranteed an intense performance from him . Boy does Pacino give it 100% here. Amazingly Pacino didn`t even receive an Oscar nomination for this which is the best performance by an American actor from that year ( So much better than Tom Hanks ) , and he`s ably supported by Luiz Guzman and Viggo Mortensen and proving perhaps for the first time what an accomplished actor he is Sean Penn who was also strangely snubbed at the Oscar nominations . The only failure on the acting front is Penelope Ann Miller who plays the love interest",

            "content": "This quote from the film's third act could easily be the tagline for Carlito's Way, one of my favourite films and even a possible contender for my top 10 of all time. It tells the story of Carlito Brigante, a former criminal on early release, and his attempts to leave his past life, despite pretty much everyone around him dragging him back.It's only natural to draw comparisons between this and Scarface, both are crime movies directed by Brian DePalma and starring Al Pacino and in some ways the automatic comparison might be what has hindered this films popularity. Scarface is the more iconic and quotable film (and rightly so) but for my money Carlito's Way is the better film overall;\u00a0a more mature and contemplative piece.\u00a0There's a scene in a diner about mid-way through the movie in which Carlito tells Gail\"This counsellor in Lewisburg, Mr. Seawald, once said to me: \"Charlie, you run out of steam. You can't sprint all the way. You gotta stop sometime. You can't buck it forever. It catches up to you. It gets you. You don't get reformed, you just run out of wind.\"\"This felt almost like a direct acknowledgement of Scarface and how this film would differ from it;\u00a0Tony Montana in Scarface is clearly a character who tried to sprint all the way and ultimately paid for it.\u00a0Carlito's lived to be older than Montana, he's more world-weary and experienced. In some ways Carlito's Way benefits from the fact Scarface came before it. Montana was petulant, he lived fast and died young. Now DePalma and Pacino present us with a different story, one that takes its time and carries the weight of experience and of maturity.There's several instances where Carlito shrugs off something that would've outraged Montano. Clearly Carlito's the more relaxed of the two, more comfortable in his own skin and less likely to cause a stir when it's unnecessary. Carlito seems tired of who he was in his youth and so he tries to do something different.The main problem with this plan, and the main conflict of the film, is that his departure from who he used to be is far from a clean break. He takes what he tells himself is a temporary job, running a nightclub populated by criminals, many of whom knew him when he was younger or are familiar with his legend. In other words: bad influences. Carlito makes the potentially fatal mistake of trying to be both a semi-gangster and a reformed citizen simultaneously and the end result was always going to be problematic.This very interesting dimension of DePalma's film is brought to the forefront by the character of Benny Blanco, an up-and-coming criminal who Carlito takes a strong dislike to despite the fact a friend tells him\u00a0\"It doesn't make sense you should hate this guy because this guy is you twenty years ago.\"\u00a0He's essentially the physical manifestation of Carlito's younger self. When Carlito compromises on his no-crime promise and runs the nightclub, Benny is often lurking in the background. He represents Carlito's old life and Carlito now represents the new life he wants, it's only natural conflict should arise between the two. This external conflict between them matches the internal conflict between the two forces inside Carlito. Because he doesn't completely eradicate his younger avatar and instead keeps him around, the past (Benny) ultimately throws the future (Carlito) into severe jeopardy.\u00a0When Carlito throws Benny out of the club, the two stand illuminated by red light. Blanco's whole face is covered in it; he's fully a gangster, totally at ease with what he is with no internal struggle to rectify. Carlito only has red light on one half of his face, divided exactly in the middle. He's not quite a gangster anymore but he can't quite fully leave it behind. It's this internal struggle that causes so many problems for him.There's also themes about growing older and hopes being dashed. There's a great scene where Carlito goes to see his former girlfriend who he still has feelings for. She tells him she's a dancer, yet, when he goes to see her perform, it turns out she's a stripper. Pacino plays it brilliantly, keyword: nuance. Up until that moment he had thought Gail had achieved her lifelong dream and yet instead he sees it's simply a pale imitation (a storyline that parallels his own).\u00a0He has his shirt buttoned up to the top but when he enters the club and sees what kind of place it is he unbuttons his top button, adjusting his expectations (as well\u00a0as demonstrating how easily he can oscillate between the two worlds when really he should stick to one). It's a film about the perceived necessity of compromise but also the dark ramifications of it.The dialogue, and Pacino's delivery, can feel a little cheesy occasionally but, if you let yourself enjoy the film and be invested in the characters, that won't be a problem.Slow in parts, but never boring, when the action scenes arrive they're some of the best you'll see in film (Particularly the chase sequence). DePalma uses long shots for the chase scenes rather than the more traditional quick, excessive jump cuts and the end result proves to be very effective, giving a real sense of peril.\u00a0IMDb only allows 1,000 words so I can only briefly praise Sean Penn's fantastically seedy character and the excellent soundtrack.Overall, it's an interesting story, exploring a dimension of criminal life that's rarely been explored (and rarer still been explored this effectively). The tragedy of this film is that Carlito just can't shake off his former life, his compromises end with him getting in his own way, which makes for a more human story, even a more relatable one.\u00a0One of Pacino's best films and the best DePalma film I've seen so far. Great for fans of cinema, directing and characterization.9/10",

Though not a sequel to the first film, Carlito's Way puts together a good story all its own. The story-plot is similar to \"King of NY\", as a big name gangster returns to the streets after lengthy incarceration, balancing the police on one side and the underworld on the other. But that is where the similarity ends. Pacino plays Carlito Brigante, a \"reformed\" Puerto Rican hood just released from prison in 1975. He gets a second chance at life but soon becomes tangled in a tragic web spun by his previous reputation and one fatal decision. The movie has plenty of familiar faces; Sean Penn, Luis Guzman, Penelope A. Miller, John Leguizamo... This is one of those movies I instantly fell in love with after watching it for the first time back in '93. Carlito's Way is a solid film worth multiple viewings.",

            "content": "Carlito's Way is an Excellent and stylish Gangster classic that is filled with great direction,amazing acting,a wonderful script and a fantastic score and soundtrack. All of those combinations make Carlito's Way one of the greatest Gangster Films ever made and is Brian De Palma,Al Pacino and Sean Penn at their best.Based on the novels Carlito's Way and After Hours by Edwin Torres and set in New York City in 1975,Carlito's Way tells the story Carlito Brigante,(Al Pacino)a former drug dealer who after five years in prison has been released. While out of prison,Carlito wants to go straight and get out of the business and rekindle a relationship with his former girlfriend Gale(Penelope Ann Miller). But Carlito's efforts to go straight are interrupted when corrupt lawyer and friend Dave Kleinfeld(Sean Penn)as well as other associates and enemies who are trying bring Carlito back into his criminal lifestyle. Will Carlito keep trying to go straight and start a new life or go back to his old criminal life?Released in 1993,Carlito's Way did decent business at the Box Office but surprising received a lukewarm to mixed reception by film critics some of the criticisms was that Carlito's Way was too similar to the other Brian De Palma-Al Pacino Gangster classic Scarface. But overtime Carlito's Way gained a Cult Following thanks to Home Video and many television showings and is now seen as a one of the best Gangster films of all time and the praise is well deserved. Carlito's Way is Gangster classic that is amazing from beginning to end because while the storyline of Carlito's Way has been done before(i.e ex-convict trying to go straight)director Brian De Palma and Al Pacino bring something unique and creative to the film giving viewers a movie that is stylish and powerful,dark and tragic,romantic and beautiful as well as intense and thrilling. CW is a Film that is also rooted in the style and tradition of Film Noir with the gangsters,criminals and thugs are vicious and follow the rules and codes of the streets and the tone of the movie is gritty and dark. CW is also a Film Noir with the narration of the main character Carlito because with the narration we as the viewer are pulled into Carlito's mind and thoughts which are done almost like quiet whispers that are haunting and talks about the past and the present. While Carlito's Way is a Gangster film,De Palma has time to put in a few exciting and thrilling Action and Suspense sequences. De Palma knows how to film Action,suspense and thrills and De Palma is at the top of his game with CW because with each Action scene there is a great build up and a satisfying payoff and with Action scene there is attention to detail as well as amazing timing. The most memorable and explosive Action scene is the train station chase sequence which is directed like an Alfred Hitchcock scene and will also remind viewers of De Palma's classic train station scene in The Untouchables and if you loved the train station scene in The Untouchables you will the train station scene in this film. The character Carlito Brigante is great character because he is complex and has great depth and you will relate to him in wanting to go straight despite all of the things going on around him and we as the viewers are rooting for him to succeed and start a new life. While wanting to go straight Carlito still follows the rules of the streets but Carlito also follows his own rules and as you watch Carlito's Way you will see Carlito make great attempts to stay out of his old criminal life and while some of his friends and associates are trying make him go back to his old ways which makes Carlito sympathetic and tragic. The screenplay by David Koepp is fantastic and memorable,with Koepp giving the characters dialog that is gritty and tough matching the tone of the film. The ending of Carlito's Way is amazing.powerful and sad but it adds to the greatness and tragic feel of the movie. A powerful ending.The whole cast is great. Al Pacino is excellent and at his best as Carlito,with Pacino bringing grittiness,depth and intensity to the role. Sean Penn is brilliant as Kleinfeld,Carlito's friend and lawyer with. Penelope Ann Miller is terrific and beautiful as Gale,Carlito's girlfriend and love interest. John Leguizamo is fantastic as Benny Blanco,a hood from the Bronx. Ingrid Rogers is wonderful and sexy as Steffie,a club girl. Luis Guzman is outstanding as Pachanga,an old associate of Carlito's. Viggo Mortensen is great as Lalin,an old friend of Carlito's.The direction by Brian De Palma is brilliant and stylish,with De Palma always moving the camera bringing his usual visual style and tone to the film with zooms,close-ups with tracking and over head shots. Great direction,De Palma.The score by Patrick Doyle is amazing,powerful,tragic and intense matching every important scene in the movie. Terrific score,Doyle. The film also has a great soundtrack with songs by The Bee Gees(You Should Be Dancing),The O'Jays(I Love Music,Back Stabbers),KC & The Sunshine Band(Shake Shake Shake)Shake Your Booty,That's The Way(I Like It),LaBelle(Lady Marmalade),Joe Cocker(You Are So Beautiful),The Hues Corporation(Rock The Boat),Cheryl Lynn(Got To Be Real),Santana(Oye Como Va),Ed Terry(Disco Inferno,Rock Your Baby), and more. In final word,if you love Gangster Films,Crime Dramas,Brian De Palma,Al Pacino,Sean Penn or films in general,I highly suggest you see Carlito's Way.an excellent and stylish Gangster classic that is Brian De Palma,Al Pacino and Sean Penn at their best. Highly Recommended. 10/10.",

De Palma as usual devotes most of his attention and talent to the action set-pieces (especially the joltingly violent pool-room shoot-out and the tour-de-force chase sequence through Grand Central Station), not saving much for the sometimes very lazily handled bits that go in between, but gangster aficionados won't care about that.\nTell you how good a movie this is: when Carlito Brigante got whacked in the final scene, the girl sitting next to me in the cinema gasped \"Oh, no!\" and nearly started crying. Not the most sophisticated reaction in the world, but a more telling guide to a film's powers of emotional engagement than 100 blase reviews in the New Yorker.

            "content": "\"Sprung from prison on a legal technicality by his cocaine-addled attorney (Sean Penn), former drug kingpin Carlito Brigante (Al Pacino) stuns the local underworld by vowing to go straight. Dedicated to making a change, he reunites with his former girlfriend (Penelope Ann Miller) and rekindles their romance. But his dream of a legitimate life is undermined at every turn by ruthless former associates and even deadlier young thugs like Benny Blanco (John Leguizamo), who are out to make a name for themselves,\" according to the DVD sleeve's synopsis.\"Despite good intentions, Carlito's misguided loyalties and outmoded code of 'honor' plunge him into a savage life-or-death battle against the relentless forces that refuse to let him go in this powerful crime saga.\" Well-produced, and directed in style by Brian De Palma, \"Carlito's Way\" doesn't quite reach the heights of Mr. Pacino and De Palma's predecessors; but, it's a damn good attempt. The film is nicely set in disco-fied 1975 New York. It's nice to see Michael Hadge out of the Blue Whale tavern. Carlito's \"Mo-Rican\" narration does not impress (accents don't match); and, there isn't much innovative or suspenseful going on.Mr. Penn (as David \"Dave\" Kleinfeld) is very impressive; his sleazy coke-sniffing shyster, with the Art Garfunkel-styled hair, should have been considered for a \"Best Supporting Actor\" Oscar. There are several other memorable characters, like John Leguizamo, who introduces himself with alliteration, as \"Benny Blanco from the Bronx.\" Appearing topless, Ms. Miller (as Gail) is definitely arousing (it's okay, she plays a stripper). De Palma's ending climax is very exciting; and, you can play it for you mom, next time she asks, \"What is this, Grand Central Station?\" ******* Carlito's Way (11/10/93) Brian De Palma ~ Al Pacino, Sean Penn, Penelope Ann Miller, John Leguizamo",

            "content": "Right from the start this film looked promising and it sure was all the way through to the end. It is predictable that whatever Al Pacino stars in is going to be a masterpiece of some sort. Carlito's Way is another one of his masterpiece and what's even better is that Sean Penn costars and Brian De Palma directs this film as well. The beginning makes no sense at all but right from that moment as Al's character voice overs it just gives you a good masterpiece sort of feeling. Everyone should be grateful and privileged that they are seeing one of the best movies ever made. The dialog is fine and the story is interesting while some of the action scenes are smart and cool. Al Pacino is the best actor in this whole film because without him this film would be junk and should be avoided at all costs but thankfully Brian De Palma casted him. Sean Penn was good as well but his appearance looked hideous and made him look like a complete retarded lawyer. To put a long story short: Sean Penn could not give a better performance than Al Pacino. The real credit goes to the director, Brian De Palma. for creating this and without him all would be lost and watching this movie would be a waste of time. F*ck the Golden Globes for not giving Carlito's Way an award because this film is as good as Scarface and Good Fellas. The music is this film is pretty explosive and it really captures you at the end fight scene.Carlito, a Puerto-Rican drug boss, is out prison after serving five years all thanks to his lawyer friend David Klienfeld. He vows to stop his past from landing him in jail again but trouble starts following him and young druggies want to make a name for themselves. He becomes embroiled in something dangerous even for him and when things go bad he has to run away from some enemies. His old girlfriend gets back with him and together they have to make it out alive. A trail of deception always follows him. Cops and killers will be after him and he has to outwit them all and save himself.This film is not like how Scarface was, all blood and guts with no story, but this film is unique because it offers a great potential story with minimum amount of gore. You have to watch out for the fight sequences because they will blow you away and I mean really blow you away. This film does have flaws and one of them is the bad acting from Viggo Mortensen and he sucked bad because he didn't look like a gangster at all. Guess he was still a rookie back then. The other big flaw is Al Pacino's Puerto Rican accent which fails him completely to where he was born: America or Puerto Rico. Overall, this film doesn't disappoint but many people will be disappointed because this film tells the end before the beginning and they are right that it ruins the point of the film. Everyone should have a good time even though if it is a little bit slow or boring but wait until the end. Please! If you liked this film, I also recommend Good Fellas, Scarface, Casino, American Gangster, and Death Sentence.",

This 1993 Crime-Drama, offers some really gripping & well-written moments, that truly hold your attention. Even the Direction is perfect, and the Performances are first-class. If there something missing here, it's clearly it's popularity. Al Pacino stars Carlito Brigante, A Puerto-Rican ex-con, just released from prison, who, pledges to stay away from drugs and violence despite the pressure around him, and lead on to a better life outside of NYC. It's his journey. Carlito Brigante is an interesting person to lead 'Carlito's Way'. His journey comes in-tact with strong violence, usage of drugs & blunt honesty. And cinematically, you try to understand Carlito, in this never-ending journey he has taken. It's a character, who despite a choosing a side, will again have to go the way, he just had left. It's a complicated, yet sympathetic character. David Koepp's Adapted Screenplay is mostly arresting & gripping. However, the culmination comes across as half-baked. It leaves you in mixed emotions and even the impact is missing. Brian De Palma's Direction is perfect. He handles the story of this one-person, with utmost patience & understanding. Cinematography is neat. Editing & Art Design, are satisfactory. Performance-Wise: Pacino gives Carlito Brigante, a soul, with his match-less performance here. Sean Penn is terrific. He stands out. Penelope Ann Miller is impressive. John Leguizamo does well. Jorge Porcel & James Rebhorn lend good support. On the whole, An Under-Rated Crime-Drama, That Deserves A Watch.",

            "content": "Brian De Palma's Carlito's Way is like a 90's version of his 80's cult classic Scarface (1983). Both star Al Pacino as the lead character who is a gangster from an ethnic minority group. Unlike Tony Montana, however, Carlito Brigante is tired of his life of crime and wants a way out. He is a former drug dealing gangster who tries to escape his past after being released early from jail on a technicality. He re-starts a relationship with a stripper who tries to keep him on the straight and narrow, while at the same time his sleazy lawyer slowly drags him back into crime. The action revolves around the Puerto Rican criminal underground in 70's New York.The film benefits from De Palma's stylised and technically accomplished direction, with some bravura set-pieces including a well-staged shoot-out in a pool hall and a pursuit scene in Grand Central Station which includes a highly impressive long single-take mobile camera shot. The film also benefits from fine acting from its two leads. Al Pacino gives a very measured performance as Carlito, a character with a lot more to him than gangster bravado, while Sean Penn may be even better as Dave Kleinfeld the sleazy lawyer; Penn also has to be given special mention for donning a truly eye-poppingly repulsive wig throughout \u2013 now that is what I call suffering for your art! The disco era period detail is well delivered and adds another welcome aspect. If I had to criticise it would be to say that it is probably a bit overlong and could surely have told this story in a slightly more concise manner.

            "review_title": "\"I know a Puerto Rican when I see one\" -- Chris Rock",
            "content": "I'm shocked to see this film so well-reviewed, but seeing all the thumbs up on this site I do have to acknowledge the good points in \"Carlito's Way\". It's true that Pacino and Penn are two of the best American film actors ever, and their work in this film, as well as DePalma's effort as Director, does deserve praise. Latter day fans of the actors, or fans of Scarface, will see something of a reversal for Penn and Pacino - Pacino is simmering and reserved (complicated in a word, like many of Penn's pre- and post- \"Fast Times\" roles), and Penn is the bombastic psycho, a la Pacino's Tony Montana. And DePalma shows his technical and visual expertise, and deft handling of underlying violence, tension, and suspense, in many of the scenes mentioned in other reviews.But part of the reason the three principals here merit some applause, is that the script for this film is awful. It is paint-by-numbers without a shred of humor or irony. Pacino's \"Puerto Rican\" accent is unbelievably bad, as if he were mocking his own role, or if the text of the script were so bad he felt a need to mangle his own delivery. It's even worse than his Cuban accent in Scarface, without the cartoonish humor. Tony Montana couldn't even speak his few Spanish lines convincingly. Carlito sounds like a Cajun with bad gas, not a Puertorrique\u00f1o. Also, while I agree with other reviewers that Pacino's physical look in this film makes a big contribution (Penn's even more so), I have never met a Puerto Rican who looked as white as Pacino. Rick Aviles is Puerto Rican. John Leguizamo is half Puerto Rican. Pacino? Not remotely.This flaw is made worse by Pacino's voice over narration - one of my least favorite devices in cinema. The narration is so horribly written, it must have been added after the original cut. On occasion, narration is thus added to a completed film as an afterthought, where the original cut otherwise might seem confusing or incomplete, or to novel adaptations (like this one), to make up for the lack of illuminating backstory or detail. In \"Carlito's Way\", it's simply unnecessary and annoying. The film would have been shorter and better without it. I also agree with other reviewers that the very \"True\" romance between Pacino and Penelope Ann Miller is a departure from other Pacino gangster films, where his character is too unflappable or monomaniacal to be involved in and motivated by any such relationship. And the premise of two lovers who have been tragically separated - and shed some of their narcissism in the process - is compelling. But the pair's actual performances as lovers are childish and irritating. I agree with an earlier review here that the mock rape scene is so ridiculous that it's a chore simply to sit through it.To sum up, the whole cast and the director are excellent, but the script is garbage. Such a combo worked a lot better in \"King of New York\", a far less ambitious film, but one that is more watchable than this one because it sticks to its strengths.",

I rarely like Sean Penn but this was one of the few roles that even I have to admit he did a great job on. I'm sorry but \u00c1ngel Salazar is a pimp and anyone who says otherwise doesn't know what they're talking about. I'm just kidding but that little guy is just so awesome, he was in \"Scarface\" too and all the girls think he's adorable. If I was a director I'd throw him in so many more movies like he deserves. Also props to Luis Guzman as Pachanga, he is seriously one of the ugliest actors out there and to make it big looking like that I have to give my hats off to him as he is a fabulous actor and deserves all of it.

            "review_title": "The Tragedy of Carlito Brigante ...",
            "content": "1993 was a very interesting year for gangster films, Robert De Niro and Al Pacino, the veteran (always rivaled) actors who define the genre like the Cagney and Robinson of their generation, starred in two films that are, in my opinion, pivotal in the evolution of the gangster genre, respectively \"A Bronx Tale\" and \"Carlito's Way\". These two films are less similar in their method than the overall approach which tends to depict the gangster lifestyle with the same seductive/destructive dimension than other classics, transcended by a psychological dimension. Whether it's between crime and family or crime and honesty, the main characters suffer from an intolerable contradiction, their souls are like trees whose branches try to reach the sky of a honest and decent life, while the roots are already poisoned by the devil.Al Pacino never collaborated with Scorsese but there's something very Scorsesian in Carlito's character, a man of principles, lured into his own demons while trying to defeat them. Carlito is surrounded by many characters who all sin by naivety or treachery, on the top of them, his lawyer, the crooked Kleinsfeld, Sean Penn in a performance that should have earned him an Oscar nomination for Best Supporting Role. The only oasis of purity in this ugly setting is Gail (Penelop Ann Miller) the woman he loved before and still love after jail. Things have changed for worse since he was released but Gail would remain pure to be the guiding light of Carlito's heart in his soul's darkness. But the weight of Carlito's past apparently prevents him from taking off for a brighter horizon. Brian De Palma, on the road again with Al Pacino, signs another gangster classic, working like a sort of revisionist version of \"Scarface\", less flashy and flamboyant, but with a depth so hypnotic it might have cost him the same iconic success of its glorious predecessor.Carlito is a Puerto-Rican criminal who spent five years in jail and through the help of the barely recognizable Sean Penn, got his ass out of jail before the end of sentence. The speech Carlito gives in the beginning has a sort of showiness which I always thought not to belong to such a serious character, but the more I think of it, the more I realize that this is the realistic enthusiastic reaction of a man who feels like being born again, having a new chance. This 'new chance' is the defining element of Carlito aka Charlie, a strong desire to go forward and turn the back on an obscure past. This is \"Carlito's Way\": look forward and never turn your back, the tragedy of his character is that the same mindset that would prevent him from committing a mistake will ultimately sign his own death warrant.Now, I wonder if I should mention that the review contains 'spoilers', is it spoiling the film to say that Carlito dies at the end? the film clearly opens with the scene where he's shot by an unknown face. Who did it? Why? These questions don't matter since it leaves no doubt about Carlito's fate (he got enough bullets not to make us expect a happy twist ending) The gravity of the opening credits contrasts with the joyful courtroom scene and Charlie's celebration of his victory over Law with Kleinsfeld, but it creates something powerful that a few movies managed to achieved: the tragedy. Carlito's story is a tragedy because the inevitability of his death is already painted in bloody letters implying that all his actions will ultimately be swept off by the wind of futility. If he's dead, it's because he didn't see it coming, and from someone who decided not to look behind, this is one of the likeliest things to happen.\"Dead-End\" this is the French title of \"Carlito's Way\", and the word itself conveys the inevitability of Carlito's death, even his clothing, his dark hair and beard, and his leather jacket are the mark of a deadly presence watching him. Evolving in the 70's disco era, with all its flashiness and abundance of sex, drugs and violence, Carlito hardly gets incognito; a serious handicap for someone who just wants to finds his place. Carlito wants to make enough money to work for a friend in the Bahamas. Like in \"Scarface\" a criminal massacre plays a pivotal role as he finds enough money to invest from a drug deal incident which he's the only survivor, in both cases, we see the reality which Montana wanted to plunge in and Carlito wanted to leave. Carlito's way is a journey between two worlds trying to trap him, Law and Crime, with many obstacles, treacheries, and betrayals. But we end up realizing that Carlito's most dangerous enemy is Carlito.His torment can be compared to a sort of cat-and-mouse chase between two sides of his soul, culminating with the real cat-and-mouse chase sequence, which remains one of Brian De Palma's greatest contributions on the field of cinematic thrills. Now, should the movie have started with Carlito's death? I say 'yes' because otherwise, we would never stop complain about some of his unwise decisions, despite the way he justified them. The film is not about the tragedy but the reasons of this tragedy, reasons that make Carlito one of Al Pacino's most appealing characters. And if we have the feeling of being ahead of him all the time, feeling an imminent danger coming in that direction, we forget that the danger will always come from behind, and the irony is that he couldn't see it, because he was too busy walking, and sometimes running forward, but like in some of our most disturbing nightmares, he was also going backwards to finally meet his demise.This is the tragic aspect of \"Carlito's Way\" \u0085 with the light of hope incarnated by Gail's pure figure and something of Carlito growing inside her \u0085 well maybe the \"Dead-End\" title is misleading after all",

The story is about a man Carlito 'Charlie' Brigante(Al Pacino) who comes out of prison to start a new life but like other movies like this the past always come to haunt the man that tries to escape it. Al Pacino plays a character that is difficult to get use to with the street slang and the accent he uses. But after a while I got used to it, he plays a guy that goes by the code of the street and loyalty means everything to him to the point he will go to difficult length because of his loyalty and his street code ethics. So yeah even criminals have codes and ethics they go by and this man is a guy that goes by it no matter what. I wasn't quite sure I should like his character or not in the beginning but he becomes likable as the movie progresses, I mean he isn't the nicest guy and goes balls to the wall when he needs to, but he is likable because of his ethic and loyalty. This movie starts off a bit slow and might take a while for some to get there attention but it really does as it progresses and as the characters develop some more. The romantic element also works in this and has some good twist that is well developed. The acting is really good and for the most part believable, even the side characters are fun to watch because of there mannerism and they way they speak while also being believable. Anyone that likes gangster movies with a bit of romantic element will probably enjoy this.7.6/10",

I've watched hundreds of films, and can really only think of half a dozen or so that I've found to be better than this. I could tell after the opening monologue/narration that this was going to be an emotionally charged ride.Yes, perhaps revealing part of the end at the beginning was an unusual choice, but the viewer still doesn't know the full circumstances of what happened or what the final outcome of that scene is. It is thanks to the intelligence of the script, acting, and direction that we are still distraught when this scene does come back around again at the end.From the first scene to the last, everything about it is expertly handled: the costumes, set design, the script. The film holds no punches with many suspenseful scenes and action. The quieter moments also allows Al Pacino and Penelope Ann Miller's interaction to give the film a softer edge, which comes to a distraught conclusion at the finale.Both Al Pacino (as Carlito Brigante) and Sean Penn (as David Kleinfeld) are on excellent form. David Koepp provided a solid script, full of memorable scenes and dialogue. And despite not being very knowledgeable of music from the '70s, I enjoyed the soundtrack very much. Accompanying the soundtrack on the film is Patrick Doyle's musical scores, which are exquisite, especially during the Grand Central station scenes and ending.Full of emotional moments, solid action scenes, and a jukebox soundtrack that add to the overall atmosphere. The more times you watch this film, the more the brilliance of it will become clear. There are many standout scenes, and while subsequent views of the escalator scene may seem overlong, it is all masterfully put together, combining great acting, direction, and topped off with a super music score. A brilliant sequence of set pieces.This is one of Brian de Palma's most solid films that builds up to an explosive finale. Watch it multiple times: once to follow the film and there after to marvel in the filmmaking techniques. It was good to see such a talented director back on top form again with such enthusiasm and using many of his patented camera techniques to give the film extra gravitas.",

If Carlito was willing to kill in the opening scenes of the movie why wouldn't he have taken care of Benny in the club? These mistakes are in the minor category. Pacino is really good in this, he holds something back, letting you look inside him rather than screaming in your face, as in Scarface and Heat. Penn is beautifully slimy, the atmosphere reeks of 70's New York City, in fact the city seems to be a character in the movie. Penelope Ann Miller is heartbreakingly sad in a thankless role. I find myself watching the movie more than once in spite of its flaws.If you are looking a cool movie with good performances, this is a good choice.",

With the firm conviction of staying out of trouble to avoid prison again, Carlito faces many enemies who want him back in the joint: other drug dealers, the district attorney Norwalk, and even his lawyer. He also bought a disco to collect $70.000 and leave to the \"paradise\" island of Bahamas with his beloved woman Gail. Based on a novel by Puerto Rican author Edwin Torres, the movie brings back to life the Spanish Bronx in the 70s brilliantly, with all its mafia, corruption, and action. Many of its characters are impressively complicated, like Charlie, Kleinfeld, Lalin D\u00edaz (Viggo Mortensen), and dangerous capo Benny Blanco from the Bronx (John Leguizamo). A spectacle and a great work of art is waiting to be seen in \"Carlito's Way\".",

I didn't think that Sean Penn was that great in this film. I thought he tried too hard and I sort of thought he did the part pretty badly honestly. Don't get me wrong, I like Sean Penn a lot, but I just thought he played a dull performance. Overall, this is a good film by Brian DePalma, that will be appreciated more and more in the future.

He also doesn't encourage Pacino to overact as in \"Scarface.\" The result is a film that is overlong but entertaining, although it doesn't rank among the best gangster films that followed \"The Godfather.\" Pacino plays the kind of role he can play in his sleep, and it's a credit to him that he makes Carlito a sympathetic and interesting character.

I liked how there were some scenes where Al casually used Spanish slang that you would only know if you were Puerto Rican or heavily studied Puerto Rican slang (eg. mi pana (buddy) being tossed about during many of the scenes with other Spanish speakers).

You find yourself desperately routing for Carlito to succeed despite his vicious past, which he justifies by claiming to have had few options, and this you easily accept as Pacino shows a softer side to his characters nature with such artistry. Notable performances from Sean Penn and a young John Leguizamo amongst others add to the quality of this movie and the feeling of real characters being portrayed. This of course does the book (After Hours) justice as the author, Edwin Torres, was writing about the barrio in which he grew up and characters that he himself encountered there, the film preserving that feeling of intimacy with its subject.

So what exactly is the problem? How about the fact that the opening credits are over a montage with spoils the climax big time. I feel a little insulted. I guess in the end, it doesn't do severe damage. The climax is only moderately climactic, in part because it is spoiled....anyway.The curtain rises on a courtroom in session. Former New York drug king Carlito Brigante has gotten off the hook, thanks to a good lawyer. He is planning to go strait, raise a few thousand dollars, and start a car rental business, after getting back with his old gal (now a club dancer). One night however, his lawyer asks him to do a bloody favour, (actually he begs him). Carlito very unwilling to do so helps his friend, but things go south and suddenly Carlito is in danger again, from the cops. When they give him a chance to make good, does he take it or risk almost certain death by following his plan for the sake of his future with his girl.All in all, Carlito's Way does its job. It amounts to a entertaining New York crime tale: nicely shot, well acted and worth a look for the best of both Brian de Palma and Al Pacino",

            "content": "Under the careful direction of Brian De Palma written by David Koepp based on two novel by Edwin Torres, \"Carlito's Way\" tells the story of Puerto Rican criminal Carlito Brigante (Al Pacino) who after being released from jail for five years from a thirty year sentence thank mainly to his committed lawyer friend Kleinfeld (Sean Penn) is now focusing on trying to live off that horrid past by going straight. Feeling grateful towards Kleinfeld for getting him off early, Kleinfeld tells him to open up a nightclub that runs properly in which Carlito gladly obliges. Carlito thinks this will pave his way toward his goal to run a car selling business in a warmer climate.Unfortunately, Carlito discovers that Kleinfeld is nothing more than an untrustworthy shyster. Carlito has to put up with an excited and enthusiastic urchin named Benny Blanco (John Leguizamo), who think he's some punk kid who toughness is just an act to blend in. Carlito seeks towards his old sweetheart Gail (Penelope Ann Miller) who has ambitions to become a ballet dancer, but is struggling to make ends meet as she lowers herself to stripping. There are a myriad of memorable scenes where Gail tries to persuade Carlito to get away from the people he's dealing with fearing that it could put him into serious trouble or at the very worst, death.I may have mentioned that Kleinfeld was a corrupt little weasel, but that was an understatement. He's also a coke-addict and a conniving thief, who finds himself in a precarious situation and depends on Carlito as a way to try to get him out. Feeling like he's going to regret this sooner or later, decides to help him out on account the Kleinfeld released him from jail earlier than expected. next thing you know the Italian mafia is on the hunt after Carlito and Kleinfeld. Carlito does everything to escape from their clutches and to prevent Gail from getting involved. From the opening scenes, this crime drama of a film has a tragedy subtly implanted in the script which adds more bravado to what the story is intended to be.Viggo Mortensen is in a small supporting role as Lalin, a once powerful leader of a Hispanic mob, is now reduced to cutting deals with the cops and is now confined to a wheelchair. Feeling like there's no point in living as he begs Carlito to kill him, Carlito, out of pity and reluctance decides to finish him off.The poetic and power themes of the story is quite sublime. It's not a mindless violent gangster movie, in fact, the violence is few and far between. Instead it focuses on how humans degrade themselves and how life on the streets has an impact towards individuals who simply just want to live in peace and harmony. There's one great tender scene where Carlito tells Gail about a moment when he was 13, he had a fight he wanted no part of, but had to defend himself because he had to in order to survive. It tells you what you must do to ensure you throw back what life throws at you.The performers were pretty much impressive as a whole. The strange thing was that the movie is centered around Latino characters, with the exceptions of Leguizamo and Luis Guzman, the rest of the performers were not of Latino extraction. Pacino, who's Italian has a funny scene where the Italian mafia actually mistook Carlito for being Italian because of his physical complexion. Penn looks greatly transformed as a Jewish lawyer complete with the curly frizzy hair. Mortensen, is not very convincing playing Hispanic. Makes you wonder, with a plethora of Latino performers, why didn't De Palma search widely for more Latino performers to play these characters? It would have been more realistic.",

Oh well, I can't really decide here - both are good. I will say tough, that I personally find both are way better than the popular \"Heat\". Sorry De Niro !Lastly, I must add, the more I see of Pacino, the more he becomes one of my favorite actors. Many are talented and can \"steal the show\", but Pacino doesn't just steal it', he practically MAKES the movie what it is. He's not just in the movie. He IS the movie.

The insertion of \"You Are So Beautiful\" song was so out of place, it earns a chuckle. Also funny was a surprising cameo from Viggo Mortensen.It turns out Carlito is none other than Mr. Right. Who could have imagined that a mobster can be such a nice guy? You've gotta admire Carlito's ways with women. He's so respectful, understanding, kind and always in control (he's not even jealous)\u0085 Now of course that's completely unbelievable for a mobster (a killer that is), but it's alright, it's a De Palma film.The terribly uninspired narration by Al Pacino deserves a special note.

            "content": "I just love Brian De Palma films. They're just so good to watch and have the right mix of good dialogues and an appealing storyline to get the viewer hooked. Scarface and The Untouchables would serve as worthy examples to this fact, and now that I've watched it, I guess Carlito's Way does too. The film is an adaptation of Edwin Torres' novel \"After Hours\" which follows the story of ex-con/gangster/drug peddler Carlito Brigante (played by Al Pacino), who tries to shun away from a life of crime after being released from prison. Brigante had in actuality been serving a thirty-to-life sentence, which had gotten reduced to five years, owing to the influence his lawyer, David Kleinfeld (Sean Penn) had with the jury. Once out on the streets, Carlito pledges to live life the right way and reluctantly agrees to co-own a nightclub so that he can save just enough money to leave New York and start a car rental business. But inevitably, he's lured into crime once again, and how he fights the odds forms the rest of the plot.One thing that struck me as I watched the film was that everything was very direct. There is not really much for the audience to interpret. Each character is sketched out quite well at the beginning itself, and one kind of knows what he/she would tend to do under the given circumstances. For example, Sean Penn's character, David Kleinfeld is exposed as a corrupt lawyer, and subsequent events throughout the film show him as one, with all his shady dealings and money laundering activities coming back to haunt him. I liked this about the movie, because one is not left wondering what a particular scene means, or what that character was trying to say. Its all said and done. There. Take it or leave it. Of course, this kind of storytelling will not work in all situations, but here, it feels just right. Then there's that aura of the gangster about Carlito. In the beginning, he accompanies his cousin to a drug dealer's hangout for a transaction. As the scene develops, one can feel Carlito sensing that there's something amiss about the place. The tension is brilliantly captured by De Palma here and you can just feel Pacino getting into the skin of the gangster he's portraying. He knows exactly what's going to happen, he's prepared for it, and when it does happen, he knows what to do. This gut instinct comes to the fore in the latter half of the film as well and is part of the reason why this films works for me.There are a lot of scenes and characters which contribute to making the film what it is, such as John Leguizamo as \"Benny Blanco\" the young upstart who tries to get chummy with Carlito but fails, Gail, Carlito's former lover, with whom he rekindles his relationship and Luiz Guzman as \"Pachanga\", Carlito's right hand man. But to me, this one is Pacino all the way. He carries the film on his shoulders and commands respect in almost every frame. You can see that he's always in control and this again points to the direct nature of the storyline. The De Palma-Pacino-gangster plot combine gives rise to obvious comparisons with Scarface. But the two are so different. While Tony Montana is just a drug dealer, Carlito Brigante is much more than that. He's a larger than life personality with a heart, remorse, and a conscience. He believes he has a shot at redemption. Montana has none of this. He's arrogant, ruthless and has absolutely no feelings of guilt or regret. The differing nature of their characters make the two films widely different, thus making a comparison would just be a wasteful exercise. The climax sequence, shot at a railway station does bring back scenes reminiscent of The Untouchables, though the events that unfold in the two films are entirely different.Carlito's Way might have its share of flaws which may not put it in the league of gangster flicks such as Goodfellas or The Godfather movies, but it is still a classic, and a highly underrated one at that. De Palma himself is a hugely underrated director (It is a surprise to me how he hasn't won an Oscar yet), and this film just underlines his capability. This one's a must watch for all fans of mob films, but I think that at its very basic level, it's just a story about a man with a heart.",

The latter half or so is an action packed delight featuring tightly woven suspense segments, awesome memorable direction, acting, writing and cinematography. Unfortunately the development sequences more often then not show both DePalma and Pacino tripping over themselves in an embarrassing fun house mirror reflection of their classic Scarface. Pacino at times is a laughable caricature as Carlito, who among other things cant nail down which accent he likes best, John Milton, Tony Montana, or Michael Corleone. His acting is unbridled hammism at its worst, but even worse is the film itself. The beginning development scenes are either cringe bad, downright boring or both. But hang in there, because it morphs into well above average fare once it finally finds itself long about the 4th reel.",

Penelope Anne Miller puts in a surprisingly good performance as Carlito's lover who has always being displeased about his ways.What makes this film different from other gangster films(however this film is not strictly a gangster film) is that we actually feel sympathy for the characters, that they are not shown to be thorough 'bad guys'.  We see Pacino trying his best to change his old ways).The final 20 minutes of the film will totally suspend you in absolute awe from an excitng chase on foot throgh to a devastating climax with great performances and direction all round.If you enjoyed Scarface, Goodfellas or Casino then this film is definately for you.***** out of *****",

Carlito did.CW traces the true rehabilitation of Carlito Brigante (played by Al Pacino), a Puerto Rican drug lord, incarcerated, then sprung through a technicality after a five year prison sentence that he was rightfully charged for.You might expect a guy like that, who is given a new lease on life through paperwork and not true justice, would return to his old wrongdoings. But Carlito's goals are pure: he's going to move to \"paradise\" and become a car rental agency worker. His first step to realizing this dream? Raising 75 grand from taking over the club of a debtor that is called -- I'm not kidding -- El Paradiso. In the setting of the club, in the darkened corners of his old neighborhood, try as he might to eschew his old lifestyle, the past proves a slippery fish to release for old Carlito.Carlito's struggle is deep -- he feels disconnected to the world outside, in part because he feels like everything else -- the faces, the names, the businesses -- have changed, and in part because he feels unrecognized for who he has become -- a man apart from the Carlito the old familiar faces want him to be.De Palma and the producers are in love with the outside / inside motif, and use every chance they can to leave Carlito out in the rain, wistfully watching ballerinas through long windows. Top-shelf cinematography. Sean Penn stars as Carlito's Jewish lawyer, Kleinfeld, and honestly, after all of the Sean Penn flicks I've seen, I had absolutely zero idea it was him until mid-way through the film. Set to a score by Patrick Doyle, the opening credits alone warrant reason to put this on. Carlito's Way is such a good flick that you might actually feel selfish if you watch it on your lonesome.",

            "content": "Before I review this film, I would like to mention that during the early 1970's, Al Pacino's film career was off and running. \"The Godfather\", \"The Godfather Part 2\" and \"Dog Day Afternoon\" rank as three of the greatest films of the decade and of all time and they all starred Pacino. Unfortunately, they were also hard acts to follow as the majority of Pacino's output since then has failed to live up to expectations. \"The Godfather Part 3\" was an OK film but it was not on the same greatness level as its two excellent predecessors. Those who were disappointed with \"The Godfather Part 3\" (and there were many) may be more likely to enjoy this film in which Pacino's character is faced with a similar decision and storyline but his character here is a little more restrained and passionate than the mostly brutal and remorseless Michael Corelone. Pacino portrays Carlito Brigante, an organized crime kingpin who had been imprisoned for several years. His attorney friend (Sean Penn) grants him a retrial and manages to spring him out of prison. Carlito's intentions once he's free and back on the streets are clearly to go straight and leave the criminal life behind for good. However, some of his old cronies and some vicious young gangster hoods don't believe that it's possible and won't let the \"legend\" leave without a final fight. This gripping crime drama is Pacino's best film in years and a great alternative for those viewers who were expecting more from \"The Godfather Part 3.\" Director Brian DePalma is also in fine form and considerably improving on his previous film, \"Raising Cain.\" A supporting cast and period soundtrack (film is set during the 1970's) also contribute to its success.",

Big curly hair, geeky glasses and he looks like he doesn't belong in the company of these gangsters... but as the film goes on he changes. The pressures of life gets to him and he can't handle it. His character has a hard time and i felt sorry for him towards the end of the film.I loved the action sequences. The gun fights and make-up were great.

He insists that he's going straight, but, then, he says something not quite as memorable as \"just when I thought I was out, they pull me back in.\" Al Pacino playing a Puerto Rican-American is a stretch, physically and vocally. The latter of which becomes all too pronounced whenever his voice pops in the annoying narration. But, this is familiar territory for Pacino, except without the family. He's on the other side of the Italian mob and nobody has his back. His closest ally is cocaine addicted Jewish lawyer cum gangster-wannabe, played by Sean Penn. If you want to know why people bandy about how Penn is `the greatest actor of his generation' and don't understand why, then perhaps his performance in this film will convince you. Any other actor would like a fool in the hair and make-up he sells to the audience rather effortlessly. The guy is a chameleon. Viggo Mortensen appears briefly in a cameo and leaves quiet an impression. At times, particularly towards the end, the material gets trite and cartoonish. Yet, there are scenes that are so well choreographed and teem with tension, that you have to take your hat off to the director. He's a living legend. 7/10.",

            "content": "New York, 1975: A Puerto Rican criminal Carlito Brigante (Al Pacino) is released from prison due to a technicality and announces his plans of going straight and leaving his old gangster life behind. Easier said than done: in his job of managing a night club there are plenty of old friends and enemies trying to pull him back into the shady side of life, and especially Carlito's long-time lawyer and friend David Kleinfeld (Sean Penn) proves out to be dangerously unpredictable in the maze of temptations known as the nightlife of 1970s New York. Luckily Carlito's girlfriend Gail (Penelope Ann Miller) is there to support him, even if she's unhappy about the hazards in his life.Director De Palma does a good job at portraying Carlito's world. The colourful lighting in the nightclubs, the long takes, tracking shots and Dutch angles are skilfully used and only occasionally become distracting from the story. Especially the final chase scenes in the subway and train station are also excitingly presented, even though the main focus of the film is not on action.The actors are generally good, especially the bearded Pacino in the lead role, but Sean Penn is convincing as the weasely lawyer Kleinfeld as well. The presence of Pacino also leads thoughts to the 1983 De Palma classic Scarface, as both deal with Hispanic figures in the American underworld and are quite lengthy and unhurried, even if the later film ultimately contents itself with a less epic style and Carlito Brigante is a much calmer character than Tony Montana. In short, Carlito's Way succeeds fairly well in bringing life to its characters and the technical direction is enjoyable to follow, so every crime film fan ought to give it a go \u2013 De Palma fans won't be disappointed either.",

Lawyers may actually be ashamed, if that's possible. I remember this film coming out and didn't remember how well regarded it was. But I really enjoyed it. Plot is not too revolutionary...just the story of a local drug pusher named Carlito (Pacino) recently released from jail and trying to keep to the straight and narrow. However, some don't wish to leave Carlito free and safe on the sidelines, including a lawyer named David Kleinfeld (Penn). Kleinfeld has Carlito in his debt and it is through his convoluted entanglements that Carlito is pulled back into the fringes of crime. Pacino's accent conjures up memories of his turn in \"Scarface\" as a Cuban hood, and it does sound vaguely pimp-ish. Nevertheless, as acting goes, Pacino is solid without edging into self-parody and Penn adds another notch to his belt of roles he can play. The perm notwithstanding, he is superb in the film, and, while I'm not sure if he received an Oscar nomination for this role, I think he may well have deserved one. He plays an insecure, homicidal, drugged-up lawyer. Penn manages to capture the real danger that this man, as insecure as he is (and who wouldn't be, really, with that perm?), poses to those with whom he clashes?",

In this movie he is supposed to be a Puerto Rican gangster, but frankly, what I see is an older white man who's trying to walk cool and he only looks whiter because of the black clothing and dark glasses he is wearing.The believability of characters suffers overall due to their actions and the mood that this movie picks. Al Pacino's character for example is charming to the max and never does anything evil or at least undeserved...for someone who is supposedly a hardened criminal. His love interest, and by extension their relationship, is not very believable. Not because they do not have chemistry, they do, but the story is such that she should hate him or at the very least have a very complicated attitude but instead it plays out like a fairytale.At one point in this movie during a heartfelt moment I started hearing high pitched touches on a piano, the kind of music you would hear in a romantic comedy.This light mood is strange because at times there is some pretty violent stuff happening.One of the best things about this movie, though it takes a while to pay off, is Sean Penn as the shady lawyer. This guy has some range. Seeing him as this nervous slithering pair of round glasses with curly hair is amazing, considering the other roles he has played.The storyline is largely transparent. A criminal is trying to retire and that does not want to work. It's another gangster movie.But it is an entertaining gangster movie. It flows well. It has a style it is sticking with. It is well shot. It is like a shiny 80s blues or jazz record. It is a bright gangster movie if there is such a thing and it grows on you towards the end.",

This film is so breath taking that I could watch it over and over in spite of its running time. I do think this is as good as classic mob movies like Goodfellas, The Godfather, Casino, or Hawks'Scarface. This is also a very moving flick.

Pacino plays Carlito Berganzi, a Puerto-Rican ex-con who is trying to avoid the seduction of the streets whilst raising enough money to get away from New York. De Palma's classic shows a love story with Carlito reuniting with his true love (Penelope Ann Miller) after 5 years, and subsequently aiming to redeem himself in her eyes. The lure of the streets is evident throughout, as well as Carlito 's pride and loyalties to his coke-addicted lawyer (Sean Penn). The movie contains frequent edge-of-the-seat action scenes and phenomenal pieces of acting throughout. It allows us to empathise with Carlito and believe that he is genuine in his reformed spirit.

They have so much personality, and I really love that. When I know a film is made by De Palma, I expect it to be melodramatic, which means maybe even some laughable (but memorable and entertaining!) dialogue. I also expect lots of swooping camera movements and over the top cinematography. Also, an intense film score is bound to be laid on top of it all. And you know what? I love it. I love Brian De Palma films. If this isn't your thing, well then it's just not your thing. This happens to be my thing, though. I love this filmmakers style. His films never drop below a 9/10 for me, but I understand that some people might not be charmed by it all as much as I am. IF'd a matter of personal taste.The thing I find a little annoying is the criticism De Palma gets for a his casting. We all know Al Pacino is not Puerto Rican and Sean Penn is not Jewish. This doesn't bother me like it does for a lot of people. I've know plenty of Puerto Ricans that are light skinned. If I had to go with Pacino or Raul Julia, I'm probably going to go with Pacino... and I don't think Benicio del Toro was the right age in 93. Finding a Puerto Rican lead actor with star appeal was a lot tougher back in the early 90s, and we all know that Al Pacino has a significant draw. People came out to see this film to see Pacino play another gangster. That's what fans of the Godfather and Scarface want. This film kind of blends those two films styles together. I think Pacino did a fantastic job. I wish people could lighten up a little about it, though. I mean, they even wrote in some pretty funny dialogue when the Italian gangsters teased Carlito near the end of the film for looking like an Italian.The only slight flaw in this film for me is the heavy voice over but there are parts of the voice over I liked, particularly the very beginning and the very end. We probably could have done without all the rest in my opinion because it didn't feel that necessary.For me, Sean Penn steals the whole movie. What a great character. I'll never look at Penn the same way again and that's totally fine by me because it's a very memorable performance.So, if you enjoy epic and melodramatic gangster films, you can't go wrong with Carlito's Way. It's a bit more mature than your average gangster flick. The romance in it is a nice detour from the usual thing and it may even tug at your heartstrings a bit. It's pretty cool when a movie begins with the end of the story and can still engage you throughout the entire film. Carlito's Way had me emotionally invested. I enjoyed this one.",

Luis Guzman is, for me, a welcome presence in any film.But the real fun comes from watching Sean Penn play Carlito's corrupt, sleazy, coke-snorting, loose-cannon defense attorney. He appears to have had a good time doing it, too. I found Penn hilarious back in 1993, and he's still the most entertaining thing in the movie.However, Penelope Ann Miller is painfully unwatchable. I mean that literally. God knows she's sexy and beautiful, but at times I actually had to look away when she was onscreen. Maybe it's the role -- her aspiring-ballerina-turned-stripper character never seems real -- or maybe she was just miscast.

It means that if you are in the criminal world you have either to kill or they will kill you - just like in an animal world.

I've watched hundreds - thousands - of films, and can really only think of half a dozen or so that I've found to be worse than this. I could tell after the opening monologue/narration that this was going to be comedically horrendous, and only kept watching to see how much worse it might get.Having just sat and read through loads of pages of good reviews here, I cannot work out from where these positive comments are coming. From the first scene to the last, everything about it just seemed utterly ridiculous. The predictability, accents, costumes, set design (how is all of this 1975??), and, perhaps worst of all, the script. Completely over the top, all of it. I couldn't take any of the characters seriously, and simply could not believe what rubbish dialogue they were given to spout. Poor Viggo Mortenson - how can he not be ashamed? ('you no hear?' Please!). Poor everyone...I don't necessarily feel I'm including any spoilers, but have ticked the little box just in case; therefore, to further say: The theme of time/mayhem was slightly clever (ie 'we'll only be in there ten minutes', '30 minutes, tops', and 'i'll be 5 minutes, trust me' - and then of course, madness and violence ensues. But these were all as predictable as a character in a teen horror film saying 'I'll be right back' - we all know what's going to happen. Also found the station/stairs(escalator)/shoot-em-up correlation between this and The Untouchables (also DePalma) to be crossing the 'auteur' line bit too much - I kept waiting for the baby buggy to turn up. Yawn.Speaking of which, I note that in the 'goofs' section here, there is no mention of the moment where, after calling him Charlie (far too many times) in a scene in her apartment, at one point Penelope calls him Tony. And for any caption/subtitle users (I sometimes watch with them, as the house where I live can tend to be loud), in the scene where Pacino, Penn, and Steffie (gal from the bar) are at the posh country house, for one line of Steffie's dialogue, the subtitles mistakenly note that her character is called Gail. Nice.The only almost-remotely, almost-redeeming scene involved a certain peering through an apartment door and a mirror; but even with that, we are given Penelope Ann Miller. Really bizarre choice.In all my years of using IMDb and voting for films, I believe this is the only '1' I've given, and definitely the only review I've felt compelled to post. How can anyone who truly appreciates, say, The Godfather {or insert a standard considered-to-be masterpiece title} put this piece of gunk in the same calibre? I just don't get it...",

Carlito's Way re-unites De Palma with Al Pacino, who plays the titular Carlito, ten years later for another 1970's crime story about dealing cocaine. Instead of a Cuban immigrant to Miami, Pacino is a Puerto Rican drug dealer who is caught, sentenced to a large sentence in prison, but due to some legal complications he is sprung by his lawyer, played by Sean Penn as a smart but out of his depth amateur, after only serving five years. The catch here is that Carlito has truly been rehabilitated by his time in jail and surprise freedom, he has no desire to return to the high life he once had. Instead, Carlito wants to start a new life in the Bahamas as a business owner. It's a nice dream, but life circumstances seem to conspire against Carlito to draw him into impossible choices between family, friends, and his honor. Pacino is fantastic here as Carlito, providing the charismatic Pacino outbursts we know well and would obviously go with an outlandish character who rubbed shoulders with criminals in the barrio selling drugs, but also brings a quiet and reflective side to the character that reveals the human underneath that wants stability, peace, and a family. In one sequence, Carlito can be the owner of a club who throws out a young and rising drug dealer with condescending attitude and flare and in another sequence he can quietly take measure of his situation reserving any outburst for those he loves. De Palma goes all out here with several tense sequences, a dynamic camera, and a chase/shootout finale sequence for the ages. It's not a perfect film, but De Palma's craft mixes well here with a kind of \"what could have been\" humanistic take on the drug dealer story.",

It's actually not so true this last statement: \"Carlito's Way\" is not so much a cult classic, simply because it is always overshadowed by her capricious sister \"Scarface\", but also due to the same reasoning is not completely forgotten because shares a similar geneticIf one compares, \"Carlitos Way\" is slightly better than \"Scarface\", but also has the usual De Palma serious problems (and we do not talk about Hitchcock imitations). But though this 1993 film is based on a book, has a striking eye to correct the errors of the film 1983. Al Pacino is much more controlled (however here also tends to overflow, to relax) and while sometimes falls into inertia, on the other hand is brilliant in the dramatic moments. Also, the relationship with Penelope Ann Miller is much more heartfelt, unlike the insipid and quasi-misogynist Tony Montana / Elvira connection. There is a sense of sophistication over Carlito Brigante, and even the soundtrack is much more current than the over-stylization of Giorgio Moroder, same with the aesthetic that is much less colorfulBut it is true that the argument does not click where it belongs. This is the story of a man who is redeemed, and could be taken two ways: become an existential crime drama \u00e0 la Woody Allen (highly unlikely), or be a Western transferred to mafia traditions. Instead deviates to casual reflections in the vein of \"The Godfather 3\" (\"Just when I thought I was out, they pull me back in\"), and then continue as a bastion of \"Scarface\" in style and repeating many of its sins: again the flashy aesthetics in the disco, again the unimpressive criminals, again the ridiculous nicknames for the gangsters (here: \"Saso\"; \"Pachanga\"; \"Lalin\"), again the relentlessly repetition of the word \"fuck\" (the most punished is Sean Penn, who often repeated), again the mediocre actors. While \"Carlito's Way\" corrects some problems of the 1983 movie, in turn there are some pretty bad scenes: the pool scene is artificial, with Pacino went really placing the ball to give right on the target, with Pacino running so clumsy to the bathroom. It is certainly an achievement of direction and style, but it is less shocking than the chainsaw scene of \"Scarface\", plus it follows the same pattern: the pool scene, like the chainsaw, are disconnected from the film, with the sole purpose of generating a \"Wow! \" scene; plus we again find mafia scams who want to kill their main stockistsAnd like \"Scarface 1983\", the film is long, full of easily editable sequences: for example the appearance of Viggo Mortensen seems a desperate cameo for the actor to appear in the movie. The OFF voice of Pacino is good, although it is packed with some Pop psychology about urban life rather than a true reflection of his redemption. But despite the errors, the script and De Palma are responsible for a great moments. Pacino's relationship with Penelope Ann Miller is felt, even with some nonsense (Pacino goes to a home roof, with a trash can lid on his head to cover from the rain, watching his beloved) and the fact that De Palma costs to move to another instance (which makes the romance consume unnecessary minutes). For its part, the script adds sophistication to Carlito Brigante: this is a smart guy who knows the actions of the mob. Pacino performance in the drama is excellent: in the pool scene for example, Pacino's face in the first moments warns us that something is wrong here; and other scenes we can also discover more of his interpretation (when Penn appoints the boat in front of Miller). About style, De Palma sometimes tuned to \"The Untouchables\" and is generally pretty good, but suffers from excessive expressionism: Not all camera movements and angle distortions are subtle. However, in his honor point out the sequence of persecution in the terminal, which is even more tense than the defaulter tribute \"Battleship Potemkin\" in \"The Untouchables\"(Warning: Spoilers in this paragraph) And while the film is fairly good (even the non-gangster Carlito Brigante nature of his redemption can justify some numbers: eg supposedly prestigious and millionaires mobsters using only a few thugs, ahem), the film decides to commit a suicide in almost end. Just a bad end, and there are three main reasonsThis review continues on my personal Tumblr (Reviews and The City tumblr), which has no commercial purpose now",

            "content": "Right from the start this film looked promising and it sure was all the way through to the end. It is predictable that whatever Al Pacino stars in is going to be a masterpiece of some sort. Carlito's Way is another one of his masterpiece and what's even better is that Sean Penn costars and Brian De Palma directs this film as well. The beginning makes no sense at all but right from that moment as Al's character voice overs it just gives you a good masterpiece sort of feeling. Everyone should be grateful and privileged that they are seeing one of the best movies ever made. The dialog is fine and the story is interesting while some of the action scenes are smart and cool. Al Pacino is the best actor in this whole film because without him this film would be junk and should be avoided at all costs but thankfully Brian De Palma casted him. Sean Penn was good as well but his appearance looked hideous and made him look like a complete retarded lawyer. To put a long story short: Sean Penn could not give a better performance than Al Pacino. The real credit goes to the director, Brian De Palma. for creating this and without him all would be lost and watching this movie would be a waste of time. F*ck the Golden Globes for not giving Carlito's Way an award because this film is as good as Scarface and Good Fellas. The music is this film is pretty explosive and it really captures you at the end fight scene.Carlito, a Puerto-Rican drug boss, is out prison after serving five years all thanks to his lawyer friend David Klienfeld. He vows to stop his past from landing him in jail again but trouble starts following him and young druggies want to make a name for themselves. He becomes embroiled in something dangerous even for him and when things go bad he has to run away from some enemies. His old girlfriend gets back with him and together they have to make it out alive. A trail of deception always follows him. Cops and killers will be after him and he has to outwit them all and save himself.This film is not like how Scarface was, all blood and guts with no story, but this film is unique because it offers a great potential story with minimum amount of gore. You have to watch out for the fight sequences because they will blow you away and I mean really blow you away. This film does have flaws and one of them is the bad acting from Viggo Mortensen and he sucked bad because he didn't look like a gangster at all. Guess he was still a rookie back then. The other big flaw is Al Pacino's Puerto Rican accent which fails him completely to where he was born: America or Puerto Rico. Overall, this film doesn't disappoint but many people will be disappointed because this film tells the end before the beginning and they are right that it ruins the point of the film. Everyone should have a good time even though if it is a little bit slow or boring but wait until the end. Please! If you liked this film, I also recommend Good Fellas, Scarface, Casino, American Gangster, and Death Sentence.",

For me the opening sequence sums it up; Carlito has just been shot and rather than high action and colossal amounts of blood we are given black and white, quiet and serenity. It feels like the camera never stops moving twisting and turning from Carlito's POV to the bystanders, this effect mimics the sick feeling of passing in and out of consciences incredibly well and at times is hard to watch. The nineteen-forte esquire Humphrey Bogart style voice over is the icing on the cake, it's not self-indulgent or corny, and it doesn't give away the rest of the film but wets the appetite for what is to come.",

The actor interprets here a man of honor brought up to the code of the street, seeking at all costs to obtain his redemption and his freedom, the total antipodes of a Tony Montana. His way of the cross in view of this new beginning will be strewn with the pitfalls of his past as a thug from which he cannot escape, of his friends and former associates who put obstacles in his way, voluntarily or not.And if Pacino is perfect in the role of this man who clings to a dream that seems lost in advance, his playmate Sean Penn is just as good as a cocaine-addicted, crooked and paranoid lawyer.The script has a rare emotional power for a film of this genre, conceals a certain Shakespearian dimension, and wonders about salvation, while scratching the small world of so-called legit bosses but always ready to make blows to the back.Through a sober and fluid cinematographic gaze, DePalma films this story with panache and passion, playing a lot with reflections and alternating editing for example, instilling a crazy suspense at certain moments (the sequence in the billiard room with Carlito and his young cousin, and especially the last chase scene in the corridors of the subway and the New York station...), without forgetting superb moments of grace, like the stunning opening and closing shots.We are taken by the force of this story for almost 2h20 without seeing the time spent, and after viewing, we put it on the shelf next to Scorcese's \"Goodfellas\" or Coppola's \"Godfather\". 10/10.",

            "review_title": "A Bit Familiar, but Still Entertaining",
            "content": "Carlito's Way is basically the thematic and stylistic sequel to Scarface. Not only does the film have a very similar aesthetic look to Scarface, the film basically tells the inverse story of that film, what if he tried to change? Scarface was about a man who thought he had it all and overestimated his own intelligence and luck which ultimately led to his downfall whereas Carlito's Way is about a man KNOWING that he can't survive in the violent world of crime and trying to escape it.Al Pacino plays a Puerto Rican ex-con named Carlito Brigade who gets out of prison after serving five years of a thirty-year sentence due to technicalities with the help of his lawyer, David Kleinfeld(played by Sean Penn) in 1975 New York Spanish Harlem. Carlito tries his best to stay away from his past life of dealing drugs so he works at a nightclub to make enough money to retire in the Caribbean. But sooner or later, Carlito is dragged back into a life of crime, murder, and betrayal.Carlito's Way is certainly not a bad film. It has some good performances, the direction is great, the cinematography is often beautiful to look at, and the film is entertaining from start to finish. But what makes the film good but not great is its familiarity. Not only does the film feel exactly like Scarface, the story just feels very familiar. It's the classic story of a criminal trying to redeem himself but the film never puts any interesting spins on the concept. It basically just boils down to him not wanting to be part of crime anymore, then he's forced to do a job for someone, then he's forced to use violence and break the law again. The film's story is never as engrossing as I wished it to be, because it just feels so familiar.But even though the story is a bit familiar, this is an undeniably well- made movie. For one thing, the direction is highly energetic. As usual, De Palma directs the film with a stylized feel that makes the film have a very larger-than-life, cinematic feel. It's as if De Palma KNOWS that it's just a movie and doesn't really care about realism and while a lot of people like to complain things that are \"unrealistic\" these days, I think De Palma's direction actually works in the film's favor. The emotions of every scene are always brought to the forefront with a somewhat melodramatic score by Patrick Doyle and some showy camera-work. Some may say this makes the film lack subtlety, but I think it makes the film much more entertaining than had if he went for a \"realistic\" approach.De Palma's direction really shines during the final chase sequence. The camera-work is incredibly fluid with an excellent use of long takes following Carlito around as he's being chased in the train station and the whole scene is flawlessly edited and incredibly suspenseful. Doyle's score adds to the tension as well. This scene alone, makes the whole film worth seeing at the cinemas.The cinematography by Stephen H. Burum does an excellent job conveying both the gritty, crime-ridden environment of Spanish Harlem and the high-end style nightclub where Carlito works. The scenes at the night look JUST like Scarface, with a disco, neon, purplish look to the whole thing. While this isn't a particularly challenging role for Pacino, he once again, does a good job and is a complete bada$$ the whole film. Penelope Ann Miller is OKAY in the role of Gail, Carlito's love interest, but I feel this role could've been given to a bajillion other actresses at the time. But for me, the biggest scene stealer is Sean Penn as David Kleinfeld. Penn is just great to watch as this coked-up, sleazy lawyer. He easily has the most energy out of everyone in the cast and is the most interesting character of the film. John Leguizamo is fun as a young, up-and-coming gangster not unlike Carlito in his early years.If there's any gripes I have with the film, outside of the fact that it feels too familiar, it'd be Carlito's downfall. While it's well-written for the most part, I feel his first act of violence in the film where he shoots up some drug dealers in a set-up deal his cousin brought him to, comes too soon in the film. Carlito just shoots them off and there's that, no repercussions whatsoever. Now there is something I like to this, which is how quick the violence escalates in the film. It keeps the pacing nice and brisk but at the same time, I feel his downfall would've had more impact if it was a straight-forward downward spiral. Instead of starting out peaceful, then violent for a bit, then back to peaceful a bit, and then back to violence.Overall, while Carlito's Way's story may feel a bit familiar, De Palma's direction, the performances, the cinematography, and the overall entertainment value still make for a decent film. As long as you don't expect the brilliance of Scarface, you'll enjoy it. 7/10",

I found this movie to be profoundly detached from other movies of the general genre. Even though its a pretty common story, the execution through which this movie was made was fresh and interesting. The city, the drama, the violence, all captured well on both the written page and the screen. I found that everybody fit their roles with the exception of Penelope Ann-Miller. She didn't overact so much as lack the needed prescence for the character. She wasn't holding the screen with Pacino, and damn it, as the female love interest, she better. But things like that are minor contrivances to the great movie that is Carlitos Way. The action was well orchestrated, and the character interplay consistent. I felt that the best cast character of ANYONE in the movie, the role that was inseparable from the actor who portrayed it, was Sean Penn's Klienfeld. Beautifully acted, the whole time, you just want to punch the seedy little bastard in the face. The fact that i don't like Sean Penn too much as an actor says my liking for the role.

The movie stars Al Pacino, Sean Penn, Penelope Ann Miller, Luis Guzman and John Leguizamo.Carlitos Way is the second collaboration between Pacino and De Palma, after Scarface from 1983.The movie is about an Puerto Rican criminal, named Carlito Brigante (Pacino), who vows to leave the gangster life straight. However, his criminal past proves difficult to escape and he ends up being dragged into the same activities that imprisoned him.For an gangster movie, this film has an uncommon narrative technique. Carlito Brigante tells the story by his own. We see his view on the different activities and the viewer notices his thoughts and his emotions. What also is very important, that Carlito isn't a \"stupid\" criminal. He can analyze the situations and anticipate what is about to happen.Another important and uncommon role, is played by Sean Penn. He performs as the lawyer David Kleinfeld, in beginning he seems to be a normal and good lawyer. But through the movie the viewer recognize, that he is an corrupt lawyer, who would cross any line for his advantage.Also the love story between Pacino's and Ann Miller's character is quiet enjoyable. It feels like a realistic love story and the viewer gets to feel the anxieties in the relationship. Especially Gail (Penelope Ann Miller) wants to convince Carlito to quit the mafia and to act wise. But he doesn't stop following his codex and ideals. This behavior brings him into many troubles.All in all Carlitos Way is very good mafia movie. It shows different methods for a mobster movie and isn't so predictable as the most films in this genre. But from my point of view the ending is trash and whack. They should have found another solution.",

He does not recognize the new changes in the crime underworld of New York and fails to understand the new rules of the game. His new relationships with his old friend and lawyer David Kleinfeld (played by Sean Penn) and at a second level with former 'buddies' Saso (Jorge Porcel) and Lalin (Viggo Mortensen) show us that Carlito is not ahead of his game anymore. Carlito begins to understand this and tries hard to stay loyal to the only thing that connects him with his past self: the old love interest (Penelope Ann Miller) who has not forgotten him after all those years but at the same time does not appear to trust him anymore.I need not say more about this exceptional film that may well be De Palma's masterpiece.

Too lengthy, but exceedingly well-played by Pacino, Penn, Miller, and Leguizamo, in a menacingly squirrelly performance.

            "review_title": "The \"so-called\" sequel to Scarface",
            "content": "Just like \"Casino\" has been considered the \"so-called\" sequel to \"Goodfellas\", in my opinion, \"Carlito's Way\" is basically the \"so-called\" sequel to \"Scarface.\" The reasons for that explanation is because of the stars and similar story lines of each movie. With \"Goodfellas\" and \"Casino\", both movies starred Robert De Niro and Joe Pesci and were directed by Martin Scorsese. When it comes to both \"Scarface\" and \"Carlito's Way\", both movies star Al Pacino and were directed by Brian De Palma. And even actors that played minor roles in one movie appear in some capacity in their counterparts. Also in the past, there were weekends were I would watch both sets of movies together but on separate days from each other. But of course, there are differences between \"Tony Montana\" and \"Carlito Brigante.\" \"Tony Montana\" was basically a Cuban refugee hoodlum who along with other Cuban refugees, arrives in Miami, Florida during the \"Mariel Boat Lift\" in 1980 and within a few years becomes the top drug lord in Miami and uses cocaine as a source of power. But that particular drug also contributes to his downfall in the end. With \"Carlito Brigante\", he's a Nuyorican(Puerto Rican New Yorker) ex drug lord who returns to the streets of New York City in 1975 after serving 5 years of a 30 year prison sentence. Now planning to live a legitimate crime free life, he also tries to rekindle his relationship with Gail(Penelope Ann Miller) that he had before his imprisonment. But there are two causes to Carlito's downfall. The first is his lawyer, David Kleinfeld(Sean Penn)who not only has a very bad cocaine addiction but is corrupt and is also a retaliatory target of incarcerated Italian mob boss, Tony \"Tony T\" Taglialucci(Frank Minucci), another one of his clients. Carlito's second downfall is \"Benny Blanco\" who is a young, inexperienced punk who is trying to rise up in the drug trade by trying to surpass Carlito and is played by actor/comedian John Leguizamo, respectively. But in the end, is it Carlito himself that contributes to his downfall just for having a loyal trust in Kleinfeld and Pachanga(Luis Guzman), an old friend from his past. \"Carlito's Way\" was released in 1993 for which it was 10 years apart from \"Scarface\"(which was released in 1983). And another difference between each movie is the musical score. With \"Scarface\", the score was conducted by Giorgio Moroder and was synthesizer based. With \"Carlito's Way\", the score was conducted by Patrick Doyle and was more symphonic/orchestra based. But the soundtrack also consisted of songs from 1970's Disco groups such as KC and the Sunshine Band, The O Jays, The Hues Corporation, The Bee Gees, LaBelle, etc. that fit the time period of the movie(1975). And the soundtrack also consisted of songs from Latin music artists such as Celia Cruz, Hector Lavoe, Willie Colon, and Santana as well. And besides the other aforementioned actors, the other actors that comprised the cast such as James Rebhorn, Viggo Mortensen, Adrian Pasdar, Joseph Siravo, Richard Foronjy, John Ortiz, Ingrid Rogers and the late Argentinian comedic actor, Jorge Porcel(in his only American acting appearance) also put in good performances in this movie. And besides Al Pacino, other \"Scarface\" alumni such as Al Israel(Hector), Angel Salazar(Chi Chi), Cesar Cordova(Cuban cook), and Mike Moran(Nick the Pig)also make brief cameos in \"Carlito's Way.\" Just like he perfected the Cuban accent for \"Tony Montana\" in \"Scarface\", Pacino perfects the Nuyorican accent for \"Carlito Brigante\" in \"Carlito's Way\", even if he is an Italian-American actor. Although \"Carlito's Way: Rise to Power\" was, in my opinion, a good prequel starring Jay Hernandez as a young \"Carlito\" in his early years, it will never compare to the original film from 1993. \"Carlito's Way\", in my opinion, is another great gangster film that should be included in the ranks with \"The Godfather\" trilogy, \"Once Upon a Time in America\", \"Goodfellas\", \"Casino\", \"A Bronx Tale\", and of course, \"Scarface\"(both versions from 1932 and 1983/Al Pacino respectively). Also, look out for a director's trademark that director Brian De Palma left in both movies that involves a gun that includes a silencer and an arm in a sling. Of course, both \"Scarface\" and \"Carlito's Way\" have to be watched together side by side to find that director's trademark along with its symbolism.",

            "content": "I love Al Pacino. Just wanted to state that upfront. Now, his presence is not necessarily a guarantee for a five star movie, but usually it means that the movie is not total crap. This is the case with this particular title.The story is decent enough - Pacino's character, Carlito, is an ex-drug dealer, fresh out of prison, trying to go straight, but unable to do so, as one would expect (there's no quitting or retiring in the crime business).The characters are well enough developed. Carlito, as the main one, in particular. Especially his inadequacy in a world that's new to him (not only the legit world, but also the crime scene, with the new punks, people he knew but he finds to be changed, etc). Sean Penn (who I find annoying at times, but can't deny his talent) plays the support character of David Somethingorother, Carlito's old friend and lawyer. He once again does an extraordinary job. Some of the other characters might seem a little too stereotypical, but most of the '90s crime flicks suffer from this.Brian de Palma does a good job directing this flick, but I can't help wondering if he didn't spend too much of his career doing movies like Carlito's Way, The Untouchables, Wise Guys, Scarface (which are all great, don't get me wrong, just a little similar) and not enough doing things like Bonfire Of The Vanities or Raising Cain. But that's another story. Let it be said, however, that the movie is totally worth watching, be it that you're a mafia movies lover, or just want to see Sean Penn in a pair of round glasses, a la John Lennon.",

And although his best piece of work on the subject is \"The untouchables\", this one is worth a look.It features the journey of Carlito Brigante, an ex-con trying to live a life off-crime, to the Bahamas. He runs his own pub (ironically called \"Paradise\") in order to get the 70.000$ he needs to hit it off to Bahamas with his ex-girlfriend Gail. Unfornately, he owes one to his lawyer Kleinfield, who ends up getting him in big trouble.First, the bad part. The movie is the opposite of subtle. People yell their opinions about the gangster world all the time, all the shots are big and grandilocuent, even the ones that don't need to be that way, and the final shooting is completely unbelievable. But that's not necessarily bad if it doesn't bother you.The good part features an excellent interpretation by Al Pacino and good supporting by Sean Penn and Penelope Ann Miller. There's a small and very good role played by Viggo Mortensen, wich is also one of the best scenes in the movie. De Palma movies always have very intense moments, and even when the whole package is not that satisfactory, these scenes remain in your head.Overall a very good gangster movie by a good director and with good acting. Enjoyable as hell if you don't look for a very witty and subtle story.SAY NO MORE",

I'm convinced that the more times you watch this film, the more it'll begin to irritate you.**SPOILER** There is one or two delightful very memorable scenes however in my opinion. Firstly, when he's ran out of ammunition in the toilets, and secondly when Penn is sick onto the fence looking out onto the harbour.This film is text book, gangster film for the sake of a gangster film (A genre I usually try to avoid at all costs). Poor dialogue, coo-coo land fantasy plot lines, and probably it's most effective drawback is that it's made a mockery thanks to the terrible casting choices of ham extras and jobbing rent-a-crowds (Who are employed ad infinitum in an abundance of scenes).I get the feeling that sometimes whilst watching Paccino in this film, that even he wishes he'd never got involved.Pay close attention to the extras, it'll ruin this film for you.

The man is entranced by a girl's behind and drops the match. Only a few seconds later does he shake his hand as if he got burned. This is one of many details (not listed on IMDb) that poison this movie. Other aspects will strain your belief:How can a 300-pound man survive in East River hanging to a buoy? When exactly did Pacino's character take out the bullets from the gun in Kleinfeld's room? Why does Carlito tell the mafia he \"hasn't seen\" his lawyer when that's a dead giveaway for his implication in the killing of a mob boss? A pro like Carlito simply wouldn't make that mistake.Of course Carlito's Way is not without its brilliance. The party at Kleinfeld's summer house where everyone is snorting coke, the early pool bar shootout, etc. Great performances by Leguizamo and Mortensen. Sean Penn is simply brilliant as Kleinfeld, the corrupt lawyer, and his portrayal no-doubt inspired the Rosenberg character in the Vice City and San Andreas games. De Palma, however, falls in a common trap in Carlito's Way, he's afraid to take chances. Watching the \"making of\" documentary included on the DVD was almost painful. Carlito's Way clearly had many great ideas that were later dropped. One example is how the dialog was extremely vulgar gangster slang but reportedly was later changed to regular English because it made the Latino community angry. The pool bar scene is extremely well shot, but David Koepp, the screenwriter, admits that it's only a device to fool the audience for the next hour and put up with the rest of the movie which is mostly talk. Ouch. (note: If you want a movie where Pacino delivers lines flawlessly, watch Glengarry Glenn Ross)Then there is Jorge Porcel in the role of Saso, the club-owner. Porcel seems deaf and wooden when Pacino interacts with him. I thought it was an error in editing the first time I watched it. Again watching the \"making of\" explains it. De Palma cast a non English-speaking actor who has no idea what Pacino is telling him or when to deliver replies. As the audience you might be asking yourself \"why'd they do that?\" Carlito's Way was a bomb waiting to explode, you see, for its portrayal of Puerto Ricans or Latinos on a broader scale, as criminals. Solution: cast Jorge, a well-liked Argentinian TV personality, in a supporting role and hope to appease the masses. Some directors who become veterans decide that after a while it's just not viable to take chances anymore. Politics is what hurt Carlito's Way the most. This movie could have been number two in a trilogy of De Palma/Pacino gangster movies but in fact buries any chance of another gem like Scarface from being released.",

            "content": "Where Scarface was about a South American battling his way to the top of the crime world, Carlito's Way is about a South American gangster trying to leave his past behind him. The story is very good and believable, the problems for Carlito (Al Pacino) are very typical for someone in his position and the relationships are all very convincing. The fact that Edwin Torres based his characters on real people and that events in the film are inspired by real life, really help Carlito's Way to be a credible film. The fact that it is Carlito's lawyer, Kleinfeld (Sean Penn), who got him out of prison and then becomes a loose cannon who provides Carlito with too many problems is a great illustration of respect and excess going to someone's head.The performances in this film are extremely strong. Al Pacino is one of the best actors ever to be witnessed and is on outstanding form here. The beard, shades and long coat are a very good look for him and definitely provide him with one of his most fashionable roles to date. What is most convincing in this performance is his charm towards Gail (Penelope Ann Miller) as the audience, along with Gail, fall for him instantly, despite knowing his past. His scenes with Sean Penn are also amongst the films strong points because it always good to see Pacino act angry. The dialogue between these two is exceptional and really highlights how strongly Carlito's Way is written. Sean Penn does not let Pacino outclass him and gives one of his strongest performances. As an arrogant coke head, Penn portrays a character who is really repulsive and dislikeable and incites a great sense of hatred from the audience. Penelope Ann Miller does well to give the film feeling and bring it down to earth. It is pleasurable to watch her inner conflicts regarding Carlito as she pulls off the emotional scenes very professionally and is very effective at drawing out an emotional response from the audience. Luis Guzman and John Leguizamo are the two most memorable characters from the supporting cast, they both fit specific niches very well and both give great performances. It was nice to see Adrian Pasdar in the film, shame he wasn't in it for longer as the writers could have made something more out of his character.My only negative criticism of the film is that it could have done with a touch more action. Gangster films are at their most exciting when there is a high drama shootout but Carlio's Way only has two major action scenes. Luckily, the content is good enough to make up for this. The two shootouts are very good scenes, especially the last one as the tension build up is so intense.Stylish, realistic and stimulating, Carlito's Way would be a classic gangster film, had it not been overshadowed and over compared to Scarface. All the ingredients are right to serve up a fantastic film.",

            "content": "DePalma's film is a masterpiece on many levels. For one, it is historically accurate to the letter. Carlito, a former smack peddler, is released from prison after a few years. When released, the drug business has changed. Cocaine, rather than heroine, is the drug of choice for most New Yorkers. It is more expensive and much more widely used than heroine. Before Cocaine, drug dealers were guys who operated on the fringes of society and catered to artists and musicians. In addition, Heroine was relatively cheap compared to Coke. This was the world Carlito was used to in the 50's and 60's. Yet he was somehow able to make a name for himself in this parched landscape through toughness, street smarts and pragmatism.Now released from prison, he finds out that the dope business changed while he was on the inside. Cocaine is easily available and in high demand. Drug users are now part of mainstream society. They include young professionals, politicians and athletes. As a result, drug dealers are not only able to make more money, they also become celebrities in their own right. This was so true about New York in the 1970's. Guys like Nikki Barnes made the cover of magazines because of Coke. It was ridiculous. Another important issue to point out is the escalating violence that results as well. Because Coke is more expensive, dealers are able to buy more guns from the windfall profits. DePalma does an excellent job incorporating this into a generation gap issue between Carlito and the newer criminals. Carlito is a killer and a thug. But he killed for survival. Perhaps his mothers death when he was young gave him more respect for human life or his generation as a whole valued life more than the new generation of gangsters. Carlito was born in a time when many people did not survive childhood. Some women still died during childbirth. World Wars also took the lives of many men. Since the new generation didn't experience death like he did, they value human life less. More guns in circulation feeds the beast of indifference. Pachanga said it best: \"They shotgun you just to see you fly up in the air\".Overall, a great movie with a tragic ending. The movie incorporates many themes about living a life of crime, changing social attitudes and capitalism. Highly recommended.",

The directing and acting was excellent all the way through the movie. Any movie with Al Pacino is going to be a good movie right? I was really into the movie throughout the lenght of the film, to the point where I did not want to take my eyes off the screen because I was afraid I would miss something. However, without telling what happens, don't you think that the event at the end of the movie was horrible? They built up all this suspense towards the ending and then just crushed it. Even though I really enjoyed the film, I was extremely disappointed with the ending. So as a warning to others who have not yet seen the film, be prepared for the 'Worst Movie Ending In History'. They should make an actual award for that, this movie would definitely win, even this many years later!",

This or Sgt Tony Meserve in Casualties of War would be at the top of my list.

It shows how even a hardened criminal has a human quality and is capable of loving his girlfriend and remaining loyal to the \"code of the streets\". I am actually not a huge fan of Sean Penn and he was even hesitant to do this film. With that said, I thought it was a perfect casting. He played the 'nervous jew lawyer' brilliantly. I liked that they had a couple of holdovers (from Scarface) in the film to 'keep it real' yet introducing new quality blood to it such as: Penelope Ann Miller and Viggo Mortensen.

It's a rare actor who can put none of himself into a character, but Kleinfeld rings astoundingly true to life and contains no piece of Penn.Others have talked about the Grand Central scene, and I will comment on it some. So many chase scenes revolve around people and cars moving so quickly and randomly as to try and confuse the audience, with more bullets expended in one minute than during the entire series run of \"The A-Team\". This is too smart to be one of those scenes. The scene is based on brief moments of hiding and changing direction, followed by a 4 on 1 fight that drags out for close to a minute with probably less than 50 bullets expended in total.\nAlso excellent is the leadup to the Grand Central Scene, where Carlito muses and frets about whether he has covered all his bases in the short period of time he has to get to the train, then you watch as one by one he uses his gangster experience to defuse them all, except the one he wasn't looking for, which killed him. Also makes a statement when Blanco, one of the minor threats, is the one that gets him. Suggests that surviving in that gangster environment has more to do with keeping your mind sharp than being tough.",

Something I'm sure many here have done with their favorites.As mentioned in my title, there are some really funny contradictions in the story which can be found in the story line of many movies.Of course the most obvious is the reality of Johnny Briganti's pledge as stated in the summary \"A Puerto Rican former convict, just released from prison, pledges to stay away from drugs and violence despite the pressure around him and lead on to a better life outside of N.Y.C.\"LOL..!!If you \"pledge to stay away from drugs and violence\", then I would recommend jumping out of that FlameMobil as soon as possible when Johnny \"$30,000\" Ortiz informs you he is making a delivery for the Senor.. lol..New Years weight loss pledges usually last longer than that one..And of course after the shootout at the pool hall Carlito turns the corner in the Bario and states as he throws his gun into the dumpster.. something to the effect.. \"I'm not looking for this trouble.. it just finds me..\"..lol..

And something to learn is the way Al Pacino's character reacts in stressful situations,notice his eyes never gives away anything even in tense situations. Also the heroine's act is very good.

            "review_title": "Gritty, authentic and moving crime thriller that surpasses Scarface",
            "content": "Carlitos Way (1993) marked the second cinematic collaboration of director Brian de Palma and Al Pacino, the first being Scarface (1983). As a result the films often draw many comparisons, especially since they are both stories concerning the rise and fall of two charismatic immigrant criminals, both trying desperately to live out their own contrasting visions of the American Dream. While Scarface is now quite rightly considered one of the finest gangster films of the 1980's, in '83 this was not the case. It was critically slammed on release, and its a testament to its ambitious approach to illustrating the drug trade, and Pacino's iconic, unforgettable, almost career-defining performance as Tony Montana, that it has earned such a massive cult following since. Carlito's Way, by comparison, is completely overlooked, and something of a forgotten gem. Pacino's character, Carlito Brigante, is infinitely more likable than the explosive, irrational and ultimately paranoid & treacherous Montana. Its clear from one of the opening scenes in a courtroom, where Brigante is acquitted somewhat miraculously of all charges laid against him. He takes the opportunity to deliver a speech to the court, about how he is a reformed character and a changed man. Deep down he genuinely wants nothing more than to keep his head down, destroy his association with organised crime, and earn enough money in a straight job so he can move to the Caribbean. His lawyer and close friend played by Sean Penn, laughs at this suggestion. His character, by contrast, is a spineless coke-fuelled snake, who respects no-one and betrays Carlito's trust several times in the film. He continues to get on the wrong side of characters you should never cross, and Carlito repeatedly bails him out.Brigante is clearly very streetwise, with Pacino narrating much of the film in first person, and giving a fascinating insight into the mind of an ex-con, whose determined to go straight, despite the continued pressure from those around him, many of whom consider him something of a legend. There is not one scene in this film where the audience can consider him anything less than an genuine, honest, loyal and decent guy. Ironically, its Brigante's own morals and desire never to kill again that seal his fate. Later in the film, street justice is served ice cold, and his demise is as tragic as it is inevitable. Brian De Palmas unique cinematic style serves this film particularly well, with countless memorable tracking shots, the highlight of which has to be the railway station chase scene at the end. One of the most gripping, tense and suspenseful moments of any film I've ever seen.Carlitos Way is a long film, at almost 3 hours, but it passes by in a blur. No scene is too long or too unnecessary, they all serve to paint a vivid and convincing picture of the world these characters inhabit. In Brigante, Pacino portrays a character with dreams and ambitions, that to many seemed far fetched or even absurd, and that despite his honesty and loyalty, he is betrayed by almost everyone close to him, though ultimately he was still a good guy, who only wanted what was best for himself, his girlfriend and his unborn child. He wanted desperately to escape from the violent, cruel world in which he grew up, but it was a part of him, and he couldn't outrun his own past. In the final scene I was on the edge of my seat, praying Brigante would make it to the train, knowing deep in the back of my mind, that it wouldn't happen. In Scarface, the conclusion felt justified: Montana had betrayed people, he killed his best friend in cold blood, warped the innocent mind of his younger sister, and gets gunned down in his own mansion by a hit-squad, while 'high on his own supply.' Brigante, on the other hand, just didn't deserve it. It is simply the most moving ending to any film I have ever seen. I literally burst into tears. This is what makes the conclusion to this movie so devastating and powerful; it defies Hollywood convention. In spite of his past, and the errors of his ways, in the end the good guy dies. When he was so, so close to breaking free...",

A genuine shout-out has to go to Brian De Palma and his ability to film a frenetic set piece. The gunfights and chase scenes (particularly the one at the end of the film) are really terrific sights to see. I only wish there was as much attention put into the characters and drama. In longer movies like \"The Godfather\" or \"Heat,\" even the tiniest of moments and characters feel significant. No time is wasted. Here, a lot of moments and characters either feel simply \"there\" or like a retread of something we've seen in a different film.

Like most films by Brian De Palma, he's known for making his films look stylish making the shots long like some he did back in the day make the angles look unique. It'll let you know what was going on if something goes wrong. Al Pacino as Carlito Brigante, who used be a criminal after spending five years of a 30-year prison sentence vows to go straight and get into any illegal activities But that proves to be difficult when he ends up being dragged into the same activities that got him imprisoned in the first place. His lawyer, David Kleinfeld played by Sean Penn, keeps him out of trouble while he meets his girlfriend Gail played by Penelope Ann Miller. From what I am seeing so far I'm liking very much, granted the fact that it has pop songs that you heard about much like the ones I've heard of before. The chemistry between Al Pacino and Penelope Ann Miller is really good. You can see that they're really meant for each other. I really love the climax chase scene at the end, it is very thrilling and it left me on the edge of my seat. This is something that I should look up on very soon but what can I say, it is worth it. Carlito's Way may not be memorable to others like Scarface but it is an interesting crime thriller by Brian De Palma and stars Al Pacino.",

Penelope Ann Miler is pretty unbearable. Whining, ranting or blubbering throughout the entire run-length. Even her obnoxious dancing during the credits is annoying. Sean Penn is pretty good as the scumbag lawyer, and although Pacino does his best with a lightweight script and dull dialogue, but he's just phoning it in and ends up coming off as a parody of himself. The ending is quite strong and the tension is palpable, but yet another plot hole does away with it.",
