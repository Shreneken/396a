Just like the 1989 Batman movie it returned Batman to his dark roots and was a fantastic series.This was a great cartoon film. I haven't seen many great cartoon films but this was one. It has an interesting storyline, an interesting villain (The Phantasm), interesting subplot for Bruce Wayne and it's even got the psychotic Joker as well.The Phantasm is the most interesting cartoon villain in a long time and with the Joker in this movie as well it makes for an exciting movie. If you want an intelligent and thought provoking cartoon film then this is the one for you.",

            "content": "Regarded by some as the best Batman feature film, \"Batman: Mask of the Phantasm\" is an animated Batman movie released in 1993 to limited box office success. The film's reputation would grow over the following decade. Today many regard it as being superior to Chris Nolan's trilogy.The brainchild behind \"Phantasm\" was artist Bruce Timm, the man responsible for the look, style and tone of \"Batman: The Animated Series\". When he entered the DC universe in the late 1980s, Timm began to popularise a very specific drawing/animation style: a distinct form of Art Deco, with angular characters, hard, geometric shapes, retro minimalism and strong nods to 1950s modernism, futurism, and Old Hollywood. There's also a deliberate attempt to recapture the magic of Max Fleischer, the man responsible for the iconic Superman animated series of the 1940s. Your typical Bruce Timm female was also markedly different to previous comic book femmes: either angular noir women (Lauren Bacall, Jane Russell, Veronica Lake et all), or near pre-pubescent sexpots (small busted, lithe, teenage yet suggestively curvy). He'd release a sketchbook collection of simple-yet-hyper-fetishized nude girls/women a decade later, which would quickly become the dirty bible of many comic book artists.Today a lot of superhero cartoons poorly copy Timm's style \u2013 the style's now been played to death - but in the 1990s he revitalised DC and helped pull Batman away from the grip and stylistic influence of Frank Miller, who typified Batman of the 1980s.\"Mask of the Phantasm\" features a weak villain and unnecessary action sequence too derivative of James Cameron (\"Terminator 2\" was released the year before), but it's nevertheless a very moody picture, structured as a series of wistful dreams or tragic recollections, and features a genuinely affecting Gothic love story. Like the best Batman tales, \"Phantasm\" is more about detective work than fisticuffs. This Batman is voiced by the inimitable Kevin Conroy. It contains one of the best lines in Batman history.8/10 \u2013 Worth two viewings.",

Timm are without doubt the best creative team of any involved in a Batman film or/television show. In this first animated film based on the animated series, the creative team does both a prequel and a sequel to the show as it introduces the characters of Andrea and Phantasm. Which both have an enormous impact on Bruce Wayne's journey to becoming Batman. And the character of Andrea helps us understand Bruce Wayne a little better. And know him a little better before becoming Batman.Inspired by Frank Miller's \"Year One\" comic and Tim Burton's 1989 Batman film, Burnett/Dini/Timm create a magnificent Batman movie and a great movie as well!4(****)out of 4(****)starsAN ANIMATED MASTERPIECE!!!!",

'Batman: Mask of the Phantasm' Synopsis: Batman is wrongly implicated in a series of murders of mob bosses actually done by a new vigilante assassin.'Batman: Mask of the Phantasm' works from start to end. The main plot is extraordinary, offering an all twist in the caped crusader's legend, while the romantic-track, though slightly lethargic, has moments of emotions. And the Action-Sequences are sharp. In fact, the Animation is just top-class! Alan Burnett, Paul Dinim, Martin Pasko & Michael Reaves's Screenplay is excellent. Eric Radomski and Bruce Timm's Direction is of high-standard. Vocal-Performances are sure to mesmerize. Kevin Conroy as Batman, gives the legend a voice with sheer restrain. Dana Delany as Andrea Beaumont, is a delight. Hart Bochner as City Councilman Arthur Reeves, is deliciously despicable. Stacy Keach as Carl Beaumont, doesn't lack conviction. Mark Hamill as Joker, however, steals the show. What a frighteningly stunning performance! On the whole, 'Batman: Mask of the Phantasm' is a massive winner!",

            "content": "Mask of the Phantasm is one of the greatest, and criminally under-appreciated, Batman films ever made. It tells a heartfelt story about The Dark Knight which wasn't done like THIS before Batman Begins came along: Bruce Wayne was once a young man in love, trying to balance his personal life with that as a vigilante protecting Gotham City. Batman has secrets that he hides just like his identity. Andrea Beaumont is one of those memories Bruce keeps looking back on throughout the movie, and she really did change his life until she had to leave him. Little does Bruce know that she is still affecting his life as Batman: the Phantasm has been killing gangsters in the underworld, and we learn that Andrea is the Phantasm.This movie is one of the very best animated films I have seen; I kept re-watching it on VHS in the 90s as a kid, and even now it is still entertaining for me. It compliments the Batman: The Animated Series perfectly while also standing on its own just fine. Mark Hamill is still wonderfully chilling as The Joker's voice, Kevin Conroy IS Batman in this film, and Bob Hastings gives Jim Gordon's minimal role real impact on how Batman affects Gotham-life, being a committed voice of reason.Mask of the Phantasm has a great, emotionally complicated story and enough mystery around it to warrant a second viewing for any first-timers.If you loved The Dark Knight Trilogy, want something new and haven't seen this, DON'T MISS OUT!",

It combined action with a cool art style and serious plots that made the show just as appealing to adults as it was to kids. Mask of the Phantasm is a side-story of that amazing show, so it's no surprise that I still love it all these years later.Phantasm works so well because it pairs the usual themes of the show with an extremely bittersweet love story and tons of the detective elements that are always present in Batman's best tales. Equal time is spent with the present day mystery of the Phantasm, and Bruce's early experiments with vigilante justice. It's great to see Bruce Wayne get equal focus in the story, and in many ways the scenes with him out of costume are the most interesting and pivotal to the story. The Joker plays a crucial part in the plot, and a woman is introduced who had a powerful influence on Bruce's decision to become Batman. What more could the true Batman fan ask for? Mask of the Phantasm is worthy of being mentioned in the same breath as The Dark Knight and Batman Returns. There's a classic story within its animated trappings.",

From the almost poetic opening sequence, accompanied by a great, great score till the very ending this movie will not disappoint. A dark story, darker than in Batman Returns, but also an excellent portrayal of Batman. The characters are nicely drawn (the female character is very attractive looking) and the voices are perfect. The origin of my favorite superhero has been overdone so many times and yet the filmmakers easily succeed to bring new insight and depth to the man that is the bat. I feel like I should write something more about it, there's definitely a lot of stuff I forgot since seeing it, but this was definitely an overlooked movie.8/10",

            "review_title": "like a brilliant four-part episode from the series; lots of personal wounds revealed, and the Joker to boot!",
            "content": "Batman: Mask of the Phantasm stands on its own feet extremely well, when at least compared to some of the lessor Batman animated movies (Batman vs Dracula anyone?), and packs a good punch for fans so many years later. The original series was in its own other region- taking what more stories from the comics (if not overall style and atmosphere like Burton or Nolan)- and was able to cover some fine ground with our troubled hero the Dark Knight. This story tells of a character, not ever quite named but called here as 'Phantasm', who is killing off some of the high-rolling gangsters in town. Meanwhile, Bruce Wayne meets an old love of his, Andrea, and old wounds are opened over a brief and untimely ended engagement. And then there's also Andrea's father, who... OK, not much to try and spoil here, lets just say at some point the Joker gets involved, and everything jets into a 'laughing matter'.Even as it was meant originally for TV, the directors Radomski and Timm, through their writer collaborators, have applied a drawing style that is distinctive amongst other cartoons of its ilk from the period: very direct lines and sharp, jagged edges, lots of smoke at (specific) times, the right blend of noir when it comes to revealing the caped crusader when he enters a room in the dead of night. In a sense they're stylists as are the (good) directors of the franchise live-action films. Only here there's a catch: the running time is short (originally the filmmakers thought it would be meant for TV before WB changed their minds), so there's only so much time to dig into the dilemma Wayne is caught in in the movie, where his identity is being cross-checked all over as the killer of the gangsters, and then the personal connection with Andrea and her father. Its some fairly significant probing into the character, if not the deepest there's ever been.But also, aside from the slightly darker impulses, Mask of the Phantasm is a lot of fun, even up to a point if you didn't watch the series much. Just seeing Hammil ham it up as the Joker is a blast, even though he doesn't appear (almost, one might think, as a lark) until halfway through the movie! But he (via the filmmakers trying their best to give fans the best of the animated basics) supplies a hugely entertaining climax, one which involves a big fight among an immense diorama of Gotham City, rigged with explosives!",

There has been a lot of speculation in recent years about movie versions of Frank Miller's 'The Dark Knight Returns' and/or 'Batman: Year One' (the latter being an obvious inspiration for 'Mask Of The Phantasm'), I just hope that if either eventually get made they are as good as this. The popular 1960s campy TV series was an absolute hoot, but unfortunately has permanently coloured a lot of people's expectations of Batman, a character generally a lot darker and more twisted than most people expect. The animation in this movie is excellent, the script isn't a masterpiece but it's very good, and the actors involved include some great talents like Stacy Keach ('The Ninth Configuration'), 'Star Wars' Mark Hamill (as The Joker), John P. Ryan ('Runaway Train'), and Roger Corman legend Dick Miller ('A Bucket Of Blood'). I think most fans of Batman in any of his comic book incarnations over the years will enjoy this one a lot.

            "content": "Bioshock's iconic opening was surely inspired by that of the one in Batman: Mask of the Phantasm. They both use the same Futurist- steeped, sleek Art Deco style which inspire the towering structures of the city, and swoop in, out and between the 3D models to establish their mood and atmosphere. The film is from a time when animation was getting more and more comfortable with these types of three dimensional sequences which turn the traditionally flat canvas into a visual playground; think Quasimodo swinging around the bell towers of Notre Dame like Spiderman, or the iconic chandelier shot in Beauty and the Beast. It's an altogether more classical rendition of Gotham City and its inhabitants, cobbling together various anachronistic elements to resemble something of a neo-noir: steel arches, fedoras, figures ripped straight from Edward Hopper's Nighthawks, shameless womanisers, bikers with chains and bats, and the long halls and longer shadows of Wayne Manor. This is a far cry from the recent realist depictions of Nolan's Batman trilogy, which evoked a frantic, terror-stricken, post-9/11 atmosphere in a setting far larger than what a simple animated figure could cover in one night. Nolan's Gotham has slums within slums and cities within cities, indulging in panoramic widescreen IMAX shots, and reflect a reality where the enemy isn't merely thugs with guns but larger sociopolitical and economical structures. It is worlds away from the moralities that Phantasm initially implies in its art: stark, boldly lined, clearly drawn. Like a true good old fashioned noir the story dives almost immediately and often into flashbacks that dole out the backstory. The film avoids the usual familiar territory that has been etched out in previous cinematic adaptations, but also effectively revisits the mythos of Batman and the fear surrounding the dark knight that makes him such a fan favourite. Early on in his crime-fighting career, Bruce juggles intimidation tactics and the conflict between the streets and the empty family home - never before has a cinematic Batman skipped the double murder in the alley and instead shown a torn Bruce Wayne bargaining at his parent's grave, struggling to reconcile his promise to clean up Gotham's grime and his desire for romance and a normal life. When he proposes to Andrea he gets more than a telling sign, an ominous column of bats curling and fluttering into the sky like the first ever bat signal. The ending suggests more of the same; that Bruce Wayne and Batman are two separate entities, that only one of them can truly exist in more than empty shape and form, and that other figures have also experienced similar tragedies and conflicts. The true success of Phantasm is being able to tie these difficult questions into what the caped crusader is truly beloved for: a hammy superhero with an entire arsenal of gadgets and gizmos who fully embraces what he is. The Batman figure has always been a little bit ridiculous - why not go with it? What will endless vengeance solve? It's a good question for an adult in a bat costume, but aside from trying to answer it, there's also classical action taken straight from the animated series and the comic books they are based on, with the type of hits and blows where you can almost visualise the outlines of the 'KA-POW' on the screen. The set pieces are appropriate; the huge, full moon illuminating the city, and the Batman and his arch-rival posed like giants as they battle in the model future world exhibit. Mark Hamill is the voice behind the excellent Joker, who might be the only super-villain able to make brandishing an electric mixer even remotely menacing. With his wide grimaces and infamous cackle, Hamill turns any fight sequence into a heightened battle of the wits, alternating one-liners and swinging fists. Shirley Walker's brass- heavy theme is reminiscent of Danny Elfman's from the Burton movie, retaining most of its grandiose, darkness and mystery as the opening surveys the city skyline. And Kevin Conroy's steely tones are worthy of being included in the best of the on-screen Batman portrayals. He's just, formidable, unwavering - until he is confronted with a glimpse of a second chance at a different life.",

            "content": "I guess to some viewers, \"Mask of the Phantasm\" probably would be nothing more than an extended episode of the Batman animated series from the nineties, but considering that said series was excellent (In fact, I consider it to be the best adaptation of the Batman comics ever made) this movie obviously doesn't disappoint, establishing the foundations for the future films inspired by that character, particularly the trilogy directed by Christopher Nolan and later Batman animations (such as \"Batman: Under the Red Hood\", which in my humble opinion isn't as a good as this)Personally, I'm actually impressed of how dark and mature this film was, specially in comparison with other animated film done in the same year. In many ways, it was way ahead of its time, daring to be surprisingly gritty and solemn in way in which no other Batman film (Not even those directed by Tim Burton) was before.The animation is dark and brooding, the characters are fleshed out and complex, and the plot is very deep and compelling. The viewer is given a true insight into the troubled psyche of Batman, the archetypal Byronic hero and the continuous tribulations that afflict his life as a superhero, from his complicated relationship with Andrea to his inner conflicts with his level of responsibility and his uncertainty that arises from it.One scene in particular - in which Bruce kneels at his parents' grave and begs them to let him live his own life - gets me a tad choked up every time I see it. This is powerful, serious drama, as any Batman story should be.Batman: Mask of the Phantasm is a fantastic film, which I highly recommend to any fan of Batman, the DCAU, and animation in general.",

Alfred hands it to him. the main theme starts up and there is a pause as Bruce stares at the mask briefly, possibly thinking, this is the only way now. the camera goes to a close view of Bruce's lower torso, Alfred still in the background watching. Bruce puts on the mask, Alfred looking a bit unsure. Bruce turns and Alfred gasps in shock. the main theme picks up into more of a choir theme and batman's eyes are shown up close, those white eyes in the darkness. he narrows them.

The writing is top-notch, in no-way predictable and the voice acting by Kevin Conroy as Batman and Mark Hamill as the Joker truly amazing and bone-chillingly scary.The only complaints is that the animation could have been better at some points, but that is because it was originally meant to be a straight to video release before Warner's saw what a masterpiece they had created, and also it should have run for a little bit longer, but oh well.

Sophisticated, dark and somewhat unique, I think it improves on the animation of the series slightly. The colours are bold, and the character designs are sharp and decisive. The music is wonderful too, it is quite a complex score even for Batman but it is always memorable whether it is the choruses or the rousing orchestral music.The story is what makes Mask of the Phantasm so good. It is structured similarly to those of some of the plot lines of the series but just as fresh and as compelling with a lot of great scenes particularly the wonderfully poetic opening sequence. The writing is superb, very mature and intelligent, and the pace and characters are spot on. Batman especially is a revelation, dark, brooding and charismatic. The voice acting is terrific, with Kevin Conroy actually embodying the character and Mark Hamill once again phenomenal as Joker.All in all, an amazing animated film and one of the best Batman films to date. 9/10 Bethany Cox",

I loved the flash back on this film it tells u the story of Bruce Wayne before becoming THE DARK KNiGHT and the LOVE OF HIS LIFE.The Love Story was made in a very professional way thanks to the writers, Kevin Conroy & Dana Delany who performed the voice of the two leading character (Bruce Wayne and Andrea Beaumont) and the brave Directors who had done a brave job by turning this TV version into a fantastic theatrical version. and who could forget the magnificent Mark Hamill as the joker who stole many scenes by his fabulous performance.For me this is my number one Romantic Film along side (GWTW 1939,Atonement(2007)and now voyager 1942).there are unforgettable scenes on this movie The rain scene when Bruce talks to his dead parents grave and Andrea came to him ( That was my favorite one) and when they first saw each other after 10 years, and the first spoken scene between each other and of course the final scene for both Andrea and Batman.The Final song \"I Never Even Told You\" bye Tia Carrere was one of my favorite song all the time.I wish if in the future they would made a new version of this film with real actors.Finally I recommended this film for everyone who is had once a love in his life or having a new one now.",

Now, \"Batman: Mask of the Phantasm\" is not only the best Batman animated movie, but it is one of my favorite Batman movies along side with Tim Burton's classic 1989 movie and the awesome trilogy by Christopher Nolan. This movie gets so overlooked, and it deserves to be talked about as it has already become a cult classic. The movie centers around Bruce Wayne's past about as he once had a love one named Andre Beaumont as they were going to spend the rest of their lives together. Sadly, Andre breaks up with Bruce as he now turns himself into the Dark Knight to fight crime. During the present, the mysterious figure known as the Phantasm hunts down some of the crime bosses as Batman is being framed and goes out to find who the Phantasm really is. What can I say? Of course, you know the movie is based on a popular animated TV series which it is without a doubt one of the greatest animated shows about Batman. The movie is definitely larger than life as the movie went into theaters instead of being straight to video as it was originally intended. The movie open to great reviews, but did not perform well at the box-office due to how bad the marketing went. However, it did well for being success as it was first released on both VHS and Laser discs. I have it on VHS, and now I have it on DVD. Unfortunately, it has never been released on Blu-Ray yet which I will get to that later. I thought the animation is incredible as it does add a stylish look into as it represents what the comic books were. Also, the story is perfectly well told for showing the psychology of Bruce Wayne and following the path of becoming Gotham's greatest protector. The direction by Eric Radomski and Bruce W. Timm is absolutely top notch perfect. The voice acting is indeed perfect. Kevin Conroy does a heck of a job to voice both Bruce Wayne and Batman, as well as Mark Hamill for voicing the Joker. Of course, the late Gene Siskel from Siskel&Ebert did not like Hamill's voice, but that is his opinion. At least both Siskel and Roger Ebert gave the movie a two thumbs up which it deserves to. Dana Delany has also done a great job for voicing Bruce Wayne's love interest. The movie is 76 minutes long which it does go by at a very good pace, when it does keep you interest with the story and characters. I do love Shirley Walker's music which it is whether or not one of her greatest achievements. Now, about this movie for not being released on Blu Ray. Like Disney's remake of \"Mighty Joe Young,\" the movie does need another release on DVD as well as an official release on Blu Ray; it needs a heck of a restoration for cleaning up the movie's transfer, but no DNR like what Fox did to \"Predator\" because if it did then it will loose some of its textures and details. Warner Bros. needs to be faithful on how this movie looks, and maybe have it be supervised by Bruce W. Timm and some of the people that work on this movie. Also, the DVD only has a trailer but no audio commentary from the cast and crew as well as having deleted scenes, still galleries, maybe other trailers and TV spots and most of all a documentary on how the film was when it came to make a Batman animated feature film as it went from straight to video to theaters, and how the marketing turned out to be a huge disappointment but thanks to the fans for having it become a cult film. There is a petition that I found online, which I did sign it and I hope that Warner Bros. release this movie on DVD again, and making an official Blu Ray release with an all new video transfer with sound and an amount of special features. If you aren't interested to sign it, that is fine and I am not going to be upset or anything like that. I just want this to be release as soon as possible. If you are interest, then that will be wonderful. I will put the link on it whether you are interest to sign the petition to have this movie be released on Blu Ray. With that said, \"Batman: Mask of the Phantasm\" is the most absolute Batman animated movie of all time, and it will continue to be a classic movie. I give it a 10 out of 10.Here is the link for the petition: http://www.ipetitions.com/petition/release-batman-mask-of-the- phantasm-on-blu-ray For a reminder, if the link has issues just type the movie's name with petition on Google so that it will take you there.

            "content": "A bit of an obscure \"Batman\" release, it is the second of two films that were based on popular television series (the first being 1966's \"Batman: The Movie\"), and it is the first of two theatrical animated films based on the character (the second being 2017's \"The Lego Batman Movie\").This one's based off the successful \"Batman: The Animated Series\" from the 1990s. I've always heard good things about it, but I've never gotten around to watching it. This movie might be a bad introduction for me into the series.To start off, there's practically no plot here. I mean, yeah, we have Batman (Kevin Conroy) running around and trying to figure out the mystery of who this \"Phantasm\" character is (a new villain created specifically for this movie). The problem is that this villain is completely uninteresting. Only when we learn their secret identity later on in the movie, then they become only somewhat mildly interesting. The Phantasm goes about Grim Reaper style, executing different criminals while telling them \"it's time to die.\" Bruce/Batman also has a love interest here, Andrea Beaumont (Dana Delany), who was also created for this movie. Interesting to see Batman finally try to settle down with a woman, but this doesn't really go anywhere.Another issue with the storytelling is that there are so many flashback sequences, a really bland way to tell a story. It's mostly used to give us some context on Bruce and Andrea's relationship. It's very confusing sometimes because there's only a one second dream transition effect that swaps us between flashback and current reality. Maybe if these sequences were in black and white it would have been a little easier to follow. Still doesn't excuse the fact that flashbacks are lazy and boring.The saving grace here is Mark Hamill. I've always loved him as the Joker. It's amazing the talent they've had playing that character all these years: Hamill, Nicholson, Ledger, Phoenix. Anyways, Hamill is the best part of this movie.The animation is also very nice to look at. It pulls the movie up to passable mediocrity. I also like some of the dark and mature themes here. It's still a kid's movie, so you won't see anything as dark or mature as in something like \"Batman Returns\", but it's cool to know that this movie wasn't strictly intended for children.This movie was originally intended to be a direct-to-video release, and it kind of shows. I wrote this review because it kind of shocked me how much praise was being heaped onto it. A mild curiosity for fans, and it offers very little to just about everybody else.",

This is a great movie because it doesn't really reference the show even to make the audience confused as to what is going on. Then again, I guess everyone is so familiar with the Batman mythology there's probably no reason to do that anyway. The best thing about this is the fantastic animation. It makes me miss the days where every beloved animated show got a theatrically released movie based on it, but now most TV shows haven't switched to CGI like movies. It's easily the best movie I've seen for Superhero Month. Another great thing is how well this film works as an origin story.True, it doesn't show Batman's direct origin, but we get to see through flashbacks a gradual change that makes Bruce Wayne don the costume. It's great to see him actually propose to someone, although we all know it didn't work out. I had in fact heard of the twist ending, but it's still tons of fun to watch. It truly did remind me of the classic Max Fleischer superhero cartoons and how beautifully animated they were (although they did stuff with Superman, not Batman). My only complaint is that the movie is too short! It was so epic I wanted to see more! Still, it's definitely worth your time and probably my second favorite Batman movie next to \"The Dark Knight\". ***1/2",

            "content": "Batman: The Animated Series is superb, one of the best TV shows I've ever seen. It is incredibly consistent in quality with its excellent writing, voice-acting, animation and music (really powerful and gorgeous). New characters were created (Harley Quinn), deeper back- stories were developed (Mr. Freeze) and countless other ideas were first seen in this series to later become an integral part of the Batman mythology. Its tone found a perfect midpoint between the darkness usually associated with Batman and a children's action cartoon; both adults and kids can enjoy it. And this feature film lives up to all of those standards in a very satisfying way.There are many twists and turns in the plot of Batman: Mask of the Phantasm. Like The Usual Suspects, you'll probably think you're clever for guessing certain things only to find you were way off the mark. The story is original although the Phantasm is apparently based on the Reaper from Batman: Year Two. There are many flashbacks that give insight into Bruce's personal evolution and struggle as Batman. They tie-in to the events of the movie naturally.There are many little moments of humour, especially between Alfred and Bruce (or when Bruce is in public with his playboy persona). Their banter is often understated and hilarious. It's not based on shallow gags but centred on the characters so it has a long-term resonance. The more you see of them, the stronger and more entertaining their relationship becomes.The action is really well done. It's not just the same every time, there's always creativity like in a James Bond or Jackie Chan movie. Batman might have to avoid the police while also chasing a suspect or grab and use an unexpected weapon or dodge bombs thrown at him or have to create an impromptu distraction, etc. All the same, he still manages to constantly beat up thugs and outsmart his opponents. And of course, he always has to find a way to fight without ever killing anyone, his most fundamental rule.Speaking of which, the film-makers are clearly passionate about Batman and all of the mythology and fiction that's been created over the years about him and Gotham. They are true to it, honour and respect what they like best about it and regularly take it in new and interesting directions.This is actually a fairly sad and reflective movie. There's plenty of action but it has personal themes and probably more depth than a first viewing would allow one to properly absorb. And that's infinitely better than if it was just another entertaining but typical action movie. It will surely continue to grow in stature over time. Batman is perhaps the most popular superhero of all time (he's certainly my favourite) and here he is aptly represented in a very original and self-contained story. It's rare for love, expertise and talent to come together like this.",

Also, the Joker figures into the plot nicely. The best Batman animated movie to date. Not surprising since this came out as the brilliant \"Batman: The Animated Series\" was on television redefining awesome. If you loved that series, you will love this. It's not perfect. The identity of the Phantasm is fairly obvious despite their red herring attempts. But it captures what made the series work so well: the appeal to both kids and adults by using simple storytelling devices and animation but still being intelligent and emotional enough to make it more than just mindless action or silliness. The main problem with most of the DCAU movies today is that they can't seem to strike that right balance anymore. They're either too dumb for adults to like or too hyper-violent and crass for kids to even be watching. Mostly they seem to settle on only appealing to teenage boys. But the '90s series had cross-generational appeal and this movie is a good appetizer for that main course.",

Despite being a feature-length narrative, it doesn't discard its original roots, and is a deliriously dark adventure crafted with style & composure.There is enough mystery & action in the final print to keep the interest alive, and the several flashbacks it has in store only add extra depth to the events unfolding in the present. However, the nonlinear arrangement could've used a bit more streamlining. Its 75 mins runtime is finely paced, and voice work from the actors is commendable.Overall, Batman: Mask of the Phantasm remains one of the best portraits of Batman on film, features a better quality story than most of its live-action counterparts and is more than capable of surprising the newcomers even today. One doesn't need to be well-versed with the animated series to enjoy this film, but it does enrich the viewing experience by a slight margin. A definite recommend.",

Batman is being blamed for a series of high-profile murders in Gotham and the police quickly turn against him. In reality, the Phantasm is the one killing the mobsters. Andrea (Bruce's former love) flies into Gotham weeks after the murders begin.She triggers several flashbacks throughout the story that show us the events that led to Bruce becoming Batman. This includes the incredibly sad movement that prompts Bruce to don the cowl.

Kevin Conroy is THE voice of Batman.\"The series was widely praised for its thematic complexity, darker tone, artistic quality and modernization of its title character's crime-fighting origins. IGN listed The Animated Series as the best adaptation of Batman anywhere outside of comics, the best comic book cartoon of all time and the second best animated series of all time (after The Simpsons). Wizard magazine also ranked it #2 of the greatest animated television shows of all time (again after The Simpsons). TV Guide ranked it the seventh Greatest Cartoon of All Time (out of 60).

And when you consider just how much the filmmakers got right, you'll see that's not an exaggeration. \"Batman: Mask of the Phantasm\" is based on \"Batman: The Animated Series\" - so right there, you know it benefits from incredible voice casting, production design, and a tone that's just right.What's remarkable about \"Mask of the Phantasm\" is that it dares to be both a love story, and an origin story, coming in the wake of the Tim Burton blockbusters which handled both subjects rather poorly. The movie traces Bruce Wayne's relationship to Andrea Beaumont (Dana Delaney), his very first love; a relationship that blossomed at the very beginning of Bruce's career as Batman (told through flashbacks). When Bruce is not reminiscing, he's dealing with a new menace in Gotham; one who's taking out the city's crime bosses, one at a time. The demonic vigilante (the eponymous Phantasm) has a look that's mistaken by the police for Batman, putting the Dark Knight on the run, as he struggles to solve the mystery of why Gotham's organized crime is tumbling like a house of cards, and who's behind the murderous mask.I consider \"Batman: The Animated Series\" to be the greatest treatment of Batman we've seen, so far. They nailed everything: the score (the late, great Shirley Walker can go toe-to-toe with Danny Elfman), the writing, the voices (you won't find a better Batman or Joker than right here . . . hell, even Alfred or all of Batman's rogues gallery, for that matter), the mood, the production design (gotta love that \"dark deco\"), all of it. But just seeing a Bruce-centric storyline just puts this film head-and-shoulders above the rest, for me. And in a film that's well-acted and beautiful to look at, no less. It's a rock-solid script that delivers a great mystery, great characterization and even some nail-biting suspense. And just seeing how the writers manage to fit the Joker into the film's goings-on (without shoehorning) goes to show that these people were out to tell a great Batman story.And they went above and beyond.9/10",

The Joker is as crazy as ever, the thugs and hoods are as nasty as they have always been and the identity of the Phantasm surprised me. Although much of Danny Elfman's theme is missing the music is still powerful and involving. The animation is very good and has many elaborate 'sets' and locations.

The Warner Brothers market it for only two weeks before its opening week and remember is 1993 and the internet exist ,but is far from the omega high way of information we all know , and this had as a result many never either learn about it only months or years later when a lot of people rent or buy it of rent shores!!!

The reason for that is that after this economic fail ,studios in general stopped investing to them and it does seem that this trend continues, because apart from the Incredibles that came out in 2004 and Big Hero 6 in 2014 ,animated capes and cowls are few and far in between.With the sequel to the Incredibles coming out in 2017 in hope that more movies like that are going to be made and now more than twenty years later I believe that studios have learn their lesson. It speaks for itself the fact that we know about Incredibles 2 a year before it came out. So go want this movie and if you want a second opinion ,trust me has quite a cult following so is not to difficult to find a person to say to you that is good. Have fun :).",

            "content": "Batman: Mask of the Phantasm is a great animated movie where we find our beloved caped crusader facing an unknown and mysterious persona, the Phantasm. I watched this movies after I finished enjoying the Batman Animated Series and it captures everything we love about Batman. We get to see the greatest detective in the world in action, following the lead of a couple of mysterious murders for which he is wrongly accused. We get to see some interesting back story about Bruce Wayne in his early days of becoming the Dark Knight. Kevin Conroy as the voice of Batman will always be my favourite and Mark Hamill as the Joker is exceptional and without an equal. I recommend this movie to all Batman fans and to everybody who enjoys a great animation with a captivating story.I give 10 to all the movies I've seen because I don't like grades, all I can say is I AM BATMAN !",

            "content": "I honestly had not seen this movie until a friend of mine recommended it to me. As a die-hard fan of the 90s show as well as Batman in general, I had to check this one out. And this film delivered way beyond my expectations. Even though many will brush it aside due to it being an animated film, this movie has enough atmosphere and depth to match up to its live-action counterparts. The animation itself is just as incredible as the TV series', obviously seeing as it is was made by the same cast and crew for the most part. The artwork is still the gorgeously dark color pallet used for the show, and to extremely good effect. The score by Shirley Walker still uses the good old Danny Elfman theme as its base but she goes in a lot of directions with it. Every second of the music is just ominous, heroic and ultimately awesome.The voice acting is pure bad-ass, with the always appreciated Kevin Conroy as the Dark Knight, and Mark Hamill as the demented Joker.Both do superbly. Also, Efrem Zimbalist Jr. is great as Alfred and Dana Delany, who would go on to voice Lois Lane in the \"Superman\" TV series also headed by Bruce W. Timm, does excellently as well. The story offers plenty of great dialogue, speaking of which, it's simply put one of the most outstanding pieces of writing I've seen in the animation genre. The story being told is dark, involving and gives the characters greatly needed depth. It moves briskly, but never fails to build tension until it finally answers the question of just who is behind the grisly murders. Along the way, you will see Bruce Wayne's trail to become the Caped Crusader in one of the best tellings of this particular tale. Few of the live action Batman films have touched upon the hero's origin's as so in this film. All of the characters are very interesting, and all are intertwined beautifully. Hamill will always be the Joker to me. The best line in the entire movie, to me anyways for purely sentimental reasons, would be when Joker viciously says \"Don't touch me, old man!\", but then almost light heartedly and comically adds \"I don't know where you've been.\" It's just great to see.So, in the end, the movie has great artwork, solid characterization, a very intriguing mystery storyline all backed by a thundering and magnificent score. I won't spoil the conclusion of it all, because I'm sure there are plenty of others out there who have yet to experience this great movie.",

            "content": "Batman Mask of the Phantasm is easily my favorite Batman movie to date. Batman the animated series is my favorite incarnation of Batman. This is based off of that show, which plays a big part in why I love this film.Firstly, Kevin Conroy's Batman is my favorite incarnation of Batman. He has this presence that, in my opinion has never been topped by any other Batman put to screen. This film delves into his origins and the reason he became Batman, which factor greatly in the story. I really liked what they did with Batman' origin. In my opinion, his origin is handled better here than in even Batman Begins.I also like Bruce's love interest, Andrea. She is different from most love interests in Batman. She strong and she can take care of herself. I also really bought into their love story, which also plays a big part in the. What I never liked about Batman films and superhero films in general, is that the love interests feel very tacked-on and forced as an attempt to bring in a broader audience. Here the love story is one of the driving factors of the movie.The Phantasm is a good villain. In fact, he is probably one of my favorite Batman villains. I loved the mystery surrounding the Phantasm. The way everything is unveiled is expertly done. The mystery is very complex, which is something you do not see in a lot of kids films, or even adult films. The Joker also appears in this. He is not the main villain, but definitely had a significant role to play. Mark Hamill's Joker is my favorite incarnation of the Joker. Like Kevin Conroy, Mark has a presence to him as the Joker that has never been topped, in my opinion.The art and animation is great. It feels very cinematic. The film has a great atmosphere. The score is beautiful. Most of the music is from the animated series, but there is some new music here. Like the animated series, this movie takes a darker tone. This movie, like the animated series, treated its audience more like adults than the live action Batman movies coming out at the time.Overall, for anyone who is a fan of Batman, this is a must see. I think it is criminal that this film bombed at the box office when it was in theaters, while the childish Schumacher Batman films made all of the money. However, it made back its budget with the video sales, which I am grateful for. This is easily one of the best Batman movies ever made!",

The character of Batman was nuanced, the plots diverse and multi-faceted, the animation innovative. It defined who Batman was for an entire generation of kids and is, in my opinion, superior to even the Blockbuster Nolan version of the hero.This movie continued that trend. While it shares many similarities with the series (from the animation to the director to the voice actors), it is more than simply a long episode. The plot is engaging and doesn't feel stretched to fit a full-length movie time frame. It was the first of many direct-to-video animated superhero movies and set the bar for those which followed.Although perhaps not perfect, I would rank this movie as one of the top Batman movies and thus top superhero movies ever. For anyone who enjoys superheroes, Batman, comic books, or simply excellent animated movies, I would highly recommend this!",

            "content": "Batman: The Animated Series was a highly successful cartoon on television, based on the DC Comics and Bob Kane creation, winning an Emmy award for the episode \"Robin's Reckoning\", the makers decided to make a full-length feature film (originally it was to go straight-to-video, but it was released in cinemas), it is often ranked as one of the best movies featuring the Caped Crusader. Basically, in Gotham City, Batman aka Bruce Wayne (Kevin Conroy) breaks up a meeting crime bosses concerning money laundering, led by Chuckie Sol (Gremlins' Dick Miller). When Sol tries to escape, he is confronted by a cloaked figure, the \"Phantasm\", who causes him to speed out of control and fatally crash his car into a building. Witnesses see Batman at the scene, it is believed he killed Sol, and city councilman Arthur Reeves (Hart Bochner) vows to have him arrested. During a party at Wayne Manor, Bruce is reminded by Reeves of his former lover, Andrea 'Andi' Beaumont (Dana Delany), and has flashback of their time together ten years ago. Young Bruce met Andrea at Gotham Cemetery, where their parents' graves are located, and they begin a relationship. Bruce has been wanting to clean up crime in Gotham for some time, following the murder of his parents, and makes his first attempt at crime-fighting one night. While he succeeds in foiling robberies, he is discouraged that the criminals do not fear him. Bruce becomes conflicted about whether to commit to his relationship with Andrea or defend Gotham City to avenge his parents. Back in the present, Buzz Bronski (John P. Ryan), another gangster, is murdered by the Phantasm, with Bronski's bodyguards mistaking him for Batman. Batman investigates the scene of Bronski's death and encounters Andrea, inadvertently revealing his identity to her. In another flashback, Bruce chooses to propose marriage to Andrea, which she accepts. But then she mysteriously leaves Gotham with her father, businessman Carl Beaumont (Stacy Keach), only leaving her engagement ring and letter to forget about her. Heartbroken, Bruce completes his transformation as a crimefighter, makes a suit, and becomes Batman. Returning to the present, Batman finds evidence linking Sol, Bronski and a third gangster, Salvatore Valestra (Abe Vigoda), along with Andrea's father, and finds a photograph of the four together in Valestra's home. The now-elderly Valestra, who suffers from a breathing condition due to heavy smoking, is paranoid that Batman will come for him next. Reeves is corrupt and on the mob's payroll, Valestra asks him for help, but is refused. In desperation, Valestra visits the Joker (Star Wars' Mark Hamill) and offers $5 million to kill Batman. The Joker initially agrees to help Valestra but betrays him and exposes him to his deadly venom. The Phantasm goes to kill Valestra at his mansion, only to find him dead with a permanent smile, and a camera that Joker has placed to identify the gangster murderer. The Phantasm escape before a bomb is detonated and is then pursued by Batman in the Batwing. Batman leaps out and they fight before the Phantasm disappears. Moments later, the police ambush Batman and chase him through the city to a construction site. Batman is eventually saved from arrest by Andrea who found out his predicament from television. Bruce wants to know the truth about Andrea's father, she explains that he embezzled money from Valestra and was forced to repay it. Carl and Andrea went on the run, he was able to pay back the money, but the gangsters demanded more and put a hit on Carl, and Bruce assumes that he is the man in the costume. Bruce and Andrea rekindle their romantic relationship. After Andrea has left, Bruce takes another look at Valestra's photograph again, and recognises one of Valestra's men as the Joker, who was his driver before becoming the clown criminal he is. The Joker confronts Reeves, knowing his connections with the mob, believing he may know something about the Phantasm. The Joker confirms that Batman is not the murderer and poisons Reeves with venom. Driven insane, Reeves is taken to the hospital, where Batman interrogates him. Reeves, who worked as Carl's accountant before going into politics, confesses he helped the Beaumonts escape but told Valestra their location in exchange for the funding needed to launch his first campaign. Both Batman and Joker deduce that the Phantasm is Andrea, she wants to wipe out the Valestra mob for killing her father and ruining her chance to marry Bruce. It is revealed that the Joker (as a regular criminal in the past) killed Andrea's father; she tracks him down to his hideout, the abandoned Gotham World Fair amusement park. They fight, with the Joker luring her out and into the path of a powerful giant fan, but Batman arrives on the Batcycle and saves her. Batman begs Andrea to end her vigilante vengeance, but she refuses to listen, he tells her to leave. Batman pursues the Joker through the amusement park, and they fight. Joker has wired the place to explode, he is seized by Andrea, who bids Batman goodbye. As the place blows up, Andrea and the Joker disappear, while Batman barely escapes the blast. Bruce is later consoled by his loyal butler Alfred (Efrem Zimbalist Jr.) in the Batcave, who assures him Andrea could not have been helped. Bruce finds Andrea's locket containing a picture of them together. Andrea leaves the city on a boat feeling sorrow. It ends with a saddened Batman standing on the edge of a building, he sees the Bat-Signal shining in the sky, meaning he has been cleared of the accusations against him, he resumes crimefighting. Also starring Bob Hastings as Commissioner James Gordon, and Total Recall's Robert Costanzo as Detective Harvey Bullock, and Arleen Sorkin as Mrs. Bambi, with various additional voices by Charlie Adler, Jeff Bennett, Bob Bergen, Nancy Cartwright, Bill Farmer, Ed Gilbert, Jess Harnell, Casey Kasem, Maurice LaMarche, Neil Ross, and B. J. Ward. Conroy is fantastic as the voice of the Dark Knight, Hamill with his iconic maniacal laugh is superb as the Joker, and Delany, Keach and others are well chosen for their voice roles. I watched this many times when I was younger, it was often shortened and cut on television (I had no idea), so I'm glad when I finally saw the full version as it was supposed to be. The stylish animation is excellent, it is an interesting well written story, with the hero origins, a romantic plot and the mystery, there is something for all the family to enjoy, no matter how many times you watch it, an exciting and fantastic animated superhero action. Batman was number 84 on The 100 Greatest Pop Culture Icons. Very good!",

            "content": "Animation is all too often written off as being excursively for children. Yet occasionally there comes along something that, while ostensibly for children, that works perhaps better for adults who might be watching. Batman: The Mask Of The Phantasm (and the TV series Batman: The Animated Series it was spawned from) are perfect example of that. While there's plenty of action in it, the story is full of details and depth that adults would pick up on. The result is an action story with a surprising amount of characterization and plot that puts head and shoulders above many other films both animated and live action.Much of the films success is done to the voice casting, many of whom reprise their roles for the TV series. Kevin Conroy has proved himself to be practically definitive with his performances as Batman/ Bruce Wayne over the years and this film is no exception. In fact, this film takes Conroy's performance as Batman one step further as we learn of his lost love and how the past continues to haunt this man. The result is a Batman that, while a man of action, is very much human as well and the film is all the better for it.The rest of the voice casting is splendid as well. Dana Delany gives a moving performance as Wayne's lost love Andrea 'Andi' Beaumont whose past relationship with Wayne, and the secrets surrounding it, lie at the heart of the film. Character actor Stacy Keach gives a fine performance as Andrea's banker father as well as supplying the voice of the mysterious Phantasm. Hart Bochner gives a fine, if somewhat over the top performance as the sleazy Gotham City Councilman Arthur Reeves who orders the hunt for Batman. There's also the performances of Abe Vigoda, Dick Miller and John P. Ryan as the mobsters being hunted by the Phantasm. Not forgetting those who reprise their roles from the TV series such as Efrem Zimbalist Jr. as Alfred, Bob Hastings as Commissioner Gordon and Robert Costanzo as Detective Harvey Bullock or of course even Mark Hamill as Batman's arch-nemesis The Joker who gives a menacing, yet maniacal, performance that's become a trademark of the animated series. All together they round out the film's excellent cast.The films animation is as fine as well. Using the same animation style as the TV series it was spawned from, the story is perfectly set in a world of shadows where the modern exists blended seamlessly in with art deco influences. This is used to good effect both in the film's flashbacks and its finale as well with the use of a World's Fair like exhibition that serves a fine metaphor for the story as well. The animation, coupled with the score of Shirley Walker, helps brings the world of the film to life.It is perhaps the films story that is its biggest highlight. The TV series was praised for not dumbing down its stories and the film is no exception. As I wrote at the beginning, this is a film with plenty of action in it with a story full of details and depth that adults would pick up on. Mask Of The Phantasm uses its expanded length to go into back-story that the TV series could never do and the result is a film the is as much as tale of love and loss as it is an action film with rooftop chases, fist fights and the like. There is a genuine love story between Bruce and Andrea and it is that love, its loss and secret consequences that are at the films heart. Yet all the while, Batman finds that the city he's sworn to protect hunting him due to the deaths of mobsters at the hands of the mysterious Phantasm which brings the action and love story together for the films incredible revelations and its finale. The result is one of the best written Batman films yet written.Overall, Batman: The Mask Of The Phantasm is one example of what animation can do at its best. This is thanks to many elements such as Kevin Conroy's haunted performance of Batman to the fine supporting cast, fine animation, the score of Shirley Walker and one of the best Batman scripts yet written. The result is a film that is, for all intents and purposes, head and shoulders above many other films both animated and live action.",

            "content": "This is one of the greatest batman feature films of all-time. I'm a big batman fan and I love the animated series, it's one of the greatest interruption of the iconic character. This is a perfect feature film spin-off to the classic series. This film works well as an addition to the animated series as well as a stand alone film. You don't really need to see the cartoon series to watch this film. Bruce Timm, Paul Dini and co. took full advantage of this being a feature film and not an episode of the series. The background animation is much better here with the use of some cgi, Gotham city looks great and bigger then in the series. The new opera music at the beginning(instead of the classic Danny Elfman score)is great! It's really powerful and haunting and really brings you right into the movie from the start and let's you know that this isn't the cartoon series. But the best thing about this movie is the very, very well written story. It's very serious and mature and not watered down for kids. The best thing about the story is that it explores more about Bruce Wayne's past and it ties nicely to the events of the present. The other great thing about the story is that it introduces a new villain and an interesting one too. The main villain is \"The phantasm\" a mysterious ghost of Christmas future looking figure that is killing old mobsters. People think that it's batman killing the mobster. The story is very much a murder mystery that unravels nicely through out the film. The plot twist that the phantasm is really Andrea may not be brilliant or that hard to figure out but still works well for the over plot. Batman meets a woman from his past named Andrea Boumont. Which gives reason for us to have some flashbacks and the best thing about them is how they tie Andrea into Bruce's decision or destiny to become batman. I love how we see a young Bruce Wayne who had dedicated his life to avenge his parents by fighting crime but he meets Andrea and begins to fall in love and how that throws a monkey wrench into his plans of fighting crimes. It's all done very well and you feel for Bruce more here then any other time. I love how they showed his inflictions, what should he do? No matter what carry on his vowel to his parents or abandon them for a chance of a normal life? The scene where Bruce Wayne's is at his parent's grave asking forgiveness in the rain and Andrea shows up and says \"maybe they sent me\" is so touching and powerful. I know it's required for Bruce to have a love interest but Andrea Boulmount is probably the best because she has much more depth then your average love interest. They do a great job at making her an mirror image of batman of what batman could've become. Every night batman walks that fine line between vengeance and justice but Andrea is out for pure vengeance and one of my favorite scenes is at the end where we see Andrea is on a cruise boat after getting her revenge and killed all the mobsters who killed her dad and a guy ask \"sorry, do you want to be alone?\" and Andrea responses \"I am alone\". Showing even after getting her revenge it didn't make her any happier. It's also nice to see a strong female villain who actually kills. I love the 1940's like mobster aspect to this story which always works perfectly for batman. This movie is allowed to be more edgier then the series so people are killed and the main mob boss from the past, Sal Velstra smokes cigarettes which they couldn't really do in the series and I liked the idea of him being sick as an old man due to his smoking. Kevin Connerlly is once again great as the voice of batman. And I like that the story takes a different approach from other batman movies. It's not really about batman saving the city from a villain. It's a more personal fight for batman, he's being framed for murders and he's trying to save the moral center of a woman he once love. I also love when in a flashback Andrea told Bruce to \"forgett about her\" and that's the moment when Bruce knew that he had only one destiny, to be batman. And then there's the Joker, he didn't really need to be in this film but I'm glad he is because he adds a nice touch to the movie. They did a really good job at fitting him into the story and for once he's not the main villain. It's a nice twist where Joker was really minding his own business but is drawn into this story because he realizes that someone is killing off his old mob partners and he's next on the hit list. They do a good job at building mystery around how Joker fits into the mob killings and we find out that he's that young guy who acts as a bodyguard to mob boss Sal Vedlsta in the flashbacks and I like how they revealed that it was him who killed Andrea's father. I enjoyed seeing a little bit of Joker's past and how his own past has come back to haunt him. Joker is allowed to be more darker here and scarier then in the cartoon series. Joker is both funny and menacing. Mark Hammil's at his best as Joker's voice. He's on par with Nicholson and Ledger as the greatest Joker ever. I like when joker stars laughing when seeing the explosions. He should have died in this movie and if this was a stand alone he would have but I liked that they implied that Andrea did kill him. This is batman at his best!",

            "content": "'Batman: The animated series,' airing in the early to mid 90s, even today is a standard bearer of animation. The artists working on the show gave us backgrounds, facial expressions, and camerawork that was ahead of its time then, and still almost 30 years later remains unimpeachable and impressive. This is to say nothing of the incredible voice work, the retinue of talent that filled the cast of each episode, and the mainstays who helped to completely define certain characters for a new generation - Mark Hamill as The Joker, for one, and not least Kevin Conroy as Bruce Wayne and Batman. Witty dialogue and humor, smart scene and narrative writing, complex characters, and striking action sequences were consistently the order of the day. That studio executives should have sought to produce a full-length film based on the series isn't too surprising; that the project developed as it did is perhaps a little unexpected. 'Mask of the Phantasm' has enjoyed a considerable reputation ever since its premiere, and I'm a little embarrassed that it's taken me this long to get around to watching it. The wait was worth it, however, for just as one should assume based on the series from which it originates, this is outstanding.All the high quality we came to expect from the series absolutely holds true here, and all the staples of storytelling. As one may anticipate, this film does take a slightly different approach, enriching its narrative with elements that were unused or at least uncommon on network television. 'Phantasm' introduces a strong romantic aspect to its tale, and makes substantially more proliferate use of flashbacks to build the saga. Arguably more than before, the picture plays with themes of duty, promises, and being haunted by the past - and one might also say that the story contains heavier violence, or at least a darker tone, than was broadly true of the series (with notable exceptions). So, sure enough, we get something here that's very familiar, yet also grows something new and delicious from those roots.Of course, one could endlessly go over the details of the production, reflecting on this, that, and the other thing. Just as if not more importantly - the story is wonderfully sharp and absorbing; compelling, and even thrilling. All the hard work, energy, and care that went into the series, making it fresh and exciting at every turn, is unquestionably employed here just as well. Given those ways that the storytelling is somewhat expanded here, it's not wrong to say that the characters even feel a little more fleshed out and more real in 'Phantasm,' subsequently making the plot all the richer. Even the music gets an extra boost, becoming more dramatic, and for as quickly as the movie was developed and released, the animation almost seems even more grand. In every way, this is just terrific.In less than 80 minutes a story is told that is cohesive and complete, and fabulously satisfying, yet astoundingly concise. We're given details to round out the story, yet only exactly as much as is necessary to do so, and nothing ever takes priority over the action fun of the plot. It's safe to say that bloated, self-indulgent modern superhero blockbusters could stand to learn a lot by revisiting 'Batman: Mask of the Phantasm,' and frankly a lot of other features, too. It's no wonder why this is held in such high esteem; even now it's tighter and more engaging than much of what has followed in all the years since, even as technology and film-making sensibilities have changed. One could suppose that this might even appeal to those viewers who otherwise don't care for the towering complexity that is the MCU, or the dour dullness of DC's bedraggled concurrent foray into cinema. I'd stop short of saying 'Mask of the Phantasm' is a total must-see for one and all - yet among comic book flicks, it indisputably is. Standing tall all this time later, this is well worth seeking out to watch.",

            "content": "Though 'Batman: Mask Of The Phantasm (1993)' does feel suitably cinematic, it is still very much an extension of 'Batman: The Animated Series (1992)', taking place after the first season and having tangible consequences for the show as a whole. It is never so to the detriment of the narrative, however, rather the opposite. The feature builds upon the solid - and usually universally known - foundations of its source-material to craft a story all of its own, ultimately becoming both a superb stand-alone and a solid supplement, too. It's really a character-driven mystery at its heart and I will say that the enigma that fuels the piece is particularly well-handled, played to perfection at every moment. We learn just enough to keep us guessing but never enough so that the eventual reveal is too obvious (or, indeed, a cheat). It intertwines initially slightly slow and, wrongfully, unnecessary-seeming flashbacks into its plot, which cleverly filter the bat's backstory through relevant characters so that they strongly connect to the current-day narrative in more ways than one. The flick provides a strong emotional connection to every sequence, including a real sense of pain in the punch-ups and some real stakes overall, because the protagonist, sans mask, is given a lot more time and development than he usually is in his animated outings. This means that we care not only about the Dark Knight catching the crook but also about Bruce Wayne maybe finally finding some semblance of personal happiness, too. It's a brilliant balance and one key in the feature's success. It is one of the best Batman outings to come to our screens, big or small, and is a consistently enjoyable, engaging experience. It's entertaining, exciting and intriguing, an intelligent tale that takes itself seriously and makes you care about its characters. The animation and voice-work are both top-notch, too, and I'd say that this easily sits among the best of the Bat's big-screen adventures. 8/10",

            "content": "Ah, God bless the 1990's, frankly, it rocked growing up in this decade. I had The Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, Power Rangers, X-Men and Batman: The Animated Series. I remember waking up early every Saturday morning to see the new episode of Batman, it was such a great series was different against all the other cartoons, it was extremely dark and edgy, especially for a children's cartoon. That's one of the reasons I adore Batman, he's unlike any other super hero's we know, he not only has a reason for his dark side but can kick butt naturally, sorry, had to say it. So I didn't even realize that there was a movie that was made around the series called Batman: Mask of the Phantasm and I saw it on sale for five dollars and figured I'd give it a shot. One thing that confused me was how this movie was overlooked because it's such a terrific movie, the only thing I could assume is that during this time Batman Forever was also being released and this was animated so just disregarded sadly. But this is one of the best animated movies I have ever seen.During a conference of crime bosses held in a Gotham City skyscraper, gangster Chuckie Sol is killed by a mysterious cloaked figure shortly after Batman bursts in on the meeting. Batman is blamed for the death. In a flashback to Bruce's college days, we see him meet his old girlfriend Andrea in a cemetery while visiting his parents' grave. Bruce has vowed to avenge his parents' murder by dedicating his life to fighting crime. He dons a mask and black ninja-styled outfit and foils an armored car robbery, but is discouraged that the criminals do not fear him. Around the same time, he begins a romance with Andrea. Eventually, Bruce decides to quit his plan on becoming a crime-fighter and proposes marriage to Andrea. However, Andrea mysteriously leaves Gotham with her father, ending her engagement to Bruce. Believing that he has lost his only chance of having a normal life, Bruce finally dons the mask of Batman. In the present, the killer finds and kills another gangster, Buzz Bronski. Batman discovers evidence linking Beaumont with a number of organized crime figures. He discovers there may be more to the story of this masked phantom then he realizes.The whole feel of the film, if you were to just take the animation alone, this was superbly made. That's one of the reasons that the series was so well loved as well, just the whole atmosphere of the story was on track and you felt like you were in Gotham City. Even the acting was very good, this had a real old detective film feel to it, the love story between Andrea and Bruce was a perfect addition and it didn't over do their love, it was just perfect and had a good close to it. It was also great to have our beloved Joker in the mix of the story, how could we not include him? He's one of the greatest villains of all time. If you do get the chance to see Batman: Mask of the Phantasm, seriously take it, this is a very overlooked film and deserves all the credit it can possibly get.8/10",

Its only downfall was that the person portraying the Phantasm was a bit of a giveaway. Other than this though the film contained a strong and moving plot, which particularly put emphasis on the torture Batman has to go through for the girl he truly has feelings for that was a change from just him grieving over his parents. Unlike the cartoon the Joker was given a bit more origin and because of this he played an even more darker character, as he actually kills one of the mob bosses in terrifying circumstances. As a result he lost that silliness that the character was more based upon in the series. What the film does as well is that explores Batman's origin with a similar theme to Year One. The scene that will always be remembered is when Batman puts on the cowl for the first time, putting fear into Alfred. The score was absolutely fantastic, in many ways it is better than Elfman's and what gave it that edge was that it was a more climatic version to that of the series.Overall great plot and score, the way Batman should be portrayed.",

            "content": "I haven't seen the TV series that this film is based on, but \"Batman: Mask of the Phantasm\" has the hallmarks of boob-tube roots. Before shows such as \"The Sopranos\" made for a more-cinematic brand of screen viewing transmitted into our homes, most TV was almost entirely committed to only story and characters, which meant a lot of stagy talking. (Daytime soaps being the most notorious offenders.) And that's what we have here in this animated kiddie program that was released theatrically as an afterthought (it's been far more successful on the home video market, which is where most of these types of animated superhero movies went--and, now, streaming, which continues to replace the TV and video market). There's little to nothing in complex plot, subtext, innovative technique or even interesting visual design--the stuff that makes cinema art.Instead, this is much like Tim Burton's original \"Batman\" (1989), another picture I find overrated and which seems to be praised merely for presenting a relatively darker tone for the caped crusader. Both feature some appealing if brief and limited art design, but none of it's integrated with the focus on character-driven narrative in the way Burton's sequel, \"Batman Returns\" (1992) is. Here, we get a Gotham that's somewhat Art Deco--I suppose merely because it looks pleasing, which, indeed, the opening camera movement through the cityscape here is--but, for the most part, we're offered static backgrounds and sometimes shaded lighting to character chatter and story development. It's basically the same sort of animation that was possible in the original animated superhero film, \"Superman\" (1941), which may've been impressive then but is hardly so 50-plus years later.Like the 1989 \"Batman,\" there are two stories here, one set in the present world of Batman where a new villain emerges, and another a set of flashbacks that delve into how he became a vigilante who dresses as a bat. Inevitably, these two stories will converge in some revelation. In Burton's version, this involved the murder of Bruce's parents; here, it involves a past love. Burton also included a newspaper angle, which has always tended to work better as a meta-narrative device in Superman and Spiderman movies, where the protagonists have alter egos as journalists. At least, \"Mask of the Phantasm\" understands that Batman is a detective, but unfortunately the mystery here is as trite as a twist from a \"Law & Order\" episode.It doesn't help, either, that the story is dull and the characters simplistic outlines that aren't developed beyond shorthand clich\u00e9s of gangsters, lovers and orphans avenging dead parents. It only picks up a bit once the Joker enters the scene, thanks to a standout voice performance by Mark Hamill, and during the two relatively exciting sequences of the police chase and the climactic confrontation.",

Now I have been adding some Batman titles; I began with the Batman and Superman movie, a movie that I found just good by the way (later I will be writing on here a complete comment for that movie), and later I began to watch Batman Beyond, a series that I never watched before and that right now I'm enjoying a lot (soon I will be writing a full comment for Season 1). This was my next step and I must \"confess\" that I had never watched this movie before, now I'm really glad I watched it. This one does feel like a feature film; very soon there's a new problem for our Dark Knight since Chuckie Sol, a crime boss, has been killed and our hero is the one everybody is blaming of that killing. The past will come back to Bruce's mind and with that we will watch a love story before the Batman days, a love story that for Bruce ended in a very surprising and painful way, ended in the Dark Knight. Here we see again why Batman is quite unique since we see another person similar to Bruce Wayne. Both suffered the killing of their familiars and both were looking for revenge. That character is Andrea Beaumont, the girl of that love story before the Gotham Knight days. One of those important differences between Bruce and Andrea is the fact that Bruce at a point was going to stop being a vigilante for love. for the woman he loved. Andrea after suffering the killing of her father could not think in other thing but justice just like Bruce after she leaved him, then for an unknown circumstance, but the other difference is that Batman doesn't kill, the Phantasm does. There are great flashbacks but you may be wondering something like \"when does the fun begin?\" well the Joker is enough for you? Here the Joker has also an important place on the flashbacks, he is one of those that the Phantasm is looking for. Definitely when the Joker appears is when the fun and the best part of the movie begin. He is also another aspect to think by watching this, \"this one is actually something very special\".Batman: Mask of the Phantasm is like everything we could have expected from an animated movie of the Dark Knight. The beginnings of Batman, a present with gangsters fearing of Batman and the police (except Gordon of course) wanting to catch our hero, a mysterious new \"enemy\", a love story, a story about the family, justice, revenge and the Joker.

Each episode (or couple of episodes) acts as its own mini-movie. The structuring of the story in each one is just so well executed. As well, the animation (for its time) was quite good, and still holds up well enough today. Another difference from other animation, is that the color palette is quite dark- which, again, only makes it more interesting. All of the great villains are here (and others you may not have heard of), but they get a very serious and, at times, philosophical explication. One of my favorite things about the series, is that every episode has its own orchestral score- meaning, the music that you hear is tailored to fit the exact moment you are watching. Shirley Walker manages to come up with so many sub-themes and variations on the main theme- and works them in so well with the happenings on screen. For those of you that have seen the series and remember it fondly, you might be interested to know that a box-set of the first 28 episodes was recently released- you can get it just about anywhere.",

It doesn't feel like the same show, and has all the telltale beats of an average live action movie.Creating a new character like the Phantasm would be awesome if it was introduced in an episode and the story arc stretched out over a season, but to cram it an hour and half, it is such a cheap version of what it could be, I wouldn't have even bothered as it removes the option to do it correctly later.It was kind of nice to see the Joker, but if you're going to have him make an appearance, he might as well be the focus of the movie.Ultimately, any story that is more about Bruce Wayne than Batman outside the comics is just not going to be that entertaining.",

The animation is not very detail-oriented, but it does a very good job of showing the emotional drama and turmoil of the characters. Bruce Wayne is a man who finds himself torn in two: as Batman, he's a fearsome avenger of the night who is always alone and as Bruce Wayne, he's a rich fop and a womanizer who is also always alone. At a party, he thinks back on his first romantic love with a beautiful heiress named Andrea Beaumont and what his life could have been like with her. Andrea's reappearance coincides with the sudden arrival of (another) masked avenger named the Phantasm who is killing the mob bosses of Gotham \u0096 and letting Batman take the blame for the murders. The last mob boss, convinced that Batman has gone nuts and is murdering his old compadres, offers the Joker $5,000,000 to kill Batman\u0085an offer that the Joker gleefully accepts. So, you've got Batman battling the Joker, the Phantasm, and the Gotham PD who want to bring him in for murder. On top of that, he's got the emotional turmoil of reliving his first love and the reasons she left him\u0085and the fact that maybe he's tired of being Batman, that he wants a normal life but he still feels driven to work off the guilt of his parent's death and the pressure of the vow he made to them. It all collides at the old Gotham's World Fair in a spectacular animated fight sequence between Batman, the Joker, and the Phantasm. This is an animated film with an unusual amount of emotional weight and resonance that is balanced with a strong dose of action \u0096 a gem all the way.",

I don't mean any disrespect, is just that without that bit of context all commentary appears as deluded and mad. The best Batman movie? Well written? Great animation? No, none of the above, unless you count the standard for Batman animation.I always try to grade movies based on their genre. Sure, a 10 star horror is not as good as a 10 star historical drama, but if I were to delve any deeper, say: rate a movie based on other transvestite vampire dramedies I've seen, I would get nowhere. That is why I refuse to compare this with other Batman animated films and instead judge it as a movie. And it is plain silly.It has several major flaws: it reinvents Batman (no more origin stories, puh-lease!), it does the \"Batman didn't want to be Batman if he had a chance to be happy\" and it brings in the Joker, again, for no good reason. But the worse thing: again with the idea that anyone can just put on a cap and uniform and become a superhero or supervillain.You know who does that and everybody makes fun of them? Policemen. And they are many and are well equipped. You know what really makes Batman a hero? Money. And every Batman movie just drives that point again and again: Batman is good, so it's OK to use company money for his little side game, but coming from the gutter and gaining that same power through violence and tough choices is bad.My conclusion: not even the best animated Batman I've seen. I could feel no empathy towards any of the characters, which is bad, since the plot required me to. The animation was almost bad, as well.

I remember staying up all night in the summer of 2001 for no reason, I was bored so I decided to go to the living room and find a movie to watch. I remember seeing the tape on the front of the living room set, so I pick it up and watch it and it was breathtaking in every direction, and finally gave \"Batman\" fans something to care about.This is the first film from the \"Batman: The Animated Series\" in which the film's plot involves Batman being framed for killing a group of gangsters; but here's the catch, the new villain is identical to Batman in terms of the cape.The villain is known as the Phantasm in which he makes his appearance in a gray cloak, a blade for a hand, and a silver mask (almost identical to Doctor Doom) in which his weapon is not only hand-to-hand combat, but also uses smoke as a weapon as well for distraction, and that's what he uses to kill off the first two victims in the story; by leading one to crash his car on the street from a garage to crushing a mobster with a headstone at a graveyard (this might not be suitable for young viewers); and yet, both the gangsters and the cops work together to kill Batman and the only person who believes that the caped crusader isn't a murderer is Commissioner Gordon. Even the District Attorney Arthur Reeves, wants him dead and yet he's working with the same gangsters that are involved with the Phantasm.Throughout the film we encounter a beautiful woman name Andrea Beaumont who makes a fool out of Bruce Wayne, and in a flashback of Bruce Wayne, its explained that the woman was the first love of Bruce Wayne, but it tears him apart when Andrea abandons Bruce by leaving with her father to France after in tides with a local mafia. The flashback also shows how Bruce Wayne started out as the caped crusader by going through different fights with criminals disturbing the peace. He uses smoke bombs and jacks to stop the bad guys and vehicles along with different techniques of combat. He discovers later in his mansion that he has a cave and in one scene of the film he's at the funeral of his dead parents and tells him that he doesn't want to fight crime; I felt Bruce's pain in this movie, unlike the other films because all he wanted to do was lead a normal life.With people believing Batman killing the mobsters, there is one gangster who is scared to death, Sal Velestore, who pays a visit at the old Gotham Exhibit, which the Joker lives there. Sal pays him two million dollars to get rid of Batman. The Joker makes Sal laugh to death while getting the Phantasm on tape, and now The Joker knows the true identity of the vigilante.During the film, Batman discovers that the gangsters who died are related to the same mafia that Andrea's father was working with and discovers that The Joker used to work for the organization. Realizing that Andrea comes back into town, he realizes that he will do everything to protect his love and try to reveal who the killer is before it's too late.Batman: Mask of the Phantasm proves to be one of the greatest animated films ever and the best Batman ever made.",

Kevin Conroy has always provided Batman with a perfect voice. There is a particular weight to his performance here that I believe makes it one of his best performance as Batman. Some examples of this are; when he's being chased by the SWAT team and removes his cape and cowl to serve as a decoy COMPROMISING HIS IDENTITY (gasp), when he pleads before his parents' grave, and when Andrea returns the ring.I can't think of anything I didn't like about this movie, which these days for me is a rarity. I'd recommend this movie to everyone, but more specifically animation students.",

There was also no real end to the mob boss storyline, it was just kind of all left again on the joker, and that was what was annoying about this film.Batman and Bruce Wayne were played fairly well and it was pretty enjoyable to see this character in this situation, but most of the answers were given to him rather than him having to use any real skills to uncover the mystery and at the end he just kind of guessed who the phantasm was in my eyes, and it was pretty obvious as the only new person in town.All in all I enjoyed the film, but to some reviews I've seen say ti s the only batman that could rival the dark knight I simply don't understand, it was good as just a bit of extra context and worth a watch but not as good as made out.",

We have seen better stories of Batman than this overvalued piece. Despite being good on paper, the pace hardly picks up until the third act. The revelation of Phantasm, in the end, is not as shocking as it should be due to its tactless handling of the narrative. The predictability of the story is another off-putting thing about it.The portrayal of the Batman is gawky. He has been transformed into a desperate romantic guy from being the world's greatest detective, and that really feels offensive. While some people argue that it portrays the more human side of Batman. OK, well then how about making a romantic movie with James Bond and a family movie with Deadpool. Come on man! seriously... These guys are what they are cuz we love them doing what they do best. Not everyone can digest Indiana Jones into a family drama just because it shows his human side. Similarly, Batman is all about what he does. He is the greatest detective and tactician of the world. And he adores what he does, so do we. If not then what's the difference between Batman and other vigilantes? While It is an interesting character study, it surely isn't the best portrayal of Batman on screen.Voice cast is good. Mark Hamill is good as Joker. Andrea's character was ruined by a defective scripting. The character needed some more time to breath and hence feels one-dimensional.All in all, a strictly average affair...5 out of 10",

We still have our troubled soul Bruce Wayne trying to fight off his demons in a very tragic way which makes one sympathise with him and it has more of a focus on Bruce Wayne rather than Batman which gives the viewer a much more depressing and grim depiction of him. I would urge people to check this out when ever they get a chance but treat this as a small appetiser for The Dark Knight as it kind of acts on an expansion to Batman Begins, my only complaint was that this one was too short !

            "content": "I must say this is an intriguing film starring the Dark Knight. As the animated series at the time began draw in audiences, young and old, with its serious stories, fun music, great action scenes, and well-executed character explorations, Warner Bros. decided to cash in on its current success and produce a feature-length animated film to bring us a new perspective in the life of Bruce Wayne. Pretty much the first and only animated film released in theaters, this is Batman: Mask of the Phantasm.Plot: Believe it or not, there was a time when before donning the famous cowl, Bruce Wayne, billionaire orphaned son of Thomas and Martha Wayne, almost chose a normal life with his great love Andrea Beaumont. However, circumstances forced him other wise. Now, years later, a mysterious figure haunts the streets of Gotham City known simply as the Phantasm. As the vigilante begins to deliver a lethal brand of justice to several interconnected crime bosses, the Phantasm's remarkable similarity to the Batman have caused the police to suspect Bruce for these crimes. With the police hot on his trail and the past coming back to haunt him, can Batman put an end to the madness? Who is the Phantasm? And how does the Joker fit into all of this? Tune in same Bat time, same Bat channel! I've heard about this movie for years, but never got around to seeing it until now. Now that I've seen it, I must say that this is a very well-made super hero movie. The dilemmas Batman goes through and the deeper exploration of his past with Andrea are quite interesting. The violence and the dialog are actually more adult oriented than usual and that's saying a lot for a TV series kids watch. The action scenes are actually great, the stakes are raised and things just get crazier with every minute. The music is also great, extremely compelling and complementing the mood of many scenes extremely well.Kevin Conroy remains to be the best Batman ever and I applaud his continuous work in providing the voice of one of the greatest super heroes of all time. Mark Hamill as Joker is still a wonderful thing to see, his performance being fun to watch while also being rather creepy. I also love how the Clown Prince of Crime plays into the complex plot of the film. Andrea is one of the most interesting love interests I have seen in the franchise, having her own unique set of personal qualities and flaws. Finally, the Phantasm has an excellent look and spine-chilling voice that make the masked vigilante a worthy, and scary, villain.In conclusion, this is definitely one of the best batman movies I've seen and yet I feel that it seems a little underrated and that it deserves greater recognition. Mask of the Phantasm is an excellent film involving character study and epic adult dilemmas. Interesingly, the Phantasm would later make a surprise appearance in an episode of the ever-awesome series \"Justice League Unlimited.\" Batman fans will love this flick and so will newcomers, so it's definitely recommended that you check this action out. Enjoy!",

Mask of the Phantasm is a brilliant Batman film and comes close second to The Dark Knight in my opinion as one of the best ever made.\nThe story do this one is simple but effective being about a killer called The Phantasm who is framing Batman for the murders a simple story for a villain but very effective.\nThe story also focuses alot on Batman's past and how he started being Batman something that animated hadn't really done yet adding more to the world building that the animated series already made.The villain in this movie is amazing such a dark and mysterious villain and the twist when the audience finds out who really is underneath the mask is both shocking and effective to the story and to Bruce Wayne's past. The story all flows so well together and adds something to character of Batman that not many people have seen before.The voice acting in this movie is amazing with Mark Hamill as the Joker still my personal favourite such an iconic laugh and voice to an amazing character and how Joker fits into the story is amazing seeing how caused the Phantasm to start in the first place and how he relates to the twist is awesome.\nKevin Conroy voices Batman wants again and still is iconic has always he brings a lovely performance to the character in this one and you can tell this is story he wanted to for Batman for a while.The animation is very similar to the animated series but i always say if it isn't broke don't fix it because the animation in both this movie and the animated series is amazing.My favourite scene in this one is the scene at the grave where Bruce is asking his dead parents can stop with the Batman crusade and the promise he made because hes met someone and its different now hes happy such an emotional scene for Bruce and the fact that he asks his parents can he stop just breaks me everytime and is wonderfully acted by Kevin Conroy.Verdict 9/10 brilliant Batman film well acted and well animated one of the best in my opinion its a shame most of the films cant be this well told",

It may be a cartoon but sometimes a great story is strong enough however it is delivered and this is a great example of this. It makes all the live action films look painfully silly, particularly the later ones and is truly worth hunting down.This is what and who Batman should be. Someone who is driven by vengeance, who cannot reconcile love and his obligations to protect, someone who uses physical violence and intelligence, not a plethora of gadgets that he just carries around to bail him out of that one in a million tight spot, to fight crime and restore order.The animation is good, it's the only cartoon drawn on black paper to aid in its dark feel, the music score is powerful, dark and brooding, the voice acting is top notch with Batman and Andrea played wonderfully by Kevin Conroy and Dana Delaney although the film is stolen by the Joker who is played by Mark Hamill from star wars fame. He brings something magical to the role, perfectly nailing the mix of being cool, funny, evil and sinister. Like the film, this is the perfect embodiment of who the Joker should be. The story is excellent keeping up with the mystery surrounding the phantasm and also telling Bruce Wayne's back-story, how he discovered the bat cave, bat car and what drove on his hunger for revenge.The ending with him standing dejected having lost his love and his foe and the world seemingly in flames is pure poetry. Batman is a character that should have everything but still not be able to obtain the small things that we normal folk hold dear. Someone that carries on his fight alone and doesn't 'get the girl' every time. We as the audience want to feel a connection to him and I feel I understood more of what was going on in this character then any of the live action versions.",

Otherwise, it's business as usual, with Batman on the trail of a vigilante whose brutal murders are being blamed on him.

However, he quickly lost interest in the storyline told in this 1993 addition to the story of the Caped Crusader. And I must admit that my interest was also becoming fast tested to its limits. Why? Well, because the storyline was essentially pointless and lacked the ability to captivate me.Sure \"Batman: Mask of the Phantasm\" had Mark Hamill on the cast list doing voice acting for The Joker, but not even this was sufficient to salvage this movie and make it even somewhat worthwhile for me.What I had the biggest issue with was the art style, because I am not fan of that particular drawing style. Needless to say that I wasn't much of a fan of the animated series either.I did find the Phantasm character to be somewhat interesting and added a good element to the story. And it is, of course, always a blast to have The Joker in a movie.I was told that I should watch \"Batman: Mask of the Phantasm\" as it supposedly was one of the better animated Batman movies.

            "content": "Mask of the Phantasm tells a story that is among the most daring and bold ever told within the Batman canon. Its tragedy is heartfelt, depicting Bruce Wayne as if he is trapped in a cell, jailed by an oath made in passion and sorrow immediately following his parent's death. He wonders if he deserves to be happy, if he has earned the right to live a normal life, and indulge in the pleasures Batman has continually been stripped of. Heroism is deconstructed here, no longer a sanctuary of virtue, but rather an asylum of deprivation. The villains he has amassed in his turn as the Batman have torn his life apart, beautifully conveyed in the fact that through a simple murder, the Joker once again deprived Bruce Wayne of the life he should have had.Mask of the Phantasm is constructed perfectly, boasting incredible Germanic artistic influences, a resounding and operatic score, a remarkably concise script and a masterful manipulation of tone and linear shifts. The Citizen Kane-esque storytelling structure is ingenious, visually articulating the life Wayne may have had if he had never embraced the Batman identity. The mask of the phantasm is a facade that defines Bruce Wayne, a representation of the consistently conflicting notions of morality and heroism. If he falls into the abyss, he becomes just like the villains he has fought for so long. If he rises above, he can only look on as the life he deserves passes him by and that is the real tragedy of the Batman character.Mask of the Phantasm is a masterpiece of animation, and of film in general. It defies the expectations of what an animated superhero film should be and stands as one of the greatest examples of what nuanced and passionate filmmaking and animation in particular can accomplish. It's one of the greatest pieces of art in the gargantuan Batman mythology, and among the multitudes of cinematic explorations of the Batman character out there, this one may just stand out as the diamond of the bunch.",

I also loved the darker tone and the violence. The voice acting was stellar. Those are the greatest aspects of this movie and, they keep it from hitting rock bottom. One of my main issues with the movie is it feels like a single stretched out episode of the TV show. It feels like 22 minutes laced with flashbacks to give context to the seen your watching. In this way Mask of the Phantasm feels longer than it is. The problem with this movie feeling to long is that it's only 76 minutes long. This is a major stilted pacing issue of Mask of the Phantasm. As for the final twist at the end of the movie it was nothing but predictable. Giving the Joker a locked down backstory in this canon is something I view rather neutrally. As I view most of the movie. The movie is at best very slightly above average if only for the dark tone. That's about the most I can say without spoiling the movie but, if you have a brain and, can remember things for a period of longer than 24 hours than you'll be able to be 40 minute ahead of this movie at all times.",

Certainly the series and this film, in terms of visual artistry, is leaps and bounds ahead of any previous superhero fare on TV. You'd have to go back to the Max Fleischer \"Superman\" short subjects of the 1940s, which helped to inspire the background and character designs here, to find any comparison. The plot, characterizations and dialogue are also far superior, but that's not saying much. This film, though, holds its own next to the average action movie. In fact, being an animated cartoon helps us to accept clich\u00e9s and conventions that might be more irritating in a live-action film.My biggest complaint is with the animation itself. The character designs are excellent, but the \"acting\" of the characters is fairly poor and prevents us from becoming more involved in their emotional lives than we otherwise might.

Considering how amazing Mark Hammill's Joker voice is, it's almost too bad he didn't get the role in the original live-action film.And of course the artwork is a higher-budget version of the cartoon show: 1920s futurist German artwork combined with 1940s American noir and even science fiction. Lots of black, gray, and red.I think animation is the best medium for a story like Batman to work within. It's too bad no one has the guts to make a more adult-themed Batman movie along these lines.

Here we get a genuine love interest for Bruce in the form of the wonderful Andrea Beaumont. Full of agency and sass, she is a perfect Femme Fatale counterpoint to Batman. It's compelling to see Bruce wrestle between his love for her and his desire to fulfil the promise he made to his dead parents. The scene at their grave is phenomenal, packed with emotion, and is probably the most realised portrait of Bruce Wayne's damaged psyche ever committed to screen.Mark Hamill is as always on point as Joker and it's great to see him involved in a darker, more twisted storyline. There are some lovely little nods to other films, like the mobster with the oxygen tank channelling Dennis Hopper from Blue Velvet and the deliciously grand and gothic musical score perfectly accompanies the superb animation.It absolutely amazes me every time I watch this film that it was made primarily for children. It's smart, sophisticated, and packed with intense adult themes, yet still manages to be an exciting and definitive take on the Batman origin story that fans of any age can digest. Wonderful!",

            "content": "This Post May Contain Spoilers : One of the best Batman movies was in animation. Right next to the live action Batman Begins, this is superb animation and a great storyline and unlike the series itself, we got a musical score soundtrack of this movie. Unlike the Fox episodes, we see Batman actually punch bad guys in this movie and we see his fist connect. The closest WB came to exploring Batman's origin is in this movie. Or we at least see Bruce Wayne in his early 20's, barely out of college, and right before he became Batman and how his first true love, Andrea Beaumont nearly steered him away from his destiny. Kevin Conroy, Mark Hammill, and the cast did a superb job with the voice overs and I love the voice of Dana Delaney. She is already beautiful and I love the sound of her voice as Andrea. I was shocked in 1996 when she would voice over Lois Lane in Superman: The Animated Series. I was also surprised to discover that Abe Vigoda, (Fish from Barney Miller) was the voice of the old mob boss,Sal Valestra. We also see the Joker before he was the Joker. Taking my cue from the Tim Burton Movie, we get to see the Joker when he was Jack Napier, only briefly. My favorite Joker line is \"Not bad lady, you're harder to kill than a cockroach on steroids.\" I also enjoyed seeing more of Batman in an unmasked state several times in the movie. I saw it in the comics all the time and was glad they did it with this movie. If you've never seen Mask of the Phantasm, I highly recommend it for purchase or rental. You will see a great animated action story as well as a great love story. I look at Mask of the Phantasm as complimentary of the first 70 episodes of Batman: The Animated Series.",

            "content": "Before Christopher Nolan came along and redefined Batman for a new generation, it was Batman: The Animated Series which was the definitive adaptation of the Batman mythos. With its timeless anachronistic 40's feel, its well-scripted plots (many of them inspired from the Batman comics of the 70's and 80's) and its well-maintained balance between the heroic optimism and darkness of this protagonist, Batman TAS was essentially a pioneer in the field of more mature action oriented cartoons. And Mask of the Phantasm captures the best of what made this series tick.The main storyline is pretty interesting, though nothing particularly remarkable. Batman is framed for the murders of a series of mob-bosses, which were actually carried out by the titular Phantasm (not named as such in the film itself). However, the real charm of this film is in the flashback scenes which delve into Bruce's past and how he eventually ended up donning the cape and cowl. This film was the only on-screen adaptation of the mythos (until Batman Begins) to depict Bruce's transformation into the Batman, which is one of the most powerful scenes in the TAS ever. His doomed relationship with Andrea Beaumont and the role it plays in his metamorphosis into the costumed vigilante further adds depth to the character, in ways we have never seen before, as we realise exactly what Bruce had to sacrifice to live the life he has chosen. And as the story moves forward, the past and present of the Dark Knight begin to merge... Watch out especially for the subtle hints towards the Joker's background and a nice brief flashback scene which foreshadows their legendary enmity!",

Bruce Timm (Executive producer, writer and director of the Batman Animated Series) has made the Dark Knight the way he was meant to be in on film but only in animated form as he crafted Bob Kane's famous comic creation into a very special animated movie.

All the performances are top notch, Mark Hamill is wild and crazy as The Joker and he really goes to town and has a lot of fun like Nicholson in the first movie, and Kevin Conroy is absolutely stunning as Bruce and Batman, his voice is so intimidating and kinda scary.

Nevertheless, Tim Burton's Batman/Batman Returns redefined the character on film, and Michael Keaton proved to be a great Batman -- and Bruce Wayne in particular -- so bringing out an animated feature better than those movies was impressive.Like the animated series that it spawned from and those that would succeed it, Mask of the Phantasm was digestible for all ages and gave a dark, yet profound, exploration of the character of Bruce Wayne/Batman. It was masterfully written, mature, and dark--but not overbearingly so.While this is a comic book-based world where superheroes are viable, given the character has the necessary assets and motivation, it's great when this medium/genre gets meta by subtly (and not subtly) opening a discourse for whether what the superhero does is right. Batman is a fantastic character to introduce this thought. As Andrea implies to Bruce when he tells her vengeance won't bring any solace, he isn't one to talk.Despite famously declaring he is vengeance, Bruce has to rethink whether crusading on this concept will accomplish anything long term. Batman has a massive mental/emotional toll on Bruce that is shown with him pleading at his parents' graves to relieve him of the responsibility of his mission, something they never forced him into.",

He is one of the most iconic comic book characters of all time and has thrived in almost every media source the series has adapted to. Of these extensions the most famous is the film adaptations. Tim Burton's Batman pushed the limits of what is considered to be children's entertainment and intense adult action and drama. Christopher Nolan reboot series has been equally influential, showing that a comic book film can take place in a realistic environment. However, one Batman series which is often overlooked in the character plunge into the animated world. Batman: The Animated Series is considered to be one of the best cartoons shows of all time and Batman: Mask of the Phantasm does for film what the cartoon show did for television, Batman: Mask of the Phantasm is able to fit two well developed stories into only 76 minutes. The first and primary plot focuses on Batman tracking down The Phantasm, a mysterious vigilante who has been systematically killing off mobsters while Batman is blamed. The second story focuses on the young fledgling crime fighter Bruce Wayne and how close he came to quitting in order to have a normal life with his love interest, Andrea Belmont.The movie begins with Batman breaking into a mob runs counterfeiting scheme, Batman deals with the henchman while the boss, Chuckie Sol, makes a beak for it. Before Batman can catch him he is murdered by the Phantasm. Batman is blamed for the killing and is forced to track down his imitator. Things grow more complicated as Andrea interest returns to Gotham City and Bruce believes that her father is somehow connected to the murders. This triggers Bruce's reminiscing about how his life would have been if he stayed with her. The film does a great job in juggling these to plots without ever being terribly predictable.The voice acting is equally admirable. Kevin Conroy's portrayal as Batman/Bruce Wayne is one of the most overlooked performances ever. He gives both Batman and Bruce Wayne different voices and speech patterns. He even makes the younger Bruce Wayne speak more energetically and innocently. The same can be said for Dana Delany who plays the young Andrea Belmont as na\u00efve and playful while the older version is more dark and isolated. The one performance that stands out, however, is The Joker, voiced by Mark Hamill. The Joker one has a few scenes but steals every shot that he is in, perfectly balancing the clown and the killer.However, as good as the story and acting is, it is the drawing style and animation the really stand out from the rest of the animated features. Unlike other animated films, Mask of the Phantasm focuses on a dark art deco design to show the vastness of Gotham City and to show the range of character emotions.The only negatives about the movie would be that the stories are very tight, which causes some scenes to feel rushed and less significant than it should, such as when Bruce first suits up as Batman. That and a few corny lines and clich\u00e9 morals really stick out from the high quality of the rest of the film. Still, Batman: Mask of the Phantasm is a terrific piece of entertainment that should not be skip by anyone that is a fan of Batman, animation, or film in general.",

It also explored some new narrative ground, introduced a cool new villain named Phantasm, explored Bruce's psychological issues, and had a great romantic subplot as well. The voice acting was on par, featuring both Kevin Conroy and Mark Hamill at their finest voicing The Caped Crusader and The Clown Prince of Crime. The characters were believable. Bruce Wayne dealt with some very human issues and felt very human (unlike Val Kilmer's portrayal of him in the Batman movie that came next), Andrea felt very human too. And I like how the movie examined and developed their relationship throughout the film. And Phantasm was scary, Joker was psychotic, Arthur was charming- the characters acted like they were supposed too.The action sequences were decent through electrifying, with plenty of exciting fights and chase sequences scattered throughout. The movie also paints a dark, somber, gritty, and mature depiction of Gotham that the popular 60's live-action TV series never showed. The movie's visuals, exciting final sequence, and moral are also very good too. And you would probably be surprised but I found nothing bad at all with this movie. Final Consensus: Batman: Mask of the Phantasm is probably the best animated Batman movie of all times featuring an interesting and mature story, good voice acting, good character development, electrifying action sequences, a gritty tone, decent visuals, great final sequence, and a good moral. It is nearly flawless, in my opinion. Due to frequent moderate violence and consistent moderately frightening scenes, this movie is recommended for kids 9+.",

I first saw this film only last year but have wanted to see it for years. Finding the video was no easy task, found it, DVD just came out, sold VHS. It was worth it I love the whole evolution of Batman and his extremely dark past. I first saw the dark side of Batman when I was 5 years old on Christmas night 1990, and I saw Tim Burton's Batman.

            "content": "There are really two ways to go when adapting a television show, much like with sequels: you go bigger, or you go deeper. The live action adaptation of the 60s comedy show went bigger, bringing in all of the main villains together for one large plot. This feature film continuation of the animated series from the early 90s goes deeper, much deeper, possibly gaining and retaining the crown for the film version of the Caped Crusader that gets him best. And, in addition, the film is shockingly tight, with a villain that informs our main character rather than just stands apart, intelligent use of images to help provide deeper meaning to what's going on, and a marvelous voice cast that nails the emotional reality of what's going on. Also, it's just great to look at on top.A masked vigilante has begun killing prominent mobsters, and Batman (Kevin Conroy) is being blamed. Commissioner Gordon (Bob Hastings) refuses to believe that it's Batman since Batman does not kill, but city councilman Arthur Reeves (Hart Bochner) is on the warpath, convinced of Batman's guilt. We know from the start that it's not Batman because we watch the masked figure, the Phantasm, do the deed. Who is the Phantasm, and what do they ultimately want?I remember being lukewarm on this film when I was much younger because the film barely contained the Joker. He doesn't appear until halfway through, and he doesn't become prominent until the final act of the film. In his place for most of the film are these relatively generic mobsters, ultimately led by Salvatore Valestra (Abe Vigoda). What the movie does with these less flamboyant villains is really allow the focus of the film to rest on Bruce and his exploration of his past. For the film, the team of writers (most notably including Paul Dini) created a woman from Bruce's past, Andrea Beaumont (Dana Delany). She and Bruce fell in love in the earliest days of Batman, before Bruce had settled on the bat as his engine of fear. The conflict Bruce has between needing to fulfill his vow to his parents to exact justice upon those who would prey upon the innocent of Gotham City and his desire to simply be happy with Andrea pinpoints who Bruce is when he is Batman. He cannot have ties because his life can be nothing but Batman in order to do what he has to do. The idea of marrying Andrea almost convinces Bruce to abandon the project, that for which he begs forgiveness from his parents at their grave. When she and her father mysteriously disappear after Bruce proposes to her, he had nothing left and took up the mantle of the bat.This backstory is told in flashback interspersed amidst the present day investigation of the Phantasm and the deaths of the mobsters. Salvatore ultimately runs to the dilapidated World's Fair of Gotham where the Joker (Mark Hamill) is hiding out to look for safety since, in another life, the Joker was one of Salvatore's henchmen.Now, when I say this movie uses images really well, I'm mostly thinking of the World's Fair. There's a scene in the flashback where Bruce and Andrea go to the World's Fair, seeing it in all its glory, and it's at the same time that Bruce is seeing his future with Andrea as a happy, hopeful thing. The World's Fair's vision of a technologically advanced future feeds that. When Salvatore goes there to hide, we see it falling apart, the promise of the future having fallen into disrepair, mirroring the destruction of Bruce's own image of his own future, but that's just the start of it. The film's finale takes place there, and the ultimate fight pits Bruce against the image of Andrea he had held onto for years, ultimately ending with the whole place exploding in huge balls of flame at the same time that Bruce realizes the future he had imagined, and gotten a taste of once more, was never going to come back.The actual mystery extends into Andrea coming back to Gotham after the deaths have begun, and her immediately figuring out that Bruce is Batman (because she's no dummy). The deaths of the mobsters are intimately tied to her past and, in particular, the day that she left Bruce. How all of this comes together (in a super-tight 78-minute film no less) is rather amazing.The art-deco inspired visual design of the film (and show, of course) has always provided it a certain timeless appeal. Much like Burton's Batman, the combination of film noir-like character design and costumes mixed with the high-tech computers allows the movie to exist outside of a specific time, giving it the ability to age rather gracefully. Thirty years after the film's release, it doesn't feel like a product of the early 90s, it feels like it could have been made at any time. The score, built off of Danny Elfman's original work and expanded wonderfully by Shirley Walker, helps enhance the depth of feeling, tragedy, and sadness of the film as well.I love this film. It really is one of the best depictions of Batman on screen, and I'm really glad I finally revisited it.",

Bruce Tim and company know and respect the source material enough play it as it should be: in epic terms. This is established from the get go with the operatic intro and the story telling takes it from there. Batman comes off like one the Greek heroes of old; struggling with the tragedy fate imposes upon him, his triumphs tempered by loss he presses on in his grim cause.Coming treacherously very close to becoming the very evil he has dedicated himself to end. Which is why the Phantasm makes for such an effective and personal villain for Batman because the Phantasm represents that very fine line, that if crossed Batman would be forever lost. All this is presented fluid animation, with some truly excellent voice acting, and an amazing score only the rather exposition laden plot detracts from the overall experience. A fine example of how the animated medium should be used: as a way tell a good story, not specifically pander to a youthful audience as it so often has been in recent years.",

            "content": "Batman Mask of the Phantasm was intended to be a straight to video release, but Warner Bros. thought it had box office potential and gave it a theatrical release. I would imagine the writers must have panicked when they got the memo, but they certainly delivered. The movie failed at the box office but it has done very well on home video, and rightly so. With the writing staff and cast of the excellent Animated Series, Batman: Mask of the Phantasm became the first Batman movie where Batman was not overshadowed by the villains since the Adam West era. The Phantasm is a vigilante who systematically kills all of Gotham City's mob bosses. Witnesses mistake the Phantasm for Batman, and Batman finds himself pursued by the police, despite Commissioner Gordon's support. Batman hunts down the Phantasm to clear his name, but soon his arch-nemesis, the Joker, is hired to take out the Phantasm first! In the meantime, Bruce Wayne's ex-flame Andrea Beaumont is back in town, and this news leads to some flashbacks into Wayne's past. When they are reunited Wayne must choose between Andrea and Batman (which certainly happens a lot in superhero movies). We learn that the Phantasm has a very personal motive for killing these mob bosses, as well as a connection to the Joker, which keeps Wayne devoted to his duty for at least a little while longer. Mask of the Phantasm was really the first Batman origin story on the big screen, and in many ways it tells the story better than Begins. The flashbacks are interwoven throughout the movie but they don't feel like they are slowing the movie to a halt. We learn how Bruce Wayne began his crime fighting career and designed his costume. Alfred's reaction to the costume was perfect: \"My God...\" The cast is perfect. Kevin Conroy is still the best actor to play Batman (IMO), and Mark Hamill (!) of Star Wars fame makes a surprisingly good Joker. I was shocked when I learned Hamill was the Joker. My parents didn't even believe me when I told them, they thought it must be another actor with the same name! He is a dark villain yet just right for kids and adults to enjoy. This movie proves that a Batman movie can be made where Batman and the villains really balance each other out. Batman, The Phantasm, and The Joker all have compelling stories. The dialog is a lot better than the usual superhero cartoon, and the 1940's art deco design of Gotham City is my favorite. The love story actually does not feel like a distraction, which is a refreshing change. If I had one criticism it would be that the Phantasm is a little similar to Catwoman in Batman Returns. Find this movie on DVD. It is one of those really good movies that you can find really cheap, but I hope they come out with more special features in the future.",

            "content": "Long before cinematic universes were a thing started by Marvel and DC was trying to catch up on that, the comic book brand had already initiated such a phenomenon with their animated universe back in the early 1990s. It all began with Batman: The Animated Series. Adopting various parts of Tim Burton's live action films and taking inspiration from other Batman works, the animated series proved itself to be quite eventful for many fans of the property and newcomers alike. It was even more surprising to many when Warner Bros. Decided to not only produce but also theatrically release an animated movie based on the TV show. And unlike much of Warner Bros. Live action films, this one got some fairly decent praise. And it seemed like that trend followed through with many of the other future animated films.The story is about a mysterious cloaked vigilante going around doing in very well-known mobsters in Gotham. Being mistaken for Batman by city official Arthur Reeves, Bruce Wayne begins investigating who is behind the mask. Simultaneously, an old friend and ex-lover by the name of Andrea Beaumont returns throwing Wayne off balance due to their complicated history. Written by Alan Burnett, Paul Dini, Martin Pasko and Michael Reaves, the story is very much a fun ride to experience with some expected flaws. The structure shows Wayne's dive into becoming what he is best known for now. Adding to that are the things he wants versus what he knows he must do. All the writers mentioned have had experience working on various other shows prior to this. The same goes for directors Bruce Timm and Eric Radomski.The progression at which Bruce Wayne transforms into someone not sure of his path, to confirming for himself what he must be, is an interesting one to watch. All viewers love Batman, but to be Batman means sacrifice and that's never easy to watch let alone actually go through like the main character. With that there comes some intriguing revelations as more of the mystery is uncovered. This historical background adds some extra depth to some of the main characters' relationships. However, with that comes new questions to be asked that may not ever be answered. These kinds of issues though are far and few between though. The voice cast behind the characters is of course top notch and should not be underestimated. And to those who are starting with this instead of the TV show, some may also be quite shocked.Although best known as Batman now, Kevin Conroy began a career in live action roles in TV shows. However now, one cannot deny how much Conroy is practically Batman as much as vice versa. The same could be said for Dana Delany playing Andrea Beaumont. Her career trajectory was very similar in path. Hart Bochner playing Arthur Reeves is fine. Coincidentally he also played the love interest in DC's live action Supergirl (1984). Stacy Keach who voices Andrea's father Carl Beaumont and the masked mystery man does well too. There's also voice appearances from Abe Vigoda, Dick Miller, John P. Ryan, Efrem Zimbalist Jr., Bob Hastings, Robert Costanzo and lastly Mark Hamill who some still can't believe voiced the Joker. And if you don't know who Mark Hamill is,...please come back after watching Star Wars.From a visual perspective, the movie looks good. The animation very much throughout the run time is crisp and has plenty of dimension to it. Even for what many would consider a cartoon, the violence and action is also more intense than the cartoon itself. There was also cinematography by Sung-Il Choi in his only credit for this role. Perhaps this was only for the opening CGI intro where the camera pans over the city. Finally, the music composed by Shirley Walker is only a mere extension of her work from the TV show. The themes resurrected from Tim Burton's films remain along with new themes to listen to. Additionally, the extended album comes with a rare song sung by Tia Carrera. Overall it's an album hardly any Batman fan would ignore. It's definitely not the hardest to find either.Looking further into the details on the story raises some new questions on the historical background of certain characters. Cinematography credit isn't the clearest either but that's nothing compared to the entertainment provided from the charismatic voice acting, thought provoking story, expressive animation and music.",

            "content": "It seems strange that in the 1990s, Batman on television went right where the features films went so wrong. In four films, neither Tim Burton nor Joel Schumacher ever managed to come close the core of what Batman was supposed to be about. Of the two, Burton came the closest, but his films were marred by gloomy self-indulgence and a Caped Crusader that was hard to care anything about. Schumacher, meanwhile, just made feature-length toy commercials.It all comes down to writing. The features were about action and violence while TV's \"Batman: The Animated Series\" got down to the serious business of exploring what made the characters tick. The writing team of the show figured out the basic truth about The Caped Crusader, that Batman and his adversaries have never been simply pawns to move around a plot. There is always a method to their madness, some dark and haunted demons that make them do what they do. That applies, most aptly, to Batman himself whose persona is a personal prison. He's haunted by what happened as a child and burns with the urge to avenge the parents that were taken from him. The Animated Series consistently explored this haunted soul in a way that the features never did.\"Batman: Mask of the Phantasm\" is the large-screen version of their vision. Released on Christmas Day in 1993, it arrived with little notice and was a box office disaster, mostly due to poor advertising. It was released to glowing critical acclaim and only found an audience when it was released on video. It remains a cult classic, a hidden treasure waiting to be discovered. For all the fuss and bother with the other features, this one gets Batman absolutely right.\"Batman: Mask of the Phantasm\" actually tells two intricately written stories. The main story has Batman (voiced by Kevin Conroy) being framed for murder by a cloaked figure called The Phantasm who is killing off Gotham City's crime bosses. The other story involves Bruce Wayne's rekindling with an old love, Andrea Beaumont (voiced by Dana Delaney), whom he almost married before becoming Batman. The film periodically flashes back to show Bruce, during his college years, standing at a crossroads in his life. He is haunted by the murder of his mother and father and his soul burns to avenge their deaths. Yet, he also sees a light for his path, a method by which he can escape from his demons and into a life of marriage and children. They are conflicted. Andrea, too, has lost a parent and she is just has heartbroken as Bruce. It is a tragic love story, but it is made all the more palatable by the fact that Bruce and Andrea are presented as flesh and blood people who care deeply about one another.Written smartly by series writers Alan Burnett, Paul Dini, Martin Pasko and Michael Reaves, the story is molded very much by the character's personalities. The action scenes have more resonance because we've come to care about those involved. The animation here is crisp and beautifully drawn in an art-deco style reminiscent of Max Fleisher's Superman cartoon. The images are simplistic but not simple-minded. The colors, the shading, the light and shadow that reflect the inner turmoil of both Bruce Wayne and Batman give the character a special resonance. It's easy to get absorbed in these images just as much with scenes of Batman beating up criminals as it does a heartbreaking scene of Bruce agonizing over his decision to put on the cape and cowl for the first time. The city of Gotham is presented with more clarity and depth than it is in the live action films. Through the light and dark imagery, it becomes a real place.It is strange that such an intricately woven story would take place in an animated movie. In most cases, the love and devotion goes into creating beautiful images than into creating a story that we can care about. \"Batman: Mask of the Phantasm\" is both, made by people who care about what they are putting on screen. They understand the demons that haunt Bruce Wayne and the machinations that place him in his personal prison. This is a film not to be missed.***1/2 (of four)",

The success of this children's TV show was later made into a film in 1993 called Batman Mask of the Phantasm. A new supervillian is killing gangsters in Gotham city and everyone is thinking it is Batman. Meanwhile Batman's old love interest is back in town. A lot of the movie is told in flashbacks of Batman's affair with his love interest as well as in the flashbacks it is giving the question if batman should lead a normal life or if he should don the mask of the batman. The movie is kinda of like the animated version of batman begins, but I think it's better than Batman Begins. It has some good action scenes, possibly the best storyline of any batman movie and a great voice cast. Most of the actors returned as their roles from the show. One of which is Star wars's Mark Hamil who voiced the joker in the show as well. If you're a superhero fan (espically a batman fan) then try and find it on DVD and give it a watch.",

            "review_title": "The True Definition of a Batman Movie",
            "content": "Batman has gone through so many alterations throughout his long runtime, from comics, to movies, to tv shows, and even video games. With that said, one of the most well known additions to the beloved dark knight's franchise is definitely the animated series from the 1990s by Bruce Timm and Eric Radomski. The popularity and acclaim for this series was so big that it led to a feature film adaptation entitled Mask of the Phantasm. Originally intended as a straight-to-video release, the film got put in theaters at the last minute on Christmas 1993, and unfortunately flopped financially. However, it very soon garnished a massive cult following, and to this day is considered one of if not the greatest Batman film ever made, and I couldn't agree more.The film follows Bruce Wayne (Batman) dealing with his reconciliation towards former lover, Andrea Beaumont, and a mysterious vigilante going after Gotham City's crime bosses. Right off the bat (no pun intended), what really hooks the story together is how it balances the intense murder mystery with the romance angle between Bruce Wayne and Andrea. In regards to their relationship, it actually plays a big role in how Bruce turned into the caped crusader. Given that Bruce tries to balance his need to fight for justice and his feelings towards Andrea, his entire arch comes off as appropriately gripping and even gut wrenching. It isn't until later on in the feature when it's revealed what led to Andrea as a whole, which makes the experience shockingly complex. As for the mob mystery angle, the film heightens up the tension and violence with several actions scenes that can put any viewer on the edge of their seat. It's very fascinating when the backstory of Gotham's winged defender partially has to do with emotional resonance to somebody in addition to crime.In terms of the characters, there's a good blend of familiar faces and newer ones to balance things out. As stated before, what makes Bruce Wayne quite sympathetic here is how he values both being in love and needing to avenge his lost parents, which gives him more layers than in previous incarnations. Andrea herself proves to be a perfect soul mate to Bruce, but as the film goes on, the reasons as to why they never came to be become clearer and clearer, which only tampers with her own personal feelings toward him as well. Without saying much about the titular Phantasm, that one is more of a vigilante out to murder mob bosses albeit for vengeance instead of justice. But of course, being Batman's most well known enemy, the Joker nearly steals the show with his amusingly frightening presence, as well as his significant role in Bruce and Andrea's arch that builds up more as the feature progresses. Whether it'd be the dark knight, his former flame, the major mob bosses or minor antagonists, each character plays a crucial part in every detail the film unveils.It's been said that the film had a production schedule of just eight months, yet the animation is still as if not more wonderful than it was in the series. Everything regarding the overall style of the feature feels like it came right out of a gritty graphic comic. From the dark atmospheric environments of Gotham, to the simplified albeit expressive character designs, to even the high tech gadgets and effects, each animated image pops out with raw distinction and striking vitality. While the general motion may not be as grand as other theatrical animated films at its time, the character animation still works well with solid performances and bold gestures. The amount of set pieces and camera movements also play a big role in heightening up the action and overall filmmaking magic to a massive T. Even the occasional moments of CGI look unique due to the simple shading that blends in with the already gloomy tone. When a superhero film replicates its original source material, that's when its visual identity takes a form unlike any other.It may be debatable depending on who you talk to, but I think this film stands as the best cinematic Batman venture to date. With top notch storytelling, fully realized characters, and energetic animation, Mask of the Phantasm succeeds tremendously as a testament to how powerful Batman can truly be in the realm of superhero drama. Even if you've never watched the animated series, this is still highly worth checking out as a film that puts its own clever spin on the iconic vigilante's lore. It's funny how Tim Burton and Christopher Nolan are seen as the auteurs who triumphantly brought Batman to the big screen, but as wonderful as their iterations are, they do stray away from the source material to be their own features first. Given how much Timm, Radomski, Paul Dini and everyone else involved in the film respect the real Batman material, no one can deny how much their passion bled through this extraordinary flick.",

The animation and art style doesn't feel like a cartoon, but more like a moving- better yet, living-painting. Just the poster for it feels operatic, and when Bruce Wayne becomes Batman, it truly feels so. The film really stays true to the comics, with an at times shocking and thought provoking origin story. The performances are pretty spot on, with Kevin Conroy delivering a true Batman, and Mark Hamill being show-stealing as the Joker despite his small screen time.

The film also adds a new layer to Batman and that is through his romance with Andrea and their somewhat-similar pasts. But what I find truly golden here is how the film portrays Batman less as a macho crime fighter but as an agonized victim of a haunting past and dire circumstances. The film is a great contribution to the Batman legacy as a whole and is very emotional, dark and tragic. All these make perfect for a film noir, which is what Batman is!

            "content": "BATMAN: MASK OF THE PHANTASM is a prime example of a good movie gone awry. The producers of \"Batman: The Animated Series\" wanted to bring their characters to the big screen, so they decided on a formula. They would 1. introduce a chilling new villain called The Phantasm, 2. have The Phantasm frame Batman for several murders, 3. delve into Batman's past, 4. get rid of Robin, 5. give Bruce Wayne a love interest, and 6. throw The Joker in for good measure. Sounds like a winner, doesn't it. Unfortuately, the movie comes up short on several levels. First, The Phantasm. For one thing, he's never actually called by that name in the entire movie. How is the audience supposed to know who \"Phantasm\" is? Imagine someone trying to write a summary of this movie: \"Well, it stars Batman and The Joker and some guy with a skull mask and a cleaver for a hand.\" Other gripes about The Phantasm include that he seems too supernatural (a few clues are dropped here and there that Phantasm is using some weird chemical to make himself disappear like a ghost, but the movie never plays this up)and that he has an awesome cleaver on his hand and NEVER, EVER uses it through the entire movie. Instead, he kills his victims by more subtle, impersonal methods. What kind of psychotic slasher is he? Kevin Conroy, on the other hand, is excellent as the voice of Bruce Wayne/Batman. He's determined and moody, but not a freak like Keaton's Batman. He actually has some natural human qualities that the film accentuates very well. Then you have the villains. For the most part, they're dumb, stereotypical hoods who smoke cigarettes, have exaggerated mannerisms, and are all as intelligent as a crate full of rocks. The Joker (voiced by Mark Hamill) manages to put in a stellar performance, but he certainly can't bring the devilish nuances that Jack Nicholson gave to Joker. At times, Joker talks and acts like a four-year-old with Attention Deficit Disorder, and his manic Irishman accent really gets annoying by the end of the movie. Also, he isn't as clever as we'd believe him to be and is woefully unprepared to do battle with The Phantasm. He has no henchmen, just a couple of old-fashioned robots and some buzzing helicopters that are about as frightening as a litter of newborn kittens. Characterizations aside, the film is fun to look at and watch. Danny Elfman's score is used to good effect, as is many ideas used by Burton in the live-action films (especially the paradoxical settings that blend the 1940s with our modern era). The story is also top-notch, though it is bogged down by too many flashbacks. The finale is the best part, for it includes the unmasking of The Phantasm (who isn't quite what you'd expect \"him\" to be!). Will kids like this movie? Well, it isn't a Burton film. There's no scenes of people being electrocuted, burned alive, tossed off cathedrals, or having their noses bitten off by drooling subhumans. Still, the story gets a little too preachy (not to mention monotonous) at times, and there are many extremely scary scenes. The Phantasm's costume is one of the scariest ever seen on a Batman character, and we get to see two victims of Joker's Smylex toxin (one dead, the other lying in a hospital bed howling like a hyena). I'd recommend this film only to older children, adolescents, and adults. The movie isn't destined to be a classic like the Burton films, but it's quite good on its own. Even if you are not a fan of the television show, see this movie for a whole new spin on Batman.",

The feature has Bruce Wayne's alter ego being framed for grisly murders by another vigilante... this one called the Phantasm.  The Phantasm has targeted mob bosses around Gotham, and the mob has begun searching for the killer, including Batman's nemesis, the Joker, voiced brilliantly as usual by Mark Hamill.  Tying in with matters is Bruce encountering his lost love, Andrea, which causes him to reflect back on his events of his past with her, including his transformation into the guise of Batman.  This is a very good animated feature, featuring strong animation, a great soundtrack, and an excellent voice cast.  However, two of the reasons I enjoyed this film were things that the animated movie were able to get away with, things that Batman: The Animated Series, or Fox to be specific, wouldn't allow:1.  Characters die.  There was never any death in TAS.  Although this is also a good thing in ways, when one is discussing Batman, of all things, death is usually a common issue.  No death can be good to hide from the really little kids, but can also cause a series to become extremely unrealistic and laughable(Cough, G I Joe, cough).  Here, though, many of the mob bosses are killed by the Phantasm quite gruesomely, and the animated Joker is seen using his infamous, and quite lethal, Joker Venom effectively for the very first time.  The fights are also quite violent, unlike in the animated show, we actually get to see Batman bleed, something that surprised when I first saw the film back during its theatrical release.2.  Batman doesn't always win.  I'm sorry, but when I realized Batman: The Animated Series ALWAYS had Batman come out on top and save Gotham from whatever crime boss or sadistic villain he faced, I grew out of it and stopped watching.  Here, however, he is humbled greatly.  I actually compared this to an early episode of the TV series, \"On Leather Wings,\" in which he is also framed and being chased by the police.  On the episode he avoided the cops and was able to get away from them quite easily.  Here, though, he had great difficulty trying to get away and almost wound up in police custody, even at one point being horribly wounded AND losing his mask.So this is at last the good animated version of Batman fans were looking for.  I suggest fans see this.  Don't worry, it's accessible, even if you've never seen an episode of Batman: The Animated Series before in your life. Oh, and an interesting tidbit: Dana Delany, the voice of Andrea, also went on to do the voice of Lois Lane in the animated versions of Superman and Justice League.",

Andrea Beaumont is not only a complex character in her own right (instead of a one-note love interest) but her romance with Bruce is also convincing, powerful and something the audience wants to see.While the Joker is in it, and he does indeed steal the show. Batman's and Andrea's trials and issues don't pale in comparison. He manages to fit himself into the plot and instead of forcing Batman into simply beating up the bad guy and saving the day, he helps move along the plot and wrap up everything that's going on.The plot itself is captivating. With twists and turns that while, not entirely unpredictable, manage to create a sense of mystery and intrigue for the viewer. While the movie is told partially in flashbacks, they're necessary to reveal the motivations of the various characters.The Cast sells it brilliantly. Hamill's Joker makes you fear him, and yet laugh with him at the same time. Conroy's Batman is sympathetic and interesting to watch, as with every action he drives another nail into his proverbial coffin. Delany's Beaumont is sexy, quirky, and brainy. While Zimbalist Jr.'s Alfred provides a bit of needed comedy relief and emotional support for Bruce (I admit it, his speech to him at the end of the movie almost brings me to tears every time.) Hart Bochner rounds out the cast as the slimy and sniveling Arthur Reeves.All in all, a gallivanting triumph. Showing the tragedy of Batman alongside a tragic and captivating love story. And who knew there was going to be a joker in the deck? You think by now they'd be expecting it.",

In many ways this feels like and extended episode of the Series, with no real enhancements in the audio/visual department to step it up, but since the animated series was excellent anyway, it's no big deal. The plot concerns itself with Batman being mistaken for a vigilante killer who is taking out Gotham's mob bosses one by one. The story is engaging, if a bit cliche... and the voice work and atmosphere are all very good. If you're a fan of the 90's animated series (and lets face it, who isn't) this is a must see.",

            "content": "The film maintains the \"dark deco\" direction and style of Batman: The Animated Series under the direction of Eric Radomski and Bruce W. Timm and the writing of Alan Burnett and Paul Dini (all of whom worked on TAS), and features the same voices talents as the show, including Kevin Conroy as Batman/Bruce Wayne, Efrem Zimbalist Jr as Alfred, Bob Hastings as Commissioner Gordon, Robert Constanzo as Detective Harvey Bullock, and Mark Hamill as The Joker. Basically, the movie takes all the best elements of the series, and puts it together as a longer episode. Except that if it were an episode, it never would have made it past the censors. Also, it'd be the best episode in the history of the show.As a theatrically-released movie with a 76 minute running time, Mask of the Phantasm had license to do things the Saturday afternoon cartoon show could not do. It's a darker, more mature look at Batman than the series could be, receiving a PG rating. It's no Sin City or Heavy Metal, but is more intense than usual, showing murder, blood, and allusions to sex that could never be shown on the show. Which is not to say that it's an adult film, because it's not. It's still an animated movie about a super-hero, and is still primarily for kids (albeit, older kids). It just means that Mask of the Phantasm is closer to the comic book than the series is allowed to be.In terms of story, Mask of the Phantasm is a mystery movie, as a new vigilante, who bears similarities to Batman, comes to Gotham and begins executing mob bosses. Batman must figure out who this new vigilante is to end the Phantasm's rampage, while Batman himself is being accused of the crimes. Meanwhile, a former love is back in Gotham (voiced by Dana Delany), drudging up painful memories for Bruce Wayne of the one who got away. While dealing with the Phantasm, his long-lost love, and Gotham Police, Batman also has to deal with The Joker, who is somehow involved in everything.The movie is an excellent combination of action and suspense, and until the recent release of Batman Begins, was easily the best Batman film ever (but it now must place second). Strangely, since it is a cartoon, this film has the most convincing and realistic love story in Batman movie history (although, to be fair, there's no real competition in that area, as all the other love stories in Batman movies have been rushed and unconvincing). Comic book fans will geek out over the Year One like flashbacks featuring a non-costumed young Bruce Wayne attempting to fight crime, and the appearance of the Phantasm, who, with a cape, spectre-like mask, and scythe, bears a strong resemblance to Year Two's murderous vigilante The Reaper.Personally, I absolutely loved this movie. However, it's not a movie for everyone. If you're not already a fan of Batman or Batman: The Animated Series, then I don't think this movie would have much of interest for you. But if you are a fan of the series or the character, then I highly recommend you check this film out.",

Kevin Conroy has the coolest voice on TV, and Mark Hamill gives a terrific no-holds-barred performance as the Joker.  The problem with the Batman 1-4 movie series is that they try to combine action, romance, and Batman's feelings of angst, and in the end succeed at doing none of them.  The animated movie (correctly) focuses on Batman's pain.  Because of this, it's not really a kid's movie.  Instead of choosing to animate in sort of a literal way, the show is animated in a stylized way a la Tarzan.  This is how animation should be done - if you're going to animate something it should not be because you're aiming it at kids, but rather because you can portray something in a way that's not possible with live action. The dark city and blocky animation suggest loneliness and desolation, and look at the way in which the eyes of the Joker and Batman move and squint.  I especially liked the Andrea/Batman parallel - we discover they have the same formative experience, and ultimately suffer the same ending fate.  My only gripe is that I pretty much knew who the (other) bad guy was about 1/2 way through. Still, this movie is one of my favorites.",

But as a kid I watched it, and I rewatched it when it came to Netflix in my teenage years. So I had a vague familiarity with the show. And I don't really think it is a prerequisite that you watch the show before this movie.Having said all of that, it is very much a product of that climate. The animated series was launched off the back of Tim Burton proving that the character was both popular and highly profitable. From what I remember, and the praise from fans, the show is really good and possibly better than Burton's movies. And this movie follows in line with that reputation.It does much better character work than Burton's films (and I'm not sure if the whole series does the same), and the romance is far better than anything in his two films. The response to trauma from Andrea and Bruce and how they mirror each other and the effect that it all has on Bruce is so incredibly well done. We get to explore more of why somebody would run around in a bat suit all night. We see how he could have gone down a darker path, and how his path to salvation was cut off because of Gotham.Where this film excels in its characters, it unfortunately falls flat for me with its commentary. I was once a huge fan of Batman the character and I am sure that I would have loved this at that point in my life but unfortunately I grew out of that phase. I much more appreciate what Batman means as a symbol and how it fits in the larger metaphor of Gotham City. Stories about individuals often bore me because hero worship doesn't help anything. And maybe neither does Batman.Really good story about the tragedy of Bruce Wayne.",

The central plot here is Batman's investigation into a series of murders of prominent gangsters. The cops begin to think Batman is behind them, but we discover that the mysterious Phantasm is behind. Can Batman figure out the mysterious connection between the murders before he is taken down by the policeman or another mysterious villain who appears in the final act. The thematic question of this fairly serious Batman story is whether or not Batman can move on and be happy by hanging up the cape and marrying Andrea Beaumont. Andrea Beaumont is the daughter of a missing finance man who has some connection to the gangster murders taking place. There's some nice sequences here and the story/action is enjoyable enough. This justifies a viewing from Batman fans, but doesn't quite equal the level some of the best episodes in the series achieved.",

The romantic relationship was handled with a great deal of maturity as was the action sequences (was that actually blood I saw on Batman's face as he ran from the police).  We actually get to see someone die from the Joker's venom, rictus grin and all.  The final battle between Batman/Phantasm/Joker is a real standout.  I even liked that final song at end (sung by Tia Carrere, no less).",

No other Batman movies can live up to its standard (except Batman Begins), and as of yet, I've never seen a better animated movie.The script is brilliant, the story is their own improvisation and succeeds to be excellent in every aspect. The voice acting, I thought, was overwhelming compared to other cartoons. Kevin Conroy is the perfect voice for Batman. Gruff and petrifying. Mark Hammill is also a brilliant Joker. This has been given less credit than it deserves, and it deserves a lot of credit.Of course, a Batman film would not be without a few twisted villains. The Joker is the main villain, but does not actually have any plans for criminality until he is confronted by one of his former victims. The climatic ending is overwhelming, with Batman and the Joker absolutely battering the living hell out of each other. It doesn't hesitate to show blood or violence, and to a higher extent, it gives the film one of its dark elements.Bruce Wayne's former fianc\u00e9e, Andrea has come back to Gotham City for a vengeance on all the mobsters who were involved in the killing of her father. Batman cannot allow that, it's his City. The joker is dragged into the frame when it is found he is one of the mobsters who was involved in the murder of her father. The story contains no flaws. None, whatsoever.The film possesses everything you'd hope for. A kick-ass Batman, violence, dark elements, a sense of romance, action, a good cast and a license of its own to be creative in its own story. The worst bit is the credits, when it finishes you off with a jazz-like song. That's the only thing I can say that's bad about it.A true landmark in movie history.",

A true detective story that respects the characters and one of those rare cases in which a comic film respects and embellishes established comic continuity. This movie touches upon the humanity of the character of Batman. It shows that one of the greatest super heroes ever is not a single-minded revenge machine. Instead this film shows the man that is batman. He loves, he laughs, he smiles, he hurts, he grieves, he's finally depicted as being human. The action is fair and balanced, this film opted to show Batman doing some good 'ol fashioned detective work instead of driving the bat-mobile up walls or clashing with scene chewing villains. The story is a classic who-done-it? mystery, it employs the use of flashbacks, which is often a cheesy plot device but they're done right and they interlace perfectly with the story and push it forward. The plot involves the murdering of many mob bosses, and the authorities pin the murders on Batman. Batman has to evade authorities and find out who is really doing the killings.",

There have been some shockers over the years, and I seem to be the only one who's not drooling over Batman Begins. Batman Begins was decent, but it's lacking something which this flick (and the series) have in stinking abundance: Style. The Batman animated series is so freaking classy; I just love it. The city is done perfectly; it is GOTHam after all, not New York. I totally dig the dark, gritty scenery, and the nighttime rain showers provide a haunting atmosphere. There is something that this series/film does which is hard to explain: they make Gotham believable, they make it seem real, and the flashbacks feel like history; not just character development. Little touches like the glimpses of characters in their younger lives add to this realism. I loved the scene with Bullock as a uniformed cop, and Joker as a sleazy criminal henchman; neither were overdone nor particularly over-dramatic. The development of batman was perfect too, not over the top at all. The directors/writers don't appear to feel the need to explain every little detail. Unlike a lot of blockbusters, they don't seem to be catering for the usual vegetables that need to be spoon fed. Maybe my cheese has slid off my cracker, but this seems like a intelligent filmThe reason I didn't give this 10: I took a star off because the Phantasm character was a teenie bit lame; the smoke disappearing act was pretty cheesy, along with a few other things about the character. The Phantasm was a deep character, don't get me wrong, just kinda hurts my little heart when the main antagonist turns out to be a goodie, oh well, as usual The Joker saves the day.The other star off is because of the song during the credits: simply unforgivable. There could have been a bit more of the Joker! Mark Hamil and the design artists are truly talented. Anyway, awesome movie and let's hope that we take entertainment back to the drawing board and bust out a few more decent western animations.",

            "content": "I have loved \"Batman: The Animated Series\" for the duration of my entire time on this Earth. Heck, I love Batman largely because of it. My favorite movie period is Christopher Nolan's \"The Dark Knight\", and I love that whole trilogy. Tim Burton's \"Batman\" and \"Batman Returns\" (which I like even more) are also incredible. I recently acquired the complete Batman animated series on Blu-ray and included with it were \"Batman & Mr. Freeze: SubZero\" (which was alright) and this film. I was very impressed with this movie. It's actually kind of a prequel/origin story for Batman in some ways. Guess you could say a \"Batman Begins\" that you can show to kids if you're not ready for them to see that one. That's not to imply that it is lesser than on it's own merits because it isn't as dark. I want to acknowledge the technical stuff first. It's not that surprising to me that the movie is beautifully animated, because the show is beautifully animated. It is praiseworthy though. I miss animation like this so much. But what impressed me more and what's been impressing me about the show also as I've been watching it recently is the sound mixing. The sound mixing is insane in this. Hearing the explosions, and punches, and the whooshing of the Batplane was a real joy. The same of course can be said of the musical score. Beautiful. The voice acting is really strong here too. The writing in this movie also is very good. The Phantasm and the motivations of this villain threw a curveball at me, and were surprisingly simpler than I thought they'd be. I wouldn't mind seeing a live-action interpretation of the character but changes would need to be made to conceal their identity. Or maybe not. It could still work. There were more characters in this movie than I was expecting also, and they fill the running time quite nicely without seeming to take more time away than necessary from Bruce/Batman. It's consistent in the way that it helps Gotham City feel like a real lived-in world, especially as it pertains to all of the lowlife criminals. And although I said it's kind of like a more appropriate \"Batman Begins\" for kids I still was surprised at the mature tone of it. But again, I don't know why. The series has always done that so well. This is wonderful. I was born in 1992 so I didn't see it in theaters for obvious reasons and I would have been a nuisance to everyone who did. It almost went straight to video but Warner Brothers made a last-minute decision to release it in theaters. It underperformed because of that last-minute decision, but in terms of quality, I'd say that they should have had a theatrical release in mind from the very beginning. One last thing : I'd recommend probably watching this first before you start watching the series given that it's a bit of an origin story and a prequel in some respects. But seeing it in any way certainly will add to your love of the show, because I'm just now seeing it as an adult who was born the same year that the show debuted. And I couldn't be happier that I did.",

The series did an amazing job of providing origins for many of Batman's famous villains. However, it never provided one for the title character. So, this is the team's way of creating a back story for their main character.When Bob Kane and Bill Finger created Batman back in 1939 they didn't feature an origin on the first issue. That was something they later dealt with and it wasn't even a full issue. It was just prologue for one of the stories. Bruce W. Timm and the rest of the gang remained true to that concept and don't exactly make this film into an origin tale. The origin is just back story for the actual plot. The plot is that a new vigilante has arrived into Gotham killing many mob bosses. Somehow Batman is confused for this new vigilante and he has to prove his innocence, while battling the Joker and catching up with an old girlfriend.Like the animated series this film is an amazing accomplishment. It's probably even better than Batman Begins. Too bad people don't see it because it's a cartoon.RATING: 4 (****) out of (****)",

            "content": "After looking at all these reviews, I'm sure that what I'm about to say is pretty redundant.  I'll say it anyway.This is film is, by far, the most accurate and most brilliant adaptation of the dark knight.  No other presentation of the Bat has captured it's true essence as this one has (including the 1989 film by Tim Burton).The film starts of with Batman breaking up a  counterfeit-money plot by the mob and immediately goes right into the meat of the story.  Gangsters are getting rubbed-out left and right.  The eye-witnesses are claiming to see hooded and caped figure at these crime scenes, which makes Batman the prime suspect.  If this isn't enough, a corrupt city councilman fronts his new re-election platform for eliminate the Bat ,for these murders ,at any cost. The timing couldn't be worse for the woman, who broke Bruces' heart ,to come back into town during all this. So Bruce has got his hands full will catching a killer, clearing his name and sorting out his feelings for his long-lost love.  This film out-does anything attempted in the tradition of Batman. 1. This film does what too may films failed or forgot to do, and that is actually focus the story on Batman.  The previous films gave too much attention on the corny and semi-campy villains.  Even the first Batman, as entertaining as it was , gave too much screen time to the Joker, and only skimmed the surface of who is Batman.  We learn more about the beginnings of Bruce Wayne, to understand his motives a little more intimately, from flash backs and events.  Kevin Conroys' voicing of Batman is so good, you'd wish he was casted in the live-action versions.2. This film keeps the situation down to earth with a simple murder mystery. No stupid large scale plots to poison people with smilax, steal the first born sons, brainwash with a stupid glow-box or freeze Gotham. This basic and non-childish premise was the basis for some potent suspense that challenged films like \"Die-Hard\" and \"The Fugitive\" The big chase between Batman and the swat-team had me on the edge of my seat chewing my nails to the bone.3. This film was not dumb it down for kids, (which the live-action films tend to do)  The story was serious and involving.  The dialogue and relationships were genuine.  Some of the more memorable scenes include this first prelude between Batman and Andrea Beaumont (Bruces' Ex) Another scene in the conversation between Bruce and Alfred.  As a matter of fact this film displays the best relationship with Bruce and Alfred.  \"You think you know everything about me ,don't you\" \"I diapered you bottom.  I bloody well oht to, SIR!\"Some viewers will criticize the animation quality of this film,  but I feel was original and appropriate for the needs of this film.  The musical score may be a little reminiscent on the old Danny Elfman themes, but since it was done by his original orcastrator, Sherley Walker, no harm, no foul.  Her score also lives up to the true Batman style.  The problems with this film, for starters, is that that it is too short. True ,for only 77mins, it seems to utilizes it's time well, but it should have been a bit longer to tie up the loose ends left behind.  We never find out if Batman ever gets to clear his name of the murders, or even how he is cleared. The big showdown with the Phantasm left the audience a little bit cheated, but the face off with the Joker compensated.  Yes the Joker is in this film  to and he is done very well by Mark Hamill.  Not to worry, this film is not short on surprises, so I won't blow any.  And if any reviews have, shame on you!!!Some may say that the ending left them hanging, but I believe that the very end of this film captured the true spirit of what Batman is all about.To sum up, no film has ever given the fans a better or more accurate depiction of the Batman legend as superbly and masterfully as this one.  It is the finest and most under-rated film in the last 50 years",

And while it didn't do that great at the box office, it's still such a good movie.The characters are amazing. Kevin Conroy's Batman feels genuine, and this time around, Batman's more somber side is shown, as opposed to the strong or detective-esque natures, as opposed to the Burton/Keaton films. Andrea's an amazing character, and I actually really love the twist where she's Phantasm, and seeing her die is equally saddening.Honestly, very underrated Batman film. 10/10.",

Now I enjoyed Batman + Batman Returns and I consider them fine additions to the Batman franchise, but they didn't focus on the title character as much as they should have. Phantasm patches things up where the live action films went wrong. Here we have Batman seen as the brooding avenger that he really is and we are given better insights as to why he became what he is. His parents don't just die and he decides to be a superhero. The conflict is much deeper than that and well done here. You actually got to know Bruce Wayne, as well as the Batman. Kevin Conroy is the best Batman, bar none. Keaton was good and West was fun, but Conroy simply rocks.Besides being true to the Batman mythos, it is a great film for other reasons. The score in this movie ties with Danny Elfman's and the Batman Beyond: Return of the Joker score for best score in a Batman film. The use of the choir in the movie was excellent. It was like the voices were speaking to Batman, haunting him and yet urging him on. It reminds me so much of the Crow (and that's always a good thing).The action in the movie is far from the cartoonish crap that's screwed up the last two Batflicks. We actually get the feeling that Batman may not make it out of here alive. The emotion in this movie is real and not the least bit wooden. The backstory drives at effective parallel to what's happening in the present story. Mark Hamill makes a great Joker (way better than Nicholson who took up too much screentime).There's nothing really left me to say except go see this movie. The animation may not be top notch, but the story and feeling is very much there. I can't praise it enough...",

            "content": "Batman mask of the phantasm for a long time was my favourite Batman movie. One of two theatrically released animated Batman films. This and the Lego Batman Movie. But this movie is phenomenal. The movie tackle's themes of destiny, revenge, love and promises. Mask of the phantasm delves into why Batman is Batman. How he made a promise to his parents, to not allow this to happen to anyone else. However, Batman meets a girl named Andrea. She makes Batman reconsider his promise and his plan. To have a normal life because he never considered that he could possibly ever be happy. Just like any tragedy, that opportunity is stripped away, and he is forced to becomes the batman. To prowl the city, stopping the criminal element from creating another Bruce Wayne. Batman is almost destined to go down this path. At the end of the movie, Batman is faced with the same dilemma, stay Batman, or live a normal life, but again, it is taken away from him and ends the movie where he started, nearly alone, forcing himself on his one-man crusade. The story however is about this mysterious phantasm figure coming to Gotham and picking off members from a gang, but, from afar, the phantasm looks like Batman, so all these killings are framed on Batman, turning the police and the public on Batman. Batman needs to solve these mystery's and stop the phantasm and prove his innocents. The flashbacks and origins are interwoven into the narrative, creating impact and adds to the film while also not overstaying it's welcome as the shortest Batman movie of all time, but the movie says all it needs to say in that time frame, not overstaying it's welcome. This movie is what Batman forever tried to be. An in-depth analysis of Batman, but while that movie went off the wall and also wanted to be a silly comic book movie, this animated feature manages to keep a consistent tone and takes itself seriously. Almost like a Greek tragedy. I won't spoil much since this is an underrated movie and not many people have seen it. I suggest you watch it, I won't spoil the ending or the identity of the phantasm, you'll just have to watch it yourself. The only gripe I could have about this movie is that by the end of the movie the police haven't exactly cleared Batman, so he is technically still a fugitive, yet the signal lights up in the sky. It's a powerful ending, but that's just a small criticism in a near perfect movie.(9.8/10)",

Batman, obviously, is not guilty, he is spotted at the scene moments after a mysterious figure vacates. What makes Phantasm so important is the human struggle of Bruce Wayne, as we see him go through heartbreak in various flashbacks, as he is forced to confront his troubled past when it threatens his wellbeing and stature in the present. Another interesting development is Mark Hamill's Joker, sidelined to a bit part although still crucial to the story. Nolan's Dark Knight put the Joker front and centre, grinding Batman almost into the ground; but Phantasm leaves the Joker as an irritant in Batman's side, and focuses on Wayne's personal troubles. It makes for an interesting and effective story, and one that if we'd gone without, we almost certainly wouldn't have seen Nolan's trilogy in the same form as it is.",

It doesn't feel like the same show, and has all the telltale beats of an average live action movie.\n\nCreating a new character like the Phantasm would be awesome if it was introduced in an episode and the story arc stretched out over a season, but to cram it an hour and half, it is such a cheap version of what it could be, I wouldn't have even bothered as it removes the option to do it correctly later.\n\nIt was kind of nice to see the Joker, but if you're going to have him make an appearance, he might as well be the focus of the movie.\n\nUltimately, any story that is more about Bruce Wayne than Batman outside the comics is just not going to be that entertaining.",

A sort of spin off of the Batman Animated Series this version of Batman is actually set in the 1940's (yet somehow may or may not connect with the universe it's too hard to really explain). The movie tells the early story of Bruce Wayne (Kevin Conroy) and his romance with Andrea Beaumont (Dana Delany). It's sort of told through flashbacks about how he eventually becomes The Batman. Fast forward ten years later and Gotham city is under attack by the mysterious Phantasm a masked vigilante that is killing people and pinning the murders on Batman. It's up to Batman to figure out who this mysterious villain is and save the day. There's obviously more to it than that, but i won't spoil the good stuff. This is a nice tight well written story that has a fantastic villain arch to it all. I enjoyed this movie 26 years ago and still enjoyed rewatching it now.

This movie earned its rating of PG because unlike disney who just want the whole family to come and spend their money, this movie wants parents to be there in case this movie is a little too graphic. The story in this movie is fairly decent as you and Batman try to figure out who the Phantasm is. Then the Joker enters, being written perfectly and voiced by Mark Hamill, continuing Batman (Kevin Conroy) vs. the Joker (Mark Hamill) like another episode of BTAS (Batman the animated series). The reveal of the phantasm is the worst of this movie, because it made no goddamned sense. When ever the Phantasm was near Batman they were about the same height, but after the reveal (Andrea) you realize she is about a half a head taller, or whatever height she decides to morph to since her height in the movie is so damn inconsistent. Then the movie ends with a bang, and a hoorah for Batman, even though now he is sad that Andrea is \"dead\".",

I just love how he genuinely acts as a detective piecing together clues, and he flat out refuses to kill people. He also didn't have an artificial Batman voice that sounded like someone who had just finished gargling gravel, thanks to the superb work by Kevin Conroy. In fact, the voice work throughout the film was second to none, particularly Conroy as Bruce/Batman and Mark Hamill as the Joker. I also couldn't get enough of the score. Composer Shirley Walker did some remarkable things with the music and helped to intensify the atmosphere and also amp up the excitement of action scenes. I never watched the animated series (I haven't watched that many cartoons since I was a child) but the look of the film was solid. At times it seems a little too goofy, considering how dark they are trying to set the tone, but I think it gels fairly well.\n\nZack Snyder could have taken a lesson from Mask of the Phantasm to learn how to remind the audience of the death of the Waynes and what that means to Bruce. With nothing more than a picture on the wall and a visit to the grave we 100% understand without needing to see pearls falling to the ground again. However, the story-telling in Mask of the Phantasm wasn't always that solid and concise. I had some significant problems with the way the movie constantly jumped back-and-forth in time. If they were thinking about it more, they would have included a simple visual cue that would clue us into whether we were watching the past or the present. It's not a good sign when you have a film-viewer like myself being tempted to pause at the beginning of each new scene in order to figure out where we were in the timeline. The twist at the end is easy for most people to guess, but I didn't mind all that much because they cast suspicion on enough people that the reveal could have been different, so it was still a solid mystery.\n\nThere is a romance plot in the film which was necessary to the story, but I wasn't really convinced of their affection for one another. I think that stems from the fact that the movie skipped over some of the courtship moments in their relationship and just expected the audience to accept that the love was there. I was surprised that the movie left things relatively open and unresolved at the end, but I assume that was intended so that the story could fold back into the animated series. One opportunity that I feel like they missed was the chance to have Batman in a position where he's forced to defend the Joker. Because of his vow not to kill (or let people die) they had the chance to create a much stronger moment by putting the Joker's life on the line instead of Andrea. If Batman was given no alternative than to save his arch nemesis it would be marvelous. That's not to say the movie was bad for not doing what I wanted, I just saw the squandered potential for greatness. The film was a gem, though. It is definitely well-made and I'd say it's better than at least 3 live action movies starring Batman.",

            "content": "Batman: Mask of the Phantasm is directed by Eric Radomski and Bruce Timm who were the creators of Batman: The Animated Series, and it stars Kevin Conroy, Mark Hamill, and Dana Delany in an animated superhero film about Batman doing his usual stuff, until his ex-girlfriend comes back to Gotham, and 2 weeks before she was there, a new villain named Phantasm starts killing gang members, leaving people to believe that it was Batman that did it as they both look a little similar. When I first heard of it, it was from a YouTube video where the Joker has his well known laugh, and ever since then, I wanted to watch the movie, but however, it wasn't in a rental store nor the city library. So I got impatient and just buy it on Amazon, and got it about a week later. For their first film that's part of the animated series, I really enjoyed it. The voice acting is fantastic as I really believed that Kevin Conroy is really Batman, and Mark Hamill is Joker. The animation is really impressive as it  was just about all of it were hand drawn, and I'm glad they stuck with it as it could've been easier to do it all in computer animation. The story doesn't feel like an extended episode, and you actually don't need to watch the show in order to understand the film as it gives enough information about Batman/Bruce Wayne, and the old villain from the animated series like the Joker. The writing by Alan Burnett, Paul Dini, Martin Pasko, and Michael Reaves is great that it shown something that none of the live-action Batman films haven't done, are what Bruce Wayne's life is like before he became Batman, and actually seeing him do some detective work as none of the film's focused on his actual persona that's similar to the comics. It gives some laughs when it doesn't take it serious from the Joker, but when it gets serious, it does, and it gets suspenseful at times while also giving some fun fights. The only small problem about the film is that even though the kids are going to be shocked on the twist reveal, but for adults, it seem a little obvious on it, which I picked up on it too, even though it's not a bad twist, it's just not a shocking one. While it may not be as entertaining as The Dark Knight Trilogy or Tim Burton's Batman films, I can say that Batman: Mask of the Phantasm is the closest film that we got that shows what Batman actually is like.",

            "content": "Who ever thought an animated superhero movie was a good idea? Probably not that many people in the'90s, as they were already used to all the live action comic book adaptations they had been receiving for years. Additionally, the film's marketing campaign did not consist of all that much advertising at all, causing it to fly under the radar and perform underwhelmingly at the box office.\n\nBut more and more people are discovering this movie every passing year, and they're finding that, well, it's a really good Batman film. It has its flaws, for sure, but I can guarantee that the majority of Batman fans and non-fans alike will be able to find something in Mask of the Phantasm.\n\nOne minor negative I had with this film is a certain lack of emotional stakes. Personally, I simply often find it hard to take action seriously in cartoon movies, as it is seldom done very well. For me, Phantasm at times worked in this aspect, and other times didn't deliver the thrills I wanted it to.\n\nHowever, that's just my opinion. And generally speaking, it doesn't bother me that much, because the story and the characters are so perfectly crafted in this film that you can't help but feel the same feeling that 1989's Batman and 2008's The Dark Knight left you with.\n\nAnd is it as good as The Dark Knight? No, because that movie is pretty much the perfect superhero movie. But is it as terrible as Batman & Robin? Of course not. However, I do think it's the best animated Batman movie, and I'd also say it's even better than both Batman Returns and Batman Forever. Batman: Mask of the Phantasm is a clever, innovative animated film that I had a lot of fun with. Though it can't really match the intensity of some slightly superior Batman movies, Phantasm is sure to entertain audiences everywhere, and marks a solid entry in the DC Comics canon.\n\nRATING: B+",

Higher production values were put to good use as the movie's animation is sharp, while featuring more detailing in its art design as well as a more vivid color palette, without of course taking away from the noire aesthetic.\n\nThe plot surrounds the mystery behind the Phantasm, rooted by a look at the origins of Batman, and by extension Bruce Wayne's early adulthood. It also makes for a tragic love story, thus establishing Bruce's unwillingness to commit to a relationship. And, unlike the Animated series, it isn't afraid to portray more violent imagery, along with the death of human characters, one in particular getting an absolutely shocking reveal.\n\nSpeaking of which, the operatic music that couples the soundtrack also adds to the horror surrounding Phantasm and the film's noire aesthetic altogether. It is nothing short of stellar. The voice acting also holds up.\n\nMy only complaint is that it ends on a cliffhanger that is solved off-screen, while its drama comes off as a bit schmaltzy, although all this could be due to the running time falling short; a necessary trade-off for focusing on the film's overall quality.\n\nThat said, Mask of the Phantasm is a must-see Batman movie. Along with what was said prior, the suspense and action are bumped up a notch for constant thrills, even during its bits of origin exposition. And while I'm not familiar with the source material, and besides loving the Tim Burton live-action Batman films, Mask of the Phantasm probably is as close to the source material as it gets.",

Unlike the campy 1960s version of Batman, this version is half-mad from the superhero's obsession with justice. It is only his unusual sense of ethics that keeps him from becoming a full-blown psychotic. The story describes the origins of Batman as it follows the Dark Knight's attempts to capture the elusive, deadly Phantasm who kills a crime lord and makes it look as if Batman did it, causing a media smear campaign against the Caped Crusader. At the same time, millionaire Bruce Wayne holds a party at his mansion. There he meets Councilman Arthur Reeves, the man behind the accusations. Reeves derides playboy Wayne for allowing his college sweetheart Andrea Beaumont to leave him. Suddenly Wayne flashes back to his pre-Batman days. He remembers how he met her while visiting his parents' graves to renew his vow that he would spend his life fighting crime to avenge their wrongful deaths.

The animation is brings us into the gothic style that batman is best known for. The final reason is the story. The story is so fast-paced, engaging and makes us feel for the characters. This movie should be called \"Making a Batman film 101\" because if your going to make a batman movie than it should have all the three reasons i explained above. I feel bad because this movie sometimes gets underrated, and did poorly in the cinema. It is a wonderful movie that deserves as much praise as the acclaimed Nolan films",

Mask of the Phantasm is an in depth psychological analysis of our hero when a figures of his past return to haunt him in a way he never could have expected. Timm and Radomski continue the groundbreaking TV series in this film. The apperance of a vigilante known as the Angel of Death murdering mob figures in Gotham, the blame is put on The Dark Knight as he investigates it begins to lead to his past and a stunning revelation of emotion, and doubt. \n\nThis is not only the definitive animated movie of the Batman, but also one of the character's defining moments in general. This film delves straight into the mythos of the character as well as the Animated Series itself to bring forth a film that is very dark, very personal. The pacing is great and very mysterious,the animation of the series is retained and does it ever look amazing in a film with a bigger budget. The film as well gives Bruce Wayne a love interest that has more to do with the story than that would seem as well as tying the Phantasm in with Batman's greatest foe, the Joker. \n\nThe music fits perfectly with the film and the action scenes are very well done. Batman in the animated series has always been the most true to the comics in terms of his dialogue, actions and intellect. Kevin Conroy is the definitive voice of the character he is purely a genius he gives the character an edge a drive and an emotion like no other voice actor can for the character. His voice has become identified with the role. The exact same can be said about Mark Hamill and voicing the Joker, his Joker's manical laugh is iconic and deadly. The Joker of the animated series has always been dark, gruesome and a psychopath and most of these props go to Hamill's intense voicing of the character.  Both have voiced their respective characters in the DCAU, as well as various DC animated film adaptions and most recently the excellent and jaw dropping Batman: Arkham video games.\n\nMask of the Phantasm from start to its climatic ending and the triumphant final scene is true to the character and as one critic pointed out, he is Gotham's savior truly the way he was meant to be.",
