            "content": "Robert Altman has never shied away from casting every actor known to mankind in his films, and this is certainly true with his 1993 film \"Short Cuts\", a film set in Los Angeles over the course of a couple of days. In terms of primary actors, ones that had a substantial enough part to merit a supporting tag, I count at least 22; but more impressive than the sheer number of the cast is the fact that the film does not suffer from character overload, nor do their intertwining stories (and they are all separated by no more than one or two degrees).I started this review by going through each character and the story each brings to the table, but after about three paragraphs worth of explanation, it is clear that it is not only a bad idea, but probably counterproductive to the review itself. \"Short Cuts\" is simply about human relationships, all of which seem to be completely unhealthy. The beauty of Altman's script and direction is that this isn't imminently apparent in all cases. Something as subtle as a sigh and a minor roll of the eyes speaks volumes in a film this well done. The acting in the film is, to be expected, great in most cases. Andie MacDowell, though not quite as insipid as usual, is still pretty bad, but gems like Lyle Lovett, Peter Gallagher, Tom Waits (who I am really biased toward) and a fairly fresh and new Julianne Moore more than make up for any minor acting mishaps.There are not many films that are so involved that I simply throw up my hands at the prospect of doing my standard summary review for them, but \"Short Cuts\" is one of them. The script is compelling enough to easily sit through all 187 minutes of the film, the ending doesn't disappoint, and the film contains a cool jazz score. If you're a fan of ensemble films, this should be on your list. If you're an Altman fan, this should be on your short list because I consider it to be one of his best. 8/10 --Shelly",

            "content": "In front of a group of fishermen, a waitress bends over for a slab of butter.  They take in the image like hungry wolves gulping meat, as her skirt rises high, revealing everything.  They like what they see, so they ask her, `Can we have more butter, please?'  The double meaning is obvious.In a nightclub, a singer languishes over a sultry little song about `a good, punishing kiss.'  The conversation in the foreground -- ex-cons relating cruel, violent stories from prison -- moves to the rhythm of the jazz saxophone, a dissonant snare-drum-prose accompaniment to the song.  It's a deliberate ambiguity that binds the viewer in the scene's artistic tension.  In an upscale home with a breathtaking view of the city of angels, a struggling artist is being questioned about her relationship with another artist.  She's naked from the waist down, suggesting both sexual aggressiveness, and vulnerability, simultaneously.  She's seductively defiant with her husband.  She confesses to an affair;  but she does so angrily, indignant for being asked.  It's sweet and sour, light and dark, truthful but deceptive, all at once.  More double entendres. \nRobert Altman's Short Cuts weaves all these disconnected scenes together like common strands of rope.  It's the interplay of opposites that firmly holds them all together.  The title itself, `Short Cuts,' has dual meaning: it's an interconnected mixture of `short cuts,' as in `off the cutting room floor' or `film clips;'  and, it's an unmistakable reference to the web of human life, the social short cuts between ourselves and everyone else, as in the famous `six degrees of separation,' which tells us that we are only six personal relationships away from everyone else in the world.  Set in LA, this idea makes for a lovely irony:  although the main characters are completely absorbed in their individual worlds, they are intimately connected to each other.  They just don't know it.  Short Cuts is one of Altman's masterpieces.  See it if you can.",

            "content": "Spoilers herein.Altman is uneven, and not all of his failures are interesting. But he does one thing better than anyone else. And so far as I know, he invented it. Most filmmakers start with someone else's vision, and then make it real. The better ones have their own vision, and the story is a framework for their art. But either way, the work is divided between the creative talent (the writer and director and other supporting trades) and the performers.Altman does things the other way around. He starts with large groups of exceptionally talented actors, gives them little direction, shoots mountains of takes, and then weaves it all together. The life of the film emerges from the actors. Then Altman takes that motion, those rhythms and plays them against one another. It is as close as one can get to cinematic jazz, at least jazz from actors.P T Anderson is first a writer. His primary creation is the script. So while `Magnolia' bears some superficial resemblance to `Short Cuts.' it is a completely different beast. Chamber music compared to jazz. A more apt comparison is to `The Thin Red Line,' which works with the same sort of jazz weave, except the focus in `Line' is on remembrances through sounds and voiceovers. Here the focus is on the immediate miniensembles.This is quite simply one of the most important films of the decade.It must be sort of a Rorschach test to report which characters impressed the most. In terms of the character for me it was Lori Singer's character. Strange. She really is playing the cello, and with passion. She really is playing something `totally, absolutely real, but not.' But her career otherwise seems to not have taken off.Moore and Downey are among the best actors alive, and it really shows. Robbins, McDormand and Leigh sometimes are extraordinarily  great, but not so here -- they apparently need guidance. Tomlin and Waits are a gas. What fun. My only complaint is that sometimes Altman puts together shockingly long and complex tracking shots, and they are missing here. They would detract from the players.",

            "content": "When Altman is good he's among the greatest, and SHORT CUTS is among his best (M*A*S*H, BREWSTER McCLOUD, NASHVILLE). Adapted from Raymond Carver's collection of stories, SHORT CUTS offers a roving, restless glimpse into the lives of several Los Angelinos. The characters aren't completely real - in an 'I-can-relate-to-these-people' sense (I never expected this from this movie anyway), but are presented in a slightly hyperreal sense with Altman highlighting the everyday lives of characters who try valiantly to maintain their public personas (cutting across class boundaries in the process), even when things are spinning out of control beneath the surface (literally symbolized by the ending, though at least he didn't stoop to throwing in a rain of frogs...). Los Angeles is famously mocked as a place that's all surface and no depth (see ANNIE HALL), and the slight exaggerations seen here characters plays with this, even as the isolation and instability of certain characters humanizes them. Through it all there's plenty of humor - though, as is usual with Altman, even the humor packs a wallop. Annie Ross' deadpan complaint gets to the heart of it all: \"I hate L.A. - all they do is snort coke and talk.\" The irony in such nastiness becomes a bit more apparent when you consider where that assessment is coming from, within Altman's tragi-comic variant upon the notion that California's trends become America's truisms a decade or two down the road.There are so many great moments here - Chris Penn's growing befuddlement (and seething, simmering murderous anger) with his wife's phone sex operator job; Tom Waits and Lily Tomlin as a boozy working class couple; Peter Gallagher and Frances MacDormand's marriage, collapsed into tantrums and furniture vandalism; the Tim Robbins/Huey Lewis confrontation; Jack Lemmon, Julianne Moore and Matthew Modine all deliver strikingly memorable performances. Every time I watch this, I get something new out of it - though it requires a bit of patience, SHORT CUTS is really worth checking out.",

            "content": "The many residents of Robert Altman's \"Short Cuts\" do so much more than  that: they lie, cheat, steal, kill, ache, long, burn-out, shine bright,  fade in the background, sing, dance, drink, make love, screw, shout,  scream, fight, and purge their souls-though few ever really listen or  watch closely.  \"Short Cuts\" is arguably Altman's finest film (with nods to \"MASH,\"  \"Nashville,\" \"The Player,\" and \"Gosford Park\"). It's also probably the  best of the sub-genre of intertwining vignette films, the overlapping  mosaics that Altman trail-blazed. It's odd, because had I seen \"Short  Cuts\" before I viewed P.T. Anderson's \"Magnolia\" (which I loved upon  first view but not so much the second time around), I would've realized  that film was an eerie knockoff of this Altman classic--right down to  the casting of Julianne Moore and Jack Lemmon. \"Magnolia\" is full of  nervousness, operatic melodrama, and ham-fisted symbolism, whereas  \"Short Cuts\" is full of smooth transitions, hyper-realism, and keen  insights into human behavior. I'll take the earthquake at the end of  \"Short Cuts\" over the raining frogs of \"Magnolia\" any day.  Altman's film runs well over three hours and features nearly twenty  main characters. As such, it's one of those movies where everyone will  have their personal favorite bits and characters. I found Lori Singer's  cello playing daughter of a booze-hound jazz singer, Anne Archer's  empathy riddled clown, and Frances McDormand's young son who insists on  telling everyone about how he feels about his toys (which are showered  on him in the absence of real love) though no one ever pays him any  direct attention, to be the most compelling. There's also some great  bits involving a dog and Tim Robbin's adulterous cop, and a hilariously  disturbing mix up at a photo hut involving Lilly Taylor and a  fisherman.  With Mr. Altman now passed, one wonders, will anyone ever be able to  make a film like this again? Surely not. \"Short Cuts\" is nothing short  of a masterpiece and a testament to Altman's unique brand of  film-making and humanistic view of the misanthropic world he inhabited.",

I could not help but think that this collage of events in the lives of 22 people in sunny LA was realism.  Not the harsh gritty realism of 'Taxi Driver', but a different realism.  This movie is who we are, as people.  This movie chronicles the emotions we may have when confronted with a persistent crank caller, or the lingering suspicion of a partner's affair. And the acerbic intelligence of the script is tempered with director Altman's stunning technical virtuosity.The style is very pastiche, and one scene cuts to another, as the title suggests, with reckless abandon.  This lends a very fresh and watchable quality to what is by any standards a long film.  While most of the characters never meet, the movie is given shape by the connections between scenes.  The connections are of two kinds: thematic connections for which the credit goes to the script, and also visual connections whereby the direction and editing employed by Altman allow him to create recurring imagery with which he weaves the sprawling, kicking constituent bits and pieces of this movie together.  This style works very well indeed and at the end of the film, miraculously you are left not with the impression of having just watched a series of 'short cuts', but something entirely more holistic in nature.There was not a false note in the acting and the star-studded cast did great justice to a remarkable script.  The casting is flawless, from Tim Robbins' adulterous cop to Julianne Moore's adulterous painter. The camera-work is refreshing in its fluidity and control, transmitting an intense watchability. However many feelings there are in the human emotional vocabulary (and I am sure there are a fair few), it seems that 'Short Cuts' is somehow able, in the course of three hours, to display (in the actors) and evoke (in the audience), each and every one of them.  For those who are of the belief that modern Hollywood is unable to produce films of artistic merit, watch this movie now or hold your peace forever.",

Featuring an all-star cast featuring a host of great character actors including Tim Robins, Julianne Moore, Jennifer Jason Leigh to name a few.The performances are wonderful without exception (even Andie McDowell does OK). The intertwining stories are interesting up until the end - three hours goes past almost effortlessly and unnoticed. My only problem with the film is the lack of any real emotional punch or meaning in all of the stories. The majority of the stories have the potential for strong emotions to draw the audience in but the majority don't let it out too much (like real life I suppose), the one story that does let the characters feel (the story of McDowell's child) is not that convincing. Some of the stories don't make a lot of sense and don't feel based in reality. Compared to Magnolia, Glengarry Glen Ross, 12 Angry Men and other ensemble pieces this engages on an interest level but lacks an emotional involvement. I know that this is often on critic's top-ten lists but I felt that interesting stories and great acting do not make up for the lack of an emotional centre to the film.

Normally, understanding that Altman's style is one of using confusion and misunderstandings to move the plot along, I was surprised when I reacted so positively to MASH, Nashville and The Player but not this.The cast, overall, is quite good with Robert Downey Jr. and Madeline Stowe giving the best performances along with the great Jack Lemmon in perhaps the scene with the only real emotional pull as he describes the sad truth of why his family broke apart. Everyone else seems lost and misguided, floating around in this LA world Altman is exploring without much to do. They act out, involving themselves in affairs, drugs, their children's lives and the simple desire to survive each day but none of it particularly moved me. Even one plot line involving Bruce Davison and Andie MacDowell that should have had great emotional depth has almost none to speak of.I have the greatest admiration for Altman and his ambitious vision of how to create interesting stories and characters. Yet, despite many claiming this to be one of his best works, I didn't feel at all that it was on par with MASH or Nashville as it seemed to meander and sag heavily in the middle until a final occurrence brought many of the characters together. This may be what Altman wanted; the meaningless and accidental nature of many of life's adventures that nevertheless still affect us. However, I wish it would have been made more cinematically stimulating.",

Fishermen can't be bothered to stop fishing to get a dead woman out of the water. One even shoots what looks like a whole roll of film of her naked body floating in the streams/lake/river, who knows? And, apparently only one cares - Fred Ward's wife, Anne Archer.That is the theme that I felt throughout the film where Los Angeles residents were misunderstanding, resenting, deceiving, disappointing -- and even killing -- one another.

But Altman's greatest achievements were satires, and this movie is deadly serious with not many laughs. If the individual stories had been told straight-forwardly (and the length of the film drastically reduced), the several resulting films might have been pretty good -- not great; they are too thin for greatness. But the acting is excellent and the individual stories are good, forgetting the overlapping plots and cross-cutting script. The movie has been described (accurately) as a mosaic. But what makes any mosaic good or bad is the overall impression that it leaves. And the most significant impression \"Short Cuts\" left with me was that it was far, far too long. The empty lives of Los Angeles residents from different social classes has been told before and more pointedly. For the most part, it's hard to care about the profoundly disagreeable people who populate most, though not all, of these stories. And, clever as always in creating mosaic films, Altman did not in this case display the temperament that made other of his movies truly great.

            "content": "Short Cuts, one of the best films I've ever seen, is a tableau, a framework that goes over the differing but similar threads of the human condition like it's as natural as can be. In any other director's hands these characters would be just that, quirky and a little too odd or melodramatic or not queued to the right level of comedy. Robert Altman, however, is the perfect director for the material, as he takes all these situations, these stories, these moments of irony, scorn, escapism into other lovers or drugs or some kind of art, of the connection between parents and kids, husbands and wives, total strangers to the dead, and fashions a piece of Americana that (dare I say it) is even more revelatory and funnier than Altman even at his very best, eg Nashville. The layers to it all are nearly staggering, and I'm sure that on just a first viewing I only got the surface of it all, which is excellent on its own. But it's just in seeing what goes on between these couple dozen or so people in Los Angeles- the desperation, the grief, the momentary lapse of reason, the infidelities, hatred, love, all strung together seamlessly, and with the knowledge that the absurdities (and there are many subtle and strange in the three-hour-plus running time) it's got something for everyone.The cast is ranged from Hollywood professionals, a couple of legends, character actors, Altman regulars, musicians, and it all clicks just right. Elements outside of the characters' control bookend the film, almost as if to add those little touches of anxiety that don't have something to do with the people's choices or bits of circumstance, with a city-wide bug-spraying intruding on some of the characters, and at the end an earthquake snapping them (or not) to their senses. There's a high-strung cop (Robbins) who can't stand the family dog. His wife (Stowe) is the sister of a painter (Moore), who has a conservative-about-sex-minded doctor husband (Modine) who doesn't understand her paintings but even less so her possible infidelity three years before. He's treating a child that got run over by a waitress (Tomlin), whose parents (MacDowell and Davison) can't understand why he's not waking up, and the father is a little more than surprised that his father (Lemmon) has come back after years gone. Meanwhile, Moore and Modine have to have a couple of guests (Archer and Ward) for dinner, where there is tension from the husband not reporting, and instead fishing around, a dead body of a girl in a river. And meanwhile the waitress has a slug of a husband (Tom Waits), and who's daughter (Taylor) has a boyfriend who's...And so on. That's not all, though if I kept writing more about these characters there wouldn't be much room left in the review. But in what goes on with the characters in a few days and nights time one can see as much as one can know about the characters. The depth of characterization is rich and deep as can possibly be accomplished, and even when a scene feels a little loose in how its acted around, as in a documentary (i.e. the picnic scene), it's still intriguing. Altman's camera follows these people at times finding the rhythm when it comes, and he never misses a beat, and even makes some fresh ones, like a zoom-in as a phone rings for Davison about his kid from a psycho stalker (Lovett), or how he wanders through the jazz club where Tess Trainer does her songs night after night for people who \"snort coke and talk.\" And like something akin to Fanny and Alexander- also a film supremely in touch with human nature's highs and lows- Altman, through Carver's material, mines for the roughest moments of drama and the kookiest moments of comedy, both low-key and high-pitch.The way that mood weaves around between the sadness, sometimes shallow and sometimes very deeply in hurt, and the bizarre mundane qualities and irony, is also incredible. There's a scene where cop Robbins stops clown Archer, in full regalia, and asks in jest how many clowns can be fit in the car. Or Waits (who probably gives his best acting performance to date) when he gets into a heated argument with Tomlin, but doesn't forget to have a quick drink before getting into the car. Or the racial tension at the jazz club, predominantly black, where Leigh gets propositioned. Or in one of the funniest moments of the film where Peter Gallagher's character, tearing up the place of his wife (McDormand) once finding out she's been sleeping with another man (Robbins), gets someone at the door while he's whittling with the chainsaw saying that his wife's won a prize- a vacuum cleaner. And surprisingly enough, though effectively so, it becomes all the more interesting when characters don't meet, and how through Altman's point of view it's what the people who are together know and don't know about one another, what connections aren't made or broken off, that makes it so compelling.Altman doesn't kid himself, or the audience, that there are easy answers for the characters, that things will all wrap up nicely by the end with the earthquake. It's by not going for the conventional routes that he challenges the audience, but doesn't make it too obvious. It's in this that he is most courageous and masterful at relaying life's little moments through the behavior of the people, at how there are telling signs of loss (or intensity) of emotional connection. And yet Short Cuts is also truly entertaining, and as one of the first of the slew of 'LA epics' ala Magnolia, Crash and Grand Canyon, it certainly trumps them all for the sense of humor spread throughout, and at the least is the most fearless. At three-hours long, it just isn't enough. A++",

            "content": "This is without a doubt my favorite Robert Altman movie!!! The immense amount of acting talent in the film is incredible!! All of the different story lines pan out to whereby a myriad of instances effectively depict how people really are, and not how they perceive themselves to be!! The emotional augmentation of introverted feelings and quirky lifestyles in \"Short Cuts\" manifest themselves to a point of rudimentary selfishness with virtually every one of the pivotal characters in the film!! The lack of a necessary and preliminary confrontation with everybody ultimately leads to a copious quantity of latent hostilities!!! Taciturn proclivities become a lethal weapon for all of the running characters in this movie!! ..Social mediocrity is not just about an inadequate household income, or a meager pecuniary net worth, but also, how the average person lacks the psychological stamina to candidly assume his position on any given issue, whether it be personal, political or otherwise!! Robert Altman itemizes a devious element of human interaction that ruthlessly erupts a plethora of instances which illustrate a mollified functional insanity through a fusillade of formidable and tumultuous bits and pieces!! I for one, found this approach to be extremely intriguing!! I indulged the entire genre of this film with a macabre enthusiasm. An integral motif to this movie became a case of everyone's situation getting relegated to the despondent plight of accepting the ramifications of avoidable character inadequacies!!Let's delve into some of the characters: You had a lot of the \"Sex, Lies and Videotape\" cast (Andie McDowell and Peter Gallagher)With them, you encountered a lot of the same agitated torment!! Jack Lemmon had a bit role, he was very believable as an apathetic prototype of the fragmented curmudgeon!! Lily Tomlin exemplified the impervious lower middle class deviate to an empathetic state of reasonable plausibility in this film!! She was constantly stalemated by everyone around her, and ultimately became the proverbial victim of her isolated environment!! The typical L.A. Cop was so believable!! He thought he was God's gift to the world! As a matter of fact, all of the segments in \"Short Cuts\" were superbly executed, however,the segment I found to be the most fascinating was the YUPPIE couple that this movie paired off!! (Julianne Moore and Matthew Modine) They were the urban W.A.S.P.'s who became afflicted by modern immorality!! Attempting to be appropriately \"Liberal\", their basically provincial ideas inhibited them from properly communicating with each other!! This revelation emanated a volatile rancor which was about as subtle as the United States surprise attack of nuclear fireworks on Hiroshima and Nagasaki at the end of WWII!! All of the correlating plots to \"Short Cuts\" are intertwined, one picking up where the other one left off, as they all seem to be tossing around a Frisbee of absolute moral oblivion and debauchery!!SO!! What was the resonating potpourri of philosophies in this movie? What was the aggregate collage of convoluted ethics? What was the proletariat's's pot luck stew of calamity here? As it turns out, the most crucial dilemmas in \"Short Cuts\" were the inane ones: No birthday cake!! My wife is not wearing underwear because she thinks she's one of her paintings!! The ubiquitous and arrogant attitude of \"Because I said so!!\" I need a part time job, how about phone sex? The utterly trite and solicitous plea of \"It should not be that difficult to understand that I just do not want to accept responsibility!!\" Enmity in my present and previous domiciles is the prevailing villain for motivating my belligerence!! Last but not least, we all got away with something!! Watch the movie to find out what!! Robert Altman's compendium of cosmopolitan neurotics evokes a precarious form of nauseating reality for all parties concerned!! I thought this film was excellent because the characters were all indisputably self serving!! Add insult to injury, they were not even good at it!! Such a peculiar depiction of these thwarted individuals throws caution to the wind about receiving an Oscar, and focuses more on Altman's quest for professional integrity!! The petty preoccupations of such non-corresponding individuals, as demonstrated in \"Short Cuts\", would indicate that perhaps the most coveted accolade in which Robert Altman wanted to be the recipient of was one of accomplishing a unique perspective of audited emotional reality!!!! \"M*A*S*H was Alman's trophy case movie, \"Short Cuts\" is more of an alternative film which spurred on a heinous angle of domestic identification!! Whether they are burdened with financial problems or not, everyone in this film is seeking an unearned gratification of one form or another!! \"Short Cuts\" is very similar to the movie \"Crash\" I am probably one of the few people who likes it better, \"Short Cuts\" engages in an insidious perspective of human behavior on an intellectual level. People's afflictions in \"Short Cuts\" were cerebral!! In the movie \"Crash\" they were about violence!! More movies should pinpoint the pejorative aspects of human nature like \"Short Cuts\" did!! People are more like this movie portrays them to be than they are on generic television programs!! I guess convictions and societal accountability are just entirely too much trouble!!",

It's really hard to explain what Short Cuts is about -- or is it really about anything?  Like most Altman films -- Short Cuts has a voyeuristic feel to it.  It feels like we are eavesdropping on the most private moments of people's lives.  With over 22 main characters -- that's a lot of people to get to know, but Short Cuts manages to make a memorable character out of every one of them.  This is a truly great film.  My favorite performance in the film: Either Lyle Lovett the baker or Tim Robbins as the cop.  Also features full frontal nudity by Julianne Moore.  This movie has everything.",

            "content": "\"Short Cuts\" is made up of a number of Raymond Carver's brilliant short stories. Although Carver wrote them as separate stories, in the film they are linked in clever and unexpected ways.I was surprised to learn that a number of reviewers criticised Altman's tone, and the fragmentation the stories underwent to create the script. However, I think it shows his genius in pulling the stories together to make a continuous narrative.The film opens as helicopters spray Los Angeles to eradicate Medfly. As the helicopters pass over the city, the camera zooms down and selects a number of people from the millions below. The lives of these people are brought into sharp focus, allowing the audience to share their pain, secrets and desires. Self-absorption is a trait shared by many of the characters; they appear to be concerned only with themselves. Even when they learn that terrible things have happened to others, their reactions are often superficial and unaffected.Altman has been criticised for having too cynical an attitude towards the characters, anticipating their failure in a way that Carver did not in his stories. However, a number of the characters in the film grow though adversity and many of them are basically good people.Of them all, it is the highway patrolman played by Tim Robbins, the character who seemed to have the least chance of redemption, who undergoes the most dramatic transformation.Neighbourhood watch takes on a new meaning when neighbours ask a couple played by Lili Taylor and Robert Downey Jnr, to mind their apartment, but they move in, throwing parties and having sex in the bed.Jennifer Jason Leigh plays a phone sex worker who deals with her client's calls while she feeds her baby, however she is never in the mood for sex with her husband played by Chris Penn. His repressed feelings erupt in the film's most disturbing sequence.It almost seems reasonable when three guys on a fishing trip decide not to report a dead body until after they have finished fishing. Later, the morality of their decision becomes an issue.Much of the film centres on two families who live side by side. Bruce Davidson and Andie McDowell play the Finnigans whose eleven-year-old son, Casey, is in hospital after being hit by a car. Before the accident, Mrs Finnigan goes to a bakery to organise a cake for her son's birthday. The baker, played by Lyle Lovett, becomes enmeshed in their lives in an unexpected way.Tess and Zoe played by Annie Ross and Lori Singer live next door to the Finnigans. They each react differently to Casey's accident but it leads to a tragedy just as great. Tess and Zoe are the only characters not drawn from Carver's stories.Jack Lemmon plays Howard Finnigan's father. It's a role filled with regret for past actions and lost opportunities.The structure of \"Short Cuts\" is not unlike Paul Anderson's later \"Magnolia\". Both have multiple, intersecting story lines. The similarities become more marked when towards the end of \"Short Cuts\", an earthquake intercedes as does the rain of frogs in Magnolia. However, the earthquake doesn't change the course of the characters lives or provide redemption. The film ends leaving the characters to deal with their lives as best they can.Altman couldn't always pull off a masterpiece as Pr\u00eat-\u00e0-Porter proved, but he came pretty close with this compelling movie.",

            "content": "Dear Mr. Altman, Short Cuts wasn't necessary. You'd already assured your place in cinematic history with a string of great films in the 1970s and some adventurous, stagy productions during the 1980s. You'd even staged a comeback of sorts with the bitingly funny The Player. You could have rested on your laurels. Instead, you made your most ambitious and rewarding film if not your greatest. I cannot tell you how many times I've promised myself I'd only watch half of it and then head to bed; I cannot tell you how many hours I've spent engrossed in the trials and tribulations faced by these various couplings and families over the course of a few days. Would I give any of those hours spent in the dark back? Never. Sincerely, Jason ForesteinShort Cuts is among my favorite Altman films (quite possibly my favorite) and among my favorite films of all time. It's three-plus hours unfold smoothly in an amazing display of editing and pacing. I've seen 80 minute movies that are interminable, yet I often want to start Short Cuts over as soon as it's finished. It's simply amazing on every level. First, and foremost, there's Altman's direction, which is at the top of its form here. Yes, The Player is a fantastic satire (and really really funny), but Short Cuts has the subdued cinematography and jazzy editing we've come to expect from an Altman film. It also, of course, has the requisite layered conversations. Like Nashville, Short Cuts is the definition of an ensemble piece, where no character takes precedence over any other. There are, I think, more than 20 characters integral to the stories in one form or another and Altman has the unimaginable ability to give them all enough space to come to life. You do not feel that there is a single two-dimensional character in the bunch; that's a major achievement. Then, you have amazing performances from the usual suspects (Time Robbins, Lily Tomlin, Jack Lemmon, and Robert Downey Jr.) as well as amazing performances from some soon-to-be household names (Lili Taylor, Frances McDormand, and Julianne Moore). This doesn't even count the wonderful turns from the criminally underrated Fred Ward, Tom Waits, Chris Penn, Peter Gallagher, and Matthew Modine. Huey Lewis even delivers a reputable performance. Like Gosford Park and Nashville, the ensemble is perfectly cast and they all perform above and beyond what is necessary. You expect a few duds (like, say, Robin Williams in Branagh's Hamlet); you don't expect perfect characterizations from everyone--especially when you have at least three musician- cum-actors. The writing is also superb. Sure, Altman was working from stories by Raymond Carver (who you all should go out and read immediately), but the tales were not told by Carver in such an inter-related fashion. He wrote short story collections not connected short story collections. Thematically, his tales resonated with one another, but there was not the crossing-over that takes place here. Altman and Barhydt do a simply amazing job translating those tales to the screen (they also do a commendable job translating from the Pacific Northwest to Los Angeles). Short Cuts is an ambitious film that, in the hands of a lesser director, would have likely lost its way. It's probably not perfect (is any film perfect?), but it comes as close to perfection as any film can. It's one of a kind and a film that has had its own effect on cinematic history (Magnolia and Crash crib, to a degree, from this film). It's a monumental achievement and beautiful and wonderful and I love it.",

            "content": "Nashville (1975) is canonically Altman's masterpiece. Nashville pioneered the use of 8 track sound that was key to bringing Altman's signature overlapping dialog to life. This coupled with the narrative open ended quality and Altman's fly on the wall direction (liberal use of zoom lenses and free flowing camera) cemented the film as THE Altman film. So it says something that I think a real argument can be made that Short Cuts should be considered Altman's masterpiece. I do not where I fall on the question but these two great films are pillars of America cinema.Whereas Nashville's exploration of Americana is bold, vivid and striking Short Cuts present its exploration of modernity's isolation and alienation in italics. The Carver stories proved a fruitful ground to plant Altman's sensibilities. The way the short stories are broke apart and integrated leaves each story precisely ambiguous enough to hit the correct note while yielding a cohesive, emotionally powerful whole. There is a soullessness to these characters that nonetheless have a humanity to them in the way they try to pass time-take short cuts-in the wrong way. I imagine that Carver fans might be displeased with the looseness of the adaptation but to me it is a perfect example of how source material can inspire. This is Altman's rift on the Carver material; it is very much like a jazz variant on a classic melody.Whereas Nashville was a leap forward in technique, Short Cuts is the work of a master who knows precisely how to paint a mosaic. The transitions between the various story threads are varied-some scenes are joined visually, some via dialog, some via concept-and the film's pace never legs as a result. Films like this often feel episodic and disjointed but Altman as writer reshapes the stories to fit together and as a director he knows how to shoot an end of scene to flow freely into the next. The editing is a masterclass of juxtaposition to add thematic weight and to keep the momentum of the narrative going.Nashville is angry and filled with acidic wit. There is some of that disillusionment in Short Cuts-how could there not be?-but much of the film is tempered by Altman's aged compassion. Like I said I can't say which film is better.Oh and *of course* the acting is wonderful. Lemmon is in the film for all of 10 minutes but turns in a show stopping scene. But that is the least of the performances.",

            "content": "Maverick director Robert Altman and acclaimed short story writer Raymond Carver prove to be perfectly matched in this, one of Altman's very best films.Altman takes a series of Carver stories, transplants them from the Pacific Northwest to Los Angeles, and interweaves them into one meandering (but in a good way) narrative about people trying to navigate the tricky waters of this thing called life. Like the Carver stories, there aren't profound realizations in this film, and there aren't tidy conclusions. Life for just about every character consists of nothing but lesser or greater disappointments, and if the film isn't very optimistic (o.k. let's be honest -- it's not optimistic at all), it's also very true to Carver's tone. I can see why people would be turned off by it, because it is awfully bleak, but I think it's a fascinating film, made so by Altman's fantastic direction and the sensational work of the entire ensemble cast.It's impossible and unnecessary to single any one actor out, since all of them are top notch and the movie is the sum of its parts. On my latest viewing, I found the film to be largely one big apology to women for the inadequacies of the men in their lives. It's one of the themes Altman frequently explored throughout his career, and it was most definitely one of Carver's biggest preoccupations, so it comes as no surprise that it's given one of its most ambitious treatments here.Grade: A+",

            "content": "Robert Altman's \"Short Cuts\" portrays the everyday lives of a number of Los Angeles residents over the course of several days. Based on nine short stories by Raymond Carver, the film is itself essentially a series of loosely knitted short films, each film rather slight on its own, but richly rewarding when taken as a whole.Some of the stories in particular are very fun. One, for example, finds actor Tim Robbins playing a hot tempered police officer constantly at war with the family dog. Another sees Robert Downey Jr playing a make up artist with a fondness for gore, Jennifer Jason Leigh playing a phone sex operator with a sexually repressed husband and Tom Waits playing a boozy limousine driver.Typical of Altman, \"Cuts\" sports a jazzy atmosphere, Altman's plot weaving in and out, his actors improvising, his story lethargically told. With several arguments, accidents, corpses and tales of infidelity, the film makes all the usual points about chance, fate, abandonment, love and loss, but upon closer inspection, there's some deeper stuff going on as well.For example, when one character returns home from a visit to the bakers (to buy a cake), she finds that her television has been left on. She turns the TV off but is then startled to find her son, Casey, sitting on the couch. The kid's just been hit by a car. This sequence is repeated later on when another woman gets out of the shower and likewise finds her television on. She's then startled to find her son, Chad, on the floor (eating cake). He's at home because he's been abandoned by his father. Two scenes, each with the following elements: cake, bakery, televisions, baby shower, a literal shower, mothers returning home and finding their sons.The positioning of both women and their gestures as they turn their TVs off only to find their sons (who shouldn't be home), are identical. These scenes are further linked by an angry Tim Robbins kicking out the family dog whilst his wife frets that her baby (the dog) might get hit by a car. The abandonment of the dog anticipates the abandonment of Chad. The threat of the dog being run over, anticipates the running over of Casey.But there's a further relationship between Chad and Casey. Chad's father, a respectable news reporter, was himself abandoned by his father as a child on his birthday. And Casey's father and Chad's father are further linked by the fact that one reports the other's news. Likewise, Doreen, the woman who hits Casey with her car, serves Chad in her bar the next day.Not only are the character's lives affected by coincidence and chance, but they represent one another in different circumstances. The film is a giant \"what if?\". Taken apart, the stories are relatively insignificant. It is only when we interact one scene with another, that meaning is found. It is this play of difference that makes \"Short Cuts\" so rich. Meaning is found only in relation and opposition to something else. But what's more, it's the audience's responsibility to make all the film's connections. To find the short cuts between one point and another.When Altman has a character played by Julianne Moore say \"I think they're about seeing and the responsibility that goes with it\" when speaking about her art, he's communicating directly to his audience. \"Short Cuts\" knows the world is simply too big to talk about. Too vast, limitless, filled with infinite possibilities and masses upon masses of intercontextual layers. The world is rife with association, movement, meetings upon meetings. Put the world under a microscope and \"Short Cuts\" is what you get. Seemingly random but ultimately not. At the same time, it is about all the associations that we miss in life. Upon first viewing, the stories are all disconnected and only superficially linked. It's our responsibility to see beyond the superficial.9/10 - Long before \"Short Cuts\", Altman's films anticipated the mosaic-like plots of similar films by the likes of Anderson, Sayles, Haggis, Kasdan etc. He's still the undisputed master of this sort of stuff, though.

            "content": "The title of Robert Altman's 1993 film Short Cuts is wholly ironic, here is a film nigh on three hours in length which doesn't necessarily 'cut' anything at all; indeed burrows into the lives of several people before showing mostly everything they get up to and what affects them. The film is a really engrossing drama centering on a number of disparate residents of Los Angeles round about the time of the film's production; a snapshot of warts-and-all living in amongst both the higher-ups and lower-downs of a city plagued by a heatwave; an insect infestation and, it would seem, the odd earthquake. Altman and his film take very few short cuts to anywhere at all, his film is just as interested in the catalysts of life that drive us to where we end up as it is the intricacies that unfold around these events with others we may already know. Take, for instance, a sequence early on involving a group of fishermen whom discover a dead body in the waters the're around; where another film may have picked up on that and run with it as a plot mechanism inciting causality, Short Cuts allows the men to take note of the situation before making a decision which allows the film to consequently revolve around something else other than a set premise. Short Cuts being of an ilk which will later explore how this decision they make comes to affect each of them and their relations with certain others. The film begins with a physical placing of the audience high above ground level, a flock of helicopters equipped with pesticide late at night gliding through the sky so as to eliminate a recent pest problem which is plaguing the area. Beginning so high up enables the first shot of the entire film to be one of an establishing variety, the following three or so hours coming to revolve around what feels like all of those within the vicinity of this locale and a sense of power or establishing of power which comes with the ability to access such private tales in these people's lives. The film goes on to flit from a pool cleaner named Jerry Kaiser, played by Chris Penn; to a limousine driver Tom Waits' Earl Piggot; to Robert Downey Jr.'s layabout Bill Bush whom takes a swig from a beer can during breakfast as well as a large proportion of others all mingling in and around what appears to be an individual block.To list every actor or actress and their role would be beside the point, needless to say, the film isn't so much preoccupied with the gimmick that their lives and existences should become entwined, as much as it is the thematics of each of their tales that are eerily similar to everyone else's; the overlying idea that regardless of age; gender; marital situation or class distinction: death, or loss, affects us all and the ingredient of deconstructing these characters' attitudes towards sex or love keeps the film on that so-called path seeing it explore the two things humankind is apparently so fascinated by - the thesis or pitch makes the film sound terribly self-important; it is, in actuality, anything but. Altman's bounding from person to person; from character to character; from family to family is enthralling, the staying with each bunch of characters for what feels like the minimal of time before heading onto the next port of call somehow manages to get across as much in the way of development and a feel for who these people successfully executed with the smallest of hassle in the shortest span of time possible.Altman produces amusing transitions which propel us from tale to tale, his ability as a director to link or build bridges between seemingly disparate sequences away from core thematics works wonderfully. A glass of milk sits idly on the side in a room, specifically for Ann Finnigan's (MacDowell) son Casey whom was hit by Doreen Piggot's (Tomlin) car but got up and merely walked home in shock; a cut later, we're on another class of milk in somebody else's house \u2013 that of the husband, Earl, whose wife it is that hit the child. The television in Earl's house speaks of accidents happening and that care ought to be taken; the-then leaping to the three fishermen and their continual ignoring, for now, of a dead body sees us effortlessly transit back into the city and young cellist Zoe (Singer) whom lies face down in a swimming pool in a state of mock-drowning. Where Zoe's tale comes to lead us, as she struggles to hold down a basic relationship with her mother Tess (Ross), sees these seeds that are planted of a very ominous kind. Tess is a singer, Zoe a musician and yet despite sharing that musical connection in their practical loves, are tragically unable to do so as a mother-daughter unit. The film is a really fine exploration of the bonds, however shaky, an array of people have with one another be they friendships, parental, marital or even a child's fondness for a dog another member of the family despises. Short Cuts is expertly acted; wonderfully directed by a man flitting between an array of varying people with different problems linked by a common thematic and remarkably paced for a film of its length \u2013 certainly worth seeing.",

Hmm... you'd think, wouldn't you?Short Cuts could have succeeded, if it had set for itself some less lofty goals.  It contained 22 main characters.  I don't care what kind of brilliant director you are, there is no way to provide adequate characterization for 22 main players in a 3 hour movie.  The end result is that I cared about none of them.  It also didn't help that most of the stories were really pretty boring.  A guy cheats on his wife.  A couple is going to have dinner at some other people's house.  Yet another couple babysit some fish.  Whee.  About 90 minutes into the story, things begin to get more interesting.  There's a dead body involved, and some characters actually show an emotion that isn't boredom.  By this point, though, I completely stopped caring.  And it doesn't help that, for every minute devoted to, say, the dead body plot line, another 5 minutes are devoted to something completely banal.  And as a final complaint, it's all just so random.  There are tie-ins between story lines, but there's no justification for most of them.  If Bob suddenly dines at the restaurant where Joe works, that's enough reason to devote an entire side-story to how Bob overcame his bowel problems.  And the Great Ending has no relevance whatsoever. Yaaaaawn.This movie had a few amusing moments, but \"a few amusing moments\" in a 3 hour movie just doesn't cut it.  Yeah, it parallels real life, but who wants to spend 3 hours watching their own life on the screen?  My life is boring enough; I don't need to have my entertainment be boring, too.

Really, what's Altman directed that was worth anything since Mash in 1972? He's one of those hack director's that Hollywood decided the biz should like and there's a few of those. All these talented actors flocked to do this movie just to say, \"I was in an Altman movie.\" I guess is looks good on a resume. This movie script was written by someone who doesn't have the talent to finish a whole script so they crazy glued 5 or more reject scripts together for a 3 hour crap fest and Hollywood sheeple call it art!!",

            "content": "In my opinion, \"Short Cuts\" is one of the most unwatchable films I have everseen. Altman took a series of Raymond Carver's most masterful stories (and one poem, I believe), made them into short films with some terrific actors, chopped each film into 30 second clips and threw them in a blender so they werecompletely out of sequence. Watching \"Short Cuts\" is very much like watchingTV with someone who will not stop channel surfing; the moment cohesionbegins to fuse the various scattered moments together, the film breaks themapart. The stories/chapters themselves would probably have been fine if theyhad been left as individual segments (to attempt a little cohesion betweenstories, some of Carver's separate characters were fused into one--Lily Tomlin who plays the wife in \"They're Not You're Husband\" is also the woman who hits the little boy with her car in \"A Small Good Thing\"--why Altman then chose to destroy narrative cohesion WITHIN the stories is beyond me), but with so much going on simultaneously, it's impossible to follow. Carver's writing motto was \"No tricks\"; in other words, he eschewed gimmicks and clever little devices and instead just wrote honest, sometimes brutally frank depictions of life as it is, warts and all. Altman's movie is one big gimmick, one long pointless trick. It's amazing to me that a movie combining several of my favorite things in the world- -Raymond Carver, Tom Waits, Lily Tomlin and a clown--could be so bad!Another IMDB user commented that the movie seemed more like a big party forthe actors then something the viewer can appreciate and this seems to me to be a very apt point.",

            "content": "This film, from director Robert Altman, shows us a few days in the intertwined lives of various Los Angeles residents. Some of the characters already know each other, some will get to know each other and others are merely destined to cross paths. We see snapshots into their various lives. A group of fishermen discover a body but decide not to report it straight away. A waitress hits a young boy in her car; he appears to be fine but is later rushed to hospital. A clown, married to one of the anglers, is invited to dinner at the home of an artist who is married to the doctor treating the boy. An adulterous policeman tries to get rid of the family dog and the ex-husband of the woman she is seeing decides to literally take half of what they own. These are just some of the stories and characters we meet along the way.'Short Cuts' isn't an easy film to describe as there isn't a conventional plot; the characters each have their own little story; some have obvious resolutions, others don't. The opening scenes tell us how the city is being sprayed to deal with a medfly infestation but that has almost no bearing on what we see. This might all sound rather confusing but actually when watching I found it made sense and the way the film skipped from one story to another kept me interested; it certainly didn't feel like I was watching a three hour film. The cast is packed with well-known actors; Julianne Moore, Jennifer Jason Leigh, Robert Downey Jnr, Madeleine Stowe, Tim Robbins, Francis McDormand and Chris Penn to name just a few; these and the others are on great form making their characters believable even during the more extreme moments. This certainly isn't for younger viewers or the easily offended; as well as such things as Jennifer Jason Leigh performing phone-sex while feeding her young children and Julianne Moore arguing with Matthew Modine while half naked there is a nihilistic feel at times with the fishermen's story and a murder in the closing scenes. If you believe a good film needs a strong plot then this probably won't be for you but if you want a film that is all about characters and how they interact then this is definitely one to watch.",

            "content": "Ensemble cast movies have been proved to be both great and terrible ideas. There are plenty examples of movies that represent both ends of the spectrum. Of this particular type of casting, the most familiar are movies that have intertwining story lines that overlay in some fashion. Initially the plot threads feel a bit out of place and non-related, but in due time they all end up crossing paths and lead to some kind of climax. This kind of execution isn't always the case, but it is more or less the one that is frequently used. Examples of nonlinear story telling would be like V/H/S (2012), V/H/S/2 (2013), V/H/S Viral (2014) and Movie 43 (2013). This is where the stories are fragmented and made into shorts instead of an actual feature length product. The movies that have a more interwoven storyline are works like Crash (2004) and Reach Me (2014). But it wasn't just the start of the 21rst century that screenwriters had come up with this concept. Back in 1993, avant-garde director Robert Altman decided to take a crack at it. The end result was this movie. Based on the writings by Raymond Carver (the same writer to that of Birdman (2014) was based off of) and adapted by Altman and another writer, this movie focuses on the lives of several couples living in Los Angeles. As simple as this sounds, these collaborative threads that make up the film are not very exciting. What truly works in favor for the viewer are the more technical elements. Cinematography by Walt Lloyd (The Santa Clause (1994)) is adequate. Several of Lloyd's shots contain accurate background scenery to L.A. and anything around that has clear lighting. The music composed by Mark Isham is easy going too. Isham as a composer who tends to create music that is more aesthetic than engaging, yet for this score it has all the cool jazz sounds using the double bass and other jazz instruments. It's almost like a precursor towards Christopher Lennertz style,\u0085almost. Lastly is the acting by all cast members. They can act and they do a great job at making the viewer feel the appropriate way for their roles. Sadly, the problem is their roles. This is where unfortunately so many things go wrong. The cast to this movie is enormous. You have Andie MacDowell, Bruce Davison, Jack Lemmon, Julianne Moore, Matthew Modine, Anne Archer, Fred Ward, Jennifer Jason Leigh, Chris Penn, Lili Taylor, Robert Downey Jr., Madeleine Stowe, Tim Robbins, Lily Tomlin, Tom Waits, Frances McDormand, Peter Gallagher, Annie Ross, Lori Singer, Lyle Lovett, Huey Lewis, Robert DoQui, the list goes on and only a couple of the characters this entire list play are sympathetic or likable to some degree. This is actually quite a frustrating watch. Almost no character has respect for anyone or anything. This is not to say that the characters were intentionally written to be mean spirited, but the attitudes portrayed just make the viewing experience feel entirely hateful.In some cases as well, the characters act very strange. Sometimes they don't care how foul their mouth is around other people. One character is a mother who makes a living by making phone-sex calls and she does this from while she takes care of her babies. That's just wrong. Another individual cheats on her husband and has no problem cursing him out in front of her son. How careless. Robert Altman as a director has been known to push boundaries but there are some points that even he should find questionable. It's understood that people in general take on different personalities during different times of the day and some activities diverge a lot further from others but some are just beyond uncomfortable. My question is, what is supposed to be taken away from this viewing? What is the message specifically? Life is what you make it? Life does not always end happily for everyone? What? The list of questions can go on and on because of how little clarity there is in the film's screenplay.The only credit that can be given to the writers is the connectivity they give each storyline. At some point or another each thread will cross one another and it's interesting to see who knows who. That's it though, not even all subplots are or feel properly concluded the right way. There's something going on in L.A. about some MEDfly and the air is being crop dusted and people think they'll get cancer; but that goes nowhere. With that, there is very little buildup to the climax of this three hour movie. Worse yet is that this movie is three hours long and couldn't develop its characters in some fashion to make them likable or at least make them realize how destructive they're behaviors are. Suzy Elmiger and Geraldine Peroni who work as the editors don't do a good job either. Some scenes pertaining to a certain thread last all of a quick 10-20 seconds long and it transitions to another. That's quicker than the editing in Reach Me (2014). It's unfortunate that it feels this poor.Aside from its acting, camera-work and music, nothing else is worth it here. Almost all characters are unlikable, of which most of their behaviors are uncomfortably strange and their development feels somewhat nonexistent. The script also suffers from unfinished subplots, annoying editing and a long running time.",

Also, I thought it was kinda pathetic Huey Lewis agreed to whip out \"lil' Huey\" on screen-- showed how far he'd fallen. These sentiments haven't changed, but 15 years later I can really appreciate the subtle social and human commentary as well as the fascinating weave of stories and characters Shortcuts has to offer. Easily Altman's masterpiece and some of the best work from many of the illustrious cast. This film stands pretty much alone--Only thing it really reminds me of is Maupin's 'Tales of the City'.

I expected Cats to be a musical, not a variety show, so when I found out that it was the latter, I was already 80% through the show, confused and strained. Short Cuts opens with something that looks like an introduction to a plot, and again I was lead astray.That said, I did find some of the stories fairly good. Some would, however work much better as short stories on paper, with a distinct ending so you are not looking for more of it when you are really into the next. So, instead of separate short stories, we get them connected, and that changes them, not always in a good way, but instead making the whole thing feel like a soap opera.My advise remains: Do not try to look for a storyline, because there isn't one. The movie is built from a bunch of separate stories, and it is up to you to decide where one ends and another starts. Knowing that, you might enjoy Short Cuts.",

Basically a fleet of helicopters spray for medflies, and along the path flight we meet various characters, most not aware of each other, only some that are, but all going through regular day to day things, but all have an element of luck and chance come into play and change things for them, whether based on infidelity or death. Dr. Ralph Wyman (Matthew Modine) is married to wife Marian Wyman (Julianne Moore), but she later admits she has been sleeping with another man, Marian's sister Sherri Shepard (Madeleine Stowe) is married to police officer Gene Shepard (Tim Robbins), he initially plans to leave the family and the irritating barking dog following his affair with Betty Weathers (Frances McDormand), but changes his mind for his children, and Betty herself is divorcing helicopter pilot Stormy Weathers (Peter Gallagher). Waitress Doreen Piggot (Lily Tomlin) is married to alcoholic limousine driver Earl (Tom Waits), she is shocked after hitting Casey Finnigan (Zane Cassidy) with her car, the day before his ninth birthday, the little boy seemed fine for some time, but then his mother Ann Finnigan (Andie MacDowell) finds him in a bad way and he is taken to hospital where he goes unconscious, and Casey shockingly dies all of the sudden, the baker gets a harsh explanation of why Ann or TV commentator husband Howard (Bruce Davison) didn't collect the birthday cake. Tess Trainer (Annie Ross) is a cabaret singer seen singing throughout the film, her daughter who lives with her is cello player Zoe (Lori Singer), she becomes overwhelmed by her mother's alcoholism and isolation, breaking down and committing suicide breathing gas fumes from inside her car, later being found dead by her mother, and Jerry Kaiser (Chris Penn) is a pool cleaner married to wife Lois (Jennifer Jason Leigh) who is a mother at home with children, and often taking care of them at the same time she makes money as a sex phone operator. Stuart Kane (Fred Ward), and his buddies Gordon Johnson (Buck Henry) and Vern Miller (Huey Lewis) are on a three day fishing trip, they find a woman's body in the river near the rocks, but initially considering it they do not report it to the police, they simply tie her to the rocks and continue fishing, and report the death after the trip, Stuart's wife Claire (Anne Archer) is angry that they did nothing all that time, and feeling guilty she attends the funeral of the dead twenty three year old girl. Other characters you see appearing in the film in amongst the other story lines and events include couple Honey Bush (Lili Taylor), Doreen's daughter, and makeup artist Bill Bush (Robert Downey Jr.) who spend most of their time entertaining each other at home, and Howard's father Paul Finnigan (Jack Lemmon) in the hospital who approaches some people being friendly or jokey, and the event that involves all characters is an earthquake in the area. All the stars in the film do their parts very well, whether being funny or serious, especially MacDowell, Robbins and Jason Leigh, obviously none of the stories are really related or connected, but you are compelled by a good number of them, when they are illicit, distressing or emotional, a most watchable and interesting ensemble, interweaving and multi layered drama.

It is hard to be sympathetic with any one character, because they are so flawed. Still, I think it is a good movie, not for the contrived stories, but for Altman's direction, and the editing that kept everything moving along at a brisk clip.

This film, however, makes the opposite mistake: the script is excessive, it has so many characters and so many interconnected sub-plots that it is almost necessary to make diagrams and schemes on a board to be able to follow what is happening. I got almost halfway through the movie and I didn't really know who was who.The film begins with a fleet of helicopters spraying something over the skies of Los Angeles. I, who was very young when the film was made, had to do some research to realize what they're doing: spraying an insecticide to fight flies, something I had never seen in the middle of a city. Then the film begins to introduce us to a multitude of characters and their everyday stories: we have several middle-class couples, each with the problems of their lives, we have a limousine driver married to a cafeteria worker, the pilot from one of the helicopters, an erotic line operator who has a husband and children... and we follow the daily problems of these couples and families. The film tries to give us a portrait of ordinary people and their lives, but it does so in an excessively dispassionate and uncompromising way, failing to convey the emotions of the characters, with whom we have no particular connection. The only sub-plot that tries to go through the most emotional way (that of the child) turns out to be so melodramatic that it loses credibility.Technically, this film is low-key and doesn't bet too much on anything flashy. The cinematography is the standard used at that time, the special effects and visuals work reasonably, but not surprisingly, the sets and costumes are regular. The editing work was well done, but the film, with its three hours long, becomes a little tiring, mainly due to our inability to truly connect with the characters and what we see in the film.What saves this film, in a decisive way, is the enormous cast of great actors, and the way in which each one, in a very individual way, does an excellent dramatic work. The film, in fact, looks like a showcase of the best Hollywood had in the early 90s. Bruce Davison, Fred Ward, Lily Tomlin, Tom Waits, Anne Archer, Andie MacDowell, Chris Penn, Robert Downey Jr., Lily Taylor, Madeleine Stowe, Tim Robbins, Jennifer Jason Leigh, Julianne Moore, Peter Gallagher, Matthew Modine, Frances McDormand... say a name, and he's there! Each one in their role, each one trying to do the best, but each one for themselves. The film works very well as a dramatic exercise and allows each actor to show the best that he knows how to do. Even so, it lacks emotion, lacks commitment, lacks intensity.",

Carver's stories are compact and carry an incredible emotional impact and honesty, Altman replaces the details from the originals with some c**p from his own, less fertile, less insightful imagination and somehow loses all of their impact in the process.It was a treat seeing Annie Ross, but still, just thinking about this movie makes me angry.

            "content": "The typeface of its opening credits may look unprepossessing to today's eyes, but Robert Altman's portmanteau Los Angeles satire, inspired by Raymond Carver's short stories, retains its abiding allure by presenting a social microcosm weaving through 22 principle characters, among them are eight white heterosexual couples (Altman is Hollywood's old guard, so diversity and inclusivity are apparently not his forte), one pair is from a prior generation and the rest are 30/40-somethings married/divorced with or without kids, plus an addition of a dysfunctional mother-daughter relationship.Normalcy on the placid surface is disrupted in the opening sequence where helicopters are crop-dusting over an outlandish medfly quarantine area where our protagonists live, and is further overturned by coursing undertows where streams of (mostly negative) sentiments (displeasure, discomfort, jealousy, contempt, neurosis, paranoia, miscommunication, miscomprehension, ill feeling, among others) are simmering, festering and transmuting into accidents, betrayal, suicide, murder, bereavement but also fence-mending and merriment, as life it is.Naturally, our most worrisome concern is the safety of Howard and Ann Finnigan's son, who is hit by a car driven by waitress Doreen Piggot (Tomlin), after ostensibly looking fine and refusing Doreen's request to take him to his parents, he soon falls to a portentous coma in the hospital, which puts Ann (MacDowell) and Howard (Davison), a famous TV commentator through an excruciating wringer, aggravated by the incessant crank calls from a grievance-driven baker Mr. Bitkower (Lovett) and the unbidden visit of Howard's estranged father Paul (Lemmon).The doctor who treats the boy in the hospital is Ralph Wyman (Modine), whose wife Marian (Moore) is a painter, they live in a posh residence on the hill with a panoptic view of the area, but Ralph is bedeviled by a persisting idea that Marian has cheated on him. During a cello concert of Zoe Trainer (Singer), they meet another couple Claire and Stuart Kane (Archer and Ward), and offhand decide to invite them for a home barbecue, although Ralph regrets it in afterthought as the Kanes seem to be beneath his middle-class yardstick. In fact, Claire earns her living as a clown and Stuart is currently unemployed, who embarks on a three-day fish trip with his buddies and promises to bring back some spoils for the barbecue, but an accidental if morbid discovery during his jaunt will later cast a shadow over their relationship, a quintessential dichotomy between blokeish inconsideration and feminine sensibility. Marian's sister Sherri Shepard (Stowe) is unhappily married to a patrol cop Gene (Robbins), who fools around with a divorc\u00e9e of easy virtue, Betty Weathers (McDormand), and takes out his frustration and irritation on their family dog, who keeps yapping at him, meanwhile, Betty's ex-husband Stormy Weathers (Gallagher), what a killer name for a helicopter pilot, keeps tabs on her and exacts his revenge plan when Betty is out of town with another hubby prospect.\n \nOblivious of the accident's grave consequence, Doreen eventually reconciles with her old soak husband Earl (Waits) with a renewed feeling of dodging a bullet. Her daughter Honey (Taylor), is married to a make-up artist Bill Bush (Downey Jr.), the Bushes' best friends are the Kaisers, Jerry (Penn) takes odd jobs and Lois (Leigh), is a skilled phone sex operator who can ambidextrously eroticizing her patron and handling her tot at the same time, their seemingly unflappable equilibrium is betrayed with an unheralded violent act which is concurrently with a seismic disruption near the end, a shudder to accentuate the sense of being alive and kicking, which separates Zoe from her mother Tess (Jazz chanteuse Ross), a cabaret singer and single mother who is too jaded to connect with her unstable daughter. Ultimately, Altman is a superlative orchestrator of balancing act in conjuring up a kaleidoscopic cross section of a contemporary malaise that scourges the earth, partly owing to editor Geraldine Peroni's nonpareil adroitness (who is nominated for an Oscar in Altman's THE PLAYER 1992), every subplot is threaded with precision altogether and every cause-and-effect is divulged with limpid yet eloquent connotation, all on a string of the quirk of fate. What an ensemble piece! SHORT CUTS is Venice's Golden Lion winner, an honor shared with Krzysztof Kieslowski's THREE COLORS: BLUE (1993), and the ensemble cast is f\u00eated with both a Volpi Cup and later a special Golden Globe. But the cherrypick must be Julianne Moore's eye-popping derring-do, hardly any Hollywood actress can holds court with her explosion in such a distracting state without leaving a scintilla of self-consciousness, yes, under an intimate context, it is nothing if not verifiable. Second in line are MacDowell's poignant grief, Leigh's cavalier lassitude just moments after her feigned lasciviousness and Stowe's subtle archness cheek by jowl with her smoldering ire. Among the boy's club, Lemmon has one's sentimental vote as a loquacious self-defender whose self-centred righteousness is wrong-footed by a dire emergency and Penn ekes out a tangy danger of sexual suppression itching towards a boiling point before he finally snaps, but immediately saved by an earthquake, is that Altmanesque or Carverian?",

            "review_title": "Altman shows life in the LA of the '90s",
            "content": "Short Cuts is a film made up of several narrative threads, each of which features its own cast of characters that only briefly (or never) interacts with the characters in the other narrative threads. This style of filmmaking had first become popular in the 1970s with Nashville, another film from director Robert Altman. The different narratives are spliced together so that they keep close together chronologically, no small feat even given that every event depicted in the film takes place in Los Angeles over the course of the same two or three days and culminates with the same event.A work like Short Cuts isn't meant to convey a traditional plot with a beginning, middle, and end; rather, it's meant to offer a glimpse into the lives of several characters from various walks of life. Thus it's very important that the characters are set up quickly and efficiently. Altman sometimes succeeds in creating interesting, three dimensional characters with this model but other times the characters are just flat vessels for the acts they perform. It doesn't help that they perform all sorts of acts and that enough of these are morally questionable to make it quite difficult to take an instant liking to the characters; at the same time only one or two of these characters trigger strong negative reactions.This type of film can also be used to make a statement about the entire culture in which it takes place. Fortunately, Altman doesn't beat the viewer over the head with any obvious messages the way some of his imitators have over the last decade or so (I'm thinking of Paul Haggis here) but there are certainly some themes that pop up more than once. For example, sexuality is often seen as a commodity in the film. This is most obvious with a housewife who runs a lucrative phone sex business while taking care of her young children but can also be seen in the short skirts worn by a waitress and the artist who prefers to paint nude subjects. Another theme that frequently pops up is isolation. One of the most compelling performances in the film is given by Lyle Lovett whose over worked baker apparently has nothing better to do than make prank phone calls to his customers after hours. Another character is so unhappy with her life that she pretends to commit suicide and even intentionally injures herself; all of her feeble attempts to make connections with her emotionally dead mother result in further pain.The most pervasive theme in the film is the self interestedness of the characters. Practically every character in the film lies to his or her significant other as a matter of course; these are mostly characters who don't care about anyone beyond their immediate usefulness. The most striking example of this is the three fishermen who hike to a nice fishing spot and find a corpse floating there. Rather than report this death immediately, they choose to fulfill their original plan of drinking and fishing and save the corpse problem for the morning. Of course, they have no idea where the dead girl came from or how she got there so even they are unaware of how important the information of her death may be to others.In spite of all the negative aspects of the characters in Short Cuts, there are times when positive aspects shine through. Altman's film is certainly bleak but it isn't altogether hopeless: even the most grief stricken characters in the film eventually find someone who reaches out to them in their time of grief. Thus we see a little bit of hope amongst all the unhappiness and avarice.Technically, Short Cuts has all of the competence you would expect from an experienced veteran like Altman. His directing style is confident and effective but lacks anything as virtuoso as the opening tracking shot in his previous film The Player. The most impressive technical aspect is the acting: Altman has a large cast full of familiar faces and virtually everyone gives a great performance. While some of the story lines don't really go anywhere Short Cuts gets it right often enough to make it worth a watch for everyone.",

            "content": "The opening scene of this film- helicopters flying over LA spraying for Medfly- immediately brought to mind the openings from two of my favorite movies: \"La Dolce Vita\" and \"Apocalypse Now\". \"La Dolce Vita\" opens with a helicopter carrying a statue of Jesus over Rome, as if God himself were surveying the hedonistic landscape below in disgust. \"Apocalypse Now\" opens with helicopters sweeping over the Vietnam jungle and dropping tons of napalm, completely obliterating anything that once lived there. By the end of Robert Altman's \"Short Cuts\", I was pretty convinced napalming LA wouldn't be the worst thing to happen to the world. In fact, a total destruction of LA might feel akin to God's decision to wipe Sodom and Gomorrah from the map. LA in this film is a cold, heartless, loveless, tragic place; it's also wonderfully developed, beautifully acted, and meticulously crafted. This is a story that sort of defies any sort of plot summary; it's just an anthology film about a few interconnecting stories of modern people being casually cruel to one another. While this film is listed on IMDb as a comedy, don't go into this move expecting happiness unless you can laugh at the tragi-comedic ironies that continually pop up.As much of the fun of this story comes from figuring out how each of the stories relate to each other, I won't discuss much of the connections between characters, but I will address the themes, directing, and overall story. This is one heck of a movie; it's probably the most ambitious project I've seen from Altman, and though it's not my favorite of his films (\"McCabe & Mrs. Miller\" is one of my all-time favorites), it is certainly a movie worth watching several times. In terms of anthology films set in LA (I can't believe that's a subgenre of film now) this is below the bar set by \"Pulp Fiction\", but it blows \"Crash (2005)\" waaaaaay out of the water.For our full review of Short Cuts visit and hundreds of other reviews, articles, and podcast episodes visit us at True Myth Media!",

            "content": "Another impressive Robert Altman ensemble piece, for the most part. Short Cuts brings us a look into the lives of an extensive number of Los Angeles residents, interconnecting in sometimes loose and sometimes more direct ways. We see doctors, singers, mothers, waitresses and plenty more, all done in the fluid and rhythmic fashion that one would expect from the man who brought us Nashville. Short Cuts feels very much like an L.A. film; there's a controlled chaos to it all that feels frenzied but in a strange way that lets you know that Altman is still behind the wheel.Over the course of the film we delve further into the lives of each individual, focusing on a few and exploring them deeper through Altman's heavy themes of morality and mortality (the film is based on a collection of short stories by Raymond Carver). It's a film that if it hits you right could get you doing a lot of self-reflecting on life and death, which is always a powerful thing to resonate within an audience. The most surprising thing about the film for me was how quickly it went by. Coming in at a running time of over 180 minutes, I was always quite intimidated by it and was expecting at least part of it to drag no matter how good the overall product was, but it flew by.Altman has this indescribable way to pace these epic ensemble pieces that make them feel so fluid and complete, keeping the focus on each character just long enough to unfold another layer but moving on to the next before it starts to drag. It's really one of the more impressive things about his capabilities as a director, how magnificently paced they are. For the majority of Short Cuts I was very impressed with everything that he was able to draw out of his cast; the emotions felt so genuine and, as he did in Nashville, the performances were mostly authentic and deeply lived-in.I don't think that it mixes the comedic and dramatic elements as well as it could have, but there was an understated quality to the dark themes that made it feel a lot more natural than if he had poured on the melodrama thick, which he easily could have given the material. Here he works with more established names than he did in something like Nashville, but there was a real lack of vanity from the actors, none of them allowing their prominence to overshadow anything else about the rest of the ensemble. Altman brings all of these characters together in a way that feels alive but not overly cinematic, expertly staged and paced...for the majority of it.There's a scene where Julianne Moore and Matthew Modine's characters get into an argument over a possible infidelity of hers, and it's around this scene that the film takes a bizarre turn for the worse. The performances that used to feel so genuine were all of a sudden desperately forced, the understated emotions that were allowed to build were now coming to the surface and were so melodramatic and shoved down the throat of the audience. It was as if Altman and the cast took everything that was working so well about it beforehand and decided to do everything in the completely opposite fashion for the final stretch. I struggle to think of a film that took such a dramatic shift, especially so late in it's game.By the time we reach the heavy-handed climax to bring together the universality of the characters, I wanted to scream at how desperate it all had become. It felt as though Altman had stepped down from his chair and let someone much less skilled than he come in and try to finish it, but they just hacked it to pieces. Short Cuts is a very good film for 150 minutes that is almost derailed by it's final 30.",

Things happen, people make wrong choices, there are regrets and recriminations, and after all that, life goes on.

In seemingly independent stories told in parallel, some characters cross paths, sometimes just peripherally, sometimes with tremendous dramatic impact. But these meetings are coincidental and unpredictable. The viewer has the big picture while the characters grope along with their snippets of information.And the characters are such a mixed bag. Surgeon, white trash, policeman, classical musician, baker, and on and on. What they have in common is the fabled vapid rootlessness of LA. The lack of human connection, the broken moral compass, the self centeredness; the qualities that can make the most minor problem seem insurmountable. Mr. Altman delivers it all up with a directorial and storytelling skill that is unmatched by most of his peers.

They aren't pretty, but they're not low-lifes, either. They inhabit a moral universe. You won't find among them any sadistic ex-husbands or artists who walk around naked from the waist down.

I had been referred back to them after I had fallen in love with PTA's Magnolia (\"You won't even think Magnolia is good after you see how much PTA ripped-off from Altman,\" I was told). Nashville was perfect. I haven't seen more than a few movies that are better than it. I think it is the perfect picture of America. But as for Short Cuts, it felt to me like Altman had run out of ideas and had to revert to the structure of his best film. Altman had been labeled a box office dud in the 80s, and The Player gained him a bit of success. But when he had to repeat The Player's success, I think he must have felt cornered.I did like Short Cuts on a much smaller level than I did Nashville (and Magnolia, too). Some of the stories are interesting and successful. But it has two major problems: in the acting field, Lyle Lovett and Andie MacDowell, who must be the worst actress who ever set foot in the business, don't pull their weight. The story line concerning the boy who was hit by the car should have been the most powerful piece of the film. Obviously Altman thought of it as the centerpiece. Because of those two actors, it is almost laughably terrible. And the twist on that story near the end, where MacDowell and her husband go to the bakery, seems completely ludicrous. Jack Lemmon tries desperately to spark an interest in this segment, but he is only a side character, and never has a chance to save it. The second problem is the complete lack of a conclusion and a resolution. An earthquake, then FIN! What? I felt so unsatisfied. A three hour movie should not end that arbitrarily. The political rally for Hal Phillip Walker was a godly ending scene. And the epilogue to Magnolia was also brilliant. The disaster in that film actually meant something.I give this film a 7/10, although I should probably give it a 6/10. To wait three hours for no resolution whatsoever is almost painful.",

I can't recall if I read the Raymond Carver novel, Short Cuts before or after seeing the movie, but the movie gives the book (with due respect to Raymond Carver) that Altmanesque edge and cynicism that goes with pretty much most Altman movies.Seeing how the stories are inter-connected is fun, and there's a galaxy of stars that give this movie much life. I also enjoyed the accompanying documentary which featured painted portraits of the main stars.Definitely worth seeing.",

It would be useless to try to touch on all of the different plot threads so I'll just say that they deal with life, love, lies & loss (among other things).The cast is fully stocked with talented individuals like Julianne Moore, Frances McDormand, Tim Robbins, Jack Lemmon, Robert Downey Jr, and the list goes on. As you can tell, the acting is in very good hands.As is the direction, which was expertly handled by Robert Altman. It's remarkable how he was able to link ten stories together and have it come off as successfully as it did. The film even tops the three hour mark and doesn't drag at all. The only thing that I wasn't completely satisfied with from a technical standpoint was the score/soundtrack, which wasn't 100% to my tastes.The stories themselves are interesting and varied, though some share common themes. It's mainly just an exploration of the multitudinous facets of life. I highly recommend seeing it for yourself, both for the great performances and the entertaining stories.",

            "content": "Altman, as many have written, had a career that is pretty much evenly divided between hit and miss. While I have always enjoyed his films, to be totally honest and fair, not all of his work qualifies to the magnificent high standard of being Altmanesque.Altman loved jazz, and the best of his best work move like a brilliant jazz performance. To move along with his groove, to truly become part of the experience requires a certain presence of mind. Like the greatest jazz artists, there are those who enter into deep debates over which work is best: is Kind Of Blue better than Bitches Brew? More important? In the end, it does come down to taste and preference, and this would be my second favorite Altman film after the sheer perfection of Nashville. The films are like watching someone make a quilt, \"bit by bit, putting it together\" (as Sondheim said), with no one particular thread being more important than another, just a simple, glorious collection of threads pulling together to form one majestic piece.The perception that his films are \"scattered\" or \"confusing\" or \"dull\" because of that missing story line is, sadly, understandable: we are being fed a constant stream of Single Story at every turn, being easier to market and exploit. Altman, at his best, had no need of a single narrative line and on those occasions in which there is no semblance whatsoever of a single story arc AND he is moving at his best, he creates films quite unlike any other by any one.Both this and Nashville are invitations, seductive in their own way: there is no fourth wall in these works, while we watch them, it is as if they are watching us.",

            "review_title": "Life in Los Angeles - Robert Altman's finest moment in film",
            "content": "Short Cuts (1993)4/4WARNING: MAJOR SPOILERS AHEADIt always seems to me that Los Angeles is a city of intrigue, mystery and ideas. I feel it's like a character in some of the movies it's featured in. If Los Angeles was a movie itself, I feel there would be no greater compliment than Robert Altman's \"Short Cuts\" to describe it. Here is a movie that combines and intertwines comedy, drama and tragedy. It is a movie that no one but Robert Altman would attempt, and only Altman would get it right. It is also one of the best directed and most entertaining movies I have seen all year, maybe ever.To really examine the masterpiece that is this film, one must start from the beginning. The film opens on a fleet of helicopters in LA, spraying across the city for medflies, which reveal all of its characters along its flightpath. I have counted 22 different characters.We first meet Dr. Ralph Wyman (Matthew Modine) and his wife Marian (Julianne Moore) at a cello concert for Zoe Trainer (Lori Singer), where they meet another couple, Stuart (Fred Ward) and Claire Kane (Anne Archer). Marian's own sister is Sherri (Madeleine Stowe) and she is married to a moronic, unhappy policeman, Gene (Tim Robbins), who makes up ridiculous and unbelievable stories about busting kids for crack to hide his affair with Betty (Frances McDormand). Betty is also unhappy with her husband, Stormy (Peter Gallagher) and is divorcing him and planning to take their kid with her. Doreen, a diner waitress, (Lily Tomlin) is married to an alcoholic and unreliable limo driver, Earl Piggot (Tom Waits). Howard Finnigan (Bruce Davison) lives with Ann (Andie McDowell) and his son Casey (Zane Cassidy) and they live next door to lounge and jazz club singer Tess Trainer (Annie Ross) and her daughter Zoe, the girl who plays the cello. They have a pool cleaner named Jerry (Chris Penn) who's married to Lois (Jennifer Jason Leigh) who works at home running an adult phone line while she tends to their own children. Jerry and Lois happen to know Doreen's daughter, Honey (Lily Tomlin) and her husband, Bill (Robert Downey Jr.), a successful make-up artist, and are good friends with her.To meet some other characters and lay out my favorite scenes, I'll fill you in.Right before Casey Finnigan's 9th birthday, Doreen hits him with her car by accident. He runs home, and doesn't go to school. After Ann finds him slouched on the couch after she has just returned from ordering his 9th birthday cake, he's barely able to talk, and Howard convinces Ann to take him to the hospital. When Casey is in the hospital, the baker, Andy (Lyle Lovett) calls multiple times to complain to Ann and Howard about how they've forgotten to pick up their birthday cake. The baker ends up harassing and not letting go of them hanging up the phone on him, and manages to spook Ann and Howard. Also while Casey is in the hospital, Paul Finnigan (Jack Lemmon), Howard's father who he hasn't seen in over 25 years after a vicious divorce, shows up in the hospital to meet Casey, who he doesn't know, while he's recovering from the accident. Paul is unable to spend much time with Casey anyway, though, and ends up talking with Howard with just the two of them, and not really knowing much about anything, he ends up talking mostly about himself, unsure of what else there is, and bringing up a similar accident that Howard had almost 30 years ago. Eventually, Casey's eyes begin to flutter open, but then they begin to close after the doctors and nurses aren't able to save him. Paul, seeing the disparity in the air and not knowing what to do, watches as both Casey's and his life begins to crumble, where he puts on his hat and walks down the hallway by himself, depressed.Stuart and his fishing trip friends, Gordon Johnson (Buck Henry) and Vern Miller (Huey Lewis), while getting a bite to eat before heading out on their big fishing trip, harass Doreen, and are generally rude to her. On the first day of their trip, they accidentally uncover a woman's dead body and are unsure of what to do with it, so they leave her there tied to the rocks, and when their own trip is over, report it. When Stuart tells Claire that they only reported it when they got back, she's disgusted, and after finding out that it was a 24 year old girl, she attends the funeral guilt ridden and disgusted that something like that could happen.So I don't spoil everything, I'll stop right there. Those are all the characters in the film, and how we meet and interact with them. I'd say that it summarizes the film, with a little more in there. To create something this layered and complex, to make something this ambitious work is a stroke of genius. My personal favorite scene in the entire movie is when Casey dies, and the disparity of the room can be felt as Paul, this lonely, sad man, walks down the hall with his hat on to leave. This is one of the best orchestrated scenes I have ever seen. It is heartbreaking to meet this man; a lone, depressed, and it seems unhappy single man whose wife left him over 25 years ago because his sister in-law seduced him and then, not knowing anything about Casey, showing up to try to check in with people he now barely knows, and becoming crushed and crumbled when he finally passes on. This is the work of a master, and one of the great filmmakers of a generation. It is that scene that will probably stay with me the longest; it's singularly heartbreaking, but also, so beautifully done that it out ranks most movie scenes of all time.Robert Altman's vision of all these stories intertwined together is so rich and spectacular that we sit, not knowing what's next, excited and enthralled, compelled and fascinated, by what will happen next. After the good \"The Player\" a year earlier, Altman was back in Hollywood and back in business after a serious of hideous flops and serious miscalculations in the mid to late 80's, he became a relatively quiet and forgotten filmmaker, known only for his great \"Nashville\" almost a decade earlier. \"The Player\" returned him back to form, and \"Short Cuts\" cemented his status as one of the leading filmmakers of all time. It's a mighty rise, I must say.One final note. \"Short Cuts,\" I think, is the definitive Robert Altman film, a movie that represents everything he's known for, and even praised for.",

It was perhaps the worst movie I have ever seen in a theatre. The reason being that none of it came together or made sense...even in the end. To sit and watch a movie for 3 hours and not have it come together or even arrive at a conclusion is the worst part. I walked out feeling like I just wasted 3 hours of my life and 7.00 of my money. I wanted to see Magnolia because I enjoy stories that intersect and come together (\"Twenty Bucks\", for example) and that's what I expected. What a shock! After seeing Magnolia, I heard of another movie with the same kind of theme to it and that movie is \"Short Cuts\". I rented it, watched it, and found it to be not only 100 times better than Magnolia but also an excellent and very entertaining movie as well. Short Cuts is 3 hours long, just like Magnolia. Short Cuts is about different stories that take place during a period of 48 hours in Los Angeles, kind of like Magnolia. Magnolia focuses on weather, Short Cuts focuses on a medfly epidemic. There are many characters whose lives change the lives of others around them and they occasionally intersect with one another, kind of like Magnolia. Only here are the better reasons why to see Short Cuts and completely avoid Magnolia:1.) Better Stories; More Characters that are actually Interesting. - Short Cuts has 22 main characters (WOW!) who are involved in about 10 different stories. The characters include the following: A lounge singer, a violinist, a television newscaster, a 7 year old boy, an estranged grandfather, a doctor, an artist, a cop, a helicopter pilot, 3 fishermen, a party clown, a chauffeur, a waitress, a dead body, a pool cleaner, a make-up artist, a baker, and a phone sex operator.....and it all makes sense in the end.2.) Better Finale: Short Cuts has an earthquake...Magnolia has bullfrogs falling from the sky...Enough said. The movie goes by so fast because we are enjoying each and every story because they all have a certain purpose and, believe it or not, you can connect each of the 22 characters together with at least someone else. You don't have to wait until the end for it to make sense, like some movies I know that say it will but don't live up to their promise. In the end, you can bet your life that it all comes together and forms a very acceptable conclusion. The prologue of Magnolia belongs at the beginning of Short Cuts and Magnolia, aside from it's prologue, belongs in the garbage.",

            "content": "Robert Altman's \"Short Cuts\" is a daring cinematic experiment, telling the stories of a number of characters who randomly connect and interact with each other across the urban sprawl of Los Angeles.Altman's characters reflect the vacuous, self-absorbed background of the city and class they are apart of. A few of them are actually quite likable, including Anne Archer's clown and Lori Singer's depressed violinist, but by-and-large they are selfish creatures, quite often nastily so. Tim Robbin's two-timing cop, Peter Gallagher's bitter divorc\u00e9e (who thinks nothing of tearing his ex-wife's living room to shreds with a chainsaw) and Annie Ross's past-her-best lounge singer fill the screen with scorn and bile that is volatile and believable.The script could have thrown in perhaps a touch more lightness to go along with the character's morbid darkness. Occasionally all the inward misery on show becomes tiresome and unwatchable. Inevitably some of the plot threads are more watchable than others and the way Altman switches back and forth between them is occasionally disorienting.The acting is top-notch as you would expect from a cast of this calibre but of particular note is Fred Ward's gung-ho fisherman, and Jack Lemmon has a great scene confessing to his son (Bruce Davidson) about the time he cheated on his mother. Lemmon is very good at balancing charm and unpleasantness in his later roles (see also \"Glengarry Glen Ross\").I don't think it's the 'great film' or masterpiece it has been made out to be, but was still an interesting watch nevertheless.",

The story isn't that predictable. Good mix of drama and bizarre comedy, even if some of the eccentric characters are a bit too way off. Liked the fishing trip. The only problem is you don't get enough development of the characters because there isn't enough time. Maybe a few less would have been better. The best part of watching this movie in 2013 is to see the terrific cast and how they have all gone on to so much in their careers. Also a bit poignant how some of them have aged in the 20 years since. Good to see Jack Lemmon in one of his later roles. Madeleine Stowe is lovely.

Simply stated, it's a waste of good acting that left us with a disturbing impression of \"Why bother?\". Several of the characters are interesting. Most are not. A brilliant portrayal of an uninteresting character is, in the end, uninteresting; so is watching a potentially interesting person do and say uninteresting things. Why bother? This movie follows the same general approach as many modern TV dramas, with several parallel, slightly intersecting story lines. One IMDb reviewer writes: \"...(Altman) weaves all these disconnected scenes together like common strands of rope.\" (As crudely as the film is edited, however, I think a plate of linguine would be a better simile)Another writes: \"the ending doesn't disappoint,\" (er... My impression is that they couldn't figure out HOW to \"end\" the various story(?) lines, so they just chopped off a few of them at the ankles, leaving the rest unresolved. The various resolutions were not only disappointing, but manipulative, and just-plain ludicrous in some respects. Although Altman tries to build to an earth-shaking conclusion, the movie just senselessly fades away. \"...a rare gem: A Hollywood movie of artistic enormity.\". Yes... well.... My dictionary says that enormity means 'the quality of passing all moral bounds; excessive wickedness or outrageousness.' While this accurately describes the film in some respects, I doubt if this is what the reviewer intended. In fact, the artistry is banal, perhaps best enjoyed by those who believe the word \"enormity\" refers to size. I tend to agree with the comments of those who gave it one or two stars.

A great admirer of jazz, you could say that Short Cuts is Altman's Kind of Blue. It is seminal, familiar, unpredictable, sad and, most of all, so accurate in it's portrayal of how we act in every possible situation you could think of. I don't think I'll ever forget Andie McDowell responding to Lyle Lovett about her son's death, or how Buck Henry took pictures of the dead girl floating in the stream, or how Fred Ward wouldn't bring the body back, but made sure to bring back the fish.

            "content": "Short Cuts for me was a surprisingly entertaining, if engrossing watch, really surpassing my expectations, due to the interplay of stories and characters. The scenario with the little boy, knocked over by trashy ex alcho-waitress, Tomlin, (check out her loser husband) in the hospital, clinging for life, is what had me, but it's the other stories too. Though there's comparisons to this and Magnolia, both films, starring Julianne Moore, the characters and occupations are more offbeat, and therefore much more interesting and exciting. There are so many wonderful actors in this film, I'd be forever writing them down, probably Penn, in still a good performance, was the lesser acting strength, as a birdwatching pool man, who's wife (Jennifer Jsson Leigh) is a blatant sex phone worker. Altman through his story, seems like he's let the actors kind of rabble on with their own scenes, ala Mike Leigh, kind of, some conversations are all so realistic, if documentary. The end, particularly, mirrors Magnolia, with another tremulous event, containing one shocking moment on Penn's behalf. Honestly I just love this movie, for what it gave me. It's the characters and their lives. Robbins, as well as being a low piece of s..t, involved in dognapping, for instance, is a real idiot for having an affair with Mcdormand, while he's got sexy Revenge star, Madeline Stowe. Another shocking aspect to the film, involves some dirty fisherman/camping, who partake in filming a dead nude female's body, found floating in a stream, and not reporting it. It sometimes is the dark side of characters to adds to the great movie's appeal. One funny aspect has Mcdormand's wife, Peter Gallagher, avidly and methodically, turning her ex's loungeroom, into one of ruin, a much loved retribution hitting big here. Here'a a great 90's movie, we breeze easy through it's over three hour running time, one minute than Magnolia, in fact.",

While Modine and Moore avoid an unmentionable issue that is chipping away at their marriage, Ward goes on a fishing trip with his buddies, an enjoyably experimental crumb of casting hilarious comedy writer Buck Henry and 1980s rock icon Huey Lewis together, and they discover a dead body in the water.In the meantime, a waitress, played by Lily Tomlin with her usual dry/assertive feminine toughness, accidentally hits young boy with her car. When the kid runs away from the accident, she imagines he is all right, but never learns the true consequences, or the harassment his parents, Bruce Davison and Andie MacDowell, must face from the overextended vindictiveness of the local baker, Lyle Lovett turning in one of the least striking performances of the film, who is fuming because the kid's ordered birthday cake was never collected. Davison's father, Jack Lemmon delivering on a painfully pathetic note, drops by the hospital after a twenty-year desertion and recounts the story of his unfaithfulness to Davison's mother. MacDowell's daughter, Lili Taylor, is married to Robert Downey, Jr., who unfortunately doesn't get the screen time demanded by his infinitely entertaining and charming presence. His character is a man aroused by sadism. Their party buddies, the inescapably sexy Jennifer Jason Leigh and very good Chris Penn, tip-toe around repressed tension in their marriage, as Leigh earns her living as a phone-sex operator, leaving Penn with a wife whose approach to sex is left indifferent.Tim Robbins, in a fantastically entertaining performance, is a completely unlikable cop who cheats on his wife, untouchably beautiful Madeleine Stowe, oblivious to the fact that she's known his secret for a long time and laughs indifferently about it behind his back. Robbins's mistress is realtor Frances McDormand, and Stowe's confidante is her sister, Julianne Moore.Anyway, these strands are woven together with musical passages by a sad cellist and her sourly cynical jazz-singing mother, Davison and MacDowell's neighbors. Everything culminates in a fashion very much to the same effect as the ending of Magnolia, which its writer-director Paul Thomas Anderson camouflages in surreal Biblical reference.Did Magnolia mirror everything in this film from the unknowingly interlocking ensemble format to the mysterious event preparing itself for a violent, cathartic effect on said ensemble, bringing it together? Yes. Very clearly. Especially since Anderson was the late Altman's fallback director on A Prairie Home Companion, showing an obvious affiliation and admiration between them. However, is Magnolia more emotionally piercing, powerful, and consequential than Short Cuts? Yes, it is. Short Cuts is directed with a steady vision and imagination in combining several different Raymond Carver short stories into a single picture that expresses something entirely its own, and was definitely fun to write and direct, but its immediate giving to the audience is a tad dehydrated.It's not fair, however, to view a movie particularly in the subjective comparison to its unauthorized doppelganger. Independently, Short Cuts is in essence a portrait of how small communities are, no matter how large they are. It is indifferent about the coincidences in the capsule of the lives of the endless stream of characters, which though it's in no way brief to us is coverage of a brief amount of time.",

It just never quite has the depth, or power or overall vision of it's earlier multi-character epic cousin, 'Nashville'.That said, most critics and people seem to like it even more than me, and it's well worth seeing and deciding for yourself. I bought the Criterion DVD, and still like it enough to return to every few years, whatever it's weak spots.",

I was looking forward to something possibly better than my beloved Magnolia.. I was disappointed. Characters in Short Cuts, while dealing with horrible times in their lives, refused to let you in to it. You were, for the most part, left guessing as to why they felt or behaved as they do. Perhaps that was the point, I mean with 22 characters I don't expect as much in character development as I would with 4 (as in Who's Afraid of Virgina Woolf?). But to deny to viewer any indication as to why the characters were acting as they do just defeats its own purpose. How can I empthise for someone who just acts horrible for no apparent reason. The stories were fine, and I believe as 10 separate short films they could stand on their own, but for no reason we are just expected to ACCEPT the fact that a cellist just wants to kill herself because the world is bad, and a pool guy out of nowhere just becomes a killer? What's the motivation.Unlike Magnolia I couldn't bring myself to feel for these people. Neither one way or the other. The film left me blank. I was hopeful though in a few situations. The ex husband who destroys his wife's home was very promising, but was abandoned. There was no conclusion. And the doctor when he finally learns about his wife... Finally I thought that some of that built up rage for three hours would spill forth. And it did. But... then there was a clown party with liquor and all was forgotten...In conclusion... Short Cuts had no conclusion. Perhaps that was the point. But since I wasn't allowed into the very characters that I was watching I guess I'll never know. Five/Ten",

            "content": "Short Cuts, the three plus hour long film written and directed by Robert Altman (with co-writer Frank Barhydt), based upon a series of short stories by Raymond Carver, is an odd film. It's not a bad film, nor is it even remotely a great film- the only two sorts of films that the hit (Nashville) and miss (Vincent And Theo) Altman has plenty of experience with. The nine stories and one poem of Carver's, from the same titled anthology book, have been transplanted from the Pacific Northwest to Los Angeles, and many of the stories are made to cross over with each other, where they were unconnected in print, as well from different story collections, with several characters being based upon more than one character to help achieve that end. The problem is that the film loses focus when it centers on lesser written tales, which Altman does not make better, and on some tales which he actually makes worse. There are ten stories and two dozen characters that fill the screen, and a plenum of human melodrama, drama, and darkness fill the screen: joy, sadness, jealousy, fear, reconciliation, pain, infidelity, and death- accidental, murder, and suicide are among them.The quick moving vignettes are so filigreed that to do justice to each would take far too long, but most work well, until it comes to their resolutions\u0085. Short Cuts is a film almost wholly devoted to the written word, as all great films are, but its 'little above average' goodness, rather than greatness, stems from the fact that the words of Carver- as hit and miss in prose as Altman is on film, are never allowed their full power nor poesy. Despite what others have said, Carver was no minimalist. Becekett was a minimalist. Carver was merely lean in his prose- which is not synonymous with minimalism, but he was rich in characterization and 'moment'- at his best. This film never quite finds that groove. It is like 85% of the way to an orgasm, but the result is that its wad is never shot, although its member ripens. This impotence comes not only from the screenplay's flaws, but from the anomic cinematography of Walt Lloyd- who will have no one comparing him to Sven Nykvist, and the off the rack musical scoring of Mark Isham.There is also much pointless nudity in the film- mostly female, which has led feminist critics to damn the film. Usually, their critiques are downright silly- and vapidly lead them to stick out their tongues and call Carver a 'misogynist', or worse. He's not, clearly, but as the nudity is pointless- such as a muff shot of Julianne Moore cleaning wine from her dress as she fesses up to her infidelity, why is it included? Is her orange pubic hair so greatly symbolic or ironic? No. Is it realism? Perhaps, but it is 'cheap realism'. Marketing is a more likely and truthful reply. Yet it is the 'real realism' of the film that is mother to its best moments, little moments like Paul Finnigan's egg trick, Claire Kane's pretending to sign the guest book at the funeral of the dead girl her husband had no compassion for, or the humorous photo mixup where Gordon sees the photos of a 'dead' Honey that Bill staged, and Honey and Lois see the photos of the dead girl in the river that Gordon also did not empathize with, which lead both parties to memorize the others' license plates in order to report them to the police. That the 'real reality' of this work of art is so few and far between, and leads to its diminution, one wonders what a good dollop of, say 'real fiction' may have added? A little more Carver and a little less 'tang may have been the best and shortest cut this film had to greatness.",

Unwatchable? Well, it depends. If you're snug enough to have no interest in alienation, sure. If you want a tight plot, a conclusion that ties up all the loose ends, and black-and-white goodies and baddies, you're in for a let-down. You find life quite messy enough without having to watch messy movies? Or having to read short stories? But -! Short stories capture moments: the funny ones, the sad ones, the poignant ones, the unexpected turns in the accidental plots that are our lives. Add Altman to Carver and you get the same thing in a different medium. I'm not qualified to judge but I find Short Cuts obviously gorgeous - cast, cut and photography. On top of that, Annie Ross (of Lambert, Hendricks and Ross) delivers just the soundtrack it takes. You've never read Carver? You've never heard Ross? Ah. It's never too late to work on having been born too late. Here's where to begin. There are lots of moments to savour in this film. Over and over.",

There is little to fault and even though the film runs at quite considerable length it moves along in a tight way some movies half its length fail to do. The acting is top rate thanks to Altman's usual eclectic bunch of misfits that only someone such as he could assemble, and pull off. The slow zooms that Altman puts into every scene add to a growing menace creeping up on you. It's a subtle thing. It works. My favourite narrative has to be the couple played by Lily Tomlin and Tom Waits. I just love them. I love the look on Tom Waits face when he says 'with a broke yoke'. The unease of Anne Archer's face when she realises how long her husband left the body underwater whilst continuing to fish. This in itself is a horrifying revelation about how our priorities become distorted. The way Andie MacDowell hugs Lori Singer after he son has died and the way she reacts. Her body literally taking on board the sadness and loss. But there are many moments of hilarity and the craziness and spontaneity of life. The dog on the side of the bike. The mixing of photos. More than anything the film is a wonderful mixed bag. You see many stories and some you take away and some you leave behind. All are very much insightful about our lives. Spend time with this film.",

            "content": "By the time Robert Altman directed Short Cuts, in 1993, his style of interconnected and quirky characters in the format of a large cast was becoming trendy. The nineties would see other famous examples of this approach by big name directors, notably Tarantino's Pulp Fiction in 1994 and Paul Thomas Anderson's' Magnolia from 1999. There was even a Simpson's episode in this vein in 1996 called '22 Short Films About Springfield'. Even though Altman was one of the inventors of this style, or grouping of styles, Short Takes suffers some from being in the age of such movies, rather than a monumental predecessor. Altman came close to perfecting the large, interconnected ensemble film in 1975 with Nashville. This film was more of a portrait of a unique city with its own music and culture and a portrait of the times rather than a character study or a gripping pot boiler. So the title made sense. Perhaps an even more accurate title would have been Nashville 1975. Altman excited audiences by making a large scale portrait of a time and place, full of complexity and brimming with interesting little stories and people. By 1993, the charms of these new developments were starting to wear off, and the nineties would sap the creative reservoir (and audience patience) of such sprawling films.Nashville is a better film---it cracks with energy and humor, it radiates a cynicism that was new in the 70's but is now commonplace. Short cuts fails to be a larger portrait as Nashville was. Nashville's true main character was the city herself. All the pieces fit to make a larger structure. This large structure may have been gaudy and odd, but it was worth building. Short Takes takes place in L.A. Suburbs, but is not about them. It feels like it takes place there because it was convenient, not because Altman had developed a Nashville-like interest in the area. The stories are thus highly reliant on their connections, though these can feel contrived. There is too much material here, even for 3 hours, to mine much real depth with individuals, and so the shattered pieces of a whole are hurt by never fitting into a larger structure. Nashville was 'weird' because it was about a city, Short Takes is 'weird' because it is about nothing. It seems appropriate that this movie came from the age of Seinfeld.Nashville was better and more innovative, but Short Takes was still on the front edge of the nineties trend of piecemeal interconnection dramas. It seems unfair that Pulp Fiction is so much more heralded and Magnolia is more remembered and loved. Why? Pulp Fiction might be more silly fun, and Magnolia might be by arguably the most gifted director of the three, but Short takes feels left behind by these films even though it was first, from a historical point of view. Part of this comes from the tone. The film is not touching or dramatic in the conventional sense. The viewer doesn't care about anyone in particular. We feel as upset for the girl killed by Chris Penn's character (she has only a few lines) as we do for anyone. Through its sheer fun Pulp Fiction makes you care about the characters in at least a passing way. Magnolia is a web of quirky, interconnected characters, but has more thematic and emotional focus. Short Cuts feels insincere at times, dramatically, and falls into clich\u00e9s which are amplified by the lack of time any one line of a character is given. The attempts at darkish humor fall flat or feel confusing as to whether they are serious or tongue in cheek. Despite a huge cast of huge names, the actors seem as confused and aimless as the audience. There are very good actors everywhere here and so sometimes good acting comes here and there, but there is a subdued feeling like all the talent has been handicapped. This is a good film if you are in a patient mood, but far from Altman's best work. Six stars.",

And I've seen plenty of +4hour movies, no comparison here. The score was also horrible, waxy, the dying nightmarish sound that would not stop, each song starting sounding exactly the same as the last one with lyrics of the same thing that means nothing. I got a real existential crisis because of it.The odd thing is that all the subjects in the stories are things that if I heard a movie included, I would surely bet it would have to be interesting. It isn't. It's like listening three hours to an old annoying high-pitched mean town gossip tell the stories of her neighbours that you've never met and have no interest in ever knowing, down to the last details on how they ps, fish and iron their shirts.

            "content": "This film is based on a poem and several stories by the American short story writer, Raymond Carver, who I think is one of the greatest short stories writers of the 20th century.  For a while I used to seek out movies which were based on novels or short stories. Then, if I enjoyed the film, I'd check out the original literary source. Alan Parker's film, BIRDY, turned me onto the works of William Wharton, and Scorcesse's LAST TEMPTATION OF CHRIST turned me onto Nikos Kazantzakis. But Altman's SHORT CUTS didn't do anything to turn me onto Raymond Carver. I didn't go looking for Raymond Carver after I saw the movie, and I'm not the only one.  And that's a shame, because Carver's work deserves better.I hadn't read any Raymond Carver when I first saw SHORT CUTS. As a film, it just didn't work for me at all. I wasn't emotionally drawn into any of it. Tom Waits was, as usual, fun to watch, but otherwise I didn't feel for any of the characters. They weren't real to me.  Now, years later, having read all of Carver's short stories and poems, in the film, the intimacy and the realism of Carver's work and the lingering quality of his images did not translate to the screen at all.Take a story like \"Careful,\" for instance. That's a story about a guy who's separated from his wife and he's living on the top floor of a house having champaign and doughnuts for breakfast one morning when his wife drops by to have a talk, except he can't hear her very well because he has wax build-up in one ear and they spend the whole time trying to find a way to get the wax out of his ear instead of talking about what she wanted to talk about.  I haven't read that story in about 8 months and I can remember it---I can *see it* now---perfectly, like something I actually witnessed.When I read a Carver story, it leaves an impression---to say the least. SHORT CUTS didn't even come close to having that effect on me. I didn't walk away thinking, \"Wow,\" like I do most of the time when I read a Raymond Carver story. Half an hour later I couldn't remember anything about the film and was glad to forget it.  This film pales in comparison to the power of Carver's written words. As a film and as a adaptation, SHORT CUTS is a failure.Tess Gallagher, Carver's window, was apparently pleased with how this film came out, but I wonder if Carver himself would have approved had he been alive.  I sure don't.  Reading a Raymond Carver story is like listening to the blues: it might be about a depressing situation, but it lifts your spirit out of that depression in the way it's presented.  SHORT CUTS fails to do this. Most likely it'll just bring you down.On a happier note, I would recommend the films of Krzysztof Kieslowski (BLUE, WHITE, and RED for instance) to anyone who wants to experience the realism and the intimacy of a Carver short story on film.  Kieslowski comes as close to it as anything I've seen.  Carver's work in Kieslowski's hands would have been a perfect match. Too bad.",

The legendary underdog Robert Altman, who directed and co-wrote here, based this off of Raymond Carver's short stories, but really turned it into his own unique peek into the lives of these southern Californians. We see a doctor, a painter, a motorcycle cop, a baker, a news broadcaster, a lounge singer and her cellist daughter, a diner waitress, a makeup artist, a pool cleaner, a phone sex operator, and other interesting characters' stories, and how they interconnect in different ways. One of the most remarkable aspects of \"Short Cuts\" is how it's so much like real life with all its randomness and interruptions, about as close as any movie can come. Altman includes such early '90s pop-culture aspects as the cartoon \"Captain Planet,\" and a child's love of this show. The blaring television in the background serves as but one reoccurring theme, just a tool that helps make this an authentic story of American life.I was reminded of certain other films while watching this, such as Richard Linklater's plot-less low-budget cult hit \"Slacker\" from 1991, a movie about eccentric characters in Austin, TX and their criss-crossing lives, shifting from one little story to the next. I also see how highly influential this must have been towards P.T. Anderson's \"Magnolia,\" another mosaic of everyday life in southern California.It's rare that a film comes along like this, chock full of unexpectedness just like us, just like real people.

This is one long, meandering, plotless movie, but what variety! And just when a scene starts to be getting long or boring, it switches to a brand new set of characters.  (My only criticisms: Andie MacDowell isn't yet ready to play with the big boys, and Peter Gallagher should have had a much bigger part.)

People did things, stuff happened, but never did a coherent storyline develop. So I might as well have walked from neighbor's house to neighbor's house asking what they did today. Took a dog out for a walk, went fishing, got the pool cleaned, fought with the spouse, saw the neighbor take his dog for a walk, blah, blah, blah. The ONLY redeeming part of the movie was seeing Julianne Moore completely naked. I don't know whether I was titillated or simply stupefied by the non-sequitor. Well, I was titillated a little.

            "content": "SHORT CUTS (C-) is Robert Altman's blend of eight different Raymond Carver stories about the intersecting lives of different residents in Los Angeles. The eight stories cover a wide spectrum of income levels, jobs, sexes, and relationships throughout its three hour runtime. On the plus side, the stories move fast and switch between each other often, making it a pretty quick three minutes. The ensemble cast is great and give unique traits to each of their characters and storylines. On the downside, each story is a bummer, especially for all the men. It feels as if they laid out there stories with the starting question: what are the many ways in which a male cane be a disappointment? One story has a man who cheats on his wife, another who is a bum dad and is jealous of the new boyfriend, an alcoholic, a pushover, a non-communicator, and another with three fishermen buddies who oogle a waitress and find a dead body in the river but don't want to report it because it will ruin their fishing trip. I guess titling the film \"The Shortcomings of Man\" would've been too on the nose here. There's more here as well - kids and dogs are annoying, neighbors are jerks and snoops, the government is blanketing the city with bio-chemicals, patrons at bars proposition you for sex, etc. You get the idea yet? The interweaving stories are stories of misery. Additionally, the film is filled with explicit sexual talk (especially in the phone sex operator storyline) and random full-frontal nudity - which is I guess a way of being \"real\" but instead it feels gratuitous to me. The stories and how everyone treats each other are depressing enough that we don't need the shock of unexpected nudity to punctuate it. I really don't think seeing Huey Lewis pull his penis out to pee in a river helped this film in anyway. Thank goodness the actors are able to find some notes of humanity here, because though it is interesting, the film is a slog of evil without much redemption at all - reminds me of Altman's MASH in that instance. There's just no interest here in putting the finger on why so many people are suffering so greatly or what could offer salvation. This is the kind of movie that, despite the obvious craft, I end up hating for watching. It's artificially designed to present the evil side of humanity with little in the way of judgment or insight.",

You watch depressed/ angry/ unpleasant characters flit and interact. There isn't one redeeming/ uplifting/ positive/ life-affirming moment. OK, wait: In the end, Waits & Tomlin celebrate their poverty and alcoholism in a dreary trailer; Robbins has sex with Stowe and brings the dog back home; MacDowell & Davison eat pastries with baker Lovett after their child dies. Yeah, sorry, all upbeat stuff.Altman was a brilliant creator (3 Women, Nashville, Mash), capturing the American panorama and subconscious like no other director. Amazing in the range of topics he undertook. But over time he relied increasingly on dialogue to move his (lack of) plot forward. For many this skim was the invisible hand of meaning - \"What is he trying to say here? It's obscure so it's gravid.\"Short Cuts has all the Altman signatures: annoying lounge music that permeates everything, overlapping dialogue, characters staring at fish or fixed objects as they think about the meaning of life, overlapping dialogue, near-constant elevator jazz, characters who talk from the script and to the camera but not to each other, overlapping dialogue.It might be a TV show that charms via \"lives of idiosyncratic, tortured, neurotic characters intersecting & intertwining in a fictional yet all-too-real city of desire, failed dreams ....\" The kind of thing where folks say \"OMG, that is SO my family\". Except for the bit where Penn beats a girl to death with a rock; or the guy who took pictures of the girl he raped and strangled.Scenes or characters you might care or wonder about are never fully-explored; other scenes (eg. Lemmon's description of boinking his son's aunt) go on and on. And on. You got it, and still it continues. Perhaps this is a mirror that forces us to confront our inner selves while we confront our outer lives, as we reflect on ....There's some nice acting: Robbins, Stowe, Tomlin, Jason-Leigh, McDormand, Davison, Gallagher, Chris Penn, Lili Taylor, more. But almost anyone can get good performances out of these folks.Meryl Streep - sorry, I mean Julianne Moore - does her usual \"watch me, I'm REALLY acting\" - especially when she is nude from the waist-down in the pre-BBQ scene. Andie MacDowell, as always, squeezes her lack of range into playing herself. Same for Robert Downey Jr. and Lori Singer.Jack Lemmon does the stuttering, mumbling, rolling fingers uh-uh-uh alky-monologue thing that he (incredibly) made a career out of. His understudy Tom Waits does a gravelly-voice version of this. Boy, imagine if Altman had filmed an 8-hour version of an O'Neil play where Waits and Lemmon talk about life as they drink in a bar on a rainy day. Various characters could come and go, talking about the rain as they walk in; the bartender, perhaps a jaded Brian Blessed, would comment as he refilled their glasses .... Whew.Carver seemed to have insight, albeit through a whiskey glass, into the human spirit. But this movie version of his stories seems as contrived as a HS play. Look at the scene where Penn & Jason-Leigh consider having sex; or the photo-mixup scene; or the funeral scene where the dialogue approaches an Ibsen play: Sven opens his front door and a woman outside says \"May I come in? I'm yust in town and I want to tell your father's last words as he died from syphilis ... yah, I'm your sister; the maid is your real mother; and the bank president, see the insanity in my left eye ...\" Oofta, people do jump in like that in real life.I got to page 3 of the reviews without reading anything negative about Short Cuts. I infer from this that viewers think a stage production where actors tell, but don't show, is good art. There it is.I gave it a 7 and considered an 8. Several parts were so irritating that I winced and squirmed so it's certainly effective.Two sidebars:1. If you think Carver would be difficult to bring to the screen, see the excellent Jindabyne.2. Altman over time became like his prot\u00e9g\u00e9 Alan Rudolph - vague and insubstantial - whereas Rudolph's quirkiness grew into meatier work.",

            "content": "spoilers herein-or whatever you people sayThe name could say it all. Robert Altman's film is one in which character development is not rushed, and therefore provides no short cuts for impatient viewers. Rather, it is one in which the viewer is able to \"hang out\" with unique characters that don't have insane desires, but rather live their lives by the day. Which is why these characters might seem frighteningly familiar. This is the first Altman film that I have seen, and before I watched it I already knew that director Paul Thomas Anderson has claimed to have \"ripped him off\" in many ways, and I quickly recognized the similarities between this movie and \"Magnolia\" while I was watching it, the main one being of course the structure; both movies have subplots that all seem to interlace together and unite them in the end in a very suttle way.I also found this movie to be similar to Richard Linklater's \"Slacker\", due to the constant movement of the characters as the movie continues through dialogue. However, it does not progress through its dialogue, unlike a Tarantino movie, but the general mood stays the same. The characters do not change or really accomplish anything, but that is the point of the movie, and it allows(as Altman would say) for the director to really \"hit that truth button\". Another similarity to Slacker would be that, although it creates a very relaxed atmosphere, it contains unpredictable events that are surprising but empty. They are surprising because they don't fit into the general mood of the story,but are empty because they don't contribute in any way, making the film progress. At the end of the day in both the movie and reality, it is a wonderful cinematic experience that makes the viewer ask the question \"Why aren't there more movies like this?\"",

It is also 3 hours, drags, slows down, speeds up, and the interweaving stories are really abstract.  With that said, let's get back to Short Cuts. Short Cuts takes place in Los Angeles (so does Magnolia), it's three hours long as well. Short Cuts has a huge ensemble of characters and interweaving story lines. Short Cuts has a med-fly epidemic, Magnolia has weather reports. And both films wrap their stories up with a disaster.(Hopefully that's not giving too much away). I'm not accusing P T Anderson of fraud, his movie is a totally different movie. I am just merely pointing out that these films have more in common than their length and huge cast. Short Cuts is excellent filmmaking and in my opinion much better than Magnolia. It's definitely lighter and the three hours doesn't ever really drag because each story is fun and leads into the next story. I started to get so into the stories I forgot about how each one plays into a bigger picture. This movie is dark in parts too, dark and depressing.

I can't see much difference, though admittedly it's in a different dimension for quality.In Britain, there is a soap EastEnders which has a reputation for being particularly gritty and depressing.  That sums up what I felt during and after I watched Short Cuts.  Depressed.  What pathetic lives, with their petty miseries, and nobody trying to even aspire to anything more meaningful or spiritual.  Even the doctor (Matthew Modine) who somehow one wants to show a bit of humanity fails and turns away not making eye contact while telling parents devastating news about their only son's condition.American Beauty (in my opinion) is a far more watchable film about malaise in modern American life.  It has haunting beauty, and laugh-out-loud humour as well as its sweet and rotting sadness.  Short Cuts however is difficult to assess.  It is one of those films which are undoubtedly great, yet are not enjoyable to watch.  Maybe 8/10 for film making quality, but only 1/10 for enjoyment.",

I haven't read Raymond Carver's short stories but it didn't stop me from loving this film. It is really funny in a strange way. Like you are laughing but under really strange and ridiculous situations. Another great aspect of the film is how all the characters are absolutely \"characters\". They are not 100% realistic people (except maybe Andie MacDowell and Bruce Davison who should play it straight) in 100% real situations. The theme of the film or what holds it together is about people doing what is best for themselves in the immediate that has larger implications on the people around them. Or taking \"short cuts\".

            "content": "I saw this movie again last night and, like an old friend with which you had a bit of disagreement long ago but you are happy to see again, I found it most enjoyable. Well, enjoyable by an artistic, cinematic point of view. Certainly not by a human point of view since at the end, the shallowness and downright ugliness of some of the characters, came back to make me feel again that lingering subtle sense of depression at life being sometimes so unpalatable. That same bitterness at the back of your mouth after a not-so-honorable spree the night before. And yet the movie is one that you will never say: I've had enough of this. You do want to follow the different personas, their briefly brushing of self-contained lives, hoping a new story will develop, a redeeming character will appear. But no one enters from the left to shed light. Everyone is self-absorbed.I looked at the some of the other reviews to see if someone else had my same hunch and did not find any reference to what I think is Altman's inspiration for this canvas of American lives: Federico Fellini. Where La Dolce vita was a large fresco of a certain society at a certain point in time, here Altman wants to represent on a large, spread out mural a number of characters loosely connected or separated by their own materialism, hoping that, in the end, what the viewer sees is the colors and shape of a bustling city that can only be L.A. Where Fellini had a Ulysses-like character (Mastroianni) representing himself and his awe at the confusing life of a cynical old city on the verge of modern materialism, Altman does not have an himself watching and connecting the stories but tries to be more objective, more detached, letting the individual stories develop kind of casually. This is because the script does not come from him, from his own experiences ( as I understand the aging singer character is his only contribution to the plot) but from a number of short stories written by someone else. So, where Fellini is telling us of his own fears, surprises and expectations Altman is recounting someone's else story, a story that he is trying to tell not interpret, hoping that it will speak to the viewers by itself. So, if Fellini's fresco reminds me of The Triumph of Death in the cemetery of Pisa, scary, bigger than life and never to be forgotten, Altman's work reminds me of those many , beautiful murals one can see all over the world: busy, colorful, confusing and devoid of perspective but which one goes away from with a bit of bitter aftertaste for not having told a more decisive, clear message. An 8 nonetheless.",

He has in my point off view an eye for subtlety and gives his actors almost enough freedom so they can rise above themselves. This is also the case in Short cuts. Almost all characters have a link between each other and storylines are overlapping in this fine dramady about seemingly common L.A. inhabitants in the nineties, who are not so ordinary and sometimes react a bit odd to things that are happening in their life. Love and hate, failure and success, sanity and madness have a thin line between them. Altman doesn't need to ask his actors to play in this picture. They\u00b4re all enjoying the opportunity to perform in this 4 hours lasting masterpiece.",

Though the book may have been worth something when it was written, the film is useless.  Most of the stories are real testaments of modern life, and in that is the only reason why it should be recognized.  After that, not much is left to praise, except for a few amusing moments with Peter Gallagher, and Lyle Lovett.  The film could be compared as the Magnolia/American Beauty of the early 90's.  But then one would fail to realize that at least both Magnolia and American Beauty were fun to watch, artistically enjoyable, have key points, and kept your interest.  It's bad enough you watch an eyesore with no cinematographical appeal (ala documentary style texture, angles, and movement), but having to go through 3 hours of it... lets keep our nasty comments to ourselves here. This movie is sequenced into fragments you get to see in parts. STAY AWAY FROM THIS FILM unless you are doing case study on LA, or social decadence, or blunders of film, or poop.  Other critics praise how Altman makes you relate to the characters, and the rarity of realism this film has to offer on social decadence.  Well for one, I can relate to my Dad's life, that doesn't it would make a good story. I would have liked to see Peter Gallagher and Tom Waits gone on a drunken, balled-up rampage around town and fish tail Gallagher's classic car into various mailboxes and small erect structures. And if Altman wanted to display sociopaths in real life situations around LA, he could just as well have had hired retards to work at Del Taco for a day.  Did I mind you to STAY AWAY FROM THIS FILM?    -The main grudge with this film is that it is NOT interesting-and it's 3 hours longscudkat",

            "content": "I've spent the last couple of months working on a paper that compares the work of Robert Altman and Paul Thomas Anderson, but for some bizarre reason I waited until two weeks before the paper was due to watch this film.  Sure I read about it, most specifically in comparison to Magnolia, but since I couldn't find a DVD and I was a lousy cheapskate and didn't want to spend rental fees, I delayed.   Oh, how I wish I had seen this film earlier as it has instantly become a personal favorite on the same level as Anderson's \"Magnolia\" only brilliant in different ways.I don't know where to begin talking about the great things about this film. Actors rarely seem more entertainingly real than in Altman's films.  Films like Nashville and M*A*S*H managed to capture people at their best and at their worst, at their most ironically mockable moments and at their most painful, yet while those other films felt somewhat forced together through shared location, Short Cuts made the location the force that linked the story together, and the relative isolation of the stories from each other spoke volumes about the disconnectedness of humanity, just like Stewart and his friends looked at the dead body in the stream as a distraction from fishing more than as human remains.  More than anything else, this film is made up of great moments.  There's the relish of Stormy Weathers' destruction of the home from which he had been ousted, Jerry Kaiser's shocking moment of rage that seemed both sudden and yet unsurprising, Jack Lemmon's slow exit down an empty hospital hallway, and Bitkower's desperate attempt at apologizing for a sin more aggregious than he meant to perpetrate.  I will get this film when it is released on DVD.  It is fabulous.  I hope that Robert Altman continues to work for as long as possible, for he is one of the great pioneers of American Film.10/10",

And no wonder, I thought, the way it portraits women. While the male characters come off as untrustworthy, egocentrical bastards with clear fidelity and emotional commitment issues, the female cast are subtly revealed as antipathetic, cold-hearted, kaniving parasites who use all external factors (their kids, carrier, other men etc) as momentum in achieving what they want for themselves. In all, the spectre of stereotypical LA inhabitants pollute every scene of the film up to the point where the closest the film come to a voice of reason is that of the clown, who as a profession conceals her true face for a painted on smile to be laughed at and ridiculed by strangers. Returning to the physical aspect of the man- woman relation, the female promiscuous behavior and casual exposure in contra-sexual context and the returning male inappropriate, innuendous and disrespectful attitude towards sex with their reluctant \"significant others\", made me realize I despise human nature all together.

To me, as a cineaste, it's like \"Robert Altman meets Woody Allen\", and I don't mean the simply funny parts of Allen's work. It's \"Annie Hall meets M*A*S*H\". Hard to imagine, that someone turns it off, since you can't know how it continues. Also hard to imagine for a European, that the full 3 hour version is available in the US. There are no taboos, it's the Real Life this movie is about, and just as the real life, you just can't know what's next. No need for artificial suspense, in this regard this masterpiece beats every soap-opera. It's art, and I can imagine that it shows some viewers how jazz is connected to the Real Life just as arguments in a relationship are.Robert Altman's work basically consists out of two genres. The \"few persons\", \"highly intellectual\" movies and movies like M*A*S*H (I believe there's no description necessary since everybody knows it). \"Shortcuts\" is more like M*A*S*H, with the difference that it brings intellectual thoughts to a broader audience, due to the simplicity of the stories, the \"soap opera style\" and the extreme high quality of portraying life as it is. In the end, that's what intellectual movies are all about.But you'll never ever have the feeling you're watching an intellectual movie. This is not Jean Luc Godard - this is easy, easy like Sunday Morning. Easy like Woody Allen's funny but thoughtful movies.The cuts are great, you'll never ever realize that you're watching a 3 hours movie (unless you're watching a clock too).Yes, it is Robert Altman's best movie.

The title is even an insiders' joke about getting from point A to point B in a town where everyone measures the distance in the minutes it takes to arrive and the time of day that gives you the edge over the traffic nightmares.The malathion spraying for agricultural pests in an area where the cash crops are concrete, hype, and real estate is the clincher.

The main one is probably that I made sure to read all 10 Raymond Carver pieces that were used for the screenplay.  I'm the kind of person who prefers to read a book/play/short story before I see any filmed version of it.  This is usually a good idea, but not in this case.  Altman is creating his own world with SHORT CUTS--there are elements of Carver, but it's not a straight adaptation of that master storyteller's work.  I'm afraid knowing the stories may have cut down on my enjoyment of this movie.  It's a strong film, but didn't sweep me up the way that the other 90s Altman pictures I've seen (THE PLAYER and COOKIE'S FORTUNE) were able to do.  I wasn't surprised that Altman chose to focus on the darker, earlier work of Carver--it fits his filmmaking style much better than the warmer stories that Carver wrote in the final years of his life.My advice to anyone about to watch SHORT CUTS is to hold off on reading the Carver stories (if you have any intention of reading them) until after you've seen SHORT CUTS.  If you are a stranger to Carver's work, I hope that your curiosity will be piqued by this film.  I'd also watch this film before MAGNOLIA if you can--I think you'll be more open to appreciating SHORT CUTS than I was.",

Don't get me wrong, I love \"Short Cuts\" to death, but I think that the different stories and characters in the film are too literal, whereas in \"Magnolia\" there is just enough of an edge and even a little humour involved to make it work better for me. Also, in \"Short Cuts\", what gets resolved at the end of the picture? What happens to Jack Lemmon's character, last seen slowly walking down the hospital corridor after his grandson's death? Why in the world did Chris Penn's character kill that woman (maybe because his wife's line of work bothered him, which it obviously did, but then, what's the connection between that and his desire to inflict damage upon another human being?)? What happens to Julianne Moore and Matthew Modines' characters- we find out that yes, she did cheat on him, but the conflict is just dropped- okay, so he doesn't trust her anymore, but do they live happily ever after, get divorced, kill each other, what? Just too many questions. Perhaps this was the point, perhaps Robert Altman wants us to make up our own endings, but I just didn't get the all the openness and uncertainty at the end of the film. Okay, so \"Magnolia\" had some questions as well, but that film just worked better for me. Overall, however, \"Short Cuts\" is a fantastic character study with great performances all around and is one of my favourite Altman films...but it is heavily flawed, and when compared to the strikingly similar \"Magnolia\", it comes out a lesser film. 7 out of 10, a very very good film.

            "content": "And the dominant theme is: women good, men bad. Which makes this film both reflective and constitutive of the one of the dominant social themes of the early to mid nineties: the moral superiority of women, and women as victims vs. men as victimizers. To me, the image that sums up this movie: Huey Lewis's character urinating directly onto a nude female murder victim in the stream below; i.e. a man pissing on a woman. A related theme is the fragility of the more developed, more human as compared to the less human, lower form of life, usually embodied by a male character. This explains the seemingly gratuitous use of female nudity: women, the higher, the more beautiful, are mercilessly exposed to the gaping, befuddled, animalistic male, whether it's the murder victim, mistreated in death by the cretinous fishermen, Lily Tomlin's frazzled waitress being exploited visually by the same fishermen even while she's catering to her needy, ne'er do well boyfriend (Tom Waits), the sensitive, suicidal violinist being ogled by Chris Penn while she swims nude in her backyard, or Julianne Moore trying to defend herself over an affair to her insecure doctor husband (Matthew Modine), while completely naked from the waist down. The women-as-victims theme extends, of course, beyond the use of female nudity. Robert Downey, Jr. seemingly gratuitously punches a female image on a pillow and makes up his girlfriend (Lili Tyler) to look like a beaten woman in order to have sex with her, Tim Robbins cheats obviously and serially on his faithful, long-suffering wife, Peter Gallagher trashes his ex-wife's house, and, ultimately, Downey and Penn ditch their wives/girlfriends on a picnic to chase down two teenaged girls, and Penn in a fit of rage kills one of them. Only Moore seems to get the better of Modine. The two non-female victims in the movie are the little boy, Casey, and possibly his milder, somewhat feminized father (Bruce Davison), who is forced to relive his abandonment as a child by his father (Jack Lemmon). But, while he is relegated to a tragically terminal coma, Caseys' mother (Andie MacDowell) is harassed by phone calls from Lyle Lovett's deranged cake decorator. Further, it is in empathy for Casey's demise that the violinist kills herself. The casting and acting are great, the script is authentic and entertaining, and the editing and direction are impeccable.",

I do understand the importance of character development but redundancy can leave you disinterested in one or even all the players. In fact, some of them seem disinterested with themselves and the events occurring around or directly to them. They all seem to have to much restraint when it comes to emotions. Was this the point? If so, perhaps another hour should have been added to the film to better explain why. Did I mention this film clocks in at just over 3hours? I'm usually very patient when it comes to long films, but 3hrs felt like 5 in this case.This is not a bad film, but you can get the same kind of entertainment sitting on a park bench for a few hours.",

            "content": "although it's true the film is very long, i believe it is an ambitious piece of work that succeeds as a work of art that is imitative of life. altman does an excellent job with the pacing and tempo of this film which, due to the density of subject matter, is very important to its success. it begins to slow somewhat nearer the end but i believe this is a device meant to draw us in nearer the characters and allow us to reflect a bit about the events taking place, and the people surrounded by them whereas in the beginning there is so much action we are mostly receiving information and not so much reflecting on it. when i say that it is imitative of life i don't mean that if marriages are falling apart in the film and that happens in real life then VOILA!...art that imitates life. what i do mean is that it is thematically representative of life. for example, many people who have seen this film express dissatisfaction with a certain cliffhanger in the very end as well as a number of other \"loose ends\". however, i appreciate altman's willingness to not tie everything up in a neat little package for us in the end and this is how it is representative of the world we live in. things do not end in neat packages. mysteries go unsolved and people's motives remain undisclosed. some people get away with things and some people do not. i also believe that these so-called loose ends are a way for the movie to exists outside of itself, which is a mark of great art. we are left with the feeling that these lives will continue on without us and much will happen that we never see and this lends a power and realism to the film that should be respected. also notable are the exceptional performances of the all-star cast. andie macdowell gives probably the least praised performance (based on what i have read on this site) but she actually has me crying in a certain part. Tim Robbins is SUPERB and robert downey jr, although playing a character role in which he was obviously type-casted, is very funny indeed. if you have a spare 3 hours and you appreciate thoughtful film-making, see this movie.",

He shows us the a wide variety of professionals all sliding their way through life, all waiting for some event to justify thier existence, baffled at the place they are in life.  Many of the stories are funny, such as Burton's, where he constantly lies and cheats on his wife only to use bogus cop stories to cover up his whearabouts.  These fabrications are believed by no one but provide comedy for his wife and a sense of importance for Burton, even though he knows these stories aren't true, he states them in such a matter-of-fact manner that you sense he wants, and needs, to believe them. Altman doesn't just tell one side of each story but instead focuses on each character's counterpart.  He shows us the life of Burton's mistress and her ex-husband and son; he shows not only a married couple invited to dinner by another couple but all four people's lives. While some stories are funny, other stories are tragic such as the young child hit by a car and the neglected chelloist.  Overall this is a touching story that will entertain and touch you.",

            "content": "Short Cuts starts and ends on two huge LA disasters and inbetween these we are shown a small segment of eight different stories in LA. To be able to make all these tales understandable is in itself a great feat, but the way Altman does this, in such a subtle and poetic way completely gets you into the heart of this film. Altman is able to get the most heartfelt performances out of some actors who I had previously put down as boring crowdpleasers such as Andie McDowell and Jack Lemmon, yet these are the two actor who I felt were the best. As Jack Lemmon walks out of the hospital after trying to reconcile with his son and as McDowell manages to forgive a bitter, cake maker for harassing her and her son I was shown something about life which I had never felt before and which has only been shown again in Paul Thomas Anderson's Magnolia (almost the sequel to Short Cuts) and American Beauty, a beauty so profound that no amount of pain and suffering can hide. And this is the role of the disasters; in the film one gets so involved  in these painful stories of interconnecting lives that when the second disaster comes you are suddenly pushed away and see these stories from a larger viewpoint in the breathtaking montage of LA and see even suffering as beauty. After the commercial failure of Popeye 1980, Altman crawled back into his shell, making small and mainly unseen play films until 91 when he was given the chance to make a big all star film 'the Player'. This was a big success and allowed him the chance to make Short Cuts. Although beautifully photographed, it is subtly done so that it only adds and does not take your notice off the storylines, taken from the Raymond Carver novel which is such a perfect balance of humour and tragedy.

The problem with a film is how to create enough back story or forward story to turn it into a feature length film. Short Cuts uses a number of stories interlaced, which dilutes the purity of the originals in which every word is important within its context.For me the 1987 adaptation of \"Feathers\" is a much better attempt to put one of his stories on film.",

They all have their little stories that sometimes intersect, and then it all comes to a big dramatic conclusion that is disappointing and lacks finality. The difference is that Short Cuts is not part of a cinematic universe, these are not pre-established characters that I could learn about by watching their own movies, and there won\u2019t be a follow-up film to resolve the storylines. Instead it\u2019s just a bunch of horrible people living their miserable lives, and we get the joy of tagging along for the ride. Most of these terrible stories focus on broken marriages, infidelity, and death. There might be three sympathetic characters in the entire movie, and I was actually interested in their story, but Short Cuts doesn\u2019t have time to dwell too long on any one group of people. You can definitely see that Paul Thomas Anderson drew a ton of inspiration for Magnolia from this movie. I didn\u2019t particularly love that movie either, but at least he handled it a little better, and knew when to focus in on a powerful moment. Short Cuts is a movie that does nothing for me, and the few snippets of time that it was interesting and impactful were drowned out by the deluge of new characters and frustrating stories.",

Leading a large ensemble cast with an inter-weaving series of sub-plots (some more connected than others), Short Cuts was a big risk for Altman especially as he wasn't at his most popular phase when he shot it, but he has a strong basis for the film in its source material. Based off of the short stories of Raymond Carver, the sublime prose of those stories is readily apparent here (even if most of them are rather loosely adapted), and the material regarding marriage and sex are remarkably still raw by today's standards. Still, it's an Altman movie through-and-through, and he gives a bit of a Los Angeles-spin on Carver's work, by both capturing the massive landscape of the city, but also allowing more intimate close-up cinematography for the characters. The sub-plots are all human and fun, as well as quietly devastating at times too, and Short Cuts manages to conclude in a way that satisfies all the individual yarns, while not coming off as hokey.

Director Robert Altman transported these stories and expanded on them to the outskirts of Los Angeles among a cross-section of people unaffiliated with the entertainment industry. For the most part, Altman captures the spirit of Carver without doing a straight adaptation. Altman and Frank Barhydt wrote the script and they link the twenty-two characters together through random circumstances. It doesn't have the running commentary or overlapping dialogue we associate with Altman, but the multi-character viewpoint is there and the characterizations are more complex than in \"Nashville.\" Some of the stories and characters are more effective than others, and some have little relation to Carver at all. The presence of alcohol in the movie has less relevance to the overall action than in Carver's stories, and the earthquake finale fails to tie events together as successfully as the climaxes in Altman's best movies. At three hours, this moves at a fast clip. It comes closer to reflecting contemporary American life than almost any other movie of its era. Kudos goes to editors Geraldine Peroni and Suzy Elmiger. Among the standouts in the cast are: Bruce Davison, Fred Ward, Jack Lemmon, Lily Tomlin, Madeleine Stowe, Tom Waits, Tim Robbins, Julianne Moore. Also with Andie MacDowell, Anne Archer, Annie Ross, Buck Henry, Chris Penn, Frances McDormand, Huey Lewis, Jennifer Jason Leigh, Lili Taylor, Lori Singer, Lyle Lovett, Matthew Modine, Peter Gallagher, Robert Downey, Jr.",

Short Cuts? Is it even Altman's best work? Well, everything unique and original in the other movies on this list was done before... by Altman. (Is there anything the man hasn't tried?) And everything Altman achieved in his career can be summed up in Short Cuts.\n\nFive of the entries on my list are genre intact: gangster, war, bio, sci-fi, adventure. Lynch is a genre of his own (a master of hook and subvert), Pulp Fiction is pomo-noir with a swagger, Tree of Life, an audacious and transcendent poem, Boyhood, literally an epic achievement of dedication and commitment. Short Cuts doesn't seem to fit in as it is merely an observation of lives and love. But what observations! What lives! What heartbreaking affection. All underscored with a resonating heartbeat patching into so many paths, teetering on the brink of disaster and threatening to explode, which it does, in the form of a climactic planetary stroke. Nothing brings people together quite like a natural disaster. An earthquake, tremoring just enough to inform us of our place in history on the cosmic map. Enough to bring us down to earth, reboot our egos, and put multiple perspectives in perspective. Enough to appreciate the simple state of being. \n\nA larger-than-life baroque master is at the helm, warbling out contrapuntal narratives and swirling themes orchestrated to perfection. Multiple story-lines wavering under one very singular umbrella. And under Altman's protective cover the talent runs free and easy, playful and experimental, ironic and sincere. The key characters in one story become walk-throughs in another, paradoxically tethered and disconnected from the self, from family, community, and life. Boundaries are crossed and souls get lost. We're all the same if only by not knowing what our needs are or why we're even here. With nothing to say except everything is exceptional, infinite and empty. And life is short. Shorts Cuts of scenes stories words actions desire love loss lies lust faith wonder and devotion. Heck, I'd see it again only to watch Tom Waits and Lily Tomlin shack up.\n\nSome movies claim to be infinitely entertaining, some maintain they can be viewed repeatedly without losing their initial charm, some insist they never age, I know only one that can lay claim to all such conceits. Short Cuts is like falling in love. It delivers quietly, wonderfully, naturally, tenderly, simply and deeply.",

Altman doesn't pretend to sympathize with his characters, examining them objectively from a distance while inviting us to assess for ourselves. Imitating real life, the story is often uneven, and gives its characters varying degrees of closure without spoiling realistic ambiguity, and some subplots are left open-ended altogether.  Despite its many challenges, including a running time that just exceeds three hours, Altman's Short Cuts is ultimately an engaging and rewarding experience, and although it was released in the early 90's, the film's glimpse of middle class egotism is applicable now more than ever in the age of social media.",

This is a film that feels like it was made to be viewed in film school.  It feels like it's the movie that Magnolia and Crash would look to as their starting points.  It's meticulously controlled chaos, due to Robert Altman's masterful touch. Famous for his large casts and layered dialog, both of which are at work here, he also manages to get the performances of a career out of some of his actors.  The actors that are already great, shine even brighter, bringing a vibrancy to the weird and seedy side of suburban L.A.  While the overall narrative may lack coherence, by which I mean, as a first time viewer 20 years after its release, I was expecting there to be some sort of grand intersection of characters to inject a kind of decipher key to the storytelling, each tale stands out on its own, odd merits.  There's a perfectly drawn out tension to each tale, that's almost imperceptible until you realize you've let out a sigh of relief when some of the stories come to rather sedate conclusions.  For those that don't there's a sense of vindication for realizing you've been put on your guard.But even then, the twists and turns go by with an almost muted normality for this almost foreign world, as if asking \"what else did you expect from a world that poisons itself?\"  If only we could all feel our own every day moments of life as poignantly as we're encouraged to feel the characters' moments in this film.",

Altman creates an all-too-real atmosphere that his ensemble cast thrives in; his subtle camerawork and the editing make this scattered plot flow like a natural life. Although, the film mostly relies on the masterfully written screenplay and the actors abilities to personify their characters and really bring the film to life.

Short Cuts is one of his trademark films, which features a huge cast and a huge runtime.\nI tend to like star-studded anthology pieces and although of Short Cuts' cast I only truly \"love\" Tom Waits and Robert Downey jr. I'm still impressed by the sheer amount of starpower.\n\nActing is pretty good indeed but my main point of criticism is the plot(s) anyways. Altman orchestrates nine more or less interrelated stories about matrimony and other relationships and a lot of problems that seem a bit artificial. In its structure you could compare it to P.T. Anderson's Magnolia - just that Magnolia is far superior.\n\nAs I wasn't fully convinced by the plot the film dragged along a bit. Merely any momentum builds, and so, we hardly get any suspenseful scenes and by jumping from one narration to the next all the time Short Cuts stays superficial for most of the time and it never gets really deep into any of the given relationships.\n\nNot very suspenseful, not very dramatic but a runtime of three hours... You see the problem?\n\nTo further illustrate what I mean, I'd compare the film to a random three hour episode of a daily soap just with better production values and more skillfully made.",

            "content": "Once October rolls around this 2016, it will have been four years since the first time I watched \"Short Cuts.\" It was during a party my parents had planned for weeks, the kind where a bunch of middle-aged friends get together and talk about their most prevalent life problems, their most recent professional successes, over fine wine and aged cheese.  Naturally, a fifteen-year-old with nothing better to do on a lazy weekend afternoon hardly has a place in that kind of setting, and so, for its duration, I locked myself in my bedroom and wrapped myself in my silken sheets, the best way to pass the time being the viewing of \"Short Cuts.\" I played it on the ancient family laptop that had a bad habit of causing perfectly healthy DVDs to skip at the worst of moments; on that machine's most vindictive days, remote controls would all but temporarily disappear.\n\tPredictably, the three-hour, seven minute long \"Short Cuts\" did skip and did, of course, tuck away its remote controls during times I'd prefer it wouldn't (a family friend came upstairs to visit me around the period Julianne Moore gives her infamous monologue, a teenager's dream).  But in those mostly uninterrupted three hours of viewing did my perception of film change shape.  A mind that once figured that movies with a slice-of-life demeanor were good enough, I had no idea that a film as epic, as astronomical, as totally real as \"Short Cuts,\" could possibly exist.  In an art form that prefers to have its greatest of works last around ninety minutes, to detail the lives of two or three characters at a time, to have a single, easy-to-follow plot, \"Short Cuts,\" lasting about as long as \"War and Peace,\" fleshing out some twenty-two equally main characters, and intersecting its many stories with naturalistic ease, was something completely ethereal to me.\n\tHow could Robert Altman, one of the great America directors (\"Nashville,\" \"The Player\"), juggle so many characters, so many storylines, and yet make them all feel as immediate as the other? How could all these big stars (some established, some to be established) leap off their untouchable pedestals and recreate themselves as people as real as you or me? How could a movie three hours in length not seem quite long enough? How could it be cinematically possible to go from a hysterically funny scene to briskly turn to a devastatingly melancholy one and still ring as cohesive?\n\tA little over three years and hundreds of movies later since that initial viewing, I suppose I expected to be slightly less besotted with \"Short Cuts,\" as I've grown older and wiser and am becoming increasingly immune to certain aspects of filmmaking because I've seen so much in such a short time.  But nothing has changed.  I claimed it to be one of the best films ever made back in 2012 and still consider it to be so today - a film so deeply human, so heart-stoppingly byzantine yet so onerously simple, is not something one stumbles upon often when seeking celluloid based escapism.  It's even rarer to find a movie where the characters do nothing but talk, live, and emote, and are just as thrilling to live vicariously through as Steve McQueen's metaphorical car chase passenger in \"Bullitt.\"\n\tThe screenplay, co-written by Altman and Frank Barhydt, is an adaptation of nine short stories and a poem by prolific writer Raymond Carver, whose minimalist prose and ability to draw lifelike characters within the context of a short story rendered him as a revivalist of the form in his heyday.  Unfamiliar with his work and more in touch with what surrounds his name on Wikipedia, \"Short Cuts\" only lifts his characters, not his settings (switched from the Pacific Northwest to Los Angeles) nor the way the individuals on display are inevitably related.  The film could be an assemblage of vignettes designed to arrive one after the other, but Altman, an auteur whose liking of the clich\u00e9 that Everything Is Connected, does the impossible and links all twenty-two of its main characters with daisy chain strength.  Whether one is a neighbor of the other or if one is a cop stopping another character by chance for driving too slowly, the people of \"Short Cuts,\" regardless of class or race, compare in the ways that they're all trying to dig themselves out of gaping holes of discontent, though individual intensity, along with our reactions to them, ranges.\n\tJudge their everyday hardships for yourself.  We are voyeur to the lives of Ann and Howard Finnigan (Andie MacDowell and Bruce Davison), a well-off married couple (he's a TV newscaster) whose banal but comfy existence is shattered when their son (Zane Cassidy) is hit by a car.  Because he gets up and seems fine, and because he won't take any help because his parents told him never to talk to strangers, the driver, Doreen Piggot (Lily Tomlin), hesitantly departs the scene - at least she didn't kill him.  Her daughter (Lili Taylor) is best friends with Lois Kaiser (Jennifer Jason Leigh), a phone-sex operator unwittingly putting her marriage on the rocks because her husband (Chris Penn) is jealous that she never talks to him that way during sex.\n\t   Then there's Sherri and Gene Shepard (Madeleine Stowe and Tim Robbins), whose marriage is kind of shitty but somehow manageable; though she's aware that her husband, a motorcycle cop, cheats on her regularly (his current conquest is an equally morally unstable married woman played by Frances McDormand), she thinks his lies are hilariously fun to artificially buy.  Her sister, Marian (Julianne Moore), a bourgeois painter and her confidant, plays wife to husband Ralph Wyman (Matthew Modine), a doctor, but most of the intimacy that used to live between them has given way to distrust.  It might all come to a head during a dinner party they politely invite Claire and Stuart Kane (Anne Archer and Fred Ward) to, who themselves are arguing because he and his friends went fishing for a weekend and didn't let the dead body they discovered in their stream deter their fun until the Sunday they got back home.\n\tOther characters include Paul Finnigan (Jack Lemmon), Howard's father who decides to come for a hospital visit only to talk about himself, Zoe and Tess Trainer (Annie Ross and Lori Singer), a mother-daughter pair whose relationship is deterred by mom's fondness for liquor, Stormy Weathers (Peter Gallagher), the vengeful husband of Gene's mistress, and Earl (Tom Waits), Doreen's husband who might be irreplaceably flawless if he weren't so dependent on the bottle to get by.\n\tVerily, some of these stories are more engaging than others, but none of them ever feel unnecessary.  Like life itself, you have people you'd like to spend time with and people you'd prefer to stay away from, and, being the unfiltered reflection of everyday mundanity that it is, you've got to take the good with the bad and see where they all end up.  But in totality, there isn't a film quite like \"Short Cuts,\" unless you go down Robert Altman's filmography and start cherry-picking.  With its preeminent use of cross-talking for sake of verisimilitude, and for the way it's sad, or funny, in ways relatively down-to-Earth, we might as well consider ourselves to be watching a documentary.  Because that's what it feels like - \"Short Cuts\" doesn't so much regard itself as a movie as it does pass itself along as a collection of connected, average lives, riveting to watch because these people aren't so different from us, our neighbors, our friends, our family, our enemies.  We've all felt a desire to break down closed doors and see what goes on in the lives of those we know, those we know of, and the film very well might be a close enough representation.\n\tAnd since Altman pulls off that mightily difficult undertaking, his actors are faultless, too.  Everything about the ensemble is just about right, not appearing in roles but disappearing into people that might not be so much different from themselves (on a level of humanity, that is).  MacDowell and Davison are heartbreakingly emotive as people who once had it all, but are rapidly losing what made their existence something special.  Stowe and Robbins play house with convincing dysfunction, and Tomlin and Waits are touching as a middle-aged couple who are able to get by with little, able to keep their love alive after years together.  I love Leigh as the phone-sex operator, delivering dirty lines with passion as she performs blas\u00e9 tasks like changing her baby's diapers and making dinner, and I love Lemmon's brief performance as an absent father so distinctly aware of his failures as a guardian that he can't help but ignore the traumas in front of him and make everything about his own past mistakes.\n\tBut perhaps the finest moment in \"Short Cuts\" is the climactic fight scene between Ralph and Marian, which is as tense and explosive as it is scrupulously humorous.  The scene, taking place shortly before their sure-to-be-awkward dinner with the Kanes, depicts Ralph confronting Marian about a past infidelity.  But just as things are about to get raging, Marian spills white wine all over her skirt, which she was planning to wear for the party.  She rips it off and attempts to wash it, completely nude from the waist down, having to still fight for herself as things get increasingly hostile.  Marian's nakedness is both surreally funny and representative of the way all affinity has left the marriage; so well does this couple know each other that such physical display is hardly titillating - Ralph is much more content screaming at his wife than paying attention to her nether regions.  The scene is bizarre, intense, hilarious, but also expertly performed; is there a more fearless actress working today than Moore (whose career began the process of kicking off because of this performance), and is there an actor that could play Ralph with the same believable furiousness? The actors are effortlessly able to evoke a feeling of a marriage gone stale, and it's one of the best conversations Altman has ever written.\n\tBut \"Short Cuts,\" if we're being general, is one of the best films Altman has ever made, a wide display of his eccentricities accessible and immediate.  Even those not as in love with it as I am cannot pass by its brilliance without highly regarding the way Altman so easily makes the complicated simple and oftentimes intimate.  It's a skillfully performed film written and directed with the finesse of a virtuoso.  Altman's career only contains a few unmistakable masterpieces, the rest mostly good but nevertheless containing more than a couple of clunkers.  But \"Short Cuts\" is one of his rare masterstrokes, sure to be considered his magnum opus if \"Nashville\" didn't exist.  Movies like this are what keep the art of cinema alive - childlike wonder is not an unnatural reaction to have in the face of its splendor.",

What makes \"Short Cuts\" such a masterpiece, and my favorite Altman film, is the way he trusts his cast and they in turn, trust him too.\n\nIt's this vulnerability that the actors/actresses let him tap into that makes the film so rewarding and engaging to watch. This film feels like a seamless novel rather than a collection of short stories (or \"Short Cuts\"), everything flows effortlessly whether it's from a heart-wrenching story of every parent's worst nightmare (Andie MacDowell & Bruce Davison), a sleazy LAPD officer with a hungry heart (Tim Robbins), an upper-class marriage that's hanging by a thread (Julianne Moore & Matthew Modine), or an aging jazz singer battling a serious alcohol problem (Annie Ross) -- the viewer will float from one narrative to another without feeling lost.\n\nAs with any Altman film (Nashville, MASH), this is an actor's film and the performances are what makes it hum. It would be easy for a movie featuring 22 main characters to suffer from under or overacting in spots but in \"Short Cuts\", even the non-actors like Tom Waits are holding their own with heavyweight performers like Chris Penn.\n\nMy only complaint would be that some storylines aren't fleshed out as much as others (the medfly invasion) but this is a minor criticism compared to the scope of this film and how perfectly it's put together.

I love M*A*S*H* and Nashville, but wasn't quite as big on The Long Goodbye, McCabe & Mrs. Miller, or Vincent & Theo. I tend to doubt the claim that he was the world's greatest filmmaker, but this one was definitely pretty fantastic. It's an enjoyable but intense three-hour film about various lives in Los Angeles.\n\nThis is one of those movies, like Altman's earlier Nashville or Paul Thomas Anderson's Magnolia, that has an enormous cast of characters, mostly strangers to each other, whose lives sometimes intersect in ways they aren't aware of. This particular group is enormous - perhaps 25 or so main characters. It would take forever to describe all of them, so I'll just say that some of the characters have very dramatic things indeed happen to them, while others are just seeing another week in their lives. Their stories are collectively very interesting, and half the fun of the movie is trying to work out the chains of connection which interlace them all.\n\nNot all of the many actors fare that well in the movie. Andie MacDowell's performance is actually kind of bad, largely because she sometimes has a stupid Texas accent and sometimes doesn't. Chris Penn's performance is kind of stiff and awkward, as is Lyle Lovett's. Most of the actors do really well, though. Tim Robbins is surprisingly convincing as an outrageously dickheaded cop, and Madeline Stowe is very appealing as his long-suffering wife. Julianne Moore has some of the best scenes of her great career here, including one in which she delivers a monologue while quite plainly visibly naked from the waist down. Jack Lemmon gets a couple of fantastic scenes as an absentee grandfather. Lily Tomlin and Tom Waits are hilarious together as an alcoholic old trailer-trash couple. Jennifer Jason Leigh is excellent as a phone-sex operator who does her job while changing diapers. Robert Downey Jr. displays a lot of that wicked charisma that's made him so successful. Most of the rest of the large cast does quite well in their roles.\n\nThe script was adapted from a bunch of Raymond Carver stories by Altman and Frank Barhydt. It's extremely skillful both in the way it connects seemingly all of the characters without drawing attention to the fact that that is what it's doing, and in the way it juggles the storylines to keep them all feeling simultaneous. The movie is so long that you get to feel like you've known many of these characters forever, and you're always surprised when some new bit of information about them is revealed late in the film. Scenes parallel each other in ways the characters will never know about. Altman's camera objectively takes it all in, letting us see all of the details and getting to know each character without taking sides in their conflicts. There is some of that trademark overlapping Altman dialogue, but not too much, and it didn't get on my nerves the way it had in the past. The musical score is one of those unfortunate '90s musical scores that hasn't aged well. Still, this is overall a great movie, one that actually does live up to its reputation.",

At over three hours long, you have to be prepared to immerse yourself in these simple, every day storylines. Short Cuts is darkly funny, as well as sad and thought provoking.",

            "content": "After managing to escape largely cinematic abyss that was the 80s, Robert Altman had somewhat of a renaissance in the early 90s thanks in part to The Player, and this film.\n\nShort Cuts is a very loose adaptation of some of the writings of Raymond Carver, weaving together nine short stories and one poem into a tapestry of  life in Los Angeles that follows about 22 characters over the course of a few days. Carver's stories were originally not connected, and took place in the Pacific Northwest, but Altman decided to blend them together, finding links or short cuts between them to make a sprawling and colorful mosaic dealing with themes of death, infidelity, misunderstanding, jealousy, and the quest for fulfillment. \n\nIn many ways, I think I liked this more than Nashville, and found it even more accesible, despite the fact that this film is actually longer and a bit more rambling. Maybe it's just because I'm more familiar with the man's style and knew what to expect, which is something I couldn't say upon viewing Nashville.  I still think that Nashville is far more of a masterpiece and definitely more of an important cinematic and cultural touchstone than this, though. \n\nDon't ask me to list all the actors who are in this. That'd be insane. I will list my favorites though: Tom Waits, Lily Tomlin, Julianne Moore, Frances McDormand, Peter Gallagher, and Jack Lemmon. Plus, there's tons of nudity, and sexuality is a major part of this film in general. Some of it does start to become frayed and fall apart by the end, and, of course, some of the stories are better than others, but I do love the fractured, interconnected nature of things, and how some of the stories run concurrent with one another. \n\nAll in all, a film that was easier to get through than I might have anticipated. It's not a strict adaptation of Carver's work, and more like a jazzy, free form look at the essence of his stuff instead, but that's fine. If anyone could get away with doing that sort of thing, it was definitely Altman. As wonderful as this all is though, you might not want to approach this if you're an Altman newbie.",

I give it 20% for juggling the myriad of Raymond Carver-inspired stories, but this is the kind of movie that makes you wonder if film critics need to trade a few of their review sessions in dark theaters for a few hours at Chuck E.

I couldn't have cared less for these characters. An ICBM could've landed in L.A. killing them all and ending the film and I would've been happy at being spared the extra time having to watch their sordid affairs a minute longer.

Like a lot of Altman's work, \"Short Cuts\" feels loose and improvised although it actually sticks quite closely to the source material, often word for word. Altman has a way of making it feel natural, which is the essense of his style, and it serves Carver's work well.\r\n\r\nFrom the large all-star cast Lily Tomlin, Chris Penn and Jack Lemmon stood out for me. This is a film with many fine quiet moments, some less quiet ones, tragedies small and large, and a whole world bulging outside the parameters of the movie screen. It's populated with fully formed, recognizable characters and it rewards multiple viewings. There is a deceptively intricate structure to this movie that isn't necessarily apparent after a single viewing. (For example, and a mild SPOILER, I didn't realize one of the characters was a child molester until the second viewing. I'm embarrassed to say that I kind of sympathized with him the first time I watched it, and I just didn't pick up on it.) \r\n\r\nI think \"Short Cuts\" compares favorably to Altman's \"Nashville\", one of the greatest American films, and is light years better than \"Crash\" or \"Magnolia\", two fairly recent and wildly overpraised Altmanesque knock-offs. Those films hammered you over the head with their themes and were emotionally bombastic, Altman is much more subtle and assured. He trusts his audience and doesn't lecture to them. This is a great movie. 5 stars.",

            "content": "Robert Altman has never shied away from casting every actor known to mankind in his films, and this is certainly true with his 1993 film \"Short Cuts\", a film set in Los Angeles over the course of a couple of days. In terms of primary actors, ones that had a substantial enough part to merit a supporting tag, I count at least 22 characters here; but more impressive than the sheer number of the cast is the fact that the film does not suffer from character overload, nor do their intertwining stories. \"Short Cuts\" is simply about human relationships, all of which seem to be completely unhealthy. The beauty of Altman's script and direction is that this isn't imminently apparent in all cases. Something as subtle as a sigh and a minor roll of the eyes speaks volumes in a film this well done. The acting in the film is, to be expected, great in most cases. Andie MacDowell, though not quite as insipid as usual, is still pretty bad, but gems like Lyle Lovett, Peter Gallagher, Tom Waits and a fairly fresh and new Julianne Moore more than make up for any minor acting mishaps. There are not many films that are so involved that I simply throw up my hands at the prospect of doing my standard summary review for them, but \"Short Cuts\" is one of them. The script is compelling enough to easily sit through all 187 minutes of the film without getting tired or bored a bit, and the ending doesn't disappoint (except that the family of Casey didn't know who killed their son), and the film contains a cool jazz score. Like Altman's other great films which I enjoyed like \u00e2\u0080\u009cM.A.S.H.\u00e2\u0080\u009d, \u00e2\u0080\u009cNashville\u00e2\u0080\u009d, and \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe Player\u00e2\u0080\u009d; this one is I think his best, longest, and my favorite because of not the all-star cast, good story and script, but on a very effective and very influential moment that we get to see on movies and on real life as well.",

Now then, if you love ensemble casts, compelling stories and a director who is somehow able to juggle 22 parts for three hours, pull up a chair and steel yourself in.  There\u00e2\u0080\u0099s no way to do justice to Altman\u00e2\u0080\u0099s adaptation of Carver\u00e2\u0080\u0099s writings in one review but suffice it to say, the good outweigh the bad, which is no easy accomplishment when you consider we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve got a child being hit by a car, crumbling marriages, thoughts of suicide, alcoholism, ignoring a nearby corpse, Alex Trebek and The Planeteers of \u00e2\u0080\u009cCaptain Planet\u00e2\u0080\u009d fame.  And that's about 30 percent of the stuff going on here.  It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a movie that demands repeat viewings since these characters enter into and out of each other\u00e2\u0080\u0099s respective stories and while some may perform better than others (Jack Lemmon shines while Peter Gallagher somehow manages to make using a chainsaw for revenge boring, Julianne Moore does surprisingly well while the almost-always reliable Andie MacDowell oscillates between \u00e2\u0080\u009cgreat\u00e2\u0080\u009d and \u00e2\u0080\u009cwhere\u00e2\u0080\u0099s the fast forward button on this remote?\u00e2\u0080\u009d), the end result is one that leaves you feeling you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve just seen something great.  Granted, you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve seen a depiction of struggles in suburbia Los Angeles circa 1993, but it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s still pretty captivating.

Where \"Nashville\" was about the political climate and music industry colliding in the 70s, \"Short Cuts\" is about the moral climate of 90s Los Angeles.

People's daily stories always intersect in ways, which cannot be seen or understood, but if we could look at these stories what would we see? This is what Robert Altman's film Short Cuts wrestles and struggles with. If we could watch human's lives what would we feel? Sadness? Loneliness? Joy? \r\n\r\nBased off of Raymond Carver's short stories. Short Cuts tells the tale of 22 different Los Angeles resident's lives. Using an intertwining plot structure throughout the film these people go to clubs, clean pools, paint, raise children, cheat, drink, and sometimes run into each other. Literally, when Doreen, a waitress, runs into little Casey with her car, she forever changes his and his parent's lives forever. These different stories are sad, funny, and even devastating, but they truly depict the disparity of human life while pointing out the common threads that every one shares. \r\n\r\nThe problems of humanity are displayed with udder honesty. Altman doesn't give us an answer here, but simply presents us with the \"short cuts\" and lets us question them ourselves. We wonder why a mother would rather drink down her sorrows than show appreciation for her daughter? Why would a woman continually bring her young child into to her relationship problems? And why do spouses feel the constant need to hide things from their partners? \r\n\r\nOne particular story in Short Cuts finds the parents of their very recently passed away son confronting  a baker who had gotten angry when they had not picked up the cake they had ordered. The cake was ordered for their son's birthday party, which he never got the chance to celebrate. Upon hearing the news the baker's anger quickly  turns to encouragement. \"Eating's a good thing at a time like this,\" the baker says as he brings them freshly baked muffins comforting them with the best thing he can offer, food. \r\n\r\nMany of the other stories in Short Cuts also lead us up to a remedying ending like with the baker, but many of them fail to adequately finish. Short cuts gives us the build up for what we think will be a satisfying ending, but some of the stories leave you asking for a little bit more closure. For times sake some of stories' endings seemed to have been finished too quickly, and it is for this where Short Cuts slightly misses the mark.\r\n\r\nIt is easy for a film where plots happen at the same time to become overwhelming and confusing, but Short Cuts never comes across that way. The diverse plots easily start back up from where they left off continuing the story. We see the tragedies life can bring along with the joys, and Altman guides us expertly through the mess safely bringing us to the end, even if it seems slightly unfinished.",

Critiquing modern society, marriages, infidelity, and more, Short Cuts is a film with a ton of moving pieces, courtesy of a variety of storylines. Each storyline and set of characters interacts with others in very natural ways that link their stories. Above all, it really shows how flawed we all are and the fragility, mistrust, and lies, that permeate modern day marriage. Through these vignettes, it quickly becomes clear that Altman has a very cynical opinion towards modern day marriage and people's ability to remain faithful to their spouse and not act in their own self-interest.One of the best portions of this film is the acting. With such a large cast, obviously there are a lot of terrific actors and boy do they every display it in this film. Leading the way is Julianne Moore. As an eccentric artist who largely paints nude women, she portrays Marian Wyman. Married to Dr. Ralph Wyman (Matthew Modine), she and Modine share one of the best scenes in the film. Confronting his wife about an event three years ago when he believes she cheated on him, the moment is intense and incredibly powerful. Moore's performance in this moment really hits a fever pitch of intensity and emotional rawness that define her character. She is very open throughout and even does this scene without her pants, which really shows what makes her character tick. She is raw and a passionate person and Moore really captures this brilliantly, especially in this moment. Alongside her, Jennifer Jason Leigh is often scene stealing here. Appearing as Lois Kaiser, a married mother of two who is a sex line worker, one of the funniest encounters of the film is her talking dirty to a customer, which upsets her husband. Wondering why she does not talk to him like that, her reaction to this apparent absurdity and comical reaction to her work is hysterically put together, bolstered by Leigh's performance.Yet, what is really impressive is the writing. Thinly plotted, the film is never anything less than engrossing. It keeps you fully engaged and entertained throughout because of the writing. The characters are nuanced, with most of them being neither fully good or bad. They all act, talk, and walk like real people. Robert Altman introduces a variety of characters and uses them brilliantly to explore the state of marriage and the turmoil that ensues. Issues regarding infidelity, different desires, lack of passion, death of children, and depression, all ensue and are beautifully depicted. The acting helps here, as it is all very grounded and authentic, but the writing is really what creates this impact. Instead of introducing storylines and dropping them, Altman delves into them and shows them from varying perspectives. In one relationship, a man cheats. In another, the woman cheats. How is the dynamic different? This is explored in Short Cuts, as well as other marital issues that can arise. All are given the heft and weight they demand, which is a real treat to watch unfold.For a three hour long film, Short Cuts honestly feel quite short. Its acting and writing is so engrossing, it never slacks. Compared to Altman's past film of this type, Nashville, it is hypnotic. While Nashville is a great film, it does sometimes feel its length. Short Cuts, however, is streamlined and consistently powerful. That said, the comparisons to Nashville are apt as they are not just Altman films, but both use music in interesting fashions. Through Tess Trainer (Annie Ross) and her singing in a club, which brings a few characters into the bar, we hear songs such as \"To Hell with Love\" or \"Prisoner of Life\". Thematically, these are great fits as the film largely explores the pain that can come from marriage and the problems that arise. Yet, having a spouse and kids, as most of the characters do, can leave one feeling trapped and stuck with their current way of life, even if its unhappy. This is a constant in Altman's films and Short Cuts is hardly an exception as, though he explores dark themes here, it is done through music and the musical choices accentuate the thematic excursions.A poetic and moving look at life, marriage, and death, the film explores issues that can arise once we are married. The animosity, loss of passion, or infidelity, that plagues modern marriages are on full display in Short Cuts with brilliant writing and acting to boot, which does its sensitive subject tremendous justice. Honestly, this is as near to a masterpiece as I have seen in my mild binge on Robert Altman in the past few weeks.",

Short Cuts? Is it even Altman's best work? Well, everything unique and original in the other movies on this list was done before... by Altman. (Is there anything the man hasn't tried?) And everything Altman achieved in his career can be summed up in Short Cuts.\r Five of the entries on my list are genre intact: gangster, war, bio, sci-fi, adventure. Lynch is a genre of his own (a master of hook and subvert), Pulp Fiction is pomo-noir with a swagger, Tree of Life, an audacious and transcendent poem, Boyhood, literally an epic achievement of dedication and commitment. Short Cuts doesn't seem to fit in as it is merely an observation of lives and love. But what observations! What lives! What heartbreaking affection. All underscored with a resonating heartbeat patching into so many paths, teetering on the brink of disaster and threatening to explode, which it does, in the form of a climactic planetary stroke. Nothing brings people together quite like a natural disaster. An earthquake, tremoring just enough to inform us of our place in history on the cosmic map. Enough to bring us down to earth, reboot our egos, and put multiple perspectives in perspective. Enough to appreciate the simple state of being.\r A larger-than-life baroque master is at the helm, warbling out contrapuntal narratives and swirling themes orchestrated to perfection. Multiple story-lines wavering under one very singular umbrella. And under Altman's protective cover the talent runs free and easy, playful and experimental, ironic and sincere. The key characters in one story become walk-throughs in another, paradoxically tethered and disconnected from the self, from family, community, and life. Boundaries are crossed and souls get lost. We're all the same if only by not knowing what our needs are or why we're even here. With nothing to say except everything is exceptional, infinite and empty. And life is short. Shorts Cuts of scenes stories words actions desire love loss lies lust faith wonder and devotion. Heck, I'd see it again only to watch Tom Waits and Lily Tomlin shack up.\r Some movies claim to be infinitely entertaining, some maintain they can be viewed repeatedly without losing their initial charm, some insist they never age, I know only one that can lay claim to all such conceits. Short Cuts is like falling in love. It delivers quietly, wonderfully, naturally, tenderly, simply and deeply.",
