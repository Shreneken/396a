            "content": "For a film about mourning, there are two moments in Krsyztoff Kielslowski's THREE COLORS: BLUE that seem divorced of anything that is happening at first glance. Both are seen through the impersonal medium of a television. The first occurs early in the film: as she recovers from an automobile accident which claimed the life of her husband, composer Patrice de Courcy, and her daughter Anna, Julie is given access to witness their funeral, but as she turns the channel, there is an image of a man bungee jumping. It will be seen again when Julie visits her mother (played by Emmanuelle Riva) who lives in a home, disconnected from the outside, watching television. This image of a person seen in free-fall against a pale blue sky (blue is indeed prominent in this film) seems to mirror Julie quite well: her loss has given her an empty outlook on life. She wishes to do 'nothing', to just exist, divorced from human contact. However, that same cord which is a life-preserver will eventually pull her back.It's the slow but sure pull of the cord that Kieszlowski wants to tell in this beautiful but tragic story. In Juliette Binoche he has found his muse. With that face that expresses a complex set of emotions and her internalized body language that at times threatens to break through outbursts (as when she plays a piece of the concerto for the unification of Europe her husband was creating and suddenly slams the piano, or when she leaves her house carrying only a box and almost mauls her first against a stone wall). She cannot feel and is trying to make herself do so, but realizes it is better to just be, without ties, love, meaning.BLUE is filled, almost drenched, in subtle meaning which grows stronger at every frame. Kieslowszki's bungee cord begins to make its presence at every subsequent scene. The box Julie is seen carrying contains a mobile which formed a blue sphere -- her only link to her daughter. The musical score, which in one scene she had ordered destroyed, makes its appearance in none other than the streets of Paris under the sad flute of a deadbeat who says, \"We all must hold onto something.\" People inevitably come into her life -- for what reason we aren't told up front, but there is the feeling of matters left unresolved and new elements which will force Julie to come full circle and finally open herself to herself.There are three sequences in which Julie immerses herself in water. Water allows herself to go under, to dive into what she has been avoiding for some time now. In one scene, she is seen in a fetal position as if this is a return to her primal state of floating -- free-fall -- and is \"safe\". However, the next-to-last time she swims she is confronted by her new friend and neighbor Lucille (Charlotte Very) who is an exotic dancer working in the red-light district in Paris (note the implicit link to RED) and then she, and we, hear the noise of little children who all jump into the pool dressed in reds and whites which make her instinctively recoil and maybe cry. After all, this is an oblique reference to Anna and she may not be ready for this kind of information. The memories come back (even when we do not see them) and even correlate to a decision to have a neighbor's cat kill a litter or mice in her apartment because she needs complete aloneness.But this will not happen: there are still serious matters which she is about to discover and Lucille, the least involved person in Julie's tragedy but whose progressive insinuation into Julie's life, similar to Valentine's reaching out to the old judge in RED, will be the link to facing them.Music is also an important part of BLUE, and whenever Julie is about to make a decision that will take the story to the next level we hear the haunting Preisner score which permeates the entire movie as its soul. American films don't seem to give music such a prominent position in a film, quite possibly because there is always the element of consumerism that is at the heart of every movie -- even serious films. European films, I've noticed, have a different approach to storytelling. BLUE is a very oblique mystery contained within itself from WHITE and RED, but one that demands listening to as well as subsequent views: it opens and reveals its petals very slowly and contains a surprise at the center of its bud, one that again, American film-makers would not have known how to resolve unless there was some form of catharsis and maybe even violence. Not here: for a movie that gives music and its relation to a truly spellbinding mystery, BLUE and its score are stunning, particularly at its climactic sequence where all of the people Julie has crossed paths with are seen in one last, flowing shot -- Emmanuelle Riva's being the most emotional, seen reflected twice in what can only be a haunting death scene, or is it? -- and returns, full circle, to another reflection of Julie, and Julie herself, open, and weeping in an enigmatic, Mona Lisa smile, free at last.",

            "content": "Instead of saying which is the best and worst (though have often heard 'Red' cited best and 'White' the weakest, though all three films are generally very highly thought of) of Krzysztof Kieslowski's \"Three Colours\" trilogy, it will just be said that all three films in the trilogy are must-watches in their own way.The first film in the trilogy 'Three Colours: Blue' serves as a very poignant exploration of grief and liberty (in the emotional sense), and to me it is one of the most moving and interesting depictions of grief and liberty in film. It is heavily symbolic, with its intricate use of music, the dominant use of the colour blue in the colour palette, its interesting use of fade outs (though actually different to their usual use, representative of time standing still rather than it passing or a scene conclusion), links to the main character's past (here the use of falling) and the bottle recycling, but not in an incoherent sense.Visually, 'Three Colours: Blue' looks stunning. The whole film is shot with aesthetic grace and elegance and while the use of blue is dominant for symbolic reasons it is never gimmicky or cheap. Kieslowski's direction is thoughtful and never intrusive, and the intricate music score and the symbolic way it's utilised (representing Julie's struggles with isolation) is inspired, \"Song for the Unification of Europe\" is one of the most emotional tracks of music in any film seen by me recently.Story-wise, 'Three Colours: Blue' challenges in a way but also always engages, mainly because of how movingly and intensely it deals with the tragic story of Julie and its themes of grief and liberty. The pacing is deliberate but never hits a dull spot.One of 'Three Colours: Blue' is the astonishing performance from Juliette Binoche, an intensely affecting portrayal that ranks high up with her best performances. All the cast are fine, particularly Beno\u00eet R\u00e9gent and Emmanuelle Riva, but in the acting stakes this is Binoche's film.All in all, a beautiful, thought-provoking and moving film, and a wonderful start for a very interesting trilogy of films. 10/10 Bethany Cox",

            "review_title": "Three Colors: Memory",
            "content": "How do we know what it is, essentially, that we liked about a movie? Which is to say, what do we come to know about this viewer who was affected? And what do we say of that experience, do we ascribe it outside of us? No, that's just a bunch of words.This is what we have here, questions of memory and meaning. A woman as viewer of a movie taking spontaneous shape around her (played by Binoche as placid observer), that pokes holes in herself and provokes questions; finally overcoming it by being pulled forward by what was left incomplete in it.A woman who has lost everything as the film begins, every anchor in her life violently removed in one swoop and she's now cast adrift. We have the whole film as her own inner drift through an interminable flow. Kieslowski evokes this with lush dissonance between visual segments, cuts and fades that leave life in suspense. There is scant story, all about living with these fragments. Music erupts around her in sudden intervals; but music that's coming from inside of her and being hallucinated.It's the world of memory and inner life. Tarkovsky enters this with long, mystifying sweeps of the camera that lift bearings and slip into dreams and ruminations. Kieslowski by contrast caresses their outline, the surface of emotions as they glide over the eyes. It's not difficult like Tarkovsky or Ruiz can be, but pleasant in the way of Kar Wai. It goes down rather easy, you can see it for just the surface shift.Kieslowski had spent the whole 10 hours of the Dekalog training this ability to dream in advance. It pays off here. Each of the 10 Dekalogs was about a narrative that an earth-shattering revelation comes along and creates a change in viewing. You will see this here obviously. But Dekalog had a contrast; some of it was Kieslowski opening corridors in the imagining with his camera, most was characters stumbling into revelations and articulating feelings. Here I'm happy to note this tension is resolved in favor of the eye; the whole is about visual slippage through cracks in story.He lets blue lights shine on screen as music soars in crescendos, he gives us closeup shots of eyes; the eye that colors. At other points he introduces memory as images before a viewer: the funeral playing on a screen, images of her husband on TV that when shuffled through reveal a mistress. Most eloquently, images on TV of someone being cast over a void with a bungee chord as her anxiously precarious drift with nowhere to hold. She's fading from even the mind of her mother.For the end he reserves a tableaux of joined moments from lives as they are suspended briefly in mind. It's all being endlessly relived and combined like the music she works to complete with her composer friend. The music is central here.Not just as the memory of what was collaboratively lived with her composer husband, the emotion that was absorbed and now erupts again, but also as the sheet where an incomplete piece beckons for the work of continued imagination. The shot of this sheet as scribbled notes end and lines stretch interminably is the abstract heart at the bottom of it.Had another woman not made a copy of the score, it would have disappeared when she burnt it. Had she come by to pick up the photos of her husband, she might have burnt them with everything else and never found out about the mistress. But it's all this what eventually pulls her out of herself.",

            "review_title": "Perfect attention to detail - (with SPOILERS)",
            "content": "Krzysztof Kieslowski's \"Blue\" is a film that appears, at first glance, to have a very simple story and almost no plot.  The film is about Julie (Juliette Binoche), who after losing her husband and daughter to a car accident must learn to cope with their deaths.  But the real story revolves around the process of liberation from her past.  Kieslowski illustrates this process with complex visuals, implementing an interesting use of light and shadow, as well as colors, to create an atmosphere that reflects the feeling of this piece perfectly.There is a certain degree of multiple meaning in the use of colors in Kieslowski's \"Three Colours\" trilogy, aside from creating an appropriate mood for each part of the trilogy; the colors also represent the blue, white, and red of the French flag.  The three colors stand for liberty (blue), equality (white), and fraternity (red).  Liberty, or freedom from the past, is a major theme in \"Blue\", the first part of the trilogy.  The Juliette Binoche character, Julie, goes through a personal journey, as she must cope with her husband and daughter's deaths.  She must go on with life even though the worst has happened, and she chooses to be free, to become liberated.The color blue is used regularly from beginning to end.  The film starts with a shot of a candy-wrapper moving in the wind; it is colored blue on one side.  The street, the car, and even the air seem to be tinted in a hue of blue.  The last shot before the final montage is of the sparkling blue crystal lamp hanging above Julie's flat.  Throughout the film blue is used extensively, there is a trace of it in practically every shot of the film, everything from people's clothes, the color of ink, the paint on walls and arches, the tint of the street and the water, etc.  The blue is used \"to create moods of melancholy and coldness, and to draw attention to the resonant emotional associations conjured up by objects and places in Julie's mind.\" (Andrew, p. 25)  The coloring perfectly reflects the mood of the film; it presents a very dismal and hopeless atmosphere full of solitude and melancholy, giving the viewer a visual insight into Julie's mind.The several scenes in the swimming-pool are some of the most powerful moments in the film, \"there's aching dimension in the bluish swimming-pool water she regularly immerses herself in\" (Howe), and it is especially evident in the shot following Julie's recollection of her husband's last words.  In this scene Kieslowski implements an interesting use of light and shadow.  The shot begins in the water, Julie's entire body is submerged, and the only color visible in the frame is blue: the water is blue, her body is blue, the surrounding walls are blue, and even the shower door is blue. The camera pans as she moves from one side of the pool to the other.  Then, as Julie lifts herself out of the water, a reddish ray of light covers the upper half of her body, while everything else seems to be hidden behind a blue-tinted shadow; it is as if the essence of life itself is shining its hopeful light on her.  But she can not handle it; she is not yet ready for liberty.  Slowly she lowers her body back into the water, returning once again into the atmosphere of the oppressive blue until she is completely submerged in the pool, her grief now as clear as the bluish water surrounding her.Another fascinating element about Kieslowski's films is the attention that is paid to details, especially when it comes to expressing one of the most difficult elements to capture on camera: human emotion.  Every glance, every reaction is rich with meaning, there is no close-up throughout the film that is unnecessary.  Kieslowski works very well with the actors, especially Juliette Binoche, who gives one of the most impressive performances of her career in \"Blue\".  One can see the grief on her face, but it is a very cold grief, more than in any of her other films Binoche gives the impression that her character in \"Blue\" is undergoing a complex state of thought.There are a few shots in the film that seem to be unrelated to the story. This is yet another technique often used by Kieslowski to heighten the intellectual capacity of his films.  Whenever creating any series of films, Kieslowski liked to link each respective part of the series with certain characters or actions, and this is true on several levels of the \"Three Colours\" trilogy.  Beside the fact that the court scene of \"White\" is actually a short part of \"Blue\", and the fact that the characters from all three films appear at the end of \"Red\", there is a very interesting shot of an old woman that is presented in the same way in every part of the trilogy. It's a very simple shot, but it says a lot.  An old woman, so old that she can barely walk, walks slowly towards a recycling container.  She reaches up so high that she can barely reach to throw a bottle into the container, and then once again she takes her bag and slowly walks away.  It is as if Kieslowski wanted to represent life's struggle, and indeed the different struggles of the characters of his trilogy, with this little old woman's struggle with the recycling container.Also seemingly unrelated were several shots of people bungee jumping juxtaposed with a dialogue between Julie and her mother.  \"Before I was happy.  I loved them.  They loved me, too.\" says Julie, just as a shot of a man jumping from a helicopter begins.  The fall seems to symbolize her desperation perfectly, yet it is also a symbol for the film's theme of liberation, for although the shots of the bungee jumpers all end just before it, the entire point of the bungee cord is to stop the fall and to pull the jumper back up, perhaps not to the same height, but up again never-the-less. It is like Julie's plunge into the bluish darkness of hopelessness after her tragedy, yet there exists the opportunity for liberation, for her to be pulled back up and to put the past behind her.Music is a large part not only of the story of \"Blue\", but Kieslowski actually worked with composer Zbigniew Preisner to make it a part of the film.  There are more than a few parts in the film where music is essential in creating the effect of the scene.  \"Kieslowski suggests the music's almost supernatural provenance by showing Julie first dozing in a chair with an unexplained blue light playing over her face, then, having been woken by the music, looking started and mystified toward the camera (which not only draws back from her and then returns, but bathes the scene in a blue wash), as if the music itself were a (blue?) physical presence.\" (Andrew)  When Julie first starts remembering the tune to the music to the \"Song For The Unification Of Europe\" the music plays in several brief flashes, and each time it plays Kieslowski creates a visual lens flare effect, which is of course colored blue.  In the scene where Olivier shows Julie his version of the music the audio and video simultaneously lose clarity: each time Julie makes a change to the manuscript, removing instruments from the composition one by one, the camera goes out of focus until only the string instruments are left and the camera is completely unfocused.  The ending sequence is another example, for the first time in the film the audience hears the complete chorus and as the tension builds and we finally hear the choir portion the camera tilts up to Julie's glittering blue crystal lamp, a shot which is followed by the powerful chorus and complete darkness.  This effect of juxtaposing darkness with music is something that occurs several times throughout the film, Kieslowski uses this technique to represent the intensity of emotion running through Julie's head.  When the character Antoine asks Julie if she wants to know what he saw at the time of the accident, she answers simply \"no\", then the screen blacks out and music begins, a few seconds later the black ends and we are returned once again to Julie and Antoine's conversation.It's a shame that more directors do not undertake more ambitious efforts such as the work of Krzysztof Kieslowski.  His films often do not rely on conventional plot elements, in fact, often times there is no real plot at all, yet somehow he was able to make his films both intellectually stimulating and interesting to watch.  In \"Blue\", Juliette Binoche's character, Julia, must learn to cope with her family's death.  She wants to put her past behind her, yet she is drawn into the past because of her husband's unfinished composition.  Does she even want the composition finished?  Was the music originally her husband's, or was she the real composer?  Kieslowski was not interested in answering these questions, he preferred to leave them uncertain.The film is, instead, about the process of Julie's liberation from her memories.  \"For Kieslowski, subtlety is a religion. He hints or implies -- anything to keep from laying his cards on the table. With \"Blue,\" you never feel he's shown his whole hand; not even after the game is over\" (Hinson). There is no happy ending here, and there is no real solution to the puzzle; the final shot is of Julie's tear-stained face, as it slowly loses opacity to an image of something blue on the frame behind it.  She makes the decision to be liberated from her past; hence it's a hopeful ending, yet the tear represents a struggle that is never really over.",

            "content": "The subject(mourn,lost)is so interesting and profound that this film is a real treasure. It is very difficult to write about 'Bleu' because this film has so many intense scenes,with many details.Juliette  Binoche's vulnerability is in every scene, every gesture, every moment. She plays an enigmatic woman,'Julie,' we're witness to her terrible loss(her husband who was a famous composer and her daughter died in a car crash)She is the survivor,not only of the accident,but of herself too.The film doesn't show us how her life was before the tragedy,but' Bleu' focuses on her personal journey to healing. Julie seems stoic,she did not criy hysterically or stay in bed totally depressed,her grief is intimate and touching.In one scene when Julie is near the blue crystal mobile(which belonged to her daughter) just notice her reaction.Another poignant scene is when Julie is in that swimming pool,suddenly,she stops and she can hear her husband's symphony(all in her head). Bleu also approaches a philosophical question-when you lose everything  can you start all over again?,life is a series of events and choices,Julie moves to another place from the country to a city.She did not want to see her friends,she wants to be alone but is this possible?,her past will haunt her. Another interesting aspect of this film is the use of music instead of dialogue,her silence is a reference of her terrible loss and pain,she is not depressed but sad. Also the meaning of the unfinished symphony of her husband is very profound (is connected with her grief and healing) The photography of the film and the beautiful and delicate face of Binoche contribute to the impact of  BLEU. Kieslowski was one of the most talented directors, I really admired his 'Trois couleurs' trilogy but I think,'Bleu' was his most powerful film.10/10",

Kieslowski, with his background in non-fiction film making, is applying the french political value of liberty to a personal situation.  He is, in essence, studying the human condition through fiction. The meaning of \"liberty\" takes on a very different meaning for Julie in this film.  She tries to gain liberty from her memories and her emotions only to find that it is an impossible task.  This is not a film to casually throw on after supper.  This film requires a commitment by the audience to really consider Kieslowski's implications, for he is telling us (throughout this trilogy) what he thinks makes a \"good\" person.  The score is beautiful and has a character of its own in the plot.  A must see for true film lovers but perhaps a little too much for someone expecting a casual encounter.",

It is a story of coping with grief, with characters fleshed out through facial expressions rather than words and actions, and Binoche is a fine choice for the lead. The intriguing music score and fade-to-black editing provide the film with an interesting sensation, in particular alongside the cinematography and lighting, used cleverly to keep things in and out of focus. Kieslowski also plays with sound in an interesting manner, and it is hard to flaw the film on anything. We are told nothing of the background of our protagonist, the supporting characters at times appear haphazardly thrown around, and yes, there is a lot of meandering and not much story, but this surely depicts the state of mind of the protagonist.

They know something of pain, and they have a stronger vision of beauty than anyone - one which extends to even pain having beauty. And not just any notion of beauty, but a sublime beauty.The most important development in film in 50 years was the development of noir. True noir takes the direction of the story away from the writer, away from anything that makes sense, and places the story as it unfolds in the hands of a capricious fate. It added another layer to the folding of narrative, one above the layer of the viewer and author and two above that of the movie.But noir is black, or was. With these films, our genius explores what colored noir would be like... what a world would be like under an ineffable drive to recover the past. Parallel pasts, hers and his. Other films in the trilogy dealt with tougher challenges: Red as parallel presents; White as parallel futures.That business about the French flag is no more a skeleton for these than the old woman recycling glass. I'm astonished that anyone would believe that.So this is colored noir, and necessarily beautiful - in fact part of the pain is the entanglement with the sublime. This could be the most beautiful film ever made. All in the eye which frames the thing.Binoche understands that she is not inventing a character, but a representative of life - someone who blends into the motion of the film.

There is practically no external conflict after that, except for the rather uninteresting point of will Juliete Binoche finish the score for the \"Unification of Europe\" song. To tell the truth, I really, really did not care one way or the other. Without plot narrative, we're left with some quite striking cinematography, mainly shots of Juliete which should definitely be in a slick fashion magazine. There's some nice montage of images and sounds a la Godard or Bertolucci, but nothing very memorable except for a sugar cube dissolving and some baby mice. This leaves me in the distinct minority of those who found the film cold and boring. I realize that the director Krzysztof Kieslowski was dying of aids when he made this film, but I can't transfer my sympathy for him to the film. I haven't seen the other two films in the trilogy. I hope they are better. I'm also upset with the false advertising on the DVD which calls the film \"Mysterious and Sexy.\" There is no mystery here and one shot of Juliete Binoche's naked back and several shots of her swimming in a bathing suit hardly qualifies a film as sexy. Of course, if they had written the truth \"Morbid and Pretty\" who would buy it?",

It's easy to see why. I can't imagine Bleu without Juliette \u0096 its not just that she lends her personality to the film\u0085Bleu IS Binoche.\u0095 I was thrown off by the sub-plots of the character's relationships with her mother and the striptease dancer, as I was about the seeming resolution at the end of the film. There were perhaps references that I missed but the \u0091almost happy' ending left me feeling un-relinquished. Given that I had shared such an intense journey with Julie, it seemed almost improper to accept that she would settle in to a normal relationship again.\u0095 Cinematography: The 1st shot of the film - that of a car tire racing - shot from the bottom of the moving car establishes this as \u0091not your typical movie'. The sequence-of-shots that follow eerily draw one into the compelling story-telling style of Krzysztof Kieslowski, minimalist in its approach, with a world communicated without dialogue in the first five minutes of the film. \u0095 Blue is not your typical art-house film. Its production values are up there with the best, and the cinematography by Slavomir Idziak (who's craft was recognized by Hollywood in Black Hawk Down), is nothing short of stunning. \u0095 The lighting is low key and soft, and wraps around the characters to create a mood of subtlety. A distinguishing feature is the detail in the shadows. None of the close-ups fully illuminate the protagonist, almost hinting at her vulnerability at facing the light, though the delicate use of eye-lights does well to bring alive her emotions. \u0095 The camera, an intelligently used narrative element, interacts with Julie and partakes in her emotions, respecting them and yet accentuating their intensity as she plods on in an alien world of deep personal purposelessness. The tight close-ups penetrate her soul and force us to delve into Julie's mind and share in her agony. \u0095 Editing: deftly uses match on action to create irony while forwarding the narrative. \u0095 Sound: The pace is hauntingly slow and silence has been used compellingly. It screams with meaning as it is becomes one of the more important elements as the narrative progresses. Bleu is not a film you can watch, consume and move on. Either you'll feel that you've totally wasted your time and will probably not be able to sit through (the pivotal occurrence is over within the first five minutes of the film without a single world being spoken, and the rest of the film is essentially the protagonist's psychologically subjective journey) or you'll realize by the time you've reached the end that you'll revisit this film at various points in time, explore and read about it, discuss it with people you respect, and try to get closer to the essence of Kieslowski. For there are two now well-accepted truths about the folklore surrounding Kieslowski, whose reputation continues to mount posthumously\u00851. that Kieslowski carefully interwove elements that were rich with meaning and social irony, and 2. that figuring those elements out and appreciating their implications is probably a lifelong learning process.",

I have found that some films (such as some of Bergman's) are too depressing to merit the high praise they receive. It's almost like to be considered a sophisticated, you have to love depressing and occasionally pointless films. I began to feel this way towards this film early on--thinking to myself \"oh, no,...another dreadfully depressing art film\". However, I was VERY pleased when despite the incredibly somber pacing, music and plot, the movie did not remained mired in misery and showed growth and change--and NOT in an overly idealistic or Hollywood way, either. Instead, the depression and existence of the lead, Binoche, seemed very real and I think this is the best of her films I have seen. In fact, I was a bit hesitant to watch the movie, as I was NOT a fan of two of her most famous films, The English Patient and The Unbearable Lightness of Being. These two films were also quite depressing and cold, but the movie Blue seemed to engage me more--perhaps because I could easily see myself or someone I love in Binoche's position following the deaths of her family.At first, she decides the best way to cope is complete denial and repression--forget about the past by extinguishing all memories--including selling all her possessions and running from her past life. However, despite her best efforts, she finds herself unable to completely keep out the past and is forced to deal with her husband's legacy (though the movie makes a mistake not to really address the death of Binoche's child very well).For psychology students, this movie is an excellent example of defense mechanisms (Freud) or the grieving process (Elizabeth K\u00fcbler-Ross).",

Of course isolating oneself from all others is not easy to do as the past keeps on popping up and the future holds many uncertainties. The fact that Binoche's husband had an affair and the woman is now carrying his child is both ironic and tragic for all involved.

He's obvious in his palette, using blue for sadness, red for life, and a general sepia wash for the anomie and observational phase of the movie.Yet to reduce a discussion of this fine movie to the technical tricks of the trade does no justice to its rich story, and the way everything in the world comes together to bring Miss Binoche to a realization of her own place in the world and her own nature. There are some startling realizations along the way, and Kieslowski and Miss Binoche are patient and deliberate in this portrait, teasing the audience into being interested in this character, who seems to be nothing without her husband and child, and desires to be nothing.

After seeing the whole trilogy and the DEKALOG, I'm convinced at Kieslowski's great talent, and his very early death was a true blow to world cinema.  Much like Kubrick but with a less ironic nature, Kieslowski loves to make his characters and stories both humanely distant, realistic, and, at the same time, philosophically idealist and dense.  I enjoyed BLEU more than BLANC (which was an odd machismic entry in a trilogy mainly focusing on women) but not as much as ROUGE, which I feel is one of the finest, most beautiful, most well-done films I've ever seen.More specifically, BLEU's focus seems to be on the relationship of a woman's loss of the tactile manifestation of her husband's existance with the ligering notions of his life - especially his music, which pervades the entire film, interrupting at key moments with a blackout and short blast of the overture.  To watch Julie struggle with her husband's abandoned secrets (including a mistress Julie befriends) is shattering, frustrating, and perplexing.Unfortunately, life must move, and, due to that, I can't watch BLEU over and over.  However, I did glean from one viewing the complexity of this picture, and recognize its need to be watched over and over, until Kieslowski's last gasps can be properly understood, which is all we can hope to return to a man whose genius was tragically cut short, but still stands as a giant in my view of cinema.",

I like the way that little things like mice in the apartment loom large in the thought of our main character, where as what others consider important such as finishing her husband's symphony seem very minor .It feels like diving deep through cold dark water to finally swim toward the light.

To me, \"Bleu\" is objectively not a very good film. The story is not that interesting, the characters are not that likable, the cinematography has its moments, but mostly the film has a dull look, and the music quite bad actually considering the importance of music to the plot. You look at your watch and keep going, thinking that it must get good at some point to justify all this lavish praise. But it never does.I think what is appealing to the critics and people who love this flim is that it is rich in symbolism and metaphors. Everything means something else. From reading Roger Ebert's gushing review, apparently there is even some \"meta\" symbolism at play in the larger scheme of the three film \"Three Colors\" trilogy. As clever as all this is, it didn't actually help me enjoy watching it any more than I did. The color blue motif that runs through the film comes across more hammy than clever.My partner remarked \"well, that was a waste of time\" after the film ended, and I can't help but feel the same way, even though I usually enjoy challenging films.

Due to the nature of the film, exposition in this case is not necessarily related to plot, but rather to the understanding of a human being.Kieslowski delves so deeply into the true nature of Julie (Juliette Binoche) and in such a remarkable way that by the end of the film we understand her utterly. Free from the clutter of dialogue and, for the most part, interaction with other characters we see Julie alone and in her most natural state. Kieslowski takes his documentary background and conveys his character in an almost voyeuristic manner. Showing Julie in anything but a state of solitude would be false; due to human nature Julie with Oliver would not be Julie, but rather a reflection of her true self which, although certainly interesting, pales in comparison to observing her silently struggle with the death of her husband and daughter alone.Kieslowski played with applying the documentary techniques, which he perfected in his early work, to the narrative form in The Dekalog with tremendous, although at times visually mundane, results. The Dekalog looks like a documentary. Here, he turns over much visual control to his Director of Photographer, Slawomir Idziak, with tremendously cinematic results. Idziak's use of color and light, combined with his groundbreaking filter work, serve to further explore Julie's character. Blue feels like a documentary and looks like a dismal Rembrandt. While Kieslowski concentrates on showing the true nature of Julie through action, Idziak contributes by showing her through light and color.Trois Couleurs: Blue is an almost unmatched achievement in the history of cinema.

Without giving anything away, the story centres on the life of a young woman who experiences a great loss, and how everything changes, how she reacts, what happens next and much more. Music plays a central part in the plot and the scene where her finger traces the score as she shapes the symphony for Europe, is unforgettable. As you watch it you are lulled by the music yet also aware of the tension between her lover and her. Simply put, this film is subtle and moving, beautiful to watch, has a haunting musical soundtrack (I bought the CD as well, I have to say) and is never sentimental or cliched, not for a minute.

            "content": "This is the first film in Polish director Krzysztof Kie\u015blowski's Trois couleurs trilogy based on the French Revolutionary ideals of liberty, equality, and fraternity. The high point is S\u0142awomir Idziak's sumptuous cinematography and when all is said and done, 'Blue' is a fine film to look at. But in terms of story, it's also a slow-moving affair and if you don't have a lot of patience, you might find the narrative an exercise in unfortunate ennui.Juliette Binoche plays 'Julie' whose famous composer husband and young daughter are killed in a car accident at the beginning of the film. Totally shattered, Julie first attempts suicide but can't go through with it. Instead, she decides to withdraw from life by putting up her home for sale, place her Alzheimer's afflicted mother in a nursing home and renting an apartment in Paris without telling any of her friends and family. She also destroys her husband's unfinished musical score (commissioned to promote European unity), which she may have actually composed herself.The main question we're left with (as robot-like Julie makes her way through her self-imposed life in exile) is, when will she come out of it? Along the way, however, she's determined to prove that she can go through life with all her emotions deadened, as a sort of impotent protest against the cruel fate bestowed upon her. Hence, when Olivier, a former composer colleague who's in love with her, finally finds out where she's moved to, Julie has sex with him and then cruelly tells him never to see her again. And then there's all those scenes swimming in the pool\u2014we hear the booming sound of the unfinished symphony impinging on Julie's consciousness. This obviously signifies her inability to repress her emotions completely.Kie\u015blowski argues that in the mourning process there comes a point where demands for kindness in ordinary life must intrude on the mourner's determination to maintain their inflexible stance of anger and denial. Case in point: Julie answering exotic dancer's Lucille's call for help when her father shows up at the strip club. Or Julie deciding not to hold a grudge against Sandrine, her husband's mistress, by allowing her and the new baby, to live in her family's home. While Julie probably is still not overjoyed by Sandrine's actions, this is her way of 'moving on', and also acknowledging that she must help the baby, which belongs not only to Sandrine, but to her late husband as well.Julie finally breaks out of her shell by getting involved with Olivier. At the denouement, Olivier gives Julie the ultimatum about the unfinished score (a copy turns up preserved)\u2014he'll complete it with all its 'roughness' or Julie will take over completely, but admit to current and past authorship. But Julie's decision is ambiguous in terms of who takes credit\u2014what's important is that she's involved in collaborating and is no longer alarmingly self-absorbed. As the presumed completed symphony plays, we see shots of the various individuals who Julie touched, in spite of her self-defeating but thankful short-term exile. And the housekeeper who earlier cries for Julie because she's unable to mourn, can now rest assured that Julie is finally beginning to cry herself.Part of the 'Blue' problem is that there is no external conflict going on. The conflict exists solely in Julie's mind. The characters that impinge upon her are not developed in great detail\u2014they exist as a catalyst for Julie's recovery. There's also the natural tendency to feel sympathy for a character that has experienced an unfathomable tragedy. Nonetheless, Julie's recovery is rather predictable and I'm not convinced that explorations of the mourning process in itself, should really be the subject of a full-length feature film. On the other hand, if you're a patient film goer, the film's visual palate, is worth the price of admission.",

            "content": "I feel I've discovered something profound by learning of Krzysztof Kieslowski's trilogy of films in 'Three Colors'. It's virtually impossible to find a completely original concept in movies today, yet the Polish director has achieved something in his work that creates a long lasting impression. 'Blue' establishes it's theme of liberty through loss early in the story, as we follow the post-accident life of the picture's protagonist Julie Vignon (Juliette Binoche), as she tries to cope with the loss of a husband and young daughter. Julie goes to the extreme of selling off all her possessions and moving to the city where she can live alone and escape her memories, along with friends and lovers who no longer have any meaning for her. This life of self imposed solitary confinement will not last long, as the kind hearted young woman finds it impossible not to come to the aid of others in distress or turmoil. I found this to be a strangely fascinating film experience. The theme of 'blue' repetitively appears throughout the story - the blue room that Julie orders emptied at the family home, the crystal strands of the mobile she takes with her to the city, the blue lollipop and wrapper, and the swimming pool she takes laps in to relieve her innate stress at being alive. I'm wondering if there's some hidden symbolism with the pool; Julie never laps it lengthwise, she only swims from one side to the other. I was also very curious about the scene where Julie observes three (three again) thugs beating up a man who gets away and seeks refuge in her apartment building. One expects that she come to the man's aid, but instead she's locked out of her apartment for the night, and the man is nowhere to be found. This appears to be a Kieslowski trademark of introducing characters in his films that are unconnected to the main theme, and wind up superfluous to the story. Not exactly a maguffin or a red herring, but a uniquely different kind of creative touch that one doesn't experience in other movies. I began watching these films out of order, having already seen \"Three Colors:Red\", but not commenting on it until I've seen the director's 'Blue' and 'White' movies to see if there's a connecting thread. It seems implicit, while other reviewers make note of elements that come together by the final installment. Though 'Red' seems to stand alone well enough by itself with no recurring characters, I did pick up on a hint in 'Blue', and will have to see how the thread plays out. So more on that at a later time.",

            "content": "Shot in France with a French cast and a Franco-Polish crew, \"Blue\" (1993) is the first entry in the masterful Three Colors Trilogy that Polish director Krzysztof Kieslowski completed shortly before his untimely death in 1996. Each of the three films draws its title from one of the colors of the French flag. In \"Blue\" Kieslowski richly counterpoints the color's conventional connotation of grief with its emblematic meaning of \"liberty.\" After a devastating car accident claims the lives of her young daughter and her internationally renowned composer husband, the film's protagonist Julie (Juliette Binoche) finds herself unable either to deal with the profound pain of loss or, despite several aborted attempts, to commit suicide. She elects instead to distort the meaning of \"liberty\" by cutting herself off from all things connected to her happy domestic past and from all human relationships that might cause further pain. She empties her home of furnishings - including all but one key item that belonged to her daughter. She retrieves the last composition that her husband was working on (significantly entitled \"Concerto for European Unification\") and deposits it in a passing garbage truck. She summons and sleeps with her husband's associate, Olivier, who she correctly suspects has always carried a torch of unrequited love. As a test of her dispassion, Julie perversely uses the act of love making as one final gesture of disconnection, hoping also to prove \"just a woman\" to Olivier and not worthy of his continued pursuit and idealization. In the morning she deserts Olivier and her emptied country home for a leased room in Paris, where she plans to do nothing and live anonymously. On her way off the estate, however, we watch as Julie scrapes her knuckles along a stone wall until they bleed, suggesting that the pain of human existence and memory resides powerfully beneath her liberated surface. For some time while residing in Paris, Julie continues her self-imposed human exile, having little to do with her neighbors, focusing intently on the phenomena of the present (like a sugar cube dissolving in her morning coffee), and continuing to repress the feelings and memories symbolized by sudden bursts of orchestral music against a black screen. Inevitably, however, Julie's walled in isolation begins to crumble. Olivier finds her hiding place, a homeless man inexplicably plays fragments of the Unity Concerto on his flute, a young stripper who has been ostracized by all others in Julie's apartment building insinuates herself into Julie's life and re-awakens her memories by zeroing in on the blue glass mobile that hangs in Julie's apartment \u0096 the one object connected to her daughter that Julie was unable to abandon or destroy. Ultimately, two events combine to extract Julie from her psychological slough of despond and initiate the process of her re-engagement with the world. First, by a chance occasion paralleling the accident itself, she learns that her husband had been conducting a prolonged affair with a young law clerk and that the woman is carrying her husband's child. Initially stunned with betrayal, Julie angrily confronts the woman, but then her inherently generous nature surfaces and Julie invites her to take possession of the abandoned country estate. At about the same time, Julie learns that Olivier has undertaken to complete the Unification Concerto on his own, which - as he has counted on - arouses Julie's ire and provokes her into aiding Olivier with the project. As earlier intimated, it now becomes clear that she, not her husband, was the concerto's primary composer. Work on the concerto not only restores Julie's creative link to life but also sparks love and desire for the ever-faithful Olivier. The healing powers of love and music together are indicated by the lyrics of the concerto's chorus. Adapted from St. Paul's Letter to the Corinthians, they read: \"Though I have the gift of prophecy, and understand all mysteries, if I have not love, I am nothing.\" The film ends with a montage of images that weave an existential tapestry of chance and fate, love and isolation, life and death. The most memorable of these is a sonogram of the fetus pulsating in the mistress's womb, compensating imperfectly yet affirmatively for the loss of Julie's own child.Roger Ebert, in his original review of \"Blue,\" cited Ingmar Bergman's conviction that \"many moments in films can only be dealt with by a close-up of a face - the right face - and that too many directors try instead to use dialogue or action.\" Dialog and action in \"Blue\" are indeed sparse and obviously subordinated not only to close-ups on Juliette Binoche's extraordinarily expressive face, but to other purely cinematic film elements such as color, composition, camera placement, and \u0096 perhaps above all \u0096 sound. Indeed, \"Blue\" includes one of the most original and emotionally powerful diegetic soundtracks that I have ever encountered. Whether regarded as an independent entity or viewed in the context of the whole trilogy, \"Blue\" is a major work by one of the great masters of contemporary world cinema.",

            "content": "You could say the cinema is littered with great trilogies, some 'intentional', others accidental. However, there is no doubt that Krysztof Kieslowski intented \"Three Colours: Blue\" to be the beginning of a trilogy linked by the final moments of the third film and together they make one of the greatest trilogies in all of cinema. The colours are those of the French flag though you don't actually have to know that or indeed what they stand for to appreciate this great movie. Certainly, the first and third parts are masterpieces in their own right and if the middle one, \"White\" isn't quite a masterpiece it is still a remarkable piece of work.At the beginning of \"Three Colours: Blue\" a car accident claims the lives of a father and his five year old daughtter. His wife, (a superb Juliette Binoche), survives but is seriously injured. The man was one of the world's most famous composers, (and Zbigniew Preisner's brilliant score will testify as to why), though there are rumours that his wife may have written some, (if not all), of his music and Kieslowski's film deals with grief, anger and redemption all anchored in Binoche's performance.In this film, magnificenly photographed by Slawomir Idziak, blue is the colour that predominates; it seems to seap into every frame of the movie and becomes, both symbolically and literally, a character in itself. This was clearly the work of a great filmmaker in total command, both of his subject and his medium, hugely intelligent and very moving without a touch of sentimentality to be seen anywhere.",

Its is based on a tragedy by a car accident and the subsequent consequences on an affecting woman . Julia , Juliette Binoche, reshapes her existence after dieing her husband and their little young daughter . After surviving Julia , she has a feeling of grief and sells her properties and buys a flat in the city . She lives lonely but discovers a dark secret about her deceased husband , a former famous composer .First of a trilogy of films dealing with contemporary French society concerns how the wife of a composer deals with the death of her husband and child . This is a tragic film , a symphony of pain and filmed in enjoyable style , good sense and high sensitivity . Subtle details make for careful viewing but it is a rewarding watch and a visual treat . Being necessary to keep an eye on cinematographic use of the color blue . Magnificent acting by Juliette Binoche who makes a real tour-of-force , she relies on the internalized affection rather than overwhelming displays for expression . Good support cast as Benoit Regent and Florence Pernal ; both of them also make appearances on the followings . The picture has various subtle references about trilogy such as : At one point, we see Julie carrying a box which, as a close-up shows, has prominently written across it the word \"blanco\", Spanish for white; in the next shot we are looking at her from behind, and she pauses in the street as a man in blue passes her on her left and a woman in red passes her on her right , this is a reference to the structure of the Three Colours trilogy - blue, white, red, in that order, mirroring the French flag . During one swimming scene in the blue pool, children in red and white bathing suits run out and jump in the water . Colorful and evocative cinematography by Slawomir Idziak , it is essential to be understood the story . As well as the musical score , Zbigniew Preisner composes a rousing and impressive soundtrack . The 1994 Annual Cesar Awards , presented by the French Academy of Cinematographic Arts and Sciences, it is France's main national film awards, considered by many in France, and internationally, to be the French equivalent of the American Academy Awards gave two deserved Cesar to the best actress Juliette Binoche and the best film , for this above average film titled \u00a8Blue\u00a8 . Rating : Good , worthwhile watching . The picture was followed by \u00a8Trois Couleurs : Blanc\u00a8 , a bittersweet comedic story spiced with lasting love and vengeance , in which a bewildered Polish hairdresser is divorced by his disdainful French spouse and returning to his family in Poland when he decides to fake his death ; being starred by July Delpy and Zamachowski , including cameos by Juliette Binoche and Florence Pernal . And \u00a8Trois Couleurs : Rouge\u00a8 starred by Irene Jacob , Jean Louis Trintignat , Frederique Feder and cameos by protagonists in the earlier film , Juliette Binoche and Benoit Regent ; \u00a8Red\u00a8 is for fraternity in the Fench tricolor flag , dealing with emotional connections are mad between unlikely couples and director Kieslowski uses the ending to tie up loose ends .",

            "content": "Two tempting routes instantly manifest themselves for us after losing a loved one: wallowing in sadness forever and detaching oneself from life while being very much alive. Neither of them makes a logical sense. Logic aside, however, neither can spare us such an inexorable phase or get us out of it miraculously. Julie seems to have veered into the latter route in order to evade slipping down the abyss of the former. But grief must take its natural course, and suppressing it would result in truly dire circumstances at their worst scenario would be being imprisoned by depression, shrouding us metaphorically until a shroud takes its place quite literally.\"Now I have only one thing left to do: nothing. I don't want any belongings, any memories. No friends, no love. Those are all traps.\"Kieslowski incessantly tries to save her from such fate and draw her back to life once again. His camera lingers in extreme close-ups on Juliette Binoche's features to draw out of them a smidgen of the sadness Julie does her utmost to bury inside herself. Later on as Julie keeps pushing grief away in her quest of severing herself from the past, she finds herself drawn back to it as memories surround her everywhere and no matter how hard she tries to escape them. When she returns back to her home for the first time after the accident that cost the lives of her husband (a renowned music composer) and her daughter, she asks the gardener if he has emptied the \"blue\" bedroom, which implies her trying of getting rid of the past. She goes upstairs only to find a \"blue\"-beaded chandelier, that's likely belonged to her daughter, hanging over her, just like her memories of her daughter. Julie's journey of liberating herself, in one sense, from her past life becomes impeded with reminders of her two dears she lost. Furthermore, Julie's incomplete grief begets anger and irritability that put her mental state at stake. And as memories relentlessly haunt her, she ends up surrendering to them, literally having her head under (blue)water. However, blue gradually begins to mutate its symbolic significance as liberation takes on a totally different definition in Julie's mind. It's here where Zbigniew Preisner's score blossoms into a salvaging tool. There's one scene, in particular, that I found fascinating where Julie and her husband's colleague trying to complete her husband's unfinished manuscript. The shot is pulled out of focus until it becomes almost utterly blurred, forcing the viewer to hear the music playing inside of their heads as they orchestrate parts of it. It's still a liberation of the past, but one of letting go of it while maintaining, nay cherishing its memories instead of eliminating them. A liberation that thrives on a catharsis for all of Julie's repressed painful feelings, bringing forth her deepest sobs and setting her free.",

It seems this was a mistake. Three Colours Blue is exactly the kind of film that action loving Hollywood film fans so gleefully laugh about. After a promising opening it becomes very slow and very little happens throughout. This is probably because it concerns a woman coming to terms with the death of her husband and daughter in something approaching complete isolation, but that's no excuse for making something as thoroughly uninteresting as this. Things do start to liven up a bit towards the end with the introduction of the husbands secret lover, but this is topped off by possibly the most horrible closing scene of any movie ever - it seems to start with Juliet Binoche having sex in a glass box full of water, then goes through a roll-call of all the characters looking thoughtful and deep. Overall, while this is far more ambitious than Three Colours White it does not pull off a success. Sometimes you have to drop a little bit of the subtlety to include something an audience can actually enjoy and engage with.",

The subject is so close to the heart of all of us that anyone can relate to this, and it will have something to say to any audience member. This film isn't for everyone, and the painful topic of death and grief, not to mention the insistence on not providing any more light moments or relief than Julie gets, is not the only thing that may leave certain viewers unhappy with this. It is for people who love movies, and it is an intimate work of emotion. The editing is masterful, with subtle and effective use of sound. This has great cinematography, and it is never flashy. The acting is stunning for everyone involved; Binoche sheds every single speck of \"armor\", as far as feelings go, and allows herself to be extremely vulnerable(and again, there are those that will find it to be an excessive strain, though it is worth it). Every character is immensely well-written and entirely credible. The lead is thoroughly developed, as well. This has a marvelous plot. The dialog is realistic and genuine. There is a bit of disturbing content and brief sexuality(a little of which is unpleasant) in this. The DVD comes with 46 and a half minutes worth of informative interviews/featurettes and also trailers for the Colors Trilogy. I recommend this beautiful picture to anyone who thinks it possible for the medium to produce art. 10/10",

            "content": "\"Trois couleurs: Bleu\" (\"Blue\" in English) was the first entry in Krzysztof Kie\u015blowski's Three Colors trilogy. Named after the colors on France's flag, the trilogy focuses on stories involving France's national motto: Liberty, Equality, Fraternity. Kie\u015blowski said that \"Blue\" looks at emotional, rather than political, freedom, as Juliette Binoche's widow Julie is no longer bound by family life but can't fully escape her past. This continuing connection is embodied in the lamp of blue beads, and in the footage of bungee jumping (in which the cords become more apparent as the movie progresses, symbolizing evidence of a link to the past). Most importantly, there is the music: much like how music consists not of a single note but of harmony with other notes, Julie cannot stay isolated from the rest of the world. Thus it's an anti-tragedy: Julie's attempt to erase her past call into question whether love and freedom can coexist.This is the first Kie\u015blowski movie that I've seen, and I'm really impressed. His use of scenery and colors to tell the story mirrors Stanley Kubrick's style of filmmaking. Juliette Binoche won both a Golden Globe and a C\u00e9sar for her performance, as well as an award at the Venice Film Festival (all well deserved). As for the director, I hope to see the other entries in Kie\u015blowski's Three Colors trilogy, as well as his other works. It's too bad that he retired after finishing the trilogy and then died of a heart attack.",

Generally, I like French films and I saw the other two installments of this trilogy, that is, \"Red\" and \"White.\" I recall, however, that they were more interesting movies than this one, which frankly, isn't saying much. Yes, the score for \"Bleu\" was pretty good, but I wasn't moved by Juliette Binoche's performance as the grieving widow and mother nor drawn into the plot of the movie except on a superficial level. In fact, all the characters seemed shallow and uninteresting, including the lead. Repeatedly, I found myself becoming impatient with the slow pace of the story because nothing seemed to happen for considerable stretches. Perhaps another viewing would change my mind, but I have no interest in seeing the movie again and I don't believe my lack of interest was because everything in the film was so subtle and symbolic (as others mentioned) and I must be as sensitive as a piece of driftwood. All those lingering closeups on Binoche's face, I found ineffective and dull, at least partly because her face is not very interesting to me. Further, the tale does not adequately convey the sense of grief one feels in real life at the death of loved ones. Toward the end, Binoche became somewhat less stilted in her detached interpretation of an accident survivor, which I take to mean that she was emerging from her depressive state. What prompted this? Apparently, nothing more than the discovery that her dead husband had a mistress who was carrying his child. She became transformed by the news and suddenly wanted to share her house with the woman. Finally, she came to grips with the fact that she was the real musical genius in the family because she was able to finish off her dead husband's last symphony with ease and hand it over to her new love, his old collaborator. Talk of the director's brilliant reputation can't rescue this overblown effort. Other than the moving yet somewhat pretentious score, signifying European unity, and the visually arresting blueish scenes, I am underwhelmed. I wouldn't call it a lousy movie, simply not a very good one.",

Basically Julie (Golden Globe nominated Juliette Binoche) has lost her husband, an acclaimed European composer, and daughter in a car crash. Julie tries to start a new life free from personal commitments, belonging, grief and love. She basically cuts herself off from any real public appearance, staying anonymous in solitude, but people from her past and present life are intruding with their problems. However, with these people coming into her life she finds inspiration to create music, and she goes back to her normality. Also starring Beno\u00eet R\u00e9gent as Olivier, Florence Pernel as Sandrine and Charlotte V\u00e9ry as Lucille and H\u00e9l\u00e8ne Vincent. Bincohe is astounding in her performance, she was even willing to scrape her knuckles on that rocky wall for real. The use of the colour blue in most of the settings is very effective. It was nominated the Golden Globe for Best Original Score for Zbigniew Preisner and Best Foreign Language Film. Juliette Binoche was number 88 on The 100 Greatest Movie Stars, the film was number 33 on Film 4's 50 Films To See Before You Die, and along with the sequels, all three were number 77 on The 100 Greatest Films.

            "content": "\"Three Colours: Blue\" is the first part of Krzysztof Kieslowski's Three Colours trilogy, the other parts being White and Red. These are, of course, the colours of the French flag, and according to Kieslowski these three colours symbolise respectively liberty, equality, and fraternity, although this is not an interpretation that has ever officially been adopted by the French government.The central character is Julie, a young woman whose husband Patrice, a famous composer, and young daughter Anna are killed in a car accident. Julie herself is also involved in the accident, but survives without serious injury. Her way of attempting to rebuild her life is to cut herself off from everything she has known before. She sells the family's elegant country house and moves to a small flat in Paris. She distances herself from old friends, staying in touch only with her elderly mother, but this does not really count as a tie to the past because her mother, suffering from senile dementia, no longer recognises her. She destroys the unfinished score of the work her husband was working on at the time of his death.Cutting herself off from her past, however, proves to be more difficult than Julie had anticipated, especially after it emerges that a second copy of Patrice's score has survived and that his friend and fellow-composer Olivier Beno\u00eet intends to complete it. (The piece is always referred to as a \"concerto\", but the piece we actually hear, a setting for soprano, choir and orchestra of words from Saint Paul's first letter to the Corinthians, is not a concerto in the sense in which classical musicians would normally understand the term. Perhaps Olivier has radically altered Patrice's conception of the work). Julie also discovers that her husband had a mistress, Sandrine, who is pregnant with his child.So what has this story to do with liberty? Kieslowski was clearly asked this question himself, and his answer was that the film is not about political liberty (which is how the French revolutionaries would have understood the word) but about \"emotional liberty\", a rather more nebulous concept. Julie wants to free herself from all emotional bonds but finds that she is unable to do so. No man, and no woman, is an island.Besides being the supposed colour of liberty, the word \"Blue\" has some more literal meanings in this film. In keeping with the sombre theme Kieslowski uses a restrained palette with few bright colours; whites, greys, browns and dull blues and greens are the predominant hues. One of the few brightly coloured objects, however, is a mobile of bright blue beads, which is one of the few possessions which Julie keeps from her previous life and which presumably has some significant meaning for her. (It may have belonged to her dead daughter). Some scenes are also shot under blue light.For a film which deals with what must be among the most traumatic situations imaginable- a young woman suddenly and tragically losing her husband and her only child- the emotional temperature is always far too cool. Julie's attempt to cut herself off from her former life only makes sense if one interprets it not as callousness but as the only strategy she can think of to deal with her extreme grief, yet I never got much sense of this from Juliette Binoche's rather restrained performance. \"Three Colours: Blue\" is, technically and aesthetically, a well-made film, yet watching it again recently for the first time in many years reminded me why Kieslowski has never been among my favourite directors. 5/10",

So many scenes leave a lasting impression. The moments of her succumbing to masochistic tendencies in order to feel something, anything other than the unbearable despair over her loss, are absolutely wrenching.Kieslowski doesn't lean towards melodrama for a moment here, never allowing his audience to feel as though they are watching a film take place, but rather presenting such a lived-in study of this level of devastation a person can experience. Binoche is on point every step of the way, somehow being expressive to the audience while shutting herself off from everyone around her. She is my favorite actress in the history of cinema and this is a glowing example as to why; even when she's saying nothing she is saying everything. Her face is so expressive in the most subtle of ways and here she puts that to remarkable use.Of course even if this wasn't such an emotionally profound piece, it would still manage to be a treat for the eyes, with Kieslowski making full use of his color palette in impressively vivid ways. That final shot, a hold on Binoche's face as tears quietly stream down it, was one of the few things that I had remembered from my initial viewing of the film years ago and it's easy to see why; it's haunting.",

A film in which a composer and his (?) music figures prominently must make a better attempt to provide a convincing score. Binoche's portrayal of emotional deadness was not convincing, either. \"The Decalogue\" is a much greater work.",

            "review_title": "Freedom is an Illusion",
            "content": "Krzysztof Kieslowski's most famous films are his last. The three colors trilogy or film tricolor was very highly appreciated among critics and viewers. The series of three includes the films Blue, White and Red. After the last one, Red, Kieslowski announced that it was the best he could do and therefore retired. I don't believe, and I don't think even Kieslowski believed that Red was the best he could do. I bet he only wanted to get peace, by announcing that. To get out of the fame and media. Each of the colors have one main theme, but the same themes repeat in all films, for instance the paradox of freedom and love, which had been a leading theme throughout Kieslowski's work, culminates in The Three Colors. Blue - Freedom is about a woman who loses her husband and daughter. She is in a prison of love, she tries to move on, detach and become independent, but can't. The paradox of love and freedom: the woman wants to be free but can't because she is in love. \"People who think they're free are the least free of all.\" K. Kieslowski.A woman, Julie (Juliette Binoche) suddenly gets in a car accident with her husband and daughter. She tries to find solutions how to continue her life, and decides to escape their home. Since Julie's husband was a famous composer, the media and the people are very interested in her life. Julie's husband had started a new composition in celebration of the united Europe. But because of his sudden death, the composition remained unfinished. A friend of Julie and his husband decodes to try to get the composition ready. When he gets Julie to agree and help him, they begin to compose it as close to the original purpose as possible.Why The Three Colours Trilogy is so famous and appreciated is because the films are so multidimensional and full of many layers. Each of them have their own story and themes, but certain events, motives and themes combine them. Blue is about a woman, White as about a man and Red is about a man and a woman. That is the simplest way to look at them. But each of them have their leading themes: Blue / Freedom, White / Equality and Red / Fraternity. But of course all the films deal with plenty of other themes. In Blue among freedom Kieslowski deals with the difficulty of detachment and independence. It makes us wonder what is freedom? Can we ever actually get it? What is the freedom Julie seeks or receives from? This is of course what Krzysztof Kieslowski intended. He breaks many codes of narrative and traditional dramaturgy, but he certainly doesn't do that just to seem intelligent. He breaks the chronology and leaves many things opened, but if one pays attention one will figure them out.In addition to Blue's thematic beauty and depth it is technically perfect. Krzysztof Kieslowski's main composer, Zbigniew Preisner composed the music for Blue as he did for No End and all the subsequent films by Kieslowski. His score is always very beautiful, touching, emotional and important for the film, but in Blue it is especially important for the story. The film itself deals with music, because Julie's husband was a composer. Preisner, who hasn't ever studied music wrote a beautiful composition for the unification of Europe. In the end where we get to listen to the composition one could cry. Not only because of the sad story or the touching climaxes, but because of the true beauty in cinema. I burst out into tears, the music is so beautiful, so perfect and so profound. The lyrics are taken from The Love Chapter in the Bible. The song is such a beautiful piece which makes one understand the beauty of life but also remember the enormous pain belongs to it.There are several ways to interpret Blue, the events, the choices and the situations in it. The simplest way to understand Julie's choice would probably be to think that she had known that her husband had an affair for years. That is why the appearing of the mistress doesn't shock the audience as it doesn't Julie. But the theme score by Preisner, which plays every time someone talks about Julie's husband to her, gives many changes of different interpretations for the audience. For instance in the beginning a journalist asks Julie: \"Is it true that you composed all the compositions by your husband?\" No matter is the statement true, still Blue gives the audience a lot to decide, observe and think on their own.Krzysztof Piesiewicz the screenwriter was the third important man in Kieslowski's team. Kieslowski says in his interview, Kieslowski on Kieslowski that Piesiewicz is not much of a writer, but an amazing speaker. They talk for hours and write the screenplays together. But Kieslowski admits that usually all the great ideas come from Piesiewicz. These three masterful men were able to create a perfect film cycle. Krzysztof Kieslowski was very talented in visual narrative he didn't need dialog to explain certain things and emotions. For example the old lady recycling the bottle, Julie sees her but decides not to help her. In Red the main character sees her and does decide to help her. In Blue we are clearly told that Freedom is only an illusion, which people so hardly try to reach but never can get. If White portrays love as a prison then in Blue the paradox of love and freedom comes from the impossibility to set oneself free and become independent when still in love. Because to Kieslowski love is the strongest force of all just as it says in The Love Chapter. Only love can expose the true nature of freedom.",

Her wound is so deep that she initially rejects everything around her, but in her numbness and isolation the past creeps in, often in the form of an unfinished musical composition. This haunting by music and evolving over time to pick it up again and finish it fits in well with the process she's going through. The pace of the film is a little on the deliberate side, and unfortunately I didn't feel a cathartic connection while watching it, which made me like it more for the craft than emotionally. On the other hand, I did feel as though I should be more gentle and kind to people I run across in real life who may be acting out in their own unseen private worlds of grief. I also loved how director Krzysztof Kieslowski gave us some very nice effects with lights and reflections, including that marvelous shot of the little girl looking through the back window of the car early on. The various effects in blue over the course of the film do eventually start feeling a little forced though. Not bad, but not one I'd be rushing to watch again.",

(It's one of the Three Colors trilogy by director Kieslowski. The other two are Three Colors: White with Julie Delpy, and Three Colors: Red with Ir\u00e8ne Jacob.)The film opens with a tragic accident. Julie Vignon (Juliette Binoche) is riding in a car with her husband and young daughter when the brakes fail and the car smashes into a tree. Her husband and daughter are killed. Julie is seriously injured, but survives.This isn't only a personal tragedy; it's a national tragedy as well. Julie's husband is a famous composer, and he was in the midst of creating a major piece of music that would celebrate the possibility of a united Europe.The rest of the movie shows us how Julie copes with her new life situation, and her possible love in the person of her husband's colleague Olivier, played by Beno\u00eet R\u00e9gent. Binoche is at the center of the film. She is the sun around which all the other characters revolve. I don't know if the movie would have worked with a different actor in the role.Binoche is outstanding. We know she's outstanding. She knows she's outstanding. Most important, director Kieslowski knows she's outstanding. She's in almost every scene, and, in almost every scene, she's front and center. That's because Kieslowski can't take his eyes --or his camera--away from her.Binoche is beautiful, but in a unique way. Some of her contemporary French female actors--Anne Parillaud, Emmanuelle B\u00e9art--are classically beautiful. However, Binoche is beautiful in her own strong, intelligent way. OK--as my wife pointed out, her cheekbones have cheekbones. Still, she's not standard \"movie star\" beautiful. She's a great actor who happens to be very attractive. It's a wonderful combination.We saw this film at the excellent Dryden Theatre at George Eastman Museum in Rochester, NY. It was shown as part of the \"Three Colors: Remembering Krzysztof Kieslowski\" series. It was great to see the movie on the large screen, but it will work almost as well on the small screen. This is a \"must see\" film for people who love French cinema. Even if you don't love French cinema, seek it out and watch it. You won't be disappointed.",

One of her husband's associates (who has loved her and sleeps with her one evening) wants to finish the master's final composition.

            "content": "Krzysztof Kieslowski was one of the more interesting filmmakers of the last quarter century, and the centerpiece of his claim to greatness is the Three Colors (Trois Couleurs) trilogy of films that he wrote and directed in the early to mid-1990s, filming them all at the same time. Blue, White, and Red represent the three colors of the French flag, and symbolize the three virtues of liberty, equality, and fraternity respectively. Blue (Bleu) is the first film in the series, and was released in 1993. The color blue also resonates for its associations with depression and coldness, that are well demonstrated in the film. It was deserving of the many award sit garnered, such as winning Best Film at the Venice Film Festival and the Goya Awards, as well as star Juliette Binoche (who looks like a prettier Julia Roberts, as well as a better actress) winning Best Actress at Venice and the Cesar Awards.Yet, Kieslowski made a wise choice to depoliticize his films, for the freedom that Blue deals with is not political but personal and emotional- a hoped for freedom from memories, and not the cheap sort that Hollywood would foist, such as a woman running away from an abusive boyfriend. If only more artists (think Latin American writers) could learn that political statements can be made slyly and subtly and wield far more power than overt preaching. Another wise move he made was to cast this film as a picaresque, whose main character is delineated in small strokes, with scenes that do not drive simple plot not character development, but stand alone and apart as merely defining her state of mind.The film starts with an automobile accident that kills off a husband and father, the famous musical composer Patrice de Courcy, and his five year old daughter Anna. The only survivor is his wife, named Julie de Courcy ne\u00e9 Vignon (Juliette Binoche). This is foreshadowed when we see a shot of leaking brake fluid from the car when the daughter is let off the side of the road to urinate. Fortunately, the crash occurs off camera, not in the melodramatic style a Hollywood film would drool over. Interestingly, at the end of the film, after the credits, Kieslowski has a sly tweak when he notes that, since the car is an Alfa Romeo, any loss of brake fluid, and the accident, are purely fictional events. When Julie wakes in a hospital we see an extreme close up of her pupil reflecting the image of her doctor. It is an objective shot of subjectivity after Julie regains her consciousness after an unspecified period of time. This ellipsis of death to the opened eye has a great psychic resonance to the viewer, in a way mere words cannot. She recovers, after a fey attempt at suicide by overdose at her hospital, and decides to abandon her country estate and set out for an anonymous life in Paris. In one scene, Julie comes upon her old maid who is crying. She asks, 'Why are you crying?' The maid answers, 'I am crying because you are not.' The rest of the plot has been detailed by others. I started this review by stating that Krzysztof Kieslowski was one of the more interesting filmmakers of the last quarter century, and I stand by that claim. The only thing a viewing of this film will add to that claim is to append the term great to that description, for Blue is a flat-out masterpiece. It is as mysterious as a work of Antonioni, symbolic as a film of Bergman, humane as a work of Fellini, and precise as a work of Kubrick. That's good company to keep, and this film earns such companionship",

She tries to avoid making connections but inevitable she gets involved with new people and reconnects with people from her past who search for her.Director Krzysztof Kieslowski does a fine job bringing this story about how one woman deals with loss to the screen. It isn't about visible grief but the numbness that leads Julie to try to isolate herself and move away from her old life. The blue motif is used to fine effect throughout the film; whether it is the pool Julie swims in or the blue ornament in her flat, one of the few things she kept from her old life. Juliette Binoche, who is rarely off screen, does a brilliant job in the lead role; making the viewer believe in Julie's situation. The story plays out well with as it depicts Julie's gradual coming to terms with what happens. Overall I'd say this won't be for everybody but if you enjoy 'art house cinema' then this is definitely one to watch.",

To me, besides the gorgeous cinematography and use of the color blue which is very distinctively applied visually throughout, it's all about Juliette Binoche's superb work as a woman trying to suppress feelings of loss and sadness, by cutting herself off from everything that reminds her of the life before the accident. But, every step she takes towards this goal seems futile as the past returns time and again. At first, she does seem liberated, moving to a new building, with the financial resources available to do nothing except live, such as visiting a caf\u00e9 to drink her coffee and eat her ice cream, listen to a seemingly homeless talented flute player, swim in a nearby pool, and spend her days with a symphony of sound presenting itself in her mind. It is established that Julie actually helped write the orchestras her husband was held in high esteem for. She later learns that her husband had a lover and this lawyer is carrying his child. Julie was also herself having an affair with an associate of her husband's, himself a musician. This man is truly in love with Julie and so desperately wants to compose a work for the Unification of Europe, but needs her help in order to bring it to life. I think the movie is about accepting a tragedy in order to heal. I don't think one ever can completely free herself/himself from the grief of losing those you love and certainly understand the complex feelings of anger and pain about this unpleasant event that forever changes your life. Binoche is an actress I hold in high regard because I have an affinity for those who can communicate to us without the crutch of dialogue. Sure dialogue can help, but when you can tell us how you feel with very little in the way of words, I, for one(and I imagine I'm not alone), think this says much more of the ability of an actress. Binoche has always been that kind of actress, and that is why I watch a movie if her name is in the credits. I was moved by this movie because the content and central performance connected with me in that I could sympathize with how difficult such circumstances could be when you lose a family and are left alone. You don't want to face those feelings..they are there and I'm glad that eventually Julie does finish the symphony with Olivier(Beno\u00eet R\u00e9gent) and decides to restart a relationship with him. The film also shows how Julie befriends a stripper whose not as base and evil a \"loose woman\" as her detractors might paint her as. We also see how Julie's mother's memory is fading and the boy who was present where the crash took place finds her so he can return a necklace and pass on something her husband said before passing away. These people, her mother, the boy, her former lover, the stripper, alter her plans at a new and different life. It is, however, for her own benefit. I do think we want her to be emotionally healthier and embracing life again truly is the way, don't you believe? Two great instances of communicating her inner turmoil are the lollipop and \"hand scraping alongside a wall\" scenes. Not to mention, the scenes in the pool when she often contemplates suicide, holding herself underwater, before coming to her senses and re-emerging.",

People have been recommending the movie to me literally for several years, and I never got around to watching it until last night, after I recently purchased the trilogy for a whopping 30 yuan (about $4.25), thanks to China's total indifference to copyright laws. The movie is suitably depressing and highly artistic, and although some of the technical experiments didn't really work for me, the story itself is outstanding. Early in the movie there is a clumsy use of a flashing blue screen that might remind some Hitchcock fans of the psychological use of color in Vertigo, but it's one of the examples of the overuse of blue in the movie that came to me to be a little redundant. The movie is called Blue and it's an emotional color, I don't think we really need to be hit over the head with it so many times. Juliette Binoche stars as Julie Vignon, the wife of a famous composer who dies in a car crash, along with their daughter, throwing her entire life into total emotional chaos. She responds by trying to erase her memories of her lost past. She sells all of her possessions, moves to a new place, and goes back to her maiden name. Throughout this time, she immerses herself in her sadness, just like that astonishingly blue swimming pool.Obviously, music is an extremely important part of the film, it takes us on an entirely separate journey through Julie's sadness and emotional development. The movie illustrates her loss of feeling, her inability to form meaningful connections with other people after her catastrophic loss, and through the thoroughly unexpected turns of events that take place throughout the movie to allow her life to continue, in completely unexpected directions. There is a lot of focus on minute details in the film, long shots that focus on seemingly trivial objects but that create a surreal environment that is almost impossible to create in any other way, similar to the effect that Binoche gets with her particular style of under-acting. There are a few moments in the film when the screen fades to black for a few seconds and then fades back in to exactly the same shot. I imagine Kieslowski was going for some kind of temporary mental blackout, triggered by an emotion or a sudden painful memory, but it just came across as campy to me. Nevertheless, the movie has such a powerful and involving story that it's easy to overlook things like this, although this is certainly not the feel good movie of the year. By far the film's best feature is the story, which is brilliantly written and takes us on a fascinating journey, followed by the stupendous performances. Kieslowski is not one of our most accessible directors, but certainly one of the most enduring.",

Julie, who was very much in love with her husband, essentially withdraws from her life as an attempt to cope with her tremendous loss. This is also coloured by the fact that her husband was a composer and died before completing a very important work. This music haunts her at the same time. She does communicate with people from her past, and new people, and learns lessons on the journey that takes her to end of the movie.This movie is a relatively small tale, as expected, but magnifies the enormity of loss from a micro to macro level and gives it a tangible feel. Juliette Binoche is excellent as Julie, and the rest of the cast put in great performances. Direction is also particularly good, especially the cinematography.

But I found Bleu flat, and worse, intensely boring. It is, to me, a meandering, pointless exercise in the meaning of fidelity / freedom. Characters behave quirkily without any seeming motivation, and arrive and leave seemingly at random never to be seen again just so that we can have another incidence of infidelity dumped into the picture. There is just too little backstory to make you care about Binoche's character, and too little plot to propel you into the film. I guess what I'm trying to say is that while \"idea based\" films can be enthralling, they can only be enthralling when there is a plot which successfully carries the idea (which is exactly what makes Rouge a masterpiece). Here, there's no plot, just the - pretty primitive - idea, which is exactly why I think Bleu is not a masterpiece.",

            "content": "\"Blue,\" the 1993 opening film in Krzysztof Kieslowski's \"Blue, White & Red\" trilogy, sports perhaps the most fitting title of the three. It tells the story of Julie, a 33-year-old woman who has just lost her composer husband and young daughter in a terrible automobile accident. Thrown into the bluest of blue funks (and who wouldn't be?), Julie moves to a flat in Paris and tries to divorce herself from life, telling herself that money, love and friendships are all traps. But what at first seems to be an extremely downbeat film proves rather life affirming, as Julie discovers that maybe there are things left to her worth engaging with after all. Her newfound and unwanted liberty (blue is the color of the French flag that corresponds with \"liberty,\" oui?), her sudden independence, may not be as desirable as she initially thought.... \"Blue\" is a film loaded with all sorts of symbolism and suggested meanings. It features world-class direction, striking photography (although that impressive image-on-the-cornea shot was used to better effect in \"Goldfinger\" some 30 years before) and impeccable acting, especially from Juliette Binoche in the lead. It is certainly not the picture for viewers desiring speed, but nonetheless rewards the patient viewer with its ultimately uplifting message that life does have a way of pulling us back in. Though easily the most somber of the trilogy, it is not at all depressing, and didn't leave me feeling blue at all. Oh...has anyone else noticed that although Julie's daughter is reported to be 5 at her funeral, the dates on her coffin indicate 7? Is this an error on the director's part (hard to believe, with such an impeccable craftsman as Kieslowski) or something else that needs to be thought about by the viewer? In a picture that offers so much food for thought, this is just one more tasty morsel.",

            "content": "\"Most of this film is about feeling directionless and hopeless after a tragedy, and not knowing what to do with oneself, not knowing how to cope. I've read that people have interpreted this film as an anti-tragedy, and I could absolutely see that, because when her family dies, Julie's character shuts down, but not in a typical way. Julie's character seems driven to forget about what has happened, so much so that she doesn't even seem to really process the tragedy that's happened to her. Even though we have never met the person she was before the accident, we can tell that she has become a different person than she used to be from the interactions she has with characters that knew her before. Kieslowski's direction is amazing because he's able to capture the feeling of isolation through his framing, and the colors he chooses to use. Oftentimes, Julie's character is partially obscured, or the upper half of the frame will be shrouded in darkness, as if she is hiding away her emotions, or if a dark cloud of depression hangs above her.\nBinoche herself is spellbinding as Julie. It's hard to play emotionless without being boring. Julie goes into her emotionless state and doesn't outwardly change much at all, but through some of her interactions with others, we get glimpses into her psyche. She doesn't cry or sob when her child and husband die, but she will call an old friend up for sex and then discard him immediately. However, after that, she felt horrible about doing it, as shown by the scene where Julie drags her knuckles across a brick wall. Throughout this time, Julie puts up a stoic front, even when she's alone, but slowly, as time goes by and more things come out about her husband, Julie starts to let down her defenses. It really speaks to Binoche as an actor that she is able to show this subtle growth in character, for the way she processes grief is so muffled that it takes someone of her quality to make those subtleties shine through.",

(R)After her husband and child die in a car crash, Binoche attempts to retreat from everything she once had (house sold, husband's work destroyed, ties with her mother severed, etc.), but finds it difficult, if not impossible, to abandon her past outright. Unevenly-paced but fascinating drama is artfully lit, photographed and edited--as expected from the title, color plays an important role, with the blue motif used to memorable effect as a calming but melancholy presence. While delivering a brilliantly understated but passionate performance, Binoche dominates as a somewhat enigmatic and unsympathetic character, but those dealing with grief are often difficult and unpredictable; her prickly nature staves off the confrontational and prevents the film from becoming fully absorbing, and the striking final sequence may be a visual marvel, but not an emotional one. First part of the \"Three Colours\" trilogy, each one themed from the colors of the French flag (and revolutionary motto); blue represents \"liberty,\" though it is, of course, not the sort of freedom that most would ever wish for.72/100",

The entire time I watched this, the thought kept rolling through my head: \"This woman needs to see someone\".  But that notwithstanding, Blue took me in early and then lost me toward the end.  The movie plays a series of events in the life of a woman who wants to completely start over after losing her husband and daughter.  Several oddballs come and go into her life, all the while kept at a cold distance by Binoche's Julie.  In the beginning, I felt sympathy for Julie (who wouldn't?), but as the film wore on, the lead character's distant emotions began to wear me down, and I lost interest.  The little surprises we learn toward the end didn't do too much for me, as Julie seems no better or worse than she did in the beginning. I'll mark this \"overrated\".",

This is yet another technique often used by Kieslowski to heighten the intellectual capacity of his films.'' This is a quote I read concerning this film and which to me sums up the pseudo-intellectual gobbledygook that seems to surround this director when he brings a new film to town. Yes, 'Blue' is a study in overcoming grief: it is also an exercise in over-indulgence. One of the 'unrelated shots' referred to would undoubtedly have been the scene where the camera pans away from a troubled Julie (Binoche) onto the street where an old lady, bent double with osteoporosis, is endeavouring to deposit a bottle into a bottle bank. The camera lingers while she labours to push the bottle through the slot. Mission accomplished the scene changes to something totally unrelated. What was the purpose of that scene? What did the pain of an crippled old lady have to do with Julie's tribulations? Is it Kieslowski's purpose in life to make you believe that every unrelated scene has some hidden symbolism or is he really having a laugh at how foolish we are. Having previous seen his 'Veronique' which was similarly puzzling I have reached the conclusion that this director now has a status, like that of many modern artists, where nobody dare criticise for fear of being called an intellectual philistine. On the credit side however is the use of classical music which engendered atmosphere something which it also achieved in 'Veronique'. Of Juliet Binoche what can be said that hasn't been said already? A superb actress with a wonderfully expressive face. In my opinion the only reason to watch this film.",

It's really stunning the way she gathers herself together at the end, but the final shot shows us that she'll never truly be rid of the pain from that situation. We also see how one person in such a tragic circumstance can affect so many lives and I thought that was really touching. Kieslowski does amazing work with colors here as he uses stark, vibrant reds, greens and blues that completely draw the viewers attention and suck them in. I loved the little scenario with the mice in Julie's apartment and how instinctively she tried to kill them but once she realized it was a family she was unable to do it. I also adored the repetition of her diving into the lush blue swimming pool, as a way of almost freeing herself from all of the stress and pain that's building up inside of her. Of course the first thing she does when she emerges from the water is cry. Overall it's a completely sublime film that I couldn't take my eyes off of. The final shot of Binoche (who gives an amazingly subtle performance) staring directly into the camera with a tear dried on her face and another emerges and runs down is truly heartbreaking. It feels as though she's staring right through us and into our soul.",

She struggles to cope with this enormous emotional gut punch by distancing herself from her past, from her old life, from her memories. She tries to free herself from her anguish and sorrow.The story is not a bad one and the film is certainly well-acted, but I have to admit that this whole trilogy shines for me because of its technical aspects. The camerawork is superb, the acting is really nice and the locations are evocative. But mainly it's the use of colour. Shocking, I know. This film is so blue, and in a really inventive way that supports the story. Blue is a melancholic colour, it's a deep colour. But it's also a refreshing colour, a cool, calming colour. And that's all reflected in the film.I'd call Blue a good gateway film into more artistic films. It has a plot, it has characters, it has an arc, but a lot of the subtext is only implied and has to reasoned out from the colours, from the score, from the imagery.

Julie de Courcy (exquisitely portrayed by Juliette Binoche) loses her husband and 6 year-old daughter to a horrific car-crash (in which Julie was also a passenger, but somehow survived). Julie awakes in a hospital bed in throws of bleakest, deepest-depression (learning that both her daughter and husband have perished)....... and attempts suicide, to no avail.Once returning home to a large-estate, Julie begins the process of selling-off (sometimes even destroying) everything that 'attaches' herself to her old Life as a wife and mother..... and intends to begin 'anew' with no lingering possessions or reminders of past emotional-connections.One complicating factor is that Julie's deceased husband Patrice de Courcy happened to be a very prominent Classical Music composer in France and was in the process of creating an important large-scale musical-piece to celebrate the burgeoning 'European-Union' (ironically Krzysztof Kieslowski's \"Bleu\" was filmed circa1992 just as the 'Cold-War' had ended and a new optimistic sense of both freedom & Unity was in the air in Europe --- looking back circa 2019, this early 1990's idealistic-vision of a unified-democratic Europe feels tragically-ironic indeed in the shadow of tenuous present-Day). It is also revealed that Julie was herself a 'gifted' Music composer and actually has the equal talent-ability to complete her husband's 'Last' great Score (but apparently chooses to destroy it instead?!)There is much, much more to this story filled with rumination & complexity about paths taken (and not taken) with bravura multi-dimensional performance by Juliette Binoche in an exceedingly demanding role requiring 'quiet' projection of internal turmoil.......... but the main question that writer-director Krzysztof Kieslowski seems to raise is whether any of us can be truly freed/ liberated from those deeply-engraved human-connections, not just the palpably-immediate ones but those that have indelibly-affixed and covertly-impacted over time (significantly influencing a Lifetime)........ in addition, Juliet is faced with unexpected trauma-revelation (about her husband's past) and is confronted with numerous 'choices' that will crucially impact her own way forward (choices that will also deeply-affect the Lives of those who remain eternally 'connected' to Juliet).",

It follows a story of a woman;Julie, played by Juliet Binoche dealing with the pain and her life after the accidental death of her husband and her daughter. She is completely cut off from everyone else around her life, and she decides to deal with the pain on her own terms. After her loss, she destroys all music notes composed by her husband and sells anything in her house that would bring her memories from the past. She is sad and shaken. She tests her self whether she could feel any love by seducing the man who was working with her husband who was secretly in love with her. No she cannot. She settles into an apartment by herself to be free, to begin life all over again or to just avoid the urge to begin. Krzysztof Kieslowski, who was one of the most prolific filmmakers, was a devotee of such filmmakers as Bergman and Tarkovsky, who explored subjects of faith, philosophy and death. Kieslowski here too dives into these subjects in a fashionable way, playing around with some of the scenes to show the inner nature of the characters using beautiful cinematography and story telling techniques. The use of close ups in the movie has a profound effect in portraying the mindset of a character. We read their faces to understand what it says even though the words are not present to express it. Towards the end there is quite a surprise when she meets the mistress of her dead husband who is now pregnant with his child. How they deal with this discovery and most importantly how Julie deals with it presents a great revelation about her.",

            "content": "Freedom is a beautiful word but \"Blue\" deals with the kind of freedom we'd rather not confront once, the one born from the rejection of all achievements, possessions and items of meaningfulness that defined our life... after a tragedy struck.Julie loses her husband and daughter in a car accident. She tries to commit suicide but living is too strong a call to be ignored, she spits out the tablets and apologizes to the nurse for breaking a glass. Later, she sells her property, gets rid of her fortune and starts a new life with what's at hands: anything but the past that would drown her in an ocean of melancholy. The only concession to the past is that Julie knows she'll never be happy.And so she moves to some random apartment in Paris and has an affair with the man she knew was in love with her. This is the freedom she doesn't enjoy as much as she undergoes it in a sort of survival and cathartic move. Whether it's truly freedom is left to debate, but we're never left with the feeling that Julie is seeking joy, maybe contentment, acceptance and pinches of satisfaction here and there. So life goes on and appease wounds but allows a few corridors to the past, weakening that fragile 'rebirth' edifice.And I guess the appeal of \"Blue\" relies on that very fragility, one that only Juliette Binoche, one of the sweetest and most delicate faces of French cinema could portray. Binoche is so great an actress that even her expressionless moments deliver the right amount of emotionality. She never looks totally happy, nor totally sad, but always at the verge of two totally opposite emotional directions, whatever they are. She's walking on a tightrope with the past acting like gravity and the wind of present blowing, she can only move forward, never look down, any step back and it's the big plunge.This is not a character but a feeling's study, a remarkable exploration of the complexity of a brave soul from Krzysztof Kieslowski. The late Polish director uses many shots that emphasize Julie's perspective: a close up on a sugar cube absorbing the coffee, a fight seen from her balcony, a street flutist, an old lady with a stooped posture, a family of mice found in the new house. Like the sugar cube, Julie absorbs all these encounters as micro-experiences and then drops everything, never letting any encounter rooting in her life, she finds comfort in the vacuum of the present.It's easy to regard \"Blue\", the first opus of the famous \"Three Colors\" trilogy as an auteur film without a tangible plot but with an introspective look on life. The film might strike as too slow, too contemplative, too bizarre in its editing but it could only work as long as Binoche was consistent with her character... and she always was, as a woman who, unlike Blanche Dubois, depends on the comprehension of strangers. Life has been so unkind to her she can deal without kindness and this is why she has no scruples throwing her husband's last opera partition (composed for some European Union ceremony) in a waste truck. But maybe Art is too great a thing not to survive and Kieslowski the storyteller can't side anymore with his muse and allow the music to resurface in the story.In the end, it's up to Julie to accept that she can't pretend her past doesn't exist because her husband affected so many lives and those lives still depend on him. There's an arc in Julie's journey in the way she cancels out a few clauses of her existential pact after realizing the way her selfishness deprived people from something that meant a lot in their own lives. The director is too passionate an artist to have a great piece of music being sacrificed, even in a fiction, and there might be a symbolic parallel between the posthumous oeuvre and one baby leaving in the womb of a mistress. Life like the show must go on... and perhaps the greatest triumph of Julie would be to face the present without pretending the past doesn't exist.I think it's a film about grief more than any exhilaration of freedom. The photography is always intimate even in the external shots, served by a beautiful cinematography, exploring any possibility to paint the screen in a shade of blue (a swimming pool, emerald stones, a blue room). But beyond all these photographic tricks and this is coming from someone whose favorite color happens to be blue, the story was so absorbing that I could find a whole world in Binoche's blue performance. Whether it was intentional that the \"Blue\" opus would be that sad I don't know but it's a film that I won't forget any soon... not on a personal level. As a father, I can't imagine how unbearable life would be if something ever happened to my daughter. I don't know if I'd be as tough as Julie, but I guess I would try to find a way.It's a cathartic experience indeed, difficult and serious but short enough to sustain that heaviness in gravity. I won't forget that shot where Julie is in fetal position in the swimming pool, she doesn't sink, doesn't float, doesn't swim, she resists like a baby in the mother's womb... waiting for the miraculous rebirth, as a woman without a past. At the end she's a woman with a past and a future, reconciled with time and able to let a timid smile slip from her face. Just because tears are flowing all over your eyes doesn't mean life isn't worth a little smile, after all.There's probably a lot to say about \"Blue\" but let's just see what's behind \"White\" now, the story about equality... though I suspect it will rise above these values' gimmick and be another powerful statement about something about life. We'll see...",

            "content": "This is one of the best movies I have ever seen.Not only for Juliette Binoche's excellent performance, but also for the delicate cinematography, the haunting music and the overall texture of immersion in the world of the young woman. If you are after car chases, exploding jets and gun-toting macho muscle-men, then stop reading now, this is not for you.I enjoyed the other two films in the trilogy (\"Three colours Red\" and \"Three Colours White\"), but \"...Blue\" is easily the best. Kieslowski's movies are very different from the formulaic action movies that steer you firmly down a plotline, without giving the audience time to absorb any feeling. Without giving anything away, the story centres on the life of a young woman who experiences a great loss, and how everything changes, how she reacts, what happens next and much more. Music plays a central part in the plot and the scene where her finger traces the score as she shapes the symphony for Europe, is unforgettable. As you watch it you are lulled by the music yet also aware of the tension between her lover and her. Simply put, this film is subtle and moving, beautiful to watch, has a haunting musical soundtrack (I bought the CD as well, I have to say) and is never sentimental or cliched, not for a minute. There are little link scenes that join this movie with the other \"Three colours...\" movies - the storylines are separate but overlap.If you liked this, see also \"Three colours Red\" and \"The Unbearable lightness of Being\". It's best on the big screen.I now have the DVD versions of Three Colours Red, Blue and White , and it is interesting to see the director's commentary and actress interviews. Sadly the director (Krystof Kieslowski) died after making these films. At his funeral they played the same music that was composed for the funeral scene in \"Blue\". \"Blue\" remains my favourite.In his interview clip he comes across as obsessed with his movies - sweaty, taut, focussed on his work. The DVD content was obviusly dug up after the movie was made, but it is all the better for that.",

            "content": "\"Trois Couleurs: Bleu\" often ranks only second in Krzysztof Kieslowski's trilogy dealing with liberty, equality and friendship. True, the picture doesn't have the emotions on the forefront like Rouge does, but in its coldness, estrangement and portrayal of unspeakable desperation, its painful observation of someone who just cannot go on anymore lies its strength. Juliette Binoche plays a woman who epitomizes loss: her husband is dead, so is her daughter, all in an instant. Gone is what she was used to call her life, her passion for everything she ever cared for, the money has lost its importance, even her demented mother doesn't know anymore who she is, and it doesn't end there. Staggering on the brink of the abyss there is no will anymore to leap over the cliff, but even with the decision to retreat from everything the lives of others are affected...\"Bleu\" is the perfect combination of a visually oriented director, great script and editing (e.g. with inventive fade to blacks) - and an actress who perfectly understands how to play a grieving, inaccessible widow and at the same time the fragile being who could shatter any minute. Oh, and we shouldn't forget the importance of music in this movie, as this is what it's all about: To bring back music in someone's life in order to liberate the self from, well, let's say: being blue. It works so well that it hurts - but that's the purpose.",

            "review_title": "Addition and subtraction.",
            "content": "Taken as a whole, the \"Thee Colors\" trilogy is certainly a work that is greater than the sum of it's part. It represents the totality of life by way of trichotomy, and by a process of addition, each film adding on another aspect, another color, to what came before. Blue is tragedy, white is comedy, and red is... well, it is indeed hard to pin down, but I would think that it is perhaps romance. At the same time, like the way bits of each film make guest appearances in the others, each of these aspects, each color, is mixed with parts of the others. Therefore, it's important to see all the films, and they really should ideally be seen in their chronological order, for only at the end of it all - when it all adds up - do we find the sense of completion that gives the work its true magic. Therefore, I won't be commenting on Blue and pretend the others don't exist. They must be taken together as a three-course meal.In light of this it may seem almost paradoxical that each of the individual films in certain respects are based on an opposite process, an act of subtraction. The beauty and poetry of these works is just as often as not a result of what is not said, what is left out and must be inferred, what is never confirmed, what is left hanging. This act of subtraction is given most poignantly in \"Blue\".The accident that opens the movie and grants Julie that tragic liberty that she never asked for and never wanted, sets in play a process of removal that we feel cannot be stopped, until it either reaches its conclusion or some greater outer force intervenes. Julie never, for a second, attempts to restore the fragments of her lost life. Once the process of destruction is started, she does not attempt to stop it. The bulk of the movie shows her systematically destroying what is left, and all memories of what was. She gets rid of the mansion where she lived with her family, including all furniture and belongings. She angrily, in an act of stunning subdued violence, chews and devours a lollipop that had been her daughter's. Finally, she tries to destroy the score for her husband's symphony for the Unification of Europe.In a movie about a woman who has lost her husband and her child, we may expect certain kinds of scenes: flashbacks, memory sequences, returns to what has been lost. These are all notably missing from \"Blue\". Julie doesn't return, not to her past or to the world of the living, not until outside forces \u0096 Kieslowski's wonderful random acts of genius storytelling - intrude.At the end of the day, \"Blue\", mercifully, ends on a note of affirmation of life, optimistically, even happily. It is, of course, a \"happy ending\" unlike any other in cinema, one that can only be brought about by way of the most extreme grief and loss. It's a phenomenological process of sorts, in the Husserlian sense. For Husserl, only by removing the objects of consciousness, by constantly subtracting what is in it, can we hope to arrive at understanding of consciousness itself. For Julie, only be removing everything that her life contained, by going down to the bare bones of her self, can she truly find herself, and start living again. In the end, life wins out and starts anew. Even after the greatest apocalypse, some seeds of life have escaped death, and they will continue to grow and to flower.This is one of my favorite movies of all time, an opinion that is, I believe, shared by everyone who sees it. It's more than a trip to the movies. It's even more than an experience of immense beauty, even if it is, of course, that too. It is, in my opinion, an opportunity to take part in a process of discovery of what it is to be human, that will leave you a better person afterwards.",

            "content": "This is one of the masterpieces of Kieslowski. A film that speaks about loneliness, grieving and death, which leaves you with a feeling of premonition, knowing that the director died a few years later leaving so many films undone.This is the story of Julie acted by Juliette Binoche who loses her husband, a famous composer and young daughter in a car accident. After an unsuccessful tentative of suicide she leaves the house where she was living with her family and moves to Paris. In fact she is not sure what to do with her life, she does not know how to cope with the loss, she does not even know if she is capable of feeling anything any longer. While life goes on around her she seems to become kind of a spectator, tries to forget and disconnect from memories in order to alleviate the grieving. Even discovering that her husband had an affair with another woman who is expecting a child from him does not really shake her, although this seems to trigger a process of returning to reality. Will she close the circle? The end seems to say yes - on a factual plan at least - as she is finishing a composition that her husband worked at, and she is restarting a liaison with a friend and long time admirer, but we are not that sure that this also happens on an emotional plan. The last sequence seems to show the principal characters that crossed her path in the movie being each alone in his universe. Real life cannot be lived more than once, loneliness surrounds us in our awaiting for death.Binoche acts beautifully, it's maybe her best role. The pace is slow, the tone is melancholic, but if you like human stories, that make you think and feel this is a movie that you would not miss.",

The film is about a woman named Julie who survives a car accident while her husband and daughter were killed. Julie tries to start life again on her own in an apartment in Paris. Along the way Julie discovers things she did not know about her husband and she has to come to terms with her life now that her husband and daughter are gone. Winner of The CEC Award for Best Foreign Film at The Cinema Writers Circle Awards; The Cesar Award for Best Actress (Juliette Binoche who plays Julie), Best Editing and Best Sound at The Cesar Awards; The Goya Award for Best European Film at The Goya Awards; The Guild Film Award Gold for Foreign Film at The Guild of German Art House Cinemas; The Silver Ribbon for Best Female Dubbing at The Italian National Syndicate of Film Journalists; The LAFCA Award for Best Music at The Los Angeles Film Critics Association Awards; The Sant Jordi Award for Best Foreign Actress and Best Foreign Film at The Sant Jordi Awards and The Golden Lion (for director and co-writer Krzysztof Kieslowski), The Golden Osella for Best Cinematography and The Volpi Cup for Best Actress at The Venice Film Festival. The film has good direction, a good script, a good performance by Juliette Binoche, good original music, good film editing and good cinematography. The film's director and co-writer Krzysztof Kieslowski made this film in a trilogy of films he called the Three Colors trilogy which is followed by the films White and Red. Blue is a quiet and small film in many ways. There is not a lot of dialogue in the film and the general story is relatively simple when you first view the film, but after viewing it you will later think about it for awhile and have some questions about it. The movie is good looking and I think Juliette Binoche did a very good job expressing her emotions just by her facial expressions and mannerisms instead of using talking seeing as there isn't a lot of that in the film. The film also has a beautiful yet haunting look to it which is very artistic and stylish. Although the film is a little slow moving I was never bored with it and as it moved on I grew more and more curious about the Julie character and I really wanted to see what would happen with her at the end. There is also some neat twists and unpredictable scenes in here that I thought worked quite well too. I must also commend the film for it's great character study of Julie, a woman who is grieving and is also in a state of self discovery. The film is a small and quiet film but it is fascinating and neat to look at and also is quite a thought provoking and intelligent film.",

So much for the rebeliousness!Second - I have an issue with Julie being sad because her husband died - that is no mention of her (presumably) child, while hers being a clearly dysfunctional family clearly on the road to divorce. In the end - it's just not believable and there is nobody (except \"the whore\", and as an aside - thanks social development that we, at least in most of the developed world, moved away from prying into people's private lives to the point of actually causing them harm in their public lives), who has any, ANY appeal in this story.If you like the pretence of style over Substance of Camus' \"Stranger\" you will like that movie, or if you like an unintentional comedic jumpscare horror with 2 creepface men and 1 resting assface woman as a protagonist - this movie is for you, for the rest - avoid and watch modern American drama.Sadly in this movie I feel I can see the beginning of the fall of the European cinema from making movies close to life, to being just another socialist Soviet Union cinema which exists solely because it's funded by the government and the \"cultivated\" class through lobbying.",

Permeated with a deep sense of loss, grief & melancholia and driven by a soulful performance from its leading lady, it is a thoughtful, meditative & emotionally engrossing effort.Co-written & directed by Krzysztof Kieslowski, the story opens with the tragedy that sets its plot into motion and patiently covers the journey of our protagonist from her self-imposed isolation to eventual healing. Kieslowski's direction exhibits both calm & composure, and the incorporation of blue hues, props & lighting into the narrative are tastefully carried out.Juliette Binoche is extremely convincing in her role, articulating her character's loss, trauma, pain, sorrow & inner conflict with emotional precision while also highlighting her road to recovery with a subtle touch. Her arc trajectory is interesting throughout and Binoche almost single-handedly steers the film past the finish line. The score is another key aspect that stands out with ease.Overall, Three Colours: Blue is as hopeful as it is heartbreaking, and features an exquisitely scripted & elegantly directed story that's brought to life with grace & compassion. Making deft use of close-ups, fade-outs & quiet movements, the camera stays in vicinity of its character at all times while steady pace & smart editing provide ample space for the events to play out.

This is an easier dive, but that doesn't mean the dive isn't excellently performed. I would take a whole point of the IMDB score under any such system!)While I admire cinematography and symbolism in movies I believe these are the support structures to the story. Here they push the story to one side and take over - to the point where there is often nothing but mood, posture and music.A move dedicated to grief and re-building is hardly going to be a laugh a minute, but Binoche wants to be frosty and controlled through the vast majority of this short (for a main feature) movie. Sorry, people don't grieve like that in real life - it is more a rollercoaster of emotions.We know so little about this now-ended relationship. How was she before the accident? How did they really interact? Was it really a happy relationship? We know that her husband was no angel - but how do we know this wasn't known to JB? A checklist of questions is not what I want in a movie that exclusively takes on one woman's life experience in such close up.Thankfully the final message is positive - life can be rebuilt.

First, the plot or the process of going through pain and grieving but also the human resilience of surviving the lost of cherished ones, an infant daughter evidently more so in the movie than a husband. Second, the cast: Binoche, Binoche and Binoche. She's centerpiece and rightly so. She's a mountain of emotion and strength that permeates the screen. Third, the music that Preisner wrote prompted me to buy the soundtrack. For anyone who has it, they can share with great emotion when one hears Juliette say: Vous me montrez ce que vous avez compos\u00e9? (You want to show me what you have composed?). Her voice seems only a murmur, but at the same time commanding as of one who knows what to expect; and the movie as it unfolds tells us that it is not much. Olivier wanted to finish her husband's work which she reluctantly agrees to but the resulting effort is really unimpressive. She corrects the work by taking away instruments. Why Olivier put them in in the first place was gauche. She repelled him throughout the film because he was too insisting as if he wanted something from her; the same thing her dead husband got ? The storyline is very subtle.This is not meant to be a spoiler but a persisting feeling throughout the film is that Julie is really the composer of the symphony. This is what the journalist implies in her reportage. But she would rather not be known as such and she hided behind her ex-husband. Now, Olivier that knew this, wants to take his place and she turns him away until she gives in. Enough about the plot but isn't that the expression of utter freedom? Julie is really the composer of the new unified Europe anthem but she doesn't want to take the credit for it because it would take to much of her liberty away. She wouldn't be free any longer. Such altruism may be love, but even more so, an act done out of a will not to have any strings attached. Beautiful.The altruism pervades throughout. Julie gives, gives and gives. But she has received so much: her towering musical talents, beauty, sensitivity, wealth, so on and so forth. Kieslowski implies here that real freedom in life is achieved when you give back in return for what you have received. And Julie makes the ultimate gift; she gives away her personality, her fame to the men in her life as they become world renown instead of her. I know this may not be obvious to many but you will agree that this bring to the film a whole new layer of mystery plus loads of everything else. A MUST SEE. RUN",

A lot of questions were brought up in the film and none were answered and thats what makes this interesting and well made film aggravating. It is a film to be admired but the open holes make it hard to embrace. The one thing that cannot be denied is the terrific performance by Juliette Binoche. Even in a film that is hard to handle is watchable because of her. And this is a very good performance by her. Her character Julie is interesting as we watch her separate herself from her past and most of the outside world. But then she is slowly dragged back in. This film seems to be overrated by some critics and underrated by others. Its a very good film and an excellent performance, but those holes keep it from being more than that.",

            "content": "It took me three tries to get through this movie in its entirety. As someone who is currently going through a very difficult grieving process, it was particularly hard for me to watch the film.It all starts with a serious car accident where the main character, July, loses her husband and daughter. She, like myself, feels a need to escape, to isolate herself from others, and she almost annuls herself by not bearing the pain and absence of her lost family. As the film is a kind of metaphor around the concept of freedom, to what extent is it liberating to have these attitudes? I sincerely do not know. As much as we run away, our pains don't stop confronting us, we never stop being who we are.In the midst of all this, the film also launches considerations on the hopes and paths of the European Union project through the troubled completion of a symphony, commissioned by the Union and left incomplete upon the death of July's husband, who was its composer.I didn't know the director Krzysztof Kieslowski, and I believe that few people will. He is one of the directors who never leaves the festival circuit due to his enormous erudition. I don't believe, in fact, that he made films of a more commercial nature. This film won't please everyone, being relatively indigestible and uncomfortable, cold and depressing like the color that gives it its name. The cinematography is very talented, it is full of artistic resources, frames of great visual value and beauty, cold colors where blue predominates and is omnipresent in almost the entire work.We cannot fail to highlight the excellent interpretive performance given here by Juliette Binoche, in one of the most intense, poignant and strong cinematographic works of her career as an actress. Benoit Regent and Charlotte V\u00e9ry didn't do a bad job either, and each in their own way give a very important support to Binoche's work, but it is the main actress who, due to her enormous merit, sustains the film and really plays.I didn't want to stop writing a few lines about the soundtrack of this film: the film is not particularly sound, as the insertion of music is quite punctual, thought out and meticulously articulated with what we are seeing. And instead of using several melodies, or ordering a vast array of incidental pieces, the film uses only one song, which is called \"Song for the Unification of Europe\" and was composed by Zbigniew Preisner. Made in the period after the Treaty of Maastricht, the film is very \"Europeist\", which is ironic given the prevailing Euroscepticism nowadays, thirty years later.",

I loved it how her pain is not cinematically over exaggerated as many directors would have done. It was shown in simple and non close-up ways, such as Julie swallowing medical pills but spitting them out, because she simply could not do that. I think that's why I say this movie was so kind - because it was extremely honest. I believed Julie's reaction to her husband's mistress, I believed her character, and all else about her.I liked the use of the color blue in here. It was Julie's color. Especially the jar hanging from her ceiling and the blue of the pool. Those colors represented her inner world for me: very calm, but at the same time radiant.I loved how Julie felt the music. There was a black screen, music - and then we were thrown back into the world in the same place and time where we were left. This is quite a unique cinematic technique, as fade to black usually means a change in scene.And in general, the music here was magnificent.One thing I noticed is that in all three films of colors, something life changing first happens to the characters, and later they make an unexpected decisions, that leads to the situation of being stuck to ease out a little bit...",

That she succeeds in doing so illustrates the tremendous talent she possesses, although she is undoubtedly assisted by the ingenious use of editing, which combines brilliant displays of the colors blue and green, and music that transcends the screen and reaches the viewer's soul.",

However, she finds herself making new connections she can't seem to help but make. What a beautiful capture of humanity that is. Many of us would love to take advantage of a golden, if heartbreaking, opportunity to sever all ties. Yet the film presents a profound question: To what extent do we need human contact? Is it something even the most walled-off of us can do without?Blue is the perfect color for such a subject. It's a moody, quiet color that evokes water, which complements emotion in many ways. Kieslowski has made such a personal film, such a deeply personal insight which feels like, for him, it was bold. He parades proudly his telling story with a theme of powerful music.",

This film is a virtual festival of light and color, though set under a rather murky tone... everything one comes to expect from this auteur.For me the experience was most engaging because of the way he seemed to use colors to denote different types of space: red for dramatic space, green for outside space, white for balanced space, and of course blue for personal or internal space. Not to say that this holds directly throughout; green is also around a lot during natural and life-giving moments and blue is used so much and in so many shades that it can mean a lot of different things. However, of the trilogy, this is the movie that most saturates the colors, spreading them over a bright canvas and making it impossible to ignore.It's also the most abstract, starting with a non-literal composition and finishing with a broken and open ending.It is, at any rate, very enticing and beautiful. It's one of those films that can take as much time as it likes and one doesn't begrudge the extra minutes staring at a person wrestling with internal thoughts.--PolarisDiB",

Quite naturally, Julie is utterly grief-stricken. The rest of the story revolves around how she tries to shun away the grief by \"liberating\" herself from it..It's a simple story told in an almost poetic fashion by Krzysztof Kieslowski and Krzysztof Piesiewicz. Juliette Binoche delivers a stunning performance as the sorrowful Julie. The range of expressions she subtly displays is nothing short of fabulous! And of course, hats off to the Man himself, Mr. Kieslowski who has some little surprises here and there for us..including the very interesting way in which the next chapter in the trilogy crosses this story's path. Not to mention the use of symbolism throughout the film...the use of the colour Blue, and the superb manner in which all three colours of the French flag are shown in one particular quick scene....\"Blue\" is a superb beginning and an indication that the viewer is in for a treat in the following two films in the trilogy..",

            "review_title": "Freedom from and freedom to",
            "content": "In 1993 and 1994 Krzysztof Kieslowksi made a trilogy. This trilogy comprised both the colors of the French flag as the ideals of the French revolution.The first film is about the color blue and about the ideal of freedom. Central to the film is the distinction between freedom from (negative freedom) and freedom to (positive freedom).In a car accident a woman (Juliette Binoche) loses her husband and her daughter. After this trauma she loses the capability of feeling emotions and withdraws from the circle of friends she shared with her husband. This first half of the film stands for freedom from. In this part of the film the character of the woman has much in common with the character of Sol Nazerman (Rod Steiger) in \"The pawnbroker\" (1964, Sidney Lumet).At the moment of his death the husband (a composer) left behind an unfinished symphony. In the second half of the film the woman and the assistant of the man together finish the symphony and fall in love with each other in the proces. This part of the film obviously stands for freedom to.The color blue (cool) is associated more prominently with freedom from than with freedom to, for example in the scene that the woman is doing laps on her own in the otherwise empty swimming pool. Remarkable is that Hilary Mantel wrote a trilogy about the French revolution, \"A place of greater safety\". In the Dutch edition the part about freedom has a blue cover, the part about equality a white and the part about fraternity a red. The same associaton of colors and ideals that Kieslowski uses in his film trilogy.\"Trois couleurs, blue\" is a film with a lot of symbolism. To give just two examples. In the film the woman makes love to the assistent of her deceased husband twice. The first time to prove to herself that she really is incapable of feeling emotions (freedom from), the second time because she has once again find love (freedom to). Also the visit to her demented mother is soaked with symbolism. One person who don't want to forget and still does, the other person who wants to forget and isn't capable of.",

            "content": "\"Three Colors: Blue\" is a film about Julie (Juliette Binoche) loses her husband, a famous composer, and her young daughter in a car wreck. The film follows the weeks after this incident, and how she tries to cope with their deaths. It is a film about grief and loss, and the entirety of this film is spent focusing on Julie, and her enigmatic, but not too obscure thoughts and feelings during her grieving process. Towards the beginning, it seems she feels nothing. Her husband and daughter may have been the only people she really loved, so their death has forced Julie to stare into the void and contemplate the meaning of her existence, if there is any. She clearly wants to forget about them completely and try to start anew, selling all of their belongings that remind her of them, including her house, and moving away. She plays her husband's unfinished symphony, and when she gets to the unfinished emptiness, blue light crowds the screen and she is suddenly reminded of his death. She destroys her husband's unfinished symphony, believing it cannot possibly be finished by anyone because no one can replace him. She does, however, bring with her the blue light that was in one of her rooms, showing she doesn't yet have the strength to completely leave him behind.Blue is obviously a very important color in this film, and it often represents longing and loneliness when it is used. For instance, Julie often goes to the pool on her own, and the water is often illuminating blue. She keeps coming back to it because she can't move past her family's death, no matter how hard she tries. The only other family member she visits is her mother, who barely remembers who she is. The use of color is pretty ingenious in many scenes, with green also symbolizing content occasionally. The music enriches this sense of longing, with Julie's husband's unfinished symphony being used again and again, each time with the screen fading to black mid-scene and fading back to the same scene. This symphony is a constant reminder of his absence, and the hole this has caused in her life. The cinematography is restrained and beautiful, perfectly exploring this character that is so perfectly portrayed by Juliette Binoche. Her performance in this film is just restrained enough to give us a sense of her true feelings while also seeming constantly complex and interesting. The end is one that I will probably think about for a long time after viewing. There are hints that she may find a way to move past her grief, but there are also hits that she may never fully recover. It is clear that she wants to move past it, but continues to be pulled back down into her depression, and it seems part of her wants to continue thinking about him and wallowing in her misery forever, because it is all she has left to do. This is one of those rare films where the entire thing is a deep exploration of one character, almost through the visuals, editing, music, and Binoche's performance alone. There is a lot of symbolism to unpack and deliberate over. It truly takes a hold of the film medium to deliver a complex, thoughtful, and constantly mysterious study of one character dealing with grief. It's biggest strength is its incredibly enigmatic and unpredictable nature, yet this was occasionally a flaw upon first viewing. This is a film I will definitely watch more than once, that much I can say.",

This first instalment didn't fill me with anticipation for the other two. There just isn't much going on really. Juliette Binoche is a very attractive lady in that gamine way so beloved of the French, and there is no shortage of languid close-ups. The director is so obviously enamoured of his lead that one wonders about the scene behind the scenes. The direction is artfully tricky and contemplative but the story, as such, is so trite as to be soap-worthy. The preponderance of blue filter was also overdone: to my untrained eye; it seemed that a better director might have used location/lighting to create the effect more often than he did, (the pool), rather than relying on such a tired device. The relationship with the other composer is standard Mills&Boon, and the plot of the damaged sensitive heroine being brought out of the self-imposed shell of grief is similarly tired. The discovery of the mistress with child, and the rapprochement therewith, may seem to Anglo-Saxon eyes to be a revelatory dramatic device to illustrate the depth of her love for the dead husband and his son-to-be, and a self-discovery through forgiveness, but I didn't see it that way. I spent some time in France as a teenager, and cheerfully experienced at first hand the rather cavalier attitude of the locals to marital arrangements. It is considered quite acceptable, if not normal, to have a lover/mistress outside the marriage, and this has a social cachet, especially amongst the bourgeoisie. Therefore, to my, and I would assume a European eye, this climax (no pun) to the drama seemed a rather flat conclusion to a story that never really got out of the blocks to take us anywhere.

            "content": "A film on \"I Corinthians Chapter 13\", just as Kieslowski's \"Dekalog\" was based on \"the Ten Commandments\" The later works of Kieslowski never cease to amaze me. Here is a film so spiritual in content with no markings of being a cinematic essay based on an entire abstract chapter in the New Testament\u0097a chapter that could fit into the holy books of any religion and is not strictly limited to Christian theology but universal philosophy that could find equal acceptance by, say, a Sufi scholar or a Hindu mystic. But then Kieslowski made 10 marvelous short films called \"Dekalog\" each loosely based on one of the Ten Commandments. But if the viewer is not well versed with theology or philosophy, the film can be viewed as story far removed from such lofty heights. It would be a mere story of grief and reconciliation to loss of kin (but then Ingmar Bergman did a better job of this subject in the little known 1971 film \"The Touch\" or \"Beroringen\" with Bibi Andersson and Elliot Gould). Kieslowski, was a product of Communist Poland but a Christian in spirit and upbringing. He knew all of us had to make difficult moral choices in life constantly. Interestingly, Ingmar Bergman made another film taking a leaf from the very same Biblical chapter\u0097\"Through a glass darkly.\" In \"Blue,\" the moral choice the lead character makes is to love. Love whom, one may ask? Love the boy who makes a great effort to return the stolen necklace with a cross, the husband who cheated on her marriage, the mistress of her husband with his unborn son in her womb, the husband's colleague who seeks fame from adding final touches to another person's unfinished masterpiece, the unfinished musical work that needs a loving inspired end, love the neighbor who is a prostitute, the servants of the house, the mother in the old age home (most of the images are reinforced towards the end of the film, as excerpts from the Biblical chapter are sung). Ms. Binoche was able to allude to a faint smile at the last frame, the actor's contribution to the film after her understanding of the end of Anton Chekov's play \"The seagull.\" Kieslowski retained the contribution of the literate and sensitive actor.Blue--one of the three colors of the French flag. It is the color that defines melancholy in the English language. Blue is the \"untrue\" reflective color of water in a swimming pool\u0097a cathartic venue where the lead actor swims to rid her fear of rats, a venue that suggests purging of her past fears and marital shackles, a venue where she curls up like fetus in a womb to be reborn.There were unresolved passages in the film\u0097the despondent face of the daughter staring out of the car, the lead actor's obsessive interest in her dead husband rather than the loss of the daughter and why the mattress was the only furniture left behind in an otherwise empty house. Wish Kieslowski was alive today to explain these loose ends! The film is a superb example of sound editing, music composition and camera-work\u0097each technical department competing for top honors. \"Blue\" was made for Venice Festival just as \"White\" was made for Cannes and \"Red\" for Berlin\u0097the three top film festivals. Venice Festival loves such subjects as \"Blue\" presented\u0097\"Blue\" was designed for it, each shot from the dunking of the sugar cube to epiphany of the street flute player to the laceration of the hand (spiritual reference to shedding of blood?) on the stones in self mortification.In the final evaluation it is product of teamwork\u0097making a swansong triptych of a talented director who probably knew his time in this world was limited. If I had not seen Bergman's works mentioned earlier, I would have voted this film as the best of the trilogy. My vote therefore is for \"White,\" as it is more original in style and more complex of the two. Yet each of the \"three colors\" is a work of a master of cinema. I consider it a privilege to have met Kiesolowski briefly and talked to him, through an interpreter, in 1980, much before he had bloomed into a great filmmaker in the early Nineties. At that time he had only made \"Camera Buff\" with Jerzy Stuhr\u0097a film that impressed me but clearly lacked the maturity of his later works. Poland should to be proud of its great son.",

The half-conscious eye becomes prematurely aware of the death announcement. Almost before the woman realizes it, things have gone too far and it's impossible for her to back out from living damnation. So from an hospital bed of suffering a scream of anguish arises suddenly, seen as a peremptory withdrawal into an existence of immeasurable self solitude, as a controversial evidence of a disillusioned and insignificant future. There it is, the cathartic route to desolation row of a woman voluntarily immersed into voids of memory and determined to erase the past from her mind, doomed to cancel the loss of her family as a free self-imposition thank to the complete repudiation of every sentiments, as if her fate weren't discouraging enough.Julie's route is intended as a cry for freedom. As a release from musical reminiscences thrown into the dust-bin, from the possession of material things whose recollection can stop the healing of open wounds, from love involvements in the enclosed space of some anonymous, empty rooms. Julie's freedom is very heavy, it makes her perceive its oppressing presence every moments of her life, but on the other hand it helps her to empty her mind of every sad recollections of her past. But the line between pain and oblivion is very thin, and sometimes she doesn't even realize she's crossing it.Juliette Binoche puts her heart and brain (more the last one than the first one) into acting the disconsolate widow. Her performance is personally inspired by Annie Dupr\u00e9's book \"The black angel\", based on the death of the writer's parents in a car crash. Her character is damned to perpetual interior torment, into the BLUE, deprived of the faculty of emerging cathartically to light, necessary intermediate stage to reach a new existential balance.And we can find the BLUE everywhere. BLUE like the reflections of the swimming pool, faithful companion in solitude, relaxing amniotic liquid whose embrace is so welcoming! BLUE like the color of her empty room, once beaming with joy. BLUE like the chandelier, brought with her as the only memory of happy days gone by. BLUE like the notes of the scale that run after each other on the musical pentagram playing a growing hymn to love. But mainly BLUE as symbol of the cold void of the soul fallen on her back, temporarily deaf to the bells of life resounding around it.",

This time, the main heroine is impeccably performed by excellent Juliete Binoche and she plays with a mastery and skill that still admire after all these years. The film is truly blue, the main color scheme is really blue and then it suddenly turns to a Kislowski's most beloved honey yellow that it is a sheer pleasure to watch it. The main heroine suffers a death of her husband, a famous classical composer and her daughter in a car accident. She slowly starts to come back to life, and every time she has a real epiphany we hear a marvelous, deep, majestic music all around her. The woman becomes a new life, she sells her large house, buys a neat flat, meets new people and slowly returns to a normal way of life. She meets new neighbor, meets a former lover of her late husband, goes swimming... Life goes on, but up till the end, when she finally takes the work of writing the EU Anthem herself, that she finally comes back to this side of life. There are some very cool smaller details in the film - like, a bent old granny trashing the bottle, or a homeless flautist who anyway goes to his \"work\" in a luxurious car, or a scene of street fight late at night - everything is so sharp, precise and forms a full grand scale picture. The only slight minus of the film is a bit slower tempo that it really should have had, so that to make this work an absolute peak. However, this film stands out still...",

            "content": "I never go to the movie to see myself on screen. The movies, for me, are a tapestry of lives and actions that are foreign to my little world. Movies can be a window to lifestyle I will never experience and people that I will never meet. I have noticed that some people tend to form an opinion about a film based on the character's actions by comparison with their own. I prefer characters that deal with things in different ways. Krzysztof Kieslowski's Blue features just such a person.Her name is Julie (Juliet Binoche) and she lives in Paris with her husband and their daughter. Her family dies in an accident, leaving her in an emotional stalemate. The spaces of her life that were once populated by the vibrancy and energy of a busy life are now still and quiet. Long days of emptiness stretch on and on. What we come to expect from our usual patterns of this situation is that Julie will, with time, attempt to find a way to press on. Somewhere, we expect, she will end her loneliness and despair by starting over. This is not Julie's way. Thrust into this horrible situation, she becomes hardened. She throws away the life she had before, disposes of all memories of her family. She moves to another part of Paris where no one will recognize her. \"I have only one thing left to do,\" she says, \"Nothing. I don't want any belongings, any memories. No friends, no love. Those are all traps.\"Julie is played by Juliet Binoche and that makes Blue something special. Binoche is, of course, known for a variety of roles in films like Damage, The Unbearable Lightness of Being and her Oscar winning performance in The English Patient and what I have noticed is that she has one of the most expressive faces that I have ever seen. Even playing someone as callused as Julie, there is an emotion in her face and around her eyes that suggest everything that she won't outwardly reveal. In those other films she was able to express herself with her body and her voice. Here she keeps it all inside so we read her beautiful eyes for the turmoil within.We don't know everything about Julie's past but from the pain in those eye we can guess that her marriage was not sunshine and roses. Indeed through the film we get clues to her unhappy life then and now. Julie does things to assess that her numbness from grief doesn't mean that she will never feel again. After the accident she goes and has sex with a man who was a friend of her husband. If this scene is shocking to you then you've missed the point.Many movies begin by making everything clear and laying the entire plot on the table before our theater seats are even warm. 'Blue' is different, it follows a woman's journey to deal with grief in her own way. She doesn't always do things that make us happy as viewers. Blue is about a woman who has become cold to the world around her through the numbness of grief.",

It follows the first six or seven months of a widow's life after losing her husband, a famous composer, and her daughter in an automobile accident.The movie begins with the fateful accident. Julie (Juliette Binoche) is too injured to attend the joint funeral of her famous husband, Patrice, and her five-year-old daughter, Anna. She returns to their country home, sells all the furniture, and tries to destroy the uncompleted score her husband was creating for the new European Union. After an enigmatic liaison with Olivier (Beno\u00eet R\u00e9gent), her husband's closest collaborator, she disappears into Paris to silently absorb her loss.While there she is occasionally reminded of her past and builds a modest relationship with a sex worker, Lucille (Charlotte V\u00e9ry) who lives in the same building. Olivier tracks her down, but she puts him off until she later learns he has a copy of the uncompleted score and is trying to complete it. She also learns her husband had a mistress, Sandrine (Florence Pernel), who is pregnant with Patrice's child.The film then resolves Julie's relationship with Olivier and with Sandrine.This is a beautifully filmed (cinematography by Slawomir Idziak) story. The \"blue\" theme resonates throughout. The storyline is melancholy but struck me as truthful about one response to the painful death of loved ones. Juliette Binoche is both beautiful and talented; some of the other characters did not make as strong an impact.",

Fortunately she is extremely wealthy \u0096 her husband was a world famous composer - in fact we are led to believe she wrote his stuff for him. This had me groaning - the woman's existence is on such impossibly ethereal plane that it undermines the emotional core of the film - the old problem of watching someone suffering who has less excuse for suffering than most. Far more tragic, surely, if they had been struggling and she had been left penniless, but then, Kieslowski is clearly only interested in dealing with refined, precious people - even his Dekalog series dealt mainly with doctors, lawyers, professors and suchlike \u0096 it's probably significant that my favourite episode deals with a taxi driver (though not the murdered one). As a result of the socio-economic distancing, Binoche's post-crash trauma is too indulgent, too minutely detailed, too drawn out. The sterile affair she then has with her husband's associate seems predictable, and the salvation achieved in the latter part of the film when she takes to working on the music is only banal.There are some nice things here though. The sense of throwing everything up and withdrawing from the world (\"I have only one thing left to do. Nothing.\") is something rare and valuable in film. The scene with the rats nest is memorable \u0096 it was perhaps the moment in which we can relate to her most. But on the whole, Binoche's character is a priggish, hard-headed, snooty bore, too willful and self-controlled, too wealthy and too preternaturally talented to be of much interest. No doubt Kieslowski was chummy with world famous composers who live in country mansions the size of small citadels and who have wives as tasty and accomplished as Juliette Binoche. The rest of us have to put up with real world.",

Above all the heavy layers of symbolism and social commentary - which, I admit, were a bit too heavy-handed for my taste - there's a simple and touching drama about grief, loss and recuperation. Beautifully shot, beautifully edited, and played out with subtle and minimalistic perfection by Juliette Binoche.Most of all, stylistically, Blue excels in its juxtaposition of image and music, and it does so on almost every shot. Some of the elements that try for symbolism felt to me like they try too hard - the excessive use of blue colors, or the brief blackouts. But at its quietest, simplest moments, the music and image compliment each other to create a perfect mood, and cinema at its purest.",

            "content": "Contains spoilers, please do not read unless you've seen this movie.I have debated in the past whether this movie or Vertigo is greater, as both of them are profound studies of the human experiences of obsession, loss and pain, and can be watched again and again, always revealing new things. Citizen Kane is considered to be the greatest movie ever made but I would say that both Blue and Vertigo are as great in their masterful use of all the techniques of movie making, and their timeless stories of love and loss. Unlike the other two, Blue does not end with despair but with redemption and hope; therefore it is more satisfying.Blue, unlike the necessarily complicated story-telling of the other two movies, is simple and straightforward, and the heaviness is in its assault on the senses and emotions, using the cinematography plus the musical score which gradually unfolds. Like a siren coming clearer as it draws nearer the despair gives way to acceptance and a new life for the one who mourns, using the materials at hand in her life. It is matter of fact to this woman that there is no other way than to withdraw from life and then to be forced, by one's own nature, to participate again.I first rented Blue in 1994 and watched it at my friend's house. Then I rented it again several times over the years, and the last time in particular about two years ago, I was powerfully moved, even though I had no loss in my life at the time. Today I watched it again because my friend has died and I hoped it would help me through this time. As always I was moved by the story itself but in a new way because I remembered the tears I wept the last time I saw it, and the powerful way it affected me the first time I saw it at my friend's house when everything was all right and it was only a movie, and I didn't know that one day I would be weeping for him as I watched it. I can only say it is a good movie to see to prepare yourself for the inevitable loss of loved ones, and also cathartic to watch when that loss has happened to you.One thing that surprised me was that this copy did not translate into subtitles the Greek chorus, which is the love chapter of Corinthians. Every other time I saw it the words were printed which added to the emotional impact of the final scenes. For those who don't know Greek, that is as vital as giving subtitles for the French. Only because I saw it before did I know what they were singing which is the whole message of the film. The emotional impact of that end is unparalleled in cinema.I cannot say that about Red and White, although they are brilliant too, of course. Blue simply outshines them in every way, though they should be watched as part of the trilogy for they also have important messages and are beautifully made.",

It's probably one of those movies that get better with time and multiple viewings. There is a lot of symbolism and connections between the images and themes... like, what does the color blue represent in different scenes. Perhaps a bit too artsy and metaphorical for my taste but it kind of pays off in the end.The story is about the main character trying to cope with her grief after the loss of her family. I think the movie leaves a lot of room for interpretation, like, what's the viewer's own life story might also affect a lot on how to understand the film.Overall it's not the kind of movie I usually watch, but pretty interesting drama.

            "review_title": "Poignantly composed and sublimely acted drama",
            "content": "'Three Colors: Blue' is the first of the trilogy by Krzysztof Kieslowski, a Polish director who wants to convey the French motto of 'Liberty, Equality and Fraternity' through his trilogy, this one taking Liberty as its influence. However, the director's approach is through human emotions rather than political or economic commentary, giving a depth and a Shakespearean complexity to the movie. As Roger Ebert rightly observed, the film is sparse in dialogs and inconspicuous in showing direct emotions but it gives the viewer a chance to ponder and decipher the protagonist's emotions. The silences aren't too long but the viewer can sense the invisible rays coming from Binoche, for example when she enters her house after her husband and child's death, or when she sits at the cafeteria, and the camera focuses on her face. Juliette convincingly manages to underplay such scenes, and that gives more gravity to her emotions and performance.The plot is simple and revolves around Julie, the wife of a famous composer who along with his child dies in an car crash while Julie survives. Julie wakes up in the hospital, with the camera focusing on her pupils and the reflection of the doctor who informs her about the tragedy. The eyes shed no tear, though Julie's lips quiver and her heart is shattered. She tries committing suicide but cannot, but this results in prolonged psychological suffering as she suddenly decided to leave behind everything and start afresh. She remains cold and apathetic to everything and this disturbs her the most, and she shuns everyone around her, destroys her husband's possessions, makes love to her husband's friend and fellow composer and lives in a hotel. The only instrument she cannot obliterate is the music in her mind, which keeps confronting her to face reality and move on.Three Colors: Blue is a highly polished film, clocking at one and half hours exactly. To me the movie was flawlessly paced like a symphony- maintaining the atmosphere while playing the notes continuously without stopping. I never found it to be too long or boring, because there is genuinity in the movie, which I found completely lacking in the recent claptrap 'Sucker Punch' which claimed to be complex and artsy, but to me was a hack. I was completely flabbergasted when some viewers were discussing the great art behind the pretentious and opaque 'Sucker Punch'. Blue on the other hand is sublime and realistic- did Julie ever seem pretentious or overbearing to me? No, in fact Juliette portrays her with such truthfulness that I felt a unbroken line in her performance that's seldom found in movies these days. Part of the credit goes to Krzysztov who uses the camera so effectively on her.The movie apart from its constant references to the title, also has the elements of red and white finely embedded in it. For example, when the prostitute friend of Julie thanks her for refusing to sign the list to throw the former our to 'keep the society clean', she brings white flowers, a symbol of equality. Also, one could find how the lady who requests Julie to sign the list was being deceived by her own licentious husband in the previous scene where he spends the night with the same prostitute (He was the lady's husband, right?). Also, when Julie helps the prostitute in the brothel, the screen becomes red, indicating kinship and sisterhood. Howeve, blue dominates the background whether its the pen used by Julie, or the curios, the swimming pool, the door, the prostitute friend Lucille's overcoat, Patrice's room etc. And never for a moment does it completely dominate the foreground, in fact it subtly rests in the background to reinforce the idea of liberty.In fact, Julie gets freedom but in order to continue her normal life, she has to rely on her past, as her past influences her. I feel that apart from liberty, the movie pays highlight to influence. I take my country's example. India got independence in 1947, yet it has its British influences. Even though Goa is now free from Portugal's rule over it, it cannot obliterate its past completely as its past keeps influencing it. Take the case of the pauper in the movie who plays his flute on the streets. When Julie places his flute case below his head, he says 'You always got to hold on to something'. In this case, its the music which Julie composed during happier times. Or her scene with the rats, where she is distraught to see the babies being killed, reminding her of her dear child.The only slight complaint I have with the movie is the final scene where Julie actually sheds a tear, or rather two. For some reason, after going through so much internal pain and struggle just to realize that husband was not faithful to her, and then getting her redemption towards the end, I felt that a stolid face with a tear trickling slowly down Julie's face didn't do much justice and made the scene rather distant. Krzysztof could have injected a trickle of positive melodrama by making her break down in tears. But that's my personal opinion.I have to disagree with the comment on the poster of the film saying that the movie is 'Mysterious... Sexy!'. To me, its relatable, touching, gritty, compelling and beautiful. My rating: 9.5/10",

            "content": "The cover of the box in which this movie comes says \"Mysterious.  Sexy.\" Blue is not really either one.  It is very straightforward, and sexual where appropriate, but not at all sexy.  It is very pretty, and it is very, very intense.My American prejudice forces me to assume that any movie in French will be visually stimulating.  I expect gorgeous locations, pretty people not necessarily model-perfect but dripping with style, and fabulous scene compositions.  In this aspect, Blue certainly does not disappoint.  Blue is also extremely well-acted, and overall a touching, sensitive, and honest exploration of grief.  However, the aspect I most want to comment on is the way sound, particularly music, is implemented in this film.  It's absolutely ingenious.Most films addressing dramatic events or tough emotional situations seem nowadays to hammer in their points with overblown music -- violins for sentiment, bassoons for majestic landscapes, drums for suspense and action. Audiences are not allowed to simply let the experiences the actors are delivering wash over us and sink in naturally; we must constantly be ordered to notice each nuance through the insistent blare of overweening musical backup.  The most refreshing aspect of Blue is that it does not do this at all.Natural ambient sound is the most frequent background in Blue.  This is shockingly effective.  Ordinary noise -- traffic, or the sounds of a person moving around a room alone -- provide all the atmosphere necessary to make us feel what is being conveyed.  Surprising sounds surprise us.  Startling noises startle us.  We feel everything that each sound makes each character feel, because we have experienced it in exactly the same way.The only place that the very wonderful music is used is when the protagonist or another character of the world of music thinks.  The protagonist is a musical woman, a composer and a composer's wife, and it is perfectly right that she should feel and think everything first in music.  When she or someone else reads music, we hear what is being read, just like a voiceover. When the protagonist is impacted by an image, an utterance, or a memory, we are impacted by the musical chords by which her mind and heart respond first.This is not only very effective, but it's also very respectful of the actors and of the audience.  I have never, ever had the pleasure of a film experience like this before.  Although the film falls apart a little at the end, rushing where it shouldn't and turning slightly derivative of Wings of Desire, and although it's probably not a movie I'd watch twice since half its impact is based on not knowing what will happen next, it is a very good film and definitely worth watching just for this amazing experience of hearing music and sound handled so expertly and with such dignity.",

Kieslowski's ideas -- about \"libert\u00e9\", grief, love, the need to not be completely free of connectedness to others -- are very close to the surface.

Witness the sequence, when she finally feels able to step out into the world again and move into the city after the accident. She rents an apartment on an upper floor of a large, strange vacuous building, and there, that first night, through her window, witnesses the beating of a man on the street, who escapes and runs into her building, the fear on her face, as she listens to him climb the long metal escape stairway, floor by floor, still followed by his assailants, as he comes closer to her could be something out of Hitchcock, but it goes much deeper than primal fear because of everything she has gone through and is trying to recover from.Still, it is not only the imagery (Binoche blurry through window, staring vacantly somewhere as she experiences intimate relations for the first time since the accident), or ambient sound (the sudden clamor and echo of the indoor swimming pool as she comes up for air from under water) that reflects the nature of her psyche, but Preisner's haunting music that simultaneously takes us back to her husband and her tragedy, as much as towards her recovery of self as she engages her creative process. She is a woman who has lived in the shadow of her husband, while yet participating in the creation of the very music he is famous for, and as the music enters the film, each time, it is her reflecting on and coming to terms with all that it represents to her, including, finally, the bridge to her salvation....This is not a typical Hollywood redemption tale handing us the standard prescription for such a tale of woe, no \"how to reclaim your power as a woman course 101.\" This is a tale of truth, and we believe Binoche every time she makes a decision because we are not only privy to her experience, but fully involved in the process of transformation that becomes her liberation.",

She seemed unfeeling to everything (which is fine if she chooses to live her life like that) and it was hard to see her destroyed over killing innocent mice but not over her child. Then, I was wondering if I was going to see the \"tangled web of lies and passion\" the stupid back of the video box promise. I got this half-baked idea that didn't pan out anywhere that I could have inferred from the first 5 minutes of the film. Maybe a re-watch is in order for this \"just okay\" film.",

The rest of the trilogy is just as mind-boggling in its brilliance, tenderly radical in its visual determination. But this! Nonpareil filmmaking only equaled in the past 20 years by Wong, Malick, Tarr and the Brothers Quay.Kieslowski sees beautifully: organically, rooted in true presence of not only the characters but us; us not only as observers but as participants. He does not only show but truly takes us there, not only refers to emotion but charges each image and sound abundantly with that which we may recognize in ourselves. Reciprocally, not patronizingly, so effortlessly.The smallest of objects become amplified in their significance, and this way Kieslowski and Tarkovsky are alike: the objects are given life much richer than what they usually are as simple d\u00e9cor. They are given memories and this makes them alive for us, since we can see them interface with the people inhabiting this lonely space.This film in particular speaks to me with such force because three things in particular it shares with me that I can share with it: music, family and death. All this in a work of art that exhibits powerful visual ingenuity and radical rethinking of the use of sound and image.",

Juliette Binoche is fabulous as Julie, she carries the whole movie with her believable performance. Krzysztof Kieslowski's direction is superb, he lets us see the world the way Julie sees it.

Beautiful Juliette Binoche plays, wonderfully, a beautiful, both inside and outside, woman. I have sympathized with her character. Both the idea of the movie and the point at the end are very clear, and portrayed very well. In contrast to other movies where we have some turn in the plot, here we have a turn (change) in the character. So this is mostly a character driven movie.There are lots of concentrations on blue chandelier, blue swimming pool, showing Julie relaxing herself. Such accent on the art made a compromise in the plot. So there was not much going on. For an hour and a half movie, it felt slightly longer than necessary. Still, it was beautiful and well played.",

The appearances aren't substantive and add little the underlying stories, but they are fun to see.Blue is beautiful and sad. The viewer watches Juliet Binnoche process the tragic loss of her family. The loss is routine, mundane without a real villain to blame. We watch her process a profound loss which takes her outside her daily life.She and her husband were composers, and the soundtrack becomes a central part of the story. It is a wonderful soundtrack befitting its importance to the story.The cinematography is stunning, as is Ms. Binnoche's acting.This is a rare jewel.

Juliet Binoche gives an Oscar caliber performance as the grieving Julie Vignon who has lost both her daugther and husband in a car accident. She performs on so many different dimensions it is hard to describe. Ahh, the music! It was beautiful. From the street performer and his flute to the orchestras going on in Juliet's head to the operatic ending. I don't think music has affected me this deeply in any movie before.

I don't like movies that I have to watch several times just to understand 'everything the director is trying to say'; if a director isn't able to clearly convey what he/she wants us to feel, maybe they're in the wrong business.

In Blue I felt like I was Julie, I felt like I was seeing what Julie was seeing, I felt like I was listening to what Julie was listening, and that's the beauty of the film.I loved how the movie's name is Blue and you will notice that in nearly every single scene / shot the color blue or at least a certain shade of the color Blue is there even if it's a small thing like a sign in a street or a shirt that a character is wearing, blue is just always there and you will know why the color Blue has a big effect on Julie and it takes on deferent meanings to match Julie's emotions. The Cinematography & colors were just so beautiful and pure.The Production design was so amazing, the beautiful streets of France, the swimming pool, and Julie's apartment, it just gives you that weird grief feeling that Julie is feeling inside of her.The incredible score (the symphony) that was so weird, full of emotions and starts to play suddenly, I loved how in some scenes pieces of the symphony suddenly play over the soundtrack at emotional moments and how Julie seems to hear it as if it's surging up from inside her own mind, also the scene when she throws the sheet music into the garbage truck if you listen closely, the song distorts as the trash compactor's teeth tear the paper. We are hearing everything exactly the way that Julie is hearing.Juliette Binoche's performance was so crazy, she didn't have many lines in the film and she rarely speaks but, she was able to give us such a deep performance as her character navigates grief, in one of the scenes that I can't mention or I'll spoil the movie, Juliette Binoche was able to play Julie's hurt and anger, but also her curiosity and maybe even envy all at once. She was just incredible and was able to act with her facial expressions more than with her speaking or saying some words.An amazing movie that I really enjoyed and highly recommend it.My rating is: 8/10(credits go to: \"CrashCourse\" from youtube for their video: \"Three Colors - Blue: Crash Course Film Criticism #11\")",

Being the first in Kieslowski's series of films about contemporary French culture, it was naturally the first and (up to this point) the only one that I've seen.It is visually perfect: Kieslowski's direction, his attention to detail and his sheer style ring truer here than in Amator, the only other of his films that I've witnessed. He also manages to extract a marvellous performance out of Juliette Binoche who portrays a female composer dealing with the tragic and unexpected death of her husband and her child, basically without grieving. She's essentially a fairly frustrating character, comparable to the character of Stephane from another great French flick, Un Coeur en Hiver. She effectively isolates herself from painful feeling by similarly isolating herself from the people around her and from her music. The onscreen result is brilliantly sad in the way it is portrayed, however it is unfortunately quite thin, and at times a little slow.The overall effect, then, is not exactly a film to sit down and watch repeatedly. Once is enough, and you can feel happy that you've watched a master at work. But like I've said about other films, Trois Couleurs: Bleu is far more of an exercise in artistic filmmaking than just a film. You can scrutinise it, analyse it and appreciate it for all its brilliance but not watch it 'just for fun'. I'm not saying this is a bad thing, because it sure isn't. It's wonderful that there are films out there like this that care far more about artistic merit than taking the audience 'for a ride', it will always help to expand the range of cinema. And while I may often sit down to enjoy a high-explosive Van-Damme popcorn flick, it's far more of a delight to see a tale like this being brought to life with such exceptional quality.****1/2 / *****",

I truly admired Krzysztof Kieslowski's approach with the film as filmmakers these days seem to try their best to cater towards the audience's expectations and resolve the character's story the way that is acceptable for them, which at times hurt the film's emotional and thematic impact. The film doesn't let us get too close to our protagonist, Julie, we never at any moment get inside her head, we only have her actions and her words to shape our perspective of her and I think this approach kind of left me a tad bit detached at some moments and finding it hard to empathise, but I think the director wanted us to not let the film speak itself too frankly, he wants us to keep coming back and observing her, hoping that each visit would let us become closer to the character and develop a unique understanding of who she is, what she is feeling, and how she would get through it.The film also explores Julie's coping mechanism of her depression and grief. Julie's way of coping is definitely not something a psychiatrist or counsellor would recommend as her remedy is to isolate herself from the objects that could bring about memories of her loved ones. Julie also engages herself in activities like swimming, which at first I thought was her way of distracting herself from the recurring thoughts of her family, as the film went on I started to see what Kieslowski was trying to create with those scenes, she is swimming in her sadness and at times drowning herself in it. This held me back in thinking she is close to moving on with her life, but since the director is going for something more realistic in dealing with depression, I was more willing to let myself accept the decisions that the characters make. Throughout the late second-third act of the film, we are treated to a side of Julie that wasn't primarily seen at the start of the film. We get to see her immerse herself in the art of music, which I found to be highly entertaining as this gives us a glimpse of what she used to be and how talented she was before the tragic event.I cannot go into high subjective detail on the film's cinematography as I feel that I need to go through this once more before I could properly criticize the choices that both the director and cinematographer have taken. All I could say for now is that the photography of the film captures that distance between us and the protagonist perfectly, no matter how close the camera is we could never fully penetrate her. There were a couple of times where I did feel the use of the color blue was a bit too emphasised in a couple of shots, but then over time I was able to get through it and appreciate it's usage, particularly the scenes that involves Julie swimming in the large pool. The film at times switches between mounted and stable shots to hand held tracking shots. The director is manipulating how much of the character we see, there are times where the film lets us in and at times we only see partially or are too far away from the character.The film's score was a definitely one of the film's highlights as the score creates this sense of impact during particular moments in the film, accurately representing how she feels at that given moment. The film was clever enough to have the film's protagonist be aware of the music, as the music seems to play as a reminder of the event and at the same time a sense of inspiration in how his husband's magnum opus composition should turn out. Since both the protagonist and the audience can hear the music, we are able to feel a sense of empathy, which is something of a rarity throughout the film.The film's acting was mainly anchored by Juliette Binoche and she does a wonderful job here. I have only seen the actress on Abbas Kiarostami's Certified Copy which I thought she did a great job with, but her performance in this film took my perspective of her even further. Binoche is an outstanding actress who definitely deserves more credit than she currently has as when he embodies a role, she does it with such precision that one's previous understanding of the actress would be wiped clean when starting a new film. Just on scenes where the camera captures a close up of her face, she doesn't reveal much but it definitely does not seem hollow, there is something there but one has to look harder in order to obtain it.Blue is a great film that contains a wonderful and powerful performance from Juliette Binoche and a story that avoids from being predictable. If one places an effort to understand and connect with the character, then one would be left highly rewarded by the end of the film.",

            "content": "\"Now I have only one thing left to do: nothing. I don't want any belongings, any memories. No friends, no love. Those are all traps.\" Krzysztof Kie\u015blowski's 1993 French drama film 'Three Colors: Blue' is one of three films from the Three Colors trilogy (all directed by Kie\u015blowski, the other colors being White and Red), depicting the first color in the French flag, standing for liberty. But how does the first installment of this trilogy series play out? Let's take a look. The film tells the story of a beautiful young woman named Julie (Juliette Binoche) who survives a car crash while tragically losing her musician husband and daughter and later on becomes haunted by grief. Filled with remorse and bitterness, she tries to shut out memories of the past and the world itself to melt into her own misery, at one point indulging herself in trying to swallow a capsule of pills, another by scraping her bare knuckles against a stone wall as she walks along, drawing blood. In a close-up shot for one scene in a caf\u00e9, we see her dipping a sugar cube in some coffee, showing us how once something pure can quickly become stained as her life had now become. Certain sounds amplify the story at certain and are key, allowing the film to breathe in a sense as would the incomplete piece her former husband wrote with its beats, tempos and musical nuances or as any other arrangements of composed music as well. Besides the many things being blue that are in this film, the primary focus are what we as the audience will either sense or feel throughout. Whenever Julie encounters a friend from the past, the screen fades to black and we hear a chord from her husband's unfinished symphony. Moments later the screen fades in again and we return to the scene at hand. Here we are to experience the emptiness of this character's psyche for a brief moment and her yearning to be set free from what has ensnared her being. We hear more than we see rather; her inner anguish writhing within followed by the sudden oomph from the full orchestra whenever it fades to black. This happens two or three times more in the film; fading to the darkness for an instant, the chord of a symphony and then fading back in. When something is repeated it is usually for emphasis, and in this particular scenario the director allows sound as well as sight to flourish in volumes. To the sound of a homeless street performer droning her deceased spouse's tune on a recorder to almost being able to smell the hot coffee in a local caf\u00e9, this picture is truly a film for the senses. 'Blue' weaves a mysterious orchestra of senses and emotions together all on its own to capture the essence of grief, loss and the uncertain bonds that must be mended regarding the present state and the future.",

            "content": "The theme of grief is one of the most complicated ones to elaborate, which is often explored through poetry and philosophy; they both usually give specific details, about what kind of meaning the grief might has. Some authors might describe the grief as the meaning of a burden, which must be lately thrown away, to feel the freedom again; while other authors might describe the grief as the meaning of something, which must be reflected about the mistakes committed by anyone, who try to search answers to see how far the grief will go. The auteur filmmaker Krzysztof Kieslowski has been interested, to explore this theme; to connect it with one of the three colors of the French flag, which is the blue one that represents freedom. In 1993 came out Trois Couleurs: Bleu by Krzysztof Kieslowski with Juliette Binoche and Beno\u00eet R\u00e9gent. The movie's plot: After a tragic auto wreck, Julie (Juliette Binoche) is filled with grief in her soul, as she has been told her composer husband and her daughter died from the accident. Julie tries to free herself from the grief, by thrown everything away which is connected with her husband's work and other precious objects. She even tries to avoid to have interactions with anybody around, until her old friend Olivier (Beno\u00eet R\u00e9gent) would bring her back to the reality; he would show her, how important it is to have interactions again. The movie shows to be visually captivating, to tell a complicated thoughtful theme, from the beginning to the end, without breaking the narration's rhythm. Even the movie has some missing essential details, to connect its themes with a specific context, which could have been reflected about one specific impactful event, which can be considered relevant with contemporary events. The production designer Claude Lenoir has build the different settings of the story, which the spaces are filled with specific objects and the colors, especially the blue one, to connect with the themes of the movie. Especially to connect with the feelings of the main character, as the spaces and the colors of the settings change, from being initially dark to lately become brighter. The cinematographer Slawomir Idziak has captured some shots to be fundamentally essential, in every camera movements as well as in every angle shots; the camera has been used in the most precise way, to be helped by the lighting, which creates some unique frames to be visually creative. The editor Jacques Witta has elaborated the narration's rhythm, which edits together different shots in the most precise way; some of the most essential frames, which have been edited together, create some of the most poetic sequences. The score by Zbigniew Preisner has been elaborated with musical notes, which describe the emotions of the main character and the themes of the movie, in the most precise way; the musical notes surprise the audience, in some of the most unexpected moments of the movie, by elevating the emotions of the sequences. Juliette Binoche did an excellent performance as Julie, a widow who tries to be free from the grief which is consuming her; once she finds a way to be free from the grief, she would find a way to understand how important it is to have the interaction again. Even there should have been more details about, if Julie has any kind of wishes, to have done more for her husband and her daughter, before the accident; some specific details on the things she hated at most about her husband, while she is suffering and tries to get rid off the grief; the specific details of the happiest memories Julie would lately regain, after she finds what she needed at most. Beno\u00eet R\u00e9gent did a well done performance as Olivier, an old friend of Julie who would lately help her to find the most essential things she was searching to regain. Even there should have been more details about, if Olivier shares some memories he has on Julie's husband and if there are things he misses about the composer; the purposes Olivier wishes at most to have accomplished, but he regrets to have not done; if he has any kind of regrets to have not said to Julie, before she got married. Trois Couleurs: Bleu is one of the most important movies with unique poetic moments, even the movie did not used enough essential elements to be a complete story.",

And when the widow, (shall we call her Ms. Blue? I don't remember her name) Ms. Blue, is given the cue for reflection (such as when waiting in the dark for an entire minute, deliberating on whether to open her apartment door to check on the remnants of a street fight), the actress \"reflects\" well -- but to what end? We get the feeling that Kieslowski is making a feature film from the pieces of a short film (what would be a fantastic short film!) and must slather a coat of cinematic, slow \"art house\" \"reflective\" paint over the missing pieces to hit a 80+ minute running time. Perhaps to make the film eligible for awards.It is a wonderful film, especially visually; unforgettable are the ultramarine swimming pool and a sugar cube absorbing coffee. But sugar cubes and swimming pools alone don't make for a feature film. The dramatic weight just isn't there, and the freshness of the visuals certainly don't mend the paucity.",

            "content": "\"Blue\" (along with \"White\" and \"Red\") is a cinematic masterpiece and one of (if not the) most innovative and powerful films of the 90s. Director-writer Krzysztof Kieslowski suggests an anti-climactic approach to a more visual interpretation of both physical and mental pain. How does one cope with loss of a loved one? How do we continue living if we're totally alone? Kieslowski forms a narrative around the characters in the story, and around their whole existence. Although the story is a deep focus of the heroine or protagonist, it shows the world both through and outside of her eyes.Juliette Binoche stars as Julie, a successful woman who has everything one would ever want, until one day when driving in a car with her family, the car crashes killing both her husband and daughter. After losing her family, Julie detaches herself from any memories, thoughts, and pain by giving up everything she's ever wanted, and starting a new life in an obscure area. Julie's deep passion always was and will be with music, and through her subconscious the music comes back and reminds her that she once was a happy woman.In the first five minutes of the movie you're completely hypnotized. It opens up with a closeup shot of a wheel from a car spinning on the street as the car drives. The cinematography sucks you in and almost foreshadows a more saddening mood, suggesting this road ends before the car reaches the destination. We're only shown the back of the characters in the car and we're left with very little to think about in terms of their psychology. Kieslowski knew exactly what he was doing by opening the scene in such a way. When the car crashes (in the most detailed and realistic crash scene I've ever seen), the movie cuts to a closeup of someone's eye in which we can see a man's reflection. We automatically know we are inside someone's head and that they are almost too tired to look at the man. Kieslowski's incredibly cinematic opening scene is just the beginning of a visually stunning and deep film.The eye is that of Julie's, who's lying in bed as the man tells her that her husband and her daughter are dead. We expect a big scene where the woman breaks down, smashing everything around her in a dramatic attempt to kill herself. But all we see is her shift her head and we know that she's suffering without having to show it. The idea of \"Blue\" is to question whether or not someone can start over and heal without going through the mourning process. We are lead to believe that Julie can, but something always comes back and reminds us that maybe we are wrong. Some scenes create this illusion by having the picture fade to black as we hear music then fades back to the picture. We all know that a technique in editing where fading to black is used to represent passage of time. But in this situation, it's nothing of the sort. Julie constantly blocks any memory from her mind, but the mind always pushes those memories out. Her husband was a composer and the music she suddenly hears is both a reflection of her past and a reminder to her that she is still alive.Every minute of the movie we are exposed to the pain that Julie is experiencing. This is more of a statement than it is an expression though, since Kieslowski uses magnificent techniques to draw out this emotion. In one scene, Julie is swimming in a pool (where she goes every night to let out her physical energy so that she doesn't explode with everything she's been keeping in), and her husband's music starts playing in her head. She pauses and allows herself to sway back into the pool, in the part of it that represents death. Juliette Binoche describes this as a form of a fetus who's not yet pushed into the real world.Kieslowski loves to pay attention to detail. Everything that's on the screen is a form of reality and a symbol of pain, suffering and isolation. For example, the scene in which Julie is in a restaurant drinking coffee exemplified just how much this woman is emotionally constricted. She hears music that she and her husband wrote, and she automatically shelters herself away from it, to disallow herself to have her memories come back. She quietly puts a cube into her coffee and watches the sugar turn brown. To some extent this is a perfect example of how not only Julie is withdrawn from life and others, but so are we, the audience.There's no doubt that this allegory is a masterpiece in film-making. Kieslowski often moves in and out of the frame with the camera, showing us a world that we're meant to see, instead of just placing an element in a frame and keeping it there to blatantly smack us with the message. To some, \"Blue\" is a masterpiece and to me it's also inspiration. Everything from its incredible cinematography to the haunting and memorable score, is flawless. Whether or not \"Blue\" is the least favorite of the trilogy, it comes in at my list (and many other's) as one of the best movies of all time.",

While Juliette Binoches performance is outstanding in what ultimately is a one woman show, I cannot help but feel it peculiar that Julie's icy cold callousness and brooding can last quite so long into the film. Certain scenes like that of the mice in her apartment also feel as if they serve no purpose. Despite this, there is no doubt that the director is at the top of his game. The technical execution of this film is simply sublime- the camera acts almost as if it were a being with agency and purpose, every shot is pitch perfect. The directors use of the colour blue, through blue reflections, a blue foil, or some blue beads is both clever and artful. The music used is also superb, where the natural diegetic sounds are suddenly interrupted by stirring notes of the score for dramatic effect. These three techniques- the camera, the music and the acting- communicated information on emotions, motivations, and plot, whereas other films may rely solely on dialogue to do the same. Regardless, I must say the film sometimes leaves too much to be implied and too less to be explicitly communicated through dialogue, leaving some things more nebulous than I would have liked. It ought to be remembered that Three colours blue is, all being said, still an art film which might rely too much on \"show, not tell\" for a general movie audience.",

She was free of her family responsibilities after the death of Patrice and Anna, but only to do nothing about building a new life.

Really, I found it beautiful, aesthetically and on the acting level (yes, I agree with everybody on the fact that Binoche is wonderful). But it was quite boring; especially it was so long to really start, but I guess it's how grieving is, long and boring. So people die, survivors survive: OK, life goes on, we know that. Therefore I started White with a bit of apprehension, and finally was really caught quickly. I will even dare saying it's somewhat Kusturician. Is it because it's mainly base in Eastern Europe that I have this feeling, or is Eastern European genuinely crazier and more surreal than us? I guess the fact that Eastern Europe had a lot to catch up with Western Europe at the time of the film allowed to use crazy ideas as importing a dead body from Russia to fake your own death. Apart that, I was really interested by this man who couldn't satisfy his wife as long as they were married, and could start doing it again as soon as he was supposed to be dead, meaning as soon as any commitment was impossible. Power, commitment and sexuality: such a millenary-old story. After this Red could have been a bit boring too, but it was very intriguing so it compensated the absence of surrealism. I just had a real difficulty to like Ir\u00e8ne Jacob's character (Valentine): she's so naive and full of guilt, it's annoying, please shake her a bit! Which reminds me that I deny that any woman can be as Dominique (played by Julie Delpy) in White. Seriously, yes some divorces can be ugly, but it's rarely that intensely ugly. But I guess it's part of the surrealism of White. I think in fact which annoys me more in White is not in White but in Red. When you end up seeing the link between the three movies, you discover that Karol (the ex-impotent ex-husband of White) is finally back with her, and I find this so improbable: first she was in prison, and unless he reported himself as having faked his own death (in which case he would be now the one in prison, not on this boat), I can't see how she would have been released; second, even if she had been released otherwise, how could she be willing to go back to him after he planned a so big revenge? And more globally, what is this stupid link between the three films? The three couples (or will-be couples) happened to take the same boat, and worse, to be the only survivors of this boat's sinking. This is so happy-ended and unnecessary: I don't think the three stories needed to be linked more than by a random and meaningless meeting (when Julie in Blue steps into the courtroom where Karol and Dominique are divorcing for example, it's enough). Which by the way leads their meeting's number to twice: what is the probability of that, people not knowing each other encountering, and then when not living in the same country anymore, meeting again on the way to a third country? And plus what is the probability that they survive all together? In fact I was expecting them to die when they started speaking about the sinking on TV: I guess the probability that they die all together is not better, so maybe Kieslowski should have given up on linking them at the end. Because the link is already elsewhere: loneliness and death are all along the three movies. People die, people survive, people fake their death, people stop loving after the death of a loved one... People are in love but lonely: Julie is in love with a dead husband, Karol is in love with his ex-wife, Valentine is in love with a jealous long-distance boyfriend. People are together but lonely, more or less haunted by death. This is how I see the big theme. I can't see the meant-to-be \"Freedom, Equality, Fraternity\". OK, not really fair in fact: I can see some freedom in Blue, in how Julie chooses to deal her own way with her grief; I can see some fraternity in Red, in how Valentine and the old judge learn from each other; but I can't see any equality, neither in White, nor in the others (because I guess this three themes are not that simply distributed between the three movies). Anyway, I am sure this trilogy is far richer than this and that anybody would find something different in it.",

            "content": "Is escaping from suffering and grief the only way to return to the person you really are? Is the solution to destroy the remaining memories or become someone else? \"Three Colors: Blue\" discusses the battle with the deep sorrow of a woman who lost her husband and her only child in a traffic accident. The main idea is understood as follows; \"We can overcome our sorrows but not by escaping\".\nThe story begins with Julie losing her husband ,who was a famous composer, and her 5 years old daughter in a car accident. The accident is implied by the liquid dripping from the car, which appears in the first minute. During the accident, the camera pointed at the hitchhiker boy and we understood the accident from the sound that we heard. In the film, the sound often comes before the image. The use of sounds is so descriptive that we don't really need to see the image. When Julie opens her eyes at the hospital, we see the image as blurry and we immediately understand that we see through the character's point of view. We watch the majority of the film with the camera that follows Julie from behind. The director depicts the psychological situation of Julie in the scene with events such as the reflection of the spoon and the impact of the piano cover. The film focuses on one character and is wanted from us to look at the story through Julie's psychology. Julie's relationship with her mother, Olivier and neighbors supports the main idea and it reaches out to one conclusion; \"Julie's search for a life without grief and sorrow\". Julie was a woman with a successful and full life before. After that devastating event, she is looking for a new beginning and decides not to do anything to turn into a different person without any material concerns. She tried to disconnect Olivier. She didn't get the signature for the expulsion of the neighbor's apartment. She didn't give the signature for the expulsion of the neighbor from her apartment. Julie's \"How can we break free from our Commitment\" thoughts slowly deteriorates in her new life with the inability to forget her sorrows and pains. The blue color, which also gave the film its name, was used as a reminder of Julie's bitter memories in her past. Blue candy wrapper that her daughter threw out the car, a completely blue child's room, a blue ornament, blue reflections, a blue light pool illuminating the darkness of the night. Although she tore off the crystals of the lamp, which is the only item left in her daughter's room, then it can be seen that he always carries them and cannot throw them away. When she took the ornament and hung it to her new home, she couldn't touch them, and when her neighbor touched the ornament, it seems she got very uncomfortable with the background of non-diegetic music. The use of music in the film has great importance to explaining the situation of the character. The music, which is the harbinger of sadness and catastrophic beginning in the first minutes of the film, leaves its place for long periods of silence after the car accident. The scenes that we can hear the music playing in the mind of Julie while she following the notes of songs composed by her wife with her finger, are great examples of diegetic use of music. When the compositions that Julie throws it away are crushed, the music we hear from papers had also crushed, torn and destroyed, almost physically. The scene that Julie wakes up at night and witnesses the fight on the street is an example of the effective use of the sound. The man who gets beaten is running away and enters Julie's apartment. Although the camera is focused on Julie, we heard the man walk up the stairs, knocked on the door of the Julie and asked for help before he found by chasers, is the sequence that we understood from the sound that we heard. Impressive concertos often heard in the film, were high or low volume according to the intensity of emotion, also the use of blue colors were the dark or light color. Sometimes the screen gets full dark for a moment when experiencing excessive emotion intensity. This is a depiction of suicidal thoughts, crushing under heavy emotions, the inability to breathe, and perhaps the desire to die. We saw in the first scenes that our character tried to commit suicide and then gave up. The temporal order of the film was given in the plot very effectively. Olivier says he's been calling Julie for a month, and we get the elapsed time. Julie learns her wife's been cheating on her, and we're learning elased time from the woman's pregnancy. Julie is hearing a flute tune and let herself into music as she sits in a cafe, we can get the time that passes from the change in the shadow of the coffee cup. Cup is recorded with close-up technique as a non-diegetic element. With the small details hidden in the plot, it has been successfully accomplished. Julie plots refusal to cry from the beginning of the film, and tears shed when she overcomes it by the end of the day, a plot that sums up the whole story itself.\n\"Three Colors: Blue\" is a film that seeks answers to these questions. It is one of the few that use the artistic aspect of cinema in such an effective, striking and understandable way at the same time. The perfect harmony of colors, sounds, camera angles and techniques in the film fits each others like a puzzle is appreciated. It is a film that keeps all kinds of emotions from beginning to the end.",

Liberty is just a ideal that is impossible to achieve, but we try to reach it for the better of ourselves. Kieslowski did an amazing job on this film, creating the most stunning images. This film should be viewed on a quality sound system, turned all the way up so one can grasp how the music is a whole different story itself.

It is true they are distinct stories with distinct themes: liberty, equality, fraternity, and each them is developed with unique applications of intrigue and artistry.  They are each well worth seeing independently, but I believe they are best seen as one work.  Collectively, I would rate the trilogy as a 9; separately, I place each in my top ten for the years 1993 and 1994.Blue is the mood of a grieving woman who lost her husband and daughter in a rural car crash; it is the shadows playing on her face in a cold hospital room as she watches television coverage of the funeral; it is light shining into an empty room of her house.  Blue is the color of her dreams and memories, which she tries to erase after the tragedy, and of the liberty she seeks after the disappointing turn in her life.  Liberty is the ultimate theme here, corresponding to the three worded French motto, `Liberty, Equality, Fraternity.'  Of the three Color films, Blue is the most stunningly photographed and conceptualized.  The plot is almost secondary and the dialogue is sparse, which gives all the more emphasis on the visual and on the thematic.  With excellent acting by Juliette Binoche, this movie rates a 9.",

Yes, yes, yes and yes.I was very engaged throughout, but writing this two days later I can't help but feel a bit unfulfilled about it all.I'm going to sound really up my own backside here but I think Martin Amis said something about stories having to be secondary to style now. His point, if I remember rightly (and maybe you shouldn't trust me on this) is that we've heard most stories before, so all we can do now is just try to tell them in ever more interesting ways. I think that's what he said, but try as I might to be an intellectual the brain isn't up to it frankly.This film has little in terms of twists and turns and plot points. But the simple tale is shown to you in such a way as to please you immensely. There are moments of two people talking that are lit so beautifully you want to grab other directors and say \"why can't you make people look as absorbing as that? You haven't been *trying* have you? Stay behind after class.\" On the other side of the equation the DVD extras have a bit of the director telling you what he was trying to achieve with the close-up shots he was using and Binoche goes on about her painful dedication to her art and you sort of want to say \"yeah, OK, chill out\" and you feel like after they gave the interviews they might giggle behind our backs and laugh at how they made us all think it was all dreadfully clever.So, I would rate it above average, but I'm suspicious of it all and I'm not convinced this film is going to stay with me for long.

His three colors trilogy came at a point in his career when he was absolutely at the height of his powers. He had just made Dekalog and The Double Life of Veronique before and the three colors trilogy would be his last great works. The trilogy begins with blue, a story of a women who suffers a great tragedy and her grieving process. The film begins with an accident ,in which her famous composer husband and young daughter are killed in a car crash ,that she survives. The way in which she deals with her grief is unexpected and very sad. At first she thinks about taking her own life but can't go through with it, then she decides to try to erase all things and people that remind her of them. She attempts to liberate herself from her past but this turns out to be difficult, the unfinished song of her husband is always playing in her head, haunting her. She is also meets with a boy who witnessed the crash, meets a mistress of her husband and has a relationship with her husbands best friend. This is the type of film that takes you inside the mind of a character. She attempts to shut out the world and just exist but as she heals and realizes how important connections with people are, she grows and the ending is beautiful and hopeful. The movie is beautiful image after beautiful image and Juliette binoche's performance is one of the best I've ever seen, she's so understated, she says a lot with her face without speaking a word. Binoche somehow is able to convey several emotions with one look, she's really incredible. The movie is covered in the color blue, as you expect, the cinematography is beautiful as in all of Kieslowski's work, each film in the trilogy is shot by a different cinematographer and has a different look like the dekalog. What impresses me most about about Kieslowski's work is the way his story's unfold so unpredictable and also his camera placement,Their is so many impressive shots in this movie. Few directors instantly involve you in a story like Kieslowski, he drops you right in and where he takes you is always interesting, complex ,unexpected, and very rewatch able. You could watch blue again and again and pick up on new things each time. Blue is a excellent film and I highly recommend it and really all of Kieslowski's work is great, he was truly a great artist.",

The movie starts with this little girl, focusing on her & her point of view, she gets in & out of a car, she sees the world as she rides in the car. As a side note, the audio wasn't working the 1st day, so the bass was very heavy. I think watching the movie this way, or at least the very beginning, helps to enhance to feeling the director chose to create of being underwater. Moving on. The camera focuses on a teenage boy sitting by the side of the road, & he watches the car drive by. He looks away. Off camera, we hear a crash. It was the car. Somehow, by not showing the actual crash, then showing the devastated car, the feeling the audience is able to experience is parrallel to that of any bystander: you hear a noise, expect it to be something mundane, and are filled with shock to realize that it is not. The rest of the movie focuses on the girl's mother, crushed to find that her husband & daughter died in the crash. At first she is self destructive, attempting suicide, having a loveless affair with an old friend, and dragging her knuckles along a stone wall until they tear & bleed. Later, she moves into an apartment, befriends her prostitute neighbor, and goes swimming. Her life is more in her control. Sadly, she finds that her husband had an affair, and the woman is now pregnant. She decided to give her husband's son their old house, and the movie ends with a sequence of everyone, showing how unhappy their lives are.

            "content": "I don't think I can emphasise how much I adore world cinema, an innocent pleasure vindicated by the 1993 French film Three Colours: Blue. Starring Juliette Binoche, the film treats us to a dreamy snapshot into human remembrance and existence, forcing us to meditate on our own experiences of life. The intelligence and reverie that Three Colours: Blue exhibits should convince anyone how world cinema, dare I say it, is superior to most of the films produced by Hollywood these days.Although I hate the fact that years of English and Drama studies have hardwired my brain to view everything as symbolically as possible, I will admit that the emblems and symbols presented in the film are simply astounding. What is particularly enticing is director Krzysztof Kie\u015blowski's ability to utilise symbols in not only objects and locations, but in film techniques as well. The smooth tripod movements and natural lighting emphasise our stability as observers of Julie's story. I don't intend to bore you with the multitude of symbols in this film, but I will mention perhaps one of the most memorable scenes in the film. As Julie swims through the ghostly blue waters of the pool, her introspection brings her to one of the core messages of the film - no matter how hard we try to suppress bad memories, we are inevitably confronted and challenged by our past.Now, allow me to examine the story without a gratuitous analysis of symbolism that could make me sound all too posh. I think the film has a strong opening that is laden with mystery and coldness that conveys how we are both observers and participants of the narrative. Julie's journey throughout Paris brought me back a feast of memories, ranging from the solitude within caf\u00e9s, to inhaling the sights and sounds of Parisan streets, and ascending through the labyrinthine staircases of apartments. I should also mention that the relationship between the story and soundtrack cleverly represents the various psychological states of Julie, with the lonely piano phrases emphasising her isolation, while the pan-flute of the busker symbolises the mystery surrounding life. Although I applaud the filmmakers' exploration of issues such as solitude and suicide, the biggest let-down for me was the fact that the film had a slow pace despite its 94 minute runtime. However, if you consider yourself to be a patient movie goer, this shouldn't be an issue for you. Despite this small crack in the armour, I was impressed with the cerebral, poetic and misty experience of watching Three Colours: Blue, and I found it to be a good film to end the week with.",

It reminded me of two films, Cronos, the debut feature from Guillermo Del Toro, and Amelie, the classic from Jean Pierre Jeunet. Blue and Cronos both have a very small scale, low budget, independent feeling about them, focused on one character's journey in a couple of different locations. It seemed like the opposite of Amelie in that they are about women in isolation, but in Blue the isolation is self imposed.\nAnd that is the most interesting aspect of the film to me, this idea of running from your grief and locking yourself up as to avoid it. Juliette Binoche's performance is brilliant and captivating, completely cold, telling that where there once was feeling is now numb.\nThe interesting use of editing of fading to black at dramatic high points and kicking in the orchestral music was just that, \"interesting\". I'll know on a rewatch whether it works fully for me or not, but I appreciate it had a purpose, although partially distracting.\nThe naming and colouring of Blue, White, Red could become pretentious but in this film it was not subtle at all, although less distracting after a while. The film gets away with the colour because it really is entirely written around it, capturing the emotions of what blue can represent, beautiful but cold, enticing but distant. The theme of liberty seemed to me to be chastised by Krzysztof, this concept of it being not only a torturous existence to truly imbrace isolation, but also impossible in the world we live in.",

            "content": "This film has been a constant source of inspiration for me since seeing it five years ago.  Juliette Binoche turns in an amazing performance as Julie, a woman who loses her husband and young girl in an auto accident that she survives. Numbed, Julie reacts by giving up her material possessions and turning her back on humanity.  After starting life anew, however, she is forced to come to terms with and help the eccentric characters she meets (including the sex-show worker who is despised in Julie's building and the lawyer carrying her deceased husband's child).These characters force Julie to feel emotion and ambition again. Watching Julie finish the grand musical composition that her husband began is to see a triumph of the human spirit.  Despite the tragedy that made her want to ultimately withdraw from life, she brilliantly perseveres in the end. \"Bleu\" is a truly inspirational story.I highly recommend watching Binoche in \"The English Patient\" and \"Damage\", two films which further show-case her talent and beauty.",

The score is an integral part of the story, or better, the essence of this film, and it is, in one word, horrible. I'm very sorry. This is very bad music. Like Mozart, as one reviewer thought? No way, Mozart is always light, and when he isn't, like in the requiem, he is profound. The score is neither. It's pretty personal, I know. But imagine what an Alban Berg-like score would bring to this movie. Or any twentieth-century informed music for that matter. Here we are stuck with music as boring as a Gorecki-symphony, endearing for a minute or two, but containing absolutely nothing.",

We are reminded that one day we were defenceless babies, too.

The protagonist Julie (Juliette Binoche) has just lost her family (husband and daughter) in a car accident. She is disheartened and despondent as she attempts to recreate her life. The encounter with the mouse family represents the newfound feeling of sympathy. She is unable to kill the mice because such barbarous act would represent the perpetuation of her own family disintegration.Finally, Julie borrows the neighbour's cat in order to carry out the murderous task.

            "review_title": "Beautiful visuals and a stunning score are even better when combined",
            "content": "For me, this movie has a very simple emotional conceit. The picture starts with a car crash, and we immediately learn that Julie has lost her daughter and husband. She attempts suicide, but can't bring herself to go through with it and instead decides to \"liberate\" herself from her grief in a different way: detachment. The conceit? Will Julie be able to maintain the detachment, or will she be cajoled (in a way) back into acknowledging the past?Of course, this is not the most revolutionary movie conceit, but I found it powerfully displayed and compellingly discussed. As the picture went on, I found myself increasingly wanting Julie to reject that false \"liberty\" and instead return to emotional connection. I certainly understand different perspectives and tastes, and I certainly agree the movie is very slow-paced, but I think to write off this conflict as \"boring\" or \"pretension\" is a bit unfair. I was unusually invested in this conflict, much more than in other pictures I've seen recently.But that does not make it a 10/10 movie for me. What does? Well, I think that the advantage movies have over books and art and music is the way they can combine visuals and sound into one single overwhelming experience. Kieslowski's choice is rather simple: the color blue, the fade cuts, the Preisner score... all of these form the \"test\" -- Julie's past slowly seeping into her present. This is the unique part of this movie. We're not told directly that her past is coming back by dialogue, but by the otherworldly forces only movies are capable of. \"Blue\" and its associated music becomes a character. Of course Kieslowski hits the viewer over the head with it, because this is not meant to be a secret. It seems to me that \"Blue\" is supposed to be that lifeboat calling for Julie to forsake her detachment and return to the emotional world.And given how cleverly Preisner manipulates motifs to tell this story in a heightened way, I think it's unreasonable (almost ludicrous) to declare such music \"bad\". I'd argue this is one of the best scores (even if entirely divorced from the visuals) of the past fifty years. And when combined? There are a number of scenes where I was absolutely immersed: the moment the music first enters when the reporter starts asking questions, the way the music contorts when thrown in the trash compactor, the collaborative music session where the screen blurs...As for the visuals? I won't even get into all of the magnificent shots Idziak is responsible for, as this review would become unreasonably long. Besides, the consensus from just about every review I've ever read on this seems to be the picture is beautifully shot.All of it sets the stage for an ending montage which absolutely levelled me. All of the different threads for a moment are brought together, the wonderful Preisner score combined in full for the first time, singing out some truly wonderful lyrics from Corinthians 13. And, after all this time, as her original contribution to the score starts to play, we see Julie cry, embrace the emotional grief she has been avoiding all this time. And then, in a truly inspired touch, as the hint of a smile starts to spread across Binoche's face in recognition that emotional connection is worth that hurdle...The screen cuts to overwhelming blue and the Van den Budemayr motif screams out in full. Julie's finale she appends to her husband's music says that the sorrowful past must be embraced. But by accepting that terrifying sadness, Julie can move forwards again. The decision to combine the narrative and musical depictions of the same idea is really quite a lovely one, and by the end it leaves me speechless with its breathtaking power.Yes, the narrative is rather simple, as is the theme. But honestly, I'll sacrifice intricate plotting and philosophical essays for a beautifully shot, stunningly scored, cleverly conceived picture every day of the week.",

I think its intention is to show how much music is inside the character of Juliette Binoche. Due to her mourning she is trying to suppress this music but it still finds its way to the surface.The movie contains some very impressive closeups, i.e. a feather on a blanket, a reflecting eye shot, a piece of sugar which is soaked up with coffee, etc . I think it underlines the inner conflicts and sadness of the protagonist, who is trying to shield herself from what is going on around her.The color blue is nicely present everywhere. In particular I enjoyed the exquisite scenes in the swimming pool.I was disappointed by a subplot with a young woman who is a neighbor and works in the red light district.

The music sets the perfect mood, and is so brilliant that points to the real meaning : freedom does not come by denying your surroundings and living anonymously. Freedom is achieved through doing what you feel like, through not turning your back on your nature. A free person is the person that does everything he likes doing.

            "content": "\"Blue\" was incredible.  Like Kubrick, Krzysztof Kieslowski uses symbolic images -- in the case of this \"trilogy\" it is very often colors as the titles would suggest.  Where Kubrick makes serious commentary about society and the civilized world, Kieslowski paints a picture of emotion and the human psyche -- many would argue a more daunting task.Truly the interpretation of this film is personal to the individual who watched it, but here's my take.  \"Blue\" was about one emotion, one state of mind:  the numbness we experience before grieving.  It is something that every human being who has suffered goes through, whether it is for just a few minutes or for a lifetime, as we feared Binoche's character would do. I felt the plot was a vehicle by which the director painted these emotions so vividly.Binoche's character suffered intensely and seemed numb to the world around her, but at the same time she also became more empathic and sensitive. She could not stand the thought of others having to suffer -- which was the case in her interaction with the prostitute-dancer and with the mice in her closet.  These many paradoxes in the human mind seem to be a running theme in this film (another is the closeness and anger she felt for the lawyer who carried her dead husband's child), and possibly his others (of which I have yet to see).To anyone who has a weak stomach for wrenching emotional imagery, stay away from this film.  However, if you want to see an artistic and poetic triumph in a film, you must see \"blue.\"",

Juliette Binoche is truly magnificent, and her acting is way more subtle and deep than in any of the tacky US market oriented movies she did afterwards (like the overestimated english patient). Every silence, sigh, and smile is right. US audiences may think it is all somewhat slow, but the more sophisticated European public adores this kind of acting, where there actually is some thinking and interpreting required.",

            "review_title": "Deeply moving & profound",
            "content": "In the film, the powerful first part of a trilogy, the incredible strength and fortitude of a woman is shown in a profoundly moving way. Julie is already a deep character, but after the horrific accident where her husband and son were killed, we can see Julie pull herself together and gradually, through slowness and change, and realizing who her real friends are, find meaning in life again. The motifs of music and color throughout the film add so much to it, as the music is closely tied to the story line and the coloring and lighting of the film creates a specific mood for each scene that reflects Julie's own psyche and further allows viewers to enter into her perspective. Julie's late husband was a composer, and so the music in the film reflects his music and helps narrate the storyline and leads up to the moment when Julie makes the decision to team up with Olivier, her husband's friend, and complete her husband's unfinished piece.\nThe motif of color and lighting is significant, as it is a little unusual in revealing the car accident at the beginning. The lighting has a soft tone, with blues and greys and fog, rather than the usual harsh colors in car accident scenes. The crash is viewed from a distance, from the eyes of a random passer-by boy. This detail of softness, with the muted, misty colors, almost muffles the impact of such a tragedy which dictates the rest of the film. In other parts of the film, other colors signify more than just the typical setting. For example, the deep blue of the pool where Julie begins consistently swimming to ponder her husband's music, signifies both mourning, but also healing, with the richness of the blue mixed with the water. In the club where Lucille works, the bright reds and pinks exude sensuality, but the blurry focus in that scene brings the focus instead to what Julie discovers there when glancing at the TV in the office. The greens and browns of the apartment could be interpreted as the apartment being a place of growth, where Julie lives and begins to find herself again. Julie moves from a \"blue\" world (a world of grief, mourning, and numbness) to a living world full of vivacity, color, and music shared with the world and not just internalized. Furthermore, people begin to gather around her, people like Lucille and Olivier, who truly come to care about her. This human connection is essential, a stark difference from the first part of the film, where she is always alone, trying to live from day to day without support or connection from anyone.\nThe characters are important for Julie's transformation, too. Lucille's role in Julie's life represents an introduction to joy and liveliness. When Julie refuses to sign a petition to get Lucille evicted from the apartment building for being promiscuous, Lucille is eternally grateful for Julie's kindness, even though it was just an act of neutrality. Lucille's frank, outgoing, and mischievous nature helps draw out Julie, and when Lucille needs her help, Julie finds herself going far out of her comfort zone (to an adult club on the other side of town in the middle of the night), but this scene is a turning point for Julie. Being helped and being able to help another person begins to transform Julie from a complete recluse into half of a valuable female friendship. Furthermore, in this scene, she sees on the TV that Olivier has the manuscript for Julie's husband's unfinished piece, and it awakens another emotion in her, anger, that fuels her from a sedentary state into action. Olivier's somewhat presumptuous move here, in appropriating the manuscript, proves, like Lucille's character, that living quietly and without ant courage is unfulfilling, while taking some risks for a good purpose brings excitement and joy into one's life. Julie discovers this as she finally takes the step to help Olivier finish the manuscript.\nI wasn't sure about the role of the mother in the story - it seemed like she was just there to show that Julie literally had no one to connect to, since her mother was senile and was unable to support her tragically widowed daughter. At the end of the film, however, the scene where the characters are listening to the finished piece, it shows the mother hearing it.\nI did like the added plotline with the husband's mistress. It helped define a way for Julie to let go of the past a little more, although I do feel like in real life that interaction might have been a little more nuanced. The scene in the women's restroom where Julie confronts her is excellently done. As a viewer, you have no idea what Julie is going to do, and you can see on the face of the mistress that she recognizes Julie before she lets on. Julie's calm demeanor gives her more power here than the situation should, and that power carries her further into a sense of herself as an individual, which she needs to carry on living after such a loss.\nOverall, the film was hauntingly beautiful, packed with meaning, and so thought provoking that one finds oneself mulling it over days after viewing.",

The colors portray Julie's internal emotions expressed in an external way.

Although Julie's spiritual transformation is the film's central focus, that metamorphosis isn't possible without Zbigniew Preisner's score. Like the balancing act of the camera and the performers, Preisner strikes a chord (if you'll excuse the pun) that resonates softly, initially, but as it drones on begins to echo the lingering antagonisms of consciousness that haunt the protagonist after her loss. On the other hand, it is in fact the harrowing reminder that is the music that allows Julie to reach the other side, to surface amidst the beautiful elegy that is closure and, in turn, release.",

We follow Julie as she tries to navigate her new existence.The movie has an almost dreamlike quality to it at times with blue being present throughout most of the film. It's always nice to see films utilize colors in interesting ways, instead of the generic stuff in most big blockbusters. However, the use of blue is not exactly a gimmick, it never feels as if the filmmaker is trying to be profound.Blue is not a film where an awful lot of things happen. We see Julie go through her emotions in an effort to live on with the immense burden of sorrow that rests in almost every frame of the film. Julie is a stern and strong-willed character. At first, she comes off as almost too stoic and indifferent to everything; this is partly justified due to her having just lost her family. Yet throughout the film, we see her make connections with other people. She forges friendships and bonds with strangers and helps them along their journey. A very interesting juxtaposition is thus created between the way Julie represents herself and the way she acts.The film is full of moments that will stay in your mind long after the film is over. The film takes its time and lets these moments sit, this creates a slow pacing that fits and further enhances the film. The slow pace is never a problem since the film is only 90 minutes long. The cinematography and direction are both top notch like when Julie is told of the ascendant at the hospital, the doctor is reflected in her eye and we do not see her. Juliette Binoche delivered a performance for the history books with a powerful yet underplayed performance.Regimented to people who like:\nForening films\nA slow moving Character-study.",

I suppose its a somewhat arty film in a respect but I certainly didn't feel like it was being, or attempting to be, pretentious.\n\nIn the film, there's mention of 'The unification of Europe' which seems more than a little ironic these days given the dreaded B word in British politics (Brexit) but hey-ho.

It is heavily symbolic, with its intricate use of music, the dominant use of the colour blue in the colour palette, its interesting use of fade outs (though actually different to their usual use, representative of time standing still rather than it passing or a scene conclusion), links to the main character's past (here the use of falling) and the bottle recycling, but not in an incoherent sense.\n\nVisually, 'Three Colours: Blue' looks stunning. The whole film is shot with aesthetic grace and elegance and while the use of blue is dominant for symbolic reasons it is never gimmicky or cheap. Kieslowski's direction is thoughtful and never intrusive, and the intricate music score and the symbolic way it's utilised (representing Julie's struggles with isolation) is inspired, \"Song for the Unification of Europe\" is one of the most emotional tracks of music in any film seen by me recently.\n\nStory-wise, 'Three Colours: Blue' challenges in a way but also always engages, mainly because of how movingly and intensely it deals with the tragic story of Julie and its themes of grief and liberty. The pacing is deliberate but never hits a dull spot.\n\nOne of 'Three Colours: Blue' is the astonishing performance from Juliette Binoche, an intensely affecting portrayal that ranks high up with her best performances. All the cast are fine, particularly Beno\u00eet R\u00e9gent and Emmanuelle Riva, but in the acting stakes this is Binoche's film.\n\nAll in all, a beautiful, thought-provoking and moving film, and a wonderful start for a very interesting trilogy of films. 10/10 Bethany Cox",

It almost seems as if I'm grieving with our character Julie. Three Colors: Blue is easily a perfect film, filled with so much beauty in so much pain. Obviously, such as the title states, Kieslowski utilizes and plays with color as his main format. We humans have all felt \"blue.\" Being one those people who look at the intricate details, I noticed and loved where the color blue appears in the tiniest of places. A blue trash bag in between two white ones when Julie throws her husband's sheet music in the garbage truck. Olivier's blue folder that makes an appearance in his hands in more the beginning of the film. Even in the dimmest of lighting, the color's presence is made known. Blue is everywhere because sadness follows us everywhere. Sadness is sadly a part of life.\n\nThose two quotes written in the beginning of this review has significant impact, at least in my perspective. When we go into the stages of grief after tragedy, life stops and we cannot fathom recovery. We start to view life differently and distance ourselves from everyone and everything. We no longer want to experience the good things in life because we see the glass half empty; time is borrowed and nothing is forever, making it better to not get attached and care at all. Yet, we may not see it now, but we will overcome these extremely hard times, especially when we least expect it. We soon come back to ourselves, our want to live, our want to experience all of life's gifts, and our want to love.",

Neither of them makes a logical sense. Logic aside, however, neither can spare us such an inexorable phase or get us out of it miraculously. Julie seems to have veered into the latter route in order to evade slipping down the abyss of the former. But grief must take its natural course, and suppressing it would result in truly dire circumstances at their worst scenario would be being imprisoned by depression, shrouding us metaphorically until a shroud takes its place quite literally.\n\n\"Now I have only one thing left to do: nothing. I don't want any belongings, any memories. No friends, no love. Those are all traps.\"\n\nKie\u015blowski incessantly tries to save her from such fate and draw her back to life once again. His camera lingers in extreme close-ups on Juliette Binoche's features to draw out of them a smidgen of the sadness Julie does her utmost to bury inside herself. Later on as Julie keeps pushing grief away in her quest of severing herself from the past, she finds herself drawn back to it as memories surround her everywhere and no matter how hard she tries to escape them. When she returns back to her home for the first time after the accident that cost the lives of her husband (a renowned music composer) and her daughter, she asks the gardener if he has emptied the \"blue\" bedroom, which implies her trying of getting rid of the past. She goes upstairs only to find a \"blue\"-beaded chandelier, that's likely belonged to her daughter, hanging over her, just like her memories of her daughter. Julie's journey of liberating herself, in one sense, from her past life becomes impeded with reminders of her two dears she lost. Furthermore, Julie's incomplete grief begets anger and irritability that put her mental state at stake. And as memories relentlessly haunt her, she ends up surrendering to them, literally having her head under (blue)water. However, blue gradually begins to mutate its symbolic significance as liberation takes on a totally different definition in Julie's mind. It's here where Zbigniew Preisner's score blossoms into a salvaging tool. There's one scene, in particular, that I found fascinating where Julie and her husband's colleague trying to complete her husband's unfinished manuscript. The shot is pulled out of focus until it becomes almost utterly blurred, forcing the viewer to hear the music playing inside of their heads as they orchestrate parts of it. It's still a liberation of the past, but one of letting go of it while maintaining, nay cherishing its memories instead of eliminating them. A liberation that thrives on a catharsis for all of Julie's repressed painful feelings, bringing forth her deepest sobs and setting her free.",

People cope with events like this in different ways, and this movie never really feels like a movie. It is a very artsy movie that uses the actual color of blue to set the right tone and also for some visually impressive moments. Sometimes the movie isn't the most eventful, but it works since it is a slice-of-life movie. Overall, it is an artistic and honest look at grief and loss, and I think people who appreciate the film on a technical level will find plenty to appreciate in it.",

While part of a trilogy designed to explore the French identity, Blue can't help but lean overwhelmingly into its individual narrative, so overwhelming is the sense of controlling grief and loss that Binoche's Julie feels throughout essentially the entire runtime; it may not be until after the credits roll that you remember to search for political subtext. Cleverly shot with an overtly defined focus on visual elements to support (many would say supplant) its narrative, Kie\u015blowski clearly had a vision in designing the shot along with cinematographer Idziak, and creates a protagonist in Julie that goes far beyond a pandering, simplistic 'sadness' to instead feel complex, real, often devastating. Her journey is at first despondent, then tentatively hopeful, and finally somewhat redemptive, but never is there a Hollywood moment of complete healing that would have ruined the sincerity of her labor. If you're feeling a bit down, I wouldn't reccomend watching it, because Blue is not going to help with a short-term solution. (4.5/5)",

In Blue I felt like I was Julie, I felt like I was seeing what Julie was seeing, I felt like I was listing to what Julie was listing, and that's the beauty of the film. \n\nI loved how the movie's name is Blue and you will notice that in nearly every single scene / shot the color blue or at least a certain shade of the color Blue is there even if it's a small thing like a sign in a street or a shirt that a character is wearing, blue is just always there and you will know why the color Blue has a big effect on Julie and it takes on deferent meanings to match Julie's emotions. The Cinematography & colors were just so beautiful and pure.\n\nThe Production design was so amazing, the beautiful streets of France, the swimming pool, and Julie's apartment, it just gives you that weird grief feeling that Julie is feeling inside of her. \n\nThe incredible score (the symphony) that was so weird, full of emotions and starts to play suddenly, I loved how in some scenes pieces of the symphony suddenly play over the soundtrack at emotional moments and how Julie seems to hear it as if it's surging up from inside her own mind, also the scene when she throws the sheet music into the garbage truck if you listen closely, the song distorts as the trash compactor's teeth tear the paper. we are hearing everything exactly the way that Julie is hearing. \n\nJuliette Binoche's performance was so crazy, she didn't have many lines in the film and she rarely speaks but, she was able to give us such a deep performance as her character navigates grief, in one of the scenes that I can't mention or I'll spoil the movie,  Juliette Binoche was able to play Julie's hurt and anger, but also her curiosity and maybe even envy all at once. She was just incredible and was able to act with her facial expressions more than with her speaking or saying some words. \n\nAn amazing movie that I really enjoyed and highly recommend it.\n\nMy rating is: 9/10\n\n(credits go to \"CrashCourse\" from youtube for their video: \"Three Colors - Blue: Crash Course Film Criticism #11\")",

            "content": "When I set out to watch Krzysztof Kieslowski's Three Colors trilogy I expected to be most impressed by this film because it starred the incredible Juliette Binoche and sounded the most \u00e2~serious' and weighty. After watching all three films I would actually say this was the weakest of the three because it is largely devoid of the humor so present in the other films and the grief just feels monotonous after a while. I suppose that was part of the point, grief is monotonous and inescapable, however I expected a filmmaker like Kieslowski to bring something more to the film, to make it more engaging. This is definitely a film that you should watch I just didn't find as much to love about it as I did with Three Colors: White (1994) or Three Colors: Red (1994).\n\nJulie, Juliette Binoche, loses her philandering composer husband and beloved daughter in a tragic car accident. She grieves and suffers in the aftermath as she is pursued by a young man who witnessed the crash and impulsively has sex with Olivier, Benoit Regent, who was one of her husband's friends. As her life continues to crumble around her she attempts self harm as a way to release emotion. One of her husband's, or possibly her own, uncompleted compositions haunts her and when she is finally able to complete it, we see her dragging her finger over the written scroll as a recurring motif, she can finally emotionally mourn her loved ones.\n\nThis is a film that I didn't really get, the only person that I have really mourned in my life is my grandfather and I was not particularly close to him. The whole thing felt like an exercise in misery punctuated by odd moments of sections of classical music playing while the camera cuts to black and then fades back in on the exact same shot. I wasn't exasperated or angered by my inability to understand the film or really connect it I want to watch the film again someday when I have more life experience.\n\nI understand that my lack of comprehension of the film sort of invalidate me in my attempt to evaluate it but I still found elements of the film to appreciate and would urge those who have experienced grief to watch it.\n\nThe performance of Binoche was, as I expected, very good as her dark eyes convey an emptiness and a wounded sensibility that stands out amongst the relatively nonplussed figures around her. When she scratches her knuckles against a rock wall Binoche is provided with a moment to engage in Capital A Actress-ing and she takes it but it's not as frustrating as Nicole Kidman in The Hours (2002) or Felicity Jones in The Theory of Everything (2014). Her commiseration with her husband's pregnant mistress is a moment where Binoche shines as she quietly suffers at the thought of her husband's affair and seemingly genuine love for another woman. Obviously this film was probably a bit too arty for it to be acknowledged in the acting categories at the Academy Awards but when considering that Jessica Lange, ugh, won for Blue Sky (1994) I think that Binoche was absolutely robbed.\n\nThe visuals of the film were the other aspect that I was able to appreciate with blue being the dominant color, of course, but the starkness of Bincohe's slim, dark figure against the Parisian dusk is a memorable image. The blue beads that she holds tightly in her hands probably represent something deeper but for me they were the best use of the color blue in the film as although this is an \u00e2~obvious' analysis, I see the blue as a metaphor for her grief and it's presence everywhere constantly reminds her of her loss. The film looks gorgeous and sophisticated in that wonderful European way and although it's a shallow reason to enjoy the film I drew some pleasure out of Kieslowski's attention towards this.\n\nAs I said before I think that this will be a far more rewarding experience as a film when I am older because it is a study of a woman who has experienced many things in her life and struggles to let them go. I have not felt these things so I had only a surface level understanding of her pain but I could see that the film was working on an altogether different level that dilettantes like myself would fail to understand.",

It starts with a high drama moment, but the rest of the film doesn\u2019t have that same energy. In fact, because of the actions of the main character (played brilliantly by Juliette Binoche) it is the exact opposite. The whole thrust of her journey in the film seems to be releasing life of attachments, so that there is no more risk of loss. It\u2019s heart-wrenching at times, because we know what has prompted this, and we want to see her overcome the tragedy. But eventually the slow pacing of the movie and the emotionless tone started to wear me down, and I was getting bored. I was still invested in the character, and wanted to see how she would move on after the trials she\u2019d been through, but I got impatient with the film, because it took so long to get there. I did enjoy the way that the music was utilized as a symbol that she couldn\u2019t escape her past life, but I was hoping to hear the entire piece at the end as some type of payoff for her journey. Three Colors: Blue is a beautiful film, and it has something to say, but I\u2019m not sure I\u2019d want to watch it again isolated from the other films in the trilogy.",

The aftermath of such a major upheaval, the repercussions that it costs and the emotions a person goes through, is what's this tale about. But don't jump on the conclusions yet, Kieslowski is a real trickster when it comes to storytelling. His range is so vast and detailed, that you find yourself floating in its bubble staring at the abyss beauty of it. Armed with jaw dropping score and eye popping cinematography, this is certainly a cinema at its peak. The narration follows the protagonist from the first frame till the curtain drops.\n\nThis is something that isn't often seen. And addition to that, to keep the audience still tangled in its pathos bubble and rooting for the characters is what sweetens this layered cake. The screenplay is tightly packed with gripping plot and adaptive metaphorical tone that is beautifully poetic. Even though the entire concept is dipped in brimful of poignancy, the language of the picture is utterly soothing and hopeful to the core. Kieslowski keeps giving you back at each definite interval, he genuinely cares about the quality of his story. Binoche is literally the soul survivor of the movie.\n\nShe has the potential to melt you down within the first few minutes of her screentime. And when she is offered such a three dimensional character, she soars against all the hokum of your expectations and stunningly fabricates her portrayal onto the screen, this is arguably the best work of her career. Chugging down all the viscous material and loping it up on the screenplay, Kieslowski pushes the boundaries of cinema to newer territories and builds a safe home for the script. Trois Couleurs: Bleu is fairly one color foliated into many, and it is that transition that the makers succeed at.",

Juliet Binoche underplays enigmatic widow, Julie, to perfection and the film is visually arresting throughout.\nHowever, mirrored by it's own music and subject matter, Kieslowski's film is a sort of symphonic climb towards yet-to-be-established greatness; always cold, but never chilling, and fundamentally anti-climatic. There's clunky exposition, cliche galore and controversial editing choices, and, the whole time, it's hard to shake the feeling that Kieslowski's picture isn't quite as profound as it thinks it is. Unique and intriguing, but ultimately just pretentious.",

            "content": "This film isn't exactly what I was expecting, because I was thinking that this was supposed to be about 80 minutes of a blue screen and narrations about Derek Jarman's life... in English. No, wait, this is just the other avant-garde film from 1993 that was coincidentally titled \"Blue\", or, in the case of the French... \"Bleu\". We ignorant Americans just rearranged the letters, kind of like we rearranged the pattern of colors on the French flag for our flag, as this trilogy will remind you, for whatever reason. Yeah, maybe I shouldn't have gotten this film confused with Jarman's \"Blue\", because, sadly, Jarman didn't live to be able to make another two of these blasted movies. Blue on the flag represents liberty, so maybe they should have called this film \"Liberty\", because it's hard enough to find an avant-garde film when just one of them shares a title and year with another one. Anyways, the fact of the matter is that there are two more of these films, and I keep addressing that because there's not too much more going on in this drama than there is in Jarman's \"Blue\", 80 minutes of a blue screen and narration. Man, this movie is dull, although it does have its commendable aspects, at least in concept.\r\n\r\nAn intimate portrait on a woman coping with an impossible tragedy, not through human interaction, but through isolation which doubles as a subtle social commentary, this film's story is minimalist, and its telling is so thin that it's difficult to get invested even in its potential, but the potential is there, promising intriguing dramatic and thematic value for Krzysztof Kie\u015blowski to betray and do justice as director. Kie\u015blowski meditative directorial style tends to be tedious, when it's not simply bland, as it's not justified by accessible material, although, when there is material for Kie\u015blowski to draw upon, while it's never particularly effective, there ought to be some arousal to one's emotions, intelligence and, of course, aesthetic side. Kie\u015blowski at least keeps consistent in working well with the film's style, and even then, there's only so much flare to the visual style, and only so much music at all, but when Zbigniew Preisner's genuine classical score is played up, it's powerful its own right and complimentary to the emotive aspects of this drama, and when S\u0142awomir Idziak's cinematography is really allowed to flesh out its - you guessed it - blue palette in the context of hauntingly spare lighting, a sense of near-dreamy intimacy is biting. The style is primarily effective on its own, and that's impressive enough, considering just how outstanding the film's score and cinematography get to be, but it does do a fine job of complimenting what resonance there is to this cold affair. The lovely Juliette Binoche helps, though not as much as they, as she is earning praise for a performance which has hardly any material to work with, but is still asked to project a sense of distance and gloom as a woman faced with tragedy. The leading Julie de Courcy character does nothing but mope, never even having a major emotional breakthrough, but Binoche's subtlety and grace humanizes such a thin role enough to reflect worthy inspiration in a film which generally aspires to be nothing more than tedious in its subtlety. There is enough effective dramatic and aesthetic value to save the final product, but just barely, as the film is so aggravating in its misguidance, something that a minimalist story concept cannot afford to be faced with.\r\n\r\nI've given my praise to the dramatic and thematic value of this story concept as an intimate character study and social allegory, but this narrative might be too intimate for its own good, being minimalist in scope and potential, as surely as it is lacking in originality. This story isn't especially new, or, if it is, then the uniqueness is obscured a good bit by an execution which is very formulaic, as confusing as that sounds, given the storytelling has an artistically offbeat approach to subject matter which is minimalist enough in concept. This is yet another abstractly structured French drama which is too wrapped up in its realism to pick up momentum, and although that's not where the excess ends in this focally uneven and repetitious plot, the ostensibly thematic meditations on meanderings are too monotonous to sell the allegorical which are themselves too subtle, and the dramatic elements which are themselves too thin, not unlike the characterization which is supposed to drive the dramatics. The supporting characters feel like inconsequential supplements to the story of a lead who, despite being faced with particularly rough times, is nothing extraordinary, and is hardly nuanced, being well-portrayed by Juliette Binoche, but thinly drawn by the inexplicably sizable writing team of Krzysztof Kie\u015blowski and Piesiewicz, Agnieszka Holland, and Edward \u017bebrowski. As effective as Binoche is, that is, with pathetically thin material, I never could get invested in a lead too uninteresting and problematic on paper to be sold without extensive characterization, thus, this intimate character study loses a lot of dramatic intrigue that it cannot afford to part with, no when Kie\u015blowski, as director, takes such a subdued approach. The limply meditative storytelling structure goes accompanied by a limply meditative directorial atmosphere which has its moments, but, as you can imagine, primarily has hardly any material to draw upon with thoughtfulness, resulting in dull spells which are not occasional, or even recurrent, but all but consistent throughout this occasionally effective drama, drying out the atmosphere and trying your patience with enough tedium to frustrate. At the same time, there is plenty of simple dryness to meet the tedious moments, thus, the final product is too bland to be contemptible, but, make no mistake, it isn't exactly enjoyable, having its moments, but losing a lot of resonance through abstractionism, obviously never to be redeemed through entertainment value, whose absence secures the final product as totally inconsequential.\r\n\r\nOverall, there is some potential intrigue to this story concept which is done some justice when Krzysztof Kie\u015blowski, as director, finds realization in his utilizing thoughtfulness, haunting musical and visual style, and a solid performance by Juliette Binoche to establish highlights in effectiveness which save the film from contempt, yet are seriously rare, or at least feel as though they are, for there are enough natural shortcomings to the intimate narrative, conventions to an already problematically monotonous meditative storytelling structure, thinness to the characterization, - even of an uninteresting lead - and tedium to a punishingly subdued atmosphere to make \"Three Colors: Blue\" something of a weak squandering of time, and only the beginning (Gulp... down some coffee, because there's two more to go).\r\n\r\n2/5 - Weak",

I truly admired Krzysztof Kieslowski's approach with the film as filmmakers these days seem to try their best to cater towards the audience's expectations and resolve the character's story the way that is acceptable for them, which at times hurt the film's emotional and thematic impact. The film doesn't let us get too close to our protagonist, Julie, we never at any moment get inside her head, we only have her actions and her words to shape our perspective of her and I think this approach kind of left me a tad bit detached at some moments and finding it hard to empathise, but I think the director wanted us to not let the film speak itself too frankly, he wants us to keep coming back and observing her, hoping that each visit would let us become closer to the character and develop a unique understanding of who she is, what she is feeling, and how she would get through it.\n\nThe film also explores Julie's coping mechanism of her depression and grief. Julie's way of coping is definitely not something a psychiatrist or counsellor would recommend as her remedy is to isolate herself from the objects that could bring about memories of her loved ones. Julie also engages herself in activities like swimming, which at first I thought was her way of distracting herself from the recurring thoughts of her family, as the film went on I started to see what Kieslowski was trying to create with those scenes, she is swimming in her sadness and at times drowning herself in it. This held me back in thinking she is close to moving on with her life, but since the director is going for something more realistic in dealing with depression, I was more willing to let myself accept the decisions that the characters make. Throughout the late second-third act of the film, we are treated to a side of Julie that wasn't primarily seen at the start of the film. We get to see her immerse herself in the art of music, which I found to be highly entertaining as this gives us a glimpse of what she used to be and how talented she was before the tragic event.\n\nI cannot go into high subjective detail on the film's cinematography as I feel that I need to go through this once more before I could properly criticize the choices that both the director and cinematographer have taken. All I could say for now is that the photography of the film captures that distance between us and the protagonist perfectly, no matter how close the camera is we could never fully penetrate her. There were a couple of times where I did feel the use of the color blue was a bit too emphasised in a couple of shots, but then over time I was able to get through it and appreciate it's usage, particularly the scenes that involves Julie swimming in the large pool. The film at times switches between mounted and stable shots to hand held tracking shots. The director is manipulating how much of the character we see, there are times where the film lets us in and at times we only see partially or are too far away from the character.\n\nThe film's score was a definitely one of the film's highlights as the score creates this sense of impact during particular moments in the film, accurately representing how she feels at that given moment. The film was clever enough to have the film's protagonist be aware of the music, as the music seems to play as a reminder of the event and at the same time a sense of inspiration in how his husband's magnum opus composition should turn out. Since both the protagonist and the audience can hear the music, we are able to feel a sense of empathy, which is something of a rarity throughout the film.\n\nThe film's acting was mainly anchored by Juliette Binoche and she does a wonderful job here. I have only seen the actress on Abbas Kiarostami's Certified Copy which I thought she did a great job with, but her performance in this film took my perspective of her even further. Binoche is an outstanding actress who definitely deserves more credit than she currently has as when he embodies a role, she does it with such precision that one's previous understanding of the actress would be wiped clean when starting a new film. Just on scenes where the camera captures a close up of her face, she doesn't reveal much but it definitely does not seem hollow, there is something there but one has to look harder in order to obtain it.\n\nBlue is a great film that contains a wonderful and powerful performance from Juliette Binoche and a story that avoids from being predictable. If one places an effort to understand and connect with the character, then one would be left highly rewarded by the end of the film.",

All I knew before viewing was that these series of films represented the flag of France; Blue-Red and White. For the first installment of this trilogy, it starts off starkly grim. It's the death of family which results in the loss of compassion in Julie, the main character. I found that this film borrowed many techniques from Truffaut's New Wave style. It reminded me of the 400 blows where characters just float through life as if they were a leaf in the wind. Julie and her actions really felt still and cold. It's like she doesn't live anymore. It's a fantastic display of grief and sadness but somehow it stays alive. \"Now I have only one thing left to do: nothing. I don't want any belongings, any memories. No friends, no love. Those are all traps.\" \nThere is an enormous amount of symbolism in this film. One particular recurring symbol was the pool where she always soaked in. It was a metaphor for her neutrality, her life constantly on the edge of death. Kieslowski does a fantastic job with this first installment. This film is like a breath of fresh air waiting to come out. You are waiting on the edge of your seat for that one time where Julie finally loves again. All of the elements, the symbolism come into play beautifully. It's a quiet yet extremely loud film; a foundation for Kieslowski's love for life. \n\nI loved this film and I was deeply moved. It was nice to see something so different yet so similar. It's a life that everyone can relate with as it's themes are so universal. I don't know how it relates to the french flag but in my eyes, it's a magnificent film anyway. This is true cinema.",

I hadn't seen the films previously, but starting with the first, I thought it was, indeed, a masterpiece. Not only is it one of the most beautiful films I've ever seen, but it's also one of the more affecting ones I've seen. The film is really about loss and the transition between losing a loved one and later having to let go. It's a tough process for anyone, and I think that Kieslowski captures that brief moment of insanity brilliantly. Juliette Binoche is also unforgettable and her performance is magnificent.

Julie is a grieving widow but she doesn't act according to that, she calls a man, a friend of her and her deceased husband, she suspects that he have feelings for her and finds out that she's right, she make love to him not to insult the memory of her husband but just to see if she can still enjoy it but it doesn't seem to work for her anymore.  There are a few more plot developments and surprises but that's not what makes this film as fascinating as it is. I can't think of better actress for the role of Julie than Juliette Binoche, she has one of those faces you enjoy to read, because the biggest mystery in this movie is Julie's feelings and the only clue to solve that mystery is her face.",

The peculiar thing about the film, is we only hear about what she was like before the accident, and never see it. I'm not sure if this was the proper decision by director Kieslowski, because it resulted in lack of character development and a withdrawal of emotion from that scene. At the same time it kept the films focus on its purpose. The brilliance of Blue is that the director wasn't only concerned on the main characters, Julie's, suffering but also that of people that surround her. This includes an elderly woman and a hooker, the film is equally invested in the troubles of others. One thing I found questionable as something the character would do is Julie's decision on the house. It didn't seem fitting to make her seem so selfless. The film has an amazing score, and is visually stunning. One small scene that shows the visual excellence is the sugar cube sucking up the coffee. Emotionally difficult to watch, but in my mind an essential.",

Both are French films about normal people dealing with death, both are anchored by strong performances, and both happen to have Emmanuelle Riva (though she's the star of Amour and only has a tiny part here). But whereas Amour was cinematically dull and literal, Blue is an engaging, interpretatively rich experience.\n\n Juliette Binoche plays Julie, a woman in grief. At the very beginning of the film, her husband and daughter die in a car accident. She spends the rest of this movie attempting to deal with this trauma, mainly by moving to a new place and dropping all connections to her previous life. The movie might sound like a tear-jerker from that plot description, but it's actually quite restrained and deliberate.\n\nThe film was written and directed by the Polish auteur Krzysztof Kieslowski (I can never remember how to spell his name), and it's the first part of a loose thematic trilogy. Just in terms of its surface aesthetics, it's hard to imagine a more visually expressive movie. Slawomir Idziak's cinematography is beautiful and striking. Watching the movie is at times like watching a living Van Gogh painting. The fact that this movie was made without digital color-correction is astonishing.\n\nThe narrative is not obviously tightly constructed, but certain story threads do come up repeatedly. The point, I suppose, is less to tell a particular story than to have us try to understand this woman's strange grief. That the movie does this so effectively without ever being melodramatic or overbearing is admirable. This movie isn't going to hit you over the head with anything, except the color blue itself, which is everywhere - clothes, sets, objects, lighting, everything. This movie is much richer and more interesting than I have even been able to do justice to in this review. I can't think of anything else quite like what I've seen of Kieslowski's work",

You know how the vast majority of people roll their eyes at any mention of foreign or art house cinema? Movies like Blue are the reason why. Pretentious, showy, artificial and nowhere near as profound as it thinks it is, this film centers around one woman's grief following the horrific accident that claimed the lives of her husband and only daughter. I'm all for ambiguous mood pieces, but what happens when one takes minimalism to its limit with a largely vacant protagonist? What is really being communicated? What is this film saying about grief, coping and the pursuit of repairing a broken life that hasn't been said far better in countless other films? Kieslowski's gimmicky directing, painfully obvious symbolism and nonsensical camera tricks are stilted at best, and absurd at worst. \n\nAnd that score. You know, the laughably invasive one that bulldozes you right before he cuts to black... only to reopen on the same scene? It's self serving enough to make John Williams blush. It doesn't take a genius to recognize that this trite score seems to swell during Julie's (Juliette Binoche) moments of specific introspection (get it? Because her husband's music/legacy/memory haunts her. How clever!), but I couldn't help but roll my eyes upon seeing Kieslowski go back to this well time and time again.\n\nAnd that ending. It seems to start with Julie having sex in a glass box full of water (?), and ends with an overwrought roll call of all the film's characters looking deep in thought. What is this, a film school thesis project? \n\nI've read countless articles that defend this film's abstract (i.e. meandering) nature by calling it \"poetic cinema.\" Put Blue up against anything from Bunuel, Fellini or Jodorowsky's canon and it'll pale in comparison. The aforementioned directors deal in poetics as a means to tell a story, to explore a character. They don't need to trout out every single trick in a filmmaker's arsenal to cover up for shallow, half-baked ideas. If you're like me, and constantly feel compelled to defend art house foreign cinema from the mediocrity that dominates mainstream cinema, do not present Blue as evidence. It only reinforces every single stereotype.",

He, a composer, had been working on a piece that would have been throughout Europe, something that will never be finished now. Upon finding herself once again able to walk, Julie heads to the medicine cabinet and attempts to swallow as many awkward-looking pills as possible, hoping that they'll end her life. You don't go through with it with those kinds of monstrosities, and Julie is forced back to her room. She won't attempt suicide again. This is how Three Colors: Blue begins.\n\nEventually, she manages to recover enough to be released from the hospital that was holding her hostage. Or at least, it seemed that way to her. She had to watch the funeral on television. She could barely move. But now she's free, and is going to move on with her life. The old Julie died, and the new Julie is going to work on self-improvement, get a new career, begin anew. At least, that's what you hope she'll do. Instead, she begins burning (both literally and figuratively) everything that reminds her of her past. Friendships ended, all of her and her husband's work is gone, her mother is put into a day home, she moves to a new apartment without telling a soul, and effectively destroys everything she once loved.\n\nAnd for what? She's hurt, we get that, but what does she hope to accomplish by doing this? She becomes a reclusive person, not making any friends -- nor hoping to -- living alone, ignoring everyone she meets, and living a pretty sad life. She doesn't cry, though; her emotions have been repressed. This is what she's decided. She makes, perhaps, a friend, named Lucille (Charlotte V\u00e9ry), an exotic dancer. But there's little joy in this relationship, with the two characters coming to each other for comfort, nothing else.\n\nAlso there for consolation is one of Julie's husband's friends, another composer named Olivier (Beno\u00eet R\u00e9gent). They spend one night together soon after Julie returns home, as she knows that Olivier loved her. But after that night, she tells him that he'll forget her and that she's just like any other woman. She even gets cavities, we're told. And it's after this point where he begins a search for her as, like I said, she's effectively disappeared.\n\nWhat follows isn't all that complex, and yet it's beautiful. You don't go into this film expecting a complicated plot. There really isn't much of a plot at all, really. \"Woman tries to find her new place in the world while removing memories of her past\" just about sums it up. It unfolds elegantly, and I can't remember a moment when I was bored. The main character is so complex that it's hard not to want to just watch her go about her daily life. And if that's not enough for you, the imagery, symbolism, odd shot choices and other techniques used by director Krzysztof Kieslowski surely will be.\n\nThere's a lot to look at with this film, and there's a lot to follow even if you're not paying attention to the plot. It would take multiple viewings to pick out most of the imagery used in Blue, and even then, you're unlikely to get everything. I can see how that would frustrate more impatient viewers as they won't get much out of the movie, but for those willing to give it the time and commitment, it'll be very rewarding.\n\nWhile watching the narrative, you'll notice some key things. The main character, Julie, will frequently stare off into space, just like the camera will sometimes give us a close-up of something as mundane as a sugar cube. We'll also experience blackouts before Julie makes a major -- or sometimes minor -- decision. The musical score appears to be not just played for the audience, but is also inside Julie's head, playing randomly whenever the dialogue dies down or Julie spends time alone. She notices it and reacts to it, sometimes, and it usually follows and is followed by one of those blackouts.\n\nThe only real problem I had with the film was its ending, which went against the main theme that it seemed to be going for. Obviously, I won't give away the ending, but everything about it screams \"hypocrite.\" Or maybe just \"make up your mind.\" But, effectively, it doesn't match up with the rest of the film. It needed to be left more wide open, I thought, in order to bring proper closure to what we just sat through. The way it ended simply didn't quite gel with everything else.\n\nThe actors in Blue are good, but unremarkable. Juliette Binoche carries the brunt of the weight, and while she's good, the role didn't appear to be much of a stretch. The supporting actors aren't given much to really work with, and calling their characters developed would be a bit of an overstatement. This is a one-person show -- as it really should be -- and the supporting actors, while fine, don't get to shine as a result.\n\nThree Colors: Blue is a great film about a woman who needs to overcome her grief and realize what life is all about. While it doesn't contain an engaging plot, its lead character is one that is so interesting that a complex plot might take away from her story. We care about her, and the film focuses on that as a result. The only problem comes from the ending, which didn't quite fit in tone with the rest of the film.",

If I give all I possess to the poor and surrender my body to the flames, but have not love, I gain nothing. Love is patient, love is kind. It does not envy, it does not boast, it is not proud. It is not rude, it is not self-seeking, it is not easily angered, it keeps no record of wrongs. Love does not delight in evil but rejoices with the truth. It always protects, always trusts, always hopes, always perseveres. Love never fails. But where there are prophecies, they will cease; where there are tongues, they will be stilled; where there is knowledge, it will pass away. For we know in part and we prophesy in part, but when perfection comes, the imperfect disappears. When I was a child, I talked like a child, I thought like a child, I reasoned like a child.

As Kie\u00c5>lowski said in interviews at the time of the film's release, \"the subject of the film is liberty, specifically emotional liberty, rather than its social or political meaning.\" That sets the tone for Blue, a moving and compelling drama. When famous composer Patrice de Courcy (Hugues Quester) and his daughter in a car crash, his widow Julie (Juliette Binoche), also in the accident, survive. Distraught at the loss, she tries to kill herself, but fails. Struggling to come to terms with what's happened, Julie cuts herself off from her past and all of her friends and relations. Even though Julie has the final, unfinished work that Patrice was commissioned to do destroyed, it transpires that Patrice's musical assistant Olivier (Beno\u00c3 (R)t R\u00c3 (C)gent), has a copy of the work, and wishes to complete it to honour Patrice's memory. Julie refuses, she has enough on her plate, especially when she finds out Patrice's mistress Sandrine (Florence Pernel), is carrying his child. It's a very good film, well made with some good performances, Binoche carries the film brilliantly, and the visual narrative is near flawless. It's a film about coming to terms with loss, moving on, readjusting our lives in face of tragedy. It got Kie\u00c5>lowski's Three Colours trilogy off to a good start, with 2 more films to come.",

Her attempts to isolate herself and escape the nagging memory of her late husband and child fail, and she's drawn back in through chance meetings with strangers, her husbands renowned music, and one of her husbands secrets.\n\nI loved the camerawork in this film, as well as the use of the color blue, but Juliette Binoche's performance is all the film really needs. Her eyes could out-act half of the Hollywood-wannabes in the industry today. Her stare is warm and beautiful, yet houses so much sadness.

            "content": "Even though I am clueless regarding Krzysztof Kieslowski's other works before I even laid my eyes on \"Three Colors: Blue\", and even though how frustratingly misleading the little summary on the back of the DVD really is, I still immensely liked the film. But not in a way how I may like a straightforwardly well-written film. \n\nDeviating from filmic conventions, although it is in fact a very linear film, \"Three Colors: Blue\" manages to convey the deepest of emotions not much through storytelling but more through calculated camera movements and stunning cinematography (by Slawomir Idziak). And with that, the film has managed to make me appreciate its wholeness in much the same way how a beautifully experimental musical piece may capture a music lover's heart.\n\nWith a title that suggests immediate melancholy and visuals that further this emotional atmosphere even more, \"Three Colors: Blue\" is more of a mood piece than it is an immediate narrative. It is, as it flexes its finely-toned existential muscles, an emotional spectrum subjectively seen through the eyes of a middle-aged woman named Julie, played by Oscar winner Juliette Binoche, who, after being involved in a car accident which claimed the lives of both her husband and child, decided to completely remove herself from the life that she has always cherished and loved. \n\nStarting her aimless goal by selling their house, all the other things in it, and burning the difficult concert piece that her composer husband has written to commemorate the unification of Europe but sadly hasn't finished, Julie rented an apartment in a not-so-affluent part of Paris and started to live her life in utter isolation, save for some slight interactions with other people here and there (with a young prostitute being the most notable). \n\nBut even though she wants solitude, there's Olivier (Benoit Regent), a colleague of Julie's husband, who constantly shows his love for Julie but is seemingly contented by the quite sad fact that he can only show it in futile admiration. But despite of that, he is always ready to support her in the midst of her emotional plight and is also eager to finish her late husband's concert piece. For a film (again, back on the DVD's summary fiasco) that has promised utmost 'mystery' and 'seduction', \"Blue\" is surprisingly warm and affectionate in its romantic notions and never, even for once, stooped down to an extremely sensationalist, 'sex for the sake of it' level. \n\nThe film is also quite rich in its visual interpretation of emotional alienation and frustration. With Kieslowski uniquely using sudden fades into black in scenes whenever Julie is met with the difficulty of answering questions that may unveil what she's really feeling at moments, and ingeniously injecting blue-colored objects to enforce the film's recurring color motif, \"Three Colors: Blue\", as it progresses, patiently develops into a purer form of art house cinema that criss-crosses between realistic human emotions and esoteric overtones.\n\nForm and content, message and execution, these are the most basic requirements for a film to be considered as an artistic whole. For this film, Kieslowski balances both on a very thin wire as if a cerebral circus performer, seemingly experimenting as he paces along, even with one outweighing the other, but nonetheless, a walk that is not without a clear finish. \n\n\"Three Colors: Blue\", as a whole, surely is a fine piece of foreign cinema that seeks to inform its audience that there's no such thing as a generalized emotional milieu for a certain societal stream. 'Existence is isolation', Kieslowski, in part, may have had in mind as he works with this film, but it can never be denied that he has created the film with a concrete glimmer of hope and a beautiful melody somewhere in his mind. \n\n\"Blue\", the first chapter of Kieslowski's \"Three Colors\" trilogy, is a very effective drama film about tragedy and artistry. But more evidently, it is an ideal example of how brilliant the art of cinematographic composition, partnered with some achingly beautiful music, can really be when skillfully pushed to absolute perfection.",

Juliette Binoche is transcendent as Julie, a woman who has just lost her husband and daughter to a terrible car accident from which her own life was miraculously spared. Would she call it a miracle that she was left alive while her entire family she had worked to create was taken? I cannot think that this would be the case. However, as we see in the movie, the tragedy of death is very real. Yet the need for that which is alive to go on living is equally real and important. That which is alive must live; and that which is gone must be remembered. I could go on and on about the themes which this movie explores, and the various depths of emotions which it unveils, but I'd rather you just go and watch it for yourself. It is a fantastic experience and a wonderful affirmation of pain.",

Each of the films has a theme that it subtly and ambiguously explores, and Blue's is liberty; but not the kind of political \"Braveheart 'FREEEEEDOM' \" that you would normally think of. No, this is more like liberating one's own emotions and overall outlook on life. Apparently, Krzysztof has very delicately intertwined these 3 unrelated stories, and I can't wait to see how he does it. Most people I know would say this film is \"boring, slow, uneventful, and plotless,\" and for all of those people, I sigh and feel sorry for you.

Visually stunning with a pitch perfect score, the opening film of Kieslowski's acclaimed Three Colors trilogy and first entry into his filmography is an utter marvel for the eyes, the senses, and the heart. Utilizing a sapphire look to the film to encapsulate the main theme of grief, the film tells the story of Julie (Juliette Binoche) grieving after the death of her husband and daughter. After initially shutting off the world, she learns to reopen her heart and move on after his death by returning to her generous and loving self. Open to a wide variety of interpretations, it is a tough task to try and put your finger on what this film is ultimately trying to say to you, but one thing is certain: it is brilliant.\r With a beautiful score from Zbigniew Preisner, the music takes center stage in Three Colors: Blue with numerous scenes fading to black to allow the music to really hit some high notes before fading back in to continue the scene. There is even a sequence at the end where Kieslowski opts to have the camera go out of focus as Julie and Olivier (Benoit Regent) work on finishing the concerto written by Julie's late husband Patrice. A beautiful sequence of indescribable melody, the film's music really encapsulates the sheer beauty and wonder of this film. I am no music expert, but to say that the music in this film is beautiful and meaningful would be a terrific understatement.\r The cinematography is beautiful, but then again, I am a sucker for any significant use of color as is displayed in this film. Often signifying depression, sadness, or simply grief, blue is used to perfection in this film. Though not every shot is draped in blue, certainly a significant portion of it is displaying blue to some degree. The way in which Kieslowski works in the color in seemingly mundane ways is brilliant and highlights the detailed and subtle nature of this masterpiece.\r On that point, Three Colors: Blue is an incredibly detailed film that demands to be re-watched multiple times in order to not just pick-up on everything that Kieslowski is laying down, but to also try and come to some kind of determination as to what the film is telling you. For me, the story is about a woman grieving and learning how to deal with that grief. After initially destroying everything that meant something to her old life and liberating herself from that weight, she learns that the past cannot be escaped. Instead, by embracing her past and letting herself move past the pain, she will liberate herself from it. Rather than running, she can stand still and move past her immense grief. That said, maybe I am way off.\r Overall, Three Colors: Blue practically never puts a foot wrong. Impeccably crafted with a wonderous score, beautiful visuals, and incredible heart, Three Colors: Blue is a moving, stirring, and passionately told story about loss, grief, and liberating yourself from that grief.",

The aftermath of such a major upheaval, the repercussions that it costs and the emotions a person goes through, is what's this tale about. But don't jump on the conclusions yet, Kieslowski is a real trickster when it comes to storytelling. His range is so vast and detailed, that you find yourself floating in its bubble staring at the abyss beauty of it. Armed with jaw dropping score and eye popping cinematography, this is certainly a cinema at its peak. The narration follows the protagonist from the first frame till the curtain drops.This is something that isn't often seen. And addition to that, to keep the audience still tangled in its pathos bubble and rooting for the characters is what sweetens this layered cake. The screenplay is tightly packed with gripping plot and adaptive metaphorical tone that is beautifully poetic. Even though the entire concept is dipped in brimful of poignancy, the language of the picture is utterly soothing and hopeful to the core. Kieslowski keeps giving you back at each definite interval, he genuinely cares about the quality of his story. Binoche is literally the soul survivor of the movie.She has the potential to melt you down within the first few minutes of her screentime. And when she is offered such a three dimensional character, she soars against all the hokum of your expectations and stunningly fabricates her portrayal onto the screen, this is arguably the best work of her career. Chugging down all the viscous material and loping it up on the screenplay, Kieslowski pushes the boundaries of cinema to newer territories and builds a safe home for the script. Trois Couleurs: Bleu is fairly one color foliated into many, and it is that transition that the makers succeed at.",

Neither of them makes a logical sense. Logic aside, however, neither can spare us such an inexorable phase or get us out of it miraculously. Julie seems to have veered into the latter route in order to evade slipping down the abyss of the first. But grief must take its natural course, and suppressing it would result in truly dire circumstances at their worst scenario would be being imprisoned by depression, shrouding us metaphorically until a shroud takes its place quite literally.\"Now I have only one thing left to do: nothing. I don't want any belongings, any memories. No friends, no love. Those are all traps.\"Kie\u015blowski incessantly tries to save her from such fate and draw her back to life once again. His camera lingers in extreme close-ups on Juliette Binoche's features to draw out of them a smidgen of the sadness Julie does her utmost to bury inside herself. Later on as Julie keeps pushing grief away in her quest of severing herself from the past, she finds herself drawn back to it as memories surround her everywhere and no matter hard she tries to escape them. When she returns back to her home for the first time after the accident that cost the lives of her husband (a renowned music composer) and her daughter, she asks the gardener if he has emptied the \"blue\" bedroom, which implies her trying of getting rid of the past. She goes upstairs only to find a \"blue\"-beaded chandelier, that's likely belonged to her daughter, hanging over her, just like her memories of her daughter. Julie's journey of liberating herself, in one sense, from her past life becomes impeded with reminders of her two dears she lost. Furthermore, Julie's incomplete grief begets anger and irritability that put her mental state at stake. And as memories relentlessly haunt her, she ends up surrendering to them, literally having her head under (blue)water. However, blue gradually begins to mutate its symbolic significance as liberation takes on a totally different definition in Julie's mind. It's here where Zbigniew Preisner's score blossoms into a salvaging tool. There's one scene, in particular, that I found fascinating where Julie and her husband's colleague trying to complete her husband's unfinished manuscript. The shot is pulled out of focus until it becomes almost utterly blurred, forcing the viewer to hear the music playing inside of their heads as they orchestrate parts of it. It's still a liberation of the past, but one of letting go of it while maintaining, nay cherishing its memories instead of eliminating them. A liberation that thrives on a catharsis for all of Julie's repressed painful feelings, bringing forth her deepest sobs and setting her free.",
