I first saw it in the theater in 1993 and I was rooting for it to win Best Foreign Film Oscar, but it lost to the far inferior Belle Epoque (Spain). As to the person who wrote that this film made Cheng Dieyi seem like he was made to be gay because of abuse, I think you need to take another look. To my mind, Dieyi seemed to be infatuated with Shitzou as soon as he got there. However you look at it, this is a film that has great performances all around. I especially loved Leslie Cheung as the adult Cheng Dieyi (requiem eternem Leslie, 1956-2003), not to mention Gong Li. An excellent film, but be forewarned: it's almost three hours long. 10/10",

            "content": "I finally got a chance to see \"Farewell my Concubine.\"  I'd been anxious to see it since its initial release in 1993.  It surprised me in its depth and technical skill.Three points make this film outstanding.  The first is the technical skill of the director and the luscious taste of the director of photography. The entire film is a feast for the eyes, taking full advantage of elaborate costumes and exotic locations.  The second strength is in the actual storytelling.  The plot is a fascinating tragedy, it feels almost Shakespearean.  The acting is nothing short of incredible.  Some of China's finest actors demonstrate their ability to carry a story that covers 52 years.  Normally, these two strengths alone would be reason enough to see a film, but \"Farewell my Concubine\" succeeds in satisfying one more category (the bain of any epic): historical accuracy.\"Farewell my Concubine\" is exceptionally accurate in portraying the monumental changes that were sweeping China at the time.  The film doesn't just treat these events as background events, but drags them right into the plot and pins the characters into their surroundings.  This is interesting when you consider that the story takes place in the Peking Opera, not the most likely place for these events to have effect.  Instead, as we see the new China emerge, we watch these vestiges of old society fall, and the work of all involved make this transition an achievement to behold.  The power of this film was not missed by Chinese censors who banned, removed, and then banned the film again several times over -debating whether or not its artistic brilliance was worth subversive portrayals of suicide and homosexuality.  Unlike \"The Last Emperor,\" this film was made by Chinese film makers and is in tune with its subject.  I recommend this film highly!As one last note, the version I saw was a DVD containing the original 170 minute version of the film, in its wide-screen splendor.  From what I understand, the shorter versions released internationally deleted and shortened some opera scenes for fear that they would be lost on Western audiences.  Having no prior experience with any Peking Opera, I found the scenes fascinating and integral to appreciating the entire story.  Spend the extra time if you can.",

            "content": "As an WASP American married a lady from Mainland China, I have a great interest in and curiosity about China. My wife's mother and father actually saw these men perform. I have discussed this movie with many Chinese friends, most of whom saw it before coming to this country. Some of them knew the story from real life as well as the movie. They are quick to point out the accuracy of the story in its detailing of Chinese history from the end of the last dynasty until its end during the Cultural Revolution. They also claim that the major happenings in the movie are real events, not the norm for most of Hollywood's \"real life\" stories.  One point of conjecture in the movie is the sexually of Dieyi. It is presumed he is/becomes a homosexual.  However, from what I have learned about the Peking/BeiJing Opera through reading and discussions, it is more likely that Dieyi was virtually unaware of his own sexuality.  As opposed to being a hetero or homosexual, he was asexual in a way like it had be surgically removed from his being. It had been taken from him through the rigors of his training and years of performance.  His love for Xiaolou is powerful, maybe even surpassing ordinary man/woman love, but platonic in as much as his mind is devoid of its sexuality. He suffers the same jealous anger and sense of betrayal as might be found when a wife discovers the cheatings of her husband, and reacts, unfortunately, accordingly (Heroin). His real, enduring love is performing. It is the one constant that has seen him through.  He throws himself into it, being willing to perform for anyone, even as it drives the story to the end.  The end of the movie is not satisfying to everyone.  It was not a Hollywood ending.  However, it was reality.",

It is a beautiful film with gorgeous photography, invisible direction and fantastic acting. What struck us most about this film was how many levels it had. It was a story about politics, love, life, faith, all rolled into one exceptional package. Yet none of these messages are hammered into you. They just flow over you in well-timed waves. Many of these Chinese movies are so interesting because of their unique perspective. It's wonderful to immerse yourself in a great film from a different culture. The many points of beauty in this movie are subtle, delicate and drenched in China's magnificent history. You have to experience it for yourself to understand, and once you do you'll fall in love with the world of Chinese cinema.",

            "content": "As far as story and content goes this owes more than a little to The  Last Emperor (1987), which is not surprising since Director Kaige Chen  was a member of the cast of that film and no doubt was influenced by  its success. But stylistically, and especially as the film was directed  and cut, \"Farewell, My Concubine\" is original and stands alone. If The  Last Emperor was a Western movie about the Chinese political experience  in the Twentieth Century, then Farewell, My Concubine is a Chinese  movie, influenced by the West, about that same experience. While the  former focused on the emperor and those around him, \"Farewell...\"  focuses on two actors of the Beijing opera.   Admittedly, \"Farewell...\" is long (I saw the 157-minute version) and  sometimes strays from it intent, but gains and maintains power and  keeps our interest mainly because everything is presented in a  starkly-lit, intensely focused manner. The epic-like story itself is  good if a little pedestrian at times. The lavish and stunning sets in  opulent color and design, are just fascinating to view. Everything from  the extras in the crowds to the porcelain for tea is carefully chosen  and presented. Particularly striking are the traditional costumes and  makeup, shown to advantage through the fine camera work. But what makes  the film is the glimpse we get of the world of the Beijing opera and  its traditions. From the Dickensian boy's school for the actors to the  intrigues with patrons and the political powers that be, there's the  sense of a world beyond our experience.  The acting was also excellent. The beautiful Gong Li, who played Duan's  wife was captivating as she displayed a wide range of emotion. Leslie  Cheung as Dieyi, \"the concubine,\" and Fengyi Zhang as Duan, \"the king,\"  were also excellent. The boys who played the actors as children,  especially the actor who played Douzi, were first rate.",

            "content": "Spoilers herein.Opening scenes are seductions, promises. They transport one to the world of the story and establish who you as viewer can expect to be. Done right, they are an art to themselves. This film's opening is among the best I've seen, establishing the world of performance: politics as theater and love as both. It lets you know the perspective is centered on a stylized stage and concerns loss, sexually ambiguous brotherhood and betrayal. All in a couple minutes.And then it unfolds. That unfolding is not wound tightly like the entry; it keeps the play outside the play notion, but epically sprawls. This is clearly a film worth watching, but not all the character/actor combinations are powerful enough to carry the epic scale.There is something that bothers me. China is an old civilization with its own stylized conventions of storytelling. We somewhat see those in what is depicted on stage, but the film uses none of them, instead taking a strongly western stance. The dissonance is jarring, especially since so much is made of the symmetries between the film and the opera. This is somewhat true with the style of acting, but in that dimension I admit that innovation is near impossible. But the stance of the camera! We went through a dynastic-like period, a Japanese period, a brief nationalistic one, and then a couple iterations of mob totalitarianism (with a Soviet flavor). But except for the sets, nothing changed so far as the environment in which the narrative was presented. Should have, could have. Instead we have the Hollywood style as transferred through budget-conscious Hong Kong: Static camera, few setups, languorous editing.",

            "content": "While 'Ba wang bie ji' (aka 'Farewell My Concubine') has been labelled as a tragic epic what really makes it stand out is its depth and attention to detail at the same time while telling an engaging story. Like Akira Kurosawa's 'Ran' ''Ba wang bie ji' Kaige Chen's film is like a tragic poem on canvas. The vivid colours, the emotionally moving opera songs, the vivacious cinematography and luscious visuals all compare the film to a beautiful painting. Lillian Lee's superb screenplay (adapted from her own book) involves the viewer in Chinese history and the lives of Dieyi and Xiaolou. It beautifully introduces the viewer to the history of Chinese opera and also demonstrates the radical transformation that took place before the emergence of New China.Leslie Cheung gives a magnificent understated performance that is skillfully restrained. Even though his characters displays shades of darkness and malice, there is a humanity that draws immense sympathy from the viewer as one witnesses his life falling into pieces. Fengyi Zhang too does a great task as Xiaolou, who is in many ways Dieyi's polar opposite and his best friend (and love of his life). Gong Li is sublime and makes full use of her time and powerful expressions.I had been postponing watching the film because of its time length and I wanted to reserve 3 hours so that I can watch it in one go and devote my full attention to it. I was right to do so because this film deserves the viewer's full attention. It might be an overwhelming experience but one that is enlightening and worthy of the almost three hours (avoid the cut version).",

            "content": "This is one of my favorite all time films, and I associate it with another of my faves, Remains of the Day. Both films deal with unrealized love over a backdrop of important historical events that directly or indirectly affect the main characters. Both films are extremely well made with lavish color and attention to details. Both offer a sort of built in history lesson for the viewer, and both are adaptations of novels that are in themselves worth reading.Farewell My Concubine has more of an epic sense about it, and has been made even more so with the 170 minute DVD version. Being of Asian descent, I thoroughly enjoyed the additional opera scenes. But, as others have indicated, the singing will probably have an adverse effect to western audiences as the movie progresses. As with any novel adaptation, there are many differences between Lillian Lee's book and the film. I personally would have liked some things in the film to have stayed closer to the book, but overall, the film definitely is able to stand on its own and, I feel, does the book justice. Banned twice in China, once due to the veiled homosexual themes and later for Dieyi's suicide at the end (authorities insisted suicides never happened in China), this film nevertheless is the result of an unusual amount of artistic freedom given to director Chen Kaige, and he exploits it to the full. This is especially true during the Cultural Revolution scenes, which casts a negative light on the Communist government. Kaige's experience as a former Red Guard provides a frighteningly accurate portrayal of the terror during this period.I initially viewed this movie because I am constantly mesmerized by the skill and beauty of Gong Li (who isn't?). But I quickly became fascinated with the outstanding performances of Leslie Cheung and Zhang Fengyi, not to mention the children of the opera school in the first part of the movie. I will agree with the reviewer who stated that the constant beatings of the children is a little harrowing. But it does make one realize that sometimes other cultures in other times put different values on human life than we do.One of the main points of the film is how the stage role of Concubine Yu Ji paralleled the life of Dieyi in his offstage life. I found this to be eerie as I discovered that Leslie Cheung's real life in many ways mirrored Dieyi's character. Cheung was a huge pop superstar in Asia during the 80's, and widely known for his gender bending styles of dress onstage. Cheung himself said that the role of Dieyi was, in fact, him, and I would not debate this. Speculation that depression and a failed relationship with his male lover led to Cheung's suicide a couple of weeks ago, somewhat similar to the plot in the movie. Perhaps life imitating art??A great film made even greater with the additional footage on the DVD. Not recommended  for small children, homophobes, anyone expecting martial arts action, or those unable to sit through more than 2 hours of movie watching.",

Opera performers Douzi (Leslie Cheung) and Shitou (Zhang Fengyi) get to know each other in a Beijing orphanage in the 1920s. They stay friends over the years, but then courtesan Juxian (Gong Li) comes between them. The Cultural Revolution also complicates things.This is one of the movies that I would recommend to anyone who wants to truly understand why China is like it is today (another is Steven Spielberg's \"Empire of the Sun\"). The impact that the Japanese invasion, the communist revolution, and then the Cultural Revolution have on these two men is beyond mind-blowing. The movie does not shy away from the disasters that the Cultural Revolution caused; I get the feeling that China's government was not too happy with the movie. But above all, it's important to understand how the world's most populous country (and likely dominant power of the 21st century) came to be what it now is. A very good movie.",

            "content": "I have had a great deal of trouble writing this review. Every time I make a start I can find nothing to get my teeth into and no coherent thread to interconnect my thoughts. While there are many potential sub-topics they all seem to stand in isolation. While this may simply be a reflection of my inability to string two sentences together I think in this case it pretty accurately summarizes the issues I have with this movie.It is difficult to figure out what this movie is and if asked to summarise it in 25 words or less I would be flummoxed. Is it a Chinese history movie? An opera movie? A Chinese culture lesson? A love story? A story of betrayal? A story of pseudo or actual homosexuality? It is snippets of all of these and probably more, but it does not really do justice to any of them. Basically it suffers from multiple personality disorder and unfortunately we don't get enough time with any of them to relate to any of them. Yes, the history and cultural aspects are interesting in their way but don't really add anything to our understanding of the horrors of the Japanese invasion of China, the Nationalist/Communist struggle, the early Communist era and the later Cultural Revolution. Yes, it is a \"love story\" between the two actors who play the King and the Concubine, but we never experience any passion or come anywhere close to connecting to either of these characters to really care. The \"King\" character in particular is very undeveloped, little more than a cardboard cut-out who happens to be the object of the \"Concubine's\" unrequited love. The character played by Gong Li is also skin deep and we never really care about her or her relationship with the \"King\" actor \u2013 indeed the random and non-sensical way in which these two characters become engaged simply nukes any credibility that this relationship might have had, and by extension destroys the credibility of any other relationship on the movie, most importantly the pivotal one between the \"King\" and the \"Concubine\". The betrayal, which I gather meant something personal to the director, is dealt with too curtly to have any effect at all. The character of the \"son\", raised from an abandoned baby, is totally illogical and we simply don't get to know him well enough to care about him or understand why he would possibly want to betray his adoptive parents. It all just seems facile and silly. We never really understand (or at least, I don't) the \"homosexual\" overtones of the \"Concubine\". Was he simply beaten into a form of insanity in which he thinks he is always in character as a woman? Is he actually a homosexual? His \"king\" friend seems to be too thick to understand the \"Concubine's\" feelings for him and this to me trivializes the whole \"affair\". And to be honest, none of the characters come across as being particularly nice, in fact the Concubine character comes across more as a petty, whinny, jealous, lightweight flake than a tragic figure we could weep for.OK, just because a film is not perfect doesn't mean you should not watch it. \"Farewell My Concubine\" is one of those films which is a \"must see\" despite its failings. If it falters as an emotionally satisfying and coherent movie it is a stunning technical tour de force and a masterpiece of its kind. Just to have made a movie of this scope is an achievement, almost to the point that its success is secondary, crazy as that may sound. It is a movie of such breadth that it is impossible to take in completely in one sitting, and that is perhaps the ultimate test \u2013 you know you need to see it again to understand it but can you care enough about it to make that effort? But \u2013 trust me - you need to see this movie \u2013 your education as a movie goer is incomplete unless you do. You will enjoy it, and you will be moved to have an opinion, one way or the other.",

            "content": "Like the French, the Chinese seem to produce nothing but incredible movies; movies that are so culturally rich and psychologically grounded that they are almost like novels.  Farewell My Concubine is about the cultural revolution in China; with the relationship between two heroes and the heroine being a microcosm of this movement.Dieyi, who plays Concubine Yu to Xiaolou's king, represents the old society of corrupt, but noble, decadence.  Warped by abuse and betrayal, victimisation literally turns him in on himself, until he becomes homosexual in so many ways.  The grim passivity, of  which his homosexuality is only one facet, is bitter and snide on the one hand, but stoical and brave on the other.  The suffering and ugliness that lies behind his elegant pristine act (as Concubine Yu) is like the hardship, toil and exploitation that was behind the old society (with its palaces and silk clothes created by the tired hands of the proletariat).  Through combining both the ugliness and the beauty of the old society in one character, the film is able to justify it: the proletariat and the nobility are one, their suffering is one, and their triumph is one.  This is forcefully iterated in the scene where communist pupils attack Dieyi's aesthetic preference for noble ambience on stage (beautiful backdrops portraying aristocratic gardens rather than proletariat metal pylons).  We feel the injustice and hypocrisy of their ideology, for Dieyi is tougher than any of them; he has suffered and toiled harder than the most exploited slave in the history of mankind.Where Xiaolou represents practical masculine reality, Dieyi  represents art: he talks with a distanced air of finality and confuses the opera with everyday life.  This is, for the most part, rooted in psychological realism. When Dieyi is beaten he refuses to cry because his artistic temperament detaches him from rationality and gives him a tragic-heroic identity which sustains him: to cry would be death for him.  Xiaolou, on the other hand, chooses to grapple with reality and play up to the masters who beat him; he takes the lashings with comic defiance and exaggerated pleas for relief. The film only goes wrong when it becomes Dieyi's mouthpiece, condemning Xiaolou for betraying him.  In the world of the film, it is no more fair to say that Dieyi  is braver than Xiaolou than to say that Xiaolou survives where Dieyi  perishes: within their own vital spheres,  both prevail.Xiaolou's wife, is a beautiful subtle portrayal of womanhood.  From her beginnings as a whore (physically and emotionally) she grows in  stature until she chrysalises into the film's most worthy character.  The compassion and fortitude with which she tolerates her husband's operatic partnership with Dieyi, even when it is responsible for the loss of her unborn child, is heroic in a womanly sense (a kind of heroism rarely acknowledged in literature or film).  Her pity for Dieyi  outweighs her jealousy: she nurses him out of his heroin addiction as if she were his mother (his mother was, significantly, a prostitute from the same whorehouse as she).  However, at the end, when the two of them have both been denounced by Xiaolou, the characterisation slips into sentimentality: instead of bearing Xiaolou's callousness with contempt (as she does when he hits her earlier) she gives up on life.Like many of the greatest works of art, this film is flawed and it is the ending which reveals and embodies this flaw: sentimentality.",

            "content": "The basics: two young Chinese boys go to opera school together in the 1920s, and grow up to become big stars.  Their lives revolve around their specialty act, the classic Chinese opera, `Farewell My Concubine,' to such a degree that their offstage life begins to reflect their onstage one (shades of `I Pagliacci').Everybody loves FAREWELL MY CONCUBINE but me.  And I can certainly see why they love it: it is an epic view of the story of China's 20th century, magnificently shot.  All the same, it leaves me cold for much the same reason that another epic, DOCTOR ZHIVAGO, did.  It is chiefly the story of what happens to the protagonists, not the story of what they do.This is also why, again unlike everybody else, I like the second half of this movie better than the first.  The second half has Gong Li in it, who (in addition to making the film more beautiful, as she would any film) is the most dynamic character present, the one who most determinedly takes her destiny in hand.  It has the courtroom scene, which is the only one where Daeyi tries (and fails) to influence his own fate.  And it has the Cultural Revolution scene, where Shitou finally makes an important decision with immediate, and tragic, results.The first half, on the other hand, I found almost unwatchable.  Behind disgustingly coarse subtitles, we are forced to endure scene after scene of little boys being tortured.  I just don't enjoy that sort of thing, and I frankly feel uncomfortable about those who do.  It might be different if the torture actually had a purpose, if the kids were suffering in order to achieve something, but it is made deliberately and brutally clear that this is not the case: the teachers act with the same sadism toward both the good and the bad students, and think nothing of completely destroying their precious talent by maiming them, killing them, or driving them to suicide. Furthermore, the first half appears to portray Daeyi's homosexuality as being something he learned in his youth.  This does not accord with scientific observation, which clearly suggests that homosexuality is not a learned behavior.I admit I am being cynical here, but I believe that Daeyi's homosexuality has given this movie a popularity with the faux intelligentsia that it would not enjoy otherwise.  Many who would denounce the love triangle as clich\u00e9 if it consisted of two men in pursuit of the same woman will claim to suddenly find the formula interesting when, as in this case, it consists of a man and a woman in pursuit of the same man.  After all, this movie dares to ask the question, if a straight woman and a gay man both love a straight man, which will he choose?  What do you mean, you guessed already?  This is a Great Dramatic Question, dammit!My first exposure to Chinese opera was from Zhang Yimou's RAISE THE RED LANTERN, where I found the performance of the opera singer quite enchanting. I'm afraid I did not enjoy the operatic element of this movie nearly as much.  To my Western ear, Daeyi's singing voice sounds grating.  The masks generally look grotesque.  The acrobatics, I admit, were very impressive, lending an energy to the performance that Western opera would benefit from. But for me, opera will always stand or fall on the vocal performances, and those were lacking.  This is probably another reason I didn't enjoy the movie: if I had felt the beauty of the opera as many Chinese do, and could have shared the two principals' passion for it, I wouldn't have found the experience of the movie so unmoving.Rating: ** out of ****.Recommendation:  What can I say?  Everybody else enjoys it; don't mind me.",

            "content": "A re-visit of this probably, most accoladed Chinese film in the 20th century, Canne's Palme d'or winner (an honor deservingly shared with Jane Campion's THE PIANO 1993), two Oscar nominations, and other awards galore. Directed by Chen Kaige, the trailblazer of \"The Fifth Generation\" directors (along with Zhang Yimou) in China, FAREWELL MY CONCUBINE has remained as his most intrepid and accomplished work ever, it is a chef-d'\u009cuvre goes right down in the annals of the entire history of cinema.The full version runs about 170 minutes, and spans over 50 years, it traverses through the turmoil times of contemporary China. Starting from 1924, in the Republic of China (1912-1949), a 9-year- old boy Douzi (Ma, Yin in different ages) is left by his prostitute mother (Jiang, in a devilish showy cameo) to a Peking Opera troupe, run by the rigorous Master Guan (Lv), under whose extremely strict coaching measures, where physical punishment is meted out on a daily base, Douzi is trained to play female roles due to his feminine appearance, and strikes an intimate affinity with a senior fellow apprentice Shitou (Fei and Zhao). An agonizing process of Douzi's dragooned shifting from cisgender to trans-gender paves the way for his success in the field, but also foreshadows his tragedy where he can no longer retract himself from his female character, Yuji, whom he plays in the traditional play \"Farewell My Concubine\", she is the loyal concubine of King Xiang Yu, played by Shitou. Projecting him and Shitou as Yuji and Xiang Yu, Douzi loses his grasp of the fine line between reality and performance, but Shitou isn't.Time jumps to the Japanese invasion in the 30s, when Dieyi (literally means butterfly's dress, the stage name of adult Douzi, Cheung) and Xiaolou (means small pavilion, the stage name of Shitou, Zhang) have become star opera singers, mostly for their collaboration of \"Farewell My Concubine\". A crack occurs, when a headline prostitute Juxian (Gong) contrives her way to marry Xiaolou as an opt-out from the whorehouse, the inseparability between Yuji and her King is deadly breached, Dieyi feels betrayed, but the show must go on. Through the rapid-changing political landscape of its time, from Japanese, Kumingtang, to the Communist Party, which established the PRC in 1949, until the Cultural Revolution in the late 60s, the trio experiences a string of tumultuous happenings: miscarriage, opium addiction, imprisonment, trial for treason, disciple betrayal, etc., which Chen dauntlessly brings about with no trepidation of the harsh censorship of the government (the film was denied a theatrical release in mainland China, for obvious reasons), and reach its apex in a heart-rending criticism and denunciation meeting encircled by the Red Guards, where Dieyi searingly lashes out his disillusion, spite and wrath, once and for all, it finishes with an abrupt but poignant suicide. Then, after out of contact over a decade long, the two brothers finally reunite on the stage for their grand finale with a highly cinematic coda.This is Hong Kong legendary star, Leslie Cheung's most audacious and dazzling endeavor, whose personal back-story (as a closeted gay man, he committed suicide on the April Fool's Day 2003 because of depression, at the age of 46) in retrospective makes his brilliant impersonation of Dieyi more plaintive and heart-breaking to watch, his impeccable semblance of a woman in full cosmetics is deceptively alluring, yet he is far from being a pretty face, his subtle facial impressions, gestures, line-delivery and body language all precisely hit the perfect note of a soul desperately clinging to his illusion, driven mad by jealousy, deeply disheartened and traumatized by the milieu.Zhang Fengyi's Xiaolou, wonderfully balances Dieyi's delicacy with his macho superiority and bluntness, which is tune with the strategy to intentionally sidestep the elephant-in-the-room in their relationship, and makes the case more like a meta-identity confusion tale than a taboo- divulging melodrama, homo-erotic tension has been mostly taken out, whereas vignette between Douzi and a senior eunuch is not for the faint-hearted. Xiaolou is only the king in the opera, back to reality, his virility is a false front, and he is ready to snitch on everyone when difficult time approaches, but we cannot blame him, he is no hero, but an ordinary man tries to save his life, most of us would do the same, right?Gong Li, the goddess of contemporary Chinese cinema, grabs a meaty supporting role here, becomes the unwelcome third wheel among the two men, her Juxian, is a woman knows what she wants and never hesitates to get it, she is tough, manipulating but not vicious, one of the most poignant moments is when she and Dieyi establishes a semi-mother-and-son bond during the latter's cold turkey period, that is the only time, hostility caves in to warmth and affections, yet it is evanescent, her only mistake is that she puts all her stakes on a wrong man and sticks to him afterward, among all the main characters, she is the most ambiguous one but Gong's expertise makes her the most sympathetic one too.Gu Changwei's Oscar-nominated cinematography, the exotic atmosphere around Peking opera scenes and a distinctively oriental score by Zhao Jiping, even popular comedian Ge You's subdued performance in a drama role, one can ramble on and on, but in the end of the day, it needs to be seen by more audience, particular young Chinese filmmakers, simply to show the world that Chinese cinema can produce masterpieces despite that it has been stuck in the dry spell for too long, with an ostensibly booming market congested with utterly inferior commodities.",

            "review_title": "'Gone With the Wind' of China",
            "content": "An apt functional definition of art is 'a stylistic representation of an artist's views through a given medium.' A style can take many forms, such as realism or surrealism, but what all styles hold in common is the conveyance of a message. Films like \"Farewell my Concubine\" are political in nature, expounding a philosophy that \"the personal is political .\" This movie is a high-style epic drama, which is why some critics call it \"whiney \" or \"soapy .\" Although there are melodramatic elements in the film, it should not be taken at face value, but instead as representational of Chen Kaige's deep-seated feelings about the status of the Chinese people. What appears to be a story of love and betrayal amongst tumultuous political change is in fact a criticism of the dissociation between Chinese politics and Chinese culture, causing major problems throughout an individual's life.The dichotomy between culture and politics and the tension therein caused, is shown by three broad elements: Peking Opera representing culture, extraneous political forces, and people living in between art and politics. By examining how all three elements interact we will see the director's political views and how the personal lives of characters figuratively represent the dilemma of the Chinese people.What lies between culture and politics is the individual. The individual, like a canvas is painted by environmental factors. For Douzi and Shitou, the principle characters, their first impression in the film is the Peking opera. The Peking Opera as an environmental factor represents culture. As the troupe leader says while the children are going through difficult training, 'the Opera is what makes us human, without it we are but animals.' As people, our culture is our humanity . Food, art, clothing, religion, and ceremony culminate to create 'culture.' Without it, we could scarcely define ourselves apart from animals. The Peking Opera represents Chinese culture, and purposely so. Few elements could capture the true complexity and nuance of a culture like Peking Opera can. The movie, developed in the last three-strip Technicolor lab , allows the colour, technique, flexibility, and more, to show the product of the cultural embellishment in Peking Opera (Chinese culture). As well, to fully integrate into a culture, one must suffer cultural hazing. Douzi undergoes many initiations. His finger being chopped off, a pedophilic encounter with an old man and continual beatings for not accepting cultural role are examples of his initiations. But after accepting the throws of culture, he finds comfort and stability within his culture. Douzi's transfer of his stage character, the concubine, into real life is an affirmation of his cultural identity. The concubine must suffer in the opera, and therefore so must Douzi. The climax of his suffering is his own death, which is the ultimate instatement of cultural identity. At the opposite end of Douzi is Shitou, a character who is far more politically oriented than Douzi. Shitou can be considered a cultural sellout, someone who sees survival as more important than tradition. At the heels of Cultural Revolution Shitou abandons his history. For example, when both King and Concubine discuss their art to the young communists in an acting class, Shitou yields to the political flame of communism, agreeing with the young communists. And as artifacts of his cultural history are being burned in the streets (books and swords), he too dumps his personal history into the flames (wife and friend). Douzi can do nothing but kill himself, out of love for king and country, because his king has lost the final battle.The tension between Douzi and Shitou embody the tension between Culture and politics. Chen shows that one end of the spectrum must suffer at the hands of the other. Throughout the film we feel sympathy for a dying way of life, especially as we grow to know more about the nature of Peking Opera. Our sympathy for opera suggests that alien political systems antagonize the cultural system, and therefore are an object of criticism. This is most apparent during the Cultural Revolution when traditional artifacts and ways of life are brutalized. The 'culture of revolution' according to Marx should destroy a bourgeois' past, and establish social and economic equality for the masses . Instead, what the Cultural Revolution destroyed was what made all Chinese equal and great, their cultural heritage. The revolutionists may have dispelled capitalist motivations, but first and foremost they destroyed the love between man and woman, between king and concubine, the very symbols of beauty in this film.At the end of the film there is a concession to Chinese culture, when a Peking Opera is put on to celebrate the operas 200th anniversary. In Chen's China this is reality, a country opening up to the world and to new ideas. The only way to protect itself from ideological domination from America and other influences is to protect its heritage, and part of that heritage is the Peking Opera. For China to ensure the safety its heritage, the culture that has shaped individuals for thousands of years must also shape modern politics. Openly celebrating Peking Opera in Chen's film is making the personal 'political', and merging the two dichotomous entities into a single unifying element for China.",

The historical aspect was good: showing the history of China from 1924 to 1990 through the eyes of two friends who happen to be opera stars. This is quite powerful and edifying, especially the communist era, showing the oppression the average person faced (and still faces, to a degree).The story about the two friends is less interesting though. It starts off badly enough: the boyhood era was repetitive and overplayed. We got it the first time: the teachers were sadists and the boys had it very bad. No need to labour the point.Their story does get more interesting with the introduction of Juxian as she changes the dynamic of the friendship and the film. Still, everything seems laboured, with scenes and sub-plots being drawn out unnecessarily.The most powerful part, and almost the only reason to watch the movie, is towards the end, during the Cultural Revolution.

They not only survive this ordeal but become star performers, famous throughout all of China.As adults, the macho Duan Xiaolou (portrayed by Zhang Fengyi) and the effeminate, delicate Cheng Dieyi (Leslie Cheung) maintain a strong friendship, but they are not lovers. They are joined by Xiaolou's vibrant, sexy mistress Juxian (Gong Li).Alert for following spoilers telling about major plot developments!!Dieyi has a fit, unfairly seeing Juxian as a rival. Yet, Dieyi is later comforted in a crisis by Juxian, who gives him the maternal care he had always lacked and craved; he learns to trust her. Meanwhile, the passion between Duan and Juxian survives other challenges.These three overcome turmoil and oppression during the occupation of Peking by the Kuomintang and Japanese armies and later during the early years of Communist rule. Dieyi continues to star in female roles, especially as the tragic mistress to Xiaolou's doomed warlord in 'Farewell My Concubine.' The 'Great Cultural Revolution', however, provides a most cruel test. A horde of Red Guards storms the opera house, seizes them, puts them on 'people's trial', and forces them to recant their 'reactionary' ways. The sadistic mob next demands that the three denounce each other. Dieyi, timid and frightened, yields to their threats and accuses Juxian of having been a traitor\u0085conveniently forgetting that Juxian had earlier slept with a Japanese officer only in return for protecting all three of them.

She becomes the tragic concubine to whom we must bid farewell.The anticlimactic remainder of the film includes how Dieyi's kindnesses to an apprentice opera singer are rewarded with treachery\u0085strong retribution for what was done to Juxian.At the end, much later, Xiaolou and Dieyi find themselves alone in the empty opera house and suddenly replay their famous episode in 'Farewell My Concubine.'

            "content": "It is near impossible for anyone who admires Chinese cinema to profess a distaste for this film. Without a doubt, Farewell My Concubine is arguably director Chen Kaige's most famous and critically-acclaimed work. Perhaps the second best known filmmaker to emerge from China after Zhang Yimou (Ju Dou, 1990; Raise the Red Lantern, 1991) in the late eighties, Chen often has to perform in the shadow of his ex-cinematographer. But it is Farewell My Concubine that finally landed him the accolade he so deserved \u2013 the Palme d'Or from Cannes, and the fame that resulted from it. Farewell My Concubine stars two actors at the top of their game \u2013 Leslie Cheung and Zhang Fengyi. They play two opera singers who enthrall countless legions of fans with their skillful rendition of the opera which the film is named after. Cheung plays \"The Concubine\", a feminine character of grace and elegance while Zhang plays \"The Gangster King\" who is forced to leave his concubine and escape from an invading army. Chen's film chronicles the friendship and struggles of the actors who play these two characters over a span of more than half a century, with China's tumultuous modern history set as the temporal backdrop.Farewell My Concubine begins on a very impressive note with its first hour being one of the most compelling examples of the hypnotic power of great Chinese cinema. The consequence of such a potent beginning is that the film's power would start to fade, and this is evident from a second act that occasionally meanders due to the film's loose narrative structure, which could be improved upon with tighter editing. Maybe there isn't this issue with the theatrical version, which runs about twenty minutes shorter.Nevertheless, Farewell My Concubine is still highly engaging, and an eye opener even for Chinese viewers, let alone Western audiences. The cultural value of Chen's film is highly obvious with its very detailed depiction of the intricateness and artistic elaboration of the Peking Opera style as much a revelation as it is striking. Coupled with the traditional use of percussion and suona (a high-pitched Chinese trumpet), the opera sequences open the door to a mystical experience never before felt on the big screen. In other words, an obsolete art form becomes fascinatingly alive through the medium of film.Chen's direction is supreme. His mastery of tracking shots, handling of large crowds, and eye for period detail are impeccable. His treatment of the film's story is also well-handled despite some of its flaws. But strangely, even though the acting is strong, there is still not enough emotional pull to make us fully empathize with the characters, most notably that of Gong Li's. She plays a classy prostitute who after coaxed by Zhang's character, falls in love and marries him, an act that causes tremendous strain on his friendship with Cheung's character.Banned in China for some time because of its negative portrayal of communism and its implicit homosexual content, Farewell My Concubine remains to be Chen's finest hour as a filmmaker. In some ways similar to Bernardo Bertolucci's The Last Emperor (1987), this epic spans across five decades and is a splendid showcase of the exemplary use of color and lighting to tell what is one of the most memorable stories to emerge from nineties Chinese cinema.GRADE: A- (www.filmnomenon.blogspot.com) All rights reserved.",

Then add a gigantic helping of Sado-Masochism, and you'll get something remarkably similar to Farewell My Concubine. Taking this into consideration, the praise this film has garnered is almost inexplicable.The first 50 minutes focus solely on the child abuse of the two lead characters. None of the characters are remotely likable because everyone acts as if they are certifiably insane while on PCP. Children escape their abusers, only to then return and actually beg to be beaten. Boys lick each other's flesh wounds while dressed in drag, or simply pee on each other's heads. Old men (when they're not asking stupid questions like, \"What year is this?\") get their kicks off of beating little children or making them pee into little glass bowls. How the hell could anyone consider this tripe entertaining? Thankfully, the film calms down for the final 120 minutes (and yes, it lasts almost three excruciatingly long hours), when a woman obstructs the friendship of the two leads. But even during the better portions of the film, the negatives still heavily outweigh any positives: (1) The sadomasochistic obsession of all of the characters rears its ugly little head on multiple occasions. The two lead characters welcome their despotism with near fanatical graciousness, and structure their entire existence to facilitate this repressiveness. This film almost glorifies abuse.(2) The death of the troupe master is unintentionally hilarious.(3) The entire subplot of the conflict with the Japanese practically derailed the main plot of the story.(4) The subplot of Gong Li's miscarriage was played down too much, when it could have contributed greatly. It seemed to have little to no effect on the primary storyline.(5) The film fails miserably to earn the viewer's sympathy for the characters. The lead character renounces his love for Gong Li. Gong Li kills herself. The film then fast forwards 11 years to imply that one of the male leads kills himself. It all seemed so ad hoc and cheap to me \u0096 a way of cheaply earning sympathy at the very end of the film.Farewell My Concubine was a major disappointment. I was expecting it to rank amongst some of the newer classics (The Road Home, Happy Times, In the Mood for Love, Shanghai Triad, Kikujiro, 2046, Dolls, Sonatine, Eat Drink Man Woman, Hana Bi, The Isle, Chungking Express, etc.). Unfortunately, it simply fails to entertain in any significant way. The first 50 minutes annoyed me; the final 120 bored me.So basically, if you enjoy watching men dressed in drag while singing at glass-shattering pitches that must have required the inhaling of a blimp full of helium, then Farewell My Concubine might be for you. Otherwise, stay far away from this one.Update: Just saw Yimou Zhang's \"Raise the Red Lantern\", which blows this movie away on every level. See that one. Forget about this tripe.",

If you are not in this history, you may have a lot of confusion.Even 157 minutes of movie time can be boring.The story begins with Peking Opera.This is an ancient oriental drama with incomparable dreams.It means the same to China as Shakespeare's plays do to England.But the story is not limited to it. Instead, it takes Beijing opera as the background and takes us into those 50 years with the life of two Peking Opera actors and Chinese history.You can see the change of government, the civil war, chaos, despair, obsession, and the biggest cultural destruction revolution in history.You can realize the fall and annihilation of an ideal character.Film photography is also excellent. Lens transformation, wide-angle, mobile photography, coupled with the color of memory, film directors and photographers use skilled skills to combine a large number of messy scenes into a wonderful story, and use these stories to create epic.In addition, I would like to thank the film actors for their wonderful performances. Zhang Guorong even got the best actress nomination of Cannes Film Festival. There are nearly a hundred characters in the film, but each one is very impressive. Their vivid performance will let you immerse in that period of history without feeling strange or weird.I highly recommend this movie!",

            "content": "An intriguing tale, with a fascinating chunk of modern Chinese history serving as the background. Spanning over 50 years, the film tells about the ups and downs of a traditional Peking Opera troupe, and its two stars, from 1924 to 1977. Not only do we see the various political events of the time, but also how the traditional opera and its stars are treated during different eras.The two stars, Dieyi and Xiaolou, are brought up and trained to play specific roles - that of concubine and king respectively - in a famous play. Dieyi (Douzi) is trained, or should I say, forced to behave, sing, move and dance like a girl, from a very young age. The two of them share a unique and close bond, and this balance gets affected when a woman, Juxian, enters the picture. Their political naivet\u00e9 get them into many problems, but it's their properly unresolved love triangle that causes more trouble.The lines between fact and fiction are blurred when we realise the similarities between the play and their actual lives. Dieyi's devotion to opera and Xiaolou are as strong as the concubine's devotion to the king. (The lines are blurred even more when Leslie Cheung, bisexual himself, takes his life in 2003) The end is inevitable, as we realise while the story progresses, but it's reached with proper momentum and after an intriguing chain of events.The acting by the three leads is really terrific. Leslie Cheung as the female-role playing opera star who's completely devoted to his art, Fengyi Zhang as a talented and playful man who can easily separate his private and work lives, and Gong Li as the prostitute-turned-wife whose shades of determination and compassion keeps us from not having a fixed view of her character. With Chen Kaige's talented direction and Gu Changwei's spectacular cinematography, the movie has many colourful and memorable scenes.I really liked the movie, and wasn't bored for a single second. The movie deals with so many interesting themes - Modern Chinese history, sexuality, art and its reception, devotion and passion - but yet it somehow makes me feel that it had the potential to be much more compelling. Other than the political events, the characters could have been explored a little more.",

In another sense, though, I guess it's clear enough. It's about the close friendship between two actors in the Chinese opera, traced from the warlord era of 1924 through to the end of the Cultural Revolution in 1977. Whatever is lacking in the flow of the story, though, is more than made up for by some of the very strong content.First is the look at the Chinese opera itself. In the west, opera is a sort of niche entertainment; certainly not something that has mass appeal. In China, though, the \"opera\" is mass entertainment, and its performers can become major stars, as in the case of Dieyi and Xiaolou, whose friendship is the focus of the film. The friendship is tested in many ways, most particularly by Xiaolou falling in love and marrying a prostitute, and then by the barbarism of the Cultural Revolution, which is briefly but chillingly portrayed. The costumes and sets of the operas are dazzling (the film's title is apparently the title of a Chinese opera.) In the end, while the story has its weaknesses, the movie is worth watching for the look into Chinese culture and history. 7/10",

Through the story of two Beijing Opera stars, the movie shows an scroll of the Chinese social change among more than 50 years. It also focus on the ordinary people's hardship and suffering.\nAlthough the love is the topical subject for this movie as its name shows. But I think the director want to express more than love. It tells much more about the humanity under the extreme conditions.\nIn one word, a person cannot say he is familiar with Chinese film if he hasn't seen this \"farewell my concubine\".",

The story about two Peking opera brothers, their life behind stage with love betrayal and anguish.I didn't experience the period from 20s to 70s. But as a born Chinese I know the fifty years history very clear. China changed a lot in this period. From feudalization went to an independent democratic country. I have to mention Chinese traditional education about opera player's training. I guess many people felt miserable and pitiful when the teacher was beating opera apprenticed kids, I just want to say it was very common in opera school at that time and every actor must take it if he desires to fame. Even now a few of parents still hit their children especially in countryside families, because they believe no kids grow well without severe chastisement. It's a part of Chinese traditional culture obviously. Certainly, I don't think it's right.The second issue I wanna point out is Culture Revolution(66-76), the disastrous fault in China modern history. Duan solo(Zhang Fengyi) betrayed his loyal wife(Gong Li) and disclosed his brother's(Leslie Cheung) past when they were animadverted in film. Why he did that, I think the revolution twisted his soul. If anti-Japan war and the civil war destroyed the material of living, I ought to say the revolution destroyed all the generation of my parents. They didn't accept entire education and become a tool of politics. Young men didn't know what the revolution is and why it exists at that time at all.A great movie all in all, pathetic ending, but be doomed to that. If a person finds he had lost the meaning of life and not hold pain brought from fate any longer. Nothing left but suicide to him. Worthy of spending three hours to watching if you are interested in Chinese culture and what happened in the past.",

            "content": "This film follows two Beijing opera stars (stage names Cheng and Duan) from their youth in 1924 to a final performance in 1977. Cheng is somewhat effeminate and plays women in the performances, most notably the woman in the traditional opera \"Farewell My Concubine.\" Cheng is gay and in love with Duan who is classically masculine; Duan's feelings for Cheng do not go beyond friendship. Things between the two go along well until Juxian enters the picture as Duan's lover and subsequent wife. The story revolves around the complex emotional interplay between these three, played out against dramatic historical events. The history of China in the years covered would require a shelf full of books, but this movie concentrates on three eras: \"The Warlord Era\" in the 1920s, the Japanese occupation of Beijing during WWII (and its aftermath), and the Cultural Revolution during the Mao era. The interweaving of the personal stories with the themes of the opera \"Farewell My Concubine,\" together with the historical events, is cleverly done. The telling of this epic runs to 171 minutes on the DVD. In keeping with its operatic theme this movie has an overture that sets the tone and piques your curiosity about what is to come. This sequence seemed artificial to me until I understood its intent.Most everyone will be impressed with the sumptuous color cinematography. The opera scenes are impressively filmed and, while I could appreciate the artistry involved, being primarily attuned to Western culture prevented my being captivated on an emotional level as I was, for example, by the operatic scenes in \"Amadeus.\" Cheng's singing sounded more like the harsh screeching of a cat than anything that would engage me. The atonal music and highly stylized acting in the operas were interesting as artistic phenomena of a foreign culture, but it would take significant exposure for me to ever truly enjoy such, if that were even possible.The extent to which this movie offers history lessons is not clear to me, nor is it clear how much is intended. During the 1920s the focus is on Cheng and Duan's training as young boys under the tutelage of a sadistic taskmaster. The child abuse is so graphic that some may be tempted to avert their eyes. Was the brutal treatment of the boys a symbol of the brutality of the era? I don't know. The political pressures of the Cultural Revolution must have been extreme in order to provoke the personal denunciations we see toward the end.One thing I found odd was that, while the characters must be at least sixty years old by the end, they look like they are still in their 30s.I admire this movie for its ambition and could appreciate it on an intellectual and artistic basis, but its epic sweep and cultural differences kept me at a distance.",

This could only be filmed in China, in their native manner. You'll also get an education about Chinese history, even though you may have lived through it all and didn't understand it. I encourage you to read all of the comments given here - I'm sure they contain many aspects of the film that I've missed, the several times I've viewed it......and, I haven't seen the uncut version.It is very easy to determine that \"Douzi\" (Leslie Cheung) is flat-out gay from the moment you see him, although some reviewers characterize him as \"asexual\". He is thrust into a brutally cultural \"opera-school\", where living the performance is mandatory. Although most of the students deride the tender-looking boy, one of them (Fengi Shang, \"Shitou\") recognizes he's found his life-companion and actor/actress partner. There is little subtlety in his protecting this fragile boy. Of course, as he ages, he also must live his heterosexual life, and hides his true love by repeatedly telling \"Douzi\" he is fantasizing, he cannot separate his persona between the stage and his true life. BULL ! the only time he denies his strong love is during the revolutionary (?) Chinese era, to save his own neck.During this couple's rise to national stardom, there are some strange and extremely fascinating characters introduced into the story - including the fabulous portrayal of a whore-turned-loving wife by Li Gong (\"Juxian\"). I have learned to recognize the characters by their faces: I don't even ATTEMPT to remember their names.I won't reveal any of the story, because that's the pleasure of understanding it in-spite-of the difficulty of keeping-up with it, from the Chinese. One learns that the world's people ARE the same, no matter what race they may be - and that human nature is no different, only exploited and twisted to suit a nationality's purpose.As many have written, this is a movie to view as a life-experience. It is powerful and gorgeous, pre-\"Brokeback Mountain\" in another language. Director Kaige Chen made a masterpiece from Lillian Lee's (and other's) writing. I can fault nothing about this film. Every intelligent adult should see it several times, to capture the multi-staged plots and realize life is life, no matter where you live it.Definitely a 40...........see it !",

Between them is the wife of one and a former prostitute, Juxian, played by Gong Li. The relationship among the three is often very complex, and goes through plenty of turmoil, but Dieyi and Xiaolou and the Beijing Opera somehow stay together.This movie to put it simply is beautiful, particularly during the opera scenes. It's one of the most pleasing movies just to look at that I have seen in some time. It's also beautifully told. With so much ambition it could have been way too complex for someone not familiar with the history to understand, but it's actually quite direct and flows fantastically from one section to another.The two acting leads do good jobs, but it's Gong Li that stands out. Her character evolves greatly at first from dislike of Dieyi to sympathy and even tenderness. In her marriage to Xialou she wants him to quit Opera, but eventually accepts it and sees it as a necessary part of his life. Gong Li is the main heart and soul of the film, and this is the best acting work I have seen from her.This certainly stands as one of the five best Chinese language films I have ever seen. It's not completely flawless, some of the earlier scenes I think are a bit heavy-handed, but overall this epic and tragic story for friendship and love is a must see.",

The scenes of beatings and personal insults, especially when the principal characters were very young, seem altogether too brutal in the effort to make them remember their lines and deliver them effectively. It would seem more of a detriment to me to have that kind of pressure inflicted on someone. Perhaps the most distressing aspect of the story has to do with Xiaolou (Fengyi Zhang) and Cheng (Leslie Cheung) declared traitors and enemies against the People during the 1966 Cultural Revolution, when all they were doing was what they had always done, performing their roles to the applause of an appreciative audience. It only goes to prove that one's fortunes are largely dependent on those in power governing in their own self interest.",

It is commonly believed that kongfu movies are brought to try to amuse Oscars; they are tasted just like McDonald's and with little value to us.But Ba Wang Bie Ji (farewell ,my concubine) is fairly thought as an excellent movie made by native Chinese director (unfortunately it is his only masterpiece, I think).The other day at a famous movie fan website of China, 95% or more voted it for the best Chinese movies all time with another two or three.Regular viewers of IMDb could not probably understand what the movie is about.The name of this movie comes from a play of Beijing Opera, the Beijing Opera is usually adapted from old Chinese history, of which are well-known by Chinese people.In this tragic story happened in the end days of Qin Dynasty, a fistful of heroes chase the power. Xiang Yu (Ba Wang) is the most heroic and romantic one. But finally he is defeated by his cunning rival Liu Bang who is the founder of Han, what Chinese ethnic majority names after. In an intense battle where Ba Wang is embattled, his army is totally destroyed, his beloved mistress, Yu Ji, tries to persuade him to run away and come back with recruited armies. Ba Wang refuses to leave her, so she kills herself to let her man leave. This is not a complicated story but much too tragic and touching (Ba Wang kills himself too as he is too shameful to go back to his hometown).In the movie, the opera adapted from the old story was performed in early time of Republic China, when the country was in a mode of civil war and natural disasters. As a tradition of the Beijing Opera, actors playing feminine roles were all males.Sometimes they were mentally displaced by considering himself a woman.Die Yi devoted \"herself\" into the opera and fell in love with the hero Ba Wang performed by Xiao Lou, and that was why this is not a gay movie.It was long ago before the last time I saw it, and I barely remembered plenty of details of the plot. But one thing impressed me was the mix of modern-history and life between the roles and actors.In one word, it is not just an excellent opera of the ancient tragedy but a real story about the actor and \"actress\". Xiao Lou and his \"woman\" experienced the regime of Japanese and civil war and he actually married a woman as his real wife. The play is so well-known and popular that even the communists allowed them to go on playing. During the Culture Revolution, many people were insulted and abused if they were suspected to have connection with capitalistic enemies or simply categorized as counter-revolutionists. Die Yi was also humiliated and tortured at public because \"she\" once performed for the Japanese invaders to rescue Xiao Lou during WWII.As it usually happened those days, the one who was judged as counter-revolutionist would be rejected by his family and friends. Xiao Lou was too scared to speak for Die Yi, \"she\" finally killed her self on the stage where she was so popular during a temporary rehearsal with Xial Lou, as the role did to herself 2000 years ago.It might be a coincidence Leslie Cheung killed himself ten years later after the movie hit the screen,which was anther tragedy adding to the whole story lasting for 2000 years.Ba Wang Bie Ji is seldomly the movie which is widely accepted both by Chinese and foreigners, it contains much about history and modern revolutionary activities, and it is so tightly connecting the fabrication and reality\uff0cwith childhood and adulthood,romance and betrayal, dream and consciousness, life and love, a bridge over old and modern China,even the final destiny of the actress on stage and actor on screen. There's only one movie that can compare to it in the world",

It goes here and there, a frenzy of pictures, sometimes tragic, sometimes funny, always keeping your attention peeled. Somehow it lost me a bit from then on however.As the turns of history was woven together with the opera, it was no longer as involving. All the actors were exceptional, but lost a bit focus in the history part. I also suspect the history part to be one-sided. It was very tragic and brutal, but to this extent? I don't know, and should the film take it unto itself to paint broader it would end up twice its length perhaps. Its ambitious and almost there, but I like 'Huang Tu Di' better.",

            "content": "It's quite funny who I discovered Farewell My Concubine. I was looking for some records in a second-hand shop in Montreal when I saw a gorgeous Korean boxed set including a DVD of this film as well as its soundtrack. Since this Korean version of an old Chinese film was quite obscure, the package only cost three dollars. I assumed I couldn't do anything wrong purchasing this film and I was indeed not disappointed at all when I finally watched the award-winning classic. The airy soundtrack is also quite unique.Farewell My Concubine is based upon a novel of the same name and depicts a surprisingly honest picture of Chinese history throughout the twentieth century. The movie follows a young boy named Douzi whose prostitute mother tries to get rid of him by any means necessary. She cuts his supernumerary finger with a cleaver and then sends her son to a group of young boys who are trained to perform Peking opera. Douzi is bullied by the other kids because of his origins and regularly beaten and intimidated by adults. He is further humiliated by being forced to act female roles but manages to perform brilliantly with his best friend Shitou. He even endures sexual abuse by an eunuch to hold on to his dream to become a star and have a better life. But even when he becomes a renowned star, Douzi's life seems to be cursed. His best friend slowly drifts away from him when he marries a selfish prostitute. His patron tries to seduce and abuse him. Political forces accuse him for having been forced to dance for Japanese generals. Despite all the hardship, Douzi doesn't stop believing in a better future.Despite a few lengths over a running time of nearly three hours, the movie has numerous strengths. The film is a critical portrait of Chinese history from the mid-twenties to the mid-seventies and shows how societal and political forces of different origins abuse, menace and persecute the protagonist alike. The costumes, settings and soundtrack are detailed, emotive and inspiring. The acting performances are intense and especially lead actor Leslie Cheung fully convinces as homosexual actor, dancer and singer who is never fully accepted by society. The film has a gripping melancholic atmosphere and there only very few inspiring hopeful moments as opposed to numerous grim setbacks. This intellectual movie certainly isn't easy to digest but offers incredibly rewarding food for thought.One thing that needs to be pointed out is that famous actor Leslie Cheung plays the greatest role of his life in this ambitious epic drama. The parallels between his character Douzi and the actual actor Leslie Cheung are almost creepy regarding his stardom, sexuality and fate. That makes the movie even more thought-provoking in hindsight and shows that the film has aged quite well.If you like ambitious and epic dramas and are interested in Chinese culture, history and society, you should watch Farewell My Concubine. The movie is emotionally gripping, historically accurate and intellectually challenging. It has aged quite well and shows an extraordinary lead actors who fully identifies with his role.",

            "content": "Probably the most important parts of making an engaging film is having strong characters (although there are exceptions). They don't have to be particularly unique, but they are our window into the story, and they give us the emotional investment we need to see them through to the end. What makes \"Farewell My Concubine\" so emotionally stirring is that the three characters in this film are people we know and understand (if not always like), and who are swept up through years of societal change and turmoil, and that's on top of the interpersonal conflicts between them.The film details the lives of two life-long best friends, Dieyi (Leslie Cheung) and Xiaolou (Fengyi Zhang). The two are \"stage brothers,\" acting partners in the Chinese Opera. But then Xiaolou meets, and subsequently marries, a beautiful courtesan, Juxian (Gong Li). This angers Dieyi, who is gay and wants to be partners with Xiaolou on-stage and off.All three of the performances are stunning. Leslie Cheung has the most complicated part, and he is superb. Dieyi is not a likable person; he's spiteful, arrogant, manipulative and traitorous, especially to those who like him. But he is a deeply conflicted character who has suffered so much at the hands of others that we can't help but feel for him. That's probably why we understand the compassion that Xiaolou, and surprisingly Juxian, have towards him. As Xiaolou, Fengyi Zhang has the least showy part (Xiaolou is more of a reactionary person), but Zhang gives the character the sense of individuality that he needs. Xiaolou has his own set of moral values, but with times changing so rapidly and dramatically, he's going to find out just how far he's willing to go to keep them. Then there's Gong Li, the international sensation who's been dubbed \"The Asian Meryl Streep.\" As Juxian, she's almost like an older sister to the wayward Diyei; she doesn't like him, but offers him her support nonetheless (probably because of her love for Xiaolou, but you never know). She's stubbornly loyal; no matter how bad things go, she always sticks by those who are close to her.Director Kaige Chen is an expert at developing his characters, but his storytelling needs a little work. There's a little too much subtlety here, and at times there seem to be missing pieces in the narrative (however small and insignificant they may be). Yet, these characters are richly developed, even the ones who seem small and unimportant, are all so compelling that Chen deserves much credit.Emotionally complex and richly rewarding drama, \"Farewell My Concubine\" is a near-masterpiece of Chinese cinema.My rating: Rated R for language, some strong violence and sexual content, and disturbing images.",

Basically set in the 1920s and continuing through to the aftermath of the Cultural Revolution, this is the story of how performers Douzi (Leslie Cheung) and Shitou (Fengyi Zhang) became friends and talented actors in the Beijing Opera. Later however Douzi wants to be more than friends, Shitou does not give into his advances, the situation worsens when courtesan Juxian (Li Gong) manipulates Shitou into rescuing her from a life of prostitution, and then marrying her, while Douzi is in fact homosexual. The friendship and relationship status between Douzi and Shitou goes up and down through the changing times over fifty years of Chinese history, but they remain close, but it is unclear whether they can return to the way things used to be, and the show must go on. Also starring Qi L\u00fc as Master Guan, Da Ying as Manager, You Ge as Master Yuan, Chun Li as Xiao Si as a teenager, Han Lei as Xiao Si as an adult, Mingwei Ma as Douzi as a child, Zhi Yin as Douzi as a teenager, Yang Fei as Shitou as a child and Hailong Zhao as Shitou as a teenager. I will admit having to read the subtitles I could not follow absolutely everything going on, but the acting is certainly well done, the colourful sets and costumes certainly grab your attention, and the theatrical performances are interesting to watch, all in all I think the film is a worthwhile art house drama. Good, in my opinion! It won the BAFTA for Best Film not in the English Language, it won the Golden Globe for Best Foreign Language Film, and it was nominated the Oscars for Best Cinematography and Best Foreign Language Film.

            "content": "In this movie based on Lilian Lee's masterpiece, Chen Kaige has mainly developed the evolution of the 'sentimental' link between two actors (one gay one) through the turbulent history of China in the 20th century, with the fall of the Empire, the Japanese occupation, the civil war, the communist victory and the Cultural Revolution. The Chinese opera \"Farewell My Concubine\" functions marvelously as a leitmotiv. The sentimental relationship between the two actors, and later with the lover of one of them played superbly by Gong Li, will be seriously shaken during the political earthquakes. Although 'everyone should be responsible for his own fate', everybody, if he isn't strong enough physically or psychologically, could be forced to betray his friend by false accusations, particularly during violent public interrogations. The political message of the film can be summarized by the slogan: 'Cursed are the tyrants who plunge their people into misery.'With unforgettable scenes, like the abandonment of a child by his mother, the rigorous training of the young aspirant-actors, the public political trials or the meeting of 'old friends', Chen Kaige translated perfectly in moving pictures (with sublime color grading) Lilian Lee's text.Nevertheless, Lilian Lee's book transcends all personal relationships with her sublime meditations on art, the artist, individual life, love, death and politics. One example from the book: in the ordinary world, victory and defeat, life or death are only during the time of a wink. But art and artists are not part of this world, where politics with its slogan 'kill or be killed' only sow pain, suffering and misery. Through art, the spectators escape during the spectacle for a few hours the harsh reality of life and enter into a world of dreams and deepest emotions, which are embodied in the actors (of Chinese operas). This movie is a must see for all lovers of world cinema.",

Why didn't the corrupt democracy of Chiang Kai Shek and Sun Yat Sen survive? Corrupt democracies in other countries survive (look at the US), so why not China? The problems in China go way back to the 19th century, when England created the Golden Triangle (financing opium farms in India and selling the opium to China). This created great wealth and power for the UK, but left millions of Chinese addicted and broken. This led to several revolts in China, such as the Taiping and Boxer rebellions against the Qing, the ruling royals of the country. Both rebellions were unsuccessful in ridding China of Western domination, but they did cause the fall of the Qing in 1911. The Qing was replaced by a \"democracy\" headed by Sun Yat Sen and Chiang Kai Shek.Unfortunately, the corruption and devastation caused by the UK could not be overcome by the KMT (the name of political party Sun Yat Sen headed). So, when people are faced with desperate situations, they resort to desperate measures; enter the CCP (Chinese Communist Party). Initially, Mao Zedong and the CCP were good for China; they gave women equal rights, stabilized food prices, and brought millions out of poverty.However, Mao fell into disfavor immediately after the tortuous 10 years of the Cultural Revolution, where millions starved to death, and economic opportunity ceased to exist. His mistakes were reversed by his successor, Deng Xiaoping, who opened up China to economic development (One Party, Two Systems). This film tries to cover all of these events in only three hours, and partially succeeds in doing so. The personal interaction of the two friends and Gong Li is actually secondary to the events surrounding the three of them. This film was an enormous undertaking by a master of Chinese cinema, director Chen Kaige, one of the two greatest Chinese directors of all time (the other being Zhang Yimou).Kaige would go on to make another great Chinese film, Devil at the Doorstep, a story about the occupation of China by the Japanese. But this film still stands as his greatest work as far as international recognition is concerned. Winning Cannes is not easy, and trying to introduce Westerners into understanding modern China is even more difficult. Kaige was at least partially successful in doing just that. You will know a lot more about China after you view this film, then before you viewed it.",

Google Chu-Han Contention, Xiang Yu (the king/hegemon), Battle of Gaixia. May help to know a bit about the more recent events in modern Chinese history such as the Cultural Revolution too, but that's not at the heart of the story.The best developed character is of course Dieyi. Based on the traditional Chinese role of the tragic heroine, with the additional complexity of gender confusion. not very appealing, despite hitting all right notes of the traditional femininity, unless you got yellow fever. Xiaolou, the king who is not really a king, like Xiang Yu, strong but unable to control his fate. the easiest character to relate to. Juxian is not well developed, the king's horse? Yuang is potentially interesting character, well acted, but again not developed enough.It is Chen Kaige's best movie I've watched.

Before I saw it, I read a little about it, and I was quite impressed to see how the film did well in the West, and managed to infuriate Chinese Communist censors. However, I fear that I was not fully prepared for what awaited me.In fact, the film is truly brutal, in every sense of the word. Director Kaige Chen took a well-known and respected book for his film, but put all the focus on an almost visceral realism. The film is an epic that spans a large period of time, between 1924 and 1977, that is, very troubled years in Chinese history, which includes the entire period of war against Japan and the invasion of Manchuria, as well as the cultural revolution. Maoist.At the same time, it reveals the backstage of Cantonese opera, a traditional Chinese cultural style. In the film, two young apprentices live a cruel and unhappy life at the opera school, with daily beatings and various abuses, including sexual abuse. One of them will play the female characters in the stories, like a transvestite, since women are not allowed on stage. Throughout the film, there is a lot of confusion between life and art, and we often feel that these actors are mixing things up, living their characters in real life and transposing their real life to the stage.I don't know any of the actors in the cast, but I really liked their overall work, and the way they play opposite each other. The film also has extraordinary scenarios, full of realistic details, such as the construction of buildings, the lanterns. The actors' costumes also deserve applause, especially the characters in the opera, with all those fabrics and those strong face paints.

            "content": "I am puzzled by the accolades this film has received. Even as a record of major Chinese historical events, such as the Cultural Revolution, the previous war with Japan, etc. there are other films that addressed those issues better and with more drama.There are several problems with this film. We don't even see a woman until about halfway through the film and they hardly function as major players in the drama. If one pretends to film history, surely women are part of that history, at least as drama if not as historical personalities.Whether women played a part in that history of not, they surely played a part in the lives of these individuals and that part should be dramatized.I am also puzzled by the static way the characters speak throughout the film, which seem to me, at least, racially stereotyped. Surely Chinese people do not speak in longueurs as depicted throughout the film. Why shouldn't they speak the way all people speak? Isn't directing actors in that way a form of stereotyping. It reminds me of the way that extraterrestrial characters speak in sci-fi movies, in stilted ways apparently to distinguish them from Earth people.Apart from the interesting parts dealing with thespian discipline and fandom (worship of actors never really change regardless of the culture or genre of art), much of the first part leading up to the success of the two opera singers seemed needlessly brutal. It reminded me of Rhett Butler cutting Scarlett O'Hara's vitriol short by saying, \"I get the general idea.\"Surely one spanking would have been enough to get the general ideal of corporal punishment, as in Dickens' novels. Did we really have to see B&D throughout the film. Even then, one or two whacks would have been sufficent to convey the general message of corporal punishment. Instead the whacks go on forever. Seriously, WHAT COULD BE THE POINT? Art isn't real life. The artist merely shows dramatically what went on to discipline the players for the Peking (Beijing) opera and that could be done with two whacks before a scene change. WE GET THE GENERAL IDEA. All art is about SELECTION. The difference, as in Shakespeare, is if elaboration (say in King Lear's great speeches) have artistic amplification. Who would want to part with Lear's great invocations against a indifferent universe? But I would gladly part with seeing someone being whacked a dozen or two dozen times. I see no artistic significance in that at all.Moreover, it unnecessarily extended the length of the movie. I would gladly cut the movie by a third without, in my view, loss of artistic significance. But then, as Mark Twain wrote, difference of opinion is why we have horse races. Mahler's symphonies were once called overlong, now they seem too short. Perhaps history will challenge my opinion, but this movie is WAY TOO LONG for its artistic import.But the crux of the failure of this film, in my view, as I hinted above, is any lack of internal drama. We simply know nothing at all about these characters, so why should we care? The fact that there are no women in the movie (apart from the prostitutes) suggests where the problem lies. Shakespeare's history plays did not stint on personal and specifically marital relationships. Lady Macbeth is as important a figure as her husband. The women in King Lear (though not strictly a history play) are counterfoils to Lear, and hence the great drama. Goneril and Regan make Lear the way that Joe Frazier made Muhammad Ali, at least as part of the drama of the fights.Frankly I'm a little weary of every movie being praised for its cinematography, which has become a cliche of film criticism. Today a child can make a film with great photography, with all the skilled camera people at his or her disposal. One finds this cliche in film noir criticism as well. Any film noir movie with low-key lighting is praised as a masterpiece just because it has low-key lighting.I did not find this film more impressive in its cinematography than, say, Lawrence of Araba, Dr. Zhivago, The Last Emperor; yet they also had real drama with real men and women.I will say that Leslie Cheung gave a great performance. Gong Li was wasted and many of the other performers were stilted.As for historiography, I have seen several films with far scarier images of the Cultural Revolution than this. But the documentation of training for the Beijing opera was very well done.",

This is just my opinion, but I think its screenplay followed the pattern(in a way) done by Stanley Kubrick in \"Lolita.\"  That is just my opinion and I'm not trying to degrade the film in anyway. It's good to learn from other films in order to make your film better. That's how films get better and better for the future generation.  Anyway, just watch it.

            "content": "SPOILER AT END OF COMMENTSI recently got the opportunity to see this film on the big screen, for the first time, at the Hong Kong Intl. Film Festival 2004. As a westerner I have lived in Hong Kong for over 3 years and always previously imagined the standard Hong Kong film genre to be either a comedy/historical-comedy/gangster/police style of film. How wrong I have been! This film was absolutely stunning from it's opening scene to it's eventual conclusion.I found the cinematography/direction/props/locations/sets/costumes/make-up/acting/music to be of the highest quality and detail. As a lover of french historic dramas, and the work of Mr Jean-Paul Rappenneau, I feel this equals and at times exceeds his Cyrano de Bergerac in quality and stature. Which I rate as my favourite film.As stated by other users here, Leslie Cheung has his character so well sorted. His opposite number Fengyi Zhang does very well to keep up with such a brilliant performance by Cheung. Although Zhang is equally well supported by actress Li Gong who plays his wife Juxian, with some wonderful repartie between herself and Cheung trying to outwit each other.It was also interesting to see this film after having read Jackie Chans' biography, describing his upbringing at a chinese opera school in Hong Kong, in the 60's. The comparisons between his experiences and those portrayed in this film were very similar.I can easily say that this film ranks extremely high in my opinion. Anyone wanting to see what is surely one of the best chinese films ever produced should see this film.Rating 10/10\nSPOILER AHEAD\nThe most touching scene of the film, apart from the obvious one that I won't mention here, is the scene where the fellow escapee boy from the opera school, realises his dream of fame in a devastatingly macabre way. Having dreamt of being a famous opera star, earning lots of money and eating candied crab apples every day. When he becomes aware that a beating of almighty proportions is about to follow, he stuffs his mouth with all his 'ill gotten' apples and so decides to end it all. As the rest of the school discover the scene, the schools stage falls out on to the floor with a crash, signifying the boys last and ultimate performance. A real lump in the throat moment.",

The beautiful photography and the perfect control of the time and the sequence of scenes for part of the director. Nothing is left, nothing is missing. The almost 3 hours what does this last, I almost didn't felt them. 2. The script work. Beautiful dialogues, natural link between one scene and another, and a very credible story. In no one part I thought \"this is not possible\". A very important achievement for a very ambitious movie like this. 3. The interpretations was magisterial, specially Leslie Cheung (Daoyi) and Gong Li (Juxian). All the time I felt I was looking the characters and I never saw the actor behind them. 4. The movie no only was about the opera, was a kind of opera. I'm a little familiar with the Chinese aesthetic, and this movie remember me the classic literature and the Beijing Opera progression. At the end the film become more symbolic and emotional, just like the climax of the classical Chinese works. This movie capture the Chinese soul, so we don't need to put names like \"shakespearean\" or make the reference of any other western artist, because the principal inspiration for this movie, in my point of view, is deeply Chinese. This movie is the Taoist ductility of the Chinese art, who are in constantly change and mutation.Anyone who loves the cinema, the history or the high art must see this movie.",

Any picture in the movie is almost perfect, and all the characters in the movie are fresh. And it's all like a dream, a dream, but it's as real. Two actors of Peking Opera, half a century, have gone through a historical transit in China, which is the backbone of this movie drama. And its branches are the deep-rooted traditional culture of our country, the state of human existence, the thought of human nature.In this stage of history, two actors of Peking Opera crossed the history they could not bear, from the late Qing Dynasty to the new China, one died in the drama of choice, the other lived in reality. The film is like an old dream, intermittent and unforgettable. It is a classic work, its story, its actors, its lines, its inside information and so on are impeccable. It is a classic that can't be surpassed. It is based on a turning point in the history of Chinese film and becomes a symbol of the history of Chinese film. If it is a dream of human nature?

Some of early productions by Chen and zhang, two most influential Chinese directors at this point, are a bit too artistic in my opinion.However, this movie is very balanced. Storyline, directing, cinematography, dialog design, acting, all of those are almost immaculate. For foreign watchers, it is better that you know a bit of Chinese contemporary history such as Janpanese invasion, cultural revolution, and so on to really understand the background and better know the development of plot and characterization. If you know nothing about China or Chinese history, this is still a fantastic movie, but you will miss a lot of subtle details.The movie is about a life of a Chinese opera actor, or you can say a group of them. In the backdrop, you can witness all the big events in Chinese contemporary history. The good thing is the director wants to let all those political and social environment play in, which is essential to the character development, but the director doesn't explicitly depict all those events.",

This movie is confusing but easy to analyze if paying a lot of attention to detail. For example the shadow of burning candle on Xiaolou Juxian photo. That is why every scene is very interesting to watch. To be honest, Chinese movie today is terrible which it so surprising to find this movie so great. If only China stop censoring everything they would beat Hollywood already because China has lot of talented filmmakers. And plus point is Leslie. He is so gorgeous in make up that his beauty defeats Juxian (Gong Li is much manlier that the rest of male character though) and make everyone in gay. Minus point is propaganda.

We can see many touching pictures: Xiaolou was punished, he kneeled in the yard in the dark night and winter, and Dieyi looked at him distressedly through the window, and when he came back, he was naked, but gave the quilt to the Xiaolou Wrap up. Then it must be hard to forget the scene where they snuggled up and slept together. Dieyi hugged the small building tightly, as if afraid of losing him. And Xiaolou also loved Dieyi deeply. He began to know that Dieyi didn't want to learn Beijing Opera. At that time, he let Dieyi away, even though he was very reluctant. Later, I asked the boss to come and listen to Die Yi's bad singing \"I was a girl\", so I used a pipe to iron him, so that Die Yi sang for the first time.\nUndoubtedly, they all like each other, but Xiaolou's affection for Dieyi is just like that of a good brother, and Dieyi's affection for Xiaolou is beyond kinship. Because he always plays Tsing Yi in the play and sings female accents, he learns female form, and over time, in society and roles, he is more inclined to females. For Xiao Lou, he has always been a female character, such as helping Xiao Lou lick the wound and painting Xiao Lou's face. His intimate movements all reflect his extraordinary feelings for Xiao Lou. Especially after the appearance of Juxian, his jealousy and resentment towards Xiaolou obviously realized the feminine characteristics of his social role.Cheng Dieyi and Xiaoxizi\nXiaoxizi's deepest impression on Dieyi was nothing more than a sentence: \"I will eat sugar gourd every day when I become a horn\" and a scene \"Finally, I hanged myself because I was afraid of being beaten by the master.\" His suicide was Prepared, because of watching the horrible scene of Die Yi being beaten, maybe he is afraid because he feels that he has to be hit by a lot of pain when he becomes a horn? In short, he was prepared to commit suicide. Before he died, he swallowed all the food he hurriedly. This may be another option for many people who study Beijing opera but do not have an angle. Dreams cannot come true, only to find in the world of nothingness.\nBut he left Die Yi with the impression of a lifetime. After Die Yi became a horn, he was stunned when he heard the cry of the rock sugar gourd before entering. At that time, what did he think of? Little skinny's dream? The death of the little skinny? Perhaps it is shocked and helpless?Cheng Dieyi and Duke Zhang\nDuke Zhang stained the butterfly clothing. Being a horn is not necessarily just honor and joy. They may not yet know that it was just desperately moving forward at first, but later they reached the goal, only to find that the result might not be good, but they could only accept it and not change it.\nIronically, on the eve of the founding of New China, the eunuch, Duke Zhang, who wanted to do whatever he wanted, became a poor old man who bought cigarettes, and he had lost his mind and knew only the people who sold cigarettes. Has everything he ever done been forgotten in his chaos? But the injured person is irreparable pain in his life. Between people in society, one thing may be trivial for one person, and when it may be decisive for another person.Cheng Dieyi and Ju Xian (mother)\nFrom the beginning, Dieyi was full of hostility and jealousy towards Juxian, because she snatched Xiaolou, the most important person in Dieyi's life. There may be a battle between them, and Die Yi is destined to be a loser.\nHowever, in a scene where Dieyi and Juxian face each other, he has a certain attachment to Dieyi, which is a kind of attachment to his mother. Especially when he was addicted to drugs, Ju Xian held him and coaxed him to sleep more clearly. Dieyi was sent to Beijing opera class by her mother from an early age. Even her mother's last glance, the empty door without a figure, was not seen. Therefore he is eager for maternal love. In addition, Ju Xian and Die Yi's mother are all prostitutes. They are also prostitutes. They also give him an illusion. Ju Xian has many characteristics of his mother, female, spicy, and prostitute.\nTherefore, his feelings for Juxian were very contradictory, wandering in hostility and attachment.",

This art-house film, like many of the genre, had excellent characters. The characters were well defined, unique, and surprising.I highly recommend this film. It reminded me a lot of Raising the Red Lantern. Both beautiful films, but extremely sad as well. If you're interested in costumes or sets you should definitely check out Farewell My Concubine.",

            "review_title": "Opera and the Narcissism of Master Yuan",
            "content": "Most genuine is the parallel between opera and life. This is not alien to Chinese people but people in other culture are not familiar with this concept. Chinese people deem our life in other way is an opera and everyone has his own role. Tears, laughter, sorrow, anger, despair are the various emotions in the opera and the various experiences in life. Most important this concept is associated with the emptiness of life. Everything would be gone, just like an opera would end somehow. Despite the emptiness opera is so beautiful and stands for the delicacy and refinement of art. In the film Dieyi and Yuan performs their desperate love towards Opera, indicating their pursuit for the true, the good and the beautiful. Dieyi is a pure man pursuing his ideal both in art and in the real world. Yuan is not as perfect. He is a sophisticated speculator, and has struggled for wealth and fame for his whole life. But he is so obsessed with opera for it is perfect beauty. Dieyi is the incarnation of the beauty which he is dying for. In his pursuing for, protecting, and admiring Dieyi in spite of the others' disliking him and misunderstanding, we see respectable humanness.First time he saw Dieyi he can sense that he is not welcomed. But as a gentleman he expressed his admiration and then left. His directness and decisiveness shows his confidence as well, with a clear mind that he has something else what would win Dieyi's heart, other than money.His argument with Xiaolou on the opera performance shows his insist on art, independent thinking, and his knowledge in opera, and is a foreshadowing for his own competition with Xiaolou. Xiaolou got married and Dieyi was not happy and desperate. Yuan came comforting Dieyi and took him away. Or we say this time Dieyi followed him. He fulfilled his dream to perform the opera together with Dieyi although without any spectator. In his house Dieyi saw the sword and Yuan gives it away unconditionally. He knows Dieyi would leave anyway with the sword, but he never complains, but just gives what he has, to help fulfill Dieyi's dream.Later when Dieyi performed on stage he was interrupted by anti-Japanese leaflet. But Dieyi insisted to complete the performance. In the darkness only Yuan was watching. He really understands what Dieyi insists on, that is the independence of art in spite of any political or racial view. When Dieyi was on trial for betraying his country, it is Yuan that help secure Dieyi. He asks for nothing in return but wants to argue with Xiaolou for the previous performance issue. This is the first time he tries to prove others his pursuit for art. Before that he only did this with Dieyi. We can say he compels Xiaolou, or is willful. He loves Dieyi but doesn't want to occupy him. He lets Dieyi free and is there to protect him. This is unselfish and unconditional, and is different from the romantic love. Or we can say, the love for Dieyi is also his love for the purity of life and the beauty. He saw a Dieyi that lives out his beliefs and values, to some extent Dieyi is another Yuan in Yuan's eyes, standing for the part of Yuan that is free to pursue love and beauty.

He saw a Dieyi that lives out his beliefs and values, to some extent Dieyi is another Yuan in Yuan's eyes, standing for the part of Yuan that is free to pursue love and beauty. Yuan was executed in the end. Before he died he defends the opera art at a price of his life. He can die without pity, for he finally carries out his value. He never is able to perform on the stage, for he can't be a pure artist, but the execution of him brings him onto the stage, on the last day of his life. How ridiculous this is. The world has become insane. Yuan knows it pretty well and stepped onto the stage with ease. Yuan was executed in the end. Before he died he defends the opera art at a price of his life.

As a movie that has a story line flowing with the stream of history, it is better that Huo Zhe, the highest rated Chinese Movie to date, in an artistic sense. May be because the protagonist, a true artist, is much more sensitive, idealistic and paranoid, thus giving the movie more color and vigor. The story of Huo Zhe on the other hand, is applicable to the majority of Chinese, the ones that do not fight back. Also this is a masterpiece where not even one line or one scene is abundant.This is not a movie to be missed. The story telling is friendly to those who have a limited knowledge of Chinese history.",

One of the reasons why I saw it so many times is that I translated its dialogs from Chinese into Italian for its dubbing. Nearly all movies are dubbed in Italy. The language spoken by the old people was quite formal, while children were more colloquial and, sometimes, vulgar. There also were passages reminiscent of historical events and literary quotations.What impressed me from the very beginning was the fast rhythm of the whole movie, quite different from that of nearly all the Chinese movies I saw in the past. 'Red Lanterns', the great movie by by Zhang Yimou, is entirely different, just to quote one.The sung parts were clearly performed by non professional Peking Opera actors, but they were essential to the narration itself and not many people may have realized it.Actors and the actress, Gong Li, are excellent.The movie is a remarkable portrait of the Chinese society during a few crucial decades: a masterpiece!",

The downfall of dynastic China is put into parallel with the defeat of Xiang Yu a.k.a the Hegemon-King of Western Chu. The Cultural Revolution is brutally displayed in an honest way - as a relentless orgy of violence, gaslighting, and destruction, taken up by desperate people in an attempt to escape positions of coercion. The result of this effort is an interrogation of character in which both the targeted master and his innocent coerced subservient are assumed to be bourgeoise elements. The master dies right away, or like Napoleon on Corsica, he lives as though he were dead, while the servant's death is explosive, confusing, and tragic.\nThis is one of the reasons this film is a masterpiece. Both sides are displayed. There is a brutal contradiction between the reign of the King of Chu and the needs of the people, which would eventually lead to the founding of Han, just as there was genuine contradiction between the classes in conflict during the Cultural Revolution. The result of this contradiction, the conclusion of the play and the movie, is genuine tragedy - innocence itself is lost to this irresolvable deadlock, while history necessarily presses onwards.",

The description of Beijing Opera in the film is very vivid. It made me feel the unique beauty of Beijing Opera. Chen Kaige gave the best performance of his directing career in this production.Mr. Leslie Cheung's performance was particularly impressive. Unfortunately, Mr. Leslie Cheung passed away on April 1, 2003. He's one of the most charming Asian actors I've ever met. This film has made me miss him even more.But I think the translation of this movie is terrible and it's a little confusing in one respect. I think it has something to do with the film being cut.",

The affection between Cheung's Douzi and Fengyi's Shitou just doesn't feel convincing enough to carry a film of this kind of ambition; when crises occur and betrayals take place, they seldom carry much in the way of weight (or consequences), robbing the audience of direct involvement. Instead, the film's plot comes off much more melodramatic than it should, becoming more of a checklist of 20th-century Chinese history told through a love triangle and catty dialogue than a deeply affecting drama, despite strong performances from the leads.\n\nStill, it remains ambitious and took genuinely daring leaps with both its incorporation of homosexuality into traditionally conservative Chinese society, and its gruesome depiction of the Cultural Revolution, and deserves credit for each. Plus, it does look pretty darn good. (3/5)",

It is a beautifully shot, sweeping epic with magnetic performances from Leslie Chung, Zhang Fengyi and Gong Li. Unfortunately, it's strengths are also its weakness. While the scenes of the Beijing Opera are spectacular and the relationships between the leads engaging, the film has bitten off a bit more than it can chew. Set over a period of almost half a century, there is just too much ground to cover, even with a generous runtime. The extensive time period covered is further complicated by the fact that the 20th century was such a complex time in Chinese history, with ever shifting political and social changes. As a result, for those who are not already familiar with early 20th century China, much of the film becomes muddled as it jumps from decade to decade. Even for those who are familiar with the underlying context can at times experience a bit of whiplash as the film jumps forward in leaps and bounds, drawing out the small intimate moments and jumping over big events that would set the stage for the film's commentary. It is in these small moments that Farewell My Concubine cements itself as a spectacular work, worthy of every ounce of praise it has recieved. Unfortunately, it seems a little to he'll bent on leaving nothing out, which means the emotional core of the film gets buried under thw burocratic nonsense.",

            "content": "An intriguing tale, with a fascinating chunk of modern Chinese history serving as the background. Spanning over 50 years, the film tells about the ups and downs of a traditional Peking Opera troupe, and its two stars, from 1924 to 1977. Not only do we see the various political events of the time, but also how the traditional opera and its stars are treated during different eras.\n\nThe two stars, Dieyi and Xiaolou, are brought up and trained to play specific roles - that of concubine and king respectively - in a famous play. Dieyi (Douzi) is trained, or should I say, forced to behave, sing, move and dance like a girl, from a very young age. The two of them share a unique and close bond, and this balance gets affected when a woman, Juxian, enters the picture. Their political naivet\u00e9 get them into many problems, but it's their properly unresolved love triangle that causes more trouble.\n\nThe lines between fact and fiction are blurred when we realise the similarities between the play and their actual lives. Dieyi's devotion to opera and Xiaolou are as strong as the concubine's devotion to the king. (The lines are blurred even more when Leslie Cheung, bisexual himself, takes his life in 2003) The end is inevitable, as we realise while the story progresses, but it's reached with proper momentum and after an intriguing chain of events.\n\nThe acting by the three leads is really terrific. Leslie Cheung as the female-role playing opera star who's completely devoted to his art, Fengyi Zhang as a talented and playful man who can easily separate his private and work lives, and Gong Li as the prostitute-turned-wife whose shades of determination and compassion keeps us from not having a fixed view of her character. With Chen Kaige's talented direction and Gu Changwei's spectacular cinematography, the movie has many colourful and memorable scenes.\n\nI really liked the movie, and wasn't bored for a single second. The movie deals with so many interesting themes - Modern Chinese history, sexuality, art and its reception, devotion and passion - but yet it somehow makes me feel that it had the potential to be much more compelling. Other than the political events, the characters could have been explored a little more.",

But because their love story is so deeply rooted into China's political history throughout the 1900s, I felt like I wasn't able to fully appreciate the movie the way it should be appreciated... Idk. Perhaps if I was older - or just more educated and less ignorant - and understood the significance of each of the events that happened in the movie, I would have enjoyed this film more. But, that said, all three actors did a friggin' amazing job. Leslie Cheung was brilliant. His character just goes through the story so painfully, his ending was long called for. But yeah. Beautiful story etc., but I couldn't relate to the plot. Oh, and it was really effing long, Jesus.",

            "content": "Farewell my Concubine is undoubtedly one of the greatest movies ever made. It spans throught 5 decades of chinese history, and follows one of the most interesting characters I've ever seen. It's costumes are spectacular and the cinematography is brilliant. What makes this one of the greatest movies ever made is the acting. For me, there were no actors in this movie, only the characters. It is a class of acting that you seldom see in Western cinema. If you won't watch the film on the heart-wrenching story alone, then watch it for one of the greatest performances of all time by Leslie Cheung. \n\nThis is the story of two men, Douzi (Leslie Cheung) and Shitou (Fengyi Zhang), who met as apprentices in the Peking Opera, and remained in contact for over 50 years. Both of them grew up to star in the opera 'Farewell My Concubine,' where Douzi played the Concubine and Shitou played the King of Chu.\n\nOver the years we see the era of the Warlords (1920s), the Japanese invasion (mid 1940s), the retaking of China by the nationalists (late 1940s), and then the communist era of Mao Zedong. This epic story spans all the way to 1977, and not once does the excitement or attachment to the story falter.\n \nLeslie Cheung truly embodied this character and brought it to life. It was all in his eyes, every emotion that you could imagine. The anger, frustration, terror, love, and heartbreak all came across plainly on his face. There hasn't been a performance that moved me this much in a long time. From losing the man he loves to overcoming an opium addiction, every single movement, word, and expression was perfect.\n \nLi Gong also gave a breathtaking performance as a former prostitute and the wife of Shitou. Honestly, there is nothing this woman can't do. She's able to display such strength, and such fragility, all wrapped up into one character. Together, Gong and Cheung have brilliant chemistry as two 'women' who want the same man. \n\nThere is plenty of brutality in this film, mixed with plenty of tenderness. It's not completely tragic, for there is a lot of hope in these characters. You cannot describe this film with a genre or a word. It's more than a period drama, or a romance, or a tragedy.\n \nThese characters are interesting enough from a psychological perspective alone. If there's one thing I love Farewell My Concubine, it's that it begs you to discuss it afterwards. It leaves you to connect the dots when it comes to motives, feelings, and symbolism.\n \nI was thrilled from start to finish with this masterful film. It truly is one of the greatest movies ever made. Schindler's List may have won Best Picture at the Academy Awards during the same year, but for me this is a film worthy of that title. There's nothing I could fault about Farewell My Concubine. I recommend this movie to anyone who is interested in history and psychology.",
