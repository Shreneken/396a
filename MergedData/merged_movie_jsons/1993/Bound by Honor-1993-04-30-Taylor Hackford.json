            "review_title": "Barrio Epic",
            "content": "Based on the real life experiences of poet Jimmy Santiago Baca, Bound By Honor covers two decades in the latter half of the 20th century as seen through the eyes of half brothers Benjamin Bratt and Jesse Borrego and their cousin Damian Chapa. Growing up more or less together, all three start out as gang bangers, but each has a different destiny and in many ways one's destiny is caused by the actions of the others.Borrego gets injured in a gang retaliation and works hard to not become a cripple. He does however become both a painter of note and a drug addict of considerable appetite. A tragedy there sets him and Bratt apart.Bratt also winds up in a feud with Chapa. When both were young gang bangers and looking to retaliate for Borrego, Bratt and Chapa are arrested. Because this was Bratt's first offense he got a choice of the military or jail time and he chose the Marines. Chapa however was sent to prison, to San Quentin to be precise where he joined the Chicano prison gang La Onda. Pretty soon Chapa is high in the gang councils and deep in the politics of the prison. Bratt in the meantime joins the LAPD and destiny makes these two collide.Bound By Honor has an epic quality almost a kind of Chicano Gone With The Wind. The mostly Hispanic cast do a great job in depicting life in the Barrio. The film runs just about three hours and it's a tribute to director Taylor Hackford that your interest doesn't flag for a minute.Hackford also creates many interesting supporting characters two numerous to mention, always the mark of a good film. But your interest is always in the three leads. You get to care about what is to become of them, what destiny has in store.There are certain similarities between Bound By Honor and the Edward James Olmos film, American Me. Personally I give a slight edge to this one, don't miss it if it is broadcast.",

            "content": "I first saw this film a few years ago when my brother stumbled across it in a bargain basement basket bin! What a travesty for a start that it had not made a bigger mark at the box office and had been consigned to a cheap basket! I'm sure if released with more fanfare this time it would reach the audience it deserves! It is a story of rival gangs, family, love, betrayal, loyalty, acceptance - every film clich\u00e9 you could think of.It thoroughly explores the destiny of its 3 young stars as they struggle to make their way with the life path they have taken. I won't give away the plot as I believe anyway who truly loves films should see this film in its full glory with no knowledge of the plot or how the film eventually plays out.I have been reading the postings, and many negative comments have been made about this film, but I believe this film stands up to much of its unfair criticism.I will admit though, that I did squirm at some of Miklo's earlier expressions in the film, but a 3/4 of the way through he really picks up the baton and completely takes over. In fact, he is a revelation.There are some cheesy bits of dialogue, but I don't think this takes away from the piece in any way.It is a long film, but it needed to be. I don't think there are ANY scenes they could have done without - it is very effective, just the way it is.Anybody who has seen it and didn't like it first time round, I employ you to rent it/buy it again and give it another try.I purchased another copy of it again just a few days ago. I watched it yesterday and was still moved - as if it was the first time I saw it.Its definitely TOP TEN best film material! MUST SEE!",

Some viewers complain that this an American Me rip off and its way too long, yes there are similarities but it is told in a different manner, I thought the 190 minutes(Directors cut) flew by.

            "review_title": "Surprisingly deep",
            "content": "At first glance one feels this is a TV movie, starting with a sunny day somewhere in east LA and a guy coming in and greeting anyone in Spanish, with colorful Mexicans all over. You may think, based on the movie title as well, that it will be one of those gang action movies where the hero beats up everybody. It certainly starts that way, but the movie is not like that.After a while, when the plot expands a little more, you find that the white dude that comes to greet his \"Chicano\" friends is a halfbreed American Mexican who hates his white father and considers himself \"brown on the inside\". He is also on parole and only days until he gets to be 18 and be totally free. Then he makes a stupid move. Now you think it is going to be one of those prison movies, with the misguided youth and the corrupt system. Perhaps he is going to go to prison and beat up everybody. That ain't it, either.It takes maybe a little to see that the movie isn't even close to being over so you look to the length of the film. It's 3 hours long! The fact that it starts showing the year in which things happen gives the final clue: it is an epic story. The complexity of the characters hint at a book or something like that and, indeed, the story is written by poet Jimmy Santiago Baca, based on his personal experience. It's almost a biopic.And look at the cast! Damian Chapa is pretty known, but also Benjamin Bratt, Delroy Lindo, Victor Rivers (can't have a movie about Mexicans without Rivers - I really think he should have gotten more main roles), Billy Bob Thornton, Ving Rhames, Danny Trejo and even Jimmy Santiago Baca himself as \"Gato\", who I don't really remember.About the movie itself, its main strength is the characters. Each of the lead characters is being carefully sketched and then transformed by the story. The ending, most of all, explains the feelings and reality of the people involved. There were criticisms that the movie was overacted sometimes. Perhaps, but most of it was actually in character. Miklo is someone who is desperately, so desperately, trying to belong. Of course he overacts. His whole character is made up in his head.So, as a conclusion to this too long review: this is not a masterpiece, but it is a movie about the truth of people in those times, and it is well done. Truthful films are more and more scarce as the time goes by. If you find the time and mood to watch this white Mexican biopic, I don't think you will be disappointed.",

            "content": "I've seen this movie a couple of times and its got its good points and its bad.  It's an interesting story, though generally, it perpetuates the \"East L.A. gang member\" stereotype.  However, it also addresses something I haven't seen before in a movie of this type, and something that was perfectly illustrated (unintentionally) by some of the unfavorable reviews posted here.  I'm referring to the character of Miklos, and how stereotypes within his own community about \"what is Latin\" contribute to the person he becomes.  There have been a few reviewers here who feel that the character of Miklos was not believable as Latino, as he was \"too\" white looking.  As I understand, that was exactly the point.  He was always having to prove himself as 'more latin than thou' because of his fair skin.  Somehow being 'more latin than thou' became akin to being a hardest of the hard gang member. I think that was the most compelling idea out of the movie because that sort of thing happens quite often.  Many Latinos subscribe to the stereotype that \"all latinos are a sort of medium brown\".  Forgetting that \"Latino\" is not a race.  It refers to ethnicity.  You can be of any race and still be Latino. Those who don't fit into the stereotype of appearance sometimes try to find another way to 'be more Latin', and become susceptible to other, more insidious stereotypes. I've known my fair share of blue eyed blond \"Miklos\" who felt compelled to prove their \"Latin-ness\" by being a thug. So despite what has to be a record usage of the word \"ese\", I found this movie a worthy viewing due to the addressing of this topic.",

            "content": "Bound By Honor (BBH) is not meant to legitimize or glorify gang life, or ennoble Latino culture. It simply tells a story that faithfully paraphrases harsh reality. If you don't get the story, then it's easy to lambaste the acting and directing. If you do get the story, then the acting and directing are good enough.Many of the film's characters are people we know: Cruz, full of verve and potential, a victim of the needle; his father, a working class Chicano who wanted better for his sons; Miklo, the fresh-faced well-intentioned misfit driven inexorably to a life of brutality; Paco, the handsome athlete rescued from ruin by the Marine Corp; Juanito, the \"mocoso\" of the family, whom everybody wanted to protect from the perils of the barrio, tragically cut down nonetheless; Miklo's mom, a party girl ill-prepared to be a mother; Miklo's aunt - strong and responsible - called on to be a mother to her sister's son.The prison scenes and subplot are quite visceral. Some people find them laughable or unbelievable, but I find them to be neither. Some liberties were taken, but for the most part, I thought prison gangs, corruption, killings, rape, parole boards, and trade were depicted quite well.There are also universal themes: The meanings of home and family; hard but honest work versus a life of crime; the fickle consequences of youthful foolishness, striking down some while letting others pass; unfulfilled hopes, and other hopes fulfilled in unexpected ways; a family torn apart by tragedy with only time to heal the wound; the struggle to right one's ship; generational gaps bridged only by maturity that comes in the wake of mistakes; the constant questioning of oneself.It would have been nice to see more character development of women in the family, and some of the actors should have worked on their accents and delivery a little more. Still, I highly recommend this film to anybody in search of a story like the one it tells. To those who don't feel particularly strongly about the material covered, I'd say BBH is no worse than almost any recent big budget film. But to those inclined to greet the *underlying story* with folded arms and a dismissive grin or snort, I'd say spend your three hours watching something else. My verdict: 9 of 10 stars.Now I'll address some points raised by those who say the film is garbage.1) \"It was too long.\" It was long, yes, but there's very little I'd have left on the editing room floor. I think if one finds the subject material interesting, then the film moves along nicely, despite its length. Also, I think it's hilarious that so many people who despise the film actually watched the whole darn thing! Any flick that keeps you watching for 3 hours can't be too bad.2) \"Damian Chapa is too white to play a Latino.\" First, people who say this misunderstand what it means to be Latino, and second, they miss an important subplot. Chapa is a *Spanish* surname, and if Damian Chapa is Latino, then by definition, he's not too white to play one. Latinos of mixed ethnicity are not some Hollywood phantasm, and the treatment of mixed ethnicity and Americanization is a recurring theme in Latino culture in the USA. In the film, Chapa's character is of mixed ethnicity, and as such constantly has to prove he is \"Raza\" in a way that his peers never do. This constant challenge to his identity makes him fearless and quick to the draw, lest those whose approval he seeks question the make of his blood. For example, that's why *he* is the one to first confront Tres Puntos, not his fellow Vatos Locos. In a culture where fair hair, skin, and eyes are at times a liability, he proved his worth by the only measure his peers valued.3) \"The acting was over the top.\" Some of the acting that seems over the top is actually not. Gang members quickly learn to communicate by force of will. Also, they are not generally educated or refined, and in their own parlance, one word can mean many things. So the frequent displays of machismo are not necessarily bad acting, and hearing \"ese\" and \"carnal\" repeated over and over is not necessarily bad directing, and the convicts' corny one-liners are not meant to be the witty banter of NPR... but yeah, the film could have been toned down a little in some places.4) \"It wasn't true to the time period.\" Critics said the same thing about Doctor Zhivago, but a good film transcends that, and I believe BBH does. The film covered from ~1970 to ~1985, and I had no problem with the settings. Whatever time period mistakes were made weren't bad enough to distract me from the film.5) \"BBH is a cheap rip-off of American Me (AM).\" I saw BBH before I saw AM, so I wasn't predisposed to dismiss BBH as a knockoff. I think AM is depressing and clinical, whereas BBH is uplifting and colorful. Both films cover the same reality and so of course will overlap at points. The same can be said of films about the Vietnam War or the Old West, except that because there are relatively few films about Latinos, the comparison of these two is inevitable. AM is more polished, but BBH is more riveting, probably because BBH makes you care about its characters more. If AM is a sad docudrama with all the loose ends tied up, then BBH is an emotional roller coaster with many questions unanswerable and others simply left unanswered.",

It is long, I'll grant the complaints about that, but one of the beauties of video is you don't have to watch it all at one time.  Over-acted?  I think that has to do with the genre.  Okay, it isn't the best movie ever made.  But I can sum up all of its shortcomings with one contraticting word.  It is compelling.  I can very much relate to the reviewer who mentioned getting hooked on it on tv in the middle of the night.  It is a compelling movie in spite of its shortcomings.

            "review_title": "criminally underrated film",
            "content": "This film really is a peer of The Godfather. It should be thought of in those terms. Both films track members of a family who are in mob-like organizations. \"Blood In, Blood Out\" tracks the fate of family members involved in gangs but some of whom try to go straight, while The Godfather is more concerned with the internal machinations of the criminal organization.That said, the films tracks several boys who during their youth are parts of illegal criminal families. I think this film is criminally underrated. Both the first and second Godfather films deserve their plaudits and the performances, direction, and script combined to make for compelling inter-generational dramas. However, this film is no different. It does not track such a lengthy period of time, but we see significant character development, multi-layered story lines, and large numbers of peripheral characters who also play important parts in the film.The acting in this film is brilliant from the three leads Benjamin Bratt, Jesse Borrego, and most notably, Damian Chapa. Chapa as Miclo is the light-skinned, blue-eyed Latino whose appearance has always driven him to prove how loyal a Latino he was and which leads him into a lot of trouble. Chapa's performance depicts Miclo as scared and unsure as a youngster, but as he grows older, he becomes more sure of himself and more committed to his lifestyle. Chapa delivers an intense, energetic performance which really should have led to more opportunities for him, had he wanted them. Jesse Borrego as Cruz is a talented artist whose life falls prey to drugs but who survives and doesn't forget his origins and values. Borrego make Cruz an imp with a twinkle in his eye which never goes out, no matter how far he falls and Borrego's performance also shows a great deal of depth. Bratt is Paco, perhaps the most troubled as a youngster, but whose life changes fortuitously before it can spin too far out of control. The three leads are cousins, and their courses in life converge and diverge in interesting and not unrealistic ways.There is great supporting work from actors like Delroy Lindo, Enrique Castillo, Carlos Carrasco, Victor Rivers, and many others. The script and screenplay are fantastic, chronicling about 13 or 14 years with great ease but without sacrificing complexity. The story is based on the experiences of artist Jimmy Santiago Baca and he helped to write the screenplay.For me, the relationships among the races in prison is the most fascinating part of the film. Race defines one's position in prison. The unity of the members of a race will determine how powerful that race is in prison. This is not a film for kids. The violence is not soft-pedaled. It is brutal and unapologetic. Director Taylor Hackford should be applauded for not shrinking from a not particularly feelgood story. He allows the film to breathe and allows the tragedy and triumph to play out. I have read some reviewers critique the length of this film and while I sympathize, I don't know which parts they would remove. I don't find that the film drags at all and the relationships within the family, within racial groups, and between racial groups, make this a film that will withstand repeated viewing.",

If you wanted sex in prison, you had plenty of willing partners and it just might be a very difficult and hard way to deal with it, or just simply getting raped when you least expect it. A young guy gets out of jail and tries to go down the straight and narrow path and winds up losing a body part and is constantly trying to become a gang member. There is a guy who has a great ability of being an artist, drawing great paintings and he gets cut up and his back twisted like a pretzel.

I find that the real depth of the story is far beyond just that. This is a movie about acceptance, the need to fit in, the struggles of belonging to a minority, prison gangs, pride, family and the way different people get shaped with time and circumstance. When you start this movie, you can not imagine how far it will go and how the different characters evolve and the acting is great, all the actors picked fit perfectly their roles.There is so much in this movie that I wont go into details, but to briefly explain, the story revolves around three cousins who are all completely different but bound by blood. They all seem to be going on a certain path which becomes radically changed early in the movie when their paths diverge dramatically. Its along these paths that you get a glimpse of society at those times, of hardships, of unfair circumstances and of survival.This is really a great movie, one of my all time favourites. I have watched it probably more than 10 times and will continue to watch it again and again. Enjoy! 9/10",

The bread and butter of this movie is the prison story line and the character of Miklo (I still have a Latina friend who sometimes calls me that name in jest, because I may be white on the outside, but I'm brown on the inside - TO THE BONE!)I must have watched this movie at least a half dozen times, and writing this review makes me want to watch it again.",

You get a tale of friendship, coming of age, gang initiation, prison drama, drug dealing, and even Sun Tzu's art of war going on throughout.  I was mesmerized as a young man watching this and just like little Juanito couldn't resist the temptation to be like the older boys I couldn't resist either.  Nothing like a little ambition and a bunch of drugs, crime and violence to get the juices flowing.I wonder if the people who hate on the movie ever tasted a little bit of the life portrayed in the movie.  Yes, people live with poverty and joblessness as well as get incarcerated, involved in gangs, drug dealing and addiction. Some of the hardest thugs do end up becoming soldiers and cops.Street slang sounds just like the dialog in the movie.  Loud, in your face and to the point with much attitude and machismo behind it.  As such the cliches don't bother me and they are very effective in getting the message accross.  The tribal brotherhood in the movie was very intoxicating since I was steeped in it as a young man and still carry that inside.  Maybe some viewers are not used to the Mexican perspective and would be more comfortable if the whites and the blacks were not so marginalized but it's usually the other way around in so many films so why not try a different perspective.As far as the acting goes I think everyone was having fun playing angry, powertripping badasses so I was having fun right along with all three main characters and the rest of the supporting cast.

            "content": "Spanish versus blacks versus white supremacists in a 1970-1980's melting prison pot just ready to boil over. Three young men living in a working class east L.A. neighborhood defined by the many gang- banger's who want to build their reputation for being the biggest bad asses are ready to rumble and look for any excuse to get it on next to their \"homies\".The three main characters are aspiring artist, lover and drug addicted Cruz (Jesse Borrego), ex-boxer turned law enforcement officer Paco (Benjamin Bratt) and angry mixed breed Spanish/White Miklo (Damian Chapa) who grow up together in a gang but as life takes its course over two decades these three men fight their own demons alone and sometimes pitted against one another.If you want to fight the bull sometimes you get the horn and Miklo who is struggling to gain acceptance of his mothers Spanish heritage because his skin color is white is constantly fighting the race card on all three sides of the Spanish, white and black prison gangs. Miklo is the one of the three young men who ends up in prison and must gain the trust of his Spanish prison gang members if he is going to survive his years in imprisonment. Although Damian Chapa's acting as his character Miklo was exceedingly over emphasized as an angry \"Chico\" we just never see a two dimensional character. On the brighter side the two other main characters Cruz (artist) and Paco (cop) evolve into men with a conscience and so they periodically reflect back on their younger gang war years as a brotherhood that must be respected but also realizing it was in their past and not in their future.There are some other great supporting cast members such as Raymond Cruz as Chuey the druggie, Victor Rivers as Spanish prisoner Magic Mike, Danny Trejo as Spanish prisoner Geronimo, Carlos Carrasco as Spanish prisoner Popeye, Ving Rhames as a prison gang intelligence detective named Ivan, Delroy Lindo as Bonafide the leader of the black prison gang, Tom Towles as white supremacist Red Ryder, and Billy Bob Thornton as white supremacist Lightning. As you can see by this depth of the talent pool most of whom went on to greater Hollywood fame, the director Taylor Hackford utilized his young talent pool to his full advantage and to the viewers greatest benefit.This film is a tad over 3 hours long, but surprisingly, there are no dead spots throughout the film. The intertwined stories of the 3 Spanish homies Cruz, Paco and Miklo are blended so well that we the viewer can only anticipate what is going to happen next, and to our surprise everything is not as it seems in their Spanish neighborhood, nor in the prison where Miklo grows into a hardened lifetime criminal battling the blacks and Aryan racists proving himself over and over to favor his Spanish heritage gang members.It took me 23 years to finally watch this film but I believe that Blood In, Blood Out has withstood the test of time and the storyline is still relative today as it was three decades ago when it was released in the early 1990's. So many great male stars went on to have great movie careers and this film could only have helped build their film resumes with such strong personal acting performances in a tough gang related film such as Blood In, Blood Out. I give the film an 8 out of 10 rating",

Even if we needed another prison gang flick, which we don't, this flick accomplishes too little and runs too long wearing its characters down to nubs instead of fleshing them out with insights into familia, community, heritage, and church. Worst of all, we're not given anyone to care about leaving us with three hours of mechanical detachment.

            "content": "I have seen this film on cable several times, and the screenplay of Jimmy Santiago Baca was a masterpiece in depicting the dark world of prison gangs. Prison gangs have been deemed a security threat in every American prison, state or federal, and how members and family are bonded. \nThis film portrays the life of a biracial man (Damian Chapa, known as Carmine in Money Talks) that is hated by his real father (a Caucasian), and before he turns 18, murders a rival gang member to avenge his cousin's (Jesse Borrego) maiming, after he is bodyslammed onto a fire hydrant.  This event changes the lives of the three youths in the film. \nOne youth ends up becoming an artist, and a heroin addict, after his near-serious injury from the bodyslam, another goes to boot camp (Benjamin Bratt), after being arrested by the LAPD, and becoming a police officer, and the other ends up in prison, and ascends up the hierarchy of being a prison gang leader.  The Miklo character would be the focal point in the insurrection that occurs in the penitentiary, while the other men live separate lives.  The saddest scene in the film is the Cruz character, where he ends up being a heroin addict, and is devastated by the death of his younger brother, when he ODs after a trial shot.  This leads to Cruz being ostracised by his family, and this fuels the resentment by his half brother, the detective.   Lots of familiar faces, especially Thomas F. Wilson (Biff Tanner in the Back to the Future flicks) and Billy Bob Thornton (Armageddon) as a Nazi.",

That accurately sums up my experience when I first saw Bound by Honor/Blood In Blood Out.Behind the shy, inconspicuous exterior lies a powerful, almost real drama about the lives of three LA gang members who find their world changes as they grow up. Drug addiction, life in prison and 'betrayal' are the main subjects here and they don't fail to demand attention. I must honestly admit that I have watched this movie in awe, until the closing credits were gone. It's that good.Most of the actors aren't that famous (alright, you might recognize Benjamin Bratt for his role in Law & Order) and those who are have no real starring roles. In my opinion, this adds to the 'real feel' of the movie and is one of it's strong points (the casting, that is). Even Damian Chapa isn't bad in this movie (he usually is, think Street Fighter... Or U.S. Seals 2 :S) and I must praise him for his work. Both stars and supporting actors performed magnificently.But in my opinion, the real credit should go to the writer and the director, who made such interesting and real topics in to an engaging, 3-hour long drama that manages to captivate it's audience.

Its situations are formulaic, its white villains cartoonishly drawn, its \"nobility\" of the barrio/ghetto contrived and over-simplified. It actually paints a picture of the Hispanic ghetto life it that is far more derogatory of such ethnicities than typical Hollywood fare. The protagonists come off as weak-willed, mewling complainers prone only to every media-themed addiction, self-destructive behavior, and victim-label that modern sociology can bestow. It is, in fact, pure sociological pretension and conceit.\"Bound by Honor\" is hokum and silly stereotyping passing for \"socially aware\" and \"brave\" drama.

For a start it is repetitive beyond all belief: same riffs on blood ties, brothers, mothers, fathers and cousins etc etc etc ad nauseam throughout. Tedious to a degree that is extraordinary that it passed the producers.Secondly, the script has two pitches: loud and violent. That also makes it very boring. It is obvious how things will be shown in these two modes. A violent film can work on other levels but the writers are so inept that it escaped them to give this a few more tones.Thirdly, the story lacks precision as if it lacked a good editor. Therefore it has adopted the familiar course of amateurs, and that is to add everything in the story without giving it a balance and counter balance. There is no editorial overview of how to shape material within a reasonable time period. It is also very very long ...\"Anna Karenina\" is long, but that was by Tolstoy and he has some claim to be one of the greatest writers of all time.Fourthly, the actors: oh well, and the report card is depressing. Basically two modes of action. The leads are all generally terrible, especially Mr Chapa, whose performance might be compared to a guard dog with distemper. Such monotony should not be viewed in a feature film.As with anything that that exemplifies all that is detritus in film making, there are so many other things to mention but space precludes a fuller list of its faults. The music for instance, with its deliberate sentimental Spanish guitar style in the few quiet moments showed all the artistic intelligence of a fast food restaurant franchise.Almost anything on earth is better than wasting the time that is this dreadful waste of one's own too short life.",

The lead character wasn't too good an actor either. The detective in the movie, he was good. I've seen him in more recent work and he is a pretty good actor. This movie had the potential to be something really good.

Also, words like \"familia\", \"carnal\" and \"vatos locos\" are spoken so many times I started thinking somebody misunderstood the word \"filler\". It's not a bad movie, and Benjamin Bratt almost makes up for his movie brother's poor acting abilities, but the movie just runs for too long without a really satisfying ending. Chapa kind of picks up on his character as the movie goes by (well, he damn sure had more than enough time to redeem himself in this one-oh well) and it is a movie one does not forget that easily, but in the end it wasn't executed in the best possible way and came off as just too much a B-class wannabe smart movie.

The gangs in the prison San Quentin were very well acted out.  The BGA (Black Guerilla Army), the AV'ers (Aryan Vanguard), and La Onda were acted out very well.  It shows how miserable prison life can really be if you don't belong to the RIGHT group.The characters were great:  Big Al, Red Ryder, Pockets, Bonafide, Wallace, Montana, Magic, Miklo, Chuey, Cruz, Juanito, Popeye, Carlos, and the rest. I highly recommend this movie to anyone.  And it is not a cheap rip off from American Me.  American Me is much more serious and can get you quite sad. This movie is more entertaining, but I'm not knocking American Me. \nOne thing about this movie, \"Is Miklo a virgin in this movie?\"  He went into jail at age 18, then was only out for a bit till he went back in.

Very nicely done for realism sake and schockingly accurate. Mom and dad in this movie are the streets and you and your family live by clique rules.

For my part, I'd like to tell to everyone who likes movie scores that Bill Conti has made a fantastic job in this one. The music of Blood In Blood Out is amazing. It serves really well the ambiance and the spirit of the movie and I don't understand why this score has been so ignored by music amateurs. I dare to compare the chemistry which arose from this collaboration between the images of Taylor Hackford and the music of Bill Conti to the one who was born in the sixties between Sergio Leone and Ennio Morricone. Great job Mr. Conti. Thank you for your talent.",

There are many movies that I like and love, but if someone asked me about my favorite movie of all time, than I always say it is \"Blood in Blood out\".And that kind of sounds awkward, if the other person doesn't know the movie. It sounds like a horror movie or something. But then again I can't think of another/better title to this film (apart from \"Bound by honor\" under which it is also known). It's a movie about life.What makes it so great for me? Although I heard from some people that they don't like the acting, and maybe in some parts that's true (after all there's no one like Al Pacino or *add a favorite actor name here*). But it's more than appropriate for this movie and it's not distracting at all. In fact I was hooked by the movie from beginning to end.The story that is told here needs the film to be long and not one minute of it seems boring. The characters grab you from the very start and you feel with them the whole movie. Everything that happens to them, you are there to witness it and feel with/for them. That makes a good drama.I love every aspect of the movie. The only thing that I could complain about is, then whenever this movie is on somewhere (on TV) and I see it, I can't switch the TV off or change the channel. I have to watch that movie and take the emotional ride once again. :o)",

            "content": "'Blood In Blood Out', or 'Bound by Honor' as it is sometimes known, this is a solid film whatever the title, tracking the experiences of two Latino brothers and their cousin, each of whom go in diverse directions after a run-in with the police estranges them from each other. The film is very slow to warm up, only really taking off once the trio are arrested, but from then on there is a nary a dull moment to be had as the arrest influences one brother to become a policeman, the other to become an artist and the cousin to embrace jailbird life. Despite making very different life choices, fate eventually brings the paths of the trio together with each having to contend with having the same blood despite being on opposite sides of law and conventional living. If there is one thing to hold against the film, it is that it spends more than twice as much time on the cousin in jail as it does on the two brothers, but then again, his experiences in prison deliver all the highlights of the film. From attempted rapes to hidden messages to prison riots, the film depicts the jail experience of the 1970s in incredible depth with warring racial factions and unwritten codes of conduct that all abide by. The film is also blessed by one of Bill Conti's tersest music scores to date, a terrific supporting turn from Delroy Lindo and some remarkable artwork, including a full scale wall mural. Clocking in at close to three hours, this is not the lightest or breeziest film to get through, however, the ample length allows one to get under the characters' skins in a way that a shorter film could not have done half as well.",

I assume they were going to make another movie to explain this. Or how about movies like Doc Savage and the last Andy Hardy movie ended with one of those \"to be continued\" things or \"watch out for the next movie\". And for some reason there never was one. This movie did not end with one of those things, but there were hints like Michlo swearing revenge against Paco for shooting him thus causing him to loose his leg.

            "content": "Blood In, Blood Out, Bound by Honor (1993) is nothing more than a biggest budgeted cheese fest This movie is a cult classic because of the bad acting, goofy writing and several big stars in small roles hamming up every scene they're in. What made \"American Me\" brilliant is missing in this \"epic\". The direction is pedestrian, the camera work isn't that great and the editing leads a lot to be desired. The actors act in two modes in this one, over or under acting. Sappy and cheesy at the same time isn't very good. When it tries to be melodramatic it seems phony and forced. When the film tries to become serious it's laughable. People want to complain about the lead actor Damian Chapa, he's actually quite good in his role compared to the rest of the cast. At least he shows true emotions. Benjamin Bratt looks like he's either going to laugh over his bad lines or forces himself to look \"determined\" in others. Tom Towles is his usual over the top self. I wish he had a cigar to chomp on and a big mustache he could twirl.Most of the blame can be put on the director. Some of it could be put on the script and the rest on the supporting cast. The film was delayed because they didn't want any violence in the theaters. Maybe it was released too soon after \"American Me\" was finished making it's rounds at the box office. This movie never became a real hit and faded away into obscurity. After editing and re-editing, the finish result is a three hour violent soap opera. Like I said before, it's highly entertaining for all the wrong reasons. Fun stuff, makes a great party tape.Recommended.P.S. The best version out is the 190 minute version. Not only does it expand several scenes but extra violence is added making the movie actually better. But since I'm reviewing the theatrical version.

It's not only about gangs, prison etc. but also about the lives of immigrant families who loose their kids to the \"American way of life\", but also about family, love, defeat and overcoming your problems, like the oldest brother, who ends up on the better side of life. Ther are movies from Bad Boys to Colours to Boyz in tha Hood and they are all great, but the story is also about ethnicity, gangs from South Central L.A. are nothing like gangs from Hells Kitchen.

Of course the movie goes stereotypically even further in demonizing prison officials, as either unnecessarily mean or corrupt (or both). Too much Hollywood and ridiculous drivel in terms of \"real life\" as to warrant a high rating -- in fact some of the scenes are so obviously contrived and stupidly staged as to relegate this movie to the lower echelons of modern crime and gang-themed films.",

Jesse borrego gets Badly injured and becomes a drug addict. Damien Chapa gets caught by the police and ends up in prison. Benjamin Bratt who was once a street thug becomes a Honest police officer. Out of the three, Damien's story is the best. He starts of as a weak character in prison, who almost gets raped and slowly works his way up. After a couple of years, the story moves on to the connection between Benjamin and Damien. The movie has a clever ending, I'm sure I have seen a similar type ending in another movie, cant remember which. Although it is a 3 hour movie, it does entertain. The acting is efficient from the cast. If this had a better and popular starcast, it probably would of been among the Best Movies. Al Pacino or Robert De Niro would of suited in Benjamins role.

A very good depiction of street and prison gangs..(the fact that some of the actors and crew either were involved in gangs or had done time in jail helped make some of the roles more believable).The saddest character in the movie is the main protagonist Miklo Velka. despite his mother being a brown-eyed, blk haired Mexican, his white father's features constantly make him an outsider in his own community and his willingness to do whatever it takes to be accepted by his own people ends up having disastrous consequences for all involved in his life in the 12 years that the film takes place.One other thing I saw in the movie that really surprised me is when Popeye tells Miklo that he cannot get mad at another Latino in jail because they were both from rival gangs. In prison, they have to unite if they want to survive. I saw that as a unity born out of need to protect themselves.If you are Latin, regardless of type (cuban, Puerto-Rican,Peruvian,Mexican etc) see this movie.",

I remained drawn into the story from beginning to end. The level of realism in the drama that unfolds is eerie. The relationships that are displayed between the characters are impeccably played out. You get a real sense of family between the half-brothers and the cousin (the three \"main\" characters), and see it develop between Miklo and his prison \"familia\" as well. The \"making of\" featurette on the DVD really took me by surprise, and revealed with crystal clarity the depth of Taylor Hackford's vision and motivation to create this cinematic masterpiece. I echo the sentiments of comments I've seen expressing an interest in a full \"director's cut\" (4+ hours) and/or a disc with deleted scenes at the very least. There isn't anything predictable about this film (in my opinion), and it is truly a rare film experience that is full of surprises.

Men will like (love or hate) this movie based one its relationships between its dirty and clean wing. (FYI - I like to love this movie). When Miklo goes bad, he does it for Paco. When Paco goes good, he does it for what he did to Miklo. Great story, aLa E.H. (check 50 short stories for a check). Great movie, great acting, more important story about institutionalism.",

In 20 minutes you will know if you're in it for the long haul and if you do, you likely won't let go. I kept going until it was all said and done.What was supposedly going to be a five hour movie ended up very methodically cut to three hours. But no scene seems excessive.The Cinematography is ahead of its time, with some fluid shots a decade ahead of the year the movie was filmed in. It's set in the 1970s, 80s and 90s, but some scenes you can't even tell are from a given era, because of how fluidly the actors perform and lack of visual cues.I gotta say, I was recommended this by somebody who recounted an experience one of my relatives was going through with one of the film's characters. He remembered it that well, and you probably will too if you like the film enough.It's not available on any streaming services (Disney+, Hulu, Netflix or Prime) despite being owned by Hollywood Pictures. I think a probable reason why is the incredible amount of profanity and graphic situations the characters are in. You wouldn't want your little kids stumbling upon this movie - it is gritty.

There is even emotion in this movie and not just a typical gangster movie.After watching this, It opened up my eyes to the life of Spanish/Mexican gangs and the troublesome lives they live. It is a story of innocence, revenge and betrayal. It is also a story of coming of age and learning. Most importantly it is a movie that can deliver powerful messages to the audience whom feels gangsterism is a symbol or status.I applaud the writer, the director and all the actors for producing such a accomplished piece of cinema. The acting is very genuine and all actors feel comfortable in their roles and helps the movies progression. The authenticity is also there and much research has gone into this. Although this is a lengthy film, over 2 hours long, it is well worth the time to watch the story unfold as it would in the real world. Viewers of the movie should be aware some scenes are not for the faint hearted and may cause you to gasp in shock. At one point I even shouted at the screen, but I wont divulge which scene this was.Please watch this movie, if you are thirsty for something different and not commercial, this is the pick.",

I suspect that The Godfather was on the minds of some involved in this production while it was being made. Certainly, the character of Miklo is as tragic a figure as Michael Corleone, and also shows he is a traitor to himself and his mentor, much the way Corleone betrayed his own brother. Also, \"The Family\" has utmost importance in both films, but this film falters in places where Godfather excelled, and so it does not deserve the same consideration.",

It triggers the question of honoring the family and who to call \"family\" (in this case, \"familia\").  Viewer takes a step in the lives of the three friends, Paco (Benjamin Bratt), Cruz (Jesse Borrego), and Miklo (Damian Chapa).  The actors play their rolls to a tee, showing examples of \"if my character were in this situation, what would he do.\"  Paco is the hard-worker in all aspects - to be the \"big dog\" for either good or bad.  Miklo looks up to Paco and strives to be that \"big dog,\" also in all aspects, however, he grasps a hold on his destiny.  And Cruz is the artist and medium of the two - with the word \"artist\" used in its generalization of being liberated, depressed, and isolated.  The storyline begins with them together, then follows them unto their own paths, to only conclude with a means of reconciliation. \nTaylor Hackford uses the simplicity of shots to carry out this story.  He uses quick shot sequences presenting montages of what the viewer needs to know.  Also, usage of close-ups involving emotional eyes, as seen in his prior film, An Officer and a Gentleman.  A very good storyline to exemplify character revolution.  Bound by Honor takes the viewer within a world less known.",

The moment when they was on the hill changed their whole friendship or you can say the car window changed everything or Meeklo going to prison etc.Most of the characters in this movie were kinda boring and pointless but the ones that stood out. For example, Popeye, Meeklo and his other two friends. They seem the most genuine. I also liked Delroy Lindos character he was the most consistent gang leader, he kept it strong for the most part. Everyone else's gang started getting killed and their plan to takeover went straight out the door. Delroy Lindos character kept the black men strong, well until the end when they all die as well and end up the other gang groups. Solid 8/10 for me.",

            "content": "I think this movie is great and I'll tell you why. But first some trivia: The AV is based in the AB gang called the Aryan Brotherhood. Their members are known and respected in prisons for being especially murderous and ruthless though having smaller numbers than the other gangs. The BGA is based on the BGF black gorilla family gang (Delroy Lindo did a great job as Bonafide). They are a real gang and they claim to be politically motivated and are interested in black power. La Onda, as previously stated in another comment is based on \"La Eme\" or the Mexican Mafia. The members must deny its existence just like the real mafia or face death. These really are the three gangs that run the prisons in LA and across the country to this day. Also the concept of prison violence spilling onto the streets is a real issue. most gang violence in LA is Black on Black or Hispanic on Hispanic but when there is a war in the jails that is the main time that there is interracial violence on the streets. This is depicted well in the movie. More trivia: The Tres Puntos gang is based on a tattoo that many Hispanic gangs get with 3 dots. They signify the three possible ways out of a gang: prison, hospital, and death. The only flaw to this movie is that the actors may have overacted a little. This genre of movies rarely lends itself to great acting opportunities. think of the other great movies of its type e.g. Boyz in the hood, new jack city, menace to society. none of them won awards for best actor. but what sets this apart is that none of them touched on the jail aspect as much as this one did. The other nice thing was that nothing horrible happened at the end. Arguably everyone ended up alright, which is rare in this genre. Miklo became the boss of a powerful gang and spread the gang to other prisons, and Paco and Cruzito became friends again. On a side note, the slang used in this movie may be my favorite part.",

But \"Blood In Blood Out\", is far superior in pure entertainment value, in my opinion.  I have watched it (all 3 plus hours) many times and I have never gotten tired of it.  It is the kind of movie that sucks you in and is hard to press STOP once it gets going.I think that all the actors except one were great, especially Benjamin Bratt, Enrique Castillo, and Jesse Borrego.  It was especially amusing to see good old Billy Bob Thornton, as a neo-Nazi.The only actor that I do not include in the greatness is the more or less star Damian Chapa as Milko.  While other actors in the film had their overacting moments, this guy just wouldn't quit.  Every scene was just way too overdone with him and by the end he was just plain obnoxious.I give this movie a ten in spite of Chapa.

The ghetto is a importent part of their life's but the actual drama could easily been a king's court or something else Shakespearian.Many people I have seen this movie with complains about the acting but even if the actors are poor the characters still seem true. Often the ghetto turns into the fourth main character when we see how alive it really is.This is my all time favorite film. First watched it at a young age about twelve or so.

I not only rate it up there with L.A gangster movies but with the likes of gangster movies Scarface, Goodfellas, Casino etc. It is that good! It just doesn't have World class actors like Pacino in, but never the less the actors involved are fantastic at their roles, The director/producers deserve credit too because every detail about this film is perfect, the setting, the locations, the lingo used and even the extras look exactly how you would expect hardened Mexican/Black/White prisoners to look. Danny Trejo is in this and he along with the others makes you feel like you are actually in San Quentin. I HIGHLY Recommend this to anyone that likes gangster movies or interested in American prisons and the history of prison gangs, I definitely will be watching this over and over and just wish I discovered it earlier, if anyone knows anymore movies like this with actors like Borrego, Trejo etc please let me know",

Pitted with a choppy script with coarse language and a shifty stop-and-start plot, Bound By Honor is nonetheless a movie that you truly must see to appreciate.",

            "content": "The East L.A. milieu and some of the characters seem familiar, because some of the same ground was covered by \"American Me,\" the fiery 1992 film about Chicanos and prison by Edward James Olmos, who directed himself in the lead. \"Bound by Honor\" covers similar material in a less passionate and finally less meaningful way. Olmos would not have been capable, for example, of this film's evasive final shot, in which Paco and Cruz do a dance together in front of a mural showing them at the beginning of their lives - while the camera, in a helicopter, climbs gradually into the sky to manufacture a false feeling of conclusion for the film.\"Bound by Honor\" contains some effective performances, some moments of deeply felt truth, and a portrait of prison life that I assume is accurate. What seems to be missing is a clear idea of why the movie was made, and what the director, Taylor Hackford, wanted to say with it. The outcome of the hero's life leads us to the ancient lesson that power corrupts. But we knew that. And if power had not corrupted Miklo, his life would still have been a wasted one. There are no role models in this nihilistic story.Much of the movie shows a prison world where guards and officials essentially stand aside while prison gangs run the institution, distribute favors, make rules and enforce their laws with violence. The prisons are divided into three camps: the Chicanos, the blacks and the whites, who are of course portrayed as racist, although in fact they're exactly as racist as the others. Few prisoners of any race in this film can imagine themselves outside the roles assigned by their color. Their myopia is underlined by the enigma of the hero, who is not as brown as he thinks he should be.The gangs rule through uneasy truces and alliances, and the central purpose of Miklo's life is to bring about an alliance between the Hispanics and the blacks, to crush the power of the whites. Miklo works at first with the leader of the Chicanos, and then, benefitting from the treachery of another, he becomes their leader himself. His acquiescence in treachery is rather surprising, since it doesn't seem prepared for in the film.Olmos, in \"American Me,\" seemed more saddened and angered by the realities of street crime, gangs and prison life. If the goal of \"Bound by Honor\" is authenticity, that was merely the starting point for Olmos. He tried to show a character learning and growing - discovering that there is more to life, and more to being a person, than simply lining up with those who are like you, in order to hate those who are not like you.Hackford has said in interviews that \"Bound by Honor\" is an attempt to show the actual realities of Chicano life in East Los Angeles. But the movie essentially just does a good job of showing us the externals that regular moviegoers, TV viewers and newspaper readers have already seen. What \"Bound by Honor\" lacks is a vision to bring meaning to the material. Life can certainly be meaningless, but art can sometimes suggest ways in which we can understand it.The movie's lack of purpose is all the more disappointing because Hackford has directed a well-made film. The performances in all of the supporting roles have the ring of absolute authenticity, although Damian Chapa, in the lead, seems too introspective and passive. The narcissism and weakness of his character would be better suited to a major supporting role; he could be best friend, not hero, except that this film doesn't have a hero.Among the others, Delroy Lindo stands out as a black elder statesman among the prisoners (he was the Harlem crime kingpin East Indian Archie in \"Malcolm X\"). And Enrique Castillo, as the older Chicano prison gang boss who Miklo feels moves too slowly, gives a performance of depth and honesty - we feel that he understands the situation, instead of simply reacting to it.Miklo's two \"brothers,\" the policeman Paco (Benjamin Bratt) and the artist Cruz (Jesse Borrego), seem to contain complete stories within themselves; cutting to them from Miklo's story, we enter other, intriguing worlds. But Miklo, at the center of everything, is called upon to carry too much of the screenplay's assorted baggage.If he is confused, it is because his makers are; faced with a situation that seems made out of tragic dead ends, they do not know where to go with it, and so neither does Miklo.",

I love the music and characters who are bit over the top at some points in the movie but that doesn't hurt the film at all.

The police officer ends up in situations where he has to meet up with some of his old friends from the gang he was in.  The movie is pretty long but there's a lot to it.

            "content": "Blood In, Blood Out, Bound by Honor (1993) is nothing more than a biggest budgeted cheese fest This movie is a cult classic because of the bad acting, goofy writing and several big stars in small roles hamming up every scene they're in. What made \"American Me\" brilliant is missing in this \"epic\". The direction is pedestrian, the camera work isn't that great and the editing leads a lot to be desired. The actors act in two modes in this one, over or under acting. Sappy and cheesy at the same time isn't very good. When it tries to be melodramatic it seems phony and forced. When the film tries to become serious it's laughable. People want to complain about the lead actor Damian Chapa, he's actually quite good in his role compared to the rest of the cast. At least he shows true emotions. Benjamin Bratt looks like he's either going to laugh over his bad lines or forces himself to look \"determined\" in others. Tom Towles is his usual over the top self. I wish he had a cigar to chomp on and a big mustache he could twirl.Most of the blame can be put on the director. Some of it could be put on the script and the rest on the supporting cast. The film was delayed because they didn't want any violence in the theaters. Maybe it was released too soon after \"American Me\" was finished making it's rounds at the box office. This movie never became a real hit and faded away into obscurity. After editing and re-editing, the finish result is a three hour violent soap opera. Like I said before, it's highly entertaining for all the wrong reasons. Fun stuff, makes a great party tape.Recommended.P.S. The best version out is the 190 minute version. Not only does it expand several scenes but extra violence is added making the movie actually better. But since I'm reviewing the theatrical version. You take what you can get.Full uncut version A+Cut version A",

The fact that this movie got so many complements boggles the mind, to say the very least, and strikes fear into my heart concerning the state of mankind! And this is exactly why i'm going to purchase it on dvd. Confused? Don't be. I collect tons of movies (and this one being the worst movie on earth deserves a place in my pile of movies - somewhere near the top, so that everytime someone i can't stand or someone who i think needs to be punished for whatever reason, wants to borrow a movie - guess which one I'll highly recommend!)ISSUES WITH THIS MOVIE:1. The worst dialougue I've ever heard- So incredibly cheesy that it's hard to describe. Examples: \"I don't want his pork chop, i want his LIFE!!!\"...  or, when one of the inmates (aptly named Popeye) is speaking to some transvestittes, \"Hey Cinderella, get yourself a fella!\". Come on people... even some of guv'nr Arnie's legendary lines can't match these.2. It's supposed to be shot in the 70's, but has tons of delightful, rediculously bad early late 80's-early  90's hairdo's and music.3. The use of the word \"ese\" and \"homes\"/\"homie\". They're repeated atleast one hundred billion times during the course of this terribly long monstrosity.4. IT'S SOMETHING LIKE 3 FREAKIN' HOURS LONG!!! I could have mowed my lawn, given the dog a bath, and played fifteen games of pool.5. Did I MENTION that it was cheesy??? I mean come on! the \"BLACK GUIRILLA ARMY!\" hahahaha...  and the casting choice to cast a white lad as the star of this Hispanic movie..HOWEVER.........Strange as this sound, if you're young and have tons of time to kill, I suggest you watch this movie. After all, the loss of a FEW brain cells can't be that bad... Just like commando, this movie is pathetic, but it will make you laugh. To put it in another way - it's not bad like \"Gigli\", but \"Rambo 2\" bad.... pathetic, but widly entertaining (forgive the lack of elaboration). Not to stereotype, but it's the kind of movie that delivers a few laughs around a few guys and a two-four of beer. BUT... for viewers seriously considering renting this for a more conventional meaningful/ intelligent/enjoyable movie, AVOID IT LIKE THE PLAGUE!!!!",

It was like seeing a movie twice over. And its pretty hard for me to sit and do the same thing that long. But thank god it was nice or i would have been lying on the bed all day with a headache. And it amazes me that I sat through a movie that long without much fuss. It was pretty nice. The LA which many outsiders never see or hear about. The east LA, the gang wars, the drugs, inmates running the prisons and rape attempt on a white prisoner. And thirteen years of twist and turns in the fortune of the three brothers and their familias as tragedy and happiness went hand in hand of a community which just wanted to live and work with dignity as some of their own went the wrong way and destroyed their careers and lives. And with much of the second half happening in the prison it needed a good genuine drama which thankfully is delivered. The prison and the stories feel real. And you feel destroyed as you see criminals getting criminalized in an institution made to reform them. Gay cooks and prisoners and racially segregated groups which ran their business from the inside in lieu of money. Attacks being planned and committed on fellow prisoners. Its all there as it takes a lot out of you to watch and absorb all this and more for more three hours. But all said and done it engrosses you for most the time and its only in the middle when not much is happening when you look at the time remaining. But as the plotting and action starts you again get absorbed. I got out with a real good knowledge of the people and a side of one of my favorite cities I never knew about. For that I am happy that I watched this.Read more at: http://hightensionmovies.blogspot.in/",

I'm thirty years old now and find this movie fascinating in many ways. In 93 when the movie first screen I was 18 years old straight out of high school and I love it as much now as I did then. Growing up in LA, I'm compelled and must give credit to the directors and producers for the accuracy/ relevancy in which they represent Los Angeles in the 70's/80's. This movie has many underlying tones and other than the fact that this movie is geared by no Mexican or Chicano actors (Paco Peruvian and Cruz Puerto Rican) this movie is a hit. \"La Onda don't shine shoes\" Go UCLA in 2005 (Beat the streak) FUSC",

So I told my boyfriend that we needed to see it.In my opinion it was thought out well, and filmed good. Some people may not understand the movie, because some of it is in Spanish, but its kind of self explanatory.I thought that it touched on the Vatos Locos lifestyle.And for people who aren't aware of it could learn from it. What they said or portrayed of them was basically how it REALLY is.I would recommend this movie to others.",

Can one go from being a gang member to being a cop without \"selling out.\"? If one's father is white, and one looks like him, can one ever truly be accepted in the culture of one's mother?There are scenes in the movie that just tear at one's heart. So, yes, I did cry. And I am willing to admit that.See this film. Or you're lame.",

You have to create a life here, which means gaining honor and respect. It takes time I mean look at me I've been in here for almost ten years.\" This movie has the best perspective of what men experience inside those lonely walls. I miss my father so much, and understand the pain he is experiencing in his life right now.",

            "content": "Best movie ever. I think this movie is the one movie out of all that has the most epic quotes. There are even web pages devoted to quotes from blood in blood out. I am aware the actors are not up there with De Niro, Pacino and company but fact remains they helped create some of the most memorable characters in movie history. Who can forget characters like Popeye, Spider, Big Al or the troubled artist Cruzito! Also I think this movie appeals to something else than the wannabe gangster within us. It speaks of the sphere between cultures, the \"in betweeners\". Main character Milko is, as Montana tells him, \"stuck in the middle.\" He struggles with being both \"white\" and Chicano. This movie really was a favorite back when I was a kid and to this day I still watch it from time to time and let it bring me back to East Los Angeles in the seventies. And did I mention the never ending source of quotes? \"Hey Cinderella, go find yourself a fella\", \"I don't want his pork-chop, I want his life\", \"cuidado con el Chorizo we might need it for later\" just to name a few of very legendary quotes this movie has left the world with.",
