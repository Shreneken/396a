            "content": "Jubei, a rouge samurai who's wandering the land becomes involved unwillingly in the battle between an evil group of supernatural demon warriors known as the Eight Devils of Kimon and the country's government. After a town was wiped out overnight by a plague, so the eight devils could get in to get perform a certain mysterious task. Jubei soon is joined by a poisonous female samurai known as Kagero to find out the Devils' business is in this town, after one of them wipe out her ninja team and nearly her if it hadn't been for Jubei. He also encounters someone of the past, who he thought that he already had killed. So I've gone back to my roots when anime was a childhood favourite of mine, but this one isn't for kids. I loved this flick when I was in my early teens, so watching it now was such a nostalgia trip and surprisingly it still holds up exceptionally well. The popular worldwide hit \"Ninja Scroll\", which was directed by Yoshiaki Kawajiri (who brought us the excellent \"Vampire Hunter D\") paves way for a maturely slick, extremely violent and intensely erotic outlook. Everything about it comes thick and fast. It frenetically exploits the blood sprayed violence like a running tap, but still never loses that beautifully tender edge that seeps into many of the situations. The compelling premise isn't a mind-bender, although a bit jaded, but its simple origins only enhance the taut lay out and poignantly dark array of blisteringly out-there conflicts. It's surprising in it developments and you're left amazed by the film's personality and unique world that's created. It vividly captures the period of this atmospheric world. They're such an imaginatively diverse barrage of dynamic characters, with the likes of the rock-build demon to the hunchback whose hump are a wasp nest and a snake lady who can actually shed her skin. This gave it a real eastern mythological state and only proves that the bad guys had the most fun. The story might feel like its there only to set up one spirited confrontation after another and really it is. But the story-telling element is effectively defined, as most of the main players get enough time to mould there own back story and present their significance to where it could be heading. Jubei makes a cool anti-hero and Kagero fits nicely along side him. The skillful animation has class, agility, originality and distinguishing details making its way into these stunningly pristine visuals. An aggressively crisp sounding FX makes the experience a whole lot more impressive with such a wide range and the oriental twang found in the eerily mystic music score makes this presentation more brooding in its blinding passion and checkered emotion. Kawajiri faced no restrictions here, and was free to come up with an illustriously innovative and majestic anime piece that works in every frame. \"Ninja Scroll\" is more highly involving than you would believe. Recommended.",

            "content": "Ninja Scroll is definetly one of the biggest gems when it comes to traditional-ninja-mythology Anime. The story isn't too complicated but gives each character enough room to unfold their very own personality and ambitions. The pacing of this movie is perfectly balanced between smashing action scenes and calm dialogues. The great combination of sound fx music dark imagery create an absolutely fantastic mystic vibe so you can click in at any time and I guarantee you'll find yourself in a beautiful piece of art. The fight scenes are to this day one of the best the Anime genre has ever produced. Since every character has their own special set of abilities, skills and tricks every fight turns out to be a unique battle between masters of their very own art. Especially the diversity of the villains give the fights a nice kind of variety. Overall this is just a fantastic classic Anime movie with big impact to this day and an absolute must see for every true Anime fan.",

Ninja Scroll captivated me from start to finish, with the ultra-violent scenes and gore it is perhaps not for all, but from an animation and storytelling perspective it is really one of the most engrossing animated films I have ever seen. The animation is stupendous, every action has so much detail but the backgrounds and colours have many moments of dark or ethereal beauty to them. The music is haunting and sweeping, the characters are interesting with a lot of depth and conflict in them, but other than the fast, clean and incredibly compelling action the star was the storytelling, often dark and poignant but never less than riveting. Overall, captivating from start to finish, a must see. 10/10 Bethany Cox",

            "review_title": "The best in adult Anime'",
            "content": "\"Ninja Scroll\" is a relentlessly adult Anime' from none other than Yoshiaki Kawajiri, the director behind other notable film threats of the genre such as \"Wicked City\" (1987). \"Ninja Scroll\" is also one of the best Anime' films I've ever seen, as it contains more than its fair share of graphic swordplay combat and plenty of exposed (female) flesh, sex, and out-there mysticism.It has one of those murky, hard-to-follow plots typical of a lot of Japanese animation, but it involves a wandering vagabond, Jubei, who also happens to be a master swordsman. He's the best there is, simply put. Like all heroes of his caliber, however, he's not without many demons haunting his past.As the film opens in 17th-century feudal Japan, we already get a sense of just how skilled he is when he strikes down two would-be attackers but leaves a third one alive to tell of the lethal encounter. The main plot of \"Ninja Scroll\" gets underway when a lone female villager blindly wanders into a neighboring village bearing news that a mysterious plague has decimated her community.The local government, fearing an epidemic, quarantines the village until an investigation can be completed. Mixed reports conflict with the official story of a plague, saying that men on horses were seen riding from the village the night before. The chamberlain sends a team of ninja warriors to the village to get to the bottom of what happened there. Along with them, the beautiful ninja warrior Kagero joins them, against the wishes of the team's leader.But the team is ambushed and annihilated by an unseen presence in the woods while on their way to the village, leaving Kagero as the only survivor and held captive by her attacker, a monstrous rock of a man who proceeds to rape her. She is later rescued by Jubei, who takes down Kagero's captor. As it would turn out, Jubei and Kagero become unlikely allies, along with a wandering monk, as they each realize they've been swept up in a covert plot to overthrow the Japanese government.It seems that Himuro Gemma, a former nemesis of Jubei, has enlisted the aid of The 8 Devils of Kimon, a fearsome army of warriors with supernatural abilities, to help him in his devious plans. Some of them include the aforementioned rock, the wasp fighter, the blind swordsman who challenges Jubei to a duel in a bamboo forest, and my personal favorite, the luscious Benisato, who can animate the snake tattoos on her naked body and command them to attack her opponent. So together, Jubei, Kagero, and the monk team up to defeat this supernatural threat to the government.As with most mature Anime', \"Ninja Scroll\" does not come up short on the desserts (you know what I mean). (But, Kagero's rape scene should definitely turn away some viewers.) But aside from that and a twisted plot, it does deliver the goods in terms of identifiable characters you can (somewhat/almost) relate to. Jubei is the only \"normal\" character in the whole movie, being that he doesn't have any supernatural powers (aside from his extraordinary sword skills) and when he gets hurt, he bleeds. Kagero, on the other hand, has a few surprises of her own, as any man who sleeps with her will die because she is literally pretty poison; all of her being is so deadly that even a kiss could kill a man in seconds. Whoa.However, this particular defense (or curse?) represents the basis of Kagero's greatest tragedy, in that she is unable to love anyone who touches her. It makes her the most well-rounded, deep and sympathetic female character in the entire movie (a rare find in Japanese animation), since most women are usually whores or are submissive or weaker when compared to men, and it makes her death that much more emotional and Jubei's quest to avenge her much more romantic.The animation is fantastic and doesn't look dated that much at all. Since \"Ninja Scroll\" is one of the more notorious Anime' flicks out there, you have to wonder: When's this going to get the American cinematic treatment? I mean, after all, \"Ninja Scroll\" is one of the most popular Anime' flicks of all time. And since Hollywood's originality is drying up, they could be pretty thirsty for ideas, and comic books, Japanese horror movies, Anime' and Manga are all looking pretty ripe.I honestly hope this doesn't happen. Besides, I don't think something like \"Ninja Scroll\" could translate that well into live-action anyways without looking ridiculous. The graphic violence won't translate either, since a live-action adaptation of \"Ninja Scroll\" would be justifiably rated \"NC-17.\"\"Ninja Scroll\" is truly one of the best Japanese animated films out there right now. Let it live on in notoriety, without intrusion from us greedy Americans.10/10",

After a controversial screening on commercial TV some years ago, the video version was upgraded from MA to an R-Rating, and had some sex scenes cut.

            "review_title": "probably in my top 10 favorites of anime",
            "content": "Ninja Scroll is memorable in that, for its intended audience, it's got a lot of very well animated violent sequences, some rough but sharply defined characterizations, and a journey/story that is not too hard to figure out. It's got that samurai edge of 17th century lore from Japan, but it's also kinetic in its style, and abrasive at times in what it reaches to accomplish. It's also fun, most of the time, which is hard to be said for some very finely animated but incoherent samurai anime flicks or shows. After a village is destroyed by some weird plague, a samurai goes on a quest to find a dangerous foe who's seeking to overthrow the government. In the meantime, however, this quest involves facing off against deranged, fantastical demons set up by this head-foe. Of course a female counterpart (after being recovered by a near-vicious rape) accompanies him on the journey as well. It's an anime film that more than anything gives some individually memorable sequences, where style is really the key. The director, Yoshiaki Kawajiri, understands the importance of giving the scenes of daring-do a quick (but not too quick) power and splash of violence this level of dark, mature anime requires. But there are also some scenes of just plain dialog that work well too. Like my favorite 'cult' anime film, Fist of the North Star, Ninja Scroll has a story that needs a little paying attention to, but not by a lot. It's more concerned with the fates of the major players, and the side characters that come in and out (including a mysterious old-man character, as almost every anime film has one) are meant more for comic relief or moments of subtle intrigue. With an overwhelming climax, and some very solid swordplay throughout, Ninja Scroll is a must see for genre fans, and it might appeal to non-anime animation fans as well. It's got the thrills of regular samurai films, and the imagination, often over-the-top but sometimes darkly funny, that can only come from 90's era anime.",

However, I believe that as a movie, Ninja Scroll has a wider appeal.The visuals are top-notch, and the action is fast and clean. The sword fights can be watched frame-by-frame (and may have to be, if you want to really understand what is happening) and your awe at the quality of this movie will just increase. Do I sound like an obsessed fan? Because this movie impresses me so greatly that I cannot over-rate it.\nThe story and characters, though, are the main focus of this presentation, which each battle, duel, and other confrontation serving to move the story forward, develop, reveal, or eliminate the characters - all of whom are revealed in a way that is engrossing.Some maybe turned off by the gore, violence, and low value placed on human life; but that is what this time period was about. This is definately for mature audiences.If you do not yet own a copy of this, watch it as if you had never heard of it and enjoy the story developing.

The animation is done brilliantly and the English dubbing is done realistically.The characters are all quite likable when they are made to be liked. The villains are very scary and the stone guy at the start, damn i won't want to mess with him. The animated scenery is amazing for the nineties. It really makes the characters stand out.The plot is very tense and exciting. Its about a young hero who has to protect a girl who has poisonous body which kills any man who sleeps with her from evil and demonic beings. He is assisted by a con-man and faces someone from his past. This does seem pretty similar to other sorts of films but it is still very gripping.But don't let this cross your mind. It is not a kids cartoon. This is strictly for adults. This is very graphic and the most violent anime since the legendary AKIRA. There is also a rather disturbing rape scene near the start which has definitely earned its 18 rating.",

            "content": "WICKED CITY was among the bootleg anime that was circulated in this country before AKIRA came along and proved, beyond a shadow of a doubt, that American audiences were ready for adult animation. (\"Adult\" in the approach to animated storytelling.) I caught AKIRA during its initial theatrical run and it was satisfying, indeed, to not only see it on the big screen, but to also finally see it dubbed in English. While most anime doesn't make it to the big screens hereabout (curious, indeed, when one considers the fact that Animego is based here), there's anime aplenty at the local retail outlets. It's expensive, but there are several titles worth their weight in cost: WICKED CITY, VAMPIRE HUNTER D, VAMPIRE HUNTER D: BLOODLUST, ROBOT CARNIVAL, GENOCYBER, TETSUJIN 28, any ASTRO BOY (the original black and white series being the best), DEVIL MAN, GILGAMESH, FULL METAL ALCHEMIST, YU YU HAKASHO, NARUTO, KIKI'S DELIVERY SERVICE, GOLGO 13, GHOST IN THE SHELL (any), PRINCESS MONONOKE, METROPOLIS, GACHAMAN (any), PROJECT ARMS, WOLF'S RAIN, WITCH HUNTER ROBIN, BAOH, and NINJA SCROLL, to name but a few. NINJA SCROLL, with its seemingly endless invention, is probably my all-time favorite. The animation is about as good (great) as it gets. Kawajiri's direction is to be envied (even WICKED CITY and VAMPIRE HUNTER D: BLOODLUST, as nigh perfect as they are, can't beat NINJA SCROLL). If you're tired (as am I) of the lackluster Americanimation being cranked out by the studios, switch gears and check out some of the aforementioned anime.",

The lead ninja here gets poisoned rather early and has to find a cure and there is a bunch of other things too as we have a couple of rather cool enemy ninja for our heroes to fight off. Then the movie ends just in a rather weak fashion on a boat, I would like to suggest to the people who made this film you save your coolest villains to the finale not the beginning and middle of the film.

This is a movie that does none of the above. It just provides entertainment. It wasn't made to be the greatest movie of all time - even though the creators may think it is.  Yet, who doesn't think the movie they put  out is the greatest masterpiece ever made?  The point I'm trying to make is that Ninja Scroll was not made to appeal to everybody.  It is just the imagination of some men somewhere and they thought it was good enough to put on the screen and make money.To all of the people trying to disseminate the movie and peel out meaning, \"What are you trying to prove?\"  There is blood, gore, some scenes not suitable for children and even some small-minded adults, and bad language, in general.  To all the people who want to sit down and see a well-executed anime movie with a plot with few holes and scenes that are unbelievable few and far between (even in the fantasy animation realm) while not have to think while watching - this is it.  The dubbed version was just as good as the subbed (sub-titled) version.  All you have to do is enjoy.So if you haven't seen the movie and would like not a mind trip like Donnie Darko or 12 Monkeys, or not to have a moment that all is right for the character even though he went though garbage in the beginning like A Beautiful Mind or The Shawshank Redemption, or not to have a good cry like The Green Mile or Braveheart or not even to have to interpret your own meaning of what's really going on like Akira or Princess Mononoke, then just sit back and see how animation and that feeling that makes you wonder 'how did they think to put that in the movie' collides then watch Ninja Scroll. If you go into it with an open mind then you will see why the action fans believe it one of the greatest anime movies ever made.",

The characters are very unique and all have interesting aspects to them. Whether it be physically or mentally. A great example of this is the character Yurimaru. This is a great character because we see that he has an goal, a desire, an attitude, and an ability to conduct electricity. All the characters are like this, only in different, yet good way. And that's one reason I love this film. Another reason why I love this film is because of the delays/detours the story branches off into every time Jubei encounters another enemy. For instances his second encounter with Tessai. The story doesn't go TOO far astray. And one of he reasons that we know this, because Jubei is always willing to move on, with the twist of his slow death (Simply because he has to). This brings a bit of variety and integrity to the film. And finally the action. I strongly believe that if you have an interesting story and creativity, you won't look at the action with such cynical eyes. Movies that want to be extremely flashy with the action, don't make it as interesting because the viewer knows it for show, and not for the story. But this movie doesn't cross the boundary of action, and move across the territory story, that many films today do. So I can appreciate the action more simply because it fits well. All these aspects of the film (and some other minor ones), make \"Ninja Scroll\" (J\u00fbbei ninp\u00fbch\u00f4), one of the few ideal Anime films of all time.",

Plague's spread through the towns, well an evil force lurks, with 8 devils rise to take the land. It all begins with Jubei Kibagami (K\u00f4ichi Yamadera, Japanese version) a traveller who passes town to town with a hidden past. Well coming across Kagero (Emi Shinohara) a woman who tests food in her village, and has the curse of any man who makes love to her will die. It's beautiful in parts, and the animation is superb. The directing from Kevin Seymour and Yoshiaki Kawajiri is superb. Also written by Yoshiaki Kawajiri. Winner of the 1993 film festival of Japan and worth the watch, i've owned it since i was 16 now, and still gets a play from time to time. 8/10",

            "content": "Ninja Scroll (J\u00fbb\u00ea ninp\u00fbch\u00f4) (1993): 9 out of 10: One of a bevy of Anime films to come stateside in the early to mid-nineties Ninja Scroll along with Akira, Ghost in the Shell, and Urotsukidoji. Ninja Scroll helped set the agenda of anime as a serious art form with very adult themes. Or if you prefer the agenda of cartoons with lots of nudity and violence and tentacle sex.I have seen Akira about half a dozen times and could not describe the plot to you at gunpoint. There is a motorcycle and a nuclear explosion and then it gets a bit fuzzy. Ninja Scroll does not suffer from this.Taking place during the era of the Tokugawa Shogunate local villages are apparently dying from a plague. The local Mochizuki Chancellor Hyobu sends out his sizable ninja force to investigate. Coming along is his female food tester and ninja leader love interest Kagero. While in the woods they run into what appears to be a very large stone golem who slaughters all the ninjas tearing the arms of the ninja leader and drinking the blood that pours out of them. He only spares Kagero as he plans to rape and then kill her or maybe kill and then rape her as he notes it doesn't matter to him.At this point, the sounds of thousands of parents desperately looking for the VCR remote and wondering how Blockbuster could rent such a cartoon could be heard across the land. Also at this point, our hero shows up.Our hero Jubei is a Ronin... well actually he states he is a ninja... Though truth be told he isn't very ninja-like but instead much more of a swordsman. A ninja swordsman ronin perhaps? Anyway, he is a swordsman for hire more interested in doing good than earning gold. A very classic character in both Japanese film and American Westerns where there is much overlap between the two (Seven Samurai and The Magnificent Seven being the most famous.). He also owes a lot to the Lone Wolf and Cub manga.Jubei's key as a character is his superpowers. He doesn't have any. He wins through skill and an awful lot of skin of the teeth luck. He is a very vulnerable hero. There is an appeal to this hero that both anime and western media often forget. Think of the appeal of the bloody foot everyman that Bruce Willis played in Die Hard and now compare to the car crashing into a helicopter superhero Bruce Willis played in Live Free or Die Hard.Jubei needs that luck because he is actually up against the eight devils with the Stone Golem only being the first one. Video game aficionados will recognize this for what it is a collection of spectacular boss fights with the final boss being a man who can shapeshift and regenerate at will. Ninja Scrolls influence on modern video game design and follow up anime such as Naruto is self-evident.The animation all hand-drawn is spectacular. The action scenes are very well staged and the eight demons are extremely grotesque and creative. (There is one demon that is a hunchback with a beehive where his hunch should be or maybe bee. I had the voice of Nicholas Cage in The Wicker Man throughout all his scenes.)Ninja Scroll even manages a bittersweet love story and some nice humor through the chaos. For a brief ninety-four minutes, it packs in a lot of story and characterization without a seemingly wasted frame.\nHighly recommend this film for anime fans who somehow missed it or haven't seen it in twenty years and to newcomers though I do warn the newcomers the first twenty minutes are kinda rough till the characters start to take hold. An excellent action film with a great story and some surprisingly deep characters.",

I couldn't stop watching it even though it should have a warning label with a skull and crossbones on the front of it. \"Ninja Scroll\" is royally unreal.  It has the shock value, violence and gore of \"Perfect Blue\" and \"Ghost In The Shell\" (they are also Manga, need I say more?).  Unlike the aforementioned, it sticks mostly to action and visual style and opposed to philosophical and emotional value.  The story is relatively straightforward with no major plot twists.  The characters on the other hand were probably from the after effects of major drug use by the writer (look at the demons in the film).  The story, character development, animation, writing and direction were all in a class of their own.  This movie is completely original and almost unmatched by anything currently out there (other Manga productions I have seen rival it).  This should be considered an animated classic for the 1990's.  I give this film a 10 out of 10!Here ends my rant!",

            "content": "I'd like to start off by saying that I am not a fan of anime, I actually only watched this movie because a friend recommended it to me and I remember it being really popular with computer geeks when I was in high school. The reason I never really got into anime was mainly because I was never able to take seriously something that featured a character screaming at the top of his lungs, and the only thing moving on the entire screen was his or her mouth. Just doesn't look right to me and doesn't strike me as very high quality entertainment or even very skilled animation.Ninja Scroll, however, while there are definitely plenty of examples of that, has a lot to offer beyond just an animated action/violence cartoon. There is some serious violence here, but I think that a lot of the novelty is not just to see killing and blood but to marvel at the extent of what can be accomplished in an animated movie that can't be done in a live action film. The story is interesting (although a little difficult to follow at times, what with all of the different names of clans and warlords and ninjas and whatnot), and it pulls you along through the conflict in a world that is far removed from reality but more than able to entertain. There is a variety of sinister and creative villains for our hero to face, and the important thing here is that they are not just a lot of mean guys with big guns. These guys have every weapon from gigantic boomerang/axes to immunity to death to wispy threads not unlike that one that Irene's grandmother gave her as a guide in The Princess and the Goblin (how's THAT for an obscure reference!) except that they entail startlingly accurate deadliness. I am certainly not an expert in the field of anime, but I can definitely say that the anime world has held no interest whatsoever for me, but Ninja Scroll has increased my interest in seeing more.",

Ninja Scroll is a fantastic, samurai themed action adventure; filled with imagination, especially with the designs of the bizarre creatures that inhabit the strange take on Feudal Japan. There is also some of the best animation ever, take Jubei's fight with the blind swordsman in the forest for instance... The animator's under the direction of Anime guru Yoshiaki Kawajiri (Monster City, Wicked City) have created a mood and atmosphere that only animation can pull off. And the fight scenes, this must have been what Ang Lee was hoping for with Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon, but animation has no limitations. It's definitely the best in Kawajiri's loose trilogy, much better than Wicked City and definitely on par with the pretty good Monster City (which was probably a prototype for this film). So if you're not put of by the strong scenes of gore, but you like animation at it's finest, then give this a try.",

A group of eight demonic ninjas, the Eight Devils of Kimon, has wiped out a village along with most of those sent to investigate. Jubei helps survivor Kagero, a beautiful female ninja and is soon caught in a fight with one of the Eight Devils of Kimon. He then confronted by Dakuan who tells Jubei that he has poisoned him and if he wants the antidote he will have to help defeat the remaining Devils.Together Jubei, Kagero and Dakuan tackle the various Devils; each of them has their own distinctive demonic power; one has skin as hard as stone; one has snake tattoos that become real snakes and another has a wasp hive in his back to describe just three of them. We also learn that Kaguro has a power/curse of her own\u0085 her body is poisonous in a way that means any man who makes love to her will die.This is a really enjoyable film for those who love ninja action and villains with imaginative superpowers. There is a lot of action; most of it is pretty bloody so this definitely isn't a 'cartoon for kids'! This action is well animated and exciting; there is a feeling that just because somebody is a protagonist they aren't immune from real danger. The character designs are impressive and distinctive and the backgrounds look great too. There is some sexual content, including a disturbing assault against Kagero that may bother some viewers. Overall I'd recommend this to older anime fans who are looking for lots of exciting action.These comments are based on watching the film in Japanese with English subtitles.",

Being a senior, I decided to go, but it completely sucked, so around midnight, I decided enough was enough. When I got home I decided to throw on HBO since we were getting a free preview at the time. Well, low and behold an anime flick was on. I decided why not, since I really, really enjoyed Urotsukidoji, Devil Man, Akira and the whole lot. In a matter of minutes I was completely and totally hooked. Leaving that crappy end of the year party was one of the best decisions I've made in my entire life.The story of Ninja Scroll focuses mainly around Jubei. A rogue Ninja who accidentally gets mixed up with an old Nemesis named Gemma. Gemma is now back and has a plethora of supernatural Demons at his side. His goal is to completely rule the Country, and so far, so good. But Jubei also has help in the form of beautiful but deadly Kagema and the old crafty secret government agent Dakuan. They have banded together and are out to stop all of Gemma's devil sidekicks and finally Gemma himself. But with the odds completely against them, this task is almost completely impossible.Ninja Scroll is by far one of the most memorable movies you will ever see. That is if you enjoy your action bloody, your women beautiful, your villains extremely evil, your characters all fleshed out uniquely, your dialogue witty and realistic....see where I'm going here? This is a masterpiece in every sense of the word. I see that some people who enjoy anime don't see the big picture here, and I feel bad for them. This is the ultimate Ninja action flick. It delivers on every single cylinder, and if you haven't seen this film and are a fan of action/adventure/martial arts/anime films it is a must, must see. 10 outta 10 for the incredibly entertaining Ninja Scroll.",

It sounded interesting enough and so I gave it a try.Now, here I should say what makes or breaks movies for me is mainly an interesting story, good (as in believable) characters and atmosphere. I felt Ninja Scroll had all of it. It might remind you of certain Eastern movies, such as Hidden Tiger, Crouching Dragon or the Matrix (which was actually influenced by this movie) and since it predates them, it makes it all the more original. It definitely isn't a \"cartoon for kids\".The story may not be too inventive, but it kept me interested pretty much from the very beginning. The 8 demons seem a bit like bosses in a video game, but just like bosses in a video game, you're curious about the next one and their skill(s). Maybe not the most inventive idea, but it absolutely works, at least for me.The male and female character don't fall into the traditional \"happy ending\" trope, as it often is the case in Western films.So why just 8? I was thinking to give it a 9, but I'll have to see how knowing the story will affect any re-watches. Still, I can't find much that is wrong with this movie if you're planning to be entertained, I'm certain you will be.Hopefully, there won't be any real life adaptation of this film, I just can't imagine that, especially with CGI. It would just look awkward and even if it was Japan-made, I think some movies benefit from the possibilities only animation offers. It adds to the overall dark tone of the film and makes it a very entertaining one.",

            "content": "Ah another anime movie I saw back in the 90's because I felt I had to see it as it was seen as the right/popular thing to do/see (so easily influenced when you're young). Yes in my early to mid-teens (can't remember) I did see this anime (somehow) after seeing and hearing lots about it...probably mainly in Forbidden Planet. As I recall I didn't actually like this film upon seeing it (same with most animes at the time) because it simply wasn't really my thing at the time. Back then my young self was all about Arnie and JCVD so this didn't really fit into my wheelhouse.So seeing as I'm on this little anime binge right now its time to revisit this supernatural samurai epic. Firstly what's it all about? Well like other anime films the plot is actually quite simplistic. Taking place in feudal Japan, Jubei Kibagami is a Ronin of sorts, a wandering masterless samurai looking for work. Upon rescuing the female ninja Kagero Jubei finds himself caught up in a battle against the eight devils of Kimon who are a team of supernatural ninjas hired by the Yamashiro clan to protect their secret gold mining operation. The gold are payments to the Toyotomi Shogun of the Dark for protection. In turn the Shogun of the Dark wants to use the gold to buy Spanish weaponry to overthrow the current Japanese government. Bottom line, Jubei and Kagero must defeat all the bad guys to protect the government.Visuals and Animation: So let's just get down to the nitty-gritty. This film looks amazing, stunning, sumptuous. The director is once again Yoshiaki Kawajiri (of 'Wicked City' and 'Vampire Hunter D: Bloodlust' fame) and it is obvious in the style. The animation is silky smooth throughout with tonnes of tiny details. For example there are many simple shots of nature, such as fireflies, rippling water, trees, birds etc...which are there merely to add atmosphere in the moment but at the same time are beautifully drawn and animated. There is absolutely no slacking on any frame of this animation I assure you. Every frame looks like an exquisite watercolour painting from the bamboo forest to the mystical woodlands to the shimmering bodies of water. Add to that various striking sequences that utilise only one or two colours such as red and black or shades of blue which look very dynamic and comicbook-esque.Violence and Non-Consensual Sex: As you might expect with a sword based anime feature there is indeed a lot of violence...and it's amazing. The ninja based action is nothing short of breathtaking as characters whizz around the screen slicing and dicing in super-smooth animation. I think the first fight we see sets out the stall for the film. A group of ninja is massacred whilst investigating an attack on a local village by one of the eight demons of Kimon. They are brutally cut to pieces by his flying blade which then culminates in their leader having his arms ripped off (out of their sockets) in a shower of claret. Said demon does actually eventually get his own blade firmly implanted in the centre of his skull. There are some amazing katana fights between Jubei and various villains which are heightened by the sound effects which really add some weight to the proceedings. And of course you have the obligatory supernatural elements of gore and trickery that are a staple diet of these productions.Another staple of Kawajiri's animes seems to be nudity and rape (gulp!). Yes once again the lead female character Kagero seems to be more of a sexual toy for certain fantasies rather than a strong female character (although she still is that). Now whilst 'Wicked City' was more bizarre with its body horror element this film feels a bit more realistic, almost. Sure the characters doing the rape are supernatural demons but they still have human form and are generally dressed in historic attire. So yeah there are nipples and sucking and fingering and rope bondage and licking...all whilst being unconscious. The fact that Kagero's body is covered in a poisonous toxic that can't be cured makes the porn aspects seem more dangerously kinky and vindicating if that's at all possible, or just me.The other rather hilarious and uncomfortable plot point is the fact that Dakuan informs Jubei that the only way to rid himself of the poison he gave him (Dakuan deliberately injects poison into Jubei via a ninja star to blackmail him into doing his bidding) is to have sex with Kagero. Apparently the toxins across Kagero's body will combat and reverse the poison in Jubei's body. So not much pressure there then! Unfortunately for Kagero Jubei declines (she fancies him) but later on he kisses her and cures himself that way (so why didn't Dakuan just say that?).Representation: Yes there is LGBTQ representation in this old anime film. It seems in times gone by people have been happy to showcase gay characters despite what the far-left Twitterati try to force down our throats. Gemma's right-hand man Yurimaru is his male lover! He even pushes back on a fellow female villain's advances! How about that then! We don't see any man love, surprising when you think about it, but the representation and lovers angst is definitely there.Old Wise Men: Another aspect of these animes that seems to keep popping up is the wise old man character, something I have pointed out in previous reviews. Yep in this story Jubei and Kagero are aided by the short, Yodi-esque, troll-like character of Dakuan. Dakuan is a government spy charged with helping Jubei kill the demons. As already stated he does so by poisoning Jubei and promising him the cure after he completes the mission. As you might expect Dakuan is one of these characters that hides much of his skills, only showing the odd glimmer of what he can do. We know he has some kind of special powers and we know he can move quickly (despite his appearance) and is an expert in stealth. Again, like other similar characters, Dakuan is also the comedic relief in the film.As for the other characters, its the usual anime cliche truth be told. The main protagonist Jubei is your standard good looking western-esque anime hero with a slim wiry physique, lightning katana skills, and long flowing dark hair. His female partner is again your standard attractive western-esque looking heroine with a slim physique, a slightly tomboy-ish hairstyle, and also lightning fast weapons skills.Most of the main bad guys also have a very cliched look about them which we've seen many times now (thanks to films like this). Himuro Gemma is a large hulking handsome western-esque looking villain with a lantern jaw and almost invincible fighting skills (but he is a demon). Whereas Yurimaru is the typical calm but deadly handsome skinny villain who dresses all in white, has even longer flowing hair and looks almost religious. He is able to generate electricity through his body and conducts it down a steel wire he strangles people with. The other demons literally come across like a Capcom fighting roster. There's a ninja bloke who can utilise shadows. A sexy chick with living snake tattoos. A massive bloke who can turn his skin to stone. Another sexy chick who can manipulate gunpowder in all manner of weird ways. And a hunchback with a living hornet's nest in his back!In short almost everyone is very good looking with lovely straight flowing hair and great muscle structure that is either just right, hulking, or monstrous. At the same time there is also that typical exaggerated facial anime style where characters have extremely strong jaws, chiseled cheekbones, and long chins. Their features are basically very prominent...with perfect hair. Oh and everyone is really fit, even the people that don't look it. Can make you a bit self-conscious.As I've hinted at here and there, nowadays this film will come across as rather unoriginal. But that's only because many properties have more than likely been highly influenced by other properties that were originally influenced by this anime. You can spot so many ideas that will have popped up in so many flicks over the years, not to mention videogames. Hell this anime is almost like a 'Samurai Shodown' movie. That's not a bad thing, I love it! Overall the sizzling action sequences, hyper turbo characters, and absolutely gorgeous artwork and animation are just so good and engaging I can't not give this a perfect score. Thoroughly enjoyed every minute of this. A true cult classic, an all-round epic, a work of art.10/10",

Ninja Scroll is not for kids! It has extreme scenes of gore, blood, violence and is sexually suggestive. It deals with a wandering ronin named Jubei who suddenly has a key moment in his past come back to haunt him. From that point on this roller coaster of a movie begins. Its dark, fast paced, and with sparse dialogue from the main character you know his mindset is less talk, more action.Along with Akira and Ghost in the Shell these movies paved the way and introduced new fans to the anime genre. I'm really happy a sequel was never made, it wouldn't make sense. An effort was made at spin-offs that were below par and unengaging. The original remains the only one you need to see. A masterpiece!",

The plot has more twists and turns than your average anime slashing flick and enough to give your system a good adrenaline flush. It is a rather bloody movie, but I would not call it gratuitously violent - somebody had to chop people up, right? There are only 2 and remarkably low-key sex scenes which is a welcomed change from some other anime titles (you all know what they are) bent on depicting in needles anatomical detail endless alien/devil rape scenes... This movie is a must for anime fans as well as for those who want to be introduced to this genre - I'd highly recommend Ninja Scroll over Sailor Moon, if you know what I mean.",

His fearsome abilities have served him well, but a hideous plot to overthrow the government threatens to end his wandering ways and possibly his life. When a small village succumbs to a terrible plague, a team of ninjas are sent to investigate and realize that all is not as it seems. Ambushed, they are wiped out by a fearsome man-monster with incredible powers., leaving only one alive - Kagero, a beautiful female ninja whose touch can bring instant death. Jubei saves her from a fate worse than death and unwittingly becomes drawn into a web of treachery. He is soon faced with his greatest challenge, an enemy for whom death holds no fear with the power to destroy Jubei's world. It's an all-out bloodbath when ninja warriors come face to face in this action-packed tribal war. Ninja Scroll features a wicked cast of characters, extraordinary fight scenes and stunning animation from Yoshiaki Kawajiri and Madhouse Studios! My Spiel: Ninja Scroll is a feast of animation perfection. This is a blast to watch every time, from the sweet fight scenes and the sweet visual's this film has to offer. If you are looking for a Samurai/Ninja Anime search no further at only 94 minutes this is full of Adventure from start to finish. I can't say enough of how this movie blew me away after watching it in sync with Wicked City by the same Director. Granted this movie has a partial sexual content just so you know. But but don't let that discourage you, this anime does more then makes up for that with its fights against fantastically gifted enemies and visual aspects and fantastic ideas. Ninja Scroll with it's sweet top of the line animation is truly a joy to watch every time. Easily one of my top 10 favorite animes of all time.Ninja Scroll (1993) Review: 9/10",

I remember watching this years ago, it is now that I thought I'll add my opinion. Having just watched the anime, it still awes in animation quality.The story is based in Feudal Japan, with many ninja clans. There is an epidemic spreading, and rumours of the 8 ninjas from the Shogun of the dark clan have a secret agenda. The government and the locals clans are suspicious, so they start their own investigation. Jubei (our hero) is in the mix of all of this. Who meets up with Kegero, a survivor in the midst of the investigation.Jubei is the like-able, mysterious, lonesome warrior that really does not want to get involved. The 8 ninjas all have unique abilities, that create great action set pieces. One that can turn himself to stone, the ability to crawl into the shadows, and many other strange powers. Jubei and Kegero have to come against all of these foes and uncover the secret that are behind the Shogun of the Dark.Plot wise, is just enough to get the story going at a fast pace. To me it's like a mixture of Eastern background, with the premise of a Western action movie. It's really there to set up the action. So don't think of it as a great story, it's about character, situation and action.Animation is one of the best there is, though with the use of some flashing lights in backgrounds, (when in action shots,) looks a little cheap. It works. There is some nudity, which I felt wasn't really necessary, but could be needed to boost a higher certificate rating. As this is a very violent movie.The movie does move very fast, and it seems it wants to create a showdown for each of the 8 ninjas in the Shogun of the Dark. At times I felt they could have milked them a bit more, but it stands very well as a 94 minute movie.Overall it is visually a great piece of art, and has started it's own genre. With many spin offs that does not live up to expectations, like Sword for Truth, for one. It is great melodrama at it's best. A movie that could only be animated, and never be a live action.A-",

            "content": "Six years ago, I took a film class in college taught by P. Admas Sitney, probably the most cynical and critical man I've ever met in my life. At that time I was watching a lot of anime, and after watching NINJA SCROLL on videocassette, I arranged an appointment with Professor Sitney one sunny afternoon to see what he'd have to say about it.Have you ever watched anime, I asked him. Since he hadn't I lent him my copy of NINJA SCROLL and spent one week wondering to myself whether he'd watch it or not. The following week, he handed me back the video and said, \"It's garbage.\" I was stunned, but he gave me one reason why he thought it was no good. Hollywood, he said, has abandoned the idea of hard eye-straining work. CGI has taken over since the days of Steamboat Willie, and the idea is more money and technology to save on blood sweat and tears. \"That is one of the many problems with modern animation and it is specifically the problem with the video you hold in your hands.\" I was so disappointed that I didn't bother to ask him to comment on Japanese culture (although he did screen RASHOMON in his class), and I was depressed for all of two hours before I found something other to do than sulk on a sunny afternoon.Six years later, I cannot agree with Sitney more. 99 out of 100 anime's in the Japanese market are shot at a choppy 1.0 frames per second and give you a strobe light headache. As for popular animation in Japan, you'll find nothing but Pixar dotting the shelves of your local Tsutaya or Geo video stores. Even the big-name anime's will only get five cover boxes at the most, which all lie in the shadow of hundreds upon hundreds of NEMOS.NINJA SCROLL is very good, and you know, Sitney probably remembers our little visit and parts of the movie. Maybe. The movie features plenty of graphic violence, ninja spirit, and an mediocre storyline. Probably the best part about the movie is its Big Trouble in Little China style team of demons, each one with a quirky power like turning into an army of monkey heads or something. That's the good part. The bad part is that 70 percent of it is very stilted and jilted animation which is too much for an 80 minute production. That being said, please watch NINJA SCROLL and get back to me which you like better, conventional Disney CGI or 0.01 fps hand drawn strobe light.

The voice dubbing was well done, although I'm sure that the Japanese version was better (everything's better in Japanese!), and I didn't find the liberal use of blood to be all that distracting. Sure, sometimes it seems like their bodies were a geyser, or something, but it wasn't TOO extreme, compared to some other things I've seen.All in all, I'd recommend you see this movie, it's more of a Jackie Chan flick than a Matrix epic, but they're both good, so why not see some nice and fun action? 9/10.",

            "content": "Yoshiaki Kawajiri's Ninja Scroll (1993) is a stunning, animated fantasy adventure, set during the feudal period of Japanese history, and focusing on a renegade assassin forced to take on a clan of mystical samurai warriors with supernatural, or indeed, superhuman abilities. For me, it is one of the most memorable and rewarding Anime films that I have ever seen, and yet another success for the prolific and highly talented Kawajiri; a director whose notable credits include Wicked City (1987), Hell City Shinjuku (1988) and Cyber City Oedo 808 (1990). The world of Ninja Scroll could be seen as a direct continuation of the worlds of Wicked City and Hell City Shinjuku, with monsters and demons invading a seemingly naturalistic environment and subverting it, whilst simultaneously offering us a film rich in character, action and convincing period detail.The story is full of texture and information, while still managing to find room to pander to the genre's prevalent notions of sexual violence and gore; as limbs are hacked off in jet-streams of blood and characters engage in brilliantly rendered scenes of balletic swordplay, magic-tricks and martial arts. If you're a fan of Kawajiri and of Anime in general then this will appeal, but even so, the style of the film and the world that the filmmakers create is seriously impressive, even for someone unfamiliar with this particular animated sub-genre. I certainly wouldn't class myself as an Anime expert, but I love film, and will generally watch anything, especially animation. If you think a film like this is simply for adolescent boys, you're very much mistaken. The creation of this world shows real skill and imagination, while the overall direction of the characters and the narrative are seriously out of the world.The design of the film reminded me very much of a particular style of Japanese cinema prevalent in the 1960's, when elements of history, folklore, theatre and expressionism were combined to produce ethereal, other-worldly and incredibly stylish supernatural dramas like for example Kaneto Shind\u014d's Onibaba (1964), or perhaps more directly, Masaki Kobayashi's epic, slow-burning masterwork Kwaidan (1964). Like Kwaidan, Ninja Scroll exists in a carefully created, abstract fantasy world of vivid colours and intangible images. These images both tell and propel the story, pushing us further from one vibrant, violent and imaginative fight-sequence to the next as we are introduced to a number of notable characters, from a seductive female assassin whose lethal snake tattoos literally come to life, to a giant man-mountain murderer seemingly made of stone.By the end of the film we start to see elements of political intrigue and corruption developing alongside the historical and supernatural themes, and a depiction of literal inferno of revenge and retribution. Granted, most of these themes can be taken as window-dressing to pad out the scenes of violence and combat, but you could probably level the same criticisms at films like Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon (2000) and Kill Bill (2003-2004). I often wonder why so many supposedly serious film fans are snooty when it comes to animation? For me, it presents cinema at its most limitless and pure; a world of possibilities where anything is possible. Just look at Jubei's fight with the blind swordsman in the forest for instance to see an absolutely peerless use of movement, sound, colour and composition. True, it might not be an absolute classic masterpiece, but it is, regardless, a great piece of work.",

However, despite feeling like a video game, this film deserves such very high rating (8/10) because it is an almost flawlessly executed pure action movie: it is perhaps the ultimate video-game film. :)If Tarkovsky is the French wine, this is the junk food for film buffs.

Nothing in it really touched me or excited me. Generally I love anime, and most of the movies ( animated ) with high marks, turn to be quite good, or at least worthy.The plot is very straightforward, without any interesting deviations or occurrences that could make me be excited.My overall impression of that movie was that everything in it is fictional. There is nothing that connects those characters to real people ( ninjas or other warriors ). This is what I think this movie lacked the most; the detailing, that make the characters less animated, even though they have unnatural powers.There's a lot of mystics, but there is no reality, and mystics alone looses its magic when it can't be compared. Mystics should thrill us, and take us with the gravity of the unknown and the unexplained. But instead, here, it is a casual thing, without any explanations, just to get the plot together.Maybe, It's because of the movie's explicit sex scenes and blood, that others rate it so high, but I just can't find it satisfying enough.I really got disappointed from Ninja Scroll, because I had high expectations about it ( as I explained above ). Maybe seeing it without such an expectation, if the movie's credits weren't so high, I would be less disappointed and rate it appropriately. But then again, I wouldn't probably see it. There's a lot of great anime, and in my opinion this one is far from scratching their middle. Skip this.",

            "content": "You gotta love Yoshiaki Kawajiri.  He knows exactly what he wants and manages to achieve it in almost every anime he makes.  A Kawajiri film almost always has sex, monsters, gore, cynical or dillusioned heroes, and tons of style with absolutely no substance to back it up.  He's like a diseased little second grader, with no real grasp of human psychology but a brilliant understanding of how to make a mindless, purely entertaining film.Ninja Scroll is probably his best work to date.  Its animation is detailed and beautiful, its story lurid and engaging (though somewhat predictable), its monsters terrifying and well designed.  You'll never forget the rock monster or the guy with the wasp nest on his back or the immortal Himuro Gemma.  What sets this apart from Kawajiri's other films, though, is the complex male/female relationship at the core of the story.  Sure, a guy and a girl mistrusting each other at first but eventually falling in love isn't exactly anything new, but it works surprisingly well here.  This is a movie where a guy literally has to make love to an incredibly beautiful nude woman to save his own life, but chooses NOT to because it wouldn't be right.  It's an amazing scene that shows a tremendous degree of restraint on Kawajiri's part, and it brings striking depth and emotion to what would otherwise have been a completely empty movie.If you can stomach the gore and a pretty nasty rape scene, you'll probably enjoy Ninja Scroll.  It's a great little guilty pleasure film, well animated and full of great action sequences.  Pop it in late at night after a really stressful day.  It'll make you feel like a diseased little second grader all over again.",

At that time I was pretty close minded about the whole thing, and I guess that is a bit degrading but there is more to this movie than just that.Basically a village is infected with a plague and a group of ninja are sent to investigate and are all killed by a huge demon. Slowly the plot untwists to reveal what was going on but I really cannot go too deep into this because I really do not want to spoil it for you. Though it turns out to be pretty ordinary, there are only a limited amount of secret conspiracies that one can do so it comes down to how it is executed as opposed to what it is, and I think the execution is actually quite well done.I guess the thing that makes Manga stand out is the freedom that one has when creating animated features as opposed to normal features. Here we have some rather horrific looking creatures that the heroes confront, including a ninja that strikes from the shadows and a huge rocklike creature that could easily crush a normal human in one of its hands. The animation is also very smooth and a lot of effort has gone into it.The main aspect that stands out is the tragic element to this movie. The main characters slowly become attracted to each other but the problem is that the woman is poisoned. She is immune to her own poison, but if she has sex with anybody else they will be killed by the poison. That literally creates a rift between her and the rest of humanity as she could never truly love anybody because everybody whom she comes close to will reach a point were they will die. As such she distances herself from everybody else, though the main character continues to try to worm his way into her life, not because he wants to sleep with her, but rather because he wants to work with her.Beyond the plot, the movie is well made and the story is very well constructed, creating a relationship that is ultimately terminal. There is only so far that they can go, but there is another hand that keeps on trying to manipulate it. In the end, this movie works out well, leaving us with an empty feeling regarding this lost relationship.",

            "content": "\"Ninja Scroll\" is an action/anime made in 1993 by Yoshiyaki Kawajiri. This film is set in the feudal Japan.Basic plot: A wandering samurai named Jubei Kipagami, who originally served the Yamashiro clan for years ago, is traveling on the land alone. People in a small village have died by a mystical plague, so a team of ninjas is sent to investigate the case, only to get brutally killed one by one by a rock creature named Tessai. The only survivor, the beautiful Kagero, gets raped and blood poisoned by Tessai. But Jubei saves her and kills Tessai, and sets out to annihilate a group called the Eight Devils of Kimon lead by the demonic Gemma Himuro.Throughout this film, there are lots of sword violence and several supernatural violence, which often get bloody result. This is enough to keep the mature fans of Japanese animation and ninjas interested. The soundtrack fits well in many of these scenes, especially during Tessai's attack and the ending scenes. The animation and the graphics itself are beautifully made, and so are the scenes with Jubei and Kagero together.This film is the fourth 18-rated anime I've seen after \"Shadow Skill\", \"Venus Wars\" and \"Akira\", well this film was at least rated 18 in Norway when released on VHS by Polygram Video. Like the other three anime movies I mentioned, this film was also English dubbed, but not subbed in Norwegian. On the Norwegian DVD copy I have, this film has been heavily toned down from being 18 to being rated 10 (!), something I just didn't like because of the fact all the nudity and the gory violence are intact on this DVD edition. In my opinion this film should have gotten at least a 15-rating.Are you a fan of ninjas and anime in general but haven't seen \"Ninja Scroll\", I suggest you to check out this film at least once. Honestly, this have to be one of the better ninja anime I've seen, together with the \"Naruto\" franchise. My overall rating for this film is therefore 9/10.Some of the other movies from Yoshiyaki Kawajiri to be mentioned include: \"Wicked City\" (1987), \"Demon City Shinjuku\" (1988) and \"Vampire Hunter D: Bloodlust\" (2000).",

The animation of the combatantsin the fluid environment is exquisite.  Secondly, the animation inthe duel between Utsutsu and Jubei is unparalleled.

The different adversaries and their abilities are entertaining and creatively conceived.The story and structure however are not very original.

And the main character: a lone wolf facing off adversaries, until he eventually gets to the top guy (with whom he shares a dark past).

Yet, with all this \"great\" aspects, the story line was weaker that I would have liked, the direction was very noticable and the events were mostly predicatable.Even though the story line fell short of par in my league, I was still pathetically entertained by the very excitement of this ninja hack-n-slash film, and would recommend it, but would not give it all the hype that it recieved.",

            "content": "If this movie is worth seeing at all, it's to give you a perspective on how low-brow the majority of denizens of this horrible, horrible world are. Ninja Scroll neatly embodies all the worst things about anime, and through its popularity is greatly responsible for the negative stereotypes about anime held by the US mass media.Ninja Scroll belongs to the 'ultraviolent' class of anime, in which it is common for a sword wound to gush approximately 150 gallons of blood.  In order for a body to hold this much blood, it must be stored in an extremely high pressure gaseous state, because whenever someone is cut they emit an 8 foot high geyser of blood.  Of course ridiculous gore isn't enough to please Ninja Scroll's upscale cadre of fans, so the \"film\"-makers cleverly added copious amounts of sex to keep their attention.  And while many anime movies include so-called \"fan service\", Ninja Scroll uses less subtlety than a 1970's french porno movie directed by Larry Flynt and Wilt Chamberlain. Now you may be thinking, \"Superfluous sex and violence? How can this movie possibly go wrong?\" so let me continue to the discussion of the plot and acting.**Very Minor Spoilers** [Note: It's not possible to -spoil- Ninja Scroll] Ninja Scroll follows the basic plotline used by many serial comicbooks(or graphic novella if you prefer).  Mysterious-Swordsman-Wanderer-Guy with fantastic skills and an unknown past appears and uses his fighting skills to beat Evil-Ugly-Brute-Guy.  Mysterious-Ancient-Sage-Guy shows up and tells M-S-W-G that he needs defeat Super-Evil-Strong-Devil-Boss.  M-S-W-G reluctantly agrees, and he and M-A-S-G go on their quest to defeat S-E-S-D-B, occasionally aided by Pointless-Ninja-Girl-Sex-Object.  Along the way they meet many powerful hyphenated enemies serving S-E-S-D-B, who are defeated by M-S-W-G[note: from now on I'll just refer to him as Jubei{note-in-a-note: Jubei's character is supposedly 'based on' the famous Japanese warrior Yagyo Jubei, however their only connection is the name}]. I'm sure you can figure out the rest of the storyline by yourself. **End of Spoilers**Although the enemies are all based on previous anime cliches(just how many guys with invisible razor strings are there in the world?) they still remain interesting foes for Jubei to face.  The major problem is that there are just so many of these boss-type enemies that each of Jubei's showdowns with them last about 15 seconds or less after the enemy gets done introducing their special powers.  Likewise, the story skips from fight to fight with little to no story/character building in between.  This turns out to be a blessing in disguise, as the acting in this movie is abysmal.  I've only seen the dubbed version of Ninja Scroll, so these comments do not reflect the original Japanese voice acting.  Being that this movie was released in the US in 1995, it's not surprising that the voice acting is flat and lackluster.  Only recently have we started seeing quality dubbed anime(like the excellent Sol Bianca: The Legacy).  With a pure action movie such as Ninja Scroll, good voice acting is not expected, or really needed. However, there is little excuse for the poorly written english dialogue.  Catering to its expected audience, the dub is full of stupid, unnecessary profanity, presumably to make it seem more edgy.  It should be noted that with one exception, there are no profane words in Japanese, so a proper translation should only contain profanity to express extreme emotions.  To round out my critique I should say that the animation quality is not as good as some movies released in the same time period(Ghost in the Shell), it is still pretty decent.In closing, let me say that I'm constantly disgusted by the number of people who rate this Ninja Scroll as their favorite anime.  As an anime fan you should probably watch this at least once, if only to see what the fuss is about.  If you ARE a fan of Ninja Scroll and similar anime, let me give you this advice.  Watch Berserk, then watch Rurouni Kenshin first OVA(Samurai X: Romantic Tales of the Meiji Era in the US), then watch Record of Lodoss War, then Vision of Escaflowne.  By then you should be have been slowly weaned over from ultraviolent anime.  If not, take my other advice and jump into a deep pit.4/10 on quality 1/10 on principle",

            "content": "\"Ninja Scroll\" is a story told so confusingly it makes you think it is much more complicated than it is. Is that the point? You get sparse plot details in the first few minutes which aren't explained until an hour later. By that stage, you can't remember the beginning details, or you don't care.Perhaps as a result the movie feels much longer than it is, at only an hour and a half. The sparse details make you feel like you are watching an epic, when actually, the plot is pretty basic.It is something to do with a battle between ninja teams and a \"vagabond\" caught in the middle. On one side, the ninja are all superhuman or supernatural beings, with abilities such as turning their bodies to stone, generating electricity and being able to hide in shadows. The movie is, really, just a series of fantastic fight scenes, but I kept coming back to the confusing plot.But there is only one reason why anybody watches \"Ninja Scroll\", and I'm aware it's not the plot. It's the action scenes, and they are impressive. \"Ninja Scroll\" is one of few animations I've seen that is sickening in its violence. There are scenes I can't watch, with limbs being torn from bodies by blood-drinking golems and faces being headbutted in.There is also a fairly misogynistic streak in the film you might detect. The female lead, and love interest to the protagonist, is the victim of sexual violence not once but twice. Aside from that the only female character in this movie is spurned by her gay love interest.",

Aside from the whole selling point of the anime for me is the action, the story is pretty generic and the violence against women may come to super-exploited level but compare to an unhealthy amount of trashy Isekai anime that been spit out by the industry right now the sheer brutality and gritty of the anime actually make me appreciated it more over time. If you tired of all the wishy-washy PG-13 of current anime then try Ninja Scroll because it may not be the best anime you've ever seen but it will definitely help refresh your mind",

For awhile, I almost gave up on anime because a lot of it sucked(I don't care for the violent sex and super-intense gore that pervades through many of these movies).But I happened to come across Ninja Scroll.This movie is excellent. The story is exciting,the characters interesting, and the art amazing! The main character Jubei is surprising as far as Japanese animation is concerned. He is cool, calm,slow to violence but quick to resolution. He actually has a heart and cares for others, and is willing to risk his life for friends and a noble cause. The villains are terrific(a hero is only as good as the villain). Truly menacing and threatening.At certain points in the movie you will actually wonder \"how will he get out of this one?\",and the relationship Jubei shares with the female ninja Kagero is touching and ultimately heartbreaking(and believe it or not, it's tasteful). He doesn't see Kagero as a sex object as would be the norm in Anime, but as a equal and as a friend.Of course it is violent and there are a couple of gratuitous sex scenes, but the overall package is beyond value. Next to Ghost In The Shell and Battle Angel as masterpieces.NOTE please view with engilsh sutitles. If you are like me you'll appreciate Anime that much more when the actual japanese actors do the voices.",

He is the man, very dude-like without all the white Russian's and he wields his sword with such ki that akido masters, jedi knights, and Lar Ulrich would be impressed with his full accentuation of force. He's beyond the \"lone\" mysterious figure, the one who--as my film professor once coined--\"drops a turd in the punch bowl,\" Juebi is larger than that. I'd put my chips on Juebi if it was Spiderman or Daredevil (wait, maybe not, if Matt Murdock was being payed by Assfleck, then yes), and a whole other slew of video game/comic book characters...maybe not Bugs Bunny, but Fog Horn Leg Horn for sure.

Ninja Scroll is not an anime you wear proudly on your shoulder.But it is one of the better bad anime out there. Its so over-the-top in its gore and sleaze, its impossible to not laugh. The eight evil villains are a blast - they're less ninjas, and more X-men. They're very powerful and unique, but our hero always manages to survive. The action is pretty sweet. I had to rewind because the first scene was so fast, yet so busy! Add some good animation, and you've got action that never gets old.Do not expect a great anime going in, or you'll cringe at the awful dialog and rape scenes.

Unfortunately, Ninja Scroll is a big steaming pile of tosh. You'd find more plot depth and character development in an episode of Pokemon, which, in a way, is what this closely resembles. Only with more decapitations. On the plus side I guess it fulfils most of the stereotypes for this kind of thing: gallons of blood spraying out of peoples necks, magical creatures, naive love story, etc. What almost saved the experience for me though was the unintentionally funny DVD extras; first an 'inside the actors studio' with two of the American voice artists:''What preparation do you do for your roles?'' ''I get in my car and drive to the studio.''And an interview with an obviously harassed and irritated director:Apparently serious interviewer: ''Was it your intention to realistically portray female lifestyles in feudal era Japan?''

While not considered one that raises consciencous \"issues\" like Akira, Ghost in the Shell, or Grave of the Fireflies, Ninja Scroll is absolutely guaranteed to entertain.This anime involves some of the best and bloodiest battle scenes ever seen, and the eight devils of Kumon are among the most memorable villains known to anime. However, the ending battle was kind of a letdown after the unique and exciting fare dealt up by the eight devils",

One strong theme is the role of women in Japan's Tokogawa period and the near absurdity (at the time) of a woman ninja.  By taking a man's role, Kegaro denies herself her very gender in the presence of others, as seen in her waiting for Jubei to go down the road before breaking down emotionally after being raped by the demon, and holding her tongue through concrete-thick tension when giving her report to the Duke as he makes \"love\" to a geisha.  There is also a theme of continuance as the film both opens and closes with Jubei travelling to his original destination.  All in all a very well done piece and worth rewatching.",

The characters have a wonderful and realistic personal development, they have extremely humane lows and highs, the fights are literally impeccable and often happen so fast you'll need to replay the scene to fully understand\n(blind samurai scene). All of this is topped on the absolutely amazing artwork that would probably be a global hit even if it appeared today, in 2022. I can't believe such beautiful art was created in 1993 when I was still swimming around balls, but so was the world back then. Movies were created for art, and to send a message, not just for profit, like today. I HIGHLY recommend you this movie, alongside Vampire Hunter D, Trigun, Cowboy Bebop, and Ergo Proxy.",

The action and animation really sets this apart from many animes. A lot of them suffer from a severe amount of static images or repeat animations, but this one was well animated and engaging to look at.Ninja Scroll probably isn't going to suddenly make a believer out of a non-anime fan but it's definitely one of the better ones and a good place to start if you're interested.",

Still, the fight scenes are done well and the villains have several different unique abilities.There's also a brief sex scene, and nearly two rape scenes.  It's stuff like this that gives the rest of animation a bad rep.  Although the special trait of the 'ninja girl' is a curious twist, I'm afraid I'm not too fond of the story.On the plus side, it doesn't try too hard to teach morals or have a point. It's the story of two warriors, for better or worse.  I wouldn't suggest this movie, what with the extreme violence on one end and extreme sexuality on the other.",
