            "review_title": "Tarantino's most \"personal\" writing; Scott gives commendable direction to all-stars",
            "content": "True Romance is the work of two men, known for making movies (as TBS would say) for guys who like movies, and have one of the pick of the litter in the genre from the early to mid nineties. Quentin Tarantino sold his script to fund Reservoir Dogs, and Tony Scott (Top Gun) got picked up to direct. Some have complained that Tarantino should've directed this film, that it's so much his (which I agree with considering the story of the film was taken from his 1987 experimental film My Best Friend's Birthday, which refers to Clarence in this film going to the Sonny Chiba movies) that his own style as a director would've complimented it. It's a nice thought, though that's not what we as the audience are left with, and so with the final product there is much to admire about the style that Scott uses in the film. He films Tarantino's script (from a Roger Avary script originally) very much like he's shooting a Hollywood movie (as he knows how to with DP Jeffrey Kimball), with all the cut-aways and editing timing that is expected in a conventional crime-drama-thriller, then by hearing the snapping dialog from the script, and the cast performing them, Scott does become an important piece of making True Romance a success.The story is a throwback to the old 'lovers on the run' formula, among others- Clarence (Christian Slater in one of his finest) is an employee in a comic book store in Detroit, loves kung-fu movies and big guns and such, who gets set up unwittingly with a call girl named Alabama (Patricia Arquette). The two fall in love, and Clarence feels confident enough by a certain voice in the back of his head (provided by Val Kilmer) to go and free Alabama for good from her vile pimp and drug dealer Drexl (Gary Oldman in one of the better villain roles of the time). He does, and through a couple of accidents Clarence and Alabama wind up with millions worth in cocaine, and high-tail it to LA to sell it, as the original (mob) owners of the coke follow after, with explosive results.For fans of the actors, in particular the supporting cast, True Romance is one of the treats of treats in modern movies, on par with Pulp Fiction's roster of know-ables: Christopher Walken as a gangster (who would've thought?), Brad Pitt as a stoner roommate, Tom Sizemore and Chris Penn as cops, a few good lines for Samuel L. Jackson, an early plum for James Gandolfini, and my personal favorite of the lot, Dennis Hopper as Clarence's ex-cop father. Another thing that makes True Romance one of the (dare I say) most accessible of Tarantino's works is that a viewer who might not know this is his work on first viewing (this was me a few years ago, sad to say) will stay tuned through the whole thing if it's on TV just because of the star power; indeed, before Oldman's Detrix is introduced into the film, TR seems to flow like it'll be a romantic drama with light overtones. All I can say is by the end of this film, you will see that good taste can prevail no matter how much bloodshed gets on the screen, or how many obstacles get in the way of love (and Elvis!).",

            "content": "True Romance is a celebration of film.  It wallows in every possible seedy contrivance of American crime/action cinema.  It is absolutely shameless in its exploitation of excessive violence, over-acting, melodrama, lurid sex, and rampant drug use...I love it.  Quentin Tarantino, as I'm sure everyone knows, wrote the story, but it is the in execution that this film pays off. The cast, oh the cast:  The lynchpins are Christian Slater and Patricia Arquette.  They both give solid performances, which prevents the film from flying off the tracks; they serve as the pilot light.  The supporting roles are the gas.  The Walken/Hopper show down has been oft sighted as the film's best aspect, and this is, arguably, true.  Just watch this scene and then watch it again.  Sparks actually shoot out of the screen and burn people about the head and shoulders.  OK, you've got Val Kilmer as the ghost of Elvis, Brad Pitt as a disgruntled pot-smoking loser, Tom Sizemore & Chris Penn as cops, James Gandolfini (pre-Sopranos) as a reflective hitman, and you've even got Bronson Pinchot (from TV's PERFECT STRANGERS) for God's sake. Did I forget Gary Oldman? Do yourself a favor and rent every single Gary Oldman related project (they're not all good films, but...).  Why is Gary Oldman not in every film ever made? Why? I ask you why?  He has got to be the best actor working today, hands down.  As Drexel Spivey, Oldman chews the scenery, digests it, and then expels it from every orifice.  Keep in mind that he is an English actor with a normal speaking voice at home in the Royal Shakespeare Company.  His performance here is second only to his turn in LEON in blatant over-the-top insanity. Tony Scott, who along with his brother Ridley, has been known to over-direct a film or two, here chooses wisely to basically set up the camera and run.  The score by Hans Zimmer adds a bouncy xylophone driven theme to the film and finds the right balance. This a well made, balls-to-the-wall, popcorn throwing, cult classic.  In a market dominated with stereotypical characters, this movie avoids that trap by letting the stereotypes flourish with all the grotesque absurdity it can muster. 9/10",

            "content": "Cynical, seen-it-all-before smart ass that I am, I can't but help love 'True Romance'! On paper it looks like a sure fire recipe for disaster. A typically hip pop-culture saturated Quentin Tarantino script directed by schlockmeister Tony Scott, the man responsible for rancid Simpson/Bruckheimer \"blockbusters\" like 'Top Gun' and 'Days Of Thunder'. But some how it really works! The movie is especially helped by a dynamite cast, one of the most impressive in many years. Possibly only Julian Schnabel's underrated biopic 'Basquiat' can rival its mixture of star power and cult faves. Slater, Arquette, Walken, Hopper, Oldman, Kilmer, Penn, Sizemore, Jackson, Rapaport, Gandolfini, Argo, Corrigan, etc.etc. These are many of the finest actors working today. Add them to an electric story of love on the run, jam packed with amusing, highly quotable dialogue and plenty of action and laughs, and you have yourself a genuinely entertaining update of a classic 70s drive-in movie. 'True Romance' is a wild ride not to be missed!",

            "review_title": "Great mix of comedy, romance, and thrills",
            "content": "A fresh and exciting crime thriller which mixes romance with the old-fashioned gangster antics that writer Quentin Tarantino is best known for. This is a hugely satisfying movie, well-directed by Ridley Scott's brother Tony, and with some fine cinematography which really comes out in the excellent action sequences. Despite the onslaught of screen violence and bad language, the strong, old-fashioned story is what keeps this watchable and entertaining throughout and it's nice to watch a film which doesn't take its audience for granted.As well as the catchy tune that plays throughout, TRUE ROMANCE is blessed with an ensemble cast who help to bring out the various character nuances. Christian Slater is here, doing his young man Jack Nicholson stuff, yet he's never been more likable than he is now. Similarly Patricia Arquette's hooker-with-a-heart is an endearingly \"cute\" character that you can't help but warm to despite her many faults. Dennis Hopper is on hand as Slater's father, excelling in a torture sequence which expertly mixes comedy with graphic horror to great effect. Endearing comic character support comes from Bronson Pinchot as the dim-witted go-between to whom Slater tries to sell the drugs and Michael Rapaport as Slater's goofy wannabe-actor brother, Dick. Unforgettably evil are Gary Oldman and Christopher Walken as the villains of the piece, whilst minor roles are filled out by the familiar faces of Chris Penn, Samuel Jackson, Brad Pitt, and Val Kilmer, who has a weird Elvis-inspired role as Slater's imaginary \"mentor\".Two superbly-crafted sequences stand out in my mind after watching this movie - the first is an exchange in the hotel in which Arquette is systematically beaten and tortured by one of Walken's sadistic henchman, looking for his cocaine. The moment in which the worm finally turns and Arquette fights back is more violent than in your average gore slasher, yet the scene is just so powerfully done with so much atmosphere that its unforgettable. Then there's the finale which involves a shoot-out to end all shoot-outs, and what can I say but \"eat your heart out John Woo!\". Excellent stuff. Any film fan should watch TRUE ROMANCE to find out how such a thriller should be made.",

The gorgeous Alabama Whitman (Patricia Arquette) accidentally drops her popcorns on Clarence and they watch the movie together. Then they eat pieces of pie and they have one night stand. On the dawn, Alabama confesses that she is a call-girl hired by his boss and friend to spend the night with him, but she has fallen in love with him. In the morning they get married and Clarence goes to the club where she worked to bring her clothes. However her pimp Drexl Spivey (Gary Oldman) and his partner beat up Clarence that reacts killing them both. Clarence asks to the other girls to give Alabama's suitcase with her clothes and they mistakenly give another one with cocaine.When Clarence discovers the mistake, he decides to travel with Alabama to the house of his friend, the aspirant actor Dick Ritchie (Michael Rapaport), to sell the drug in Los Angeles and then travel to Mexico. He visits his father Clifford Worley (Dennis Hopper) and gives his address to him. But the Sicilian Mafia is the owner of the drug and a group of killers is hunting down Clarence and Alabama.\"True Romance\" is a great cult movie written by Quentin Tarantino and directed by Tony Scott. Patricia Arquette and Christian Slater show a wonderful chemistry and have top-notch performances and the supporting cast is impressive. The movie has a non-stop action and is excellent even after watching many times. My vote is eight.Title (Brazil): \"Amor \u00e0 Queima Roupa\" (\"Love at Close Range\")",

Coming after 'Reservoir Dogs', Quentin was still an unknown quantity. I loved the wild dialog but didn't know anything about Quentin when I first saw this. Christopher Walken and Dennis Hopper have a crazy exchange. I remember sitting up and taking notice like a new voice has come to American cinema. It's years later when I noticed Tarantino's name as the writer and it all makes sense. A name is given to the voice. Would you do Elvis if your life depended on it?",

How I didn't see this movie in the cinemas in the early 90s when I was going to the movies every week is a mystery to me, even moreso that I never saw it on VHS or TV, when it's a very famous film with some big names on both sides of the camera. Fortunately, I could rectify this mistake watching it last week in its new 4K HDR restored version projected on a big screen, and oh, boy! What a movie this one is! The 90s were the decade most obsessed with coolness since the 30s and few films lived up to be really cool then and even less now, but this early script by Tarantino and Avary (the wonderful couple) with the stylist direction of the superb Tony Scott, the brilliant soundtrack by Hans Zimmer and an unbelievable cast that throws big names without stop, not only in the leads but in every little role (including a young and powerful James Gandolfini), is one of the coolest movies of the decade and a truly deserving classic.",

            "content": "With at least 12 `starring actors' in character and supporting rolls, half of them legends or mega stars; this Tarantino tale defies a short review.  The different levels on which this movie works are impressive. As a love story we begin to believe that the quirky `loser' couple is unconditionally bound together.  As a pseudo `film noir' we begin to care about the fate of the central characters.  In the suspense/thriller/crime drama mode there are plenty twists and turns to push us to the edge and pull us back just in time.  The action scenes are deliciously violent and unlike most other films, this one gives us pinches of humor sprinkled in amidst the mayhem.   Even `the King' alter ego is woven in credibly enough to improve our understanding of the Clarence Worley character.The plot, albeit original, fresh and mesmerizing, seems somehow secondary to the characters and the characterizations.  Any of several rolls could have been performed over the top by what seemed to be an ensemble cast. But director Scott lets the talent go just far enough. Even the remainder of the supporting cast is wonderful; Saul Rubinek in particular does a terrific job as the puffed-up/ego-feeding movie producer.  Hollywood missed giving this movie and its cast proper recognition.With enough memorable scenes and talented stars to fuel a half a dozen blockbusters, True Romance gives us the `best bang for our buck' in years. The Walken/Hopper scene alone is worth the `price of admission' not to mention the Gandolfini/Arquette and Slater/Oldman match ups.  This can only be described as a `wonderfully wicked movie' for its tantalizing content, smart dialog and toothsome violence.Put the kiddies to bed, be prepared for rough language, adult themes and graphic violence and enjoy a `not for the faint of heart' masterpiece.",

            "review_title": "10 reasons to state this is one of the greatest movies ever!",
            "content": "Sure, purely talking cinema, True Romance isn't the most perfect film ever made (it's not boring enough for that). But, when it comes to entertainment values and coolness, this motion picture yet has to find an equal. Any first viewing of True Romance will literally blow you away and repeated viewing will only prove that this is one mean, addictive film. Through the years, True Romance built up quite a status and it's immensely popular. Still, too often it's categorized as worthless violence and therefore I'll introduce to you 10 reasons why this film is just brilliant!1. True Romance was the first screenplay written by Quentin Tarantino\u0085Now, it's unquestionable that Tarantino is one of the most gifted writers in cinema ever and this first work of his excellently reflects his enthusiasm and talent. The protagonist \u0096 Clarence Worley \u0096 has a lot in common with Quentin's own personality and because of this; True Romance actually looks like one giant daydream/fantasy of an imaginative adolescent.2. The choice of Tony Scott as the director. Unlike Oliver Stone in Natural Born Killers, Scott didn't feel the need to oppress his own visual style in True Romance. Yet, he adds a little more flair than QT would himself, so what you get is some sort of explosive crossover between Reservoir Dogs and Top Gun. 3. The all-star Cast!!!! Man, would you look at that cast! Some of Hollywood's best performers of every generation are there. Some of them only have miniscule roles but their presence is an extra added value, anyway. Christian Slater, Patricia Arquette, Val Kilmer, Gary Oldman, Dennis Hopper, Christopher Walken, James Gandolfini, Brad Pitt, Michael Rapaport, Bronson Pinchot, Samuel L. Jackson, Chris Penn, Tom Sizemore, Victor Argo\u00854. Every single personality in True Romance is adorably eccentric and worth analyzing. Clarence and Alabama are the 'good guys', yet they're pretty messed up in their heads themselves. Basically, every person in this film is a self-centered weirdo driven by mad thoughts and insanity. As a result of this, superb and colorful dialogues are overwhelming you. Excellent, first-class quote material.5. The romantic on screen chemistry between Clarence and Alabama\u0085Even though the plot may seem extremely illogical and far-fetched, the love and devotion between these two feels sincere and intense. Their interactions and sexual escapades increase the viewer's involvement. 6. That one particular sequence\u0085 Fans certainly will know what I'm talking about now! A tour-de-force between two of the talented actors ever, resulting in a breath-taking climax. Walken and Hopper's acting almost burns holes in your TV-screen and you can almost feel the cigarette smoke prickling in your eyes. Guided by chilling classical music and shot beyond perfection, this surely is one of most intense sequences ever caught on tape. 7. The trivia elements and references towards other films. QT is an absolute film geek and he terrifically inserts his passion in his script. In many of the dialogues, the characters (Clarence in particular) constantly refer to cinema milestones like Rio Bravo, The Good, the Bad and the Ugly and Dr. Zhivago. True Romance also is one giant tribute to the King of Rock 'n Roll himself as Clarence is a dedicated Elvis admirer.8. The Soundtrack! Tarantino films always have blasting soundtracks and True Romance isn't an exception. The main theme is a brilliant instrumental song by Hans Zimmer while the rest of the soundtrack mixes classic oldies and modern songs. 9. The coolness! Simply put\u0085this just is one cool motion picture. Clarence Worley is cool! He drives a purple Cadillac, wears giant sunglasses and eats hamburgers right after killing a guy. That is COOL! The love of his life is equally cool. She's like the perfect woman who likes Kung-Fu movies, dresses sexy and really knows how to defend herself. When asked where to meet discretely, she playfully answers: 'in the roller coaster!' and that, my friend, is cool. 10. The violence! Last but certainly not least\u0085aren't we all a little excited to see massive, grotesque violence? Qua violence, True Romance definitely overtrumps your wickedest expectations. The film contains multiple memorable action sequences and, just when you think you've seen it all, there comes the grand finale! The final sequence is one major adrenalin-rushing shootout, leaving very few to the imagination. Fascinatingly photographed and fun to see. There you go\u0085 In case you haven't seen True Romance yet, I have no idea what else would convince you to see it. Changes are high this will be one of your personal favorites, for sure. There only is one little turnoff I should mention. True Romance recently got released on Special (double disc) Millennium edition but that was quite a disappointment. The extras don't really feature anything special. I was hoping to see some deleted scenes or something, but there only is a B-roll documentary and a couple of short interviews.",

You get your fill of guns, sex, style and pop-culture, and the usual array of celebrity cameos in a film that seems a whole lot more 'close'. Whereas Pulp Fiction felt like one long trailer, with every line razor-sharp and a load of hip music that made the film go so quickly, True Romance offers you the chance to savour every moment, as the film moves at a (slightly) slower pace. Enjoy the blazing finale, and just wonder how it might have turned out if Tarantino had got his hands on the camera...",

Not really, from a crazed white pimp who thinks he is black to mob types to undercover cops this couple is going to have a really hard time getting to the honeymoon. The film has lots of violence, some sex, and inexplicably Bronson Pinchot who at the time was still most known as the lovable Balki from the television show \"Perfect Strangers\". Well here he plays a guy who gets caught by the cops with some white powder on his nose and it is not from a doughnut. The film's best sequence to me though was the Christopher Walken and Dennis Hopper one. Great scene, I love how Hopper's character basically realizes what is going to happen to him so he does his best to insult Walken's character as a parting shot. Just wish both of them were in the movie a bit more, especially Walken who disappears from the film after this scene. I could have done without the Elvis ghost scenes, but aside from that I have a rather positive image of this movie despite the fact it is not something I typically care for.",

It punctuates Scott's own romantic, fairy-tale view of a story which should really represent a heightened-reality retelling of 'Bonnie and Clyde' - grim ending and all. 'True Romance (1993)' suffers from the usual problems that plague this writer's work, but is still a highly entertaining and brutal picture that shows off its astute pop-culture sensibilities, excruciatingly long moments of nail-biting tension and brilliantly explosive sequences of violence with pride. Plus, that 'Sicilian' scene really is as fantastic as everyone says. 8/10",

Not to mention TR has an all-star cast, but many contribute their finest work in this film.  Oldman, Arquette and Slater arguably give their best performances.  Christopher Walken's scene is nothing short of pure brilliance.  I loved him in \"The Dead Zone\" and \"The Deer Hunter\" as well as his brief appearance in \"Pulp\".  I was happy with the ending, and I'm glad it ended the way it did.  We've come to not expect that type of ending anymore.

            "content": "Take a look at the credentials of True Romance. Firstly, director Tony Scott - brother of Ridley - had made a series of visually hyper-active and ultra-violent action movies (Beverly Hills Cop II, Revenge, The Last Boy Scout). Secondly, writer Quentin Tarantino had penned and directed the ground-breaking Reservoir Dogs. Thirdly, the cast comprises of a gallery of supporting slimeballs played by edgy character-actors, each of whom had given the world some of THE unforgettable screen characters in their earlier films (Dennis Hopper, Gary Oldman, Christopher Walken, Val Kilmer, Ed Lauter, Bronson Pinchot). Anyone expecting True Romance to be a quiet, low-key, gentle crime caper would have to have spent their lives on Mars! True to the form of its blood-obsessed talents it is an energetic, foul-mouthed, relentlessly violent, curiously comical crime thriller which commands attention in spite of its intentional excesses.In Detroit, young comic book store worker Clarence Worley (Christian Slater) hooks up with a prostitute named Alabama (Patricia Arquette) at a late-night movie theatre. Within a few hours they are in love, and soon after that they get married. But Clarence still feels the urge to confront Alabama's pimp, the dreadlocked psycho Drexl (Gary Oldman), on the one hand so that he can claim back her suitcase full of personal belongings and on the other because deep down inside he wants to hurt the pimp's pride. Their confrontation turns ugly and Clarence ends up killing his vicious rival; afterwards he leaves the scene with what he believes is Alabama's suitcase, but it transpires later that he has walked away with a different suitcase containing a fortune in uncut cocaine. Clarence and Alabama skip town and head for Hollywood, hoping to offload the drugs onto a movie star or producer at a cut price. Unfortunately, both the cops and the drug kingpins are keen to get hold of the suitcase full of cocaine too, so they put men on Clarence's trail. Clarence meets up with his old pal Dick (Michael Rappaport), now a struggling bit player in Hollywood, who via a contact arranges a drug sale with an ace movie producer (Saul Rubinek). Unknown to each other the various parties who covet the coke-loaded suitcase draw nearer to a fatal, blood-drenched rendezvous in an LA hotel room from which no-one can expect to walk away alive....True Romance is full of terrific hard-boiled dialogue and comical pop culture references. Slater is brilliant in the leading role, as is Arquette as his likably weird wife, but it's the gallery of crooked supporting characters who rule this movie. Walken has a chilling one-scene cameo; Hopper is terrific as Clarence's estranged father; Brad Pitt turns up briefly as a totally spaced-out drug addict; and Oldman is instantly fearsome in his electrifying scenes as the sadistic pimp. Tony Scott piles up the body count with one stylishly violent scene after another, all set to a soundtrack that is a trash-culture aficionado's wet dream. All the cursing, blood-letting, sex, drugs and rock 'n' roll eventually lose their impact through sheer repetition, but even then there's still the acting and dialogue to fall back on. You may need to have an amoral streak - or certainly a degree of tolerance - to enjoy True Romance, but if you like your movies fast, mean and outrageously raw you'll probably have a blast.",

            "content": "Tarantino wrote an outstanding story/script and Tony Scott perfectly captured his vision on screen.True Romance is probably the best romance film I have ever seen, and the fact that Quentin Tarantino had something to do with it gives you the answer as to why. Ultra violent and seedy, you wouldn't expect anything less..., Tarantino seriously sprinkles some hardcore magic dust onto all of his projects creating the quality and style we are used to from him. Clarence Worley (Christian Slater) receives an unexpected gift for his birthday, a prostitute called Alabama Whitman (Patricia Arquette), but Clarence falls in love with Alabama and vows to free and marry her, he does so by confronting her pimp Drexl Spivey (Gary Oldman) and \"accidentally\" kills him. Clarence breaks the news to his new love and reveals he has succeeded in taking back her possessions from Drexl, but the contents of the suitcase aren't Alabama's possessions, it is a large quantity of cocaine. The couple agree to leave Detroit and travel to California with the drugs as Clarence's contact, Dick Ritchie (Michael Rapaport) can sell the drugs there. High-jinks and classic twists and turns ensue as the mob lead by Vincenzo Coccotti (Christopher Walken) want what they claim to be theirs (the cocaine) back. This leads to a rather hilarious scene between Walken and Dennis Hopper, filmed in vintage Tarantino style, having a comical discussion before Hopper is shot dead. Clarence and Alabama arrive in California where they meet Dick, his roommate Floyd (Brad Pitt) and a guy called Elliot (Bronson Pinchot), Elliot agrees to get rid of the drugs and makes the arrangements with Lee Donowitz (Saul Rubinek).At this stage in the film, there is a very aggressive fight, akin to domestic abuse between one of the mobsters played by the late James Gandolfini and Alabama. This scene can be upsetting to some viewers as Alabama is seriously knocked about and in a critical condition towards the end, her face is a mangled mess and her body is cut, bruised and bleeding; yet in a cinematic sense the scene is quite beautiful and one of the most famous in this very infamous film. True Romance is enjoyable because of the aforementioned \"magical Tarantino touch\" or MTT for short, the guy can take literally anything and turn it into gold, there's no other way to explain why this film is simply so good, the plot is simple, the whole story is simple, but it's how it's filled that counts, and True Romance fills its story with integrate little details, paying attention and making even its slower points or \"filler\" meaningful and enjoyable, this is something not a great deal of films bother with. Pop culture runs wild in True Romance, as it does in the equally enjoyable Pulp Fiction, the music, bright colours, tongue in cheek language and dialogue, it pulls no punches and holds nothing back for anyone, a complete and utter politically incorrect film. I was astounded by the amazing performance and work rate put in by Patrica Arquette, who could've guessed that in her younger days she really was a stunner? Perfect for the role of Alabama, her chemistry with Christian Slater was so convincing too, and his performance was one of my favourites of all his films. A cult classic in every sense, and a highly enjoyable film to boot, I could watch True Romance over and over and never grow tired, just brilliant!",

Yet, I cannot shake the idea that perhaps had I watched the film during the time of its release and not seen the other similar films that have been made since, I might have enjoyed 'True Romance' a bit more. 'True Romance' is very much a pulp fiction itself (no pun intended as Tarantino wrote the screenplay). It's got the hooker with a big heart, the 'nobody' who finds a reason to live, a fake Rastafarian pimp who thinks he's black, the mobster, the cops, blood, murder, violence, drugs....and there's enough energy to entice the viewer. I enjoyed the numerous Elvis references, the wicked humour, the dialogues, the characters and the performances. Tony Scott does a fine job as director. Christian Slater is great as the likable 'nobody' and Patricia Arquette is brilliant as sweet hooker Alabama. Christopher Walken, Dennis Hopper, Gary Oldman and James Gandolfini are outstanding.

True Romance was not a film that got dusted off in the midst of Tarantino fever and is not attempting to be \"Tarantino'esq\" in its direction. Actually this was the first script that he ever wrote. It was penned whilst he was working in a video and comic store in Amsterdam. He rented the apartment above- anybody who has seen this film will know the parallels with Clarence Worley. Tarantino was actually trying to get his work taken on at the time by some film companies and he requested Scott because he loved his early work. It is true that later on Tarantino kicked up a fuss because they altered the ending and he criticised Scott for making it too Hollywood. Clarence dies in the original script! Anyway Scott agreed to make both endings and let Tarantino watch them, Tarantino then conceded he preferred the new version. The film wasn't trying to be Tarantino-esq that part was just the authors input on the film which is not common when people are making films like Harry Potter as the author has no knowledge of film but it is very common when working with screenwriters! This film is the most romantic film i have ever seen, brilliant characters, amazing sound track, brilliant acting & the cast alone informs us that this is one of the best films ever made. Brad Pitt was asked to be a lead character in the film but was working on another at the time. Pitt wanted to be involved so badly that he flew in for a days shooting just to do 6 lines as room mate Floydd. \"and some cleaning products\" was ad-libbed! Just see this film.",

Tarantino who decided to split Natural born killers and True Romance scripts (which ere basically same script ) made terrifying job at it, but real star behind film is late Tony Scott. Without a doubt, this is best film Scott has ever made, and that can be seen in whole film, from cast to score and even ending which is best thing that Scott decided to do, despite Tarantino's wishes, but even Tarantino himself was pleased at the end of it. Scott gave himself into the film and created cult masterpiece that will never be forgotten. Cast is terrifying. Cristian Slater before he become second rate actor and Patricia Arquete had believable chemistry on screen which made whole film. Supporting cast including Gary Oldman ( In his best role ever put to screen), Christopher Walken, James Gandolfini, Denis Hopper not to mention others, made beautiful ensemble cast which was not very well known at the time, but today, they are all first class actors.

Christian Slater and Patricia Arquette both give Oscar worthy performances in their lead roles. True Romance has the perfect mix of great dialogue, romance, action and strong violence. Without spoiling the ending, what I really wanted from this film was a satisfying ending and it delivered %100. Some scenes will have you laughing out loud while others while have you on the edge of your seat with tension. I don't really see the point of casting Brad Pitt in such a small and unimportant role when any actor could of filled the role but this in no way hinders the enjoyment of the film. The film also has a great soundtrack which I listened to straight after I'd finished and has a good mix of different genre's.

So when she reveals she is a call girl hired to get him laid on his birthday it doesn't matter, and they get married.  Clarence decides to make Alabama's break from the job official by collecting her stuff from her pimp. However when that meeting turns into a bloodbath he mistakenly picks up a suitcase full of drugs.  The pair say their goodbyes and make off with the drugs to sell them in LA, however the drugs leave a track behind them, one that both the mob and the police follow.In the height of Tarantino fever, several of his scripts got quickly dusted off and handed to big name directors in an effort to capitalise on the public flavour for his dialogue and mix of pop culture references and violence.  True Romance was one such film and, in fairness it does fairly well to emulate the films of the writer himself - big cast, snappy dialogue, violent shoot outs and so on.  In fact the film lifts his style to the extent that it even rips off (or homage's) other films - most notably in the theme music that is almost a photocopy of Badlands.The film wears this a little too obviously and clearly is trying very hard to be Tarantino-esque, most of the time it works out but at times I just wanted it to relax a little bit.  The plot is pure geek wish fulfilment mixed with crime thriller; a beautiful woman picks up a comic-book fan in a cinema showing a martial arts triple bill!  It works reasonably well by filling the scenes with colourful characters, pop culture dialogue and violence - at times it gets a bit much and I wanted characters to talk normally without a wall-to-wall soundtrack just some of the time; however it does have some very good scenes at times.  Stand outs are the scene with Walken and Hopper and the scene where Alabama takes a beating, but, if you like Tarantino's films then you should be happy with most of this.The style of the film is a little uneven.  As I said, it is really trying hard to be a Tarantino film but at the same time you can see Scott's glossy action-movie hands all over it!  The two don't really fit together all the time and would honestly rather have had a different director at the helm. The cast however is as deep as Tarantino films were drawing at the time - everyone wanted the chance to be cool!  Slater is cool and fits the role well and even Arquette manages to be quite good, although her narration is about as flat and dull as they come.  It is the support cast though, who the film belongs to.  The film has roles for a variety of people whether it be non-speaking roles or one or two scenes.  In a way this is a bad thing because some great actors have nothing to do and are wasted but overall the effect is good and each cameo makes an impact.  When a cast includes Val Kilmer, Dennis Hopper, Gary Oldman, Brad Pitt, Christopher Walken, Bronson Pinchot, Samuel L Jackson, Victor Argo, Michael Rapaport, Saul Rubinek, James Gandolfini, Chris Penn and Tom Sizemore it has to be at least worth checking out!Despite the fact that Tarantino's words in another directors hands doesn't feel that right, and the fact that Scott's very slick Hollywood direction doesn't quite match with Tarantino's much less establishment writing this is still a good film.  As you'd expect it rips off every `lovers on the run' movie that you'll have seen but it still is funny and slick enough to stand up for the rather generous running time.  It may bottle the brave ending of the original script but it has some very good scenes along the way.",

This all in hindsight, because back in 1993, Tarantino was still pretty much an unknown quantity. With an uncanny ear for scintillating dialog, he lights up the screen with characters and situations that defy logic and gravity alike. And the film doesn't rely simply on the actions of it's principal characters either. The Christopher Walken/Dennis Hopper matchup would be a main event in any arena. The violence of course is quintessentially Tarantino, so one wouldn't be mistaken for thinking that Tony Scott was channeling the famed director this time out, as in virtually all respects, one would think Tarantino did the directing honors on this one too.With a star studded cast of principal and supporting players, this film is non-stop adrenaline all the way. So if you're a fan of this stuff you won't be disappointed. The rubout final showdown between the cops, the mob and the movie mogul's goons is reminiscent of a similar scene in the prior year's \"Reservoir Dogs\", but this time played out with a multiple cast that you can't keep track of for all the flying bullets and bodies.

Having heard both sides of the argument in recent days, it's little wonder that it has taken me the best part of a week after viewing to reach this conclusion (if you can call it that). Given that it has possibly one of the best casts ever assembled, a typically brash and brilliant script from Quentin Tarantino and a veteran of countless action movies at the helm, this really should have been one of the best films ever made and perhaps, if Tarantino had kept his hands on it, it might have been. Instead, we have an incredibly slick and entertaining crime film that I felt needed a bit more pace and consistency to become a true classic.In arguably his best film, Christian Slater plays Clarence who is an odd-beat loser working in a run-down comic shop in Detroit with an unhealthy interest in Elvis. After meeting the beautiful call-girl Alabama (Patricia Arquette), they both fall hopelessly in love and the newly-motivated Clarence decides to free Alabama from the grip of her pimp Drexel (Gary Oldman). But stumbling across a suitcase full of cocaine, Clarence decides to take the drugs to Hollywood and fund their new lives together. But unfortunately, the Mob are hot on their heels and soon discover what our lovestruck heroes have planned...This really is classic Tarantino territory - a contemporary crime thriller with tonnes of funky dialogue, more big-name actors than the entire \"Oceans\" trilogy and oodles of retro charm. And yet, \"True Romance\" certainly doesn't feel like a Tarantino film - the pace is all wrong (it feels much slower than \"Pulp Fiction\", despite being shorter in length) and dare I say it, I found myself losing interest. But just when I was about to give up, somebody new steps into shot and delivers another faultless performance. I have rarely seen acting of such quality from so many individuals, despite the fact that most are only in for a couple of scenes at best. Personally, I found James Gandolfini's portrayal of a Mob hit-man utterly convincing and it certainly ensured he'd be typecast for the rest of his career. Hell, even Val Kilmer doesn't suck! But all the time, I found myself wondering how truly brilliant this film might have been if Tarantino had never sold it. I understand his reasons why - I'd forgive almost anything for giving us \"Pulp Fiction\" - but I feel Tony Scott didn't quite know what to do with it. Exhibit A - the ill-judged and misplaced scene on the roller-coaster.It's not that \"True Romance\" is a bad film because it isn't and I'd happily watch it again sometime. But I just feel that Scott wasn't the right director, although he has worked miracles with the cast who are all supremely good. PBs for Kilmer, Slater and Arquette while Christopher Walken and Dennis Hopper share one of the all-time great scenes like two giant beasts tearing each other to shreds. But \"True Romance\" isn't the bone-fide classic some people think it is. It's too slow and the ending is far too predictable, ruining what should have been an absolute stonker of a movie. And it should have be - all the ingredients were in place with the exception of the director. So is this a great crime film or a wasted chance? Personally, I think greatness has slipped through our fingers.",

            "content": "True Romance is one of those movies that I've heard about for so many years and heard so many great things about, but never actually got around to seeing until now. In many ways, this is a classic Tarantino film. Albeit, it's only written by him and directed, it still feels like the same old obscurely charming tone that he brings to each of his films. At its heart, True Romance is a romance with a little bit of violence, luckily the incredibly talented cast and smartly written script, it's a whole lot more than that.I'd be wrong not to mention the amazing Hans Zimmer score that finally turned me on to the film. It's so simple, yet so cheerfully poignant, if that makes sense. Coming and going when needed, and always having a presence, it's truly one of Hans Zimmer's best, which is saying a lot. I had to get that out of the way because there's plenty more to get excited about with True Romance. Let's take the cast for example, which displays some of the greatest cameos in film history. Christian Slater, Patricia Arquette, Michael Rapaport, Bronson Pinchot, and Brad Pitt make up the main cast. But the supporting cast includes Dennis Hopper, James Gandolfini, Samuel L. Jackson, Christopher Walken, Tom Sizemore, Val Kilmer, and Gary Oldman make their presence felt for sure. I don't want to overstate it, but it may be the greatest ensemble of all time.It's not just that there's a lot of great actors though, everyone gets their chance to shine. Brad Pitt has a glorified cameo-role, but yet it's one of his more memorable roles. Gary Oldman is unrecognizable as Drexel, and also has a small part, but his big scene is easy one of the best in the film. Gandolfini, in a pre-Sopranos gig, proves to charismatic yet terrifying as a henchman for a crime boss. And who can forget Walken's iconic cameo as Vincenzo Coccotti, another person after Clarence and the cocaine he stole. Scene after scene, line after line, True Romance is one of the most quotable and re-watchable films ever made.Granted, after one viewing I'm over-hyping it a bit. There are some undeniable issues with True Romance, like how everything happens so easily for Clarence. There are some consequences for his character here and there, but for the most part, he gets away with what he wants and it all comes very easily for a guy who was just presented to be a nerd from Detroit. I also don't feel like the ending completely wraps up what it needs to. In classic Tarantino fashion, things happen really fast and in a chaotic and unexpected nature, therefore leaving a few strings loose in the end. Seemingly leaving the door open for a sequel, which never came.In all though, True Romance is a film that is as enjoyable to watch as it probably was to film. Everything was hitting on all cylinders, and it became a classic many years later for it. 8.4/10",

            "content": "\"Top Gun\" director Tony Scott pulls out all stops in \"True Romance,\" a wonderfully lyrical, but abrasive crime thriller that opens in frigid, snowy Detroit, migrates to warm, sunny Los Angeles, and then concludes on a sandy beach in Mexico. \"Beverly Hills Cop \" lenser Jeffrey L. Kimball is such a gifted cinematographer that he makes everything in this off-beat romantic actioneer look picture postcard gorgeous and Scott orchestrates the shoot-outs for maximum impact. You will see a lot of Dutch tilt angles in \"True Romance\" to capture the dangerous, topsy-turvy hi-jinks. While Christian Slater and Patricia Arquette are the leaders, the producers have surrounded them with a superlative supporting cast, and Brad Pitt gives one of the best performances in a rather slight role as a slacker who lives on a couch. Christopher Walken, Dennis Hopper, Gary Oldman, Samuel L. Jackson, and Val Kilmer as Elvis flesh out the film. Further, Scott has assembled a variety of songs both popular and classical that do as much to enliven the atmosphere of a scene as the cinematography. The editing on the roller-coaster scene is nothing short of spectacular. Like any Tarantino-directed movie, \"True Romance\" contains myriad references to pop culture, especially Elvis Presley, Sonny Chiba, Charles Bronson, \"Star Trek's\" Captain Kirk, and John Woo's Hong Kong actioneers, with profanity galore. The story follows the misadventures of a young, twentysomething drifter from Detroit and his wife--a reformed prostitute--as they head out to Hollywood to sell a suitcase bulging with cocaine and then ride off into the sunset.Clarence Worley (Christian Slater of \"Heathers\") works at a comic book store, Heroes for Sale, and every year during his birthday he attends a Sonny Chiba triple feature. Tonight he encounters the woman of his dreams, Alabama (Patricia Arquette) and spends an eventful night with her. Initially, Alabama plans to leave Clarence, but she cannot compose a letter and gets no farther than 'Dear Clarence.' Later, Clarence learns that Alabama is a 'call girl' and his boss paid for her. Nevertheless, Clarence and Alabama falls hopelessly in love and venture downtown the next day to wed. They have matching tattoos inked into their bodies. Clarence asks Alabama about her things that she left where she worked as a prostitute. Our blonde heroine tries to dissuade Clarence from dropping in on her former pimp Drexl Spivey (Gary Oldman of \"Rosencrantz & Guildenstern Are Dead\"), so he can retrieve her things. Meantime, Clarence's idol, the late Elvis Presley (Val Kilmer of \"Top Gun\") advises Clarence on his options. What makes Elvis' appearances cool is that you catch only glimpses of his face, you see his body only making those characteristic Elvis' moves. Usually, Elvis\u2014called the 'Mentor' in the screen credits\u2014talks to Clarence when our hero is in the bathroom.Clarence is determined that he must severe any ties between Alabama's old boss and her new way of life. A gunfight erupts at Drexl's place and Clarence survives miraculously. He orders a hooker to give him Alabama's suitcase. What he gets is a ton of cocaine. Ironically, the suitcase has an anti-narcotics bumper sticker on it. Earlier, Drexl double-crossed some associates and stole the suitcase from them. Thus begins Clarence's odyssey. Alabama and he head out for Los Angeles, but before they blow out of town, Clarence checks in on his divorced father Clifford Worley (Dennis Hopper of \"True Grit\") to see if the authorities know anything about Drexl's death. Clifford clears any doubts that Clarence has so Alabama and he pile into his pink convertible Cadillac and take off for California to meet his old friend Dick Ritchie (Michael Rapaport of \"Zebrahead\"), an aspiring actor with an audition for the new \"T.J. Hooker.\" Predictably, Dick doesn't know what to say when he sees all the coke. Nevertheless, he is frustrated that Clarence thinks that he has connections in the Hollywood industry to unload the cocaine.Meanwhile, after Clarence and Alabama leave, the Sicilian mob comes a-calling, and Clifford meets Vincenzo Coccotti (Christopher Walken of \"The Deer Hunter\") who tells him all about Clarence and the stolen narcotics. Of course, Clifford doesn't believe a word of it, but Coccotti wants to know where his product is so he tortures Clifford. He starts out by slashing his hand. One of the best scenes in \"True Romance\" has Clifford telling off Coccotti with a politically incorrect yarn about why Italians in southern Italy no longer have blue eyes and blond hair. Tarantino has gone on record saying that he got this fanciful story from an African-American friend. The bit of classical music that is set against Clifford's history lesson is stunning. Naturally, Coccotti isn't amused when Clifford calls him 'an egg-plant.' Anyway, Clifford refuses to divulge the whereabouts of Clarence and Alabama, and Coccotti blasts him at point blank range with a revolver. Attired in a topcoat with a scarf, Coccotti resembles a priest about to administer last rites. No sooner have they executed Clifford than a mobster finds a note attached to the fridge and provides them with Clarence's contact information in Hollywood. The dramatic irony of this revelation and Clifford's decision to sacrifice himself for his son is quite striking.In Hollywood, Dick introduces our heroes to Elliot Blitzer (Bronson Pinchot of \"Beverly Hills Cop\") who serves as a assistant to movie mogul Lee Donowitz (Saul Rubinek of \"Unforgiven\") and Clarence convinces Lee to buy the coke. Eventually, the Detroit mob hits Los Angeles and they come gunning for Clarence, with one of Coccotti's henchmen, Virgil (James Gandolfini of \"The Sopranos\"), taking an interest in Alabama. The fight between Alabama and Virgil is one of the most violent scenes and she celebrates her victory in a chant of primal ecstasy that makes her look like Tarzan.\"True Romance\" is a fantastic movie with memorable dialogue worth quoting. The protagonists are both young and sympathetic. Christian Slater will never play another character as likable as Clarence Worley.",

            "content": "This is a great movie, a cool movie, a funny movie and an action movie. Directed by Tony Scott, one of the best (if not the best) action movie directors around, True Romance is the story of Alabama (Arquette) and Clarence (Slater) young newlywed lovers on the run with a stolen suitcase full of $5m worth of the mafia's coke, which they intend to sell. But as the old saying goes, the path to true love never runs smooth and a battle of wits ensues between Clarence, the police and the mob leading to a classic finale in this action packed film. As a whole, this movie works beautifully but on DVD it's even better because you can access all your favorite classic scenes that unmistakeably bare Tarantino's hallmark again and again. Such as the opening scene where the heterosexual Clarence (Slater) states that he'd sleep with Elvis if he were still alive, or the showdown between Clarence and dread-locked gangster (Oldman). Or the showdown between the mob boss (Walken) and Clarence's Dad (Hopper). Classic scenes indeed, particularly the one with Walken and Hopper.Also some other great performers that make this movie as entertaining as it is, are: Michael Rappaport as the dopey aspiring actor (auditioning, of all things, for a one-time role as Crook #2 for an episode of \"T.J. Hooker\" that is set to co-star Peter Breck!), Chris Penn and Tom Sizemore as over-zealous narc squad partners, and Bronson Pinchot is wonderfully whiny as a movie producer's whipping boy and go-fer named Elliot. So I suggest you sit back, relax, and suspend disbelief while you are taken on a very strange and very satisfying ride through a lesser known piece of the Quentin Tarantino universe.Overall rating: 8 out of 10.",

Rock music has this division as well.Many moviegoers don't seem to know the difference, especially when the simple-minded excess is artificially flavored, as we have here. Tarantino's basic approach is flavored mere noise. The noise is to take character stereotypes and make them as extremely stereotypical as they can be, way past outrageous. The flavor is to do this in a way that is distinctly self-referentially ironic. That way, the audience `participates' believing themselves to be in on a celebration of excess in film through excess itself.It seems to work, since the audience doesn't seem to need much: here a salute to comicbooks and dope. It is a simple pleasure and painless we are told, so lay back. But with so many intelligent uses of a similar device (see `Ghost Dog'). Do we really need Quentin?

            "content": "Seems as though it were crafted by a real geek. Sorry, Quentin. TRUE ROMANCE (1993)** 1/2 out of *****Much of Tony Scott's \"True Romance\" seems as though it were crafted by a real geek. The film's hero, Clarence, is a quintessential loser -- every year on his birthday he goes to see a movie and all 364 other days are spent working at a comic book store. Mere coincidence, then, that its writer is Quentin Tarantino? (A man who used to work as a video store clerk and watch \"three to four movies a day\" before hitting the big time as a director with 1992's \"Reservoir Dogs.\")Most of \"True Romance\" doesn't seem very real at all. It's a harsh movie, but that doesn't bother me at all. It's when the character -- a self-confessed geek -- picks up a gun and goes on a killing spree at a brothel in order to free his call girl wife that the film seems to exaggerate just a bit. (Travis Bickle? Yes. A geeky nerd? No.) It seems like the sort of dream that Quentin Tarantino may have had years ago. In the real world, this all just seems a bit odd.But the characters aren't living in our world. They're in Quentin's. I originally read the script for \"True Romance\" and thought it was splendid -- but soon found that Tony Scott's direction betrayed the darkness of the screenplay, creating a sort of half-good/half-bad movie that leaves the audience wanting more. Sure, \"True Romance\" has its good parts, but the people who tell you it's the best film ever are part of the \"True Romance\" cult. It's nothing more than a good movie with a fine script and bad direction. Scott (\"Top Gun\") has made some fine movies, but in terms of actual direction, this is one of his lesser ones.Why? Well, for starters, the story is rather dark and grimy and bleak. Scott forces his audience into liking these characters so much that he betrays the grim tone for a happy look. The problem? Well, the characters are rather corrupt and the story is rather dark and the outcome is potentially unmerited. Scott changed the ending to the film, making it happier, which Quentin Tarantino admits works for the story. But, as he says on the DVD commentary, had he filmed the movie, it would have been a lot different. And when Quentin says that, I think he means better.Don't blame the cast. These are top-notch actors in Oscar-worthy roles. But somehow, given their characteristics, they never come across as anything more than caricatures -- exaggerated molds of real people. Clarence is played by Christian Slater, and he meets and falls in love with Alabama (Patricia Arquette), soon finding out she's a hooker. Their romance is something I would expect a soap opera writer to craft -- they meet, he falls for her, she falls for him (hooker with a heart of gold!), they sleep together (in a scene reminiscent of that criticized love sequence from \"Top Gun\"), and he risks everything to free her. In less than twenty-four hours. Is something a bit odd here? It's like a geek's wet dream.The supporting cast is to die for: Dennis Hopper, Gary Oldman, Val Kilmer, Christopher Walken, Michael Rapaport, James Gandolfini, Chris Penn, Tom Sizemore and Brad Pitt. They all do well in their roles, but seem to be boasted on the posters for promotional value. Hopper and Oldman have the most scenes, but die early on. Kilmer's face is never seen, and his body only appears in two sequences. Walken is in a single scene during the entire film, and Gandolfini is introduced (and executed) quite late into the movie. Bummer. It's basically the adventures of Clarence and Alabama.Nothing wrong with that, except that their story copies from everything in sight -- most notably, \"Bonnie and Clyde.\" To be fair, I understand what Quentin meant to do with his tale, and his original ending (although depressing) was much more suitable given the content of the movie. Quentin tried to add a dark streak to the clich\u00e9d romance-on-the-run genre, and Scott mistakenly made yet another happy-go-lucky (although very violent) road romance with two very simplistic, innocent, fake characters overcoming obstacles to succeed in the end. This is the stuff Charlie Kaufman hates.The whole way through the movie, I felt as though I were staring at comical shadows of potentially real people, waiting to break through their boundaries and convince us all that they are more than just clich\u00e9s. This script was sold early on in Quentin's career so that he could film \"Reservoir Dogs\" with the income. He was reportedly never very happy with the outcome of \"True Romance,\" a film he had hoped to direct, and I don't blame him. From the very opening credits, I could tell this film was taking the wrong path given its source material. Maybe I shouldn't have read the script first. Maybe I had preconceptions. But it's still not a very well made movie. Blame Scott.How some people love this movie is still beyond me.",

While the title suggests images of hugs, kisses, holding hands, and heartfelt human emotion, the film instead bombards the audience with images of blazing guns, brutal beatings, and lots of gushing blood while telling a twisted and entertaining tale of outlaw lovers on the run.Clarence (Christain Slater in his best role ever) is a comic-book store employee, living a meager but not intolerable life in Detroit. On his birthday night, he meets a pretty blonde hooker named Alabama (Patricia Arquette, reliably efficient and displaying a great chemistry with Slater) and they are soon positively smitten, declaring their love for each other, only to be married a few days later. Clarence goes to see her pimp, Drexl (a truly whacked-out Gary Oldman who devours his ten minutes on screen), with the meeting ending with Clarence killing him and making off with a suitcase. The case, which Clarence thought contained Alabama's clothes, actually contains two-million dollars' worth of cocaine, and this puts this newly-married duo find themselves in quite the thorny predicament. Once the dust - and blood - clears, they decide to trek off to Hollywood to see Clarence's pal who might know some industry folks interested in high-quality coke. Little do they know that Drexl's partners (led by Christopher Walken's quietly malicious Vincenzo) are tracking them and intend to get their merchandise back, eliminating the couple for good measure.True Romance is a paper-thin but enjoyably quirky romance carried by great dialogue, an unpredictable plot, and a cast of wildly original characters. The storyline is far from earth-shattering, but it guarantees some good escapist fun, especially since the script boasts a few scenes possessive of great wit and sparkle, along with a show-stopping one chock-full of dynamic psychological tension \u2013 between Dennis Hopper (who brings a phenomenal degree of warmth as Clarence's father) and Christopher Walken, whose \"vendetta kinda mood\" head-to-head became one of the most memorable sparrings of cinema. Many people may be turned off by the graphic and sometimes savage violence of True Romance. But that is only part of the dirty, funny and unpredictably violent genius of Mr. Tarantino. Tarantino and Tony Scott never pretend that the film is more than what it is - slickly entertaining trash.Eventually, it is Tarantino's gutter poetry that detonates True Romance.

            "content": "The film was written by Quentin Tarantino, and it really shows with the sharp dialogue and crazy plot. The film centres around Clarence (Christian Slater) who meets and marries Alabama (Patricia Arquette). After Clarence goes to get Alabama's belongings, through a series of mishaps, he ends up with suitcase of coke and they decide to sell it. This leads to a wild adventure involving drug dealers, police and movie executives.The casting in this film is amazing with Hollywood greats turning up and each one adds something special to the film. But by far the best performance is by Brad Pitt as the roommate of Clarence's friend Dick. He is on screen for a total of about 5 minutes but steals every scene he is in. However every one of the characters in the film brings something special. The performances by Hollywood greats, including Dennis Hopper, Christopher Walken and Gary Oldman all come so close to being over the top, but the incredible script and brilliant directing manage to hold back just enough to stop it going too far.This film is a true masterpiece where everything just falls in to place. The film is not for the faint of heart though. There are very graphic scenes of violence. One particular scene involving a woman getting severely beaten. The perpetrator definitely gets his comeuppance though. While the violence is very graphic, as with most of Tarantino's films, it is very bloody but also portrayed in a realistic manor. This adds to the shock and also to bring you closer to the victims.I cannot praise this film enough. It is one of the greats that has been overlooked by many including Hollywood. Almost all of the performances are worthy of Oscar nomination, as with the script. But this film was overlooked by all the major awards.If you are a fan of Tarantino films, or films with a good cast and great story give this film a try. I know people that hate this film, but I know far more that love it.",

            "content": "Somehow, I've never seen this movie before. Sure, it was featured by other writers on the site before and I've owned it for some time, but somehow I've never found the reason to watch it. Luckily, Arrow Video released several new versions of the film on blu ray and 4K UHD, which gave me the opportunity.What was I waiting for?True Romance was a script Quentin Tarantino sold after Reservoir Dogs and unlike so many of his written work, it was directed by someone else: Tony Scott (ironic, as Tarantino went off on Scott's best-known film Top Gun in the 1994 movie Sleep With Me).I kind of love that this started with Roger Avery unable to finish a script, so he turned it over to Tarantino, who gave him a stack of pages back which were Natural Born Killers and this movie, which starts after the prison riot and features Mickey and Mallory Knox tracking down the writer who made the cash-in film about their lives. As that writer hides out, he writes True Romance.Tarantino has said that it's his most autobiographical film and by and large, he was happy with the way it turned out. It's pretty faithful to his screenplay, other than changing the story to a linear structure and not the all-over-the-place narrative that Tarantino would use for Pulp Fiction. He also took much of the film's first act from his 1987 effort My Best Friend's Birthday.I have to say, as a man obsessed with movies that married a short-haired blonde from Detroit, this movie has a lot to say to me.As Clarence Worley (Christian Slater) sits alone in a theater watching a Sonny Chiba triple feature, Alabama Whitman (Patricia Arquette) - named from Pam Grier's character in The Big Bird Cage - spills her popcorn all over him, leading to an evening where the two bond over cinema, Elvis, diner food and sex.The next day, she tells him that she was hired to give him a good time by his boss. He doesn't care; they're both in love. They get married and moments later, Elvis (Val Kilmer) himself appears to Clarence and tells him that he has to set Alabama free from her pimp Drexl (Gary Oldman, perfect for the too brief time he's on screen). All Clarence wants is her to be free, Drexl attempts to kill him, but misjudges just how strong Alabama's love makes the young man. Running into the night with two dead bodies left behind, the young couple learns that they have a briefcase packed with cocaine.As we follow the couple to Hollywood, where Dick Ritchie (Michael Rappaport) and Elliot Blitzer (Bronson Pinchot) broker a deal with movie producer Lee Donowitz (Elliot Blitzer; this character produced Bounty Law in Once Upon a Time...In Hollywood, is the son of Donny Donowitz from Inglorious Bastards; the movie that he produced that Clarence speaks so highly of, Coming Home In a Body Bag stars Rick Dalton, who is the hero of Once Upon a Time...In Hollywood; he's also pretty much Joel Silver).This drug deal is complicated by the fact that Drexl had stolen the cocaine from Blue Lou Boyle, which sends Vincenzo Coccotti (Christopher Walken) and an army of killers on the trail of Clarence and Alabama. Meanwhile, a cocaine and oral sex aided and abetted arrest leads to the cops wiring Elliot for the big drug deal, an event that leads to a Mexican standoff between our happy couple, the Hollywood elite, organized crime and the police, led by detectives Nicky Dimes (Chris Penn) and Cody Nicholson (Tom Sizemore).There's so much that happens in this movie and so much to discuss, but I think it's perhaps best experienced by the viewer. That said, there's an astounding scene between Clarence's father (Dennis Hopper) and Coccotti, as well as Alabama remaining resilient in the face and fists of a hired killer (James Gandolfini). Oh - and Brad Pitt pretty much inventing the movie Pineapple Express with his scene with the mob interrogating him.The original ending had Clarence dying and the widowed Alabama eventually turning to crime. Evidence of that is in Reservoir Dogs and Mr. White (Harvey Keitel) talking about working with Alabama.",

Here he bumps into Alabama, a beautiful young blonde, and they immediately hit it off; one thing leads to another and she stays the night. It turns out that their meeting wasn't chance, she was a call girl hired by his boss; he isn't upset though; in fact he falls in love with her and she falls for him; so much so they are married the next day. Clarence goes to collect her stuff but after a confrontation with her now ex-pimp he kills the man and picks up the wrong case. Instead of a case of clothes the newlyweds find themselves with half a million dollars' worth of uncut cocaine. Clarence has no idea how to sell it but a friend of a friend might have an idea so the two of them set off for LA; not knowing that the coke actually belonged to the Mafia and they want it back.This action film brings together director Tony Scott and writer Quentin Tarantino; which leads to slick violent action and some snappy banter. The story isn't full of twists and turns but that isn't a bad thing; the only real question is 'will Clarence and Alabama get away with it or not?' and that is what it is all about. Christian Slater and Patricia Arquette do a fine job in the lead roles and they are ably supported by some well-known actors in the secondary roles; these include Gary Oldman, Brad Pitt, James Gandolfini, Denis Hopper and Christopher Walken\u0085 they may not be on the screen for long but they put in memorable performances. If you like films with plenty of action and laughs that come naturally rather than from forced situations you should love this\u0085 just don't buy the DVD for your granny who likes nice romances!",

            "content": "True Romance is an excellent and powerful classic that mixes Action,Romance and Crime Drama. Filled with great direction,a masterful screenplay by Quentin Tarantino,an amazing cast and a wonderful soundtrack,True Romance is Tony Scott and Quentin Tarantino at their best.True Romance tells the story of Clarence Worley(Christian Slater),a comic book store clerk who while out celebrating his birthday meets up with a hooker named Alabama(Patricia Arquette). After one night of romance and sex the two fall in love and get married. When Alabama wants to get out of her life as a hooker,Clarence decides to get her briefcase of clothes only to discover that the briefcase of full of bags of cocaine that belongs to the mob. Now,with Clarence and Alabama heading to Los Angeles for their honeymoon,the couple have to deal with Gangsters,Cops and tons of danger and violence.Released in 1993,True Romance is a classic film that despite being directed by Tony Scott,written by Quentin Tarantino and receiving rave reviews from critics was a Box Office failure and ignored by audiences. But thanks to the worldwide critical and Box Office success of Tarantino's masterpiece Pulp Fiction,True Romance was rediscovered by audiences on home video and cable and became a Cult film and a classic and the praise is well deserved. True Romance is great film that just flawlessly mixes Action,Crime Drama and Romance all within two hours and just grabs you by the throat until the very end. It's a film that thrills and excites you with suspense,drama and Action and gives viewers a truly amazing and unforgettable cinematic experience that you will never ever forget. It's a wild and unpredictable journey that is surreal and politically incorrect and it just stays with you after you watch it. TR is a beautiful love story set in the dark world of drugs and violence and you see the great balance of a love story and the dark violence that hangs over the film and that's what makes TR very clever and original. Although TR was directed by Tony Scott,TR is truly a Quentin Tarantino film through and through. The screenplay by Tarantino is brilliant and unforgettable and has all of the trademarks that are often associated with Tarantino's other films:pop culture references,sharp dialog,black Humor and memorable well-written characters. The dialog and characters in the film are amazing,fresh and original with each scene of the main characters and dialog just coming alive and explodes with fire and intensity. Each main character who's in the film for a long or short period of time will stay with viewers because Tarantino's script and Scott's direction allow them too and each main character commands the screen. Tarantino has said that TR is his most personal screenplay and it is true with references to Kung Fu films,love for movies and comic books and references to other films. Clarence and Alabama are great characters because they feel real and true and when you see Clarence and Alabama say that they love each other it doesn't feel forced or fake but very romantic and powerful. And despite the violence and chaos all around them,Clarence and Alabama stand by each other. Clarence and Albama are two characters you won't forget. The Action scenes in the film are great and brutal and the thing that I love about each Action scene in the film is that there is great build up and suspense with dialog and when the dialog and build up ends it explodes with violence. Tony Scott brings the same brutal violence and cynical style he brought two years before in his Action classic The Last Boy Scout and does it without missing a beat. The ending of the film is amazing and when the ending happens it's very explosive and at the same time optimistic and truly beautiful for the main characters Clarence and Alabama. It's an amazing and wonderful ending that will make viewers smile and cheer and is a great cap off to this classic film.The whole cast is masterful. Christian Slater and Patrica Arquette are excellent and their best as Clarence and Alabama,with Slater and Arquette bringing intensity,depth and great chemistry to their roles. Dennis Hopper is fantastic as Clifford Worley,Clarence's policeman Father. Val Kilmer is great as Clarence's Mentor in a yellow jacket who like Clarence. Gary Oldman is brilliant as always in his small role as Detroit player Drexl Spivey,Alabama's pimp. Brad Pitt is hilarious and fun as Floyd,Dick's stoner roommate. Christopher Walken is wonderful as Vincent Coccotti,a Detroit gangster. Bronson Pinchot(Elliot),Michael Rapaport(Dick Ritchie),James Gandolfini(RIP)(Virgil),Saul Rubinek(Lee Donowitz),Samuel L. Jackson(Big John),Chris Penn(RIP)(Nicky Dimes),Tom Sizemore(Cody Nicholson)and Anna Thomson(Lucy)give good performances as well.The direction by Tony Scott is brilliant and stylish,with Scott using great camera angles,harsh lighting giving the film a beautiful visual style while Scott also does a wonderful job with the Action scenes. Rest In Peace Tony Scott you are and were one of the greatest Action directors of all time and you left the world too soon. RIP,Scott.The score by Hans Zimmer is beautiful,dark,light and romantic,with Zimmer making the score beautiful and dramatic and matching each scene in the film. Great score by Zimmer.In final word,if you love Tony Scott,Quentin Tarantino,Action Films,Crime Dramas,Romantic love stories or films in general,I highly suggest you see True Romance,an excellent and unforgettable classic that you can watch again and again. Highly Recommended. 10/10.",

It has everything an audience could ask for; murder, action, romance, sex, comedy, drama and a great story behind it!Quite possibly my new favorite (written-by) Quintin Tarintino film. I can't actually tell you what the film is about without ruining it, but let's just say, it's excellent. It's not a chick flick or a guy movie, it's a little bit of both...but enough of each so that everyone can enjoy.I'm really excited about this film, because it's so cleverly written, with quite a bit of honesty and reality thrown into it, that you can enjoy it without getting frustrated from the unrealisticness of some parts, or the intensity of some of the other scenes. The acting was outstanding, and let's face it Christian Slater is not too ugly to watch in a movie, and Patricia Arquette's breasts had top billing above her name I think. But, she herself was amazing. I don't know if she was nominated for this role, but she should have been, because she was excellent. Probably the best character and actor in the whole movie. A lot stars are in this before they were \"stars\" including; Brad Pitt, Christopher Walken, Dennis Hopper, Michael Rappaport, Bronson Pinchot, and James Gandalfini.I recommend this film to everyone! It's an awesome movie, but mind the rating. It's rated the way it is for a reason. There is some violence and some nudity and sexual content that might not be suitable for some.I hope everyone takes a look...I'm adding it to my collection!",

Written by a pre-\"Pulp Fiction\" Quentin Tarantino, whose love of cinema and movie-lore is apparent right from the beginning (with an opening credits sequence that seems a direct riff on Terrence Malick's \"Badlands\"). Tony Scott directed, and though he's more attracted to sleaze than movie in-jokes, he keeps the action strong and hard-hitting. Unfortunately, after a promising start, the characters become stock figures in Scott's morass, a game of bad guys vs. worse guys. As a result, there's no emotion by the end, no exhilaration, just the feeling of having been batted around. Worth a look for \"Pulp Fiction\" fans and for some eccentric ideas and casting choices (such as Gary Oldman as the half-black pimp or Val Kilmer as the ghost of Elvis!). **1/2 from ****",

It was just too much in the way of language and unlikeable characters. There is not one person in this movie is has anything but a low-life. It's gets repulsive after awhile.However, before that - to give the movie its due - there are a number of over-the-top performances and scenes I won't soon forget: for one, Dennis Hopper explaining in derogatory history of Sicilians to Scicilian hit man Christopher Walken. That was hilarious. Then there's Gary Oldman imitation of a black pimp, so outrageous one can't describe it. Then, of course, the wild shootout scene at the end.",

Reservoir Dogs was a worldwide critically acclaimed debut, but True Romance was written by Quentin Tarantino way before Reservoir Dogs was made. Therefore it is logical to assume that the real debut of Tarantino was actually True Romance, Tarantino's first motion picture, as a screenwriter.With this cool script Tarantino molded True Romance into a brilliant gangster movie like only he can make them. Yes, we gotta pay some dues to the director Tony Scott as well, but to be honest, this is a full blown Tarantino flick: \"so cool, so cool, so cool\".Every characteristic later to be found in all Tarantino classics can already be found in the script of True Romance: the referals to other movie classics, the obnoxious violence and most of all lots of brilliant true to life dialogue. Tarantino is a known addict of talkshows and I love Tarantino's work foremost for his ever brilliant dialogues. The acting is brilliant too, with an incredible big cast of now household names that perform as supporting actors. Choose your pick: roles by a young Brad Pitt, and a young Samuel L Jackson. The always to be feared Dennis Hopper, Christopher Walken, Gary Oldman and James Gandolfini who all play crucial and shocking supporting roles. Christian Slater's best role in his entire carreer, and Patricia Arquette has never shone as brightly as she did in True Romance. This movie is an actor's heaven. Just incredible, you wont find any movie today with such a star cast.Everything is over the top in this movie. It bursts with energy! And almost everything is full blown big. The soundtrack is subtle, gorgeous yet very powerful. The photograpy is over the top, but still very mesmirizing. The speed of this thing just won't stop. Even the scenes with just dialogues are performed on steroids. Everthing is big, fast and cool about True Romance! This picture shows Tarantino bursting to life with his first script.

But I really have to praise Gary Oldman as the crazy pimp in this movie. Although he doesn't get much screen time, by far one of the best performances of all time. Dennis Hopper and Christopher Walken also stand out in this movie, especially in a scene they share together. Oh and James Gandolfini is also in this one.Like I said, the dialogue is amazing but I don't think the movie always goes down as smoothly as Tony Scott would have liked it to. It just feels to me that the pacing is kinda off sometimes and the score doesn't help. This is a weird thing for me to say cause Hans Zimmer composed the music for the movie, and I'm a huge fan of his, but I really didn't like the score to this movie, I thought it was annoying.Nevertheless, True Romance is thoroughly entertaining and it's a movie that takes chances. It's not generic, it's not typical and I love that. One can't help but wonder what would have happened if Tarantino had gotten his hands on the camera.",

He manages to steal cocaine from her pimp and tries to sell it in Hollywood whilst the owners of the cocaine try to reclaim it.Despite not being a Tarantino directed film, True Romance very much has the same energy as one and it's mainly due to Tarantino's terrific screenplay. The dialogue is, as you would expect from a script by Quentin Tarantino, fantastic with some scenes where it really stands out and the way each actor delivers them allows those scenes to be even better. Christian Slater and Patricia Arquette are amazing here and do have great chemistry with one another despite how quick their relationship develops. I honestly couldn't recognise Gary Oldman as Drexl but he delivered an insane performance. Dennis Hopper and Christopher Walken star in one of the film's most memorable and riveting scenes where both actors shine. Brad Pitt has a short role here but provides a lot of the humour.Tony Scott, director of Top Gun, has directed the film and does add a lot of style to it. This is a film that is over the top and feels very 90s which, looking at it now, does make True Romance seem a tad outdated. I wish the story had more substance to it and the way it ended seemed quite rushed and didn't work with me completely.Despite that I think the film is still an entertaining venture.

It hardly won any awards even though the acting is top-class in this movie, as well as the story itself is.Basically this movie is the ultimate guy-movie. Violence, shootouts, cursing, cool characters, all put together in a clever script that is filled with some typical Tarantino dialog and situations. How could you not love this movie? It has some highly memorable sequences in it, mainly thanks to the great cast and acting.The cast of this movie is absolutely amazing. Lot's of well known actors show up in some rather small roles such as Christopher Walken who with his one scene makes such a lasting impression, that you easily forget that he only is in the movie for a few minutes. Same goes for Gary Oldman in a totally flipped role and Samuel L. Jackson who basically only is in for about a minute or so. Other impressive small roles are being played by James Gandolfini, Chris Penn, Tom Sizemore (crazy as always), Michael Rapaport, Victor Argo, Brad Pitt as a hilarious stoner, Ed Lauter, Dennis Hopper, Saul Rubinek, Val Kilmer and Bronson Pinchot. The two main leads, Christian Slater and Patricia Arquette might not be as impressive as the rest of the cast but the supporting cast more than compensates for this.But it really are Gary Oldman, Dennis Hopper and Christopher Walken who steal the show in this movie. Gary Oldman is totally crazy over-the-top as a white pimp who acts- and thinks that he is a black person. The famous sequences between Dennis Hopper and Christopher Walken is a true classic and one of the best acted sequences I have ever seen. Those 10 minutes alone are more than enough to make this movie worth watching. It's such a well written and acted out sequence. It never loses it's power, no matter how often you have already seen it. I think I already know that dialog by heart right now.It's a great story of romance, drugs, stealing and killing. The movie is made very lighthearted, meaning that it's incredible fun to watch. The movie is obviously not made serious, just look at the over-the-top characters and dialog. It's really Quentin Tarantino who deserves most credit for this movie, even though it was Tony Scott who directed the movie.I absolutely love this movie and I never get tired of watching it. The characters, actors and writing are all at their very best. Violent crime movies don't get much better than this one. Great fun from start till finish, an absolute must-see!10/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/",

            "content": "True Romance succeeds very well at being fun, entertaining and exciting. However, it lacks depth in a noticeable way. It lacks an ending, a message. It does go pretty full out but not enough to work only on that level. I felt there was a lack of heart, of sincerity. It is kind of romantic but not really. Not in a profound way. It's a mix-match of crazy scenarios, villains, twists and accidents that don't add together but just distract you along the way.But at least the plot keeps moving and is full of surprises and funny situations. It had me laughing out loud several times. Bronson Pinchot and all the scenes he was in were hilarious. Tom Sizemore and Chris Penn were also very funny. Christian Slater is likable but a bit naive while Patricia Arquette is gorgeous and lovely - she is feminine and caring but also strong.The supporting cast is full of great actors giving excellent performances. Gary Oldman is one of my all-time favourite actors and it's incredible how he vanishes into his weird but menacing character. Christopher Walken is quite intimidating even with his cheeky smile and twinkling eyes. Dennis Hopper is superb and his scene with Walken appears to be one of the most popular movie moments of the 90s. James Gandolfini has a brutal scene with Patricia Arquette that makes a big impact. Brad Pitt is pretty amusing in his 2 minutes or so of screen-time.It's not surprising at all that Tarantino wrote the script. In fact, his screenplay was apparently divided up into both this film and Natural Born Killers. The dialogue isn't on the level of his other movies - it's not as sharp or insightful. I prefer the philosophy and bite of his directorial efforts. But the overall structure is very similar: there are shoot-outs, the threat of torture, drugs, unexpected visitors and trivial conversations. Moreover, Tarantino intended for the scenes to be in a non-chronological order (like Pulp Fiction). It's hard to say if that might have worked better. Tony Scott seems okay as a director but I think he tends to focus on style over substance and fails to give the movie any special mark of his own.One issue I did have was the exploitation of violence and lack of a solid message. Is it really just about a true romance? Considering all the violence and comedy, it obviously doesn't take the idea seriously. But great movies should have some kind of purpose and True Romance clearly lacks that. Confidence is good but it can turn into cockiness.You could throw in some deleted scenes, take certain scenes out and it wouldn't make a difference. The scenes don't build on top of each-other. True Romance is engaging but only as an action comedy thriller, not as a great story. There are no unique insights, no satire or commentary. And it basically glorifies violence. As if it's fun and doesn't have serious consequences.",

            "content": "QT wrote this film and it was directed by Tony \"Ridley's Little Brother\" Scott and it is, quite simply, a masterpiece. A violent masterpiece, yes, but a masterpiece nonetheless. Christian Slater must look back on this film with a sense of longing because he has not been given as good a project since (Churchill: The Hollywood Years, anyone?).Patricia Arquette is as cute as anything and perfectly fits her role. Call me crazy, but she really seems to be enjoying playing the \"hooker-with-a-heart-of-gold\". In fact, everyone seems to be loving the hell out of a superb script. The scene between Dennis Hopper and Christopher Walken is one of cinemas greatest ever scenes! The famously egotistical Val Kilmer goes almost unseen as Elvis - sorry, The Mentor - and Brad Pitts now-famous Cleaning Products line was a brilliant ad-lib. Gary Oldman as the white-rasta Drexl is the epitome of nastiness. Even Samuel L Jackson gets a high billing in the credits, but is in the film for less than 5 minutes! Genius. By the way, check out the DVD extended/deleted scene scenes for a longer discussion on cunnilingus. It's hilarious.All in all, this is a collection of brilliantly written scenes, filled with memorable quotes and held together by a sweet, believable and totally mad storyline with a better-than-A-list-cast. Even the tragically underused Ed Lauter gets a look-in. Tom Sizemore and Chris Penn excel as the cops on the trail. The weakest point is Bronson Pinchot, but even he keeps pace well.My only regret is that QT didn't direct it himself. Scott did an EXCELLENT job, but I would like to see QT's version.QT to remake True Romance and Natural Born Killers: The pressure-campaign starts here!10 1/2 out of 10!",

Quentin Tarrentino at his finest, we all loved pulp fiction, but in my opinion this film is far greater!!!! The casting is phenomenal, the acting is superior and the music just blows me away! When the film kicks in Patricia Arquette is narrating the intro and it's like poetry! This film will move you! This film has everything! It's funny, sad, dramatic, dark, twisted and clever I gave this move 10/10, my favourite film being the Godfather it should definitely be up there in the top 100 IMDb films!

A couple minutes into the movie, having watched a guy attempting to flirt with a girl, I literally thought to myself that whoever wrote this is a gifted writer.Of course it was written by Quentin Tarantino. Apparently, it is his first completed screenplay, but it already displays all the distinguishing characteristics of his later works: the unorthodox yet incisively fitting dialogue, the numerous pop culture references, the eclectic mix of humor and ultraviolent action, the nifty interlocking plot turns and twists, the colorful villains and the tough female protagonist.Even though it was directed by Tony Scott-a very good director in his own right-, I feel it is still a Tarantino film because I noticed his fingerprints just a couple minutes in without even realizing it.If one is not disturbed by the at times extreme violence, it can be enjoyed as a highly entertaining modern fairy tale.",

Technically Quentin Tarantino's first, since he wrote it which is impressive cause it's well written with heart and a joyful soundtrack that makes me smile.

            "content": "\"True Romance\" is a high speed crime thriller with plenty of action, romance and dark humour and a collection of characters that make every scene bristle with excitement and interest. The plot is fascinating throughout, the dialogue is witty and entertaining and the star-studded cast deliver some great performances. A story about a young couple on the run may not seem strikingly original but this one is told with so much flamboyance, dynamism and panache that it's completely irresistible and tremendously enjoyable to watch.Clarence Worley (Christian Slater) is totally obsessed with comic books, movies and Elvis Presley and seems to have very few friends. Whilst he's spending his birthday alone at a cinema watching a Sonny Chiba triple feature, he gets into conversation with an attractive blonde called Alabama Whitman (Patricia Arquette) and they end up spending the night together at Clarence's place. It later emerges that Alabama is a call girl who'd been paid to entertain Clarence by the man who owns the book store where he works. Despite this unpromising start to their relationship, Clarence and Alabama fall in love and get married the following day.Clarence is a guy who periodically has conversations with Elvis' ghost who acts as a mentor to him and during one such conversation Elvis advises him of the need to kill Alabama's pimp, a dreadlocked sadist called Drexl (Gary Oldman). After telling Drexl about Alabama's change of status and that she won't be working for him any more, things soon descend into violence and Clarence kills the pimp and one of his henchmen before taking, what he believes to be, Alabama's suitcase of clothes with him. When the couple discover that the case actually contains $500,000 worth of uncut cocaine, they decide to leave Detroit and head off to California.Clarence plans to use his old friend, an aspiring actor called Dick Ritchie (Michael Rapaport), to make the necessary connections to a Hollywood producer who is likely to be interested in purchasing the coke. Unfortunately, a number of complications develop during the setting up of the deal and things get difficult as it soon becomes clear that a couple of L.A. detectives as well as the gangsters who owned the cocaine are on their trail.Quentin Tarantino's script is an outstanding feature of this movie and contains all the intensity and sparkle that normally characterises his work as well as a good supply of witty one-liners. There are three scenes that particularly stand out. The first is one in which Clarence's father gets interrogated by a high-ranking Sicilian gangster, the second is a violent confrontation involving Alabama and a hit-man and the third is a Mexican standoff which brings together , Clarence and his associates, the gangsters, the police and the Hollywood producer and his bodyguards in a situation where tensions are running extremely high and everyone is heavily armed. These scenes are all incredibly violent but, especially in the first and last scenes, the way in which humour is used is both skillful and very effective.The entire cast in this exceptionally entertaining movie is excellent with Dennis Hopper, Christopher Walken and Gary Oldman providing the most impressive performances and Brad Pitt standing out as Dick's perpetually stoned roommate.",

            "content": "Clarence Worley (Christian Slater) falls in love with call-girl Alabama (Patricia Arquette) and ends up getting married to her. When he hears of how brutally her pimp has treated her, Clarence has a violent showdown with him and Clarence takes from him what he believes to be Alabama's clothes (which turns out to be a suitcase full of cocaine). With the assistance of Clarence's estranged father, Clarence and Alabama flee with the cocaine with the intention of selling it to a major film producer. However stealing drugs carries major repercussions and Clarence and Alabama find themselves being pursued by both the owners of the drugs and the police.Quentin Tarantino penned the screenplay for this film and what's most surprising here is that Tarantino merely serves up a fairly average script (one which lacks his usual creative flair). The story plays out as a sort of Bonnie and Clyde style road movie and pretty much every other drug related crime film in existence so there is very little in the way of originality here. Whilst the 'average' story is a weakness, thankfully it isn't a major one as the script is still interesting enough to make sure that one's attention never wanders.One problem I did have with this film is that I felt that it wasn't quite as exciting as it could have been; the moment Christopher Walken's character showed up I expected him and his goons to terrorise Arquette and Slater more or less continuously, but aside from the one scene with Arquette and Gandolfini and the showdown at the end this is never really explored and it just meant that the film lacked that extra bit of intensity required to put it among the top tier of crime films.Despite the above, part of the reason that this film does succeed is down to many well-known faces who command attention throughout; Walken is one of the highlights in this film and although his appearance is brief he makes damn sure it's a memorable one. The scene with Walken and Hopper was menacing and chilling (the two men are laughing at each other for a few minutes which was actually quite unnerving). This scene also contains some excellent 'Tarantinoesque' dialogue which is one thing that made Pulp Fiction both bizarre and fascinating. It's a shame that we're not treated to more of that here to be honest. Arquette is also excellent here and despite her being an accomplice of sorts she still shows a sort of vulnerability that endears us towards her. The rest of the supporting cast were OK, but I have to admit that Gary Oldman's performance here was a little embarrassing and for me no white man should try to be black. Oldman was fun here, but I suspect that this is a performance that he'd rather forget.Tony Scott's direction is also very good and he certainly doesn't hold back in trying to bring some of Tarantino's vision to the big screen (the scene where Arquette and Gandolfini are fighting is shocking, brutal and realistic and is spoilt slightly towards the end of this scene by Scott allowing things to get silly and not knowing when to quit whilst he's ahead). The showdown at the end was silly, but at least it was fun.For me, True Romance is a fairly average crime story but it's elevated by some magnificent performances, impressive direction, brutal style and a sense of fun that underlies all the menace. Worth watching for sure, but I definitely felt there was room for improvement.",

The film feels cohesive (to me) and employs funny differentiations to other films on similar subject matters: drug deals (the Dr Zhivago conversation is one of my favorites), violence, romance, friendship, family, trust, loyalty are all important themes that are explored throughout whiteout a flaw.

I've liked all the Tarantino films Tarantino has scripted and directed, and I like \"Natural Born Killers\" a lot, a film he wrote but didn't direct. Originally, Bill Lustig was set to direct \"True Romance\", but Scott ended up with the project. The result? Cinematic dynamite! This is outlaw cinema with an A-list cast and budget. It is an intense, compelling, adrenalin-pumped masterpiece that is one of the most re-watchable films in my collection. There are so many great sequences and the characters, thanks to Quentin's sharp, inventive screenplay, are all distinctive and memorable. Christian Slater's \"cute meet\" with Patricia Arquette, in a cinema screening Chiba's \"The Streetfighter\", is just fantastic. Slater's across-the-bar conversation where he admits that he'd f**k Elvis is hilarious and perversely understandable. Gary Oldman's intro scene where he and his pals steal a case of cocaine and chat about eating a woman's p***y and a** is pure grindhouse. Dennis Hopper's big dramatic scene with Chris Walken is a knockout, as are all of Saul Rubinek's scenes. Val Kilmer is a great Elvis and James Gandolfino, as the humble baddie who beats Arquette senseless in one of the film's most vicious scenes, is give-the-man-an-Oscar great. Of course, cinematic masterpieces like \"True Romance\" don't get Oscars. Because all the elements gel so beautifully, why exactly TR works so well is not plain to see. It just does. It's high gloss ex-, blax- and sexploitation all stirred into one steaming cauldron of gunfire, bloodshed, sexy sleaze, hilarity, and the naive, glorious idealism of youth. It has a devil-may-care nihilism about it and an energy level that is rare for a film sent through the Hollywod machine to mainstream distribution. Not surprisingly, it didn't do great box office, but it's done good business on DVD and been rediscovered. Scott, when saddled with good screenplays, like \"Man on Fire\", \"Revenge\" and \"Spy Game\", is more than capable of delivering first class entertainment. When he's staring into the face of crap like \"Domino\", he camouflages the manure with bloated stylization. \"True Romance\" is his best film, and one of the best films ever produced in Hollywood. Oh, I almost forgot, Brad Pitt's \"Floyd\" character is simply, well, untouchable.",

It might have been part of something nice to begin with but there's no way you'd touch it now. That's True Romance - a gutter trash fiction roller-coaster powered by pop-culture references and overdone Tarantino dialogue. The story and execution are so adolescent and grim that I am surprised that it wasn't actually written and directed by an angry 15-year-old with mental health problems.Since James Gandofini died a few days ago and since it's actually Tony Scott's birthday today I figured I would give this film another go. Time has not been kind to True Romance, even by 1993 standards the film looks dated. This was the fourth, and last, film Tony Scott made with cinematographer Jeffrey Kimball with whom he always used smoky diffusion to fog up the frame. It doesn't look good.The story has Christian Slater's comic-book geek get together with Patricia Arquette's dim-witted hooker and go on a killing spree for a pathetic amount of quick, easy money. Apparently it was one half of Natural Born Killer's before Tarantino split it into a new screenplay, but he forgot to distance Clarence and Alabama from Mickey and Mallory. True Romance is a thoroughly ugly, sadistic, mean-spirited, nasty film filled with characters who have absolutely no morals or redeeming qualities (well, Patricia Arquette has a couple attached to her chest). There's no one to root for or identify with. Why should I care what happens to any of these psychopaths? And where's the romance? Making Clarence and Alabama have sex in awkward locations or have them kiss and make-out in every other scene doesn't mean that they are high on love. I'm not feeling any romance with this one. There's no sense of liberation or exciting new chances, just gloom and darkness.The saving grace comes in the form of many cameos from Christopher Walken, Gary Oldman, Dennis Hopper, and Saul Rubinek (playing, but pretending not to, a Joel Silver-type producer). Chris Penn and Tom Sizemore pop up but they don't get a chance to bring much to the story as it is already building to a climax by that point. I can't recommend this any fans of crime fiction, romantics, or even fans of Tony Scott. Sure the sycophantic Tarantino fans will get a kick out of it, but I doubt I will ever be watching this reprehensible junk ever again.",

            "review_title": "Once Upon A Time In Detroit",
            "content": "Once Upon A Time In DetroitA heart beat of Noir.The title sequence for True Romance magically conveys us to the bleak cold desolate vortex of the Rust Belt 1990's Detroit, but also back a million plus years to the time when fantastic tales were spun by ancient man around the first campfire. Only in the here and now, the fire is scrap wood fed and in an oil drum in a vacant lot surrounded by hobos, outcasts, and scavengers and the fantastic tale is offered with rising sparks and smoke up to the eternal night. A Neo Noir tale.Very few of the classic noirs used the female voice over, one that readily comes to mind is Claire Trevor's in Raw Deal. This neo noir story is triggered in one long flashback by a voice over narration by ex-call girl femme fatale Alabama Whitman (Patricia Arquette). Arquette here is downright outstanding, if ever there was a character that captured that effervescent spirit of Marilyn Monroe's various characters (and updates that quality to the 90s and makes it her own) in a film it's Arquette's Alabama in True Romance. She is a blond, buxom, bombshell, a \"firecracker\" the \"shot from the front\" sequence where she jiggles down the courthouse steps rivals Marilyn's classic \"shot from behind\" wiggles from Some Like It Hot and Niagara. You just sense that if this were still the big studio days and she was under contract she would have been typecast into many of these kind of parts in quick succession at the peak of that phase of her beauty, Arquette might have become iconic but would the price have been tragedy as it was for Marilyn? As it is her performance is just a one off. The studio days are long gone and the atmosphere is catch-as-catch-can and Arquette did not get another similar Neo Noir role until her double parts as Alice & Rene in Lost Highway. I guess time will be the judge if contract stars of the Studios or those of the new corporate deal system will be best remembered in the long run. Arquette here ranges from sweet and coy, to desperate and deadly, her transformation into Athena with her Amazonian like war scream is chilling. The tale unfolds as quasi comic book/martial arts/Elvis geek Clarence gets shot out of the saddle by a B-girl at a local tavern. Later at a late-night triple bill Sonny Chiba show, Alabama, in a contrived maneuver spills her popcorn over the seat on Clarence. She expresses her dismay in an instantly lovable cutesy/ditzy manor and is soon climbing over the seat and settling in beside him. They soon connect and later over pie and coffee in a diner begin to fall for each other. Clarence takes her back to his pad above the comic book store where they make love. Later Alabama confesses that she is a call girl and was paid and sent by Clarence's boss as his birthday present. Clarence is not mad at all says it's the best present he ever had and that it was not just the physical part but he never had so much fun with a girl ever before in his life. They pledge their love for each other and get married. The whole sequence is wonderfully written and rings so true that you suspect it is somewhat biographical. Clarence, (Christian Slater) in probably his best role, watch his dialogs with Alabama and his father. He is \"cooler than cool\" as he follows his personal rockabilly espirito Elvis in the way he deals with situations and travels life's highways. . Elvis tells him to confront Alabama's pimp Drexl and it's this meeting that sends the tale spiraling into Noirsville. The rest of the cast is superb, Michael Rapaport as Dick Ritchie\u00a0a struggling numb nuts want to be actor who lives with stoner Floyd\u00a0(Brad Pitt) who has a plastic honey bear bong. Bronson Pinchot is the weasel Hollywood yes man Elliot Blitzer\u00a0to producer Lee Donowitz\u00a0(Saul Rubinek). Dennis Hopper is Clifford Worley, Clarence's security guard father who sings Country Western songs while making his rounds and lives in a trailer park wedged between the river and the railroad tracks. Mafioso Don Vincenzo Coccotti\u00a0(Christopher Walken ) is a capo for Blue Lou Boyle. Virgil\u00a0(James Gandolfini ) is a reflective hit-man. Gary Oldman is delightfully over the top as courier and pimp Drexl Spivey. Chris Penn as Detective Nicky Dimes and \u00a0Tom Sizemore as Detective Cody Nicholson\u00a0are Gung ho LA cops. Samuel L. Jackson is Big Don a spastic druggie with some memorable lines, and Val Kilmer is \"Mentor\" (Elvis).Ably directed by Tony Scott with beautiful cinematography by Jeffrey L. Kimball. A great soundtrack\u00a0by Hans Zimmer stitches all the segments together. True Romance is one of those films that prove that every once in a while Noir has a pulse. A fun flick with abundant eye candy 9/10",

            "content": "True Romance. Tarantino's first, and ironically enough most original, movie. Though directed by Tony Scott (Top Gun, Enemy of the State) the film remains very faithful to Tarantino's original conception. With the exception of the ending and the trademark Tarantino non-linear storytelling being taken out. There are oh so many things in this movie that Tarantino's later works reference to that it's like a Tarantino fan boy treat! Which I am not anymore. But during my one year time as a fan boy I did read the script of this movie and this was before I even saw the movie. So this being so very faithful to the script you can imagine how psyched i was seeing this movie. I was not disappointed.The movie starts off in not so sunny Detroit with our anti-hero Clarence. Clarence lives a very lonely life with comic books, Kung Fu movies and Elvis as his greatest passions. But one day a woman named Alabama comes into his life. They fall in love instantly and armed with a 38 caliber revolver, a suitcase full of cocaine and most of all love, they set off to sunny Hollywood to try to sell it off and live happily ever after.Many people brand this movie as a narcissistic teenage boy's wet dream. Well it's not. This is supposed to be a fairy tale and it so is. I mean he's a film geek and she's a hot girl. Well it turns out this hot girl likes movies and comics to so they get married. That's every man's dream. Tarantino didn't set out to make a fairy tale when he wrote it but the changes that Tony Scott made (as small as they were) really changed the theme of the movie and made it lighter and more like a fairy tale. Personally I would have really liked to see what the movie would have been like if Tarantino had directed it.This is one of those movies which has a wonderful cast. First there's Christian Slater (....well...True Romance) who plays the character of Clarence very good. Had this been directed by Tarantino in the early nineties the part would have been played by Tarantino himself. Slater plays it with a certain style and this really is his best film ever. I wonder why he doesn't get better parts in movies. Then there's Dennis Hopper (Land of the Dead, Speed) who plays his father in a couple of scenes. The whole movie is worth watching just for him. Gary Oldman (L\u00e9on, Lost in Space) plays a very cool role as Drexl the pimp. Good old Gary. Christopher Walken has a small role and plays it very calm and cool. Michael Rapaport, (Friends) who we all know from Friends and Deep Blue Sea, Plays struggling actor Dick Richie and gives a solid performance. And last but most certainly not least there's Chris Penn (rest in peace) as Detective Nicky Dimes. He plays the part with such coolness and style and the film would not be what it is if he weren't in it.\"People have asked me: 'So would you ever do a romance movie?' like that's not what I would do. 'Well, I did a romantic movie, True Romance.' 'No, no, I mean like a real romantic movie.' 'Well that is a real romantic movie.' 'No, like one without violence?' 'Well there'll be a lot of things in any movie I do that will be contradictory, but anybody who's a fan of the movie can tell you, the title - True Romance - is not ironic...this is true romance.'\" - Quentin Tarantino.",

It's the suitcase full of cocaine that everyone's after and, like, who gives a bloody damn how many people have to die for somebody, anybody, to get their greedy mitts on this jackpot.Some people tend to put the blame for True Romance's considerable shortcomings squarely onto the shoulders of its director, Tony Scott (Ridley's bro'). But, personally, I think that Scott (who has clearly proved his competent directorial abilities, time and again) could only do what he could do, considering the dismal source of the inferior script that he was expected to work with in order to make something entertaining out of it.",

Christian Slater and Patricia Arquette play a couple that is supposed to be the villain of the story, but due to its inexplicable power of captivating, becomes the movie's main stars. Even thought they do a lot of bad things throughout the story, every time they seem to be in danger-- or every time they're getting beaten up--, I felt extremely thrilled-- and sorry for them. Furthermore, this picture runs with a GREAT soundtrack, which sometimes mutes the characters without spoiling the movie's speed; on the contrary, it gets more and more entertaining and... cooler! The only reason why I don't give it a higher rating is because of its surfeit of violence; sometimes I believe Tarantino could have been calmer in this romance, but it's still one of his memorable works.",

I really enjoyed more than anything the great performances from a really amazing ensemble cast. The fast and clever language often found in Tarantino movies is heard all throughout this film. The plot and story often feel predictable and the unfolding of events lead to a conclusion that is relatively obvious from halfway into the film. I didn't find myself captivated by the story but I was invested in the smart directing and writing in several of the individual scenes. Multiple scenes in the film stand out with the Tarantino dialogue and interesting direction from Tony Scott including the showdown at Drexel's and the interrogation scene between Christopher Walken and Dennis Hopper. The closer the ending came the less the film seemed to engage me. Despite the story not entirely working for me, I really enjoyed many of the individual scenes. It is clear from the story and style of the film that there is an influence of 70s cinema with films like Terrence Malick's Badlands, referenced throughout the movie. If Howard Hawks was right and all you need to have a good film is \"three great scenes and no bad scenes\" than this film is definitely worth checking out.",

It stars Christian Slater, Patricia Arquette, Dennis Hopper, Brad Pitt, Val Kilmer, Gary Oldman, Michael Rapaport, Christopher Walken, James Gandolfini, Chris Penn, Tom Sizemore, Bronson Pinchot and Saul Rubinek. Music is by Hans Zimmer and cinematography by Jeffery L. Kimball. Comic book store clerk Clarence Worley (Slater) falls in love with call girl Alabama Whitman (Arquette) when she turns up at the movie theatre as one of his birthday presents. Marriage is quick but as the whirlwind romance gathers apace, complications quickly follow in the form of psycho drug dealers and the mob! It's still speculated on how True Romance would have panned out had Tarantino directed his own screenplay, but really in the grand scheme of things it doesn't matter. For True Romance is a wildly exciting fusion of lovers on the lam premise with violence a go go thrills. Director Scott did a bang up job bringing Tarantino's screenplay to life, even making a couple of narrative changes that suits (QT agrees) the picture no end. People often get hung up on the fact that Scott had previously helmed Top Gun, Beverly hills Cop II and Days of Thunder, citing these as reasons that Scott was wrong for the material, yet the film he did immediately before True Romance was The Last Boy Scout, a thrilling and muscular actioner that pings with sharp savvy dialogue scripted by Shane Black. It was the perfect trial run for True Romance, and Scott proved to be a wise and cohesive choice for the material. He also expertly marshalled a large ensemble cast, garnering career high turns from Slater and Arquette in the process. Almost everything clicks into place on True Romance, it never lacks for kinetic thrills or edge of the seat drama. In turn it likes to grab you around the throat with some wince inducing violence, cunningly drawing you in to root for a couple of lovers who will do anything for each other, while simultaneously causing carnage for all they come into contact with. There's odd ball characters galore (Oldman and Pitt excelling in this area), exquisite set-pieces and dialogue so sharp you could cut a steak with it. From conversations between Clarence and his imaginary Elvis (Kilmer) mentor, to iconography unbound with one of the 90s great sequences that sees Walken's mob boss verbally joust with Hopper as Clarence's stoic father, it's a film as rich in the art of vocal acting as it is in eye splintering gloss. All that and it's a clinically beautiful love story as well! A wet dream fantasy of QT for sure, and if you wanna be churlish? Then there should have been more room made for Sizemore and Penn's glorious coppers. Hell we could even complain about the editing being a touch too slam-bang at times\u0085But nah! Small complaints be damned, the meeting of Tarantino the writer and Scott the director delivers neo-noir goodies galore. In fact it's a film that just gets better with age. 9/10",

Slater plays a loner, a young'un with a love for comics and old kung-fu movies who meets, and sleeps with a beautiful young woman one stormy night. He learns that she came to him as part of a set-up, (his boss thought he needed to get laid) but they soon fall in love and get married.

Unlike Quentin's feeling about his script for Natural Born Killers, which he blamed Oliver Stone for ruining, Tarantino liked the late Tony Scott's version of his script. The visuals are all Scott. They lack the thoughtful pace and pauses of a Tarantino directed film; that doesn't mean it isn't good-just not Tarantino. It is fast paced. It is violent. The strength of it is also its actors. Slater is at his best. Arquette is lovable. Oldman's politically incorrect and crazy performance is one for the books. Dennis Hopper is Dennis Hopper, and that is never bad. Add a young Michael Rappaport and Brad Pitt. James Gandolfini too. Blink and you'll miss a younger Samuel L. Jackson. Christopher Walken is at the top of his game.

The script and Christian Slater remain the best parts of this film. It was interesting from a layman's point of view. Not as wild or inventive as Quentin Tarantino's future scripts, but definitely acceptable.Strange how we can root for the bad guy, as we did here. They're not perfect, or completely good/bad to put in the plus column, but still we wanted these newlyweds to succeed.An all-star cast, perfect for movie lovers to jizz over, they do what they needed to in their roles. Unforgettable? Not really, but fun to watch as the amateur crime drama unfolds. Recommended for 90s crime-movie-lovers.",

            "content": "\"True Romance\" starts out peculiar enough to make it a tad unique and special. An Elvis loving comicbook store manager named Clarence Worley (Christian Slater) has a rendezvous with a woman named Alabama (Patricia Arquette). What seemed like a happenstance sexual encounter was really a pay-for-sex transaction set up by Clarence's boss. What could not have been known is that they would fall in love and get married the next day. That was as cute as it got, and IMO, as good as it got.It only devolved from there.Though Alabama was now Mrs. Worley and had no intentions of ever going back to being a \"call girl,\" Clarence couldn't release the thought of her ex-pimp, Drexl (Gary Oldman). So groused was he by the thought of her pimp, he decided to go kill him. Why? For violence. This was a Tarantino written movie after all, so we got plenty of violence and plenty white people uttering the N-word.Clarence, in an effort to get Alabama's belongings after blowing away Drexl and his bodyguard, actually took a suitcase full of uncut cocaine. So, after having become a killer, Clarence also became a drug dealer and the whole affair was \"so cool\" to Alabama, who was mentally stuck in kindergarten.As all of these different characters entered the movie in one way or another-- being connected to the drugs in one way or another-- I knew that there would be a lot of blood and that Clarence and Alabama would live HEA (happily ever after).That's precisely what happened as a henchman (James Gandolfini) couldn't dispose of a petite blond. As an actor (Bronson Pinchot) couldn't help but expose all the coke he had. As a producer (Saul Rubinek) couldn't help but buy a suitcase full of coke. As a police squad bungled a drug bust. As a mob walked in on said drug bust to turn it into the OK Corral. And as a heartbroken near-widow decided to shoot a cop. It was a bloody disgusting finale that was supposed to be poetic and romantic in its bloodiness.I do believe you can have righteous, poetic, or even romantic bloodshed. This wasn't it and it just made me befuddled as to how it has a 7.9 rating.",

'True Romance' makes that very clear.In this early work of Tarantino, he treats viewers to an avalanche of action and escalating stakes: A kung fu movie buff who works at a comic store (vaguely reminiscent of who Tarantino saw himself to be in his younger days) meets a call girl, falls in love, confronts her pimp, and ultimately flees to California with his new lover and a half million dollars worth of cocaine in a briefcase.The couple are a perfect pairing because they can match each other's crazy. They appear to genuinely fall for each other and support each other's wild choices. Actually, they seem to be turned on by each other's craziness. With a tiny excusal of their warped perception of reality, it becomes easy enough to like these two. If liking them is asking too much, at the very least viewers will be interested in what happens to them.Of course, that is not to say these are good people. Their behavior is questionable at best. But, moral judgment isn't really the point of this movie. It's an elaborate and entertaining story told with witty dialogue and explosive violence.In other words, it's a Tarantino movie.One more thing: the music. Director Tony Scott opted for a score rather than the classic soundtracks Tarantino routinely assembles in his later movies. It turns out the score was the perfect choice. The delightful melody provides dashes of much needed levity in the midst of the carnage.",

            "content": "(Minor spoilers)Tarantinolatry got so out of hand during the '90s that a number of people actually took this absurd movie for a masterstroke, even though Tarantino only wrote the screenplay for it.Clarence Worley is a nebbish who meets Alabama who is (sigh) a Hooker With A Heart Of Gold.  They decide to get married.  It becomes necessary to kill Alabama's pimp, Drexl (Gary Oldman, whose amusing performance is one of the few enjoyable moments in the movie) so the pair can be together.  However, they decide to grab Drexl's huge stash of cocaine to finance their future together.  Needless to say, this causes a plethora of criminals to try to kill them and get the drugs back.  Also needless to say, the plethora fails to do so.  Clarence magically transforms from a nebbish into a Tough Guy, whose strength is as the strength of ten because he spouts \"cool\" profanities.  When you spout cool profanities, gangsters who are pointing their guns at you do not shoot you when you draw a gun.  They just rack their slides menacingly (this cliche is known to bad movie fans as Superfluous Racking).Clarence and Alabama do not have any interesting or memorable characteristics.  There is no reason for the audience to root for them to make it to the end.  Who wants to see these two who intend to finance their married life by helping some hapless addict kill himself (or worse, helping to start some kid on the habit), enjoy the fruits of their scheme?  Cliche characters alone do not make the movie any worse than an ordinary action movie, but these characters are not just cliches, but unlikeable cliches. \nNor do the supporting characters make any more sense than the leads. Christopher Walken's Vince Coccotti tortures Clarence's father in order to learn where Clarence is, and then, bizarrely, kills him without first gaining any information whatsoever from him.  But first, we are subjected to a reprehensible, epithet-laden racist spiel from Clarence's dad, apparently intended to be funny.  Unlike in PULP FICTION, where the racial epithets could be excused as not meant to be offensive, there is no question in this case that Clarence's dad, who is being painted as a \"good guy\" and is intended to engage the audience's sympathy, is deliberately trying to provoke Coccotti by suggesting that he has black ancestors (and it is presumed as a matter of course that an implication of black ancestry is belittling and undesirable).  If this were even the slightest bit amusing, it might be forgivable, but it isn't, despite the laughter of the characters on screen which is intended to cue the audience into laughter in much the same way as the canned laughter on a TV sitcom.  TRUE ROMANCE could have been a bland action movie.  By ladling on racism, an extra helping of unrealism and stupidity, and characters who are not only unimaginative but also repellent, it makes itself much, much worse.  Wish fulfillment movies can be pleasant, even if silly; the shape of Tarantino's wish fulfillment fantasy is disgusting.Rating: * out of ****.",

Oddly enough, my top ten favourites do not include a single Tarantino-directed movie - I honestly wonder if all his writing would be this good with a competent director, like Scott, or if the uncredited Avary's influence was what made this particular movie stand out for me.The story is nothing new or original. Boy meets girl. Boy falls in love with girl. S*** happens. It's almost a traditional yarn, but so lovingly spun that it deserves to be a classic. It's not life-changing genius. It's not world-shaping art. It's never going to be the subject of a classical literature degree... but it *is* engrossing, entertaining, enjoyable, and honestly, utterly, undeniably romantic.The cast is brilliant, and expertly placed to shine in their respective roles. Almost every line is quotable and no scene is wasted. Sure, the dialogue is recognisably Tarantino, but it's just not the same winding monotony that taints the interplay in his own directing ventures - it flows well and doesn't get in the way of real acting. Exchanges between characters feel natural.Yes, it has violence (this is an action movie after all), but it serves to enhance the elements of peril that pull the viewer into the plight of our plucky couple. The most harrowing moments in this movie involve the least gun-play, deriving their impact from strong performances and believable pain or sacrifice. Despite some tried-and-true Hollywood-style action too, there is an appreciable element of reality and plausibility that makes suspension of disbelief an effortless endeavour.This movie has compelling characterisation, perfect pace, well-directed dialogue, an appropriate measure of action, and characters you can really root-for... not to mention that this cynical critic can't watch it without almost (not quite, but almost) getting all weepy.If you're a Tarantino fan and you haven't watched this, you may be neglecting his best work.

Jackson, Val Kilmer, Brad Pitt, Bronson Pinchotand and Saul Rubinek.\"True Romance\" (1993) is a crime drama/thriller/romance and black comedy directed by Tony Scott (younger brother of Ridley) and written by Quentin Tarantino. The latter sold the script to fund his first movie \"Reservoir Dogs\" (1992). It contains the ultra-violence/gore that Tarantino is known for, along with his satirical, comic book style that makes it more amusing than shocking.While the all-star cast is incredible and there are several great scenes, something keeps \"True Romance\" from the top tier of \"Pulp Fiction\" (1994) and \"Jackie Brown\" (1997). I suppose it doesn't help that the protagonist's sudden transformation isn't convincing, not to mention that what he does is unnecessary and perilous (i.e. stupid), which turns him into a bit of a creepy nutzoid. But that's just me.Imagine being blown away by the greatest album by a band and then purchasing their previous album, which is good, but not in the same league. You like it, but you're also a little letdown. That's how \"True Romance\" comes across after viewing \"Pulp Fiction.\" Nevertheless, it's still worthwhile if you don't mind this genre.The script was originally written in a nonlinear structure, which Tarantino is known for, but Tony Scott changed the story to chronological, as well as altered the ending, which made for a morally confused message. Quentin's original version would've worked better, preferably directed by him.The film runs 1 hour, 59 minutes, and was shot in Detroit and the Los Angeles area.GRADE: B-",

The only problem is, the coke belongs to the mob and so much of the film is spent dodging the mafia. And in the end, the foul-mouthed mob has a showdown with the foul-mouthed cops as well as some foul-mouthed security guards and the foul-mouthed \"heroes\"--resulting in perhaps the bloodiest and most violent five minutes in film--and looking much like the recent massacre at Virginia Tech. And to top it all off, the film then is sure to REWARD the antiheroes and kill off all the gangsters and cops--as if there was some sort of moral equivalence here!Just WHO is the audience for this film? Is it possible this film was made as a tool to determine who LIKES this sort of violent stuff in order to lock them away where they can't hurt anyone?!?! I doubt it--like most of the super-super violent crap from Hollywood, its sole purpose is to \"entertain\". When I want this much extreme violence, totally unlikable and sick characters, etc., I really worry about my mental health and the health of this country. What is wrong with America that we put up with crap like TRUE ROMANCE?! Are we really all that different from the ancient Romans who were entertained by seeing people torn to pieces before their very eyes?! Apparently not. If you are one of the ones entertained by this film, apart from a few clever moments here and there, what is it that's so entertaining? Seeing people die?!PS--One aspect of the film I did like was when Christian Slater was apparently having psychotic hallucinations where Elvis came to give him advice. This was a variation on Bogey coming to Woody Allen in PLAY IT AGAIN, SAM. I just wish these Elvis scenes had occurred more often--seeing a mad man getting advice from Elvis to kill people was pretty compelling.",

Another amazing aspect to the film is the soundtrack, what a nostalgic trip. Christian Slater plays the perfect nerdy anti-hero and one that you can't help but root for and secretly want to be! Patricia Arquette is also fantastic with an absolutely exceptional performance by Gary Oldman, although he only grabs a couple scenes but boy talk about electric! This is why Oldman is a legend. Also worth noting James Gandolfini's superb outing, the man was diabolical. All this culminates to one of the best \" Mexican stand-offs\" i've ever seen. A perfect film inside and out!",

            "content": "Quentin Tarantino has long been one of, if not the, person in the film industry that I loathe the most. Despite him not directing this one, I had always avoided it just because I didn't want to deal with another one of his shallow disasters of a script. However, I figured at this point I should at least watch it for Gary Oldman's performance, since a ton of people consider it one of their favorites from him. Oldman did not disappoint. As a white pimp who tries to act black, he crafted yet another unique character in his long career, one totally removed from any other character he's ever played. He absorbs so deeply into this character and it serves as another example in the long line of roles that make him the first actor people think of when they hear the word \"chameleon\".Unfortunately he's only in it for about ten minutes and then I had to deal with the rest of this awful mess, which is pretty much everything I hate in a Tarantino screenplay. If you're not going to do anything new then you should at least do the old things in an interesting way, but that sure isn't the case here. The whole thing is a pathetically thin old-as-bones story with Tarantino's trademark dialogue that so many people eat up but I find to be disastrously artificial and awkward. No actors would be able to pull off the kind of absurd, unrealistic dialogue that he feeds them here, but a lot of the cast here feels like they aren't even trying to make it seem anything but awful.Some of the supporting players do all right in their brief screentimes, but Christian Slater and Patricia Arquette are terrible. It doesn't help that they have thin, completely one-dimensional characters (and in Arquette's case, a totally inconsistent one) but they just make matters worse with some abysmal portrayals. This one was a real chore; a completely shallow, needless exercise with some scenes that go on so long I thought I had died and fallen into hell.",

Very important is the fact that this is a movie you can watch over and over again. \"True Romance\" suggests a romantic love story. It is about love and the consequences of this love. After several viewings you will discover more themes. I know that Quentin Tarantino wrote the screenplay and you will recognize his influence:wonderful dialog and tribute to Hong Kong and Japanese movies (\"Streetfighter Trilogy\" with Sonny Chiba is playing in the cinema where Clarence meets Alabama,At Clarence's home Alabama is watching \" a better tomorrow 2\" from John Woo).

Especially cool is watching it with someone who's never seen it before. Which I sometimes do whenever possible. True Romance saddles up fine with Pulp Fiction and Fight Club, which I must say are number two and three on my all-time favorite movie list.\nClarence and Alabama are stupid, yes, as many critics are wont to say. But it wouldn't be fun any other way. In other words it is not a cerebral film.\nAnd I've grown to love them both.\nGary Old man gives his best over-the-top performance ever. Nevermind his tor-de-force as Winston Churchill last year. Watch and you won't disagree\nDennis Hopper, as Clarence's dad, brings the film down to earth for a few-- as he's forgivably smitten with Alabama. And he utters the greatest dialogue in a film since Anthony Hopkins as Hannibal Lector described eating a human being. Hateful, hateful dialogue but he pulls it off with a smile on his face as he's soon dispatched by Christopher Walken.\nLove Quentin Tarantino's writing.\nThe grittiest scene belongs to Patricia Arquette. Alabama is discovered alone in the motel by none other than a mad, mad Tony Soprano. James Gandolfini is a superb menace. Waking up to see him in my room would make me piss my pants but Alabama ain't going down easy.\nThe climax is a bit disappointing. In that all films no matter how great must come to an end.",

Clarence (Slater) is set up with a call girl Alabama (Arquette) for a birthday present. They fall for each other and Clarence looks to even things out with Drexl (Oldman) which leads to a rather violent conclusion. This sets the tone for the movie and anybody that has a squemish nature should steer clear of the movie. Some people may also find some of the language a bit industrial and it's not always politically correct in terms of race and gender.The ensemble cast put in some outstanding performances and the film is gripping from start to finish. If I was being really nit picking I'd suggest the ending was a bit weak, but it's just so good upto that point who cares. I'm sure Tarantino would have liked to have shoved this script away on his mantlepiece for a few years, because it knocks the spots off Kill Bill. With non stop action, great acting, unfussy direction and spellbinding script this is undoubtedly one of the finest modern day films to come out of Hollywood. 10/10",

I also remember that I loved the movie thoroughly, and this time, I felt the same. It feels like a Tarantino movie because it is - his writing is clear, and if you ask me, it's one of Tarantino's best works. May I also say that Patricia Arquette in this is one of the great babes of my lifetime, if not of all time - simply stunning. Visionary, fat-free directing by Tony Scott, electric pacing designed to stimulate consistently, oodles of over-the-top sequences, a zany score by Hans Zimmer that at time reaches into realms of emotional beauty as well, and a plot structure that manages to say incredibly simple but feel completely progressive the entire time. And so many of the incredible ensemble cast only need one or two scenes to put in a classic performance, from Oldman to Walken to Hopper to Sizemore and so on. And Slater is as likable as ever. It's his Heathers character taken to an even further tier, yet in a more realistic manner. This film is sheer entertainment constructed in the most gleeful manner. Peak filmmaking.",

It's fair to say that, along the way, they meet plenty of people who want to put a damper on their plans (or simply just murder them horribly).As I mentioned, there's an all star cast, so expect one great performance after the other.

            "content": "True Romance (1993) *** (out of 4) High-energy romp written by Quentin Tarantino that all you need to know if that Dennis Hopper of all people plays the most normal character. Clarence (Christian Slater) marries Alabama (Patricia Arquette) after knowing each other one day and when he goes to her pimp (Gary Oldman) to get her things he ends up killing the pimp and running off with half a million in cocaine. Soon the new couple are on their way to California to try and sale it but gangsters are hot on their trail. TRUE ROMANCE, at its heart, is a love story between the couple but with Tarantino's name attached you know it's not going to be your typical romance. Instead we get a foul-mouthed, non-stop violent and at times insane action picture that starts off weird and just keeps getting nuttier as the film goes along. As I said, you know you're in for a wild time when you've got Dennis Hopper playing the most normal person. It should also be mentioned that the mad man Hopper gets a terrific scene with Christopher Walken, which is worth the price of admission. I mean, the two craziest guys of their era in a scene together? Tarantino's screenplay is full of everything people have come to love about him including the references to older movies and the dialogue itself is just so sharp and fresh that you'll have no problem connecting to these characters even when the majority of viewers would never have come into contact with their type in real life. The all-star cast is another major plus with Slater and Arquette doing a terrific job together and they really come off as a wild and crazy couple. The terrific supporting cast includes the already mentioned Hopper and Walken but there's also Val Kilmer playing Elvis, a mentor to Slater plus Brad Pitt as a pothead, Bronson Pinchot, Samuel L. Jackson, Michael Rapaport, Saul Rubinek and James Gandolfini as one of the goons. The violence in the film is pretty brutal from start to finish with the pimp really getting a workout and the ending, which features the good guys doing battle with not only drug dealers but also gangsters and the police. The incredibly violent shoot out is so unrealistic but it's so stylishly done that you have no problem turning off your brain and enjoying. Some of the violence goes a tad bit too far and especially a sequence where Arquette gets her entire body broken to a pulp. There are a few minor issues with the story including how this comic book nerd could turn into a mad man over night plus the fact that it seems like the police are always missing no matter how crazy everything in the story gets. With that said, TRUE ROMANCE isn't a masterpiece but it's still a very entertaining little gem that contains enough energy for two movies and the solid cast really makes it a must see.",

Christian Slater (the once-promising young Jack Nicholson) carries the load admirably, and Patricia Arquette is sexier than ever.

Not in this lifetime anyhow. Admittedly this was his first movie script, which he drew from his own experiences down at Video Archives. The title here is a killer, where much more is happening than just romance. The names and characters which aren't just drawn from a hat, are loud and interesting, and I'm even talking about the baddies, such as pimp, Drexl Spivey, played with such evil and loathing from the ever versatile Gary Oldman. His demise is one of the most shockingly violent moments in Tarantino history, as was the scene with cutie pie Alabama Whitman (a perfectly splendid Arquette) enduring a hell of a bashing by mobster, Virgil (the late great Gandofini) in that motel suite, one of the strongest cinematic moments, I've craved revenge. When seeing it back in 94, two women behind me went off at that scene violence. Remember you've walked into a film penned by Tarantino, where like Dogs, generated the same kind of violence. He's set a new standard. Believe it or not too, both these films are more violent than Pulp Fiction. The violence here is nasty, and bites. As a follow up to Dogs, Tarantino couldn't cut it more perfect, where as Tarantino films, there's a lot of similarities. As you know he retains some of the same names, surnames, dialogue quotes, and insignificant close up shots of coffee cups and ten minute commentary on things like songs, franchises, and how restaurants hardly get held up. The dialogue springs to life from the very go, as Slater plays an unbalanced Elvis idol, junk food eating, comic reading, trigger finger loner, Clarence Worley and he does it, in one of his best ever performances, where it's still up there, in spite of every other movie he's done. He's set up on a blind date with Alabama, an prostitute new to the game, who accidentally falls in love, creating a manifold of mayhem, when Clarence tries to square things with Drexl, where things of course, don't go as planned. When retrieving Alabama's case from the very dead Drexl, he takes the wrong one. It's full of Coke. So, Clarence and Alabama take off to L.A, to sell it with a contact friend of his, the mobsters and that in tow. Hopper's performance, as Worley's gentle cop father, was a nice change of fine role, where of course I loved Walken as the main mobster baddie, who doesn't take kindly to racial insults. The Q and A caravan torture scene was one of the best scenes in the flick. And the shootout in the motel room near the end, again as a similarity, all so reminded me of the Mexican standoff in Dogs. But this guys got style and knows how to make movies exciting, and this two hour pic is a perfect example of that. I was more for these films, than his later ones, which gets MA ratings instead of R's. True Romance is one of his most explosively violent films ever, and like I said earlier it bites.",

He works in a comic book store, is obsessed with Elvis Presley (he even talks to his ghost, whom of which is played by Val Kilmer), and has a thing for Kung-Fu films.  Things take a turn for the better when Alabama (Patricia Arquette) walks into his life.  They automatically fall in love and just days after they first meet, they decide to get married.  Alabama, however, has a confession to make: She is a call girl and is determined to leave behind her old life in order to make a fresh start with Clarence.  Even with all of this behind them now, Clarence still has something eating away deep inside him.  It seems that he can't stand the fact that Alabama's former pimp, Drexl (Gary Oldman), who is also a white wannabe homeboy, is breathing the same air as he is.  So Clarence decides to pay Drexl a visit.  Drexl is not exactly anxious to let go of Alabama and so a shootout ensues which leaves Drexl dead and Clarence with a suitcase full of cocaine.  Clarence walks away from the situation as a hero in the eyes of Alabama, but from this you can also conclude that he is very stupid, yet courageous.  After the confrontation, Clarence hatches a brilliant scheme to go on a cross-country road trip to Los Angeles to sell the cocaine to a rich movie producer named Lee Donowitz (Saul Rubinek) and with the money, they can go anywhere in the world that they want.  So Clarence reunites with his childhood buddy, Dick Ritchie (Michael Rapaport) and his slob of a roommate, Floyd (a very stoned Brad Pitt).  Dick has setup a meeting with Lee through his connection with Elliot Blitzer (Bronson Pinchot) who is Lee's assistant. Clarence's plan seems perfect, except that what he doesn't know is, the cocaine that he stole actually belongs to a group of very p****d off mobsters who have come looking for it. \"True Romance\" is now my all time favorite movie.  The performances are excellent and with an all-star cast such as this one, how could it not be? Christian Slater and Patricia Arquette make a very good couple and you cannot help but praise their efforts for what they have to go through to start a new life with each other.  Dennis Hopper and Christopher Walken have one great (and very offensive) scene together.  Gary Oldman is totally off the wall as the wannabe homeboy, Drexl.  Although he is only in two scenes, he does make a lasting impression.  His first scene, which is during a drug buy with Big Don (Samuel L. Jackson), is amongst some of the best parts of the movie.  I cannot find a single fault with this movie.  I have noticed that Quentin Tarantino has not received a lot of credit for this movie.  That is most likely due to the fact that he did not direct this movie; that credit goes to Tony \"Top Gun\" Scott.  Of course, since Tarantino DID write this movie, you can expect the following: witty dialogue, unbelievable characters, lots of dark humor, and at least two or more scenes of unsettlingly, brutal violence.  To those who do not know what I am talking about, watch Patricia Arquette's encounter with James Gandolfini in the hotel room or watch the ever-famous \"Mexican Standoff\" at the end. 10/10",

            "content": "Nothing in True Romance is especially mature, but that doesn't stop it from being quite the little blast of cine-literate pulp nonsense. Some of it's funny, some of it's actually quite disturbing; most of it has a lot to do with drugs and pimps, and lowlifes killing other lowlifes to an omnipresent rock-'em-sock-'em aesthetic; it's put together in this manner that has it creep along the line of what's acceptable and what isn't, but it works in the long run if for the time you're sitting there watching it. To state that it's one of the best films a certain Tony Scott ever made speaks volumes; to say the likes of those such as Brad Pitt went on to play roles much more interesting in films that were a lot better speaks even greater volumes. Most of the film is good value; very little of it is especially grown-up; it's tone and content, which will sway wildly from stoner comedy to one of the two leads receiving a beating from a mobster in a nasty little scene, just about holds together with this dumb, infectious energy constantly ticking it over in the engine room.Christian Slater plays Clarence Worley, a store clerk in his twenties; a sensitive and kind, although schizophrenic, man who craves a female presence in his life and talks with great enthusiasm about things that are dear to him, namely comic books; Elvis Presley tracks and import kung-fu films of the 1970s. When I think of a \"Clarence\", I think of a deliberately dorky looking character in a Gary Larson sketch. He sits at a bar, during the opening scene, and talks to a sex worker about these things, but he's out of his depth - as if he's too nice-a guy to be in this zone speaking to this calibre of person, but so starved of anything remotely of Clarence's ilk is the zone within which he's based, that he must resort to such places and people. She is disinterested, but then again of course she is.Cut to an establishing shot of where we are: a grim looking Detroit with a grey cloud over it and a generally gloomy atmosphere. Fate appears to deliver an amiable blow when another young sex worker, Patricia Arquette's Alabama, enters the cinema within which Clarence is watching a kung-fu film and sits next to him. They bond, appear to get along and before True Romance's second act can even stretch its legs in preparation to enter the fray, they are married. Clarence is happy he's quashed his desire for someone female and with the apparent interest in what he likes and Alabama's search for some sort of consistency in this, her trek up from far and away Florida, has led her to young Clarence.Where Slater's character lived for the adventure in his movies, and could only feel passion and love for certain comic books in that he's very protective of certain rare varieties of them, he is now able to direct unto Alabama this enthusiasm to keep something that needs protecting as pristine as possible as well as experience the adventure and dangers abound in his films and comic books. This is born out of what lies within the threatening circles within which Alabama operated prior to knowing Clarence: specifically, her pimp Drexl (Oldman) and the fact he takes issue with this newly formed matrimony. The point of no return is crossed; this first barrier the \"new\" Clarence must hurdle if he is to live out his fantasies and maintain what it is he's found after years of searching accomplished in his killing of Drexl. Once carried out, the pair of them head for Los Angeles out of the fact somewhat skewered twist of fate that saw Clarence grab a case of cocaine upon leaving Drexl's abode, with the mobsters (the true owners of the drugs) out looking for it too.It's no secret the film loses a lot of its energy and verve upon its arrival in California; primarily out of the fact they get there too quickly and the early poking around under this cloud of gloom and apparent despair as a young guy and a young girl fall in love and try to work around this psychotic pimp is quite good. I've never been fond of crime films set in sunny, bright nor indeed welcoming locales, but what's lacking here is much for Clarence and Alabama to actually get up to. We do not, to the film's ultimate detriment, have the leads' journey to L.A. depicted; a passage of time rife with the potential for dramatic ingredients and the opportunity for a stone-wall antagonist to establish themselves so that it might provide these two leads something to do. There is the potential for this sort of material, in that Christopher Walken plays the boss of a group of these mobsters looking for their cocaine, whose verbal standoff with Clarence's father as he strives to find where they've gone calls to mind the best of what True Romance writer Tarantino can do: think the opening scene of Inglourious Basterds or the final scenes of Pulp Fiction. Alas, he disappears after this one sequence. Credit must go to Christian Slater, who does well in his depiction of someone going from being this weak clerk to a hardened guy having to punch well above his weight, but the film lacks any sort of backbone. Its persistency to use Malick's overture from Badlands serves only to remind us how good that film was, whereas with hindsight, one is able to point out how Tarantino forged an early forte out of depicting partnerships, or couples, dodging bullets and doing crime as apparent in Natural Born Killers; From Dusk 'til Dawn or strands of Pulp Fiction. This is the lesser of the four, and not particularly brilliant as a standalone film either.",

            "content": "\"If you gave me a million years to ponder, I would never have guessed that true romance and Detroit would ever go together.\"I would never have guessed that Tony Scott and Quentin Tarantino would ever go together, but what a pleasant surprise this romantic crime thriller turned out to be. Thanks to a sharp and witty script and entertaining characters True Romance was extremely cool. The best way I can describe this film is to take Patricia Arquette's character's words and sound like a broken record: all I could think of while watching this film was Quentin Tarantino you are so cool; Tony Scott you are so cool; every single actor in this film you are so cool, True Romance you are so cool. I can't believe I had to wait 21 years to get around to watching this considering how big of a Quentin Tarantino fan I am (and I'm also a huge fan of Tony Scott's work in Man on Fire). Tarantino's energetic script and Scott's stylized direction blended perfectly in this near masterpiece. The cast is absolutely brilliant here and there are so many memorable characters and scenes in this film. I think I enjoyed this film more watching it for the first time now than if I would have seen it in 1993 considering there are so many familiar faces that I probably wouldn't have recognized back then. Brad Pitt, Val Kilmer, Dennis Hopper, Gary Oldman, Christopher Walken, Samuel L. Jackson, James Gandolfini, and Chris Penn all have small but memorable roles. Oldman is barely recognizable playing a pimp with dreadlocks and a glass eye, but it is a unique performance. Christian Slater and Patricia Arquette give the performance of their careers here; it's a shame Slater has been in so many terrible films in the past decade because his performance here was promising. Arquette is adorable as Alabama and I can't think of another sweeter performance than hers. There is so much energy and charm in this film that it's hard to resist. Like good wine, True Romance will probably age better over time considering I couldn't believe how much fun I was having watching an early 90's film for the first time. True Romance you are so cool!Clarence Worley (Christian Slater) is a comic book store clerk who also happens to be a martial arts film buff. He plans to spend his birthday as he always does, at the movies, watching a triple feature of Sonny Chiba. What he doesn't expect is that he will find the love of his life there. While he is watching the film, a pretty woman walks into the theater spilling her popcorn all over him. She apologizes and introduces herself as Alabama (Patricia Arquette). The two fall in love with each other after she opens up to him about her true identity. This leads them through a series of dangerous adventures involving pimps (Gary Oldman), the Sicilian mafia (Christopher Walken, James Gandolfini), drug dealers (Samuel L. Jackson), police officials (Chris Penn, Tom Sizemore), and Hollywood producers (Saul Rubinek, Bronson Pinchot). The film is full of energy and thrills as the two lovers face several obstacles along the way. Thankfully, Clarence seems to have a mentor on his side to guide him: an apparition of his idol Elvis Presley (Val Kilmer) who is sort of his conscious.Even if you aren't a huge fan of Tarantino you could still enjoy True Romance for all the beloved actors in this film that weren't probably big Hollywood names back then. The film moves so quickly and the script is so energetic that It makes for a very entertaining watch. There are so many memorable scenes in this film, like the face off between Gary Oldman and Christian Slater, the group Mexican standoff, and the violent hotel scene involving Gandolfini and Arquette, but the real scene stealer would have to be the one in which Dennis Hopper, who plays Clarence's father, is ambushed by Christopher Walken and his gang and they have a not so friendly chat about Sicilians. It was a pure Tarantino moment and there are a lot of these great dialogues that allow for the film to have such a great pace and move along so nicely. The style and characters in this film make it such a unique experience and film lovers will enjoy the Hollywood satire as well. I am so glad I finally got to see this wild and romantic film. This is another reason why Tony Scott will be missed.",

The cast collected for this film was awesome. Samuel L. Jackson in a very small part, almost a cameo. Dennis Hopper was tremendous in his last scene, as was Christopher Walken. Even James Gandolfini, who would have been relatively unknown then, put in a very good turn. Much of the rest of the supporting cast was also excellent, with the possible exception of Gary Oldman, who went just a little far over the top. Now, Christain Slater is a pretty good actor, and I've enjoyed some of his stuff. For that matter I enjoyed this one. But with these giants in the cast, Slater fairly obviously comes up short. And mention must be made of Patricia Arquette, who more or less stole the show. Her portrayal of Alabama's defiance in the scene with Gandolfini should be a cinematic classic. If you can stand the violence and profanity, I recommend checking this one out.",

            "content": "As much as I love Quentin Tarantino (well...love his movies), he does get pretty pretentious at times. One prime example was Kill Bill: Volume Two, where he thinks his dialogue is so good that he forgets that it's only good dialogue in a Tarantino fashion if it's funny, also. The same thing happened to True Romance. Often, Tarantino's writing is memorable, making his movies memorable and immortal. Although I'm behind on reviews, so I saw this movie a few weeks ago, I remember almost nothing from this film. There are some speeches characters give that could go down next to the \"Royale with Cheese\" sequence from Pulp Fiction, but, alas, they don't for a variety of reasons.Clarence (Christian Slater) is a typical loser. His boss hires prostitute Alabama (Patricia Arquette) to have sex with him on his birthday, and before they know it, they're married. Clarence kills her pimp (Gary Oldman), steals cocaine from him, and goes to Hollywood looking to sell it. The pimp's men go out to chase them. What an exciting story.I'm not going to blame it all on Tarantino. Much of the problem should be directed to director Tony Scott. You may remember him as being the one who took a possibility for a great movie called Man on Fire, chewed it up, spit it back out, and turned it into total crap. He shows more restraint here, making True Romance bearable and, at times, exciting. But nothing in it is memorable-the shootoff in Reservoir Dogs (which wasn't memorable per se) was more memorable. The characters weren't memorable, the scenes and speeches weren't memorable, and most of the movie wasn't memorable. I'm getting ahead of myself. I'm making True Romance out to be this awful movie. It really isn't.Some of the movie was interesting (for then), and there's a great scene between Dennis Hopper and Christopher Walken. It doesn't resonate with me now, but as I was watching the movie, I was thinking how cool it was. While the characters weren't really defined much, they were acted well throughout. Samuel L. Jackson could have done more, though. Then again, Sam Jackson eating cottage cheese is exciting for me. But I digress. True Romance is nowhere near the potential Tarantino has, but if you watch it, you'll probably enjoy it. But don't think about it afterwards or you'll not like it as much.My rating: 6/10Rated R for violence, language, and drug use.",

I know you know where they are, so tell me before I do some damage you won't walk away from.\" The above dialogue is said by Christopher Walken (Vincenzo Coccotti) in what , in my opinion is one of the greatest scenes in modern cinema.The verbal sparring between Walken and Hopper is one of the reasons why i love movies so much, so thanks guys! It's been far too long since i watched this film , 15 years to be precise , and thanks to a little bit of self indulgence i have re equanted myself with the film that is \"True Romance\". Clarence Worley is a well-meaning but socially unskilled comic-shop clerk whose idea of a big night out is catching a Sonny Chiba triple-feature at a downtown grindhouse. Clarence is celebrating his birthday in just such a manner when he meets a beautiful girl named Alabama , and it's love at first sight for both of them. Clarence's enthusiasm isn't dampened much when he discovers Alabama is actually a prostitute who was paid by his boss to bump into him; she's only been in the business for a few days, and is more than eager to give up streetwalking to be with Clarence. However, Alabama is certain her pimp, Drexl ,will not be happy; he's an ill-mannered sort with mob connections and a fondness for violence.Chivalrous Clarence offers to break the news to Drexl and collect her belongings, but he doesn't tell her he also plans to kill Drexl while he's there; a melee breaks out that leaves Drexl and his henchmen dead. Clarence grabs a suitcase that he thinks contains Alabama's clothes, but he discovers it instead holds five million dollars' worth of cocaine. The couple hits the road for California, planning to sell the dope and enjoy the good life in South America with the proceeds, but soon a group of very unhappy underworld characters are after them, as well as the police. It's a rare thing that a group of actors are on top of their game , all at the same time in the same film but when it does happen , you get a film like True Romance. In my opinion Christian Slater and Patricia Arquette are perfect in roles as Clarence and Alabama . Slater oozes charm and Arquette could make any man fall on love with her . I think that these two actors put in the best performances of their careers. ( i cant think of anything they have done since that is as good.) .Christopher Walken makes the best ten minute cameo in a film i can think off. he's funny , yet menacing , which in turn has a knock on affect with Dennis Hopper. An actor i don't normally rate that highly , yet in the scenes with Walken he is amazing. There are other good performance from Brad Pitt , Gary Oldman and what looks like a young Tony Soprano from James Gandolfini. Having given all this praise i still think True Romance is far from being perfect. Quentin Tarantino's script is not a polished as we see in later films such as Reservoir Dogs and Pulp Fiction, yet it's undeniably Tarantino . Also i was a little disappointed with the final five minutes of the film especially after THAT monumental shoot up. It's all a bit too \"happy ever after\" for my liking. Never the less this is a classic movie and has a special place in my movie watching heart. 9 out of 10",

Everything Tarantino touched pre-1997 was fresh and new and entertaining, and back then he was only filling his films with references to his favourite movies instead of ripping them off under the guise of paying homage. Here, the film fairly bulges with these references, from movies playing on TVs in the background to posters on toilet walls to the wallpaper in the runaway couples' motel room and the Badlands-style voice-over and music. The dialogue isn't as hip as it would be in Dogs and Fiction, but it's still good and there are some stand-out scenes \u0096 two of which involve interrogations in which the person being interrogated turns the tables on their persecutor in different but equally effective ways.The other thing that should be touched upon is the quality of the cast.

However, the problem is what is so great about the movie? Direction? Sorry, but we are not talking about Enemy of the State here. Acting? I don't think so, no Oscar worthy performance here. The cinematography? Nothing special. Story? A guy and a girl meet and get troubled. That's the story. This is not a great road movie or lovers on the run movie, there is nothing impressive or even artistic like Quentin Tarantino movies itself. There is not any remarkable scene to mention with enthusiasm. I don't know this adulation is because Tarantino wrote the script or not, but this is the case. It was like one of the TV movies with a dreamy cast. Years years before I bought it from a newsstand, because saw the list of the cast on the cover and saw Tony Scott. However, not only it was only a huge disappointment, but also I did not enjoy at all. Some people say look! they watch a fighting movie in the film, a reference for martial art movies. That's funny, because I love martial art movies and I would prefer to watch any martial art movie instead of watching this again. True Romance has a dreamy cast probably you will never see once again in another movie. I could not pull myself together for a long time, after had seen the cast as mentioned, but it does not save the day. By the way, honestly, I couldn't see some of them, for example I couldn't see Brad Pitt against my full attention. Thus, this is not a 'cast driven' movie at all. Tony Scott's style (I mean Tony Scott in his early days like Top Gun or Enemy of the State) is missing in this movie. True Romance is not a stylish movie, it is just ordinary in terms of direction. And as I see, especially critics don't like Top Gun, but love True Romance. True Romance recalls One Night at McCool's in the final part. That part was a little bit sloppy, but at least entertaining. Tony Scott shot such a scene? Hard to believe. Later, I exchanged the movie with another one after watching.

Their loyalty towards one another really drives the film forward and makes the audiences love towards the characters a lot stronger. You get to know the characters as well as they know each other because of their short time together, which makes you cheer on their romance even more. However, that's just a small part of the movie (I'm not a huge fan of pure romance movies). From beginning to end, the movie grips you and takes you on a rollercoaster of different emotions; as you smile at how cute Alabama is and laugh whenever she laughs, and fill with anger when she is being thrown around the hotel room, beaming at her persistence to succeed. Or when you cling onto everything Clarence says, hoping that he comes out the other side alive even though you watched the movie a million times before. This movie is a new experience every time you watch it and overall, this movie just makes me really happy and that is probably the main reason why I love it so much.\nIt's not just the two main cast members that make this movie. The smaller parts bring just as much importance into the film. Brad Pitt's small role as pothead, Floyd, brings a comedic break into the movie. As well as Gary Oldman and Christopher Walken's roles as the fictitious villains, Drexel and Vincenzo, giving the lead characters something to fear and adding more excitement to the script. And let's not forget that famous fight scene between Alabama and Virgil. I love that scene!\nOriginally written by Quentin Tarantino, Tony Scott read his script and wanted to direct it. This being one of Tarantino's first movies, Scott approached him and that he could make him huge, if he let him direct this movie. He agreed. Tarantino said Scott \"glossed up my script, made it too pretty, too vivid. That's what makes it work so well, and the casting and performances he got.\" It is unclear whether Tarantino loved what he did with the movie, but I think that whatever he changed from the original script, worked!\nLinking to the poster. I think it stays very true to the movie itself. It doesn't give much away and merely shows the two main characters with Clarence holding a gun. However, just by looking at the poster it shows straight away how much Alabama means to Clarence at his persistence to keep her safe. And I think Alabama's smile in the first poster against Clarence's serious expression shows the whole reason why this movie is a masterpiece.",

Yes, there is a lot of violence but the violence is set up with such emotion that it is difficult to not feel complete understanding with the characters as to why they did what they did and how they did it. The scene with Patricia Arquette and James Gandolfini is quite emotional as well. This scene catapulted Gandolfini into the go to guy if you wanted a believable old school mafioso in your film and most likely helped him get his award winning role as the head of the Soprano family. I guarantee, if you love a violent well written underdog story you will love this film. The tension filled final scene will leave you breathless and wanting more but in the greatest way possible. Thank you Quentin for such an amazing script and thank you Tony Scott for doing what you do best!",

            "content": "\"let's re-watch True Romance\"...that's how I ended my IMDb comment of Quentin Tarantino's first, if never officially released and incomplete, film My Best Friend's Birthday. I remember finding True Romance on R4 DVD about two years ago under the title of \"La Fuga\", that means something like \"The Escape\"(I remember being surprised after finding the R4 DVD, being like \"damn, how I was going to find it! That's why we don't f****** learn English!\"), and I saw it immediately. After seeing, finally, My Best Friend's Birthday (the basis of the script of True Romance) I had desires to watch for the second time this film (pretty much back in 2007 I liked it but not really as much as any other film that I would like to watch more than once) and I finally did so last night. I think I liked it a bit more than the first time. Christian Slater is Tarantino, I mean he is Clarence and he has the same name and some same dialogs of Tarantino's character in \"Birthday\" yet here Clarence is the one of the birthday (and his last name ain't Pool), then the one who is going to receive something that tastes like a peach from his best friend, or better said from his boss since apparently he has no friends. Clarence is a guy who will f*** all of his possibilities to make out with a nice chick by inviting her to a Kung Fu night at the cinema (\"you wanna take me to a Kung Fu movie?\", asks the probable date of our hero and he f****** gains us more yet and certainly not her once he responds to her question, he goes like: \"three Kung Fu movies\"), and who will be in his birthday, just like every year, having a good time at the cinema (fortunately the DVD of The Street Fighter is there on my shelf just waiting!) but then it happens, a dream comes true, it's paid but nevertheless it's a dream come true! Patricia Arquette for your birthday! And the dream goes on and on: true romance, wedding, love tattoo, Elvis but also lots of violence, the clerk of a comic book store is now a pimp f***** (you gotta love Gary Oldman in this one!), what love makes...Anyway, for me with True Romance we don't have a film that has some parts that really stands out as the better ones. Is not like once they, Clarence and his wife, Patricia Arquette's character, Alabama, arrive to Los Angeles (that is like the second part of the film) the film is better or worse. Is more like, we have good and not so good moments during the whole film. Some of the performances are not quite convincing and some scenes should have been better (for instance the final confrontation between practically everybody at a hotel room could have been much more exciting and tense). Going back to the performances, well as you know we have a cast full of stars: from Dennis Hooper to Brad Pitt passing through Samuel L. Jackson and Christopher Walken (and for the TV fans we have Tony Soprano, as a mafioso that will make us see another side of the peach Alabama, and Berta from Two and a Half Men. Oh and for us The Wire fans there's Paul Ben-Victor, aka: Spiros Vondas, also as a mafioso). Seeing the film in 2009 is of course seeing a film full of real Hollywood stars yet is not seeing a film full of truly great acting. All of them are okay and most of them have at least a memorable bit. Christopher Walken and Dennis Hopper stands out for the part in which we confirm two things and both Brad Pitt (minor role but very funny and quite relevant even though he never goes out of his place) and Gary Oldman delivers a lot of fun... the rest, well like I said they all are okay (it's nice having Elvis, by the way).And just like its performances for me True Romance is not a truly brilliant masterpiece (or a film I would like to watch again and again) but a fun ride nevertheless.",

            "content": "This is an entertaining crime-flick made from a Tarantino script. It isn't as good as Reservoir Dogs or Pulp Fiction; in fact, it isn't nearly as good as those but it is a good film none-the-less.This movie contains all of the usual Tarantino style dialogue \u0096 pop cultural references, un-PC stuff, funny one-liners, etc. And it has to be said, it is one of True Romance's strong-points. That and the acting; this film really does have a very good cast. There are excellent turns by Gary Oldman, Dennis Hopper, Christopher Walken, Chris Penn, Bronson Pinchot, Brad Pitt and Saul Rubinek. Every one of these actors really makes the most of their screen time. Unfortunately, the same cannot be said of the two central players. Christian Slater is unconvincing, although his character isn't exactly the most convincing Tarantino creation \u0096 a comic book assistant who instantly turns into a gun-toting, unhinged madman? Come on now! And Patricia Arquette, despite being incredibly sexy, comes across as just a little too gigglingly moronic most of the time. Generally speaking, the romance aspect of this film was really trite and unengaging. These weren't great characters to hang the story onto to be perfectly honest.But all of that aside, the rest of the film is very impressive both in terms of tension and writing. The Gary Oldman scene is terrifying. The Walken/Hopper confrontation is an acting master class. And Bronson Pinchot, in particular is absolutely hilarious as Elliot the cowardly actor \u0096 I particularly enjoyed the scene where he is pulled over for erratic driving \u0096 priceless! Despite the unappealing central characters, True Romance is a film that is well worth seeking out.",

            "content": "Don't be misled by the title. It's true that the central couple -- Christian Slater and Patricia Arquette -- are in love. There's never any doubt about it, though, so we don't have too many domestic disputes, no anguish over whether the two will find spiritual fulfillment in one another, no tearful complaints from the wife that the husband is married to his career, nothing cute at all, as a matter of fact. Adequate support is provided by Bronson Pinchot and a couple of others, including several one-day walk ons by figures you'll recognize at once.In possession of half a million bucks worth of cocaine, which they are willing to part with for half that amount, just to avoid the hassle of cutting it and selling it, Slater and Arquette take off for Hollywoodland where, as everyone knows, the cocaine is as ubiquitous as the car exhaust. The mob, however, does not approve of Slater's absconding with their \"cola\" and are in pursuit, at the end of which they (and the cops too) catch up with the couple during a deal with a Hollywood mogul surrounded by well-armed gentlemen. The Hollywood goons shoot at the mob, the mob shoots at the goons, and the police shoot at everybody. The air is filled with feathers from exploded pillows as Arquette and the wounded Slater sneak out and head for Mexico.It's funny, but it's a pretty gory movie too. James Gandolfini shows up at Arquette's apartment and demands to know where the coke is. Arquette can't stop giggling as she tells him that there's a Coke machine at the end of the hall. She giggles through howls of pain even as he beats her to a pulp and throws her through walls. She winds up a bloody mess. It would be nice if professional make up personnel would remember that blood in the open coagulates and turns dark after half an hour. Here, as elsewhere, it's vermilion throughout.Despite the tumult, it's amusing. At times the dialog reaches for the keen. Maybe the funniest role is Brad Pitt's, as a stoned roommate of one of the lesser figures. Faced with a shotgun, he decides it would be better to withdraw his offer of a hit from his bong.",

Quentin Tarantino, who is the official writer of this film, and Tony Scott, who has officially directed this film, were on one trip while making this flick! 'True Romance' is about a newly married couple who screw up big time and get involved with the very wrong guys. The film begins very well, the first 30-40 minutes are interesting and absorbing. But! As soon as the film shows it's real colors, it falls on it's face. Also, the goings-on get too violent and gory, which puts you off completely. More over, the culmination is also a downer. The impact clearly seems missing! Quentin Tarantino is my favorite filmmaker, I am a huge fan of his. But, I have no option here, but to say this popular faze: When The Mighty Fell! Same goes for Tony Scott.In the acting department, 'True Romance' gets an ensemble cast, and there are some note-worthy performances. Christian Slater is excellent. Patricia Arquette looks each bit of the character and performs well. Michael Rapaport hams. Christopher Walken & Gary Oldman prove their caliber, yet again. James Gandolfini is fantastic. Late Dennis Hopper is first-rate. Brad Pitt is royally sidelined, and same goes for Val Kilmer.On the whole, 'True Romance' is a major letdown.",

            "content": "There is simply no denying the terrific platform given to an ensemble cast of gritty character-actors, but the problem with Quentin Tarantino's Tony Scott directed TRUE ROMANCE are the two leads... Christian Slater's Clarence Worley and his gift-turned-girlfriend Alabama, played by Patricia Arquette, lack both chemistry and experience, seeming more like friends of the apartment-dwelling briefcase guys massacred by the following year's PULP FICTION killers Jules and Vincent than anyone those particular assassins would spend time conversing with, or admiring. Slater spouts pop culture diatribes - ranging from Max Julien to Carol Speed to Richard Pryor (THE MACK cast) to Sonny Chiba to Spider Man - like he's just learned how while Arquette's voice grates on the nerves, and beyond.The plot is simple enough: After what was supposed to be a one night stand, Clarence falls so hard for Alabama that he decides to get rid of the person who makes her what she is, or what she used to be, a whore... And they eventually wind up with a ton of cocaine as mobsters and cops dog their heels. Backing up to an important scene, straight out of Woody Allen's PLAY IT AGAIN SAM replacing Elvis with Bogart: Clarence, a hardcore Presley fanatic, has a hallucinatory conversation with The King (Val Kilmer), who suggests he follow through on a particularly violent urge...Though you'd think Elvis gave Clarence more than advice. Maybe a superhero pill since the transition from kung fu cinema fan/comic book seller to ultra violent pimp killer is so quick and unsupported, during the rest of the movie - where real adults take part in some intense interactions - our lovestruck Bonnie and Clyde seem like passengers in what's supposed to be their very own ride.For cinema history's sake, TRUE ROMANCE was the script Tarantino sold to give him the last-minute power to replace Monte Hellman as the RESERVOIR DOGS director. And on paper, ROMANCE is extremely unique and, most importantly, non-linear, an uncommon style before PULP FICTION paved the way. So the mainstream Tony Scott put the story in order, threw in a glossy Aerosmith track, shoots Clarence and Alabama's initial love scene like a steamy TOP GUN sex scene, and provides his usual choppy closeups resembling inserts in a grainy music video.Not that TRUE ROMANCE doesn't have value: The famous Dennis Hopper to Christopher Walken \"Am I Lying?\" monologue is good (for two characters we hardly know as the writing trumps the acting) and there's a handful of fitfully edgy moments set within a sparse Neo Noir backdrop and yet, strangely enough, at times the retro-soaked Tarantino dialogue, not spoken on his own stage, feels more of a neurotic intrusion within Scott's gritty template than the engine of a potential hot rod that, even after twenty long years, just can't shed that new car smell.",

As is, the film just didn't interest me all that much, and I only really paid attention to the first few and the last few scenes. The plot never really got my interest, though I thought the love story between the two leads was surprisingly good. The pacing seems much too slow and jolted for a Tarantino film(honestly, either Tarantino should have been allowed to direct it or Scott should have written his own script). The acting ranges, but most of it is good. Slater is acceptable, but a good actor he is not. His performance is passable at best, and him being the leading man definitely took a lot out of the experience for me. The film never really seemed to take off or go anywhere... and not long into the movie, it was just waiting for the next guy to get killed. The dialog is typical Tarantino, meaning somewhat roundabout, but usually funny and/or insightful. The humor is pretty good, and also fairly typical Tarantino(though it too would have benefited from Tarantino directing the film). To make it perfectly clear; the film is clearly and obviously and in many, many ways a Tarantino film. His unique and easily recognizable style is here, just like in Reservoir Dogs, both volumes of Kill Bill, Pulp Fiction and Jackie Brown. However, this is, by definition, not a Tarantino film. He didn't direct it, and believe me, it shows. Scott just doesn't \"get\" Tarantino's style, and messes up so many of his trademarks(most notably, he removes the important non-linear time-line) and references, stuff that Tarantino never would have blown, not in a million years(here I feel it is necessary to point out that I am not a fan of Tarantino's). Yes, that's what really brings this film down; another director trying to shoot a story that Tarantino has put together, and who completely misses the boat. Just for the record, an example of a director's perfect use of a Tarantino script is the Robert Rodriguez/Quentin Tarantino collaboration From Dusk Till Dawn. Go see that one before even thinking about this one. I recommend this film to Tarantino/pulp fans. Give it a chance. Just don't expect a Tarantino film. 7/10",

            "content": "\"True Romance\" blossoms on a lot of levels, but it most distinctively bears the mark of an early Quentin Tarantino film. The scene dynamics and the way it plays beautifully in and out of turning points are all early signs of the would-be master at work. Released the year between \"Resevoir Dogs\" and \"Pulp Fiction,\" \"True Romance\" doesn't carry his directorial signature, but it reeks of Tarantino in all the right ways and compares favorably with those two early '90s crime thrillers.The replay value of \"True Romance\" dwells in how its bounty of supporting actors all went on to outdo its two stars. Christian Slater and Patricia Arquette play Clarence and Alabama, a couple who meet because Alabama was a call girl hired to sleep with Clarence as a birthday present. They fall in love and marry instantly. To put the past behind them, Clarence visits her pimp (Gary Oldman -- that's awesome supporting role number one), kills him and makes off with a half million in coke.Hunting the runaway couple are agents of a mob boss played in one 100 percent Tarantino scene by Christopher Walken and later by James Gandolfini in a breakout performance. Brad Pitt, who worked with director Tony Scott's brother Ridley as an unknown just two years before in another fugitive film, \"Thelma & Louise,\" plays the unassuming stoner roommate of Clarence's best friend (played by comedian Michael Rapaport). Other notables are brief appearances from Samuel L. Jackson and Val Kilmer, as well as Dennis Hopper's as Clarence's father.Even with this \"secret\" knowledge, this dynamic works for this story, one that attempts to broaden one's definition of love to include murder, running from the law and flat out acting nuts. Clarence and Alabama are unconventional and completely stupid, deserving of losing everything, but in front of a backdrop of characters who define true moral scumminess, it becomes easy to root for them.Scott certainly helped create the suspense necessary for a dialog-heavy Tarantino script and that warrants applause, but Quentin simply owns this picture at its core. Hopper's \"history lesson\" where he laughs in Walken's face as he refers to his ancestors as a racial epithet showcase Tarantino's classic tension-twisting. The way a scene's momentum shifts at the drop of a hat and climaxes into pure mayhem captures his utter brilliance. The characters spanning a wide array of vivid strangeness and the sheer untamable wildness of the story and events make \"True Romance\" hard to forget.~Steven CVisit my site at http://moviemusereviews.com",

Exciting, sexy, enjoyable crime thriller with great and great-looking stars is one of my favourite Tarantino scripts. Sparkling pop-culture dialogue, great characters, great scenes (check the one between Dennis Hopper and Christopher Walken, Gary Oldman's gem of a scene, Brad Pitt's just lying there on the couch, the classic movie theatre scene where Clarence and Alabama meet, followed by the just as classic diner scene).Has a great sense of humour - the pervasive joke is every reaction you think Alabama will have to the various stupid things Clarence does, she has the opposite. Violence is true romance - sick? Perhaps. Its the one thing Tony Scott and Tarantino agree on: unnecessary violence is not cheap exploitation, its entertainment. I personally think the shock effects Tarantino uses to structure his screenplays are quite gimmicky and undergraduate. Quality does not always mean sudden shifts of sex and violence. Surprise is not always good. I could have done without the hotel room scene, for example, where Alabama has a near-deadly encounter with a hit-man. One of the most violent things i've ever seen.Nevertheless, if you skip these scenes, its a compulsively enjoyable ride, and one of Tony Scott's least offensive films (Top Gun is sheer obnoxiousness today).8/10",

I picked to watch this film on Valentines Day because I'm single and didn't want something too mushy, and I must say that was the best movie decision I've made since as far as I can remember. True Romance is just that. Authentic. Genuine. Real. Terantino and director Tony Scott have intertwined romance and blood in a beautifully harmonious action thriller in which every character is distinctively defined. It didn't require one of the best movie endings I have ever witnessed to make me love this film, but it included it anyway. Bravo! 10/10",

            "content": "The plot is good, although it sometimes moves a little too close too the edge of believability. The characters are fun and very Tarantino, the cast does a great job fleshing them out even when they only have a small part. I also want to note the catchy and memorable score by Hans Zimmer that lends the film an upbeat and airy tone that fits the mentality of the two main characters and also sometimes forms a perfect contrast against the darker, more violent and bloody scenes. This early screenplay by Tarantino contains many of the fun \"tarantinoizms\" that make his movies so much fun!Overall Tony Scott has done a good job adapting the screenplay.One of my main problems with the film is that the final shootout Is a bit anticlimactic. The characters simply stand in a room and shoot at each other. This scene could have used some more suspense and style. Also the relationship between Clarence and Alabama was sometimes, like the plot of this movie, too close too the edge of believability.*Spoilers* I also want to make special note of the scene where Alabama is almost beaten to death by one of the mafiosi. It was very difficult to watch not only because of the emotionally intense and graphic violence, but also because this scene was excruciatingly long, with little \"funny\" scenes in between of Clarence driving to the hotel with not a care in the world, unknowing of the horror that is taking place in the hotel room.",

            "review_title": "The Amazing Story of a Bullet-Proof Love ...",
            "content": "There's one thing that \"True Romance\" doesn't lie about: its title. The romance is the core of the story and the soul of the movie from beginning to end. As soon as Clarence Whitman (Christian Slater), a comic-book vendor, fan of Elvis Presley and old Kung-Fu films -translation: a geek- meets Alabama Parker (Patricia Arquette), a hooker, we know and we feel that for each step one would make, the other would follow.What is extraordinary in Tony Scott's film is how it detaches itself from both action films where romances are usually reduced to cheesy subplots, and from romances since the two protagonists fall in love in a very surprising immediacy. No time for build-ups, for growing complicity, for love-and-hate wisecracks, \"True Romance\" echoes the classic loves-at-first-sight movies such as \"West Side Story\", \"Romeo and Juliet\" or any Disney film. It's a deliberate naivety enabling us to keep our hearts hooked to two endearing characters, trapped in a world of drugs and shotguns, where a bullet can hit you faster than love. The romance defines the couple's new life but also their new quest: living together in peace.And there's this dreamlike feeling conveyed by Hans Zimmer's score. The \"You're So Cool\" theme is so close to Gassenhauer's music it clearly indicates that the film is a homage to Terrence Malick's \"Badlands\". But while \"Badlands\" was about crime in a romantic setting, \"True Romance\" is a romance in a criminal setting. One is a nihilistic escape; the other is much more idealistic. Clarence and Alabama try to find a new path for their lives and escape from cops and gangsters, both equally antagonistic. Their escape is materialized by the 'Caribbean' tone of Zimmer's music, playful, sweet with a child-like lullaby purity, embodying a beautiful dream. And the closer they get to their dreams, the louder the music is, culminating with a powerful ending.And the dream's beauty is worth the deadly price. The dream-like nature of the romance illustrated by the music creates the perfect contrast with its sordid setting, allowing the story to create a dichotomy between love and violence with passion as their common link. The treatment of violence parallels love's connection to the future: it's less the violent moments that scare but the way they are patiently built up. Four times, the movie involves a confrontation where one has no chance AND nothing to lose, except a beloved one. And these scenes are cleverly slow paced and punctuated with thrilling exchanges, just to let us time to revise our prognostics. On that level, \"True Romance\" stands alone as one of the greatest action thrillers for four specific scenes magnificently written.The first scene seals the union between Clarence and Alabama when he decides to 'buy' her from Drexl. The pimp, played by Gary Oldman in a terrifying mix between Taxi Driver's Spot and Norman Stansfield, is defeated by the geeky Clarence who wins Alabama's freedom plus a briefcase of cocaine that would start the whole trouble with the Mafia and the Police. The second scene is probably the most praised and mainly remembered for its confrontation between two acting Gods: Christopher Walken and Dennis Hopper, the deliverer of the infamous \"Sicily\" monologue. These two scenes alone deserve to be mentioned among the best pieces of screen-writing from the last 20 years; from Clarence's bluffing confidence in the way he retells all the trivia about an obscure blaxploitation film airing on TV, to the story of Sicilians having African heritage that would have made Vito Corleone roll over his grave.The third scene involves a disturbing fight between the future Tony Soprano, James Gandolfini, and poor Patricia Arquette, the fight is so unequal that it's physically painful to see that poor creature beaten to death by that big thug. Yet, it powerfully serves the idea that one having nothing to lose can develops a superhuman strength. The last scene is the pay-off of the entire intricate plot, a Mexican stand-off where all the protagonists meet: the cops, the snitch, the dealers, the Mafia, Clarence and Alabama, for a final mayhem of bullets. \"True Romance\" is also a true thriller and a film served by great supporting performances through roles with extremely short life expectancies. Still, all these scenes have less in common their violence than the way they romanticize violence as the only answer when one has nothing to lose, where there's no passion without pain, no triumph without hardship. Whether it's Clarence challenging Drexl, his father provoking Cocotti or Alabama against Virgil, it's all about love.These scenes have another thing in common, they break taboos, cops die as casually as bandits, a man beats a woman, the ultimate insult to the Sicilians is made, and a ruthless pimp is defeated by a poor geek, fan of Elvis \u0085 The script defies all our conceptions of gangster and crime movies, playing both on the field of homage and iconoclasm. It's like the dream of a movie fan who's finally got the big role in the film, and this embodies the whole dream-like aspect of \"True Romance\", something transcended by the ending and sublimated by the last lines, some of the best I've ever heard in a film. The movie is pure geek-escapism but written with so much confidence that it refreshes all the dusty heritage of a genre as old as cinema, with a harrowing fantasy dimension.I mentioned before that Tony Scott's \"The Last Boy Scout\" had an entertaining value because we didn't have to care much for the plot, here not only we care for the story but also for the characters, and this is why the film is one of the few that belongs to the writer more than the director, a movie written by a man who loved films so much he decided to tell them his way... a young movie genius named Quentin Tarantino.",

There is an all star cast lead by Christian Slater and Patricia Arquette in their career best performances. Dennis Hopper (Easy Rider, Speed) and Christopher Walken (The Deer Hunter, Dogs Of War) eat up their 10 minutes of screen time in the greatest psychological confrontation in movie history. Val Kilmer (Top Secret), Chris Penn (Reservoir Dogs), Brad Pitt (12 Monkeys, Interveiw With A Vampire), Samuel L Jackson (Pulp Fiction, Jurassic Park), Michael Rappaport (Higher Learning), Tom Sizemore (Natural Born Killers), Gary Oldman (The Professional) and Bronson Pinchot all throw out some of the best performances in their careers into tiny parts. A simply stuuning Mexican stand-off and shoot out towards the end is one of the best gun fights in movie history. Great writing produces many, many memorable lines. Confrontations between Christian Slater and Gary Oldman, Patricia Arquette and James Gandolfini, and Brad Pitt vs anybody produce classic scene after classic scene. A great soundtrack, great story, and great cinematography boost this movie even higher. Plus trademark Tarantino style pop-culture references give it even more appeal. This movie is awesome.

This transcendence made every scene not only extremely important to the movie's plot, but also very entertaining. It also helped to make the movie more suspenseful because being a 'big name' did not mean that that actor would survive certain circumstances that they might normally.

Are there perhaps fanbois - devotees of the work of Tarantino, or Christian Slater or any of the dozen or so famous and talented contributors who are rating what they think these people can do, rather than what they actually have done - in this film - here?The basic story is fairly simple: Clarence and Alabama are thrown together - almost by chance - and they fall for each other. They also come - again more or less by chance - to find themselves in possession of a suitcase full of cocaine. A true romance grows - between the man, the woman and the illicit wealth...Some of the acting is top notch and some of the episodes in the tale are entertaining. The whole though, is a little disjointed: strong gory violence and drug taking are pretty much ubiquitous and just about the deepest message of the story is that some people get lucky while some notorious criminals and law enforcers can be absurdly incompetent and trigger-happy.Take, for instance the scene between Christopher Walken and Dennis Hopper. Perhaps these are impressive performances but the scene is both violent and exceptionally racist - and all for nothing. The plot motivation behind the racism is comparatively clear, but does that make it justified? Not for me. And does the scene advance the plot? Only really in the last couple of seconds, and only in a way that has been trailed far too obviously about five minutes earlier.We still have to wait a further fifteen minutes - about an hour into the movie - before things get going properly in a long scene between Patricia Arquette and James Gandolfini.By all means watch the film - enjoy the film - but don't forget that violence and drug-taking and racism have consequences - and not just for other people. In the real world, the central actors are more often damaged too.Overall 6.5/10",

            "content": "Plot Spoiler: This movie is terrible.There is no doubt in my mind that the reason Tarantino didn't direct this himself is because he is smart enough to see how sophomoric it is. It has all the gore, noise, dirty characters, \"hip\" dialogue and star-studded cast of his other films except it is missing one key element... artistry.Pulp Fiction and Reservoir Dogs: I will defend forever the necessity of violence in those movies. I am a big fan of Tarantino's directing, storytelling and interesting characters; this film has none of it. Because it wasn't directed by Tarentino, it has no taste. The movie treats its characters with as much care and interest as an injured wolf gnawing its own leg off. The script and direction treat the characters as obstacles to the action sequences (which there aren't many of).The violence usually associated with Tarantino (and his immediate influences like Peckinpah and Scorsese) appears for reasons unknown to Tony Scott. Violence is a way of life for the Wild Bunch or Nicky Santoro of Casino. The directors gracefully and lovingly examine the characters and foreshadow their downfall. We are not supposed to really like the characters, we are supposed to be entertained by them and enjoy their confusion amongst the terrible, dark situations they are thrown into. Here, Christian Slater plays the role as if it were Kuffs 2. He walks through the entire movie with a smirk on his face because he knows the ending of the movie and the size of his paycheck.This is not a Tarantino movie. Tarantino sold the script to fund Reservoir Dogs. True Romance has the feel of a Tarantino rip-off, but instead it is basically a rip off of everything he ever saw in that famed movie store he worked at. It is interesting for true fans of Tarantino to watch this movie and see him evolve from 'wannabe-tough guy movie maker', like Tony Scott, to his unique style of film for which he is famous.PLOT SPOILERSThe plot itself is completely unbelievable and so over the top that you want to take a shower in spring water and watch Beauty and the Beast. This movie is the epitome of \"glorified violence.\" Everybody in the film has to be a bigger badass than they were five minutes before. Watch the scene between Oldman and Slater or Hopper and Walken. Both those scenes are such crap that you wish Scott hadn't even bothered with plot. Basically he wanted to show how cool his characters can be. Those two scenes ruin the movie, no I take that back, it's a terrible movie, those two scenes emphasize how terrible it is. It is based on glamor and attitude, like a Britney Sears video, and has no basis in character development at all.The beauty of Tarantino's real films is the weakness of each of his characters (the gold watch, Jules' enlightenment, Mr. White's compassion, Mr. Blonde's sadism). The only character here that has any flaw is the character played by Bronson Pinchot. That character was created for comic relief, not out of an interest for his flaws and morals (or lack thereof). Not one action made by any character in the movie makes any sense. Alabama falling in love with Clarence after she is paid to have sex with him, Clarence deciding to go kill Drexl and his gang just because Drexl kicked one of Alabama's friends in the stomach, Clarence's dad suddenly becoming so badassed and hard-edged that he p***es off the one-dimensional Walken character... The only reason people think that scene is any good is because they recognize Hopper from his earlier roles in life, they obviously overlook how ludicrous it really is.Every action scene has our two heroes living, despite the odds. The scene where Alabama is beaten in the bathroom quite possibly is the most pointless, mind-numbing five minutes of film ever, especially because she lives. Give me a break! If the scene illustrated how terrifyingly she was murdered then maybe I could stand to sit through it. Why does a comic book salesman think he can escort his new girlfriend through a drug deal? It's not interesting in the least. It's stupid! The whole movie revolves around the idiocy of the audience. It depends on the viewer to become stupider with each scene to understand the ending. How the hell do they survive? That's not interesting! It's stupid! Nothing about this movie is any good.There is not much else to say, the movie is so unrealistic and so unbelievable that each scene makes less sense than the one before it and the audience quickly runs out of forgiveness.I was going to give this movie a 1 but then I remembered Brad Pitt's cameo and decided to give it a 2 out of respect for THAT actor and the only role in this movie that was believable. I lost a lot of respect for Oldman, Hopper, and Walken.*After reading the reviews to this film by users of IMDb.com I realized that nobody has seen any good movies. If I hear one more comment about the scene between Walken and Hopper I will buy the rights to this movie and burn every copy of it. Do yourselves a favor, rent a lot more Howard Hawk, John Ford, Sam Peckinpah, Martin Scorsese, and Sean Penn. They make great films. Tony Scott doesn't. Tarantino is not as original as you all think. I almost want to say I am not a Tarantino fan strictly on the basis of how simple-minded 90% of his viewers are.",

This movie is Tony Scott's 'magnum opus' or greatest work. I purchased a director's cut copy. Tarantino wrote a pop culture classic. Scott directed a love story like no other. Slater, a comic book salesman and movie enthusiast, played the part of a delusional 'King of pop'. Arquette, loyal hot pants, to pimp and then husband was alluring. Hopper was Hopper, a trustworthy father who passed his freedom loving genes to his son Clarence. Kilmer played Elvis in voice as the 'King of Pop' to a mentor driven Clarence. Walken has never been better as he played a Sicilian mobster after his cocaine deal went bad. Oldman played Oldman as the pimp, drug pusher, pirate of Detroit. Pitt played a minor part made major by his drug habits. Without major credit, James Gandolfini played Tony Saprano in the making.

After killing him, he goes to his father(Hopper) for help and meets a lot of interesting side characters. Great dialogue and dark humorous violence mix together to make this film. Also making up this film are the cameos by Samuel L. jackson, Val Kilmer and comic relief cameo Brad Pitt as Floyd the druggie roommate. SOme scenes let the violence take control, which are the worst scenes, but there aren't that many scenes like that. The film includes the breakthrough performance for Michael Rapaport as Dick Ritchie. The best performances were Walken as Vincenzo Cocotti the mobster and as mentioned earlier, Gary Oldman in a small role as a pimp named Drexl.R for sex/nudity, violence, lots of drug content and language. 116 mins.A minus.",

            "content": "Ever since I saw the indie classic `Reservoir Dogs', it felt like it was my mission to watch all the movies which was directed or written by the former video clerk. I have seen the mutterings of having cheeseburgers for breakfast in Pulp Fiction, the arterial spurts of a freshly chopped arm in Kill Bill Volume I, the double crossings of an air stewardess in Jackie Brown and the crazy obsession with celebrities in Natural Born Killers. So having read recently that QTs first major transcript was not Reservoir Dogs, but a movie I have not seen called True Romance. Basically I heard that this film was written way before the ear cutting classic. Sorry about the small story about the past works of one of the most influential directors of our time, but it helps me to be able to write this movie review.\nPOSSIBLE SPOILERS AHEADWe should start this review at the only place it should begin, which is at the start. The film starts of with a chance meeting between a call girl named Alabama and an Elvis fanatic called Clarence during a martial arts extravaganza in a seedy cinema. During the usual getting to know chit chat, it seems that they have truly fallen in love, and before long they get married. One day, Clarence finds out that Alabama has a pimp, who was a nasty piece of work. With this knowledge, Clarence anger rises and silently swears to the King of Pop that he will seek vengeance on the prostitute pusher. After eliminating this person, Clarence picks up a bag, assuming that it was his wife's belongings. Instead it turns out to be a large stash of uncut cocaine. His plan was to sell this whole amount of cocaine to a big Hollywood producer to make a tidy amount of money. However another element joins into the equation, such as a sadistic mob who are pretty irate about their cocaine being stolen and would do anything to get it back. That is where the real fun starts in this movie, with the gangsters being on the tails of this movie's Bonnie and Clyde. The casting ensemble for this movie is filled with some established actors as well as some up and coming actors who will become A-listed players. (Look at Brad Pitt and Samuel L Jackson for their bit parts in this movie) Christian Slater's character was believable, and he did have some aspects to make himself cool, especially liking Kung Fu movies and The King himself. Patricia Arquette played her character of Alabama, with some sexiness yet with simple and innocent way about it. Christopher Walkens made his role his own, by playing the stony face, sadistic Sicilian gangster. Dennis Hopper did do a good job on playing a simple living semi retired cop, who is the father of Clarence. However I do have to say that my favourite character in this movie was Bronson Pinchot's weasely, boot licking and cowardly portrayal of Elliot. This is probably one of his best acting screen time ever. Also, I do not want to forget the concept of Val Kilmer playing the King himself. It is a good thing that you do not see the King himself, but only his tacky gold suit, otherwise you would think that he would look nothing like Elvis.As the review title says, this movie does not go without any flaws at all. The first flaw is the directing. Tony Scott did a reasonably good job in the directing, yet I still felt that it was out of place with the dialogue given by Tarintino. Once again, I would have to say sorry about the biasness towards Quentin, but if he was behind the camera in this movie, it would have turn into a much better picture. Personally I did not like the Hollywood gloss given over the movie. It just seems too fake, even though there were visions of Elvis taking to this guy, and a gratitous amounts of violence. Also another thing I did not like, is the concept of Gary Oldman playing Drexel. To me it just does not make sense to get a white guy to play a Rastafarian. Would it not have been easier to have gotten a black guy to play this role. Sorry to have gone Spike Lee on all you readers, but I had to say what I had to say. This does not mean that Gary Oldman acting was rubbish in this movie, but it would have been better that this character was played by an Afro Carribean origin. To conclude, I do believe that this movie is very enjoyable, and great to watch, especially seeing cameos of soon to be big Hollywood players (Samuel L Jackson and Brad Pitt). Watch it if you like good crime movies with witty dialogue.",

Maestros like Walken and Hopper in the now classic Sicilian scene, Gandolfini in the equally infamous fight scene with Arquette, Pitt as a sedated stoner, Kilmer as a barely visible Elvis type imaginary friend.

I know, I know...I should be sort of used to this when Tarantino is involved...but it still didn't go over well.  I feel the use of the 'N' word was unnecessary in that case.  Nevertheless, seeing Walken and Hopper on screen together was awesome.  The violence was just overkill, the scene with Arquette and Gandolfini was just too much. And what was with the 'True Romance' of the movie?  What romance?  A call girl is called to give Slater a good time, and they end up falling in love? How are we supposed to believe that this is a 'true romance'??  Because they kiss every chance they get?  They've been together for like 3 days or such! Puppy love, anyone?  C'mon.  They could've given it a better title.  This movie has so much potential to be on the level of a Reservoir Dogs, you know, great.  But it falls short.** out of **** stars",

            "content": "I always thought that this was Tarantino's first movie, however he only wrote it rather than directing it, and also it appears that Reservoir Dogs did come out first. As I understand it, being a writer he had a lot less control over the finished product than he would have had if he directed it as well. Maybe it was because this film was somewhat more complicated than Reservoir Dogs (which is pretty much entirely set in a warehouse, with only a few scenes \u2013 and they tend to be flash backs \u2013 set outside).The story is about how a young man's boss gives him the birthday present of a prostitute who then falls in love with him (and him with her) so she renounces her former trade (she was only one for a couple of days) and moves in with him. However, as with all hopeless romantics, he decides to go and teach her old pimp a lesson (who turns out to be played by Gary Oldman) and lands up with copious amounts of uncut cocaine when he takes the wrong case. This, of course, attracts some unwanted attention, and they then decided to flee Detroit to go to Los Angeles to attempt to offload it.I do not necessarily want to call this a classic Tarantino movie since there is a lot of Scott's influence in it, however we have the quirky characters (such as Floyd, played by Brad Pitt, who is perpetually stoned, and seems to always manage to keep the mafia goons happy). Okay, there is none of the shock violence that one would expect to see in a proper Tarantino movie, but there is a classic, what I would call, a Tarantino standoff at the end of the movie (and I will not go into any more detail than that).I do really like this film, however the thing that I do think drags it down is the fact that Tarantino was not in the director's seat, which means that we do not get the same impression or feel as other films of his (such as Pulp Fiction, Inglorious Basterds, and Django Unchained). In fact, the film seems to try to have those strange and bizarre conversations that tend to punctuate his films, but simply falls flat.",

Had the potential though to be better & much of it's popularity is probably due to the great cast and also the director (who I personally don't rate, but everybody else seems to) rather than the plot.SpoilersTrue Romance lost marks because the film never actually covered that much ground & took a little long to get to the shootout which was basically the core of the film. The shoot out itself was also a slight farce as they tend to be when more than 2 are parties involved. Also, though the swearing was sometimes justified, half of the F-words that came out of Slater's mouth were completely unnecessary.For those 3 criticisms I'd have it at 7/10, still fairly good & excellent acting, from, just about everybody really.Two side issues. Was it me or did the Christopher Walkern, Sicillian character just disappear after the scene with Dennis Hopper & if so, why?It also never ceases to amaze me how people any scene, of any of these type of gangster related films (Snatch, Pulp Fiction, Lock Stock, Goodfellas etc) funny in any way. I'm not saying they're not good. They are, well the last 2 anyway, are brilliant, but not because they make me laugh. It doesn't matter what way people getting shot is jazzed up, I fail to see where the laughs are. Thankfully though this doesn't lessen my enjoyment at all, as I never expect to be in hysterics.",

He's a nice enough guy who doesn't have much luck with the ladies, so when Alabama walks into his life it seems like there's going to be strings attached... and there are. Through it all, however, the passion of the young wins through. If that sounds like it's going to be a little too weepy and predictable for the guys though, then you have the wrong film. \"TR\" is smart, sassy and brutal, with an all star cast and notable director delivering the goods at a fast and furious pace.Things settle into a more traditional and familiar vibe in the last quarter, but until then the delightful surprises come completely out of left field. Any scene from the first third, you could take on its own and make another different movie from. To that end, I say commission another script focusing on Gary Oldman's \"Drexl\", now!! It's nothing short of amazing how the British chameleon takes the character on the page and makes him come alive like you've never seen before! The dialogue is good, but his distinctive accent and appearance make this all about creating a memorably loathsome individual from the ground up. Brad Pitt actually performs a similar feat too - as the lovable stoner \"Floyd\" - with only slightly less impact.I love this film so much because it's full of some of the best characters you'll find in crime cinema.

But all credit to the movie and Quentin plus Tony Scott. QT obviously for writing the movie, that feels quite autobiographical - and I would have written that even without hearing him say it himself on the extras of the disc release I own. And much praise to Tony Scott too ... the script was tight, but what he made out of it ... and the cast he was able to assemble ... mind blowing is not doing it justice.Even smaller roles are filled with great actors ... Samuell L. Jackson having his first (short) appearance in a Quentin attached project. Gary Oldman being as evil as one can get - with a phenomenal accent. Christopher Walken, Dennis Hopper, James Gandolfini and so many more ... it is a bit like a who is who. I had forgotten how much screen time Brad Pitt had in this. I thought it was just one scene.This is a dream come true for a generation. Not just the movies that are referenced (John Woo, Sonny Chiba and so many more just visually or in the background on screens, big and small), but our \"romantic duo\". We never forget that this is a movie. We may dream to be able to do what the two main characters are able to do in their journey ... but we would never dare to do the stuff they do.The musical theme of our duo ... it is just amazing. Once you hear it you will know what is up. And then you have the dialog - the sicilian scene. Which apart from one little ad lib was written exactly like it is performed. Of course the performance takes it to a whole new level. Interesting back story on that piece of dialog in the audio commentary by QT himself. Who admit that he didn't like the ending Tony Scott was aiming at. I am glad Scott was able to box his ending through ... but if you are curious the other (original) ending is on the disc too.The disc also contains deleted/extended scenes ... one of which has a young Jack Black in it ... amazing what a great hand they had in casting ... that they were able to cut him out and still have this awesome group of people.The movie is fast paced, but never loses us. Even if Christian Slater had some issues with some banter (screaming) he had in a back and forth with Patricias character. But it makes sense - within their new relationship they have ... and within the scene and the movie. Alabama and Clarence - names one probably will not forget once seen and heard.There's so much goodness here - I probably am forgetting half of it. Like all the names of the actors - I could write so many things on every single scene. Many of which could be axed - and the movie still would make sense. There are things in this we do not need for the movie, the plot to move forward ... and yet those scenes make the movie what it is ... make it as awesome as it is. Do we need to know Rappaports struggle to become an actor? Not really - but it makes everything so much better for it ... you could boil it down and make fun of the characters ... but if you would do that, you would be making fun of a whole generation. And their dreams/fantasy ... let us dream, let us be entertained. Let art inspire us and be the escape it needs to be - yes pun intended.Edit: I did forget to mention one big cameo. Elvis - or the Mentor as he is being billed in the credits. Played by none other than Val Kilmer. And another example of the zeitgeist of the movie - of how connected it is with the people it is trying to reach. It may not have made a dent at the box office (at least not in America, UK being a completely different beast), but it has gathered quite the cult following ... and quite deservedly so. It is not for the faint hearted and best watched in the Directors cut. A movie that has many memorable scenes (the mentioned Sicilian scene being the topping) - something other movies can only dream of ...",

I could go on writing lists for hours, but these 24 words are True Romance. Really. If it were a person, it would proudly state that it lives in the United States of America and, chances are, it would probably be a hormonal 15-year-old boy. This might suggest that it is a shallow film, but as it one of Quentin Tarantino's first screen writing jobs, the shallow attributes are lovably shallow rather than stupefying.Tarantino's mind, I assume, resembles a glorified exploitation movie theater, bursting at the seams with Kung-Fu triple features and Spaghetti Westerns, rockabilly music drifting in the background of the foyer. True Romance is a chase movie on crack, exploitative in its violence but charmingly energetic in its dialogue and its acting; it's unbalanced, sometimes off-putting and sometimes gloriously enjoyable.The true romance on display rests on the shoulders of Clarence Worley (Christian Slater) and Alabama Whitman (Patricia Arquette), who marry after a whirlwind night surrounded by movies and bedsheets. Clarence is a comic-book nerd, a friendless average Joe who celebrates his birthday every year by watching a series of Sonny Chiba vehicles; Alabama, in serious contrast, is a prostitute, or, as she puts it, a call girl for the last three days. They're a mismatch made in heaven, he with his skinny, badly-postured mannerisms and she with her red lipstick, beach- blonde hair, and seedy fur coats.Though he's euphoric knowing that he's finally found Mrs. Right, Clarence simply cannot ease into domestic bliss knowing that Alabama's pimp (Gary Oldman) is still sneaking around, possibly looking for her. So, after a long-winded and seriously violent confrontation, he kills him, steals his suitcase of cocaine, and hits the road, his wife in tow. True Romance is directed by Tony Scott and stars Christian Slater, and those are the most prominent obstacles the film encounters in its explosive 120 minutes. When directing, Tarantino generally makes his violence comically bloody, silly even; Scott, on the other hand, doesn't have the same tongue-in-cheek attitude his writer does in terms of bloodletting, not always lining up with Tarantino's cavorting screenplay. The sequence in which Alabama is ruthlessly beat up by one of her dead pimp's associates is so disturbingly brutal that it mismatches the splintery, witty writing of the earlier scenes. Slater, while decent enough to be a distraction instead of a film destroyer, is miscast. His acting is too calculated, too cautious. In a film so unhinged, the lead must be just as unhinged; thank goodness for Arquette, Gary Oldman, and Christopher Walken, who are all tremendous, and, yes, unhinged.That's what makes True Romance so frustrating. 60% worth consists of absolutely brilliantly realized conversations, traveling with the ease of a continuous meet-cute, but the other 40% is composed of heinous violence that doesn't quite match the lurid wink of the remaining 60%.The violence is almost forgivable, but when you find yourself with a clearer image of Dennis Hopper getting his hand sliced open by one of Walken's henchman than Clarence and Alabama's initial meeting, it's much too difficult. But when True Romance is good, it's truly exceptional; there is a reason why so many consider it to be a classic of '90s cinema. Some might praise it for its climactic shoot-em-up, some might root for Clarence and Alabama's unconventional romance, and some might get a kick out of its dialogue. There's something for everybody, but one out of those three people will have a hard time consuming it all with no questions asked. Read more reviews at petersonreviews.com",

With True Romance, we get a healthy dosage of the raw energy and memorable dialogue one associates with Tarantino, wrapped up in a technically flawless and perfectly paced package. Certainly the best of the two worlds.True Romance is the story of a young loner who spends his time reading comic books and watching Kung-Fu movies. (I wonder where Tarantino came up with that angle!) He's watching a Sonny Chiba tripple feature at a mostly deserted movie house on the night of his birthday, when a beautiful young call-girl walks into the theater and into his life. She has only been a call-girl for a few days, and she's been sent to show this young man a good time. In their brief night together, these two fall deeply in love and get married. There are some problems, however.The young woman has a nasty pimp (It took me about four viewings to realized he's played by Gary Oldman!), and her hubby takes it upon himself to off this guy as an apparent symbol of his love for his new bride. After an extremely violent confrontation at the pimp's lair, our hero finds himself with a suitcase full of cocaine that he mistook for the young woman's belongings. That coke belongs to the mob, and let's just say that they'll do anything to get it back. They follow the young couple all the way from Detroit to L.A. in an attempt to take back what's theirs before the young couple can sell it off. The resulting action is incredible.The film is great on many levels. With the exception of Tombstone, I cannot recall a film where so much of the cast is made up of well-known actors. Many of them like Walken, Kilmer, and Hopper appear only briefly, but they leave a lasting impression on the viewer. And nearly the entire cast dies convincingly. Saul Rubinek does a priceless parody of Joel Silver.Some highlights include an interrogation of Dennis Hopper by Christopher Walken and a bunch of mafia goons. This conversation epitomizes why I love Quentin Tarantino. It is such a brutal scene, but you'll be howling with laughter before it's over.There is quite a bit of violence that some people will find difficult to watch. In one scene, Patricia Arqutte is beaten to a bloody pulp by James Gandolfini. Watch closely after the first punch he hits her with. The camera pauses on his face for a moment, and he gives a truly weird look. You can tell this character loves dishing out pain. Overall, this is not a family picture.The film delivers everything it tries to. The hip brutality of this film has helped set the tone for action films ever since.10 of 10 stars So sayeth the Hound.",

            "content": "True Romance, is about a young man named Clarence Worley, who one night in a movie theater meets a girl named Alabama Whitman, and after that they go get some pie and then go back to his place. Later that evening Alabama admits to Clarence that she is a call girl and was hired by Clarence's boss to sleep with him. Alabama tells Clarence, that she is in love with him and he is in love with her so they get married. Clarence one day decides to go and get Alabama's stuff which is being held at her pimp's place. His name is Drexl Spivey. Once Clarence gets there he kills Drexl, and most of the people in the room and along with getting Alabama's belongings he also takes a suitcase full of cocaine worth a lot of money. Clarence and Alabama then visit Clarence's father Clifford Worley, and tell him that they are going to California for their honeymoon. A man who works for a well known gangster visits Clifford and tries to find out where Clarence and Alabama are because apparently the cocaine belongs to his boss. So while in California, they have a gangster on their trail and while trying to sell the cocaine to a movie producer and things are not as they seem during the deal. True Romance, has good direction, a good script, good performances by everyone involved, good original music, good cinematography and good film editing. The version of the film I saw was the unrated version. True Romance, has some great dialog and is a very fun and entertaining movie. The film is full of action and thrills and it is all done very stylishly. The film is well made and has a good script by Quentin Tarantino, which he sold before he made his first film Reservoir Dogs. The film does have some flaws and some characters I might wanted to have seen and learned more about and some scenes kind of felt like they went on a little too long but the film is generally a lot better than most action films out there and the acting, writing and style of the movie make it also an above average action film. In fact the film is really good and it was a good film for Quentin Tarantino to have been involved in to start his career. A very good action film that is full of energy and will definitely appeal to action fans and fans of Quentin Tarantino.",

Generally, I refuse to see movie such as City of Angels, You've Got Mail, and I hated Sleepless in Seattle and Pretty Woman.  But, this movie was the second best romantic and cliched movie I have seen.  The best was Bonnie and Clyde, and that was probably original.*****SPOILERS*****SPOILERS***** Plot: Semi-sappy plot that would generally make me gag.  Guy and Prostitute fall in love.  Guy kills pimp, and runs with cocaine stash.  They plan on selling it to big producer for money to escape.  It was mentioned before that we should hate them for being drug dealers, and I think that the general public should not like it, but who would do crazy things for a little thing called love?  Every single action in the movie is done out of love and dedication.  Their ultimate goal is to run away and have a family.Acting:  Decent.  Slater was Slater.  However, in this movie, he was somewhat toned down from his normal Nicholson-esque acting, and you could see some emotion.  You could tell that the couple were truly in love, and it works really well.  The best roles were the secondary characters (although, Arquette is, as mostly, superb).  Brad Pitt as a pothead, Walken as a drug lord, Val Kilmer as Elvis, Gary Oldman as a pimp.  All of these roles are just perfect.The whole movie is done with enough finesse that you almost, but not quite, forget about all of the cliches in the movie.  The violence is over-the-top, almost no consequences in the movie, and it is almost a fantasy world, like how people feel when in love for the first time.  Highly recommended to all romantic types as a cross-over introduction to the violent cinema, and to all violent cinema lovers as a intro to romantic movies (it may not fully change you however.9/10",

The direction, by Tony Scott is slick and flashy, and the parts are well-played by a great cast (Gary Oldman, Dennis Hopper, Brad Pitt. Samuel L Jackson and Christopher Walken are among the great actors with cameos in this film).One of the main problems of the film is that it is very derivative (particularly of the 1973 Terrence Malick film \"Badlands\" and \"Bonnie and Clyde\").

            "content": "Guys like Quentin Tarantino and Kevin Smith burst out of the blocks, garnering massive critical acclaim for their originality and fresh approach to both dialogue and film-making in general. The unfortunate reality for both is that as their careers progressed they both fell in love with their own press and reputations, resulting in a loss of perspective and an inability to differentiate between truly entertaining moments; and self indulgent crap.That's why I strongly believe that for both of the above mentioned allowing other directors to take a crack at their scripts. Hopefully the fresh eye might be more likely to excise irrelevant and plain silly material, while keeping the core elements intact.I strongly doubt anyone else might've improved on the final versions of Pulp Fiction or Reservoir Dogs, but since then it's fair to say that Tarantino hasn't made anything rivaling either in terms of quality or longevity. (I'm not sure what anyone else would've made of Dogma, Clerks and Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back to be honest!) We'll never know what Tarantino might have done if allowed to proceed with his True Romance script, what I can say is that the guy who ended up with it did an extremely good job. Not quite great mind you, but about as good as I think this was destined to be.The tale of young lovers Clarence and Alabama Worley starts with them finding each other in Detroit, shows how they come into a large cache of drugs when Clarence decides to 'emancipate' his (now ex-)hooker wife from her menacing and dangerous pimp, and follows them as they flee cross country to LA to work out how best to turn the illicit stash into travellin' cash with which to finance their new lives.But True Romance is more than a rote tale of young lurrrve, it is essentially a series of memorable moments placed amid a sea of references to the obscure and unusual, references that Tarantino has since turned into a career obsession. The resulting Tony Scott helmed film contains Elvis, Kung Fu movies, wannabe-black white boys, comic books, B-movie references and of course long tracts of intricately crafted dialogue.As we saw in Pulp and Dogs, these speeches delivered from the lips of quality actors in between well directed passages of action often result in simply legendary output. Samuel L Jackson, Christopher Walken, Harvey Kietel and Steve Buscemi have the capacity to elevate. In lesser hands\u0085 er lips\u0085 not so good, (David Carradine, practically everyone in Death Proof \u2013 even Kurt Russell couldn't 'cool up' his banal speeches).True Romance manages a few classic moments and has introduced some legendary bit characters. In the moments category the stand off between evil mob boss Christopher Walken and humble everyman \u2013 and Clarence's Dad \u2013 Dennis Hopper is one for the ages.Gary Oldman squeezes every ounce out of his drug dealing pimp Drexl, and Bronson Pinchot gets many laughs in one of his less cartoony film roles as out of his depth PA to a big time Hollywood producer Elliot Blitzer. (Brad Pitt and Samuel L Jackson have less meaty roles but do what they can to remain in the memory banks.) The only misstep in my view is the inclusion of Val Kilmer as Elvis Presley, who appears only to Clarence as sort of his guiding angel \u2013 apparently this is a sign of Clarence's mental state but this is never really explained and comes off as a little too much \u2013 even in a film such as this.Aside from the King, True Romance works because it gets the mix right between violence, laughs and even music.Christian Slater and Patricia Arquette are both perfectly capable in the central roles as Clarence and Alabama while the rest of the cast try to steal scenes from them.Clarence is cocksure and confident, and Alabama is equally arresting and sassy \u2013 with Arquette's bouncing jubblies deserving acting credits of their own.It might have turned out better in Tarantino's hands, but I'm more than happy with what the underrated Tony Scott managed to conjure up. Given his track record of turning potential mediocrity into entertaining flicks such as The Last Boy Scout, Deja Vu and last year's Unstoppable I think he deserves as much credit for the end result as Tarantino does for coming up with the script in the first place.Final Rating \u2013 8 / 10. One or two moments from greatness. True Romance is certainly violent, profane and at times plain ridiculous. It is also fun, creative and extremely memorable.",

He keeps his cool, always has a line on his lips and faces off against the criminals, doing everything to defend his girl. True Romance does keep the promise given by it's title. It's a story about a couple wound up in a net of evil guys, backstabbing and a suitcase full of Cola, as the aspiring actor Elliot played by Bronson Pinchot calls it. The world of coke-snorting Hollywood guys and suave Italian mafiosi portrayed in True Romance, feels like a Tarantino world at every moment. In fact the whole film screams Tarantino. It's a romantic film in the sense that it romanticizes this world, and the idea that two lovers can get away from it if they stick together. The dialogue is as always with Tarantino top-notch.

This movie's full of funny dialogue - and with that, some pretty gruesome violence. For me, it's not very cohesive, and once we leave Detroit for California sunshine (when it goes overboard with the cigarette smoke and filtered light) it loses something. The first act is where the sweetness between Slater and Arquette really shines; once they get the drug deal rolling, we lose Walken and that cute couple and it's a standard Tony Scott movie. We get back to the romance at the end, but by then, I really did miss Walken (and Gary Oldman - man, that guy's nuts).It's the loud and in-your-face style that I wasn't really onboard with. Some Scott movies work pretty well. Some really don't. This was somewhere in the middle. And don't get me wrong, I'm not averse to violence; far from it. But here, it takes control.6/10",

            "content": "It all depends on your definition of Romance\nAfter the surprise success of Reservoir Dogs, Quentin Tarantino managed to get another of his writing efforts made into a film and the result, which is called True Romance, features quite a lot of blood, profanity and some strange dialog. True Romance is basically a romantic thriller and by that I mean romantic in the really broad sense, because for most people romantic is when you have a candle lit dinner under the stars. The main characters in this film though, Clarence (Christian Slater) and Alabama (Patricia Arquette), do not do that sort of stuff and I must say that, although I understand their feelings for each other, they really have a screwed up definition of the word romance. \nThe thrilling element of the film comes from the fact, that almost throughout the entire film, Clarence and Alabama are hunted by a bunch gangsters who want to kill them. Now Clarence and Alabama are no angels, but when they are not in the criminal circle both of them are very open and pretty cool, so not matter what happens, you start to like them and feel for them. This enables the film to maintain a pretty high level of thrill throughout, except for the scenes where nothing of that tension shines through and it is as if Clarence and Alabama have a life without worries and this is what gives True Romance a weird, yet original touch. I do not know if this touch made the film worse than it could have been, but I certainly cannot imagine the film without it.\nThere are some similarities between True Romance and Reservoir Dogs. First of all, the events in True Romance also happen in a criminal milieu. Second of all, there is quite a lot of profanity and blood. And third of all, there is (as in Reservoir Dogs) some strange dialog, which I think only Tarantino could have produced. I mean everybody who has seen Reservoir Dogs remembers a couple of crazy dialogs from that film, like the scene in which all of the guys are talking about the meaning of the song \u0091Like a Virgin' or the scene in which the \u0091nick-names' are given to the gangsters. True Romance features a couple of dialogs like that also, for instance right in the beginning, when Clarence talks about Elvis to some blond in a bar or when Clarence's dad (Dennis Hopper) tells some gangster from Sicily, where his ancestors come from. I enjoyed those dialogs and I think together with the ending monologue by Alabama, those are probably the best lines in the film.\nOverall, this is not a bad film, but it seems to lack that extra something. I feel, that the viewer is not sucked into the story enough and I also feel, there are some scenes which need some work, for they feel awkward or are unnecessary bloody and / or emotional. Those scenes include the interrogation scene with Dennis Hopper, the last scene with James Gandolfini and the last scene with Chris Penn. Don't get me wrong, this is by all means a good effort, but it is not good. Maybe Tarantino should be the only one allowed to direct Tarantino stories. \n7 out of 10",

And the ending made a whole lot more sense. It's a shame that Director Tony Scott tried to improve on the script. It would have been much better if done Tarentino's way.",

Vincenzo Coccotti  Bronson Pinchot ....  Elliot Blitzer  Samuel L. Jackson ....  Big Don  Michael Rapaport ....  Dick Ritchie  Chris Penn ....  Nicky Dimes  Tom Sizemore ....  Cody Nicholson Many of you will find this movie to violent and raw and to you I can suggest getting the cut version,actually this is the version that is easiest to get.The uncut version does only exist in some countries,and are not for people who can't stand blood and much violence. One of the things the uncut version show us more from,is the scene where Patricia Arquette is almost beaten to death,this is a really strong scene and I must admit I had problems watching it.You feel so sorry for her,and it is not often you see a girl get beaten,so I advice you to look away or get the cut version,because you get this sad feeling inside of you.But if you look away from all the violence,there is till a great love story and a entertaining plot. This movie also feature one of the really great scenes in movie history,I am of course talking about the scene with Dennis Hopper and Christopher Walken when they are talking face to face and tries to show us who is the toughest.Go see this one,it has humor,violence,every famous actor out there,cool story,love story,yeah actually everything you can wish for.9 out of 10.",

Men in the story are teenagers or they all have teenagers minds, they are addicted to comics and pulp fiction, they love cinema if cinema was invented when the action takes place, there must be a scene in a cinema theater or at least in front of a TV set in these films. Girls are gorgeous and hookers. Morality plays an important role, but is of a special kind. There is a lot of violence in this films, so well filmed that viewers know it's not true and they have fun watching it. Martial arts are the real art.Some of the Tarantino films are made by Quentin Tarantino. Some other not. 'True Romance' is not, but it's written by Tarantino, it was made 20 years ago but looks as fresh as if it was made yesterday, which shows that the genre beyond other qualities also has the one of aging nicely. It's a gangster story, it's a love story, it's a crime comedy about a young couple semi-willingly becoming murderers and unwillingly becoming drug dealers, it's a road movie, it's a movie about Hollywood. And it's fun to watch.There are so many good things in this film that I have a hard time picking which one to list. Dialogs and the musical score (Hans Zimmer - see the list of the films he composed for at IMDb and you will understand why you loved even more some of the best films in Hollywood in the last 30 years) are exquisite. Acting is stellar with the lead exception of Christian Slater which I simply cannot force myself to like. Lucky me, he is paired in the film with Patricia Arquette, and then we have Dennis Hopper, Brad Pitt, James Gandolfini, Christopher Walke, Gary Oldman ... wow ... each of them in supporting roles hard to forget.The director of this film is Tony Scott, who died last year. He was among these directors who would never get an Oscar because he just made the films that pleased the crowds. 'True Romance' is however much more than a crowd-pleaser, it may be T.Scott's best and one of the best Tarantino films ever made.",

            "content": "'True Romance' is instantly recognisable as a Tarantino film, although it is directed by Tony Scott, with the writing credits attributed to Tarantino. The cast is promising, and the opening credits intrigued me with the promise of performances by Dennis Hopper, Brad Pitt, Christopher Walken, James Gandolfini and a host of other acclaimed actors. The lead roles are played by Christian Slater and Patricia Arquette, as a couple of cinema-goers who stumble upon one another and inadvertently fall in love. The plot soon acquires an action- thriller narrative as drugs, pimps and gangsters infringe on the couple's peace. Arquette handles her role well and plays some scenes excellently, but I'm not so sure about the casting of Slater: I think there was substantially better talent on-hand for 'True Romance', and I have to say that I didn't enjoy Slater's performance very much at all. One of the most talked about scenes of Scott's film seems to be the one between Dennis Hopper and Christopher Walken, perhaps the two most distinguished actors in the film (at this point). The scene is certainly decent, but doesn't really seem integral to the wider story. Many of the other scenes take a very Tarantino-esque approach: heated arguments are made between characters, followed by a bloody shootout. I think that this is milked somewhat in 'True Romance', and I thought that a lot more restraint could have been shown. The whole film seems like a proto-'Pulp Fiction', but with less interesting characters and developments. I also noticed that by the 45-minute mark, every character in Scott's film annoyed me for a different reason. The whole production is as inexplicable as 'No Country for Old Men' and as desperate as '25th Hour', but lacks the strong characters and narratives that defined both of these superior drugs-themed films.",

            "content": "It's interesting to note that this same screenplay spawned 'Natural Born Killers' the year after 'True Romance' was released. I love that movie to pieces and it has a lot more to say than this one, but that should not be taken as an affront to an enjoyable film- which is exactly what 'True Romance' is. Christian Slater and Patricia Arquette are Clarence and Alabama Worley, two relative innocents- a comic-book store clerk and a call girl- who fall in love after his boss hires her to sleep with him. He develops an instant hatred for her pimp, so he puts a gun in his sock and goes to visit. Her pimp is Drexl, played by Gary Oldman as a half frighteningly realistic and half laughable 'wigger'. A shootout commences, from which Clarence flees with a suitcase filled not with Alabama's things as he had though, but with cocaine. He realizes he and Alabama could definately use the kind of money that can be made off selling it, so they skip town and head to L.A. after briefly visiting his dad. From there they get mixed up with a famous actor named Elliott, an aspiring one named Dick, Dick's pothead couch potato roommate, Floyd, and a whole gallery of folks who want them dead. 'True Romance' ends well but goes at a fast clip and feels shorter than what it is- for one thing, the time is never taken to develop the sense of inevitability of love between Clarence and Alabama that was created between Mickey and Mallory Knox. Nonetheless, Christian Slater is enjoyable as a guy who knows he's in over his head but is trying to do his best in the situation, and Patricia Arquette has one of her best roles in that guy's cute, not-as-dumb-as-she-seems wife. Her scene with the goon sent to collect the cocaine from their hotel room is both nauseating (who wants to see our heroine get her face bashed in?) and terrific, (how often do you get to see a woman win a brawl this nasty in the movies?) and from it and her ending voice-over, you know that this woman is a survivor through and through. Fun, well-done, and fast-paced, 'True Romance' is a worthy companion film to 'NBK' or, indeed, just about any of the other movies Tarantino has scripted.",

So I picked up the movie, hoping that if it become a mess I at least enjoy watching Patricia Arquette.And I was unfortunately right. The movie is simply a crap. Starting from the silly story, non-convincing acting and stupidity of the main characters - all this makes the movie a disaster. I was watching it, hoping \"it will start to make sense on next scene\". But it did not. I don't know why ratings are so high here - it says \"Tarantino\" in the credits, so maybe people think, \"Oh, it can't be crap. I just missed the point. It's my fault\". And they rate it then - 8, 9, 10(!) for no real reason.I rated it 4 stars (and I think 3 would be still fair enough): 1 star for Gary Oldman's scene in the club, 2nd star for stoned Pitt scene and last 2 stars for Arquette (but the credits here goes rather for Mother Nature, not for the her \"acting\" I am afraid).To summarize: if you love B/C class movies - give it a try (but don't expect the Godzilla in it anyway).

Many extremely unforgettable scenes were present in this film in particular the Hopper/Walken scene which provides humor, history, and a heck of a lot of drama. The Gandolfini/Arquette scene was perhaps the most intense sequence ever put on film. And of course Slater/Oldman have a very amazing scene with great dialogue and a lot of action.

            "review_title": "This Movie's Nuts",
            "content": "Revisiting Tony Scott's True Romance for the first time since somewhere in the throes of high school, I find that, as a lifelong Tarantino admirer, everything that tends to annoy me about Tarantino is more evident here than in any of the films he directed himself. And yet what is also evident is what shocked critics and audiences about Tarantino's work that jumpstarted the new generation of movies. There is an unhinged, guileless relatability to his material. Everything he writes is so rich and ripe. True Romance, nevertheless, implodes on itself. It is so inundated with homage, references and explosively gruesome set pieces that it seems to obliviously waltz right past countless opportunities for real drama so that it can continue on its path of totally, completely external and over-the-top narrative clockwork.You see, when I was 12, I could invest myself in Clarence and Alabama's romance, because I felt like a Clarence, just like a lot of 12-year-old boys who watch a lot of movies. So that's how I fantasized that it would be one day, that we suddenly happen upon the perfect beautiful buxom blonde hooker who likes whatever we like, and worships us from then on. I'm 21 now. Perhaps the least interesting thing to me now is the eponymous romance. Like the relationship between Catherine Deneuve and Susan Sarandon in director Tony Scott's first film The Hunger, the dimension to Clarence and Alabama's is too entrenched in male fantasy to be completely convincing. And let's not get so carried away with these theories about Clarence picking up where Travis Bickle left off. It's not exactly a ridiculous or even invalid theory, but let's look at what Clarence really is, which is why so many guys respond to this movie: He is in some way how we see ourselves when we are preteens and (successfully) acts upon all of the sexual or violent or adventurous fantasies that obsess him and derive from an overwhelming intake of popular culture.This is clearly exemplified when Clarence goes to kill his new wife's pimp, specifically acknowledging that he is haunted by the fact that he's breathing the same air as him and getting away with it every day, that he doesn't deserve to live. Revenge and retribution take the thematic cake in the QT canon. In each Tarantino script, something goes awry in the life of some cruel, brutal and violent men due to the intentional actions, or farcical negligence, of other people. Brutal and violent behavior ensues, and yet there are glimpses of compassion and morality among the tough, cruel and depraved people that populate them, according to their own self-conscious universe. True Romance is the epitome.The best thing about the movie by far is its renegade structure of reserving entire self-contained scenes for characters who we haven't seen before and won't see much after, interacting with another character who's been introduced already and probably won't live to see his third scene. The pinnacle of the effectiveness of Tarantino's free-wheeling narrative feature is the much-discussed scene between Christopher Walken and Dennis Hopper. In eight pages of dialogue, Walken delivers every line so coolly, with Hopper not much with which to answer except \"What are you talking' about?\" and \"I don't believe you.\" But Walken creepily alternates between cruelty and empathy. Then when he slides in for the knockout, it turns out to be a cool, jaw-dropping rope-a-dope. The two veterans' attentiveness is unreserved, their performances candid, so they just lean back and Scott's camera catches them every time, never letting them fall.Overall though, it's ultimately all dressed up with nowhere to go, only really indicating how it's supposed to be read through intertextual links with other films. Each character and plot strand is either transplanted from vintage plot formulas, specific films, or classic character and scene stereotypes. Characters don't relate to the world in any manner except through celebrity idols, movies, music or character embodiments emerging straight from those very worlds. Natural Born Killers achieved a traumatic degree of satire with such material, but True Romance takes itself very seriously, indulging it exactly what Stone held up to horrifying censure, much to its writer's odd chagrin. It's a soap opera hiding in the Heroic Bloodshed genre wrapped in a Badlands homage with exploitation dressing.Tony Scott, the ultimate post-MTV filmmaker, has always worked exclusively in the commercial American industry. His films have always been unabashed business and mostly within the action/thriller genres. He's certainly not as mercenary as Michael Bay, and his choice of projects is more interesting. Regardless, he places emphasis on slick, high-concept narratives while drawing heavily from the diffused, neon-tinged visual style of music videos and commercials, complete with rapid-fire editing and prominent rock soundtracks. True Romance is no exception, and he retains his own familiar quick cuts, colored filters and swanky production design while achieving the allusive pop culture awareness of its writer's own directorial work. It's a big, fat pop culture chocolate cake. And just like regular chocolate cake, the older we get, the more we start to appreciate treats of nutritional value.",

Not to be mistaken for a Tarantino film (though he did script it and his idiosyncrasies are clearly apparent) this is fluid, offbeat, and hilariously profane with some sensational dialogue and highly stylized violence to boot.

I can handle swearing no problem, but the sheer amount of f-bombs and vulgarity was entirely unneeded.However vulgar the lines, a stellar performance by the actors can make it tolerable...I mean, Boondock Saint's was an incredible movie! But Boondock Saints also had incredible acting. Not a single one of the characters in True Romance held any sway over my emotions.

Patricia Arquette is particularly good.Clarence (Christian Slater) plays a complete fool, who lives in a fantasy world, and tries to live out a movie fantasy. Reality occasionally rears it's ugly head, but never when Clarence is around to see. He never has to face any consequences for his foolishness. He never even finds out that his actions lead to the death someone close to him, much less grieve for the poor fool.The ending is a complete cop-out. We're asked to maintain the same state of denial that Clarence is in. (Don't read the rest of this paragraph if you don't want to know.) Imagine if the Godfather ended with Michael and his wife breaking out the Champagne bottles to celebrate his victory over his enemies, then living happily ever after.Years after seeing this movie, I found Quentin Tarantino's script in a bookstore. Wow! What a great script. It's the same story, but it's structured differently, and it works a lot better. It also has a much more believable ending, which doesn't descend into codependence. It's too bad Tony Scott had to butcher the film. Don't see this movie. Read Tarantino's script.",

Tony Scott should have stuck to directing Military/espionage movies (i.e Crimson Tide and Enemy of the State). Christian Slater does his best to be convincing as the Love addicted Clarence but will only disappoint the viewer. Arquette is on babe duty and i think that draws attention away from the fact that she is a bad actress.I think what makes this movie interesting is that we get to see big movie star's before they became famous (i.e. Pitt, Gandolfini, Slater, Kilmer).All in all the script is pure QT, but with Slater and Arquette in the lead roles and with the guidance of Tony Scott, Tarantino might as well disown the movie.",

Was this Gandolfini's first \"sensitive hitman\" role? Patricia Arquette is yummy, Hopper is in rare form, Walken is as menacing as he is weird, Oldman makes a great pimp, we find out about Samuel L's sexual preferences, and Slater manages to turn in a credible understated but high energy performance. A monument to the Nintendo generation I suppose but a great movie worth watching over and over again. Oh yeah, if you're quick to scream \"ripoff\" when you see a road movie that resembles True Romance, NBK, Freeway, Love and a 45, etc then pick up a copy of Badlands with Martin Sheen.

Each character that comes on the screen is just as memorable as the next one. Both Slater and Arquette give great performances and have good chemistry with each other. Gary Oldman as Alabama's pimp is terrific. He is sinister, evil, and greedy at the same time. The supporting cast consisting of Michael Rappaport, Brad Pitt, Dennis Hopper, James Gandolfini, Saul Rubinek, Tom Sizemore, and Chris Penn all do stellar jobs in their roles. There are only 2 problems with this film.

Before I continue, the man is dead, I'm hesitant to throw stones at somebody who is no longer with us, but I only found that out a little while ago. But as for what Tony fondly refers to as the British school of direction, smacking his leading lady through the face to get her to sufficiently emote for two scenes in this movie (the romantic 'billboard' scene where Clarence finds her softly weeping outside on the roof, and the one where she thinks Clarence is dead)... Isn't it just too damn much that the movie that is notorious for its violence against women (the James Ganfolfini Virgil beating up Alabama scene is surely the cinematographic zenith of just exactly this, and IF THERE IS SOMETHING OUTDOING THIS, KINDLY DON'T BRING IT TO MY ATTENTION, I DON'T WANT TO SEE IT) had a director that slapped an (in basically his own words) innocent kid with a child-like quality through the face? To get her all teary- eyed after a grueling shooting schedule when she wasn't able to project herself as the script required... Believe me, I do understand. I just find it absolutely appalling. Hell, is this what they did on PARTY OF FIVE? Imagine if that was what they did on weepy old PARTY OT FIVE!As for the movie, I find it overrated. Everybody's so damn pleased, it is such a beloved classic. To me it seems that as long as you satisfy people's need for on-screen violence (which this one does in spades!), it is just hunky-dory, everybody is so peachy- keen on it, nobody's complaining, the reviews are favorable EVEN THOUGH THE EFFING THING FAILS TO MAKE ANY EFFING SENSE! I could point out that I find obnoxious Virgil's comment re the first time you kill, how difficult that is, to be what-I-accept-to-be the truth. Yet killing doesn't affect Clarence, he takes to it like a duck to water, he is therefore a natural born killer (ha! No pun intended) yet he is supposed to be a sweet comic book store Average Joe, Oh For Crying Out Loud I Rest My Case, I won't go on this any further (my tea is getting cold), the script is torn between a madman genius's schizophrenic bipolar conflicted mind's disparate working.From the start, especially there in the movie theater, Patricia reminded me of Christina Applegate (Kelly Bundy in MARRIED WITH CHILDREN) and I'm pretty sure the two are interchangeable :)",

More glitzy and highly charged than most of Tarantino's work, it is still peopled with characters typical of his films - lowlifes and strange gangsters - and is full of clever, sharp and insightfully humorous dialogue.Perhaps the romantic element is misplaced, and the Elvis factor may not be entirely effective, but certainly each encounter the Morley's have with their pursuers, and that the pursuers have with others, is enjoyable and action packed, even occasionally gruesome.Had he directed, Quentin would probably have turned this into a real philosophical trip, ala \"Pulp Fiction\", yet director Tony Scott has gone all out for the shoot 'em up style, delivering romping entertainment while neglecting the deeper probings of Q.T.'s script. This is not to say that Mr. Scott has let us down, but if you don't like full on, in your face action flicks, you'd better forget about this one.All the cast, quite an ensemble, have a great time, especially the walk-ons. Gary Oldman, Dennis Hopper and Christopher Walken are most enjoyable. Leads Christian Slater and the sexy Patricia Arquette hold up very well. Brad Pitt, Samuel L. Jackson, Chris Penn, Saul Rubinek and Val Kilmer also drop in on proceedings.Hans Zimmer's music works reasonably well, cinematography is exciting and gunplay action sequences are nerve racking. Editing keeps things well paced. Never a dull moment.Friday, February 23, 1996 - Astor TheatreTony Scott's boisterous, high energy action flick, which is peopled with characters and dialogue typical of Quentin Tarantino (the writer), is highly recommended to those who enjoy their movies loud, fast and with loads of gunplay.While Scott keeps the action coming thick and fast, Tarantino maintains a steady supply of lowlifes to keep us equally entertained. Leads Slater and Arquette do fine, but it is the support cast that grab our attention. Gary Oldman is totally absorbed in his character as always, playing a white pimp whose psychosis has him convinced he's anything but white. Just as entertaining are Christopher Walken and Dennis Hopper, and the scene played between them is a particular highlight. Joining the fun also are Brad Pitt, Val Kilmer, Chris Penn, Saul Rubinek and Samuel L. Jackson.Colourfully funny and always pacey, \"True Romance\" is a great one off adventure (at the movies especially) that features a handy score from Hans Zimmer.Sunday, April 20, 1997 - Video",

            "content": "It was great to see the humble beginnings of Quentin Tarantino. True Romance was the first script he sold. He wanted to direct it himself but no one was willing to give him the chance so Tony Scott got the job. I haven't heard much about Tony Scott but I think with Tarantino directing it would have been a better movie. It lacks that goofy feel that pervades through Tarantino's movies. The love for movies and just plain fun that is so integral to a Tarantino movie is missing in True Romance. Still, True Romance is a good movie. Stylistically influenced by Terence Malick's 1973 film Badlands it also stands as a movie in its own right. Who knew Tarantino was such a sap and could right halfway decent romantic dialogue? The voice-over narration and the background score is where it heavily borrows from Badlands and of course the serial killers on the run. But Alabama and Clarence aren't serial killers on the run. They are just people wanting to start over and try to live a better life, a happier life. But Tarantino will not let them do it easily. There are gangsters, Hollywood movie producers, old friends, drugs, policeman and guys with wires. More often than not Tarantino's movies have a variety of different plot that collide and all hell breaks loose. We witness this again and have a Mexican standoff. I guess that is where the problem lies. Tony Scott just directed the movie and I guess he didn't care so much about the characters and the Mexican standoff became very predictable in the last half hour of the movie and the action scenes were a little too cheesy.The supporting cast features some of the biggest stars of today. Brad Pitt, James Gandolfini to name a few. Back then I guess they were just starting out. It is great fun to see a young James Gandolfini a couple of years before he played Tony Soprano doing what he does best. It's surprising how Michael Rappaport frequently plays the old friend of the lead character. He plays the same character in Beautiful Girls and some Schwarzenegger movie. I guess this was the movie that made him typecast in that role. The cast is decent. I never really like Christian Slater that much. His voice always irritates me but he's done a decent job in the film. The female decent is quite good actually. She is very pretty and plays her role with aplomb. True Romance is about well a True Romance. How two people meet and realize they are perfect for each other. It is about innocence and losing, grabbing chances and trying to struggle for something better. A better future. Because mostly things go wrong. But sometimes they go the other way too . . . . . .

            "content": "I love True Romance, loved it the first time, and still love it! Super fun, ultra-violent twist on classic love story. Extraordinary cast!!! The last really fantastic performance by Christian Slater, incredible improvised scene between Dennis Hopper and Christopher Walken, James Gandolfini doing what he did best years before The Sopranos, and a magnificent battle sequence between him and Patricia Arquette, who stands out as the all-too-rare STRONG female lead in a genre near entirely bereft of any, especially at the time. While Gary Oldman has a long list of outstanding performances--particularly as villains--from Leon the Professional to The 5th Element, I would argue that in his role in True Romance, more so than any other, he transforms himself into a character almost unrecognizable from either the other roles he's played, or himself as an actor. Even though he's got relatively little screen-time in this flick, he steals the show as one of the most memorable performances. Across the board this cast was, and remains, unmatched both in raw talent/skill and chemistry. Even with their tertiary roles, actors like Tom Sizemore and Brad Pitt bring a levity and realism to their characters in a movie that could have easily fallen into the annals of hyper-violent 90s pulp schlock. The few characters/performances worth criticizing, like that of Balki from Perfect Strangers, or the big blonde body guard at the end, are completely forgivable in the face of this film's casting powerhouse.Classic Story!!! Although the story is relatively simple, it carries all of the central components to a classic archetype: redemption, sacrifice, true love, and tragedy. The simplicity of the story overall might feel boring or unoriginal to some, but I believe it frees the characters to have clear drive and compelling motives. A story with greater complexity would easily crowd a movie like this one, which devotes as much depth as it does to so many different characters.Nerd Cred!!! The movie opens with a loner comic book and martial arts cinema fan falling in love with a beautiful, incredible woman that loves those same things (and long before it was cool to like comic books). Clarence then proceeds to become a total badass, mirroring the super heroes from comic books in his actions and accomplishments. The film does a great job of masking this in its raw and desperately raced tone, but the subtext remains as a nod to old school fanboys, if not a shout out.This film is certainly not for everyone. If you're looking for a story with unpredictable twists, unconventional editing, top production values, complex plot elements, intellectual concepts, and/or visionary scope, this movie might not be for you. These are all fair criticisms to level against True Romance, but it's definitely not trying to be or embody these elements. This is a character, scene, and situationally driven story, and at that, True Romance is stellar ;)",

His James-dean style image adds a certain depth of character to his acting in this and many of his movies. Patricia arquette plays the role of Clarence's (slaters) girlfriend so well, that i stand here today and challenge any-man to tell me that you don't remotely want to love or get to know her in at least a small way. The way Alabama (arquette) genuinely falls for Clarence for me was one of the many fine-points about this excellent script. Coupled with the fact that there love for each other bonds almost instantly & Clarence's jackanapeses makes Alabama his perfect life-partner, because they are chalk & cheese plus she tames her Clarence!!. Both these factors make the scene - where James Gandolfini subjects her to the beating to obtain information, genuinely heartfelt for the viewer. Every thread inside me wanted to put gandolfini down, and have Alabama run back into Clarence's hands. Because there love for each other was just meant to be. Yes this film has a-lot of action & violence in it, but this just makes Quentin Tarantino's predominant love-story a-lot more genuine.

It features a cast of highly familiar faces, some who can act some who can't, but everybody pulls their weight here, and nobody upstages anybody else.In scene one, Chrisitian Slater sits at a bar and tells the girl next to him how he wishes he could be Elvis. It is ironic considering he got his wish seven years later, backing up Kevin Costner in 3000 Miles to Graceland. Tarantino loves bar scenes. Were he in the director's chair, this intro would be longer.So who IS in the director's chair then? True Romance is a film by Tony Scott, (who probably needs no introduction). Tarantino would surely not give his script to anyone unless he felt they would match his vision or intended approach. Scott clearly achieves this. The movie is played mostly for fun, yet it doesn't get carried away. Scott's direction is progressive. Tarantino films are much more slower. Even though True Romance gets increasingly more convoluted, so to does it get funnier, and it comes with a pretty good pay off. True Romance is definitely a forerunner to Pulp Fiction. Back in 1992, this would've been a good hint to the critics of what was to come from Quentin Tarantino. Pulp Fiction was definitely his most inventive feature, but True Romance may be more fun.",

            "content": "There are some films that you gladly forget about common sense and logic and just sit back to enjoy the energy of what your watching. Story is about Clarence Worley (Christian Slater) who works in a comic book store and watches kung-fu films and while sitting in a movie theater one night he meets Alabama (Patricia Arquette). They hit it off and go back to his place where after some lovemaking he finds out that she is a hooker that was hired by his boss but she really likes him and vows to give up prostitution. They get married and Clarence decides to go get her belongings from her pimp Drexl Spivey (Gary Oldman) but after a bloody altercation Drexl and his hired thugs are killed and Clarence grabs a suitcase and runs out. At home they discover millions of dollars in cocaine stashed in the case so they decide to go to California and look up his friend Dick (Michael Rapaport).*****SPOILER ALERT*****\n They arrive and Dick gets them a deal to sell the cocaine to a famous film producer for 200,000 dollars but the cops find out about it and want to make the bust but Italian gangsters are hot on Clarence's and Alabama's trail.This film was directed by Tony Scott who also directed \"Top Gun\" and he has shown good skill at directing action films that keep a steady and exciting pace. But the films real flavor isn't necessarily in the action but in Quentin Tarantino's wonderful script and dialogue. Even when the film slows down and there is no action taking place you're still enthralled by the words spoken by the actors and there is a truly memorable scene involving Dennis Hopper and Christopher Walken. The fact that these two terrific actors are interacting in a film was exciting enough but the scene between them is written so splendidly that it has become a classic. Slater is well cast as the hot headed but reckless Clarence and I've always been a big fan of Arquette. They have good chemistry together and this helps the film as we watch this story unfold. The cast is top notch and along with the main leads you can see Brad Pitt, Bronson Pinchot, Samuel L. Jackson, Saul Rubinek, Conchata Ferrell, James Gandolfini, Chris Penn, Tom Sizemore and Ed Lauter. Also, Val Kilmer pops up from time to time as the ghost of Elvis that mentors Clarence in his actions. I personally could have done without the whole Elvis/Ghost part of the story but this is just nit picking because this is a whole lot of fun to watch. This has more than it's share of violence but this film is highly stylized and generates an abundant of energy that never lets up.",

            "content": "True Romance failed to interest me enough. I didn't really care about anyone or anything. It was interesting watching one of Tarantino's very first screenplays come to life, and it was actually pretty good, however it was nowhere near as creative as the other films he wrote. This isn't exactly what Tony Scott does best. While The Last Boy Scout and Beverly Hills Cop II were directed with skill, he fails to fully satisfy with True Romance. I've always wondered how this movie would turn out if Tarantino had directed it instead. He could probably have done it better. But ultimately, the plot is so poor that even if Tarantino would direct it, it would still be a sinking ship.Christian Slater and Juliette Lewis are pretty good though, but what really saves True Romance is the exceptionally great supporting cast, notably Gary Oldman and Christopher Walken, who deliver top-notch performances. They are, without a doubt, the best thing about this movie, despite their screen time is no longer than 10 minutes combined. Another supporting role worth mentioning is Brad Pitt in a two-minute role. His character is a major influence on stoner comedies later on, and it is this small role that, in my opinion, was the first to define how good his acting abilities actually is.Overall, True Romance is worth the price of admission, because of the great supporting cast and Tarantino's (occassionally) good writing. - Moose finds this film worthy of an 8.",

Then came the spat between Tarantino and Tony Scott when Scott wouldn't allow the rights to revert back to Tarantino, so he could direct it. And it's not a surprise that Tarantino would have wanted to direct it, because it's a great movie.The title is correct, the movie is about a romance. A romance surrounded by all the stylish violence and well-written dialogue that you would expect from a Tarantino movie.\u00a0Call girl Alabama (Patricia Arquette, the best part of the movie) and store clerk Clarence (Christian Slater, in the best role I've ever seen him in) meet and fall madly in love one night. The next day they're married, and Clarence gets the notion in his head to kill Alabama's former pimp. It's all cascade of drugs, violence, mobsters, cops, and movie producers, from there.I don't know if there has ever been an on-screen couple that I rooted for more than Alabama and Clarence. They both go through A LOT of stuff for each other. Their relationship is never melodramatic is sappy, it's the kind of thing that puts a smile on your face to see two people who are just obviously perfect for one another. You can't help but want the two of them to get out off all this okay.I can't help but think that the music used in the movie would have been better if QT had been able to direct it, but there's not much else about the movie that I can complain about.

Though Tarantino is listed only as \"writer,\" TRUE ROMANCE seems to be the middle child of what could be construed his breakout trilogy, bookended by RESERVOIR DOGS (1992) and PULP FICTION (1994).Comics/kung fu geek Clarence Worley (Christian Slater) marries naif hooker Alabama (Patricia Arquette) after just one night of molesting her mungus ta-tas, and resolves to rescue her from debauchery and bad people (which is somewhat ironic, considering he uses a big shiny gun to do so.) Cross country to The City of Angels they flee, with $5 million in cocaine that Clarence unwittingly steals from Alabama's pimp after a Very Serious Shootout.So begins a series of vicious vignettes, featuring a sm\u00f6rg\u00e5sbord of delicious cameos. Dreadlocked Gary Oldman is Alabama's pimp Drexl, more nigga than wigga (\"He musta thought it was White Boy Day!\"); diabolical Christopher Walken is unstoppable mob boss, Mr. Coccotti, who slams up against the immovable force of Clarence's working class father (Dennis Hopper) in the most intense genealogical examination of \"the n*gger gene\" this side of a Klan rally; James Gandolfini is - what else? - a hit-man, which would inform his own breakout role soon enough in THE SOPRANOS; Brad Pitt, hilarious in a tiny stoner role; Michael Rappaport is Clarence's bad actor buddy who just landed a role on T.J. HOOKER (Clarence: \"You get to meet Captain Kirk!\"); Val Kilmer as Clarence's inner Elvis monologue.If ever there was a dialog-driven scene for aspiring young actors to hone your emotive palette, grab the few pages of Hopper and Walken. If you can pull off the galaxy of nuance between those two acting leviathans seemingly jovially discussing telltale signs of lying and eggplants, yet with the undercurrent of lives in the balance, you're ready. Call William Morris.Honorable mentions to Bronson Pinchot (with sweater tied around neck, like he is part of a Country Club who is embarrassed to admit he is a member) as a director's gopher, misrepresenting himself as only those whom Country Clubs repudiate can; and Saul Rubinek as the esteemed Hollywood director so egotistic he believes he can have someone killed if they cut him off on the highway.With the uplifting music of Hans Zimmer sparkling the savage storyline, TRUE ROMANCE is a paean to youth and freedom and impulsiveness and righteous wrongdoing, oozing that insouciant hipness that Tarantino does so effortlessly. And yes, it all leads to that Tarantino trademark of everyone pointing a gun at everyone else.True love is so much more romantic when hookers and drugs and guns are involved.",

Christian Slater, Patricia Arquette, Gary Oldman, Val Kilmer, Brad Pitt, Christopher Walken, Dennis Hopper, Tom Sizemore\u0085.I mean come on, how could it not be a cool movie? I was told that I had to watch this movie by several friends, but for some self-admittedly ignorant reason, I was always put off by the name as romantic comedies usually make me gag\u0085with a few exceptions. This is no romantic comedy and I'm glad I came across this film. And if you're an Oldman fan, this flick is essential to your collection.Minor Spoilers:Clarence (Slater) and Alabama (Arquette) meet when Clarence's boss hires a hooker for him for his birthday, with instructions to not let him know who and what she really was. As it turns out, the couple instantly falls in love and after a short night together, and they spontaneously decide to get married. Clarence becomes obsessed with the fact that while Alabama was only a call girl for a day or two and had only a few customers, that she actually had a sinister pimp named Drexyl (Oldman) who was also a big drug dealer somewhere out there. With the advice of Clarence's imaginary friend and mentor, Elvis (Kilmer), he decides that he cannot be happy until Drexyl no longer exists and decides he must be taken out. The confrontation starts a whirlwind of events that the couple must somehow get through before they can live together in peace. It all comes down to a huge climax with guns drawn, bullets flying and much bloodshed. Will they survive and live happily ever after?I love this movie and am quite surprised that it's not at a loftier position on IMDB, which is the reason why I feel obligated to put in my 2 cents. I usually only write reviews for over-rated or under-rated movies.....and this one is certainly under-rated. TR has it all, romance, comedy, action, and some very tense scenes and situations. The acting is top-quality, even Slater, and with such an ensemble cast it's definitely one of the movies strongest points. All of the characters are well thought out and make the film a true joy to watch. Simply seeing Oldman (probably my favorite actor) depict a Jamaican pimp who thinks he's black is an awesome sight. I don't think there's a character he can't pull off, and especially if it's someone a bit deranged and a little bit out of his mind. Another performance worth mentioning is Christopher Walken, who plays a Don for the Mafia. I won't give away his involvement but I will lead on that he has one of the coolest lines and performances I have ever seen in a long time. Dennis Hopper who plays Clarence's father in the film is in the scene with Walken and has equally witty dialog and attitude. My only problem with the movie, and it's a very minor one, is that Clarence and Alabama's romance seems a little hokey at one part, but that's it. Other than that, I love this movie!Tarantino wrote it and it's very obvious throughout most of the film. I highly recommend this movie to QT fans or anyone interested in any of the cast. Because of the acting performances, True Romance has a very high reply value.Overall 9/10.",

All I want to know is..where has she been hiding all these years? It seems that her resume is short and unimpressive. She deserves better. And just to watch James (Tony Soprano) Gandolfini do his violent thing, was worth the price of admission in itself. True Romance is miles ahead of Pulp Fiction.

            "content": "\"True Romance\" is a hopped-up, hyperkinetic action piece from Tarantino, who wrote the script.  It parallels with \"From Dusk Till Dawn\" on the violence level.  Well, Tarantino's films are known to be violent, but more in quality than abundance.  \"Pulp Fiction\" didn't have A LOT of violence.  It simply had that scene in the car where the man's head got blown off and blood splattered all over.  That shocked viewers--Well, most of them, it didn't shock me--to the extreme.  This movie has all the familiar Tarantino-ish elements--the extremely witty dialogue, the vivid character development.  The film sometimes goes over the top, with a plot that's pretty implausible and based on coincidence.  But it's handled in such a slick, intelligent style.  Therefore, it doesn't look like a poor excuse to showcase gratuitous action and violence.  Like all of Quentin's work, we get to know every single character--even the supporting ones--on a very intimate level.  He has great respect for his characters. Even if the character is going to get blown away in a few minutes, he wants us to get to know that person.  And that's his main tool in getting the audience deeply engaged in his films.  In Tarantino's eyes, there is no minutiae.  The characters will have a conversation about what they would call a Big Mac in France if it enables us to get into that someone's mind. Because that's what real people talk about.  Much like the dialogue exchange between Christian Slater and Patricia Arquette in the diner.  We get to know the two of them, through unpretentious dialogue, what kind of movies they like, what kind of music they listen to, etc.  How often do you see character development like this in an action movie?Just like \"Pulp Fiction\" and \"Jackie Brown\" there are many quotes that stick out in my mind and love reciting at my leisure.  As well as dialogue, there are many memorable characters.  Gary Oldman sticks out the most, as the ebonics-speaking pimp Drexl.  A character like that really proves Oldman's versatility as an actor.  How often will you see a sophisticated English actor take on a role like that?  He blurts out the film's most memorable quote:  \"He must've thought it was White Boy Day.\"  Christopher Walken also makes a brief, but memorable, appearance.  The dialogue between him and Dennis Hopper is intense, and it's one of the pivotal moments of the film. To watch two magnificent actors like that in the same scene is always a treat.  It's like when Robert DeNiro came face-to-face with Al Pacino in \"Heat.\"  I also enjoyed Slater's \"Elvis fetish.\"  I'm not part of the Elvis fan club, but I take enjoyment in Elvis's music and persona.  Therefore, you can expect to hear a few of The King's famous hits in the soundtrack.  The film opens with a very funny and original scene in which Slater talks to a random woman at a bar about his feelings for The King, and that he'd do as much as f**k Elvis if he had the chance.  The director is Tony Scott, so naturally the action is also emphasized.  I thought some of the action scenes were overlong and gratuitous, but they often worked.  With the film's fast pacing, there's never a dull moment, so I couldn't complain.  This is a type of movie that is so energetic, so original and so entertaining that you can't turn it down, despite its flaws. \"True Romance\" is a wild ride that keeps its foot pressed firmly on the gas. I recommend it to anyone who's a fan of Tarantino, a superb ensemble cast and basically anyone who just wants to have a damn good time.  'Cause you definitely won't be disappointed!My score:  8 (out of 10)",

He play Lee Donowitz, a corrupt Hollywood movie producer with criminal tendencies. It's tempting to speculate that the part was based on an actual person (quite possible in La La Land). Whatever the origin, Rubinek portrays the character with enormous skill - sleazy, charming, camp, vulnerable and menacing all at once. His final anguished outburst after discovering he has been betrayed is surprisingly moving and alarmingly convincing. Terrific acting. Bravo. Indeed, the movie is full of superb performances from a once-in-a-lifetime cast.",

            "content": "I refer to \"Lite\" as in a Tarantino movie with more room to breathe, where not everyone is a murderous gangster and a road movie with warmth and humour. Tarantino's screenplay absolutely bristles with electric energy.True Romance is one of my favourite films and I'm now onto the Director's Cut, that director being Tony Scott. What makes True Romance work for me is the central casting of Christian Slater and Patricia Arquette, neither obvious candidates for such; he a geeky, ever cheerful comic-book store clerk and she a kooky, but endearingly naive hooker who he 'accidentally' meets in a back-street cinema. Clarence (Slater) has quietly divine interventions with Elvis (Val Kilmer), who guides him in mirrors of washrooms, and falls head over heels with the deliciously anatomically pleasing Alabama (Arquette). They kick around, watching kungfu videos, not particularly giving much of a damn about anything. When Clarence hears of her past - and her vicious pimp (an intensely psychotic Gary Oldman, in dreadlocks) and visits him, he ends up with far more than he ever bargained for.A welcome, natural tone comes when the couple meet up with Dennis Hopper as Clarence's security guard (& ex police) father, keeping the film's feet on the ground. The setting - a solemnly industrial Detroit winter-land, contrasts with lusciously sunny madcap road trip to L.A, a suitcase of cocaine to sell to a producer 'friend' of an actor 'friend' of Clarence's, this actor thinking he has a major part in a film. Hopper gets a not particularly welcome visit from the requisite Christopher Walken, as the 'owner' of the white stuff. That is pure Tarantino and a highlight for many lovers of the film.After the two leads, my favourite is Brad Pitt as the permanently stoned slacker, friend of the actor friend of Clarence's who habitually watches TV all day and casually invites mobsters in to join him in his leisure pursuits and then tells them all they want to know, totally not thinking of the consequences for his buddies. A slimline \"Soprano\", James Gandolfini who lays in wait for Atlanta gets the fight of his life and this truly becomes suspenseful and blood-splattering violent. Meanwhile Clarence, still on 7th heaven about his marriage is getting the biggest cheeseburger ever for them both as a celebration.Black humour in abundance mocks Hollywood and its system, whilst cop Christopher Penn wires up another actor in the most awkward of places, who's been caught foul of the law when his dope literally ends up all over his face. It does get a little mad and bad and this is about the only part I think that lessens the film. A traditional shoot-it-up, bullet spraying ending leaves our couple running for their lives once again. Do they live happily ever after? This is Tarantino, not Disney, so you'll have to find out for yourself.A sublimely cool Chris Isaak song unrolls with the end credits. Overall, a very satisfying film that hits so many buttons - sharp script, black humour, sex, bloody violence, sunshine, wit, drugs, daft people, cool and clever people and a nice load of A-listers all doing spot-on roles with enthusiasm and skill.",

            "content": "After getting married Clarence (Slater) and Alabama (Arquette) run off with stolen drugs and attempt to sell it which leads a big drugs baron to chase after them Arguably Tony Scott's most violent film shows a true dynamic of criminal justice and vigour that could have only been well executed by the man in the know, Quentin Tarantino.As of its release in 1993 there was a collection of relative unknowns starring in this picture that has all gone on to be huge in Hollywood. Pitt, Kilmer, Slater, and Oldman the list is endless. For the already established stars of Hopper, Walken amongst others this was one of their crowning glories. Who can forget the \"eggplant\" scene with Hopper and Walken, a truly outstanding confrontation where passions, opinions and controversies are running riot.Slater leads reasonably well from the front being engrossed into his role of jealousy and determination for a better existence. However he is upstaged by hooker Alabama, played with a sophisticated sexiness by Patricia Arquette, a marvel who shines through and through. The character opens with a beautifully charming foreplay scene, to being incredibly distraught when involved with the crime sequences, a perfect femme fatale.Despite the stunning array of Hollywood on show this is unquestionably about the startling narrative which encodes your familiar elements of Tarantino. Drugs, business like dealings, brutal killings and no holds barred language. And though Scott does a reasonable job directing this brutal story, there are moments when you would have liked the Pulp Fiction director to pick up the camera. The final scenes in the hotel could have done with a more flinching and focused styling whilst the drug taking sequences can be too kind and sparring of the audiences.However Scott controls the necessary elements of the picture with a modest and still action orientated styling. For example the opening scenes in the bars and cinema are well managed and told with the scripting in mind and the confrontation between Hopper and Walken is certainly the best scene I've ever seen him direct.The feeling of sexual orientation being significant is often stated in his films. The constant topless shots in Top Gun and here the carefully respected sex scene would otherwise be appreciative of the moment rather than posing to get viewers.The ending in the hotel was good and quite stupid of me I had seen Enemy of the state prior to this and couldn't stop the comparisons flowing.This is a great film. Flinching ordeal of a happy life dreaming mixed so fluently with shocking illegal crime activities and with an array of stars this is simply watchable.",

            "content": "Let's face it... romance is weird. It can be sappy, it can be schmaltzy, it can be awkward, and it can be violent. For the film True Romance, we focus on the violent. The film is only written, not directed by, Quentin Tarantino, and you will not forget it. It is directed by Tony Scott, and props to him for handling a Tarantino script so substantially. True Romance is about Clarence Worley, played by Christian Slater. On a lonely night, Clarence meets Alabama Whitman (Patricia Arquette) and makes love to her that night, only to find out later that she is a call girl. It doesn't matter to Clarence, however, as he eventually goes on to marry Alabama. The films begins as a sappy romance story, but it eventually leads to being a parody of the typical boy meets girl story. The trouble begins when Clarence goes and kills Alabama's former pimp (played by the always incredible Gary Oldman) and steals 500 grand worth of cocaine from him. The two star-crossed lovers find themselves in a mess when they skip town to try to sell the cocaine in Hollywood, all the while being chased by the mobsters who want their stash back. What could have been a silly and over the top disaster of a film, becomes something absolutely awesome.True Romance is simply just fun and intense. The story is absurd and crazy, and it fits with all its hectic dialouge and nutty characters. Everything in this film works. Clarence and Alabama are the only two characters in the film that we begin and end with. The rest of the cast is a makeup of cameos, each serving their own great purpose. Gary Oldman's scene as the pimp Drexl is absolutely incredible, and Oldman proves once again that he is one of the greatest character actors of this age. Dennis Hopper appears for a couple of scenes as Clarence's father, and he masters his scenes with all his subtle excellence. In his final scene he appears with Christopher Walken, and it makes for one of the most intense and riveting scenes of the whole film. It is one that will keep you on the edge of your seat with suspense billowing over you. Other talents like Brad Pitt, James Gandolfini, and even Samuel L. Jackson for a very brief scene, give each of their scenes the full appreciation and dedication they deserve.I can't imagine what this film would have been like if it didn't have the kind of talent behind its dialouge like Quentin Tarantino. This kind of darkly comic, visceral, pulpy thriller is just what Tarantino excels at, and he turns a schmaltzy romance into a violent and drugged up thriller, that happens to be driven by a strange and very unconventional romance. Ironically, Tarantino was hardly a recognized name at this point in his career. His only credit at this point was his independent success of Reservoir Dogs (1992), that really wouldn't get the recognition it deserved until the massive success of Pulp Fiction (1994), the year after True Romance. And even though Reservoir Dogs and Pulp Fiction are, in my opinion, much better films, True Romance is not a film to be forgotten. It can definitely be considered a hidden gem.True Romance delivers everything you want. It has a great story, snappy and quick witted dialouge, a great cast of characters, and some of the most wicked and bloodiest fight scenes you'll see, especially in films with the word romance in them. The title of the film is extremely fitting, because this film no doubt displays the true meaning of romance, which is sticking by your partner through thick and thin, and not leaving their side no matter what kind of trouble they get themselves into. And Alabama is just that kind of person for Clarence. These two characters are not good people, they are ruthless and violent in every way, but they are no doubt in love. And this gives True Romance an ironic greatness that you just don't see work in all films. If you want an exciting and tons of fun experience, watch True Romance.",

Clarence and Alabama's flaws are left out in the open, but given the weird 'they live happily ever after' ending, it seems like you're meant to root for the two of them, and that connection just wasn't there for me. Like, Clarence's Elvis Presley hallucination in the first act screamed \"This guy needs serious help!\" and I kept that impression all throughout the film. Alabama didn't prove much better in this regard as the way she shrugged Clarence's violence off (the line \"I think what you did is so romantic\" made me cringe so hard) also annoyed me. As per Tarantino style, the action is highly stylized, but I found very little of it exciting. Those scenes really could've used some tightening up in terms of editing and cinematography. Even the final shootout, though interesting on paper, suffered from this to a degree. With that being said, I liked a few aspects about this film. Tarantino's writing style isn't for everyone, and while a couple scenes like the n word conversation are cringe inducing, I enjoyed most of the dialogue and felt it brought enough style to the film to keep it entertaining from beginning to end. Tarantino has a talent for writing catchy and witty scripts and this film was no exception to that. The film also lives up to another of Tarantino's strengths as it has a strong ensemble cast. Slater, Hopper, Walken, Rubinek, Rapaport, and even Arquette, though her acting occasionally annoyed me, ranged from good to great. Finally, while the story didn't interest me much, I did enjoy a few smaller scenes within the larger story, like Elliot being pulled over by a cop. Issues aside, I enjoyed my time with this film and, while I doubt I'll ever end up loving it, I might watch it again if I'm in the right mood.",

Particularily the motel room scene, involving Gandolfini and Arquette. Though it's violence is not why I have given it 3/10 . Otherwise I would be giving it a 2/10. Among the lauded performances, Oldhams is good, but not as good as some have made it out to be. Walken is menacing and interesting, but has little to do. Hopper is Hopper and nothing special.

            "content": "Tony Scott's \"True Romance\" (1994) is a cocktail mixture of action, drugs, sex and violence rollicking with the heedless enthusiasm of a newborn puppy in a Christmas box. The plot is a miasma of over-the-top situations centering on a comic store clerk and a call girl who fall in love and set about making their mark in the world. The murder of the call girl's pimp and the re-appropriation of his drug stash allow this dynamic duo to attain their dreams, but not without some bumps along the way.Scripted by Quentin Tarantino and Roger Avary, the film exists in a high-octane and bullet-riddled universe where paper-thin characters thrive with no sense of nagging morality or long term purpose. The viewer never knows what Clarence (Slater) or Alabama (Arquette) want to be, other than a mad dog killer and a gorgeous hooker, or even what they want to do, other than have sex in phone booths and watch Kung Fu movies. In fact, their long-term goal of \"getting far, far away\" throughout the film is revealed as spending money, making love and lying around on tropical beaches. Does this make the film not worth seeing? No: Quite the opposite.Once the viewer realizes he is not watching a realistic film but instead a film written for twenty-something college dorm inhabitants, the film can be enjoyed for what it is: an entertaining action movie with lots of crazy dialog, fast-paced antics and bloody situations.The two stars, Christian Slater and Patricia Arquette, are ideally cast for their roles. Slater effortlessly conveys the bored-out-of-his-mind young man who hasn't grown up and spends his time clerking at a comic book store. As the peppy hooker, Arquette's performance encapsulates the Playboy nymph of a male teendom's dreams: the breezy gal you hope would crash at your pad for a week in Daisy Duke Shorts and halter tops.The best performances in the film are by Val Kilmer, unrecognizable as the imaginary Elvis, and Brad Pitt, who bumbles along as the stoned-beyond-all-reason roommate that is all too eager to give directions. Dennis Hopper gives a mostly by-the-numbers performance with the exception of a tense yet hilarious speech delivery on Sicilian genetics. Christopher Walken instantly tops the speech and calmly egresses with his usual cool. The icing on the cake is the talented Gary Oldman as a psychotic drug-dealing wacko-path who rants about White Boy Day and is the epitome of urban mayhem.If you are bored on a Saturday night then I suggest you rent \"True Romance\" and let the chaotic genius of Tarantino Land wash over you.**** (Four) out of ***** (Five) stars",

            "content": "True Romance (1993/Tony Scott) {written by Quentin Tarantino} *** out of **** I recently purchased a boat load of Tarantino flicks, and this was one of them. Sure it wasn't directed by him, but their are still many of his trademarks (hamburgers and kung-fu films) featured in the film.\nI want to start out by saying that this film has the finest cast I have ever seen on film. It starts out as the strangest Romance I have ever seen, but quickly changes gears into a violent/action/thriller. The films starts out with a nerdy Elvis fan in Detroit named Clarence(Christian Slater) who has a one night stand with a call girl named Alabama (the very sexy Patricia Arquette). They soon decide that they love each other and get married. Then, Clarence takes it upon himself to kill Alabama's old Pimp (Gary Oldman in dreadlocks ). This is were the ultra bloody/violent fun begins, when they take it on the lam. Other players in the cast are Dennis Hopper (Clarence's father), Christopher Walken (a ruthless mobster), Brad Pitt (the ultimate stoner), Val Kilmer (Clarence's vision of Elvis), Chris Penn & Tom Sizemore (two cops), James Gandolfini (a cold-blooded hitman), and Samuel L. Jackson as a Drug-dealer (very small part). The only problem I have with the cast is that a lot of the characters either are killed off or disappear before they can develop fully. The best scene is when Walken interrogates Hopper's character. It is surreal to see such great actors in the same scene. Excellent dialogue too. I also found it strange to see Hopper in such a toned down role.Some die-hard Tarantino fans might not like the fact that it is not directed by Tarantino, but that isn't really a problem. Tony Scott ('Enemy of the State' and 'Spy Game') does a credible job directing, if not a little fast paced. But the film has that \"we've seen it all before\" feeling, especially with the blood soaked climax. All in all, a worthy effort. A must for Tarantino fans, but others rent before purchase. The DVD is excellent, and a great addition to my collection.-30-",

Instead of showing violence as absurdity, he shows it as a glamorous way of dealing with one's aggression. In fact, Scott's direction almost made me not like this film. The camera never stops and the fanatical editing is overkill. This just goes to show you that no one can direct a Tarantino script other than Tarantino himself. Old QT would have made this movie violent and funny, instead of violent and silly. The acting cannot be faulted, though. Gary Oldman, Brad Pitt and Christopher Walken are the best of the bunch. I've never cared much for Michael Rapaport, and would've much rather seen someone like Steve Buscemi play this part. And about Tom Sizemore and Chris Penn: Was I supposed to feel for these guys in the movie? I know that they're cops, but they weren't likable at all and they're introduced about three-fourth's into the film, seeming like they've come straight out of another movie. So all in all, the good things: The acting. The script. The bad things? The direction. The editing. And I'm sorry, that ending too! What cheese!",

Clarence is the core that holds the movie together and I enjoyed watching his slide from comic book nerd to full scale gun-wielding hero. Although we are witness to the descent into Hell, it never has a Straw Dogs kind of push-the-nerd-to-the-limit feel. It comes across that he is just living out his comic book fantasies for real.Patricia Arquette, full on drop your popcorn screen bomb, the scene in the phonebox has to be one of the sweetest and sexiest couple of minutes a guy could ever dream of. Ah, sweet Alabama.Christopher Walken and Dennis Hopper play what to them must be light entertainment roles. But the heart is in it (unlike many so-called cameos in movies these days) and they bring the whole thing a lovely feeling of an ensemble piece. Not forgetting the rest of the crowd, and some incredibly funny set pieces (witness the cocaine in the car, and the 'who the f**k is Dick?' sequence). This is a movie for a lonely or sad Saturday afternoon. Slap it in the DVD and sit back.The plot follows along at a very snappy pace and the conclusion, complete with the ultimate hommage to shiny guns and cigarettes (Freud, would you please like to comment? :-), leaves us content and satisfied, Heavens it almost has a touch of skewed Disney movie about it.

Jackson, Tom Sizemore and Chris Penn will. Clarence and Alabama (Slater and Arquette) are on the run across America from the police and the mobe after Clarence kills Alabama's pimp and accidentitly steals his cocain, who he plans to sell to a big time movie producer (Rubinek). The script is a wild ride that is over the top and unbelievably fun. All the performances are superb, especially Christopher Walken as one bad ass gangster. Brad Pitt also provides some memorably amusing scenes as Floyd, a stoner roommate. Tarantino's script is fill of surprises and twists at every corner. I pose a question to all of you, tell me one action movie that doesn't have romance of some sort in it. Of course you can't, all action has romance, it is a marketing sceme to appeal to a larger audience. But this is not an action movie at all, no in fact it is a romance film with the odd gun battle and fist fight, think Thelma and Louise meets Pulp Fiction. All in all a great entertaining romp that will have you laughing and biting your nails with excitement while not killing a single brain cell. Who would have thought love could be this fun?",

            "content": "Last Christmas, I had a bunch of friends over, ogling my favorite gift, a Sony DVD player and a bunch of discs. When They asked what film we should christen it with, I recommended True Romance. As I am known as a person who likes action movies, they began wondering what in the hell I was talking about and saying they did not want to watch a \"chick\" flick. Laughing, I put the disc in. Two hours later, they were applauding. Several of them begged me to watch it again and asked if I would give them my videocasette of it.The thing about this film that made it such a failure was that it is a film that requires a certain amount of confidence and allowance of violence. The film's really a love story. Real love. How often does a marriage survived based on two people knowing each other but a day. With these two characters, we do not have to worry about that. What we do have to worry about are an inebriated gangster{Walken, stealing his only scene, and he steals it from Dennis Hopper. One of the film's classic lines comes from here:I'm the Anti-christ, you tell the angels in heaven you never saw evil so singulary personified as in the face of the man who killed you}, his henchmen, a bunch of cops{played to a perfect clique{this is a complement} by Chris Penn and Tom Sizemore} who have tracked them down thanks to a traitor, and a bag full of cocaine. Of course, the real concern is whether Clarence{A movie,Elvis obsessed weirdo} and Alabama{A former prostitute and giggly blonde} can get through this. This film is a triumph for everyone involved, including Tarantino. THis screenplay, the first he ever wrote, is a very effective and entertaining one. It would not have survived or be as well praised had the original ending been intact, but that does not matter. We see Tarantino{normally agressive about doing his own material}'s world through Tony Scott's eyes. THis is Scott's smallest and greatest film. It shows how effective his directing can be. Christian Slater is phenomenal, Patricia Arquette is VERY effective, Dennis Hopper is great, Walken was amazing, and Gary Oldman gives one of his better performances as a pimp{yep, a pimp}. This is a really great movie, and one that makes you happy in the end. Although violent, it will make you walk out of it with a dopey grin on your face. IT IS A GREAT FILM.",

            "content": "I recently read Tarantino's original screenplay to \"True Romance\". Apart from the change in narrative structure (non-chronological), it hints to a bleaker, grittier urban drama, with a tragedy ending. It would be very interesting to see the final film in Tarantino's vision.Tony Scott's sugar-coated adaptation works wonders though. It was made very clear in the script that the relationship between the two leads was very strong. Scott took this unison and gave the film a fairy-tale tone. The villains in the film are very colourful, contributing to the feel that Scott has established. Hans Zimmer's score does nothing better, than to enforce this vision.The cast is one of the most impressive line-ups I've ever seen. Much of the film rests on the shoulders of Christian Slater and Patricia Arquette, both characters come off very likable with clear, clean, simple motives. These are career performances. Dennis Hopper gives good in his limited screen-time as Christian's ex-cop, ex-alcoholic father. It is in his time shared with Christopher Walken (being a one-scene wonder, like in \"Pulp Fiction\"), that he comes off at his best. The Sicilian scene is Walken's most intense since \"Deer Hunter\". Gary Oldman also gives another deliciously evil and memorable performance, the man is a chameleon, he is yet to unimpress me.But one of my favourite things about the cast is seeing then-relative-unknowns Samuel L. Jackson, Brad Pitt and James Gandolfini in small, but memorable roles. A real shame that Jackson's performance was cut down heavily from the script, some of the dialogue in his one scene was very amusing, if maybe a little offensive to some.\"True Romance\" is a brilliant crime drama, and a perfect (if phased) introduction to Tarantino's work, it is probably the most accessible film he's penned. People will always ponder over whether or not Tarantino's directorial version would have been better, but they can always rest-assure that Scott has given a wonderful adaptation, supported by a very strong cast. It could have been much, much worse. 9/10",

Kill Bill was his best film (which i would give a 9 out of a 10), reservoir dogs was good, but far from great, a 6 out of a 10, Jackie brown was bad, and finally pulp fiction, one of the most overrated films ever alongside 2001 and Seven Samurai (both of which sucked terribly). Pulp fiction wasn't bad it just wasn't very good, just because the story was chopped up doesn't make it a good one, it was uninteresting and had ZERO action, also the rape scene and the dialogue were pointless, all they said was the f word and the rape scene was just wrong, if it had more action and a better story with better dialogue it would be much better, i would give Pulp a 4 out of a 10, so as you can see Tarantino is good but needs to do a lot more to become great. Now onto this movie, just let me say that this is Scott's film so give him some credit, Tarantino wrote it, Scott made it, all the performances and style are from Scott, he is a good director capable of just as much if not more then Tarantino. Overall this was an average film, basically a chick flick with violence, drugs, and great dialogue, a highlight of the film, the dialogue was creative an hilarious, and Brad Pitt cracked me up, he played the pothead so well, in fact he was a little too good, wonder what he was doing back then. It had style, it had humor, it had decent performances, but it lacked a complex story, action, and drama. I give it a 5 out of a 10, Scott has gotten better since this and i cant wait to see Domino, as for Tarantino i hope he continues making movies just as long as he makes them more like Kill Bill, he is good but don't think of him as a god because he is far from anywhere near that status, i hope he does Inglorious Bastards he would make a great war movie, also i would like to see his new kung fu movie, sounds good.",

A lot of people have blasted Tony Roberts' direction, but he DID get these performances for this scene.  The way Walken reacts and smiles at Hopper's \"story\" is subtle and brilliant.  You can see from his reactions that his anger is increasing with each new sentence from Hopper, but he chooses to make it look as if he is amused, not letting Hopper know.  Of course Hopper DOES know, having sized up Walken as well as the situation within seconds. This is his last hurrah -- he knows he is going to die, but he is actually getting the better of Walken in doing so, and you can see it in his eyes during this scene.  Walken creates a sense of menace/impending doom while all the while being friendly and polite -- he is in my opinion the best actor in Hollywood today.

            "content": "Knowing this film was written by Tarantino, it was a no-brainer that it would be violent and rich in dialogue. It also seemed like a strange title since Tarantino has never directed a romance story, and this movie is only devoted to the titular romance at certain moments. Rather than focusing on the actual romance, this film primarily focuses on the aftermath of Clarence's decision to \"rescue\" Alabama from her pimp. What I mean by this is that the movie is driven by the fact that people are after Clarence once he steals some cocaine as well as by Clarence's sense of freedom by sitting on a fortune as long as he sells the coke. The romance is something that compliments this story.When the romance is actually given attention in the film it proves to be interesting. Clarence learns that Alabama is a prostitute who his boss had hired to show Clarence a good time on his birthday, and this makes no difference to his feelings for Alabama. She is touched that he genuinely had a good time with her - the greatest time he has had with a girl in his whole life. Sex is not the deciding factor here; Clarence loves Alabama for who she is, what she loves, her comforting presence. Perhaps this is the meaning of the title - the romance is formed regardless of the situation of how the two met. The two are together throughout the movie, but it is a shame that most of the film focuses on the crime Clarence becomes involved in rather than the dynamics of this relationship.This movie is made up of a stellar cast, and it is a shame that a good amount of recognizable names are only in the film very briefly. Though Tarantino only wrote this film we see a lot of faces found in films which he directed: Brad Pitt, Samuel L Jackson, Christopher Walken, and Chris Penn. Christian Slater as Clarence is a perfect fit for the role though he is not a well-known actor. He adds great personality to Clarence who is a true Tarantino character, defined by his taste in pop culture, as well as just a touch of craziness to make his desperation believable.Perhaps it is because this film is directed by Tony Scott and not Tarantino, but True Romance is a decent story which lacks Tarantino- level energy, especially in its action sequences. True Romance is a fun experience if you keep in mind it is a screenplay by Tarantino in his early days.3.0/4.0",

Major kudos are in order for the casting director; who featured one of the finest casts in movie history, although its standard formula in Tarantino films.

Christian Slater is dynamite in the lead role, you can tell he had a lot of fun playing his character. Val Kilmer plays \"Angelic Elvis\" who provides a small dose of good conscience on Slater's shoulder, and Patricia Arquette co-stars as the love of his life. Has all the familiar faces: Dennis Hopper, Christopher Walken, Brad Pitt, Gary Oldman, James Gandolfini, Chris Penn, Tom Sizemore, Victor Argo, among others.

Pulp Fiction is my favourite film ever and i also loved Kill Bill (1 and 2), Reservoir Dogs and Jackie Brown, so i wanted to see true romance, which Tarantino wrote the script for.To be honest i wasn't sure what to expect, as the name seems to suggest a romantic comedy of sorts, but this definitely not a chick flick. From the very beginning you can see the 'tarantino-ness' of the film, the coolness, the pop culture references, the clever, quote-able dialogue, and although it lacks the visual flair of the films he has directed, this is still top notch entertainment. The main thing that hit me was the way i felt at the end of it. You know a film is good when u are still thinking about it long after the end credits have rolled, and the thing i couldn't get out of my mind was the line 'You're so cool'. you have to see it to understand, but i'd recommend this to anybody; a clever, entertaining, iconic film that has the 'cool factor' all the way through. Who said romance was dead...",

I think , Christian Slater and Patricia Arquette are perfect in their roles and their relationship, their falling-in-love is set up very well by the script. I also totally dig this idea of really going through hell for love. And for that matter, I think the title is chosen very wisely, it's a \"True Romance\". But as the movie goes on and introduces new characters, it loses. Those police officers, Dick Richie, they were just patterns of characters, not real characters.

One hell of a good time.  \"True Romance\" is an overblown action flick that even throws in the kitchen sink and entertains like the dickens.  Most of the time, action movies bore me to tears.  Not in this case. When you're not on the floor, in stitches from the hilarious script, you will be mesmerized by the abundance of big name actors.  I swear, half of Hollywood stops by and says \"hi\" in this one. Be it Brad Pitt, Christopher Walken, James Gandolfini, Samuel L. Jackson, Val Kilmer, Chirs Penn, Bronson Pinchot, Saul Rubinek, or Michael Rappaport, you will recognize someone and be amazed that they're in it.  The list just keeps going on.  While action and fireworks normally get on my nerves, I actually liked it here.  Not because it was done with a frantic sense of style, but because I liked the characters.  Even the bad guys were fun to watch and I really cared about the two leads.  The dialog, I love, and will make you wish that Tarantino would just hurry up and get back in the game.  I SO miss his writing.  I can't imagine what this would've been if he had directed... I highly reccomend True Romance to anyone who wants a roller-coster ride of a movie and loves to hear profanity presented in a unique, inventive way so that it's actually funny.  \nI'm going all out here and giving it a 10/10.",

Christian Slater plays Clarence, an Elvis loving, Kunfu watching, comic bookstore nerd. He meets a hot blonde hooker named Alabama played by Patricia Arquette and they fall instantly in love. The film is written by Quentin Tarrantino, a former video store nerd himself, and his touch is unmistakable. The plot twists as Clarence kills Alabama's former pimp and steals his drugs causing a chain reaction of events involving the Detroit Mob and the police. It's amazing how many characters Tarrantino writes for in his films and how much depth and complexity they all have. The supporting players such as Dennis Hopper, Christopher Walken, Brad Pitt, and Chris Penn offer some of the most memorable moments in the film most notably a discussion on the origins of the Sicilians. The performances are all very solid especially Gary Oldman as the dread locked pimp, Drexl. He transforms into the character with such detail it's hard to recognize any noticeable traits of the actor on screen. So the acting is great and the script is incredible. Where could it go wrong? The direction of the film by Tony Scott for me brought the film down a few notches. The entire movie felt very claustrophobic. There were way to many close ups that had no motivation at all. In the final shootout he cuts from one close up to another of people shooting and guns. It's hard to tell who is who and where anybody is. Its action movie film-making and overdone. That scene is very similar to Tarrantino's first film Reservoir Dogs, which he directed. There is a shootout in one room where basically everyone dies. The difference is how it was shot. Tarrantino shows all the action in one static shot and it is far more effective. I still love this movie because the dialogue is so unique and the characters are so well rounded and performed so strongly. Its entertaining but I wonder what it could have been if Tarrantino also directed it.",

            "content": "Apart from being the breathtaking cinematic experience that it is, True Romance doubles as a masterclass in movie production by selecting the very finest ingredients: cracking script, mouthwatering acting talent and stylish director.Many have been quick to point out the Tarantino script and wealth of star actors but few have acknowledged the input of the film's director.  Being a fellow Brit, I can't help but feel proud to know that one of the finest thrillers of the decade was directed by Tony Scott.With this film, Scott proves he has the ability to handle wordplay as well as anyone.  If there was ever any doubt before, merely breathe in the chilling, claustrophobic atmosphere he crafted in the Hopper/Walken scene. Scott was also able to mold memorable character moments for all the other cameo players.  A feat all the more remarkable, considering the limited amount of screen time given to each actor.  Even the Tom Sizemore character lingers in the mind, despite the frantic editing each moment he's on screen.Unfortunately, I cannot acknowledge Tarantino (the director) with the same regard. His blistering screenplays all contain the trademark incisive repartee but Tarantino's directorial style caters too much to the scriptwriter.  Tarantino merely shoots the actors performing to dialogue (similar to that of a parent videotaping his child in a school play). Considering the excellence of his writing and the ability of each actor, this approach almost works but an experienced director is needed to sustain a visual momentum.  As a result of his one-dimensional approach, all three Tarantino films suffer from the occasional pocket of tedium. One example would be the Jack Rabbit Slim's scene in Pulp Fiction (an opinion also shared by the film's editor - Sally Menke). I even heard someone SNORING during my screening of Jackie Brown.  Tony Scott may have the reputation of favouring style over content, but once given a quality script, he has the ability to carry it with precision timing as well as flair which leaves you feeling like you've seen an electrifying movie as opposed to an electrifying play.This is not to disregard the fact that Tarantino has directed many classic movie moments but his forte remains behind the pen \u0096 not the megaphone.  It can be argued that out of all his screenplays, the two most entertaining movies were True Romance and From Dusk \u0091Til Dawn.  Neither of which were directed by Tarantino himself.  As True Romance has shown, once you have the very best players working in their respective fields, the result can be awesome.",

            "content": "Based upon a screenplay by Quentin Tarantino (Reservoir Dogs, Jackie Brown) and directed by Tony Scott (Top Gun, Enemy of the State) 'True Romance' follows the humorous and sometimes violent love story of young comic book store worker and Kung Fu film obsessive Clarence Worley (Christian Slater) and his wife, a former hooker named Alabama Whitman (Patricia Arquette). Through a situation involving Alabama's mean spirited pimp Drexl Spivey (Gary Oldman), the couple ends up with a big score of drugs and hit the road to LA in order to sell the drugs and to find a place to settle down. As they pursue the goal, Vincenzo Coccoti (Christopher Walken) tries to get his drugs back by using twisted mafia goon Virgil (James Gandolfini). Thrown into the mix are two cops looking to make a name for themselves (Chris Penn and Tom Sizemore), Clarence's friend Dick (Michael Rapaport) and his stoner buddy Floyd (Brad Pitt), a thickheaded Hollywood producer's agent Lee Donowitz (Saul Rubinek), and an enigmatic Elvis style mentor (Val Kilmer) and 'True Romance' is the result. The list of actors is impressive, not to mention Dennis Hopper as Clarence's ex - cop father. As the plot develops, many of these characters get more and more involved with one another until a huge shootout climax at the end involving many of these people.The screenplay by Quentin Tarantino is, as usual, heavy on scorching, quick dialogue from everyone on board. The relationship between Clarence and Alabama is wild and filled with youth and vigor as the couple constantly expresses their physical attraction with one other. In other words, they have a lot of sex. While a good sum of the characters are criminals, Tarantino opts to make them distinct. While the cops speak quickly and in bursts of spit, characters like Coccoti are given more careful, slick dialogue and sometimes even monologues (a similar example can be seen in the character Bill of 'Kill Bill: Vol. 2'). They talk in rapid fire ways with a lot of personality and a lot of gusto, and Tarantino tries his absolute hardest to make it all sound real and clever. Like in 'Reservoir Dogs', he fails. While its not alone his fault, the relationship between Clarence and Alabama seems forced rather than natural. The audience is supposed to feel their passion for one another, but instead of throwing at us something to work with Tarantino simply tries to make up for it with sex scenes. The \"realistic\" dialogue doesn't come across that way, once again not every person in the world says \"f*ck\" every second line. These characters are incredibly basic and simple, with little to no depth underneath their looks.Tony Scott, known for usually directing action type films doesn't exactly go the distance in the case of 'True Romance'. His direction follows what is on the page given to him by Tarantino, and while some of the performances are noteworthy it seems to be the case from the actors themselves instead of Scott's direction. Its a wonder how he assembled such a fine ensemble together, but he makes poor use of most of them, and such fine actors like Gary Oldman are given much smaller roles. There are some clever moments throughout the film, but nothing too noteworthy. It feels as is Scott's direction is patchy, and the violent comes of as brash and obnoxious. There are a few scenes of extremely graphic violence, but Scott seems to shove it so much in the audience's face that they turn away in disgust. It doesn't feel necessary to the story like it should. In the case of other films with high levels of bloody violence, its used to a level where it shows the means of the plot but in 'True Romance' its rubbish and it even detracts from the film.I give some credit to 'True Romance'. Its by no means a bad movie, and the cast gives some solid performances all around. Tarantino's screenplay has its moments, and the movie is definitely entertaining but Scott's abusive direction and Tarantino's trademark messy screenplay aren't enough to propel the film into something \"good\". Instead, it turns out to be mediocre.7/10",

While it caters to all the action-kinda-romance-kinda-comedy-kinda-immature movie clich\u00e9es, it still manages to put on an entertaining, and in many ways original, show. This movie is a boy's dream (of a boy, let's say, between 13 and 25) since the lead character (\"Clarence\") gets to have a job which seems to amount to reading comic books all day long, gets to meet, and win, a knockout girl who just happens to have the same interests as he (i.e. comic books, kung-fu movies, Elvis, etc), gets to drive all the way from Detroit to Los Angeles with a case full of coke (which they \"innocently\" plan to have transformed into a case full of money), all the time outsmarting criminals and policemen alike just like in....that's right!: the movies. It's clearly evident that this screenplay has been written by \"the one and only\" (you can interpret that expression in any way you like) Quentin Tarantino as the characters discuss things like Elvis's good looks and bad TV shows with the same intensity as if their lives depended on it. Almost in spite of itself, though, this movie feels original. For example, the relationship of Clarence and Alabama feels quite original, genuine and even sexy. And then there is, of course, that outstanding \"interrogation scene\" with Dennis Hopper and Christopher Walken. Clarence's father, played by Hopper, knows for sure that his last moment has come when he is captured and interrogated by the Mafia guys. He knows for certain that they are never going to let him walk. He knows that he's going to die, so he decides to keep his honor and integrity to the very last minute and tells Christopher Walken \"the story about Sicilians' ancestry\" which, of course, amounts to his very own death penalty.

This is just a few words on this great movie.Tony Scott was not an elite director, but he could and did make the odd top movie. It's possible I could direct True Romance with Tarantino's script, but either way, Scott was at the peak of his powers here.The movie contains love, mafia, drugs, great dialogue and one of the best shootouts ever put to celluloid. Perhaps what makes the movie elite is the Sicilian scene. Whilst the scene cannot be considered as 'racist' as it's praising the moors, it's just a snapshot of a time when movies were not politically correct. That will never happen again. The seventies, the eighties and the nineties were the best cinema ONLY because they weren't living by WOKE guidelines. No one was offended back then, it was just a better time.True Romance was one of the last great movies. Ten years later, things started going downhill and cinema will never recover. The film invokes my memories of wild romantic adventures of my youth. What happens in this movie DOES happen in reality and happened to me twice and I'm only 40. Christian Slater is at the peak of his acting ability in this feature. Whilst never an accomplished actor, he has a strong screen presence and he is able to dominate the screen as would a Jack Nicholson. Brad Pitt, a superb actor, basically plays himself as a stoner, whilst Bronson Pinchot, Tom Sizemore, Chris Penn, James Gandolfini, Chris Walken, Dennis Hopper, Val Kilmer, Patricia Arquette, Michael Rappaport, Saul Rubinek give career best performances in supporting roles.

Whenever I meet a fan of the cinema and we start discussing what we consider to be \"the greats\" I get excited, hell I get jittery when I learn that this person HASN'T seen True Romance. Why? Because I remember what it was like viewing this movie for the first time, expecting nothing, yet being totally in awe while watching True Romance for the first time. I get excited because I know that when I insist that THIS be the next movie this person watches, they too will soon be enlightened.While Tarantino should receive credit for knocking out an incredibly original screenplay, it's the cast that makes this movie so special. No one tries to steal the show. No one tries to make it \"their\" movie. Believe it or not, there are times in Hollywood when an ensemble cast so special is assembled that the end result truly is magic. This is one of those times.The big scene, of course, occurs between Dennis Hopper and Christopher Walken. A scene that True Romance is known for.

            "content": "Like much of Quentin Tarantino's catalogue, the final result is just a tad heartless. There's passion, there's ingenuity (in the dialogues) but nothing tangible in terms of raw emotion. I don't buy in to this titular romance, because it's all rather haphazard. The film gives you maybe one scene to really try and grasp how utterly two people can fall for each other, but I don't think it's enough. Christian Slater is one of my favourite actors and Patricia Arquette is awesome, but unfortunately, they do not sell it. It's a movie loaded with moments and great quotes, however. Dennis Hopper and Christopher Walken's 11 minute interaction remains one of the best in all of cinema, and Gary Oldman is seriously impressive as the psychotic Drexel - But pair that with the middle of the film, where we really slow down to a bit of a slog. Nothing is compelling there, even with the desperate presence of a roller-coaster. Moments, yes... Martin Scorsese, for the sake of argument, is a \"moment maestro\", but he almost always delivers on the touchy-feely stuff as well. For all it's energy, I don't think True Romance is quite the \"trip\" many will have you believe. There's gold but no platinum.",

Theres also alot of supporting roles with Tom Sizemore and Chris Penn and even a small part with Sameul L. Jackson. There is tons of violence and also a very good climatic ending. Directed by Tony Scott (Top Gun)and written by Quentin Tarantino (Pulp Fiction) they both show some of there styles such as Scott's great action sequences and Tarantino's great dialouge. 5/5 starsRated R for Strong Violence, Pervasive Langauge,Drug use, and Brief Nudity",

Not necessarily everybody knows that he wrote it too. It is so brilliant and The story is so original. Im not saying that Pulp Fiction and Reservoir Dogs aren't, but think about all the genres that are rolled into one here. Theres love, comedy, drama, violence, crime, mafia, drugs, hollywood, and the list goes on and on. I think that it may be one of the top 5-10 best screenplays ever written. Also, aside from the writing, the casting is superb. I mean we have Christian Slater (his best role), Patricia Arquette, Dennis Hopper, Christopher Walken, Gary Oldman, Samuel Jackson, Tom Sizemore, Val Kilmer, Brad Pitt, James Gandolfini (the role that pretty much had Tony Soprano written all over it) and other great actors. When you put a lot of marquis actors in a movie, it doesnt always work out because sometimes its just too much, but in this movie, their appearances in the movie are all balanced out that it works. I mean Christopher Walken is only in the movie for about 10 minutes and in that 10 minutes, he has the most memorable scene in the movie. Same goes for Gary Oldman. Tony Scott's directing is also remarkable. All in all, if you haven't seen this movie in a while or havent at all, rent it, buy it, order it, or whatever means of movie purchase you are accostomed to, and enjoy it because i think that it is a true classic. You literally will laugh, cry, and cringe, but most importantly, you will be satisfied......10/10.",

I don't watch so much action but this, i have to admit, is pretty darn good! If I could write like Tarantino I would not be working as a video store clerk. (Trivia: Tarantino was a video store clerk himself before hitting big with scripts like \"Natural Born Killers\" and \"True Romance\"!) Maybe someday I'll be credited on the covers of films instead of renting them...The story starts from the point when Clarence (Christian Slater) marries a hooker Alabama Whitman (beautiful Patricia Arquette). The couple get swirled into the cruel world of drugs as the two of them ran off with Alabama's pimp cocaine case. Soon they have the mafia after them...The movie includes some of the best supporting role characters who are created by the genius mind of Tarantino. Brad Pitt makes a memorable appearance as a happy stoner Floyd. As memorable character is the pimp played by super-talented Gary Oldman. And of course Samuel L. Jackson makes a short appearance in the film. Nevertheless my favorite character is stone cold mafia boss Vincenzo Coccotti (raw Christopher Walken).Smoky-voiced Chris Isaak's theme song \"Two Hearts\" ends the love story in great way!

I am not a Christian Slater fan, i feel that he can not carry a movie on his own, but because of the superb cast...he doesn't need to.  Even though many of the bigger name stars have roles that are really just cameos (Gary Oldman, Dennis Hopper, Christopher Walken, Tom Sizemore), the film still has a massive entertainment value.  My only wish was that Tarantino himself could have helmed the film (But being that it was his first script, and at the time he hadn't directed a film, I understand.)  Tony Scott can do action, perfect examples are the Last Boyscout (a genre classic), Enemy of the State, and Crimson Tide.This film also has some newcomers that will later become freakin' HUGE! Brad Pitt (in one his finer performances in my opinion).  And Samuel L Jackson (SHAFT himself).  But one person that I just can't see how he got in this movie but turned a good performance was Bronson Pinchot (Balki from \"Perfect Strangers\"(TV)). I can imagine the studio meeting on that one...let's get a lovable TV star and make him a foul mouthed naive coke-head!? Inspired casting indeed.  If you watch Tarantino's film in order (1) True Romance, (2)Reservoir Dogs, (3) Pulp Fiction, (4)Jackie Brown, (5) Kill Bill vol. 1.  You can see that True Romance isn't stylistically the same due to direction, but you can see the evolution of the poet that is Tarantino.10/10!",

Granted, the script was written by Tarrantino, and used a few people that would eventually wind up in his films, but the look and feel of this movie is very reminiscent of a Quentin film. Brad Pitt, back when he was still a good actor, nails the pot smoking, looser roommate. Christian Slater and Patricia Arquette make a good couple, although flawed in their life choices at times. But that makes for great cinema. The one thing that can kill or make a movie is a large cast. If the formula is followed to closely, the movie will seem like endless bit parts taped together out of order. If done properly, the movie seamlessly intertwines the lives of unrelated characters, bringing them together in ways they would normally never experience. This is True Romance. A series of events brings together a long cast of great characters and stories. In the end, you will be happy and sad for the ones that made it, and the ones that didn't.This is one of those films with characters that aren't necessarily good or bad, but shades of both at times.

            "content": "ONE GOOD THING: Quentin Tarantino's script is so vastly rich in its menagerie of characters and settings, that it becomes virtually epic in its scope. Gary Oldman's pimp, Brad Pitt's stoner, Samuel L. Jackson's drug dealer, Michael Rapaport's actor, and James Gandolfini's mob henchman are just a few of the \"minor characters\" who show up to steal the movie from its stars.ANOTHER GOOD THING: Although many feel this film would have been better if directed by Tarantino, I would disagree. This film falls ideally on the Tony Scott directorial time line, somewhere between his glossy, almost over-polished earlier works (Top Gun and Days Of Thunder) and his rapid/frenetically edited later films (Domino and Man On Fire). Scott did, unfortunately, change the movie's original time structure, which was closer to Tarantino's Pulp Fiction and Reservoir Dogs; but that appears to be a reflection of \"Hollywood Money's\" readiness to accept change, more than Scott's eagerness to meddle.EVEN ANOTHER GOOD THING: Howard Hawks once theorized that a good movie featured three good scenes and no bad ones. This film features, possibly, the greatest scene in modern movie history without a hero narrowly out running a fire ball, nuclear explosion, or ELECTRICITY!!! By placing Cristopher Walken and Dennis Hopper in a smokey house-trailer with Tarantino's dialogue, Tony Scott crafted the most watchable conversation in recent movie memory.ONE BAD THING: Time has not been kind to the film's two lead stars (Slater and Arquette), who have now been reduced to primarily television actors. This, unfortunately, gives perspective viewers/renters/buyers the wrong impression of the movie and it's superior quality level.OVERALL GRADE: A+",

            "content": "Tony Scott has made his most interesting and linear vision of romance, directing this film. In fact, 'True Romance' is almost a unique film, as it combines romance with action and drama, and it does it so well. Few are the films that have succeeded in doing this. The film centers in the dangerous and risky romance of Clarence (Slater) and Alabama (Arquette), as they fight against drug dealers, mafia thugs, cops and pimps.Spoilers:It all begins with a present from Clarence's boss, which consists in spending a lovely and sexual-appetizer night, with a prostitute named Alabama. Little did he know, that she has a problem that makes her like only one man, and immediately falls in love with Clarence. With the relationship moving forward, they face many problems. Clarence has to wipe-out Alabama's pimp, Drexl (Gary Oldman), in a superb cameo performance, which only brings more problems, as they steal Drexl's drugs (without knowing of course! They're not drug addicts, as far as I know). Drugs, which had the mafia as its destination. They then try to sell it, so they can make some money, bu little did they know, that the final showdown they would be involved in, would be one of the most violent endings of the movie industry. (You would expect no less, when we're in the presence of a Tarantino story).End of SpoilersThe plot is pretty straight-forward, with no complex stuff, just plain simple and good. It is funny, violent, dizzy and sexy. Slater's performance is just enough for his role, and I thought Patricia Arquette was lovely and at the same time innocent and sexy. The rest of the cast is almost cameo performances, Val Kilmer portrays Clarence's inspiration (Elvis), Dennis Hopper (best performance of the lot) stars as Clarence's dad, James Gandolfini also makes a vintage performance. Brad Pitt stars as a drug addict (pretty funny guy), and another superb performance by Christopher Walken. In fact, the most fantastic scene in terms of acting was the part between Walken vs Hopper. True acting that part, and the music that supported it, made it more marking.Overall, I truly recommend 'True Romance'. Watch out for the ending, it is a beauty in terms of realistic violence. Maybe this film will stay on your mind, maybe it won't, but one thing's for sure, it will surely make you love even more your wife/girlfriend.PsIKiLL's Rating: 9/10",

In my opinion, its an adult romantic comedy because of the obvious story of love.Its a story of a young couple who accidentally get a suitcase of cocaine which they then attempt to sell but it has many obstacles.It is one of tarantinos most autobiographical films in the context of, Clarence is heavily into comic books, he works in a comic book shop which is similar to the video shop Tarantino worked at when he was younger, Clarence has a boss called Lance like Tarantino did and Clarence likes to go to the cinema every birthday like Tarantino did. As Clarence is presented as a cool and sharp guy perhaps when Tarantino was writing the script he saw Clarence as the cool person he wanted to be? Tony Scott did a brilliant job directing the film, although he changed the ending, he did a very good job. The star studded cast gives the film a very enjoyable and entertaining element. Of course the cameo of Samuel .l. Jackson will make everyone laugh.In conclusion, this is a film anyone would like and its slightly under-rated in my opinion. So when you watch sit back and enjoy.",

Likable central characters, over the top 'ultra' violence, dark humour, memorable quotes, poetic monologues, surrealism and above all else, incredible performances from a cast with an immense array of talent. The script, which was originally a 500 page screenplay that was reportedly a hybrid of Natural Born Killers and True Romance, is Tarantino at his very best. The execution is even better. The film is a 2 hour whirlwind that never settles, keeps throwing plot twists at you and most importantly, never takes itself too seriously. The supporting cast are the force that drives this movie and the protagonists (Slater and Arquette) are completely lovable. Their 'love at first sight' storyline is completely absurd but in a strange way believable. You really buy into their relationship and want to see their romance blossom. As for set pieces, the confrontation between Hopper and Walken is just phenomenal. I won't give too much away but it's clear that Tarantino has always had a strange, sometimes disturbing obsession with the word 'nigger'. The delivery of both Hopper and Walken's dialogues is a an absolute masterclass. We also see Gary Oldman showing exactly why he is one of the best actors of the past 2 decades. Casting him as a dread-locked rasta is both surprising and stunning in equal measure. He is, as always, completely believable. Comparing his performance in this with say, The Dark Knight Rises (which is a very understated and underrated performance) shows this actors amazing range of diversity. I have to admit, I thought his part was slightly underwritten. Add to that Val Kilmer playing 'The King', Chris Penn playing a cop, a pre-sopranos Gandolfini as a hit-man, Brad Pitt as a mindless stoner and you have one of the greatest casts assembled in recent years. With some brilliantly ad-libbed scenes, industry 'in-jokes' and a thrilling climax, this is a must see piece of perfection.",

The supporting characters were great and there were a lot of big names in there, most notably the great James Gandolfini. But inevitably there will be some bad elements.\nThe pacing was a bit off. I think the pacing was off because at first it was going to be directed by Tarantino. It wasn't going to be in chronological order, but when Tony Scott took over that changed. The ending was too feel good for me. Apparently there was a darker ending, which would have fit the story better imo.\nFin...",

This is the type of film that needed to be seen in a non-linear look (ala Reservoir Dogs), in order to get its full understanding.Not to bang on Scott's shot.....It's kind of mixed for me. I love Tarantino's awesome storytelling techniques, but I also Love Tony Scott's action-esque directing. If both had been mixed, this movie could have been so much more.Now don't get me wrong on this: This is by far one of my top 20 favorite movies of all-time, but it seemed a bit too run-of-the-mill in direction. But all its flaws are healed by an amazing script, and it's so farfetched that it's fun to watch.It's good to see a movie once in a while that says \"Screw oscar winning titles, and give me a movie the action fan dreams of\". This movie was great, and I really enjoyed it, but not a latch-on title like Tarantino's masterpiece, Pulp Fiction.\nBy the way, I saw this movie on its 1997 DVD release. I'm currently in the looking for True Romance's Special 2-Disc Edition, and if the extras are good, this may be a movie I'll be talking about for a LOOOONG time.\nOverall: **** out of *****",

            "content": "True Romance is a very famous film which benefits from possibly the greatest cast there has ever been, almost every single role is played by a well known actor, even some of the extras. The cast is lead by Christian Slater and Patricia Arquette who aren't the biggest names True Romance has to offer, but do a fantastic job here in probably the biggest and best film they have been in. Clarence (Slater) and Alabama (Arquette) immediately have the care of the audience as they have a love that's so pure that are prepared to kill in order to protect one another.It is clear that Tarantino wrote this, as many scenes are very violent, brutal and uncompromising. The scene between James Gandolfini and Arquette really highlights this due to the shock factor of violence towards a woman and then her bloody revenge. The contrast of the characters in this scene makes it incredible to watch, he is deadly calm whilst she is borderline hysterical.The 'Tarantino Dream Scene', as I like to call it, is a conversation between veterans Christopher Walken and Dennis Hopper. It is an essential scene as it tells the audience and Hopper's character that Clarence and Alabama are in more trouble than they could have ever imagined. The dialogue in this scene is very clever and gives Walken and Hopper a real chance to show their charisma.In order to prevent the audience becoming bored by the violence, there are some comedic characters thrown in the equation which do wonders to lighten the mood and increase the enjoyment level of the film. The best example is Brad Pitt as Floyd, the permanently stoned room mate who constantly gives away the position of the lead characters.Tony Scott is not the greatest director of all time but considering the screenplay, he couldn't go far wrong. I believe he was a better choice than Tarantino for this film however, as he changed the original ending which Tarantino wrote. Tarantino has a stubborn desire to make films 'non-Hollywood' which would have ruined this film.Entertaining, touching and funny, this is one of the films of the 90s.",

The story was okay, but not as good as the others Tarantino wrote, such as Pulp Fiction and Reservoir Dogs. I think the movie might have been better if Tarantino had directed it himself, but this is still a good movie and fun to watch. What makes it so fun to watch isn't the story, but certain scenes, like when Alabama's getting beat up but she just smiles and flips the guy off. Or any of the scenes with Brad Pitt, when he's high and acting like a moron. My favorite scene is when Dennis Hopper is being interrogated by Chris Walken and he's just making a fool of the guy, knowing, but not caring, that he's about to get killed for it. One thing I don't like about this film, however, is the ending; Clarence was originally supposed to stay dead, but they changed it in the movie so that he ends up living after all, and that ruins the ending of the movie. The casting and acting are excellent, however, and Dennis Hopper and Chris Walken were both a bonus to have in the movie. I recommend this movie to anyone who is a fan of either of those actors and to anyone who likes cool movies. Four stars out of five.",

This is the film that showed me the difference between gloss and substance.  I remember seeing this film at the age of 15 and from that point on I was hooked.  I rented it several times before finding a used copy for sale.  I have recently purchased the special edition DVD, and I am again hooked.There are some films that people claim to have seen 100 times.  Well, I have more of a life than that.  I have seen more films than most people.  It is only a few select that I have seen more than once or twice.  \"True Romance\" on the other hand I have seen enough to recite every line at will, whenever and wherever.  I can visualize it frame by frame. Before most people were getting to know Quentin with Pulp Fiction, and the post PF re-urge of interest in Reservoir Dogs, I was spouting out Tarrentino dialogue with my friends from True Romance.  My favorite lines being \"You know what we have here?  A m----- f----- Charlie Bronson. Mr Majestik.\" , \"Do I look like a blonde with big t--s and an a-- that tastes like French Vanilla ice dream?\" and \"I knew something must be rotten in Denmark.  I mean, I can't tell you how relieved I was when you took off your clothes, you didn't have a d---.\"That's not to mention what I consider to be the single best piece of dialogue and cinematography in film history, (The scene between Christopher Walken and Dennis Hopper).  That scene includes my all time \"Badass\" comment of all time.  \"I'm the anti-christ.  You got me in a vendetta kind of mood. Tell the angels in heaven, you've never seen evil so singularly  personified as you did in the face of the man who killed you.\"The cast is tremendous.  The characters are all stand outs.  The performances are brilliant.  The dialogue is realistic and intelligent.  The cinematography is breath taking to recognizable.  The directing job is flawless.  \"True Romance\"  all in all is the only film, in which I have been 100% satisfied with the production.  If ever a perfect film were made other than Citizen Kane, it was True Romance.  (For all you CK fans I am not comparing the two or lumping them in.  I am simply making a statement.) True Romance:  \"10 crows out of 10 killed.  Then I reloaded and looked for another one.  He died as well.  Making this my only 11 out of 10.  Because you see I shot to of the crows with one bullet.  I killed the 11th with the 10th round.\"",

The dialogue, characters, the setting and the pure joy of movie-making are the workings of a young film-buff who cried to the heavens and years later received it's call. Mind you, I wouldn't want to meet those characters on the street, but I'm very grateful to Mr. QT and Tony Scott for creating them in this bizarre modern fairytale, that's if anything of the above also the best proof that love for any medium can create something very unique.And as the sun sets slowly in the west, I doubt that anything will ever have such a tremendous impact on my life as a filmgoer as this (sick, depraved, obscene etc. etc. movie ;-) had.",

I'm always amazed at the number of film fans I know who have never even heard of it! Tarentino did not direct this, but he wrote it.It has almost as much (or as much) violence as Pulp Fiction, so if you hate Pulp Fiction maybe you wouldn't like this film either -- but otherwise it's AWESOME...! Gary Oldman, Dennis Hopper, Christopher Walken, Patricia Arquette, Christian Slater and many others in this star-studded cast were excellent in their roles. This is most of all a FUN movie to watch. Brad Pitt's role is amazingly small -- and even more delightfully funny. I've watched this film at least 10 times and he cracks me up every time.I really can't write a good enough review for this film. It is something you really must see for yourself.

I love how Christian Slater was put in the leading role - I don't think I could imagine anyone else with so much energy and charisma. Its also refreshing to see him in a leading role as he is usually a supporting character.And as for the supporting cast - so many amazing cinematic achievements in one film! Christopher Walken is scarier than I've seen him for like, well, ever! Dennis Hopper's last speech is actually beautiful. Val Kilmer pops up there somewhere too - but I'm not spoiling that for you. And just what was Brad Pitt thinking? Obviously he was still in his Kalifornia role when he signed up for the ride. Enjoy my 4th favorite film of all time",

The triple feature that Clarence goes to (the Sonny Chiba films; Sonny plays a prominent role in Kill Bill, as Hattori Honso), the Samuel Jackson character (a brief but brilliant sign of things to come in Pulp Fiction), and the way Tarantino includes various cameos and short scenes that seem to lift already popular actors to an even higher plateau are just a few things I love about this film. Did you know that James Gandolfini's scene in the hotel room with Patricia Arquette is the defining scene that secured his being cast as Tony Soprano? Gary Oldman shows how versatile he is by playing a well disguised white pimp with amazing dialogue; the scene between Christopher Walken and Dennis Hopper is (in my opinion) one of the greatest ever filmed. The Director's Cut version of this movie has a slightly different ending to the shootout; subtle, but strangely powerful.

There are also a number of what I would say 'classic scenes. Two of them being the brutal beating of Alabama in the motel room, which shows an effective use for a toilet seat. And probeably best of all where Dennis Hopper gives his history lesson to Christopher Walkens mob leader about the origin of the Sicilian blood line, concerning a lot of bed hopping involving black people. This scene is both intense and funny, which will keep you giggling on the edge of your seat.Overall, this films deserves to be seen by anyone who likes their films funny, and very violent. try to see it in widescreen if you can, and hopefully the directors cut, which has a lot more of the violence in it.

Other actors include Christopher Walken, Brad Pitt, Patricia Arquette, Gary Oldman, Dennis Hopper, and too many others to mention. In layman's terms Christian Slater plays Clarence a comic book store clerk who is down on his luck.  He meets Alabama (a hooker, unbeknownst to him) and falls in love.  When Clarence tries to make an innocent woman out of her, all hell breaks loose.  Murder, drug deals, and more murder take place. Somehow Quentin (the screen writer... he does not direct this film) is able to pull this off while making us (at least me) laugh the entire time.Like other Quentin flicks this movie is not for the weak stomached.

Threads of romantism weave the fabric of this crime epic filled with some of the most quotable dialouges and monolouges since they added sound to film. \nPlot: Cupid shoots an arrow in Detroit and sends a pair of young lovers to L.A. to make an early withdrawal from their newly found retirement fund. Then Quentin happens.Risa Bramon Garcia & Billy Hopkins should be given Academy Awards. To assemble a cast which fits the script like a hand in glove. Slater plays our 'Hero' a comic book store employee who wills confidence backed by Elvis, his conjured 'Jimeny Cricket'. Patricia is our heroine with subtle glances, giggles and moxy that can beat a man to a pulp in ten minutes. Besides Christian and Patricia the rest of the cast is given very select supporting roles, with sometimes as little airtime as one scene. Regardless, every performance is truly memorable, whether it be Oldman as a Pimp City Wigga, or Walken as a ruthless Sicilian. Sizemore and Penn work magic together as Narcotics officers looking for the collar. Pinchot as the manic drama intern caught in the middle of the fiasco. Gandolfini as a ruthless thug who doesn't hold back when it comes to beating a woman. You really can not find a bad performance in this film. Truly this is the case when the script moves the cast and vise versa. Tony Scott should not be ignored either, of 'Top Gun' status and forefather of post modern 'Hollywood' action flicks. He wagered against Hollywood odds by keeping as close to the script as possible. The steel drums on the sound track are placed so accurately it reminds the audience the title involves 'Romance'. The only problem I could have with this movie is the fact that it's filmed in chronological order unlike the script which segments the beginning in to the middle.Bottom Line: A Must See! On my Top 5 List. This is a volitale movie, it combines scenes of simple social interaction with grave violence, you feel comforted and horrified at the same time.

The chemistry between Patricia Arquette and Christian Slater is top notch. Gary Oldman is brilliant as usual in his role as a pimp. Brad Pitt is equally brilliant in one of his first roles as a stoner dude. And the #1 reason to see this film. Christopher Walken plays a mob boss. He is on screen for about 10 minutes. He has one of the best dialouges with Dennis Hopper that I have ever seen in film history. This movie is worth seeing just for the 10 minutes Christopher Walken and Dennis Hopper are on screen together.If you like the other QT movies (PULP FICTION and RESERVOIR DOGS), you will absolutely love this film. Tony Scott (DAYS OF THUNDER, TOP GUN, THE FAN) pulls all the shots out behind the camera. I would recommend the Special Edition DVD, which has the very bizarre alternate ending.Rating: 8 out of 10",

This episode alone is one of the highlights of cinema history, period; right up there with Rutger Hauers last dying moments in \"Blade Runner\" or Robert De Niro's you-talking-to-me-speech in \"Taxi Driver\". Hell, I could go on and on praising the acting and utilizing the momentum in this scene.One of my best friends likes to say the film is just a poor sketch off Tarantino's scrapbook and only shines momentarily. I think he needs re-programming, to be honest. Sure, it's got kitschy bits (Alabama's clothes, anyone? Theme music, anyone?), sure the script has a feeling of let's get drunk and write something FUN, and sure it goes off the wall more than once.

Having said that, it still remains one of the few films that i could watch at least once a week forever.Listening to QTs commentary on the 2 disc set, and the problems he had getting the film off the ground,it seems inconceivable that this film very nearly slipped away.Every time i watch this film, i always wish that i hadn't seen it and that this was the first time!! I rate it that highly.The razor sharp, snappy trademark QT dialogue, the music, the characters and the attention given to establish each one,the intricate build up to the final Mexican stand off,the music, even the ending(and here you have a choice!)Just reading the list of actors involved, Hopper,Jackson, Walken,Pitt, Kilmer, Slater,Arquette,(yeah, cistern lids don't break when you belt someone over the head with them! )Sizemore, Penn (sadly missed),etc says quality. And this,a first screen play?? A hidden gem, a cult movie?Shout it from the rooftops, this film is that good, and the whole world needs to know. It would be perfect if the deleted scenes could be inserted into their true position.This film never got the credit it deserved and still remains a classic amongst film goers who know their stuff. I only wish that this had been QTs first girlfriend,the one that he married!",

Christian Slater gives the best performance of his career as Clarence Worley, and PATRICIA ARQUETTE is just as good as Alabama Worley.

JACKSON, MICHAEL RAPAPORT, SAUL RUBINEK, TOM SIZEMORE and CHRIS PENN one of my favourite actors. This film has some amazing scenes and some fantastic dialogue which is what you would expect from a writer like Tarantino. The final shootout in the hotel is brilliantly done with plenty of suspense.

            "content": "True Romance (1993)- 4.5/5 Possible Spoilers.One more impressive outing from the writing of Quentin Tarantino and a long list of credible actors. The dialog and performances really make the film entertaining and engaging. The storyline involves movie geek Clarence Worley (Slater) who meets a hooker named Alabama (Arquette) and falls in love with her. Clarence has trouble with her pimp, Drexl (Oldman), but ends up killing him after a fight. Instead of picking up Alabama's belongings at Drexl's apartment, Clarence picks up a briefcase filled with half a million dollars worth of cocaine by accident. The two plan to travel to Los Angeles to sell all of it and move away with the money, but a group of mobsters and the LAPD are both informed on the situation and try to reclaim it. Slater, who I don't particularly care for, does his best here and I was not let down with his performance. Tarantino's script is just great - using far more talk rather than violence to make the movie work. The cameos and supporting cast do very well in their roles, most notably Walken and Pitt. Tony Scott's direction is pretty impressive, as he provides us with a film far superior than the list of mediocre flicks the director has made. Maybe not one of the top films from the year, but definitely enjoyable and the best movie by Tony Scott.Cast: Christian Slater, Patricia Arquette, Dennis Hopper, Michael Rapaport, Gary Oldman, Bronson Pinchot, Brad Pitt, Christopher Walken, Saul Rubinek, Val Kilmer, Chris Penn, Tom Sizemore, James Gandolfini, Samuel L.

Not to put down the others, but doesn't anyone disagree that that scene is their favorite one? My favorite quote:\"...it's better to have a gun and not need it, than to need a gun and not have it\". It rides along with that old boy scout motto: always be prepared, but Clarence's way has more lettering, and funnier. You forget that it's a romance until the ending, otherwise people focus on the violence and the profanity. Ridley Scott did a good job of handling Quentin's script (no comment on Oliver Stone's butchering of Natural Born Killers), but I want to see more of QT's direction, (and less of his acting). He'll use that disgusting \"N\" word, and we'll call him a genius, and I'll be venturing out to view his latest,\"Kill Bill\".",

The plot is so over-the-top and incredible that it doesn't need to develop itself; it already developed itself from the get-go. But as it develops itself, you find yourself thinking that your next guesses to what might happen will indeed happen. What's is grand is that the unexpected pops out of nowhere, and gives you a moment of joy. You realized what you just watched was not something to be analyzed for how well it was done, but how well it struck you.

Both films are capable of being lumped together under the \"road movie\" subgenre of the crime film, so it's not too inconceivable that Tarantino and Scott had Bad Lands on their minds while making Romance.  Both films open and close with a voice-over by the female lead and in both voice-overs, the character establishes herself initially as a rather inexperienced person, one who didn't expect to be involved in the action to follow.  In Badlands, Kit murders Holly's father and thus begins their crime spree; in Romance, Clarence kills Drexel, the closest thing to a father-figure that Alabama has and likewise makes it necessary for the couple to run from the law.  Also, the two films' incidental music is too similar to be a coincidence.",

Perhaps there's so much blood and violence to divert the viewer from the lack of content. The main characters seem to know this because whenever there's a break in bloodshed they start making out.

Pulp Fiction has originality coming out the wazoo, but in the end I think being entertained is most important, and True Romance delivers.  I don't know how this movie got made in Hollywood, since the first ten pages of the script are slow and nothing incredibly interesting happens in them (not that I'm bashing it, but usually you have to start with a bang to get anyone to read the rest of your script, so I've heard).  Tony Scott is the right director for this, too.  He has an eye for these things.  What the movie is really great at is giving you memorable characters without any traditional development time at all.  This is due in large part to the tremendous acting.  This is like a big ensemble movie - without the ensemble ever occuring.  Also great is the dialogue, and if you share anything in common with Tarantino, you'll love all the references he throws in to movies, comics, television, etc.  Is it just me or was that producer supposed to be a jab at Arnold Koppelson?  They look similar, and if you replaced \"Brought Home in a Bodybag\" with \"Platoon\" it fits perfectly with what people said about Platoon.  \"After Apocalypse Now, the greatest Vietnam war movie ever made.\"  \"When veterans of that bull$hit war say [good things] about my movie, it makes the whole thing worthwhile\"  etc. Definitely check this movie out if you haven't already!

Based on Quentin Tarantino's fresh script loosely influenced by Terence Malik's Badlands, referenced by Hans Zimmers similar score for the soundtrack. Directing duties passed on to competent visual action director Tony Scott after the success of Tarantino's debut Reservoir Dogs.To be honest I don't think the film could be in better hands than Tony Scott's... His style, visual flair and balls out frenetic action gives Tarantino's pitch perfect script the care and attention the lover's on the run, action thriller truly deserves. Scott has been quoted as acknowledging True Romance as his favourite piece of work as well as recently screening an anniversary showing of his own personal copy of the masterpiece. I only wish I had been there for that experience.The story ignites with two social misfits Alabama Whitman (Patricia Arquette) & Clarence Worley (Christian Slater) meeting at the movie theatre in Detroit where they quickly begin a whirlwind romance. However, Alabama's past comes into the fray and all hell breaks loose as the couple abscond with a suitcase full of trouble, with the mob and police in hot pursuit resulting in a spectacular orgy of ultra violence and punchy dialogue.The calibre of cast in this movie is outstanding all at the top of their game with some note worthy stand out performances such as newcomer Brad Pitt in a perfectly suited stoner role...

            "content": "The spirit of Elvis inspires comic-bookstore employee Clarence (Christian Slater) to do great things. Or is it his sudden love for wild-girl Alabama (Patricia Arquette, who did a mini-run of playing women who fell only for comic-book/movie geeks with more guts than attention to detail; see the film Ed Wood, from the following year) that makes him stand up to possessive pimps, and skip to Hollywood to sell stolen cocaine? Clarence's charisma seems at first a bit implausible; his adeptness at surviving lethal situations would better suit a guy who has stolen drugs and call-girl from gangsters every other day. But Clarence is that much more charming as we realize he is simply unleashing the superman who has been waiting inside him for just such a chance to battle his way past anything that wants to spill his entrails. Clarence and Alabama are too likable for a viewer to want them any other way; the more they run from impending torture and death and gangster smart-aleckiness as only Tarantino can write such stuff, the more it seems like just a trick to lure various creeps into their clutches. The lowlifes never quite see what hits them--if Clarence and Alabama are good at one thing, it's being underestimated. Sometimes this even compensates for Clarence constantly leaving a trail that Wrongway Feldman could follow.One of the best scenes involves a cadre of gunsels, led by Christopher Walken, getting led to Clarence's father, played Dennis Hopper, thanks to Clarence's carelessness. The gangsters want the father to lead them to the son and his new girl. Walken using scare tactics on Dennis Hopper--I mean, you could flip the roles around and have just as terrific a scene...and heck, it takes a Walken to scare a Hopper. Anyway, once that bit of ugly words and deeds comes to its conclusion, James Gandolfini gets sent off on his own to get the cocaine and bury our brave couple. Full marks to a superb Gandolfini, who corners Alabama/Patricia Arquette while Clarence is off in some washroom reading a book--ack!, no wait, he's off getting munchies. Now, ahem, James Gandolfini versus Patricia Arquette seems more of an easy bet than sorting out odds on Walken versus Hopper. That said, the scene contains a few surprises, and where it looked as if any later scene involving Clarence selling a monster bag of coke to a sleazy movie producer would be minus an Alabama, our wild, plucky heroine with the cocaine shows her hidden side too.Tony Scott would later riff on his own finale to this movie by essentially borrowing it for another fun movie, Enemy Of The State, but both versions demonstrate that the bigger the crowd present for a drug buy (at least in the case of True Romance), the more rewarding for anyone who gets to watch it from a safe vantage point. The kitchen sink is not present for the final stand-off, but everyone else with a gun and an ego shows up. Perhaps Clarence and Alabama's dreams of flying to some tropical paradise with a couple hundred grand have finally led to a situation they can't charm their way out of: conflagration incarnate.This is a cool, slick crime movie starring a loving couple who, though they are doing bad things to get their own slice of the pie, are not doing unspeakably horrendous things for more than their slice, while enjoying some nasty slicing. This separates our lovable anti- heroes from most of the other characters, and gives a fun, bubbly duo to cheer for, while the rats follow the cheese. Swiss cheese.",

You could pluck a scene from True Romance and show it as its own clip and the viewer might walk away slightly dazed but with a lucid point of view.For example:-The Dennis Hopper & Christopher Walken scene-When Alabama kills that guy-All of the Drexl scenes-All of the Lee Doniwitz scenesNevertheless, True Romance is packed with interesting characters that offer cohesion - - more so than just by good actors reading good lines. The actors seem to be knowledgeable that they are part of something great, and their performances, spoken words and subtleties reflect that greater knowledge.Not for the timid, True Romance may influence your movie theater candy-stand decision on whether you should purchase the Gummi Bears, or whether to go full throttle and get the all-beef frank.",

I dont know what it is about quentin taratino but many of the projects he's involved with provoke this response.Even though I know he was unhappy about natural born killers, i love that movie and feel the same way about it, you coould probally say the same for pulp fiction. True Romance is one of the greatest films to come out of the 90s, every scene, every line, every shot! Some movies just do it for you, this is one of those movies for me.

            "content": "Watching True Romance for the second time, I realised that it worked best to think of it as several brilliantly written and acted segments, strung together loosely by able direction (from the \"other\" Scott) and a \"whatever\" kind of plot.When I think of this film, the moments that come to mind are Clarence and Alabama eating pie at a dingy little diner, Clarence confronting Gary Oldman's wigga Drexl in his crack den, the classic Sicilian scene between Dennis Hopper and the inimitable Christopher Walken, James Gandolfini interrogating Bama at the motel.Then, I pause and try to remember how the characters got from the diner to Clarence's bed... And what happened directly prior to Gandolfini's scene? And how and when did Bama and Clarence get to L.A., anyway?I can't freakin remember! And this is simply because these are the wind- down moments, the story progression which takes a back seat to the writing and directing style, which are interchangeable at best and, when worse, totally pointless. This films is like Pulp Fiction lite, a collection of interrelated vignettes that ultimately build to something resembling a climax. The only difference is that I could virtually re-enact any and every scene of Pulp Fiction for you at the drop of a hat, because it's ALL vignette, and it's ALL written like these segmented parts of Romance, which is decidedly less memorable because of it.But, I mean, what kind of criticism is that: \"It's not as cool as Pulp Fiction.\" Jesus wasn't as cool as Pulp Fiction.So, 8/10, because the characters are endearing (especially Arquette as Alabama), the dialogue is undoubtedly Tarantino and because, watching it, I always envision what could have been a generic and insignificant film transcending its own genre and setting, all thanks to QT and, I suppose, even a little bit of help for Scott...And also for the Sicilian scene. God, I love that scene!!!",

            "content": "Tarantino sold this script in the 80s to attempts to raise funds for the making of Reservoir Dogs. For me, this is a great shame. Tony Scott was handed the duty of trying to turn it into a great film after the success of Reservoir Dogs, but failed. Each scene is just about pieced together in the most standard possible way, and Scott brings absolutely nothing to film of any distinguishable note. The awesome cast, obviously attracted by Tarantino's script (which hard large parts edited by Scott, including a different ending), is undoubtedly a true ensemble of modern greats, and yet Scott does them no favours. He gives the film virtually no direction, and keeps everything simple and safe like many of his other films. The lead characters played by Christian Slater and Patricia Arquette, seem dazed and confused through most of the film, and do nothing to grip the audience. Slater's character, for example, makes a bizarre transformation from loner to drug dealer, without ever really drawing a line between the two.The film keeps itself moving but by no means at a excitable rate as you predict each scene before it starts. It's one saving grace however, is a truly fantastic scene between two Hollywood heavyweights - Walken and Hopper. In Chris Walken's only scene in the film, he dominates and becomes his ruthless Mob boss character. Hopper is superb as a father hiding his son's secret. Apart from this intense scene (you can cut it with a butter knife), the film has no other stand outs, and is quite disappointing and an anti-climax.... if only Quentin Tarantino could of directed it, we could of ended up with a far superior piece of film...I would still recommend it to all film fans, if not only because of the Walken/Hopper scene... if it wasn't for that, there would be no point in seeing it.",

            "content": "True Romance, I have seen this movie about 50 times, No lie. And I can tell you right now, that every time I have watched it, I liked it even more. One reason why I did not write this review a long time go, when the movie came out is..... well...... The movie came out in 1993. Im 25 now and I'm pretty sure it was not a good movie for a lil dude to watch . But let me tell you, when i got older, I was never so happy to find an older movie that I loved Right off the bat! So that being said, let me give you a lil plot summary to spice up this review a bit. Clarence and Alabama are newlyweds who acquire an unexpected wedding present. Unknown to the blissfully happy couple, ruthless gangsters are on their tail, determined to reclaim their lost property......First I wanna get into the writing. Quentin Tarantino Is a great, great writer, Known for writing movies like, Reservoir Dogs, Pulp Fiction, Natural born Killers, From Dusk Till Dawn , Jackie Brown, Kill Bill vol 1 and 2, Death Proof, Inglourious Basterds and his upcoming film Django Unchained (which he all directed). So Obviously he has skills. but even with all those great movies under his belt. I think that True Romance is the best thing he has wrote..... SO far that is. and thats saying A lot. Just the way the story moves along and keeps you interested is Beautiful!!!!! By the end of the movie you feel like you know these characters and you actually care for them. You don't want anything bad to happen to them or worse die. The Directing, Tony F-ing Scott (Tony Scott) WOW! Known for Directing (just gonna say the ones i like) Top Gun, Crimson Tide, Enemy Of the State, Spy Game, Man On Fire, Domino, Deja Vu, The taking of Pelham 123, and unstoppable. In True Romanced He did an Outstanding job capturing the scenes and angles where you actually feel like your in the room with the characters. You feel there tension, the love, the hate and the innocence. For Example there is a scene with a GANGTER/PIMP (gary Oldman, Believe it or not) and Clarence (Christian Slater), In this scene you feel and see the anger clarence has towards this pimp, but its the way Tony Scott presents these scenes with there theme and mood that get the hairs on your neck to LITERALLY stand up. True Story, It happens to me every time i watch it. And it happens more then once.The Music, First off i wanna say Hans Zimmer is the man and if you have read any of my other reviews you will know that he is one of my favs. Known for (Seriously there is way to many so I'm only saying a few, and that's still gonna be a lot) Inception, Gladiator, The Dark Knight, Batman Begins, The Da Vinci Code, Black Hawk Down, The Last Samurai, The Rock and The Lion King. So in this film the music sounds like we are about to go to an island and drink pina coladas or go lay on the beach in the nice hot sun........ Sorry not happening here. Instead it throws you off a lil and makes you focus on whats going on in the film. thats what i always liked about Hans, he really sets the theme. But he doesn't always have a song playing in the background. Sometimes its just sounds and weird noises (BUT ITS MUSIC) . SO ALLLLLL OF ^THAT^ being said. Do I think you should go see this movie? What do you think? YES DUUUUUHHHH! The cast is SUPERB, You got Christian Slater (The guy who falls in love), Patricia Arquette ( The girl that falls in love with the guy), Dennis Hopper (The Guys Innoncent Father), Val Kilmer ( ELVIS.... Yes Elvis), Gary Oldman (Ganster/Drug Dealer/Pimp), Brad Pitt (Stoner on the couch, yes that is literally his role the whole movie), Christopher Walken (The DON of the MAFIA Family in this film), Samuel L. Jackson (Drug Dealer), Michael Rapaport (Cop), James Gandolfini (Mafia Muscle/Hit-man). I mean the cast ALONE is worth the watch. But then you got Quentin Tarantino Writing it, Tony Scott Directing it, hans Zimmer Composing it. LIKE what could be better? NOTHING! The definition of this movie is \"WIN WIN\"THIS MOVIE is a 10 out of 10 ALL DAY!",

The movie's plot is character-based, so the situations change around our main characters, played to key by Slater and Arquette.Speaking of actors, this movie has one of the best-assembled ensemble casts I've ever seen, and they all play their characters to the bone.  Christopher Walken is the mobster \"antichrist\", Oldman is the violent psychopath, Pitt's a stoner, Hopper's a retired cop with just a bit of fire left in his blood. Together, they're both entertaining to watch, and have great chemistry (the Walken/Hopper scene is classic).Overall very funny, violent, and Tarantino, True Romance also succeeds in being a genuinely good love story, that, despite all that blood, is really quite touching.",

            "content": "Bravo to Tony Scott who directed this film. I was really quite impressed with the outcome of this film. It was a Tarantino script which practically guarantees the viewer that what they are about see is full of wonderfully crafted violent sequences, smart storyline and wonderful characters that are wildly entertaining and sometimes dark and mysterious.So, the movie's plot is really quite simple. it centres on a loner guy, Clarence (Christian Slater), who inherits a call-girl, Alabama (Arquette) for one night on his birthday thanks to his boss whom we never meet funny enough. Anyway, Alabama pretends to be interested in kung-fu movies and comic books in order to entice Clarence. She succeeds. Alabama however, after a night of steamy love-making with Clarence, falls for him and admits it along with the admission of her being a call-girl. The flow of events that follows are really quite intriguing and are punctuated with as star-studded cast that is bound to wetten the taste-buds of any movie buff. We have Gary Oldman as Drexy Spivl, a cocaine obsessed WIGGER of a pimp who Clarence kills when he arrives at Drexl's joint to pick up Alabma's possessions. Then we have Val Kilmer as Clarence's sub-conscious alter-ego and despite never actually seeing his face, we are entranced by his words of wisdom to Clarence and we are persuaded into thinking of him as a kind of Elvis like character. Following on, we have Dennis Hopper as Clarence's father, an ex-cop whom is unwillingly and unknowingly entwined into Clarence's mess after Clarence kills Drexl Spivy and Hopper meets an untimely death at the hands of Vincenzo Coccotti (Christopher Walken).Adding amusing turns are Brad Pitt as a stoner room-mate of Clarence's friend Dick and among others, Chris Penn as a hard-hitting but determined cop on the trail of some huge cocaine deals in and around Hollywood. Oh I cant forget Samuel L Jackson's brief turn as Big Don who is on screen for about 30 seconds discussing eating pussy and ass. Hilariously vulgar!Scott uses vivid colours and compelling dialogue to entrance the viewer and the film is given a somewhat light-hearted tone thanks to the xylophonic jingle of Hans Zimmer.Overall, I thoroughly enjoyed this film and wasn't deluded beforehand into expecting some sort of masterpiece that should ave swept me of my feet. No, what I expected was a well-scripted, well-acted and skillfully directed film that produced a few laughs and thrills. That's exactly what I got and was entirely satisfied. 9/10. Highly recommendable!",

It is the scenes which include their characters which really make the film so good, I thought the Drexell scene was very funny.

            "content": "Pulp Fiction is seen as Tarantino's best movie, but True Romance is overlooked. While it wasn't directed by Tarantino and doesn't go into situations as bizarre as Pulp Fiction, True Romance was one of his first screenplays. Fortunately it was picked up by Tony Scott after being sold. You know how people say things are \"high-octane\" when the stuff has energy, but they don't want to think of a real way to explain it? Octane is the oxygen in gasoline that makes it burn slower in cars to get more mileage. This movie had the right amount of octane to be fast-paced, but not blow past its human moments. There was plenty of nitrous-oxide on the way to help it be batshit crazy.The first twenty minutes of this movie were insane. We see a ridiculous love story that's believable and very well acted by Christian Slater and Patricia Arquette. We see a shootout with a wigger pimp played by Gary Oldman. And most importantly, we see a huge briefcase of cocaine fall into the couple's possession, forcing them to sell it in Hollywood. The story wastes no time moving right along to the conclusion that is a solid example of convergence.The one thing that threw me off was the score. It wasn't fitting in a lot of scenes. Hanz Zimmer is the man as far as movie scoring goes, but it was awkward in this film. It wasn't crime drama music. It was we're-going-to-the-beach-with-our-xylophones-and-bongos-man kind of music. This got in the way of some deeper character moments that would have been better left without music at all, let alone this music. Halfway through the movie this trend of unfitting music tapers off and doesn't disturb the torture scene, the climax, or a few other key pieces.I loved the hell out of every scene in this movie. It was a prime example of both crime and drama. Character is so often shoved to the side in an act of domestic violence by its abusive owner: action. In True Romance, the two concepts were married and stayed together until their chaotic, but fitting and synchronous passing in the last scene. Should I meet the cast and crew, I'll blow them all over-exaggerated air kisses. Mwah to you. Mwah to you. Mwah to this movie. Entertainment with sympathetic characters has happened before us, let it not be forgotten.",

The cast and acting in this movie are amazing. Once again, Tarrantino serves up a no-crap array of characters.  Patricia Arquette is EXCELLENT.  i saw this and thought she'd be my new favorite actress, until i remembered how horrible she was in Stigmata. The story is, a guy meets this hooker, they fall in love.  He goes to confront her pimp and ends up killing him and stealing a huge case of coke. The coke belongs to a very big time dealer who then chases after them and finally catches up to them when they try to sell it.  As a guy with a girlfriend, there's a scene where one of the 'bad guys' goes to retrieve the drugs and finds Arquette alone with them that just angered me.  Not in the sense that i was offended by it, but because you become so infatuated with her character you hate to see something done to her.  He basically beats the hell out of her, fortunately she gets payback though. Once again, the cast is great.  I dont recall seeing more than a few no-namers or people i hadnt seen in other films.  We're once again treated to an excellent performance by Chris Penn. i highly highly recommend this.  dont even bother renting it, just buy it.",

            "content": "True Romance is my favorite movie of all time.  The story is compelling. The acting is exquisite.  The dialogue is what takes it to another level. The movie is funny in a weird way because of the dialogue.  Gary Oldman should have been nominated for best supporting actor if his role had been a little bit bigger.  Then again, you could say that about Christopher Walken's performance also.  The scene between Walken and Dennis Hopper was absolutely awesome!  Gary Oldman amazes me in every role he portrays.  An English actor that is able to \"nail\" that \"wannabe\" accent that Drexl has is just incredible.  It is a very violent movie but it was violent for the sake of being violent.  It was necessary to understand the charachters and their definition of \"True Romance\".  James Gandolfini shows his brilliance in portraying a mobster strongman which no doubt lead to his casting in The Sopranos.  Tom Sizemore and Chris Penn add interesting dialogue that I particularly found funny.  Even Bronson Pinchot had a good part in this flick.  Saul Rubinek was excellent in portraying fat cat movie producer Lee Donowitz. The Bottom line:  Great short performances out of Oldman, Walken, Hopper, Rubinek,Gandolfini and solid short performances out of Michael Rappaport, Tom Sizemore, Chris Penn,Bronson Pinchot, Val Kilmer and Brad Pitt.  Christian Slater and Patricia Arquette provide their best performances as the two main charachters who define \"True Romance\" a little differently than the rest of us.  I think the title of the movie threw off mainstream America and mislead them to believe it was a \"romance\" in the traditional sense.",

So it prompt me to come look up info about it AGAIN, and I realize nobody has posted here for years, but I just had to add something.If you read the other comments, you will realize that this is an action packed, star studded movie that snuck under the block buster radar back in 1993. I think the title turns most people off, and I remember a critic saying that back then.But that is my point. If you follow this movie closely, and you know how Quentin loves his dialog, you will realize that this is a very very romantic movie. What Clarence does for his love, is close to what spiderman does in his favorite comic book he talks about. Clarence is just a mild mannered, boring nobody, he's not a gangster or tough guy.. it's just what he is willing to do for his soulmate and to guarantee a happy ever after.OK, enough.. nobody will probably read this.. but I just had to throw my 2 cents in about my most favorite movie of all time.

Dennis Hopper excels as the ex-alcoholic father of Clarence (Christian Slater) especially in the best scene the film (the eggplant scene).

Why? I guess because the first 30 minutes was the best start to a movie I have ever encountered and so once there was a change in pace the movie lost interest a little. If I were the director no way I'd kill off such a great character in Drexl so soon.The movie did have a strong ending though when everyone was gathered at the hotel room for the exchange of money for drugs where a final shootout takes place.I enjoyed Val Kilmer who played the mentor just before Clarence was about to make a decision - Killin's the hard part, getting away with it, that's easy. You think a cop gives a f**k about a pimp? Listen. Every pimp in the world gets shot. Two in the back of the f**kin head. Cops'd throw a party, man As long as your not at the scene with a smokin gun in your hand you'll get away with it This movie had so many well known actors who all played their part from Christopher Walken, Dennis Hopper and a younger James Gandolfini. Even Brad Pitt put in a great performance as Floyd who sat around all day smokin drugs.The only weakness I found in this movie was straight after Christopher Walken kills Dennis Hopper which was a scene that was brilliantly written.True Romance was a well written and acted out movie!!!",

But each line in the movie has the Quentin Tarantino trademark on it as Quentin Tarantino did write this movie.  I find this film similar to \"Reservoir Dogs\" because at the end of the movie at the climax you have everyone in the same room pointing guns at each other.  The cast in \"True Romance\" is great from Christian Slater, Patricia Arquette, Dennis Hopper, and Christopher Walken.  I especially like Gary Oldman's character as he plays as a pimp.

            "review_title": "True Romance (1993) [Directed by Tony Scott]",
            "content": "NOTE: This review is in reference to the Unrated Director's Cut, and it may refer to some scenes not featured in the original release.True Romance has for a long time been considered the middle-piece in a loose trilogy by filmmaker Quentin Tarantino, wedged in between the now-classic Reservoir Dogs (1992) and the always timeless Pulp Fiction (1994). However, I am urged to disagree with public opinion -- as is usual -- and shed some light on why True Romance is not a Tarantino film. Firstly, it is directed by Tony Scott -- a man who's had his moments, but should really leave movie-making to Ridley -- and, therefore, has a very shallow, action-based tone (despite it's desperate attempt to be categorized as independent). This is made extremely evident in some utterly ludicrous \"adrenaline-rush\" scenes (e.g. the roller-coaster segment) and in the inscrutably dull performance of Michael Rapaport (who plays a poor -- both financially and literally -- actor somehow capable of purchasing rare, out-of-print film posters, framing them, and hanging them on his wall). But I must confess that what irritated me most about True Romance was the ending. For those of you who aren't as well-informed about Quentin and this screenplay, the original ending (SPOILERS AHEAD) involved Clarence being killed in the Mexican stand-off and Alabama becoming a call-girl once again (eventually teaming up with Mr. White from Reservoir Dogs). Tony attempted to justify his compromise -- which is basically having Clarence and Alabama live happily ever after, despite the fact that stole a suitcase full of cocaine and pumped more shotgun shells in their opponents than any other two lovers I've seen on the silver screen -- by saying that (and I quote) \"I loved the two main characters so much that I wanted them to get away with it.\" Although I may not speak on behalf of the reader or any other viewer, I didn't care at all for Clarence or Alabama. Perhaps if their roles had been given to more experienced and \"loveable\" actors, this ending would have worked. Okay, I will give this to fans of the film: Patricia Arquette isn't bad, but I couldn't stop thinking that Christian Slater looked like the devil. This said, True Romance does have some good aspects: the soundtrack was unique and worked well with the mood, Quentin cleverly incorporated Elvis' ghost into the screenplay, and supporting actors James Gandolfini and Chris Walken are great. The best thing about this movie, though -- and the only thing that keeps me from giving it a lower grade -- is Brad Pitt. His performance is, for lack of a better word, hysterical! And I found it very interesting that even though all he does throughout the film is lie on a couch and get high, he ends up causing half of the deaths in the movie -- and no one even knows it. Also, I feel compelled to mention the recently released 2-disc DVD set, which features Quentin's only audio commentary ever recorded, and a montage of the alternate ending. In conclusion, Tony Scott's interpretation of True Romance might have worked if Pulp Fiction or Reservoir Dogs had never been made, but with shoes that big to fill, it can't help but become a failure.Grade: C-",

He works in a comic-book store, has a fixation with Elvis Presley, and on his birthday every year he goes to the cinema alone to watch a Martial Arts Triple Bill.

From the ridiculously strong casting to the excellent script (written by none other than Quentin Tarintino), almost everything about this movie is stylish, cool and near perfection.As I fore mentioned above, the cast is full of some of the best actors in the business. Christian Slater is in top form as Clarence, a loser working in a comic store who comes across the opportunity of a life time when he and his newlywed wife, Alabama (Patricia Arquette) come across a suitcase of uncut cocaine. They begin their road trip, setting off to sell the lot to a rich client and living off it for the rest of their lives.All is not as easy at is seems, though. Upon their travel they get tracked down by a gang of Sicilian mobsters (led by Christopher Walken) who were the original owners of the cocaine. What follows is a high octane, super stylish chase full of moments of laughter, breathlessness and shock, including one of the most infamous speeches in cinematic history delivered by Dennis \"your grandmother f****d a n*****\" Hopper. What should also be noted is the quality of directing. The action comes thick and fast with numerous gunfights breaking up the story including the breathtaking final\u00e9 proving an obvious highlight and also the shocking scene where Alabama gets beaten to within an inch of her life by one of the Sicilians mobsters. Moments like this are so brilliantly choreographed that it brings out the deepest of emotions from you.All in all this is a movie that simply must be seen as soon as possible. Please don't deny yourself of the experience of this balls out action flick as it is a modern classic and you'll be hard matched to find anything better for a Friday night in.Rating: *****",

He did a good move in giving the script to Scott. Scott knows what to do when it comes to movies and i know he let Tarantino make the movie almost like a partner. All of the characters were well thought up and deep. Walken has a great role as does Hopper. Drexel could be one of the best villains of all time. This is one of the 3 movies that all tie in to each other in Quentin's mind. This, Resevoir Dogs, and Pulp Fiction are all connected. With Vincent and Vic being brothers and Mr. White and Alabama being lovers/partners in crime this shows yet another way Quentin is one hell of a script writer. I know the ending is not as Quentin dreamed up, but there is a good viewing of his ending in the Directors cut of this movie. The movie has everything you want. Thrills, Kills, and blood Spills. The movie is also a love story in a true Quentin T. fashion. This movie is probably my favorite movie of all time. its a 10 of 10.",

I bought Reservoir Dogs on video, but for some reason never purchased True Romance, until recently when I picked up the Special Edition DVD. Time has passed, obviously. I still like Tarantino, and I count Jackie Brown as one of my top ten favorite movies of all time. But True Romance, it seems, hasnt really aged well. Thats not to say that it is, by any means, a bad movie. It's not. What it means is that, looking back on it now, you can see future Tarantino-ism's, before they really matured. Theres the love-story at it's center, not unlike Natural Born Killers (and even to an extent Jackie Brown). The stoner who sits on the couch all day smoking. The Mexican Stand-off. I could go on, but I think you see my point. True Romance was the first screenplay that he wrote, and it makes sense that some of what he wrote would find its way into his other movies. I'm not faulting the movie for that. What I am saying, though, is that if you've seen all of his other movies, then you have seen this.",

Tarantino wrote the movie And Tony Scott was the director. For this kind of writing, directors you can hire.The screenplay is the most important creative process. And Scott changed True Romance to give the movie a happy ending. That was to avoid depressing the US test audience (no doubt in LA). But these days movies make their money worldwide as downloads, so why not test a movie with an international audience? They may well have gone with the original Tarantino ending (which I will not reveal here. Don't want to spoil the lucky first time viewer).True Romance is one of the greatest movies of all time - and one I watch every year. Along with Grosse Pointe Blank, John Wayne's True Grit, the Danish version of Girl With a Dragon Tattoo, The Girl Who Played with Fire and It's a Mad Mad Mad Mad World.Do these movies have something in common? Yes - the story sells the movie. And it rolls along like a barrel down a hill -- you can't help watch where it's going. That is something the writers of the James Bond movies, including Skyfall (boring) should take on board.Ian Flemming took the 'James Bond' name from a book on his shelf. The book, by James Bond is \"Birds of The West Indies\". That probably had a better story line than Skyfall.Peter",

He has a small part in this movie but he does bring humor to his role. Gary Oldman is truly creepy as a pimp and really makes you not like him at all.

Those were some really interesting characters who disappeared so fast. 2, Hans Zimmer's score is maybe the worst score I have ever heard in my life!

However, unfortunately, most of the stars only appear in brief minutes, like Samuel L. Jackson (you can hardly tell it's him) and Val Kilmer. I was disappointed that Gary Oldman's character (excellent) had only one big scene. Brad Pitt was fantastic, his character must be the coolest junkie I've ever seen on film (ok ok Johnny Depp was also terrific in Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas). Also, most of these actors didn't even act together, which was a shame. The main characters are played by Christian Slater (not very good) and Patricia Arquette (ouch... how HOT can she get?).\nThis film lives by \"flashes\" instead of the development of the story (which is pretty basic). For instance, the little \"chat\" between Christopher Walken and Dennis Hopper, the fight between Gandolfini and Arquette, the Oldman vs Slater scene, any scene with Brad Pitt, and finally, the ending, were all memorable.I saw this mainly because Quentin wrote it, but I guess that the Two Thumbs Up go to the director Tony Scott and the actors. Quentin made it possible, but they made it memorable. I guess it's just good team work.If you just want to know if you should watch this or if it is a waste of time, well, I guess I would definitely recommend it for the scenes I mentioned, but don't expect an amazing plot.

            "content": "The Ultimate Hollywood FairytaleA script that was (party) written by Quentin Tarantino seems to be impossible to get on film. Nevertheless, Tony Scott took a shot and delivers the fairytale about \"the movies\". After some modifications in the storyline (which was originally connected to Tarantino's Reservoir Dogs), Scott and co. produced a true classic.Leading character Clarence Worley (Slater) guides you during a wild ride, which contains literally sex, drugs and rock and roll. Basically, the story is about Clarence who meets Alabama (Arquette), a callgirl, falls in love with her and attempts to start a new life with her. However, there are some complications concerning her pimp, Drexl (Oldman). Clarence and Alabama end up stealing cocaine from Alabama's former pimp. The newlyweds decide to sell the drugs in Hollywood, finding themselves chased by the former owners of the \"half a mill\" worth of drugs. True Romance is a film that should be regarded as the guide through Hollywood. The incredible strong cast (with appearances of, amongst others, Samuel L. Jackson, Brad Pitt, Christopher Walken, James Gandolfini and Dennis Hopper) delivers the most comic, over exaggerated, varying and creative characters imaginable. Literally every part of this movie is overdone; from the Elvis impression by Kilmer, to the stereotype director Donowitz (Rubinek). Why then, do I rate this movie with 8 points out of the 10 possible? Simply because in this movie the interaction between the actors in every scene is just fantastic, which truly is the engine of the picture. Above that, the dialogues are brilliant, and you will find yourself laughing out loud on more than 1 occasion. Most of the times it is not a good sign when you are laughing out loud during serious dialogues in an action-filled motion picture. This is not the case for True Romance. Scott displays the action fairytale in which everything is possible. The choice of exaggerating every character and scene turns out to be the magic touch that turns this movie in to a classic. Although the entire movie keeps you on the edge of your seat, the scene where Walken, playing a mobster, visits Clarence's father, Hopper, is the very best part of this picture. During this scene, which contains of more than 10 minutes of dialogue, you are blown away by the actors' performance, their lines, character and appearance. In this scene, Gandolfini also displays his talent of playing a fearless gangster. True Romance provides an adrenaline rush, which does not stop until the very end. Referring to Gandolfini's character, watching this movie truly feels like tasting the snow at the end of the rainbow. Hollywood's rainbow, that is.",

The movie centers around these two characters, and a suitcase full of cocaine Clarence finds after killing Alabama's pimp Drexl (played by Gary Oldman) in his sleazy whore house. After realizing they have a suitcase full of cocaine, this takes them down a journey that involves the mafia, police officials, and the movie industry.

Living characters hiding in cliched but rich characters The criticism it received for it's emphasis on violence, and extrapolation of characters is most likely the same criticism Spielberg received when he took aliens and comic-book heroes like Indiana Jones, and revered them into movie theaters.\nQuentin took the people that read the dime magazine romance novels, underground comics that treat love like a child's plaything, mobsters that are aware of their own violence, and placed them in the world as it can horribly turn out to be.I'm a big romantic comedy fan, and could empathize with how many details are peppered onto Patricia Arquette's character as the woman of someone's dreams. She might not be perfect, but she reminds that the woman you fall in love with aren't perfect, and that's why you love them.\nThe first few scenes between the two of them evolve so naturally and at the same time with that dime-magazine exaggeration that it becomes compelling to love them and judge them. Especially when you can distance yourself from them, call them comic-geeks and white trash. Where the writing gets you is that you still love these two, because they're as afraid of waht they're into as any could ever be.The violence is effective. Your heart is broken when you realize how much your heart could possibly bleed for years knowing that while your lady was dying for you in a hotel room, you were out buying burgers and talking about Elvis. And dying because she thought you to be the woman you always wanted to be for somebody but you know you're not. The love of a good woman, who ain't perfect but lives in a reality that makes you the strongest man alive is a truly romantic way to live forever. It's the biggest most deliciious slice of America's culture that anybody could want. It's America, living fast, making fresh new love in a phone booth in the desert, while the biggest truck in the world rolls past. 10/10",

Jackson..... blah blah blah the list goes on. Now don't get me wrong. A lot of these well known names only have a few minutes on screen but trust me when i say that these few minutes are .... well .... genius. My personal favorite is a scene with Walken and Hopper (i don't want to ruin it, not that i could).... but it is what film was made for. This film has a number of rememberable quotes (and if you can't remember them, you will be learning them to tell your friends)..... honestly, you will. The \"theme music\" for this movie is also perfect. You are guarantied to recognise it. Hans Zimmer!!!! I friend introduced me to this film and if i have introduced it to you, I hope but secretly know you will introduce it to others. It's simply ..... genius!!!",

            "review_title": "Dispelling the myths on Sicilians",
            "content": "Tarantino was both erroneous and entirely unfair concerning the Sicilian people. Clifford Worley's remarks are as racist as white supremacist Arthur Kemp when he asserts that Sicilians are of a mixed race.  Worley is racist remarks use false historical evidence claiming this just for the sake of race baiting that the Moors are responsible for the injection of sub-Saharan African blood into Sicily. First fact is, the Moors were not black. They were Hamito-Semitic peoples, meaning that they began as Semites from the Near East and then absorbed physically similar Hamites, or Berbers, during their conquest of North Africa, prior to entering Europe. Moors who colonized most of the Iberian peninsula for 800 years are estimated to have left a mere 3.8% genetic imprint on modern Iberians. Hence, those Muslims who held Sicily for a comparatively shorter period of just 250 years and, in their thwarted efforts to take mainland Italy, conquered various Southern Italian cities for periods of less than 100 years, had an even lesser genetic impact on Italian populations.  Secondly the \"Norman\" King Roger II, the founder of the kingdom of Sicily during the first half of the twelfth century liberated the island from the Islamic yoke. His kingdom was mixed east-west culture and the development of its royal government the most advanced in twelfth-century Europe.   After Roger Sicily was the home to a large Jewish population, became Spanish Colony, and held under the Viceroys of Spain from the late 13th century to the early 18th century making the population more of a Judeo/Greco/Espa\u00f1a blended ethnicity.  Moreover, the unfortunate blacks that were brought enslaved into Europe by imperialists at the start of the Atlantic slave trade were  absorbed into their host populations, often by way of royal houses. It was Britain, France, Holland and Germany who were then the dominant colonial powers and slave traders.     Therefore, this leads back to Tarantino's statement which can now only be construed to be there for its shock value only; it is total untrue, and never be taken as fact. Unfortunately there are too many white racists out there who take lines from movies as Gospel truth to support and fuel the fires of their own prejudices. For certain, there will be more battles ahead dispelling the myths concerning Sicilian people.Bibliography:For further information look up The Races of Europe, Chapter XII, Section 7, Italy, and http://www.geocities.com/racial_myths/italians.html",

It seems odd that he has his one scene and then only his men are involved throughout the rest of the movie.I went back and forth on whether to give this movie a 6 or 7, but as I think back to the earlier parts of the movie, it's worth it's 7.",

All I will say about the characters is this: watch for Brad Pitt's character, he only has a few minutes, but you won't be disappointed. Also, watch for the scene between Christopher Walken and Dennis Hopper. It may be the best scene in a film that I can remember.The thing that makes it it hard for True Romance to gain the acceptance of other Tarantino's films is that it really is a romance story and most of Tarantino's fans (I assume) are male and are probably not interested and or threatened by watching a \"love story\". However this is romance Tarantino style with violence and blood galore injected with appropriately timed humor. But like all good movie dramas an attachment to the characters is vital to the emotional impact of the movie and it is the love story in this that makes every gun fight, torture, or death that much more interesting, meaningful, and powerful.If you like other Tarantino movies see this one, you will definitely like it.

The actors are entirely comfortable in their roles and mesh together so well that it is hard to believe that many of them were only on set for a day or two. A word of warning: THIS MOVIE IS NOT FOR EVERYONE! Foul language and over-the-top violence abound, but it is all done in good fun. If these elements are not enough to deter you from seeing a movie, do not deprive yourself of such a bona-fied classic entertainment. Bronston Pinchot is genius, Brad Pitt makes his part so much bigger than it really is, and Val Kilmer becomes the greatest actor to ever play Elvis without ever being clearly seen on camera.

Dialogues seems realistic and convincing to me.

I admit, others have knocked it off the top spot occasionally, but when someone says fav film, true romance springs to mind. The acting is excellent, teh direction and gun fight at the end where masterly handled. And of course with Quentin Tarintino being one of the most brilliant writers of our time the dialouge and film itself is funny as hell. The characters u all get to know, there are great preformances lead by Christian Slater and Patrica Arquette, a whole load of famous cameos (Christopher Walken and Samuel L. Jackson to name a couple), Tony Scott is now one of my fav directors (Enemy of the State was also a Gem), and Tom Sizemore I think stole the film as Cody Nicholson, him and his cop partner Dimes were the greatest LA Cops ever, even if they were only in it for twenty minutes. All actors should take note of how to preform from this film, and take Nicholson's advice, 'Ur an actor act motherf****r!' A tour de force",

            "content": "Having watched True Romance, I have now seen every film that Quentin Tarantino has had a major involvement in (i.e the films he wrote and directed, not the ones he presented). It's fair to say that none of them have disappointed me - except Jackie Brown, but I'll moan about that if and when I review it- and True Romance is absolutely no exception!I loved this film, fair and square. But what's so intriguing about it is that it's unlike any of Tarantino's other films...maybe that's because he didn't direct, he only wrote it, and it is slightly lovy dovy - not something I would expect from Quentin! Most of the soundtrack is songs I would never really expect to hear in one of Q.T's flicks (espically the song that's played almost every time someone has an intimate conversation) and a lot of the cast I just would never expect to see in association with him. That may sound a little negative but come on, ask yourself, before you heard of this film, did you really expect to see Gary Oldman in a Tarantino movie...I don't think so! Having said this though, when you listen to some of the dialogue, you can instantly tell it's Q.T's words. I don't really know how to explain it but, you'll know what I mean. Oh and Samuel L. Jackson makes a short appearance too!One of the things that attracted me to this movie was the cast. Gary Oldman (one of my fav's), Brad Pitt, Val Kilmer, Christopher Walken and Dennis Hopper. I'll be honest, I have never seen a Christian Slater movie (other than Robin Hood, but I don't count that as a Slater movie) and I wasn't really all that fussed about seeing him, but I tell you, he just really sits right with Tarantino's screenplay. Of course, I don't really think he was the only actor that could have cast has \"Clarence\", but he shone none the less. Once more, I felt that he really made a proper connection with Patricia Arquette, or rather \"Alabama\" - the love interest. Christian and Patricia are the stars of the film and are in pretty much every scene, but all of the other big names get a maximum of 2 scenes - though I think Dennis Hopper had 3. This may come has a bit of a downer to those of you who are looking to see your favourite actor, but don't be disappointed - remember, Anthony Hopkins stole Silence of the Lambs and he was only in it for 15 minutes! Gary Oldman's performance was utterly staggering and slightly frightening; not only was he in a film I didn't him to be in, but he was also playing a role I could never have imagined him as. He plays...wait for it...a pimp who thinks he's black! Who'd of thought Commissioner Gordon could pull that off? The one scene that Christopher Walken is in, and I mean ONE, is one of my favourite parts of the film. Chris just reels you in when he says \"I'm the Anti-Christ\" in his very thick accent! Now, I really enjoy Val Kilmer's films (don't ever mention Batman Forever to me though, that film just makes me weep) and I was looking forward to him playing another one of these amazing cameos, but the credits rolled and I just couldn't for the life of me remember seeing him and I'm sure that those of you who watch this film, and don't watch Val on a loop, will feel the same way. I looked at his name in the credits and it says he plays a character called \"Mentor\" and I had no I idea who the hell he was. But, then it hit me, there are two scenes in the film where Clarence (Slater) is MENTORED by his hero, Elvis Presley, and when looked back at those scenes I thought that Elvis did sound quite a bit like Val's character in Tombstone. So now you know...and knowing is half the battle! Though his face is blurred, so you can't see his questioning face.The soundtrack is simple to judge, all of the songs that feature are stuck in my brain and...I like it!People who will like this: Tarantino fans, Oldman fans, Walken fans, Slater fans, Rom-Com fans, Gangster fansPeople who won't like this: Those who fancy Val Kilmer, those who didn't like Platoon due to it's over-repeated main theme",

Almost all of the 'big name extra' type characters are excellent, especially Pitt, Hopper and Walken, it's just a pity that individually none of them had much screen time. It's not meant to be believable, so don't slam it just because you find it unrealistic or something...it's Tarantino and Tony Scott, live with it.

It is absolutely shameless in its exploitation of excessive violence, over-acting, melodrama, lurid sex, and rampant drug use...I love it. Quentin Tarantino, as I'm sure everyone knows, wrote the story, but it is the in execution that this film pays off. The cast, oh the cast: The lynchpins are Christian Slater and Patricia Arquette. They both give solid performances, which prevents the film from flying off the tracks; they serve as the pilot light. The supporting roles are the gas. The Walken/Hopper show down has been oft sighted as the film's best aspect, and this is, arguably, true. Just watch this scene and then watch it again. Sparks actually shoot out of the screen and burn people about the head and shoulders. OK, you've got Val Kilmer as the ghost of Elvis, Brad Pitt as a disgruntled pot-smoking loser, Tom Sizemore & Chris Penn as cops, James Gandolfini (pre-Sopranos) as a reflective hit-man, and you've even got Bronson Pinchot (from TV's PERFECT STRANGERS) for God's sake. Did I forget Gary Oldman? Do yourself a favor and rent every single Gary Oldman related project (they're not all good films, but...). Why is Gary Oldman not in every film ever made? Why? I ask you why? He has got to be the best actor working today, hands down. As Drexel Spivey, Oldman chews the scenery, digests it, and then expels it from every orifice. Keep in mind that he is an English actor with a normal speaking voice at home in the Royal Shakespeare Company. His performance here is second only to his turn in LEON in blatant over-the-top insanity. Tony Scott, who along with his brother Ridley, has been known to over-direct a film or two, here chooses wisely to basically set up the camera and run. The score by Hans Zimmer adds a bouncy xylophone driven theme to the film and finds the right balance. This a well made, balls-to-the-wall, popcorn throwing, cult classic. In a market dominated with stereotypical characters, this movie avoids that trap by letting the stereotypes flourish with all the grotesque absurdity it can muster. 9/10",

True Romance quite simply rocks. The cameos, the monalogues the grrrl power the style and charachters the words and wit. In a quote  \" I like this film Clarence. Always have, always will.\"",

            "content": "The everyday dialogue laced with humour coming from Tarantino-involved films is the best part of them for me and True Romance is a great hi-energy movie with plenty of snappy lines. But (and this is now looking at it from 2022) the reason it scores 6 for me is that problematic Christopher Walken/Dennis Hopper scene. The dialogue there is so full on that it breaks through the screen and have you thinking about whether you should be enjoying watching the movie, or taking more from it, or analysing the issues stemming from the dialogue. I suspect it wasn't intended to do that, but the impact of it for me is that it detracts from a great movie by making you think too much.",

Watch out for Patricia Arquette being the only female in this lineup, her scene with the earlier mentioned James Gandofini is beyond comprehension. Also, super \"first time\" performance by Brad. The ending scene is also worth commenting, Saul Rubinek has a wonderful cokefiend outburst towards Bronson Pinchot. Watch this movie over and over again.Marvelous!!!",

I'm not a big Christian Slater fan but the role seems to suit him and Arquette does a fantastic job of playing the part Uma Thurman would have had had Tarantino the gift of foresight.

For a film that has often been dubbed a movie geek's wet dream, it sure is a great ride.As a film he wrote before he ever did Reservoir Dogs and Pulp Fiction, Quentin Tarantino's script, brought to life by director Tony Scott, is considered to be a trashy first film where everything is ridiculously and overblown for the sake of being overblown.  But QT acknowledged this, and anyone who finds fault in this and likes his other films needs to recognize that this is a tribute to such films in the manner of Jackie Brown (Black exploitation) and Kill Bill (grindhouse cinema).This film packs all the genres in just like Tarantino's other scripts, but this one benefits from one major thing: romance.  Many of the most ardent fans praise this as the reason they like this above all his work.  And if that doesn't suit you, the film's got a dozen more genres packed in.",

This is Tarantino's story and it should have been his film to direct instead of Tony Scott (not that he's a bad director). My reason for this thought, is that after watching every film Tarantino has created it saddens me that he hasn't fully constructed True Romance. The true Romance cast was perfect and he could have produced some sheer magic with the chosen actors. Also, the music would have been completely different if Tarantino was utterly in charge.Tony Scott was out of his domain filming True Romance. He simply did not display Tarantino's ambiguousness as it should have been. Now you might ask yourself why I gave the film such a high rating. The answer is merely simple. This movie is still awesome disregarding my little problem. It grasped me from beginning to end. The unexpected kept on leaping towards me. I thoroughly enjoyed every part of the film, including the romantic one's (hence the title of the film). This is the core of Tarantino's complicated mind that has brought us so many masterpieces. Tony Scott did do a wonderful job with the complicated story he was given. It is only a shame that this film wasn't Tarantino's directing debut.

The plot is comprised of many different genres including romance, action and comedy. The romance between Clarence and Alabamma is in my mind the greatest on screen romance in a film. The attraction between them remains strong throughout the film. The comedy varies between farcical scenes such as the three way shoot out at the end and the pop culture chatter from all the characters. The action also crops up in every other scene. There are even some highly serious scenes including the classic mafia scene at the beginning. The superb direction from Tony Scott and the brilliant script from Quentin Tarantino together with the outstanding performances from the cast and great soundtrack all contribute to make this film a classic all round film and in my mind, the best film there is.",

So here it goes!Released in 1993, True Romance is an American romantic crime film written by Quentin Tarantino and directed by Tony Scott. It revolves around Clarence Worley (Christian Slater) who is a comic book nerd and an obsessive fan of Elvis Presley and Kung-fu movies, and Alabama (Patricia Arquette), a call girl who was hired by Clarence's generous boss as a birthday present. After watching three Sonny Chiba movies together, Alabama confesses her love for him and they get married the very next day. (Can you smell the drama?) To relieve Alabama from the clutches of her pimp, Drexl (Gary Oldman) Clarence kills Drexl and accidently grabs a suitcase of cocaine on his way out thinking it is Alabama's clothing. They both jump in a pink Cadillac bound for Los Angeles with dreams of a better life ahead of them, but the mob is soon after them. Trying to offload the drugs, they tangle with cops, criminals and worst of all, Hollywood producers.True Romance is an energetic roller-coaster, bursting with iconic dialogue and remarkable characters, with stealing, killing, cheating and romance all rolled into one to brew the perfect Tarantino movie. Though the soundtrack isn't that catchy as Pulp Fiction or Reservoir Dogs, You're so cool by Hans Zimmer stays with you. Patricia's commitment to the role is apparent with changing and demanding effort to play the character of Alabama in totally contrasting situations. Every character has individualized personalities making a lasting impact on the viewers. There's also a tint of magic realism with Clarence receiving visitations from a figure who can only be interpreted as ghost of Elvis - who convinces him to risk everything for Alabama. There's a gazillion references to pop culture for this generation to know about. If you are a Tarantino fan, you must watch it. If you are not a Tarantino fan yet, watch True Romance to become one.",

Certainly not a movie for the kitties but just one of the coolest movies ever made , A great crime/action/a little bit of everything, and of course with that great Tarantino script, this is in my top five movies of all time, no hyperbole this is amazing",

My favorite seen is the one between Clarence and Drexell, my friends and I have been saying those lines to each other for years now. To hear that a special edition DVD is coming out 9/24/02 is the best news I have heard since hearing that Star Trek TNG was coming out on DVD. I will say that this is probably more of a guy movie, your girlfriend isn't going to like it that much (even though Brad Pitt is in it). There is one particullary violent seen with Alabama and one of the mob's clean up guys played by none other than Tony Soprano, you'll laugh when you hear him say, \"i true (threw) up on the first one.\"\nI love everything about this film, the dialouge, acting, and cast are all fantastic. Buy this movie and share it with your friends. I promise you will be using the playmate profile sheet out of Playboy for questions to ask your future Alabama or all the sudden start using the phrase \"i knew something had to be rotten in Denmark.\" Also I have to mention that \"it's better to have and not need then to need and not have\" is a phrase that I have used many many many times.It's also interesting to note that the characters named Drexell, Alabama, and Scagnetti that are in this movie are all mentioned in Resivoir Dogs. I'd love to hear the writter's story on that.",

Short cameos from actors such as Christopher Walken, Dennis Hopper, Brad Pitt (before fame), James Gandofini are superbly directed and acted.

Slater and Arquette are great, but to see Walken, Hopper, Pitt, Galdolfino and (barely recogniseable as Elvis)Val Kilmer strut their stuff with no limitations is simply classic cinema. Just a great ride and possibly my favourite movie of all time.

Few films can claim to have had so great an influence on television history. \n\nI was worried when Patricia Arquette started falling over Christian Slater as he awkwardly explained kung fu movies and Spiderman comics to her; it seemed that the film was trending towards being a shut-in's fantasy made reality. Fortunately, there was a sigh of relief as Alabama revealed herself to be a hired callgirl. In the rest of True Romance, which Tarantino has described as his \"most autobiographical film\" (which is ironic considering that he didn't direct it), we maintain that fun dynamic out of a whirlwind romance comic book but focus less on plot than we do on detail. It's not bogged down by narrative, instead forming a canvas for the screenwriter to project his own creativity and personal tastes through a stream of movie references, oddball characters, and spats of interesting dialogue. It feels almost improvisational how characters can drop in and out at will, leaning on unusually star-heavy cameo and bit performances from major stars (including a magnetic Gary Oldman and a classic verbal slapdown between Christopher Walken and Dennis Hopper). \n\nI think the film was likely considered much more creative in its own time, before Tarantino began to get sizable budgets to see his own ideas through with minimal studio interference, but True Romance still has plenty of entertainment value and innovation for its age.

Sure, it was featured by other writers on the site before and I've owned it for some time, but somehow I've never found the reason to watch it. Luckily, Arrow Video released several new versions of the film on blu ray and 4K UHD, which gave me the opportunity.\n\nWhat was I waiting for?\n\nTrue Romance was a script Quentin Tarantino sold after Reservoir Dogs and unlike so many of his written work, it was directed by someone else: Tony Scott (ironic, as Tarantino went off on Scott's best-known film Top Gun in the 1994 movie Sleep With Me).\n\nI kind of love that this started with Roger Avery unable to finish a script, so he turned it over to Tarantino, who gave him a stack of pages back which were Natural Born Killers and this movie, which starts after the prison riot and features Mickey and Mallory Knox tracking down the writer who made the cash-in film about their lives. As that writer hides out, he writes True Romance.\n\nTarantino has said that it's his most autobiographical film and by and large, he was happy with the way it turned out. It's pretty faithful to his screenplay, other than changing the story to a linear structure and not the all-over-the-place narrative that Tarantino would use for Pulp Fiction. He also took much of the film's first act from his 1987 effort My Best Friend's Birthday.\n\nI have to say, as a man obsessed with movies that married a short-haired blonde from Detroit, this movie has a lot to say to me.\n\nAs Clarence Worley (Christian Slater) sits alone in a theater watching a Sonny Chiba triple feature, Alabama Whitman (Patricia Arquette) \u2014 named from Pam Grier's character in The Big Bird Cage \u2014 spills her popcorn all over him, leading to an evening where the two bond over cinema, Elvis, diner food and sex.\n\nThe next day, she tells him that she was hired to give him a good time by his boss. He doesn't care; they're both in love. They get married and moments later, Elvis (Val Kilmer) himself appears to Clarence and tells him that he has to set Alabama free from her pimp Drexl (Gary Oldman, perfect for the too brief time he's on screen). All Clarence wants is her to be free, Drexl attempts to kill him, but misjudges just how strong Alabama's love makes the young man. Running into the night with two dead bodies left behind, the young couple learns that they have a briefcase packed with cocaine.\n\nAs we follow the couple to Hollywood, where Dick Ritchie (Michael Rappaport) and Elliot Blitzer (Bronson Pinchot) broker a deal with movie producer Lee Donowitz (Elliot Blitzer; this character produced Bounty Law in Once Upon a Time\u2026In Hollywood, is the son of Donny Donowitz from Inglorious Bastards; the movie that he produced that Clarence speaks so highly of, Coming Home In a Body Bag stars Rick Dalton, who is the hero of Once Upon a Time\u2026In Hollywood; he's also pretty much Joel Silver).\n\nThis drug deal is complicated by the fact that Drexl had stolen the cocaine from Blue Lou Boyle, which sends Vincenzo Coccotti (Christopher Walken) and an army of killers on the trail of Clarence and Alabama. Meanwhile, a cocaine and oral sex aided and abetted arrest leads to the cops wiring Elliot for the big drug deal, an event that leads to a Mexican standoff between our happy couple, the Hollywood elite, organized crime and the police, led by detectives Nicky Dimes (Chris Penn) and Cody Nicholson (Tom Sizemore).\n\nThere's so much that happens in this movie and so much to discuss, but I think it's perhaps best experienced by the viewer. That said, there's an astounding scene between Clarence's father (Dennis Hopper) and Coccotti, as well as Alabama remaining resilient in the face and fists of a hired killer (James Gandolfini). Oh \u2014 and Brad Pitt pretty much inventing the movie Pineapple Express with his scene with the mob interrogating him.\n\nThe original ending had Clarence dying and the widowed Alabama eventually turning to crime. Evidence of that is in Reservoir Dogs and Mr. White (Harvey Keitel) talking about working with Alabama.",

The juxtaposition of the recurring, light-hearted song and bright, Southern California colors (after the plot leaves Detroit) with the noir themes of drugs, prostitutes, pimps, and Mafiosos, gives the film an enjoyable, indulgent style. But it doesn't stop there. We have visions of Elvis (Val Kilmer), brutal dialogue concerning the genetic makeup of Sicilians, and ASMR of guns being loaded. The shootout is great. You root for Clarence (Christian Slater) and Alabama (Patricia Arquette). The cast is absolutely stocked: Christopher Walken, James Gandolfini, Gary Oldman, Brad Pitt, Samuel L. Jackson, Dennis Hopper. Oldman as white, dreadlocked-pimp, Drexl Spivey, deserved more screen-time, but that's pretty much always the complaint about Oldman \u2014 we just don't get enough of him. True Romance is a solid movie, if not over-the-top pretty much from the jump. Maybe it was too saturated with stars (at least from a 2021 lens), which created a sensory overload. That being said, this is one of those genre bedrock movies, which you need. You can't have synthesized subgenres without the staples of the genre, and True Romance is a staple of all that shit we love about places like Detroit and Los Angeles, pink Cadillacs included.",

I knew Slater, Arquette, and Gandolfini were featured but my jaw kept dropping lower as the opening credits rolled, showcasing one recognizable name after another.\n\nThis has plenty of the gritty action feel you expect from Scott, blended with the violence and offbeat humor associated with Tarantino. What I didn't expect was the level of commitment to the actual romance, which was the prime motivator for nearly all of the two main characters actions, and therefore never kept far from the viewers minds.\n\nI could highlight so many of these performances but it is always a treat to see Gandolfini for the first time again. Saul Rubinek was good enough for a mention in his supporting role too.\n\nEdit: Total brain slip in failing to mention the amazing Hans Zimmer score, which is heavily responsible for creating the pleasing tone of this film.\n\nSamuel L. Jackson Binge: Jackson had a very brief, albeit memorable, appearance and did deliver some good character background on, shall we call them, dietary preferences.\n\nSLJ January #57",

After meeting and falling in love, Clarence kills her pimp while retrieving her personal belongings and accidently absconds with a bag of cocaine.  And so starts their journey to California in Tony Scott's brilliant crime drama True Romance, a brutally violent and relentlessly entertaining film about the depths of love and the thirst for greed.  Written by Quentin Tarantino, the dialogue is brilliant throughout and, as likeable as the two main characters are, the film is stolen by the supporting characters, as unseemly a group of clearly defined and utterly memorable characters that has ever been assembled in one movie.  True Romance is riveting from start to finish.  And you have to love the Hans Zimmer score.",

This script, filled with precise and unusual dialogue, was written by Quentin Tarantino before the release of Reservoir Dogs.   This is part of the strength of this one.   Unlike Quentin's feeling about his script for Natural Born Killers, which he blamed Oliver Stone for ruining, Tarantino liked the late Tony Scott's version of his script.  The visuals are all Scott.   They lack the thoughtful pace and pauses of a Tarantino directed film; that doesn't mean it isn't good-just not Tarantino.    It is fast paced.   It is violent.   The strength of it is also its actors.  Slater is at his best.  Arquette is lovable.   Oldman's politically incorrect and crazy performance is one for the books.   Dennis Hopper is Dennis Hopper, and that is never bad.    Add a young Michael Rappaport and Brad Pitt. James Gandolfini too.   Blink and you'll miss a younger Samuel L. Jackson.  Christopher Walken is at the top of his game. Look out for Chris Penn and Tom Sizemore as a pair of cops.  This film is a winner and holds up more than 20 years later.    The Sonny Chiba, the Elvis, the music love that the script is saturated with are all more enjoyable when you learn Tarantino is the author.",

            "content": "\"You're so cool.\" \n\nTony Scott directs his crime thriller True Romance (1993) with a stylish flair for the dramatic. Scott brings moody lighting, sleek pans, clever edits, and killer action for True Romance's unique appeal. He uses neat slow motion for the action shootouts for emphasis on a character's position to a gun or weapon as opposed to using slow motion for a cool visual choice. I think True Romance may very well be Scott's best film as it's a beautiful romance story, engaging crime drama, and a funny comedy of errors.\n\nQuentin Tarantino's script is complex, placing numerous characters against each other in each scene. He takes a vast flux of characters moving around Detroit and L.A. all to place them in the same room for the finale. His dialogue is all his own for better or worse. His characters will feel like their own people, but never real. His references are too obscure to Tarantino's own tastes to come across as regular people. I still despise how he adores making white characters use the \"n-word\" at will. It feels cheap regardless of context. Thankfully, Tarantino's plot is engaging and intriguing as you never know where the story is heading until the last scene.\n\nChristian Slater is great as a careless hero named Clarence. Patricia Arquette is dreamy as a nervous prostitute turned love interest on the run. True Romance takes clear influence from Bonnie & Clyde, Badlands, Wild at Heart, with Thelma & Louise. Hans Zimmer references Badlands' score for True Romance's theme. It's a flashy film of colorful characters and visceral bloody action. The gunfire will keep you awake at the very least.\n\nDennis Hopper is wonderful as Slater's panicked and concerned father. He gets a brilliant tough guy monologue to go out against the devious and threatening Christopher Walken. Val Kilmer gets two scenes as Slater's imaginary mentor Elvis. His accent and vocal tone sounds identical to Elvis. Gary Oldman transforms into a greasy and sleazy pimp that is unrecognizable. His threatening sequence to Slater in the lamplight is genius acting. James Gandolfini similarly gets a fearsome, violent sequence with Arquette that demonstrates his poignant dramatic acting. Brad Pitt is hilarious as the stoner Floyd, who just rips bongs and gives directions the whole movie.\n\nEven Chris Penn and Michael Rapaport get memorable supporting roles alongside the aforementioned greats. True Romance is just a collection of brilliant character actor performances surrounded by gritty violence.",

The director Tony Scott fails to comprehend Tarantino's script and as a result this love bash feels effortful and messy. But I wouldn't just blame Scott to make sense in a film so teenage-ish as such. Not that we haven't had good films in such genre, it's just that the goofiness isn't motivated as those films do and are. And Tarantino is to be put on trial too. Maybe, if he was there, in the director's seat, he might have carved it out in one rhythmic beat. Even though the script and the characters journey might constraint it. The best thing film does is not feeling obligated to explain the falling in love aspect of these characters.\n\nIt is instant. Either it happens or not and when it does, that is it. There's no clause, no explanation and no boundary. Now, in a film that is basically a chase scene, it is extremely bold and outrageous for Scott to expect us to have a conversation. That liberty comes only when the rush is dragged and not pushed by the film. To a script that zooms its way out, Scott had to focus not only on the stops, the stillness of the storyline but also on the emergencies.\n\nOn performance objective, the cast is a topsy-turvy dream. Samuel L. Jackson, Gary Oldman, James Gandolfini, Brad Pitt and Christopher Walken are supporting the lead in the form of guest appearances. But what still works, is those same little delights of chocolates that we receive periodically in the film fooling us in believing that it is in safe hands. True Romance is another product that came out from Tarantino's press that communicates with young couple with a robust argument and his signature ruffian violence.",

With a who's who of Hollywood actors and actresses it's no surprise that even the supporting roles left you with something to remember. The late James Gandolfini was my personal favorite playing the role of Virgil. He's a brooding gangster who looks like he's about to snap in every single scene that he's in. You hate him, yet you appreciate his ruthlessness at the same time.\n\nBeginning: 10\nThe film gets off to a very intriguing start in its first ten minutes. Clarence Worley (Christian Slater) and Alabama Whitman (Patricia Arquette) get off to a fast start that ultimately sets the tone for the rest of the film. You're given a small taste of what's to come which makes you want more.\n\nCharacters: 10\n\nCinematography/Visuals: 7\n\nConflict: 10\n\nGenre: 10\n\nMemorability: 9\n\nPace: 10\n\nPlot: 10\n\nResolution: 10\nMy wife and I went back and forth on this. She thought the ending was improbable. I thought that, considering the rest of the movie as a whole, the ending was exactly what it needed to be. Their entire relationship was improbable so the insanity of how the movie concludes was the improbable cherry on top. Well done.\n\nOverall: 96\nTrue Romance is one of those films you don't expect to like, then you end up loving it. The awesome gun battle at the end is not only absolute bedlam, but it one of those scenes you remember for a long time. You won't forget it, nor will you forget Christopher Walken's intense interrogation scene. I can see now why this film made an all-time Top 100 list.",

Yes, people are huge fans of this and consider it a cult classic and the script is written by Quentin Tarantino since he did his directing debut on Reservoir Dogs and he also write the script for it. True Romance has it's Quentin Tarantino style to the story and the directing style is by Tony Scott even it had some violence that are intense are really enjoyable. It had a huge cast in this. Christian Slater and Patricia Arquette are Clarence Worley and Alabama Whitman, the two couple who are married after going to the movies to watch a kung fu film. Dennis Hopper plays Clarence's father. Val Kilmer plays an Elvis Presley apparition who is a conscience to Clarence like he is on his mind because Clarence an Elvis Presley fanatic. And then we have Gary Oldman as the pimp, Drexl, who Alabama used to work with. Even if I've heard of this movie cause' I'm a fan of old stuff, the realistic violence is got to be the highlight of the film. I just love s**t like that. As it is, the film is a cult favourite for the people and it kind of reminds them of the film made by Quentin Tarantino because of the stylish look of violence. What more can I say? It's Quentin Tarantino's script. I love True Romance, it's tremendous.",

It starts out in savage Detroit, a post-industrial wasteland where Sonny Chiba movies and comic books pass for culture and art. Clarence falls in love with Alabama, a whore with a heart of gold, and, in killing her pimp, he finds himself in possession of a suitcase of cocaine. While gangsters chase them, they race to Hollywood to find a buyer for the drugs amidst wealthy film producers. Quentin Tarantino wrote the screenplay and it includes many of his obsessions like kung fu movies, pulp paperback criminals, and brilliant dialogue. The Detroit setting is purely literary, an homage to one of Tarantino's biggest influences, Elmore Leonard, who set many of his crime novels there including The Switch, a copy of which a young Tarantino was once apprehended stealing from a Kmart. When the film moves to Los Angeles the setting is equally vividly portrayed with a cast of stoners and wannabe actors and rich film producers. There's a tremendous amount of acting talent from Patricia Arquette to Samuel L. Jackson, Dennis Hopper to Christopher Walken. But ultimately it's the romanticism of the two lovers on the run that make this such a great film, particularly as expressed through the eloquent voice over of the young woman, Alabama.",

Revisiting \"True Romance\" is always a lot of fun, and the fan-edited \"Tarantino Cut\" - which sees Tarantino's structure for the film meticulously restored - is a really intriguing way to re-examine this film.  Tony Scott, by Tarantino's own assessment, did a fine job of filming pretty much everything Tarantino wrote in his screenplay, but structured the story in a more conventional manner than he would have preferred.  The re-edit works because there are now more builds and revelations throughout the narrative.  With the exception of a few additional Christopher Walken scenes - which are really superfluous and diminish the impact of his iconic scene with Dennis Hopper - this fan-made cut is really worth watching.  The alternate ending (which was available as a DVD extra on the original cut) makes for interesting consideration and is arguably more realistic, but not necessarily as satisfying as that of the theatrically released version.\n\nTarantino was at the top of his game when he wrote this film, creating numerous memorable characters and scenes - at the top of the list of which remains the now classic interrogation scene between Walken's haughty gang boss and Hopper's protective cop-father.  Gary Oldman is completely astounding as the would-be black pimp / drug boss Drexl.  Christian Slater and Patricia Arquette are utterly charming.  James Gandolfini's career was effectively started by his wonderful performance in his single scene as a hired hitman.    \n\n\"True Romance\" is *almost* too violent, but straddles those fine lines between gratuitousness, glorification and impactful serving of the narrative with a deft and stylish hand.  It is a uniquely grim, comic, violent and sweet film, replete with great characters played by perfectly cast actors and an undulating pace which gradually builds to a wonderfully chaotic climax.  Whichever version you watch, \"True Romance\" remains one of the great modern black comedies of hollywood, its explosive excesses handled adeptly by Tony Scott, who with Quentin Tarantino's singularly sharp screenplay ,created a classic film of the 1990's.",

            "content": "Knowing this film was written by Tarantino, it was a no-brainer that it would be violent and rich in dialogue. It also seemed like a strange title since Tarantino has never directed a romance story, and this movie is only devoted to the titular romance at certain moments. Rather than focusing on the actual romance, this film primarily focuses on the aftermath of Clarence's decision to \"rescue\" Alabama from her pimp. What I mean by this is that the movie is driven by the fact that people are after Clarence once he steals some cocaine as well as by Clarence's sense of freedom by sitting on a fortune as long as he sells the coke. The romance is something that compliments this story.\n\nWhen the romance is actually given attention in the film it proves to be interesting. Clarence learns that Alabama is a prostitute who his boss had hired to show Clarence a good time on his birthday, and this makes no difference to his feelings for Alabama. She is touched that he genuinely had a good time with her - the greatest time he has had with a girl in his whole life. Sex is not the deciding factor here; Clarence loves Alabama for who she is, what she loves, her comforting presence. Perhaps this is the meaning of the title - the romance is formed regardless of the situation of how the two met. The two are together throughout the movie, but it is a shame that most of the film focuses on the crime Clarence becomes involved in rather than the dynamics of this relationship.\n\nThis movie is made up of a stellar cast, and it is a shame that a good amount of recognizable names are only in the film very briefly. Though Tarantino only wrote this film we see a lot of faces found in films which he directed: Brad Pitt, Samuel L Jackson, Christopher Walken, and Chris Penn. Christian Slater as Clarence is a perfect fit for the role though he is not a well-known actor. He adds great personality to Clarence who is a true Tarantino character, defined by his taste in pop culture, as well as just a touch of craziness to make his desperation believable.\n\nPerhaps it is because this film is directed by Tony Scott and not Tarantino, but True Romance is a decent story which lacks Tarantino-level energy, especially in its action sequences. True Romance is a fun experience if you keep in mind it is a screenplay by Tarantino in his early days.\n\n3.0/4.0",

They go to a diner and flirt with each other. At Clarence's apartment they have sex. She confesses that she is a call girl hired by Clarence's boss as his birthday present. Each claims to have fallen in love and they marry and express their commitment with one another by getting tattoos. An apparition of Elvis Presley (Val Kilmer) tells Clarence that killing her pimp will make the world a better place. Clarence visits Alabama's pimp, Drexl Spivey (Gary Oldman), who makes Clarence uneasy. Clarence tells Drexl that he has married Alabama and she has no additional business with him. Drexl and Clarence fight, Clarence draws a gun and kills Drexl. He grabs a bag that he assumes contains Alabama's belongings (which in fact contains drugs that Drexl's peddling). Later Clarence and Alabama go to see Clarence's estranged father, Clifford Worley (Dennis Hopper), a former cop. Clifford tells Clarence that the police assume Drexl's murder is a drug-related killing, and that the cocaine belonged to Irish mob boss \"Blue Lou\" Boyle. In Los Angeles, the young couple plan to meet Clarence's old friend, Dick Ritchie (Michael Rapaport), an aspiring actor. Back in Detroit, Clifford is confronted in his home by Don Vincenzo Coccotti (Christopher Walken), Boyle's consul in the Detroit Mafia, who wants the drugs taken from Drexl. Clifford refuses to reveal where his son has gone. Coccotti shoots Clifford in the head and then finds a note on the fridge giving Clarence's address in L.A...\n\nTony Scott\u00b4s (RIP) \"True Romance\" with a script filled with pop culture references from Quentin Tarantino is a violent ride with larger than life characters and with a hint of Bonnie and Clyde in Clarence and Alabama. When re-seeing it today it\u00b4s so very stylistically and aesthetically in the line of what became Tony Scott\u00b4s slightly over the top trademark of filmmaking. It\u00b4s a gritty, dynamic, bloody and amoral road movie with a large ensemble cast. It\u00b4s shameless in its exploitation of excessive violence and personally I wasn\u00b4t all that impressed when I re-saw it the other day. The fight between Alabama and Virgil is just too much to be honest. Despite the fact that we get solid performances from everyone involved (who will forget Gary Oldman\u00b4s Drexl) the storyline isn\u00b4t all that exciting nor logic in many ways and I reckon the film would\u00b4ve been far better off with the alternative ending as that would\u00b4ve fit the film much more. I reckon time has made me feel different about this sort of films and I have grown a tiredness of Tarantino\u00b4s ultra violence over time. At least when the story isn\u00b4t engaging and just seem to exploit violence. Compared to for example \"Inglourious Basterds\" which I still reckon as one of Tarantino\u00b4s best.",

            "content": "It's hard to watch \"True Romance\", based on an early Tarantino script, and not compare it slightly unfavorably with the films he would personally go on to direct from his own scripts, but really, Tony Scott did a pretty great job with the script, and while it's no \"Pulp Fiction\", \"True Romance\" is an electric action-comedy-drama, full of cracking performances and Tarantino's signature pop-culture-laden dialogue and ridiculous - and ridiculous bloody - action sequences. \n\nWhat a cast this film has, though! There are so many intricacies to all the great performances, but it's better to just list them with a basic description, because there are so many awesome actors on show here that I couldn't possibly talk about all of them in a concise manner. In the center we have Christian Slater and Patricia Arquette as a comic book store cashier Clarence and the call girl, Alabama, he marries, respectively, who find themselves on the run after he kills her ex-pimp (Gary Oldman) out of pure spite (well, it was kinda self-defense). The murder isn't really the reason they have to go on the run; Clarence accidentally grabbed a bag full of uncut cocaine when he meant to grab Alabama's belongings, and now the drug lord, Vincenzo, played by Christopher Walken, wants his coke back. First he tortures Clarence's dad (Dennis Hopper, in my personal favorite performance in the film), and then he sends a goon, Virgil, played by James Gandolfini, to Los Angeles to find them. \n\nBut the cast doesn't stop there; we're not even half-way yet. Also important are Dick (Michael Rapaport), an actor friend of Clarence's, and Elliot Blitzer (Bronson Pinchot), a friend of Dick's who agrees to help Clarence sell the coke to big-time producer Lee Donowitz (Saul Rubinek). Then there's Chris Penn and Tom Sizemore as two cops who attempt to catch Donowitz making the drug deal, and Val Kilmer as the ghost of Elvis Presley, a phantom that hangs over Clarence's shoulder in certain scenes to provide advice. To top it all off, there are some great minor roles played by Samuel L. Jackson, only really in a cameo here as a friend of Alabama's pimp, Brad Pitt, who plays Dick's stoner roommate, and Eric Allan Kramer - the goddamn dad from \"Good Luck Charlie\" - as one of Donowitz' bodyguards. Seriously, that guy has not aged in 20 years. And I include his balding hairstyle in that. \n\nThat astounding cast - and I'm only scratching the surface as there are tons of other great one- or two-line characters who steal their scenes - is the main reason to watch \"True Romance\", though anyone who's a fan of Tarantino's dialogue-and-death style will have a whale of a time here as always. The editing and cinematography aren't quite as hyper-stylized as in Tarantino's own films, but Tony Scott did a solid job of turning yet another masterful QT script into an excellent movie. \n\n\"True Romance\" is a brutal, witty, and ridiculous thriller, with quite a few elements that I found to be totally stupid. Fortunately, that's kind of the point. Why should the characters we're rooting for be logical, when we're rooting for murders and other kinds of criminals in the first place? It's for our benefit as the audience that they make stupid decisions (yes, half of this bollocks could've been avoided had the characters made better choices, and I'm not just talking about NOT murdering or stealing, but they way they react to those situations),  because those stupid decisions lead them into even stupider action sequences, which are yet more excuses to see some of the best actors of our day have a blast beating and shooting each other up in the bloodiest fashion possible. It's a phenomenal experience.",

If it were a person, it would proudly state that it lives in the United States of America and, chances are, it would probably be a hormonal 15-year old boy.  This might suggest that it is a shallow film, but as it is Quentin Tarantino's first major screenwriting job, the shallow attributes are lovably shallow rather than stupefying.\n\tTarantino's mind, I assume, resembles a glorified exploitation movie theater, bursting at the seams with Kung-Fu triple features and Spaghetti Westerns, rockabilly music drifting in the background of the foyer.  \"True Romance\" is a chase movie on crack, exploitative in its violence but charmingly energetic in its dialogue and its acting; it's unbalanced, sometimes off-putting and sometimes gloriously enjoyable.\n\tThe true romance on display rests on the shoulders of Clarence Worley (Christian Slater) and Alabama Whitman (Patricia Arquette), who marry after a whirlwind night surrounded by movies and bedsheets.  Clarence is a comic-book nerd, a friendless average Joe who celebrates his birthday every year by watching a series of Sonny Chiba vehicles; Alabama, in serious contrast, is a prostitute, or, as she puts it, a call girl for the last three days.  They're a mismatch made in heaven, he with his skinny, badly-postured mannerisms and she with her red lipstick, beach-blonde hair, and seedy fur coats.\n\tThough he's euphoric knowing that he's finally found Mrs. Right, Clarence simply cannot ease into domestic bliss knowing that Alabama's pimp (Gary Oldman) is still sneaking around, possibly looking for her.  So, after a long-winded and seriously violent confrontation, he kills him, steals his suitcase of cocaine, and hits the road, his wife in tow.  \n\t\"True Romance\" is directed by Tony Scott and stars Christian Slater, and those are the most prominent obstacles the film encounters in its explosive 120 minutes.  When directing, Tarantino generally makes his violence comically bloody, silly even; Scott, on the other hand, doesn't have the same tongue-in-cheek attitude his writer does in terms of bloodletting, not always lining up with Tarantino's cavorting screenplay.  The sequence in which Alabama is ruthlessly beat up by one of her dead pimp's associates is so disturbingly brutal that it mismatches the splintery, witty writing of the earlier scenes.  Slater, while decent enough to be a distraction instead of a film destroyer, is miscast.  His acting is too calculated, too cautious.  In a film so unhinged, the lead must be just as unhinged; thank goodness for Arquette, Gary Oldman, and Christopher Walken, who are all tremendous, and, yes, unhinged.\n\tThat's what makes \"True Romance\" so frustrating.  60% worth consists of absolutely brilliantly realized conversations, traveling with the ease of a continuous meet-cute; but the other 40% is composed of heinous violence that doesn't quite match the lurid wink of the remaining 60%.\n\tThe violence is almost forgivable, but when you find yourself with a clearer image of Dennis Hopper getting his hand sliced open by one of Walken's henchman than Clarence and Alabama's initial meeting, it's much too difficult.  But when \"True Romance\" is good, it's truly exceptional; there is a reason why so many consider it to be a classic of '90s cinema.  Some might praise it for its climactic shoot-em-up, some might root for Clarence and Alabama's unconventional romance, and some might get a kick out of its dialogue.  There's something for everybody, but one out of those three people will have a hard time consuming it all with no questions asked.",

Watching this film made me feel like watching two films at the same time - a postmodern \"Tarantino flick\" at its purest form full of the dedicated love for cinema, seemingly-nonsense-but-utterly-abstract-with-full-implication dialogues (\"The Sicilian talk\" may be among the best Tarantino conversation ever!), idiosyncratic characters with brief presence yet huge influence to the plot and the audience (this film involved many big names, at their best of acting capabilities and appearance - including the magnificent Christopher Walken, Dennis Hooper, and the devilish Gary Oldman, for \"cameo\" roles but they were actually needed because those \"small\" roles were so epic that they needed real actors to deliver the roles), and of course ingenious plot with a web of complicated and wonderfully entertaining connections and coincidences; the other film is a pure Tony Scott action film with the melancholic flavour of a 80s-ish film full of catchy and unforgettable music (Hans Zimmer is the best! - he did indeed win an Oscar next year for the epic \"The Lion King\"), extravaganza and symbolic action sequences with ... flying feathers (reminded me a lot of John Woo at his helm!), unrestrained violence (why action films these days have to be PG-13 instead being a true action one like \"True Romance\"), and of course the lighthearted comedic tone, which was refined with Tarantino superb conversation. As such, this film can be watched as both a no-brainer choice for pure entertainment or an essential study on Tarantino style and on 80s culture and cinema. Opening a new year with this film is really a delightful experience, and boys, Boyhood's Patricia Arquette was at her very, very best, acting-wise and beauty-wise, in this film.",

            "content": "There are 2 simple reasons that I didn't connect with True Romance and I have no interest in watching it again. The first of which is the lack of any likable characters. Even the \"protagonists\" of the film are kind of despicable, and so I am not invested in seeing them succeed. And what am I supposed to be rooting for them to do? Successfully murder a ton of people and sell a boatload of cocaine? I can deal with anti-heroes just fine, but there really isn't anything heroic about these people. They're just slightly less evil than the other drug dealers, hit-men, and pimps that surround them. I guess because there's a love story to open the film we are expected to see the virtue of the two leads, but it was a manufactured love story between a prostitute and a schizophrenic who speaks to Elvis, so that didn't really click with me.\n\nThe other big shortcoming I found in True Romance is the cast. \"What?!\", you may be thinking, \"This is a star-studded cast!\" You're right, and that's why I didn't give this movie a 1-star rating, because some of these scenes are spectacular thanks to the actors in them, but follow me for a moment: Guess who's a great actor...Samuel L. Jackson. Guess how many scenes he's in...1. Guess who else is a great actor...Gary Oldman. Guess how many scenes he's in...2. Guess who else is a great actor...Christopher Walken. Guess how many scenes he's in...1, so you get the idea. Now guess who are the worst actors in the movie...Christian Slater, Patricia Arquette, Bronson Pinchot, Michael Rapaport, and basically everyone else who is in 50% or more of the movie. I love so many of the talented actors and they absolutely nail the 1 or 2 scenes they are featured in, but even the finest Filet Mignon is going to be hard to enjoy if you're chasing each bite with a can of SPAM. It makes the film almost painful for me to watch. \"Oh, man, I love this guy! Wait, did he seriously just die?!\" True Romance is a heaping helping of potential that someone just crapped all over. I'd love to watch the handful of amazing scenes again in the future, as long as I can fast forward between them.",

The performances are pitch perfect as well including Christian Slater, Patricia Arquette  (who is cute as hell), Gary Oldman (I'd say one of his best roles), Michael Rapaport, Val Kilmer (who is basically Elvis), James Gandolfini (who is at his absolute best here), and Brad Pitt (Who's character is stoned out of his mind throughout the whole film). This is a very fun film that has a fantastic setting, some great comedic moments, and explodes into an orgy of violence at the end (what a spectacular finale).

Slater plays Clarence Worley, a Travis Bickle-type loner who's pre-occupied with Elvis and Kung Fu movies. One night, a sexy call girl named Alabama (Arquette in her breakthrough performance) falls into his lap and before sunrise, the two are madly in love. Clarence confronts Alabama's pimp (a dread-locked Gary Oldman), which turns ugly. Clarence makes off with a suitcase of Alabama's posessions, only to discover that it instead contains a large amount of cocaine. The two young lovers head off to LA to try and sell the dope, unaware that cops and gangsters are on their trail. This all makes for an inevitable Mexican stand-off in true Tarantino fashion. This film has everything. Slater and Arquette are perfectly cast as the heroes, Oldman is brilliant despite limited screen time, while Walken and Hopper have arguably the films best scene in a one-on-one showdown of acting. A pre-Sopranos Gandolfini shines as a phylisophical sociopath, Brad Pitt has scene-stealing work as a scuzzy dope-fiend, and also look for dependable pro's like Tom Sizemore, Saul Rubinek and an un-seen Val Kilmer, who appears as Elvis' ghost, dispursing advice to Clraence at critical junctures. Overall, this is a treat from beginning to end, and works even better with repeated viewings. About as good as it gets for the capabilities of 90's Hollywood.",

Surprisingly, especially to a fan like me, the only person who didn't bring their A game was Hans Zimmer. His score was great at most parts, but sometime (and a bit too often too) it felt just wrong. For instance during a shootout, the music felt like I was watching It's A Wonderful Life. However it's all nitpicking in a superb film. 5/5",

            "content": "*THE OFFICIAL BETTER THAN JUNO SEAL*\n\nQuentin Tarantino is most commonly known for reinventing film in general.  His script for Pulp Fiction defied all laws of film and is considered by most to be the greatest script ever written.  However, a year before he released Pulp Fiction, he wrote the script for True Romance, a genre bending wild ride filled with very intriguing performances and some very funny dialogue. \n\nPeople tend to think, oh, this is that one film that was written by Tarantino, but directed by someone else (though that someone is an established director).  What they forget to mention, is that this film is actually better than most, if not all his films.  Yeah, it is pretty violent.  Yeah, it does get cheesy at points, but they all enhance the experience for this film.  It truly makes for an entertaining fest of guns, romance, and just Tarantino.\n\nI am not the biggest fan of Tony Scott, granted he has made some fun films, like Unstoppable.  However, here his direction is actually good!  It's nicely shot in that 90s crime format that I love so much.  And he expertly handles the cheesy love moments well along with the bloody, over the top action scenes along with the humor.  It's his best film to date, and I really felt he had talent.  \n\nThe best moments of the film focus more on Clarence's borderline obsession with Elvis Presley.  These moments can be comical, and trust me, they are so funny.  But these reveal a lot about Clarence himself.  He's a good hearted man, but he's too hotheaded to think straight.  At times, he lets his emotions get the best.  In fact, had he not been so emotional, the events of the film wouldn't happen.  The Elvis Presley moments are some of the best moments in the film....Not to mention Val Kilmer plays it excellently.\n\nThe acting in this film is phenomenal.  Christian Slater, who's been on a huge slump, is fit to play the role of Clarence.  He's got that thing where he can talk slickly and act cool, but when you notice what he's saying, you realize he's a creep.  Yeah, that kinda thing.  Christopher Walken is in the film for a short 10 minutes, but those 10 minutes were the greatest 10 minutes ever....Not to mention he was in the scene with Dennis Hopper.  Two great actors, one great scene.  Brad Pitt comes in as a stoner, but he's more of a side character, but he's very likable and I think Chase Nyland would enjoy his moments.  Samuel L. Jackson has a small cameo as a random gangsta who, quote-on-quote, \"loves to eat pussy.\"  Oh, and there's Gary Oldman, who I did not recognize until afterward.  He plays a wigger that is the root of the problem, and yeah, he's amazing.  If you don't like the film, you must admit, there is some top notch acting going on.  \n\nLots of people think Tarantino's name can help a bandwagon, but they're wrong.  There have been blunders on Tarantino's account that I cannot forget.  However, with True Romance, he hits the nail on the head.  He writes a wonderful script, filled with likable characters and moments of pure awe.  I can see why people would think that this film is just some random love film, with action scenes.  And some people might hate that.  However, since I grew up on romance films, I've had a personal bond to them.  And seeing Tarantino make a parody of them, makes me feel right at home.  I guess I had so much fun with pointing out the romance tropes that Tarantino and Scott were making fun of, that I would feel bad if I didn't give this a 10/10.  It truly deserves it....\n\nAlso, points for the name, which is a play on all the cheesy, sappy romance books/films on the 50s.",

Thanks to a sharp and witty script and entertaining characters True Romance was extremely cool. The best way I can describe this film is to take Patricia Arquette's character's words and sound like a broken record: all I could think of while watching this film was Quentin Tarantino you are so cool; Tony Scott you are so cool; every single actor in this film you are so cool, True Romance you are so cool. I can't believe I had to wait 21 years to get around to watching this considering how big of a Quentin Tarantino fan I am (and I'm also a huge fan of Tony Scott's work in Man on Fire). Tarantino's energetic script and Scott's stylized direction blended perfectly in this near masterpiece. The cast is absolutely brilliant here and there are so many memorable characters and scenes in this film. I think I enjoyed this film more watching it for the first time now than if I would have seen it in 1993 considering there are so many familiar faces that I probably wouldn't have recognized back then. Brad Pitt, Val Kilmer, Dennis Hopper, Gary Oldman, Christopher Walken, Samuel L. Jackson, James Gandolfini, and Chris Penn all have small but memorable roles. Oldman is barely recognizable playing a pimp with dreadlocks and a glass eye, but it is a unique performance. Christian Slater and Patricia Arquette give the performance of their careers here; it's a shame Slater has been in so many terrible films in the past decade because his performance here was promising. Arquette is adorable as Alabama and I can't think of another sweeter performance than hers. There is so much energy and charm in this film that it's hard to resist. Like good wine, True Romance will probably age better over time considering I couldn't believe how much fun I was having watching an early 90's film for the first time. True Romance you are so cool!\n\nClarence Worley (Christian Slater) is a comic book store clerk who also happens to be a martial arts film buff. He plans to spend his birthday as he always does, at the movies, watching a triple feature of Sonny Chiba. What he doesn't expect is that he will find the love of his life there. While he is watching the film, a pretty woman walks into the theater spilling her popcorn all over him. She apologizes and introduces herself as Alabama (Patricia Arquette). The two fall in love with each other after she opens up to him about her true identity. This leads them through a series of dangerous adventures involving pimps (Gary Oldman), the Sicilian mafia (Christopher Walken, James Gandolfini), drug dealers (Samuel L. Jackson), police officials (Chris Penn, Tom Sizemore), and Hollywood producers (Saul Rubinek, Bronson Pinchot). The film is full of energy and thrills as the two lovers face several obstacles along the way. Thankfully, Clarence seems to have a mentor on his side to guide him: an apparition of his idol Elvis Presley (Val Kilmer) who is sort of his conscious.\n\nEven if you aren't a huge fan of Tarantino you could still enjoy True Romance for all the beloved actors in this film that weren't probably big Hollywood names back then. The film moves so quickly and the script is so energetic that It makes for a very entertaining watch. There are so many memorable scenes in this film, like the face off between Gary Oldman and Christian Slater, the group mexican standoff, and the violent hotel scene involving Gandolfini and Arquette, but the real scene stealer would have to be the one in which Dennis Hopper, who plays Clarence's father, is ambushed by Christopher Walken and his gang and they have a not so friendly chat about Sicilians. It was a pure Tarantino moment and there are a lot of these great dialogues that allow for the film to have such a great pace and move along so nicely. The style and characters in this film make it such a unique experience and film lovers will enjoy the Hollywood satire as well. I am so glad I finally got to see this wild and romantic film. This is another reason why Tony Scott will be missed.",

The client, Clarence (Christian Slater) then attacks her pimp, played with glorious zest by Gary Oldman, and accidental steals a suitcase full of drugs. The story then moves to include Clarence's father and ex-police offer Clifford, played surprising straight by the great Dennis Hopper. The drugs then attract the attention of the mob led by Vincenzo (Christopher Walken). With all that going on, we head out west to Hollywood, where the suitcase of drugs brings together a big Hollywood producer, the local police and everybody I already mentioned - all to a single hotel room! And everyone is packing! Oh, and I almost forgot to mention a hilarious turn by Brat Pitt as Floyd as Dick Ritchie's (Michael Rapaport) permanently stoned room-mate. Oh oh, and Val Kilmer (though you never actually see his face) plays a mystical Elvis mentor to Clarence!\n\nThe romance shouldn't feel real. But it does. The story should feel contrived. But it doesn't. It is however, very cool. As Alabama tells Clarence near the end of the film 'You're so cool.' This film is as slick as Elvis in his hey day. It even gyrates at a kingly pace to a superb soundtrack. Christian Slater and Patricia Arquette make a great Bonnie and Clyde style couple, and they are supported by the best! Every single scene with Brat Pitt is hilarious. James Gandolfini's turn as a mob enforcer/hit-man is superb. Gary Oldman's dread-locked pimp Drexl is both shocking and amazing. It all comes together thanks to Quentin Tarantino's unrestrained story and script, which turns out to be a perfect match for Tony Scott's rock-a-roll style direction.\n\nMovie Prep:\n\nIf you've enjoyed other movies written by Tarantino you'll probably find this entertaining too. It hops about a bit, and it's very violent at times. The plot is pretty simple and easy to follow too. I would say if you are sold on the opening act, and believe in the romance between Clarence and Alabama. You'll be very happy you watched this film.\n\nBest Format:\n\nThe film looks great. Kind-a-has a warm sunset glow to it. If your local theater were screening this certainly try to see this on the big screen. At home a HD viewing is recommended.\n\nBest moment for me: >\n\nThe absolute best scene in the movie for me is the conversation between Vincenzo and Clifford. Clifford knows who he's dealing with, and figures his time is up. Vincenzo has just finished talking about how Sicilians are great liars. So Clifford educates Vincenzo on some Sicilian history. The dialog has some colorful language so I'll let you explore that on your own. But trust me, it's priceless!\n\n-> http://www.TalkieGazette.com\n\n-> http://www.facebook.com/talkiegazette\n\n-> http://www.twitter.com/talkiegazette",

Perhaps that's simply because I'm a fanboy and used to his oft self-indulgent and slower style, which wasn't present here. I imagine Tony Scott wanted to keep things moving. Which doesn't detract from the quality, it all its rather fitting here; it's an adventure that's exhilarating and never relents. There's some touching romance here (obviously) which works because of the writing and the chemistry of the two leads. The film features two extraordinary cameos which set up probably the best scenes in the film. Overall, it's a fairly lighthearted film, with smatters of black comedy, it just lacks some of the punch of other Tarantino films. However being a Tarantino film, it leaves you with the impression a second viewing would do nothing but improve upon your enjoyment experienced the first time around.",

            "content": "(*** )  True Romance is a Tony Scott film, but is probably best known for being written by Tarantino.  The auteur voice of Tarantino is certainly visible in the writing style, but this film is a bit more quirky than most of his offerings, which is part of why I like it.  I feel that  had Tarantino directed this film, it would have been more blunt and dark, but the direction of Tony Scott seemed to perfectly bring out the witty and light-hearted aspects of the story, making it all the better.  Often times this is due to the off-beat score, which can make the most intense moments seem somehow relatable.  Truth be told, if I met Clarence or any of his friends in real life, I would hate (and probably fear) them with a passion.  The strength of this film is somehow making me sympathize with the emotions of a complete psycopath and his insane lady.  Not to mention making me laugh out loud at times where it normally would have seemed inconceivable to do so.\n\nEssentially this is a Bonnie and Clyde type tale which first makes us love a couple then throws them into the bowels of the crime world.  It almost feels like a Coen brothers style of story-telling, where moronic laymen are thrown in way over their head.  Of course this is done with great monologues and a gleeful disregard for human life.  The stylized violence of a Tarantino film is certainly there, but it is a bit more hurtful than in many of the films he directed.  You really feel the pain and loss rather than just marveling at it.  So if I love the direction so much why didn't I rate it higher than other films of Quentin's?  Simply because it isn't as good of a story.  This one came early in his career and showed up when he was more about making fun interesting movies than making an emotional impact.  The film is certainly an anomaly of character motivation, and provides a very unique take on human relationships.  However, it simply isn't a good enough story, and I don't care about the characters or the outcome enough when the final stuff goes down.  Definitely worth a watch, though maybe more for the brilliant acting and dialogue than the story itself.\n\nBy the way I was kind of let down that the two best performances (Oldman and Walken) are very short on screen time.  Boy are they great when we see them though.",

There are no chapters, there's no multiple story-lines that run parallel to one another and interweave to form a perfect bow in the end...It's pretty straightforward: Guy falls in love with Call Girl, kills her pimp, takes his cocaine, and tries to sell it in Hollywood. But, it's the offbeat, Tarantino humor mixed with great dialogue that make this movie. Slater and Arquette as the leading couple are extremely likable and you hope the whole movie that they would get the fairytale ending they deserved. Other notable performances I liked were seeing Brad Pitt as a stoner and Christoper Walken as a Sicilian henchmen (the scene between him and Clarence's dad is one of my favorites.)",

With a great cast of terrific actors, True Romance is a must see crime picture that is sure to delight movie buffs.  This is an exhilarating and highly entertaining film from start to finish that illustrates the brilliant direction of Tony Scott and original writing style that has Quentin Tarantino famous. This is one of the best crime films that I have seen, and the cast itself is one that is sure to delight filmgoers everywhere. Every actor here gives something to the film to make it that much better, and the two leads were great as well. There are some darkly humorous parts here and there to compliment the serious tone of the film, and everything works well enough to keep you engaged from start to finish.  Over the course of his career Tony Scott has made some great films. Forget Top Gun as being his best, it isn't. This is his strongest effort. I feel that he really became a confident director with this movie, and he felt even more comfortable behind his camera. Top Gun was a decent affair, but quite overrated. But True Romance is his masterwork. This is simply put an effectively well directed picture that has a truly unique, crazy plot with a memorable cast of talented actors. Tony Scott and Quentin Tarantino have created something great here, and it delivers a truly awesome film going experience that you soon won't forget. If you come across True Romance, definitely give it a view, you won't be disappointed. Tony Scott would direct much more exhilarating films in terms of pulse pounding action, but they would also be fairly hit and miss. But with True Romance, he uses the basics of a simple plot, and it makes for a much more convincing and enjoyable movie.",

Clarence Worley is the Lloyd Dobler of the 90's. The love story between Alabama & Clarence is classic. A man that would do anything for his wife. That includes killing her pimp, stealing a suitcase full of drugs,  & getting chased by gangsters. All while having Elvis as their guardian angel. This film has many heavy hitters in.

That's because, unlike ''Reservoir Dogs'', ''Inglourious Basterds'', ''Pulp Fiction'' and ''Django Unchained'', there is absolutely nothing remarkable about this film. Nothing to tell, for that matter. It is just an insanely dumb and neverending spectacle of idioticness from the moment it starts going unstoppable without telling a story even. \n\nNo character in this movie is memorable. Not even Christopher Walken's ''Vincenzo Cocotti'': a Sicilian mobster who for a brief time chases the inamoured protagonists. Very funny fact, since Walken looks anything but Sicilian. Performances are unremarkable, and most of the actors make no effort to propel the characters because the characters are just very stupid. Hell, even screenwriting in this movie is wrong. Phrases that were supposed to be memorable are just very dumb occurences. Other than the hilarious ''You want me to suck his dick?!'' and ''I'm sorry, we don't have coke. But don't worry, there's a Pepsi machine down the hall!'', screenwriting in this film is way too forgettable. \n\nTarantino seems to have written a story whose main characters shares too much similarities with himself, but goes on adventurism that couldn't be further from real life. It seems as though Tarantino writes something he would like to happen to him, but then it's not even an effort to make it memorable.\n\nIt is understandable people like this so much because the sole fact it has QT attached to it and it portrays rather too much exploitation than it should care for an intelligent and satisfying work. ''True Romance'' for me is just one of the dumbest movies I've ever seen, and basically two hours of my life I won't get back if it weren't because I intend to study Tarantino's filmography.",

Tarantino wrote the screenplay, but he didn't direct it. You can see his style in the screenplay writing when you watch the film, because of all of the violence, brutality, and foul language. It even has the usual all start cast that he usually has in his films. You can see how it was written by Tarantino, but you can tell that he didn't direct it. It doesn't seem like an older film like the stuff that he directed does. The film doesn't have the indie film style that his films like Pulp Fiction have. That is how you see the difference of what the film is like when he only writes it, and doesn't both direct and write it. The film is about a guy named \"Clarence\" who meets this cute girl named \"Alabama\" and falls in love with her in one night. She confesses to him that she was paid by Clarence's boss to go out with him, because he never gets out, and he wanted Clarence to have a fun time on his birthday. She is a prostitute, but she actually fell for him in that one night. Typical clich\u00e9 that you see in all love stories. Clarence goes and kills her pimp who is portrayed by Gary Oldman. She thinks that was such a romantic thing to do, which I think Tarantino wanted her to have that reaction to make fun of really cheesy romance in older love stories. The type of romance that when you think about it is really awful, and makes you want to spew. But they get married after that. The big conflict is that after he killed the pimp he grabbed what he thought was Alabama's bag, but turned out to be a bag with over 200,000 dollars worth of cocaine. They try to sell it, but the gangsters try to come and get them, because it belongs to them. The film got really crazy and intense in the end, and it was awesome. This was a great movie that was written by Quentin Tarantino, but directed by Tony Scott, that not a lot of people have seen, but they should see if they like Tarantino. I don't really think about Tony Scott directing this film, as you can see by how I don't really talk about him, and I just talk about Tarantino in this film. But Tony Scott did do a great job.

However, the heart of the movie is Clarence and Alabama thanks to the great performances from Christian Slater and Patricia Arquette. Hans Zimmer's memorable score for the film is something that stands out and resonates once the film is over. It adds a bouncy xylophone driven theme to the film and finds the right balance. However, you can talk about \"True Romance\" without mentioning the best scene in the film between Hopper and Walken, one of the best scenes QT has ever written for the silver screen.",

But anyway when Clarence (Christian Slater) a comic book store clerk meets Alabama (Patricia Arquette) they fall in love. But she being a call girl, she brings some baggage along. Namely her pimp Drexel (an exotic looking Gary Oldman). Well a confrontation between Clarence and Drexel turns ugly and soon the lovers are on the run with Drexel's \nassociates in hot pursuit over some stolen drugs. The lovers leave Detroit and head to LA to try and unload the drugs and score some money. Easier said than done..soon hitmen and the LAPD get involved leading to a glorious shoot-out in a ritzy hotel with maximum carnage. This film has one of the most impressive casts you will ever see. In addition to Slater and Arquette, you also have Dennis Hopper as Clarence's dad; Christopher Walker as the main bad guy in pursuit of his employer's drugs; Brad Pitt as a dope head room-mate; Samuel L. Jackson as a drug dealer; James Gandolfini as a brutal hitman; Tom Sizemore and Chris Penn as LAPD and Bronson Pinchot as a Hollywood executive. Plus a cameo by Val Kilmer as Elvis Presley, who is part of Clarence's consciousness. Great movie with a great music theme that plays through out the entire film. A must see. Be warned it's very violent and very profane.   \n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nVirgil: Now the first time you kill somebody, that's the hardest.

The second one... the second one ain't no fuckin' Mardis Gras either, but it's better than the first one 'cause you still feel the same thing, y'know... except it's more diluted, y'know it's... it's better.

This was the first movie written by Quentin Tarantino(Tony Scott directs), and it ranks right up there with his best(well except \"Pulp Fiction\", but that's on a whole different level).  I love this movie.  It's still fresh, original, and exciting after almost 20 years.  It's the story of Clarence(Christian Slater) and his roller coaster relationship with Alabama(Patricia Arquette) a call girl.  When Clarence kills her pimp(Gary Oldman) he accidentally steals a suitcase full of cocaine.  From there he and Alabama head to L.A. while the mafia is after them.  This has one of the craziest casts ever.  Christopher Walken, Chris Pine, Samuel L. Jackson, Dennis Hopper, James Gandolfini, and Brad Pitt, among many others fill out the terrific roster of A level talent.  This movie will make you laugh, cringe at the violence, and probably bring you close to tears towards the end.  It's a true experience of a movie that resonates and stays with you.  I popped this in the other night at around 11 p.m., and didn't intend to finish it, but couldn't stop watching.  It's just riveting, and a movie that makes you glued to the screen.

Slater and Arquette work so well together here its pretty remarkable. The same can go for Christopher Walken and Dennis Hopper who brought us the infamous \"Sicilian Scene\" even though they are barely in the movie the 10min scene they share is the best in the entire movie. With a great soundtrack by Hans Zimmer True Romance's \"You're So Cool\" theme fits beautifully into its surroundings and almost makes you want to cry because of how sadly beautiful this whole thing is.

So I just watched it a couple of nights ago, so here's my review for True Romance.\r\n\r\nPlot: Clarance is a comic book store clerk who meets a woman named Alabama while watching a triple feature in the theaters on his birthday. They seem to hit it off, but after sleeping with each other, Alabama admits that she actually is a call girl who was hired by Clarance's boss as a birthday present to him, but she admits that she actually really is in love with him and he admit that he feels the same for her. So they get married and start to live happily, but then Clarance decides to kill Alabama's pimp, Drexel, who is also a drug dealer so Alabama can be left alone and then steals the coke that Drexel have leaving him and Alabama to plan to go to L.A. to sell it. But they eventually are being chased by a Detroit mafia boss who owns the cocaine that Drexel actually stole.\r\n\r\nMina was totally right. This was a really, really good movie. I mean the story was very well written but it's all the other stuff that really makes this movie interesting. I mean the romance is good...if you like that kind of romance that our modern society likes...which I'm not into, but if you do, you'll probably enjoy it. The action was very well done and was really suspenseful and even really deep at some particular moments. And the casting and acting is awesome. I mean my main issue with this film is that some supporting cast members are not in the film as often as you would love to such as Samuel L. Jackson, and Val Kilmer. But some are there for a decent about of time like Brad Pitt and also Christopher Walken who both did some pretty good jobs. But my favorite performance in the film bar none was Gary Oldman as Drexel. I mean I knew he was a good actor before, but holy cow did he really prove how far he can go into being a completely different person. It was pretty remarkable and I wish I could've seen more for him in particular.\r\n\r\nAnd that's my review for True Romance. It's a well-written and acted romantic crime film filled with an awesome cast, plenty of romance (or at least romance as far as our modern world goes), action-packed and is all around a very good time and I side with Mina that as far as I know, this is probably the best movie that Tony Scott came up with hands down.",

There are a bunch of supporting roles that take up no more than 10 minutes of screen time that are played by Oscar nominated actors. Most importantly, the one scene between Christopher Walken and Dennis Hopper. Unreal. It was bizarre and interesting to see a film written but not directed by Tarantino. You can totally see his stamp on it with the writing but it was clearly directed by someone more versed in action films in the late Tony Scott. It is entertaining all the way through and the best thing I can say about it is there is nothing else quite like it.",

            "content": "This is what a Quentin Tarantino type of love story.  When he thinks of romance it's like this film.  The film is violent, dark, and romantic at times.  Tarantino wrote the screenplay, but he didn't direct it.  You can see his style in the screenplay writing when you watch the film, because of all of the violence, brutality, and foul language.  It even has the usual all start cast that he usually has in his films.  You can see how it was written by Tarantino, but you can tell that he didn't direct it.  It doesn't seem like an older film like the stuff that he directed does.  The film doesn't have the indie film style that his films like Pulp Fiction have.  That is how you see the difference of what the film is like when he only writes it, and doesn't both direct and write it.  The film is about a guy named \"Clarence\" who meets this cute girl named \"Alabama\" and falls in love with her in one night.  She confesses to him that she was paid by Clarence's boss to go out with him, because he never gets out, and he wanted Clarence to have a fun time on his birthday.  She is a prostitute, but she actually fell for him in that one night.  Typical clich\u00e9 that you see in all love stories.  Clarence goes and kills her pimp who is portrayed by Gary Oldman.  She thinks that was such a romantic thing to do, which I think Tarantino wanted her to have that reaction to make fun of really cheesy romance in older love stories.  The type of romance that when you think about it is really awful, and makes you want to spew.  But they get married after that.  The big conflict is that after he killed the pimp he grabbed what he thought was Alabama's bag, but turned out to be a bag with over 200,000 dollars worth of cocaine.  They try to sell it, but the gangsters try to come and get them, because it belongs to them.  The film got really crazy and intense in the end, and it was awesome.  This was a great movie that was written by Quentin Tarantino, but directed by Tony Scott, that not a lot of people have seen, but they should see if they like Tarantino.  I don't really think about Tony Scott directing this film, as you can see by how I don't really talk about him, and I just talk about Tarantino in this film.  But Tony Scott did do a great job.

The movie is all about the romance so it's more effective when we see that right off the bat. The movie is flashy, fun, full of action and has a terrific actor in nearly every single role. Hopper and Walken's scene is the standout for most, Pitt and Oldman also play great characters, and Arquette has never been cuter.",

            "content": "True Romance is the work of two men, known for making movies (as TBS would say) for guys who like movies, and have one of the pick of the litter in the genre from the early to mid nineties. Quentin Tarantino sold his script to fund Reservoir Dogs, and Tony Scott (Top Gun) got picked up to direct. Some have complained that Tarantino should've directed this film, that it's so much his (which I agree with considering the story of the film was taken from his 1987 experimental film My Best Friend's Birthday, which refers to Clarence in this film going to the Sonny Chiba movies) that his own style as a director would've complimented it. It's a nice thought, though that's not what we as the audience are left with, and so with the final product there is much to admire about the style that Scott uses in the film. He films Tarantino's script (from a Roger Avary script originally) very much like he's shooting a Hollywood movie (as he knows how to with DP Jeffrey Kimball), with all the cut-aways and editing timing that is expected in a conventional crime-drama-thriller, then by hearing the snapping dialog from the script, and the cast performing them, Scott does become an important piece of making True Romance a success.\n\nThe story is a throwback to the old 'lovers on the run' formula, among others- Clarence (Christian Slater in one of his finest) is an employee in a comic book store in Detroit, loves kung-fu movies and big guns and such, who gets set up unwittingly with a call girl named Alabama (Patricia Arquette). The two fall in love, and Clarence feels confident enough by a certain voice in the back of his head (provided by Val Kilmer) to go and free Alabama for good from her vile pimp and drug dealer Drexl (Gary Oldman in one of the better villain roles of the time). He does, and through a couple of accidents Clarence and Alabama wind up with millions worth in cocaine, and high-tail it to LA to sell it, as the original (mob) owners of the coke follow after, with explosive results.\n\nFor fans of the actors, in particular the supporting cast, True Romance is one of the treats of treats in modern movies, on par with Pulp Fiction's roster of know-ables: Christopher Walken as a gangster (who would've thought?), Brad Pitt as a stoner roommate, Tom Sizemore and Chris Penn as cops, a few good lines for Samuel L. Jackson, an early plum for James Gandolfini, and my personal favorite of the lot, Dennis Hopper as Clarence's ex-cop father. Another thing that makes True Romance one of the (dare I say) most accessible of Tarantino's works is that a viewer who might not know this is his work on first viewing (this was me a few years ago, sad to say) will stay tuned through the whole thing if it's on TV just because of the star power; indeed, before Oldman's Detrix is introduced into the film, TR seems to flow like it'll be a romantic drama with light overtones. All I can say is by the end of this film, you will see that good taste can prevail no matter how much bloodshed gets on the screen, or how many obstacles get in the way of love (and Elvis!).",

            "content": "After hearing the sad news of director Tony Scott\u00e2??s passing earlier this week I decided to revisit a film of his that has had a considerable impact on the way that I watch films.\n\nIt was the summer of 2002 and I was on a holiday with my school, we were staying at a rather uninspired campsite in France with a few of other schools. One afternoon I found myself wandering the site aimlessly, with all of the ping-pong tables taken I decided to see what was happening in the rec room. Some boys from another school were watching a film, it had been on for about fifteen minutes but there was sufficient violence to hold my teenage interest. I remember being absolutely amazed by what I saw that afternoon; I didn\u00e2??t know films were made like that. I thought all films were Adam Sandler comedies or bad action flicks. I leaned towards the boy sat next to me and asked him what we had just watched, he said \u00e2??True Romance\u00e2??.\n\nWhat I love about this film is that I still get this same buzz when I watch it, it\u00e2??s a film that I can sling on when I don\u00e2??t really know what to watch and each time I come away from finding something new, interesting and inspiring about it. Back then I enjoyed it for its more sensationalist elements but now I see the fantastically built characters, the alluring romantic elements and the subtle beauty of Detroit under snow. I guess these factors were hidden by teenage bloodlust.\n\nThe films ensemble cast is a cinematic treat; with the likes of Dennis Hopper, Gary Oldman and Christopher Walken all gracing the screen we are captivated as they bring a real presence to some original and powerfully written characters. The films dialogue is snappy and memorable, the scene between Vincenzo Coccotti and Clarence\u00e2??s father is a great example of this, the lines flow beautifully and have a little bite to them.\n\nThis was my first exposure to Quentin Tarantino, who wrote the film, little did I know back in 2002 that I would spend much of the following years watching his films religiously. True Romance has Tarantino stamped all over it, featuring many of his signatures; the violence, the pop-culture references and the \u00e2??Mexican stand-off\u00e2?? in the final scene. Tarantino was at one point attached to direct but decided against this, during my \u00e2??Tarantino years\u00e2?? I thought this was a shame, now firmly out the other side I realise that this is a bit of a blessing. Tarantino has said that had he directed he would have used his famed fragmented narrative style and changed the ending; though not Tony Scott\u00e2??s biggest fan I am certainly glad that he got the project.\n\nThe film has a unique feel to it; I can only liken it to Terrence Malick\u00e2??s Badlands. I see a lot of similarities between the two; the love story isn\u00e2??t that dissimilar from that of Kit and Holly, Alabama\u00e2??s narration and Hans Zimmer\u00e2??s fantastic reworking of Carl Orff\u00e2??s Gassenhauer are all striking resemblances.\n\nTony Scott made films like Top Gun and Days of Thunder; fast paced films for entertainment. I guess True Romance is a great example of what a film built for these purposes can achieve by taking these notions and digging a little deeper.",

But at the end of the day, when Quentin Tarantino, who wrote the film and is prone for long continuous shots and off-screen violence, praises Tony Scott for making a better film than Tarantino could have.... You have to agree this was a perfect combination of both directing styles. Tony Scott is almost the exact opposite of Tarantino in regards to style and yet it works in True Romance. It's still a \"Tarantino film\" to movie buffs, but the style makes it unique. Despite the violence which is extremely graphic (particularly when James Gandolfinni beats Patricia Arquette), Scott is able to get far more emotion out of the audience than anything Tarantino did to that point in his career and you feel the \"love story\" that is the movie's core. Ive seen this way too many times, and I still find it underrated. Not my favorite Tony Scott movie.... But it might be his best.",

Thanks to a snappy script by Quentin Tarantino, Scott has no doubt brings a lot of style and substance in one of his finest movies he's ever made...\n\nRead more at http://caseymoviemania.blogspot.com/2012/08/in-memory-of-tony-scott-1944-2012-true.html",

Personally, I thought the dialogue was good at times, but comparing it to some of his other works, it is probably the weakest. What makes this movie is the strong acting, and the endearing nature of the well presented love story. I may be a bit bias, because I am a sucker for \"in over their heads\" type scenarios, but this one definitely delivers. It provides the proper amount of conflict without delving into the realm of outrageousness, while still providing a fantastically over the top ending. That may seem like a contradiction, but I don't know, it just works. \nThe one thing that didn't work was the Elvis hallucination that Clarence experienced throughout the movie. It did indicate that he had a bit of madness in him, but in my opinion, not enough. If you're going to include it fine, just go some direction with it. Instead, his visions of Elvis just became a distraction and interrupted flow. Oh, and on a side-note, the music in this movie set a fantastic mood.",

It's got some ties to his other films. Alabama is mentioned in Reservoir Dogs (it was originally intended that she had a thing with Mr White). And it looks like Inglorious Basterd's Bear Jew Donnie Donowitz has a son on the character list here. \n\nYeah so the title may be a turn off for the target audience of this film.

Well, Tarantino wrote the script, it includes actors Christopher Walken, Gary Oldman, Dennis Hopper, Chris Penn, Val Kilmer, Christian Slater, and Patricia Arquette, it's directed by action movie director Tony Scott, and the characters involved include cops, pimps, drug lords, mobsters, film producers, and hookers. I'd say that make for one good time at the movies.\r\n\r\nTrue Romance is fun, funny, exciting, suspenseful, and of course romantic. The actors all do exceptional jobs especially Gary Oldman who plays a crazed, drug-addled pimp who thinks he's black. So many classic scenes to be found and the characters are all memorable, which is expected from QT.\r\n\r\nRecommended to anyone looking for a fun time.",

Every mention has been made about True Romance, and me, being interested in the set of films Tarantino wrote but didn't direct, I took this one upon me to finish and understand like I did Natural Born Killers. Now mind you, I will be making comparisons between this film and NBK.Natural Born Killers disgusted me the first time I saw it. I couldn't finish it, however, I went back to it and observed and absorbed to discover the meaning behind it all. It made sense and came out as something beautiful to me. TR, I wasn't disgusted, I was just not absorbed as I had been with Natural Born Killers. The interest faded in this film when I was introduced to the characters, whom, I hated. I felt no sympathy for Christian Slater's character, as to me, just seemed like another idiot obsessed with violence. Patricia Arquette, a beauty at the time of the film, annoyed me so much.\n\nNBK was more fleshed out. Your main characters are psychopathic serial killers, yet you have sympathy for them and have the desire for the m to escape or win their situation. \n\nAs I think about it, my real criticism is with the characters. The leads made me want to join Mickey and Mallory and hunt them, a saving grace is the supporting roles of Dennis Hopper,  Christopher Walken and Gary Oldman, in that order. \n\nGive it time, I might come to appreciate this film more, but for now, it gets 2/5 stars for being a shallow film about two people I would like to have killed as did almost every other character that came across them.\n\n\nWeeks later.\n\nThe film has grown on me. Even though the performances of Patricia Arquette and Christian Slater annoy me, I have come to realize the fantastical elements o the film that capture you. As I heard mentioned in another review, this is the male version of Today's Twilight films. The fantasy of running off with a beautiful girl on a get rich quick scheme amidst a cycle of violence. Again, the stand outs of the film are the cameos of Brad Pitt, Dennis Hopper, Chris Walken and Gary Oldman. The soundtrack and leading song of You're So Cool by Hans Zimmer leave something of a happy feeling, as everything fits perfectly. \n\nOriginally I gave this film a 3/5 stars. \n\nNow I give it 4.5/5.",

Still hyperviolent, sometimes plain crazy and set in a somewhat twisted alternate reality it has an actual plot, interesting characters and though over-the-top it's not another Kill Bill.\nThis was before QT tried paying homage to blaxploitation/western/martial arts B-Movies but wrote scripts with genuine stories.\n\nHis style is uncanny though and combined with Tony Scott's directing (I was actually surprised to hear that he has directed this but his experience with action films and his talent for pacing adds considerably to Tarantino's writing) True Romance is an entertaining piece of film.\n\nIt also got a nice ensemble cast with Christopher Walken as delightful to watch as always, a great Gary Oldman in a regrettably small role and young Brad Pitt as a stoner - all led by Christian Slater and Patricia Arquette, both at the height of their short-lived careers as genuine lead material.\n\nCan't say it has become one of my favourite films and although I can understand what people like in Tarantino's work, I doubt that I'll ever truly love one of his films - True Romance is yet another example affirming this thought.\nHowever, great blend of art house and popcorn cinema.",

            "content": "True Romance sounds exactly like my kind of film from literally every angle because it benefited from the direction of Tony Scott and an early Quentin Tarantino screenplay he had deemed to be his finest.\n\n\nTrue Romance has all the zany feeling of a true Quentin Tarantino atmosphere because it combines a legendary soundtrack with the dramatic elements on screen which leave the audiences perplexed about how to feel. It keeps things from ever falling into a single genre category such as refusing the drama from falling into melodramatic territory. And the atmosphere is constantly changing as is the story.\nThe story in True Romance is completely unpredictable. There is no way to tell what is going to happen next, and since it is a Quentin Tarantino-penned film that is the best way to take it. Thanks to Tony Scott's most tense direction in which he creates an atmosphere which is both intense and comedically energetic while still being constantly energetic and entertaining. The film is kind of like if Natural Born Killers omitted most of its kills and was then made right instead of being a sh*tty drug trip and a terrible sitcom, and it goes into a lot of territory which touches upon themes similar to Bonnie and Clyde as well. True Romance is like a modern version of the story where the crime isn't so much about robbery as it is about drug dealing, and the way that the film romanticizes so many themes in a gleefully gritty and gory fashion just goes to show what true romance is. It stays true to its title, and while at certain points I had a feeling that the quantity of themes jam packed into the film had a little bit of overkill, it never felt like too much to take in and it made for thoroughly entertaining cinema which showed off some of the greatest talents that both Quentin Tarantino and Tony Scott have as filmmakers.\nTrue Romance is incredibly well written and benefits from \tQuentin Tarantino's skill for pitching incredibly intelligent dialogue which comes from the actors' mouths so naturally that you wouldn't be able to suspect that it had to be written in the first place. The screenwriting skills that would later win Quentin Tarantino two Academy Awards give savvy fuel for True Romance to run on, and it takes that and runs far thanks to Tony Scott's direction. Tony Scott capitalizes on the passionate and sadistic energy of the story in True Romance which renders it a very well paced romantic crime comedy which is shot very well on some awesome locations and is packed with a theme of true grit, and frankly the role director Tony Scott plays has the exact same skill that only Quentin Tarantino himself could give to the film, so some of Tony Scott's finest directional skill rides True Romance and keeps it intact through all of its theme exploration.\nFrankly, Tony Scott has proven twice to be the best film director to be working with Quentin Tarantino when he made True Romance and later when they worked together on Crimson Tide, and he manages to turn True Romance into an enjoyable and energetic thrill ride which boasts a lot of entertainment and an exceptional cast.\nChristian Slater's lead performance in True Romance is definitely one of his career best. His lead performance in True Romance is the fine line between over the top and excessive in his most intense moments, and at other times it is just naturally charismatic. Christian Slater's lead performance in True Romance makes him perfect for the part because his swift and sharp line delivery is fuelled by his tight edged tenacity, and it gives him an edge to his performance that is really needed to keep the sadistic fun of True Romance alive. Christian Slater is a dead on great cast member in True Romance.\nPatricia Arquette makes a fine lead as well because she has a lot of passionate drama in her line delivery which she delivers without problem, and she has a smile which simply lights up the screen in True Romance. Her chemistry with Christian Slater is also excellent, so the two of them make a really good team in True Romance. Patricia Arquette is in one of her much younger role in True Romance, and her charisma is just terrific.\nChristopher Walken's small time on screen allows him to bring out some of his darkest elements as an actor which completely nails the dramatic aspects of the film. He brings a certain level of sophistication to his role as the Sicilian Vincenzo Coccotti which is sharp and tense, and his scene with Dennis Hopper is excellent because of the powerful chemistry they share.\nDennis Hopper proves time and time again to be a great actor, and in True Romance he delivers a monologue about Sicilians which Quentin Tarantino said to be potentially the greatest thing he had ever written, and it is full of ripe intensity and strength which he as carried for many years as an actor and proves once again as a cast member in True Romance.\nGary Oldman's performance is one of the most oddball of his career. He is unrecognisable in his role of because he looks like a realistic and humane version of the character portrayed by John Travolta in the worst film of his career, Battlefield Earth. But doing something John Travolta could never do, Gary Oldman makes his character nuts and goes overboard without going ridiculous. Within his brief screentime, Gary Oldman establishes that he is flawlessly able to step into the role of an absolute sociopath\nBrad Pitt's young performance shows off some of the charisma which would later get him nominated for several Academy Awards by showing off just what he can do in a small and laid back roll, and the performances of Chris Penn, Samuel L. Jackson, James Gandolfini and Val Kilmer added a nice touch to the film.\n\nSo True Romance may be a little much for some viewers, but benefiting from Quentin Tarantino's excellent screenplay and some of Tony Scott's most powerful direction it proves to be sharp and rich entertainment which is intense and funny at the same time.",

And not every movie needs to be like this.  I don't mind the 10 minute scenes of people talking about nothing relating to the plot because at least the writing is good, but it doesn't need to be in every one of your movies.  And that's what is so fresh about this movie, at least as far as what Tarantino has done.  But yea the movie is great, it has great performances pretty much throughout the entire cast, great action, great writing...it is lacking Tarantino's cool choice for a soundtrack, but that's not really a weakness at all.  It also tells a really good love story between these two characters, as fucked up at it is.  It's definitely better than Sid and Nancy because the actress who played Nancy in that movie was fucking terrible, it relied only on Oldman's performance.  This movie is better in that regards.

            "content": "Ultimately, Quentin Tarantino's attempt at a love story, True Romance seems anything but. While initially a story about finding true love, Tarantino flips the entire genre on its head with a very Tarantino-esque take. In its cast and characters, many connections can be drawn to other Tarantino movies of this era. The movie takes you on a journey with people that you wouldn't want to normally associate with: lowlifes and murderers. The main characters in this movie, played by Christian Slater and Patricia Arquette, have a strong connection to the criminal couples in other Tarantino movies, such as Natural Born Killers and Pulp Fiction. The cast is simply amazing and is reminiscent of the star-studded cast of Tarantino's Pulp Fiction. The comedy is dark and violence pervades throughout most of the film. At first glance, one would think of this movie as almost a romantic comedy. Once you delve deeper into the storyline, you discover that it is much more than that. It comes across as a violent thriller with those small elements of a romantic comedy and portrays itself as classic Tarantino. While this movie was not as groundbreaking as Pulp Fiction or Reservoir Dogs, it did combine genres in a very Tarantino style: breaking the mold of the traditional romance movie.",

On his birthday Clarence's employer sets him up with a call girl named Alabama (Patricia Arquette), the two instantly hit it off and fall in love. But when Clarence tries to emancipate Alabama from her psychotic pimp Drexel (Gary Oldman), he accidentally runs out with a suitcase full of cocaine thinking it is Alabama's clothes. Now the two are on the run from some very dangerous criminals and have to figure out what to do with all the drugs they stole. \nCristian Slater and Patricia Arquette have great on-screen chemistry and give solid performances.

Quentin wrote the screenplay and sold it for money to produce Reservoir Dogs, tough to say which was better, but i think they hit the nail on the head when interpreting Quentins vision on screen. Fantastic, an A++ in my book.  Gary Oldman is great as a white pimp drug dealer, and Walken and Hopper have a dialogue scene which can never be forgotten once seen.  Slater and Arquette have a romance which is played so well, you believe its carried on off camera.

If you're suffering with no idea about how to get a girlfriend, see if this kinda boosts your confidence because True Romance is the true romance. The story is about a guy named Clarence who is celebrating his birthday in the cinema he bumps into Alabama and it is love at first sight for them but it turns out that Alabama was set up by her boss Drexi to purposely bump into him. To escape from Drexi, Clarence and Alabama go to California to live with Clarence's friend Mentor and takes away a suitcase thinking it has her clothes in it but instead has five million dollars worth of cocaine. This unfortunately brings a whole group of underworld characters including a mob boss who wants the suitcase back that has his cocaine in it. I gotta tell you, this film has almost everything that a perfect romance story would that even if it's good, it's impossible to give it a good rating because it's been ages for me since I've seen a movie that was waaaaaaaaaaaay to good for me to give the film a 10/10.

            "content": "Guys like Quentin Tarantino and Kevin Smith burst out of the blocks, garnering massive critical acclaim for their originality and fresh approach to both dialogue and film-making in general. The unfortunate reality for both is that as their careers progressed they both fell in love with their own press and reputations, resulting in a loss of perspective and an inability to differentiate between truly entertaining moments; and self indulgent crap.\r\n\r\nThat's why I strongly believe that for both of the above mentioned allowing other directors to take a crack at their scripts. Hopefully the fresh eye might be more likely to excise irrelevant and plain silly material, while keeping the core elements intact.\r\n\r\nI strongly doubt anyone else might've improved on the final versions of Pulp Fiction or Reservoir Dogs, but since then it's fair to say that Tarantino hasn't made anything rivaling either in terms of quality or longevity. (I'm not sure what anyone else would've made of Dogma, Clerks and Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back to be honest!)\r\n\r\nWe'll never know what Tarantino might have done if allowed to proceed with his True Romance script, what I can say is that the guy who ended up with it did an extremely good job. Not quite great mind you, but about as good as I think this was destined to be.\r\n\r\nThe tale of young lovers Clarence and Alabama Worley starts with them finding each other in Detroit, shows how they come into a large cache of drugs when Clarence decides to 'emancipate' his (now ex-)hooker wife from her menacing and dangerous pimp, and follows them as they flee cross country to LA to work out how best to turn the illicit stash into travellin' cash with which to finance their new lives.\r\n\r\nBut True Romance is more than a rote tale of young lurrrve, it is essentially a series of memorable moments placed amid a sea of references to the obscure and unusual, references that Tarantino has since turned into a career obsession. \r\nThe resulting Tony Scott helmed film contains Elvis, Kung Fu movies, wannabe-black white boys, comic books, B-movie references and of course long tracts of intricately crafted dialogue.\r\n\r\nAs we saw in Pulp and Dogs, these speeches delivered from the lips of quality actors in between well directed passages of action often result in simply legendary output. Samuel L Jackson, Christopher Walken, Harvey Kietel and Steve Buscemi have the capacity to elevate. In lesser hands... er lips... not so good, (David Carradine, practically everyone in Death Proof - even Kurt Russell couldn't 'cool up' his banal speeches).\r\n\r\nTrue Romance manages a few classic moments and has introduced some legendary bit characters. In the moments category the stand off between evil mob boss Christopher Walken and humble everyman - and Clarence's Dad - Dennis Hopper is one for the ages.\r\n\r\nGary Oldman squeezes every ounce out of his drug dealing pimp Drexl, and Bronson Pinchot gets many laughs in one of his less cartoony film roles as out of his depth PA to a big time Hollywood producer Elliot Blitzer. (Brad Pitt and Samuel L Jackson have less meaty roles but do what they can to remain in the memory banks.)\r\n\r\nThe only misstep in my view is the inclusion of Val Kilmer as Elvis Presley, who appears only to Clarence as sort of his guiding angel - apparently this is a sign of Clarence's mental state but this is never really explained and comes off as a little too much - even in a film such as this.\r\n\r\nAside from the King, True Romance works because it gets the mix right between violence, laughs and even music. \r\n\r\nChristian Slater and Patricia Arquette are both perfectly capable in the central roles as Clarence and Alabama while the rest of the cast try to steal scenes from them. \r\n\r\nClarence is cocksure and confident, and Alabama is equally arresting and sassy - with Arquette's bouncing jubblies deserving acting credits of their own.\r\n\r\nIt might have turned out better in Tarantino's hands, but I'm more than happy with what the underrated Tony Scott managed to conjure up. Given his track record of turning potential mediocrity into entertaining flicks such as The Last Boy Scout, Deja Vu and last year's Unstoppable I think he deserves as much credit for the end result as Tarantino does for coming up with the script in the first place.\r\n\r\nFinal Rating - 8 / 10. One or two moments from greatness. True Romance is certainly violent, profane and at times plain ridiculous. It is also fun, creative and extremely memorable.\r\n\r\nIf you liked this review (or even if you didn't) check out oneguyrambling.com for over 800 reviews and plenty more good stuff...",

Thanks to a sharp and witty script and entertaining characters True Romance was extremely cool. The best way I can describe this film is to take Patricia Arquette's character's words and sound like a broken record: all I could think of while watching this film was Quentin Tarantino you are so cool; Tony Scott you are so cool; every single actor in this film you are so cool, True Romance you are so cool. I can't believe I had to wait 21 years to get around to watching this considering how big of a Quentin Tarantino fan I am (and I'm also a huge fan of Tony Scott's work in Man on Fire). Tarantino's energetic script and Scott's stylized direction blended perfectly in this near masterpiece. The cast is absolutely brilliant here and there are so many memorable characters and scenes in this film. I think I enjoyed this film more watching it for the first time now than if I would have seen it in 1993 considering there are so many familiar faces that I probably wouldn't have recognized back then. Brad Pitt, Val Kilmer, Dennis Hopper, Gary Oldman, Christopher Walken, Samuel L. Jackson, James Gandolfini, and Chris Penn all have small but memorable roles. Oldman is barely recognizable playing a pimp with dreadlocks and a glass eye, but it is a unique performance. Christian Slater and Patricia Arquette give the performance of their careers here; it's a shame Slater has been in so many terrible films in the past decade because his performance here was promising. Arquette is adorable as Alabama and I can't think of another sweeter performance than hers. There is so much energy and charm in this film that it's hard to resist. Like good wine, True Romance will probably age better over time considering I couldn't believe how much fun I was having watching an early 90's film for the first time. True Romance you are so cool!\n\nClarence Worley (Christian Slater) is a comic book store clerk who also happens to be a martial arts film buff. He plans to spend his birthday as he always does, at the movies, watching a triple feature of Sonny Chiba. What he doesn't expect is that he will find the love of his life there. While he is watching the film, a pretty woman walks into the theater spilling her popcorn all over him. She apologizes and introduces herself as Alabama (Patricia Arquette). The two fall in love with each other after she opens up to him about her true identity. This leads them through a series of dangerous adventures involving pimps (Gary Oldman), the Sicilian mafia (Christopher Walken, James Gandolfini), drug dealers (Samuel L. Jackson), police officials (Chris Penn, Tom Sizemore), and Hollywood producers (Saul Rubinek, Bronson Pinchot). The film is full of energy and thrills as the two lovers face several obstacles along the way. Thankfully, Clarence seems to have a mentor on his side to guide him: an apparition of his idol Elvis Presley (Val Kilmer) who is sort of his conscious.\n\nEven if you aren't a huge fan of Tarantino you could still enjoy True Romance for all the beloved actors in this film that weren't probably big Hollywood names back then. The film moves so quickly and the script is so energetic that It makes for a very entertaining watch. There are so many memorable scenes in this film, like the face off between Gary Oldman and Christian Slater, the group mexican standoff, and the violent hotel scene involving Gandolfini and Arquette, but the real scene stealer would have to be the one in which Dennis Hopper, who plays Clarence's father, is ambushed by Christopher Walken and his gang and they have a not so friendly chat about Sicilians. It was a pure Tarantino moment and there are a lot of these great dialogues that allow for the film to have such a great pace and move along so nicely. The style and characters in this film make it such a unique experience and film lovers will enjoy the Hollywood satire as well. I am so glad I finally got to see this wild and romantic film. This is another reason why Tony Scott will be missed.",

She later comes clean to him that she's really a hooker, hired to keep Clarence company. After they get married, Clarence manages to steal cocaine from her pimp, and devises a plan to sell it in Hollywood. Meanwhile, the owners of the coke are trying to reclaim it.\r\n\r\nA film centering around a romance has to make us care for these characters who are in love, and buy in to their romance. I am pleased to say that this film manages to do all of the above, giving us a brilliantly believable relationship between Clarence, the charming and likable Elvis fan, and Alabama, the sweet and loyal former call-girl.\r\n\r\nGary Oldman was utterly unrecognizable as Drexl, the white drug-dealing pimp who acts like he's black. It didn't register with me that it was Gary Oldman playing Drexl until a few scenes into the film, but he manages to pull off the role with great intimidation, whilst managing to steal the scenes he appears in. Dennis Hopper plays his role remarkably well, and manages to give off a brilliant monologue to Christopher Walken's intimidating character that ranks highly amongst the best of Tarantino's written dialogue.\r\n\r\nQuentin Tarantino may not have been on directing duties for this film, but his script boasts all of the typical stuff you'd expect from a film by Tarantino himself, the well utilized use of music, the script packed with well written dialogue and witty Tarantinoesque lines (feel free to use Tarantinoesque in your every day vocabulary).\r\n\r\nThe film manages to boast a great sense of danger all throughout, as it is unafraid to kill off it's characters no matter how brilliant they are, in quite some shocking deaths. This sense of danger is pretty much pushed to the limit's in the film's bloody final act. The action is brilliant, which goes well with the unrelenting violence.\r\n\r\nI was quite disappointed to see that Christopher Walken only appeared in one scene, whilst Brad Pitt was pretty much wasted in his small role as the lazy stoner roomate. Also, I did find it strange how Clarence goes into killing due to some advice he gets from a hallucination of Elvis, played by Val Kilmer. While this  does seem like a strange way to get Clarence into actually going into killing, it does show that Clarence's love for Elvis runs much deeper than just admiration, to the point where Clarence is mentally imaging The King giving him advice and praise.\r\n\r\nTrue Romance is a very well acted film that gives us one of the best romance's you'll see on screen, great characters, brilliant action and very Tarantinoesque dialogue that slots perfectly in place alongside the other pieces of brilliance Quentin Tarantino is responsible for giving us.",

The story is very much a QT film, with lots of violence, although there are many slower moments that focus on the romance. The director does a good job of making the main characters likable, even though they aren't very good people.

An absolute masterpiece which features knockout performances from an incredible cast featuring, Slater, Pitt, Walken, Hopper, just too name a few. Like in any movie he is featured in, Christopher Walken absolutely owns. Patrica Arquette also delivers an amazing performance, proving that she, at the time, was one of the most talented actresses in the world. The films central subtext is romance, or somewhat a love story about two lost souls coming together. If you look at it from  different angle though, I think Tarantino's main objective in writing this film was to outline all the themes and conventions that he was well known for with his debut of Reservior Dogs. Even though Tarantino didn't direct the movie, you feel like you are watching a Tarantino film because his thumb print is so engraved in this picture. I believe Tony Scott did his amazing screenplay justice and did an amazing job in directing the film, but you can't help believe if it wasn't for the talent of Tarantino writing the script and finishing the screenplay, the film wouldn't of been half as successful as it was. And this attributes to the witty and sharp dialogue Tarantino is noted for. The film has everything for everyone who enjoys exploitation flicks.  Romance, drugs, violence, comedy, wit, intelligence, sharp and humoros dialouge, superb performances, a great cast, blaxplotation, etc. True Romance really is an entertaining rollercoaster ride which engages in twsts and turns and will have the audience begging for more all way through. I reccomend this film highly for anyone who appreciates the sheer art of B grade, low budget cinema.",

The ideas Slater gets to put them in the fast-lane are obviously high risk, and you know things are going to blow up in his face practically from the first scene, but he's tough as nails and so are the filmmakers.  The action sequences are grotesque but they're certain to grab your attention, and the cameo appearances for the sake of monologue (Walken) or comedy (Pitt) are extremely well picked.  The self-reflexive dialogue, which tended to make fun of Hollywood movies, was fun to sit through as well.  It's good to see that Tarantino had this style established for himself so early on, and that it hasn't changed much since.  He's certainly earned his status as an auteur, and Tony Scott was a good director to pair him with.",

The cast is definitely one of the film's strongest points!\n\nThe story, whilst etchy at the start, is exciting and tense, with humour and action going hand in hand! I think Arquette's transformation from call girl to lovestruck and Slater's from timid to tough are too sudden to be believable but, once a firm story is set, the film takes off and never looks back. Some say the film is excessively violent but I don't agree. The violent scenes are some of the best in the film and make for exciting viewing throughout.\n\nI really recommend this film to anyone who wants an original, intense and funny action picture with plenty of twists.

The romance at its center seems overblown - probably, intentionally - and the action sequences are for the most part graphically violent. I did not find myself wholeheartedly loving the movie although its core plot elements are reminiscent of a Quentin Tarantino movie, one of the few living filmmakers who can craft a truly entertaining movie. Tarantino wrote the screenplay for the movie (his second big screen effort after his great debut \"Reservoir Dogs\" a year earlier) but it is directed by Tony Scott. Thankfully, the movie does not feature the director's now-signature nauseating editing and directorial style but it is hard not to believe that the movie could have been taken to a whole other level if Tarantino had directed it. (Scott changed the darker ending Tarantino had written, which would have been far more effective, but probably Scott's ending more suits the movie's fantasy theme). \r\nThe movie opens in Detroit and centers on Clarence (Christian Slater), a comic book store clerk and (kung-fu) film buff who while watching a triple feature for his birthday at a cinema gets hit on by beautiful blonde Alabama (Patricia Arquette). After the two spend a great night and make love, Alabama reveals that she is a call girl whom his boss hired as a birthday present. It is a case of extreme love of a first sight and the two marry the next day. \r\nAn impediment to their happy life is Alabama's quirky pimp Drexl Spivey (Gary Oldman in a wicked role) who Clarence visits and kills, and grabs a bag that he assumes belongs to Alabama but only to find it filled with cocaine. And from then on the two go on the run when they learn that the murder is labeled as a drug-related killing and a mob is after them. They head to LA to try and sell the drugs and start a life. \r\nA big part of the potential success of this movie has to do with the strength of the leads and their love story. I did not find myself rooting for them as much as one should and Slater and Arquette are just OK. Part of the problem is that they are overshadowed by a far stronger, A-list supporting cast (all in very brief roles) that alone makes this movie worth seeing. There's Oldman, Dennis Hopper in a heartfelt role as Clarence's security guard ex-police officer father, Christopher Walken as ruthless gangster Vincenzo Coccotti who is on the search for who stole the money (the scene between him and Hopper is one of the movie's best and most memorable), and Brad Pitt in a scene stealing role as Rapaport's stoner roommate.  Others include Michael Rapaport as an aspiring actor friend of Clarence's, Saul Rubinek as a film producer, James Gandolfini as one of Coccotti's henchmen who shares a violent encounter with Alabama, and Tom Sizemore and Chris Penn as two LA cops. Val Kilmer delivers the voice of the apparition of Clarence's idol - none other than Elvis Presley - who guides all his actions and is sort of his conscience.",

Taking it upon himself to pay Drexl a visit Clarence then finds himself high-tailing it with Alabama and a suitcase full of cocaine which invites the attention of gangsters, cops and Hollywood producers.   \n If you can imagine this film being shot in the same split-time frame structure that \"Pulp Fiction\" had, then this would give you an idea of how Tarantino intended this to look. His original screenplay was certainly layered in this way, with the characters appearing then reappearing at different times throughout the film. Sadly, we'll never get to see this, but it doesn't matter very much, as this is still an excellent ultraviolent foray into Tarantino's criminal underworld. What really makes this standout is his astute ear for dialogue, played out by an impressive ensemble of wonderful actors. There are so many excellent scenes (and performances) it's hard to pick a favourite. Crime boss Don Vincenzo (Christopher Walken) and Clarence's dad Clifford (Dennis Hopper) having a tete-a-tete over the historical inter-racial relationship between the Moors and Sicilians and Clarence's confrontation with wild-eyed, white rastafarian pimp Drexl being just a couple of numerous quality ones. Added to which, there's a brief but brilliant turn from Brad Pitt as a stoner flatmate, who uses all the toilet paper and has a liking for beer and cleaning products and James Gandolfini as a cold, sadistic hitman. Like I said, there's too many to mention. Influenced by previous 'lovers on the lam' films such as, \"Bonnie & Clyde\" and \"Badlands\" but most notably like \"Wild at Heart\" with it's numerous violent confrontations and it's array of colourful characters. Holding it's own against any one of them. I'm not director Tony Scott's biggest admirer but his hyperkinetic style actually suits the pace and explosive nature of this story and it's characters and he actually compliments Tarantino's writing.\n Stylish, gripping, violent, profane and endlessly quotable. What more do you expect when sitting down to a Tarantino flick? He may not have directed it but it still stands as one of his finest.",

            "content": "Although True Romance was directed by Tony Scott, make no mistake. Through and through, True Romance is the handiwork of Quentin Tarantino. The script he sold that funded Reservoir Dogs, True Romance is the reason that Tarantino has had the amazing career of the last 15-odd years. Without True Romance, his first script for a major studio film, Pulp Fiction would likely have not been made. And what a breakthrough. Combining elements of Tarantino's usual crime fare with a spoof of romance, True Romance is one of the best movies in his canon of work. Scott's direction is sharp, though, and despite his more linear approach to the story, as well as his far happier ending (that actually suits his version better), he contributes a worthy amount to the film's raw energy. Christian Slater and Patricia Arquette are perfect for their respective roles, as both are experienced enough to have real acting chops while not being recognizable enough to scoff at the whirlwind romance. The film's true strength, however, lies in its stellar supporting cast. From Dennis Hopper as the father, to Gary Oldman as the pimp, to Christopher Walken as a mob boss with a young Brad Pitt as a stoner, all the way to Val Kilmer's silhouette and voice as Elvis and even an early appearance of Samuel L. Jackson and James Gandolfini, True Romance's cast is one for the ages. Oddly, despite not being directed by Tarantino, it contains quite a few actors from his later movies, such as Pitt (Inglourious Basterds), Walken (Pulp Fiction), Jackson (Pulp Fiction), and even Chris Penn (Reservoir Dogs). Among Tarantino's film, I would rank True Romance fourth, after Pulp Fiction, Inglourious Basterds, and Reservoir Dogs, just being a hair above Kill Bill (both parts).",

I felt extremely pissed off when I found out about the Christopher Walken/Dennis Hopper Scene and how short it actually is.\n    I don't know if anyone else feels like this but just wanted to ask ummm what casting director  thought Michael Rapaport was any kind of a decent actor?

All in all this could have been so much better but don't believe the hype that its this amazing perfect classic movie from the 90s.

            "content": "True Romance is a romantic crime saga penned by Quentin Tarantino and directed by Tony Scott. The story by Tarantino tells the story of Clarence who marries a lovable call-girl named Alabama. Soon after they profess their love for eachother, they get married. As her husband, Clarence feels that it's his duty to kill her pimp and erase that part of her life. Clarence ends up stealing a suitcase of cocaine from her pimp Drexl, and they get caught up in a bizzare sequence of events after the owners hastily try to reclaim it. This film boasts a memorable cast, including Christian Slater, Patricia Arquette, Dennis Hopper, Val Kilmer, Gary Oldman, Brad Pitt, Christopher Walken, Samuel L. Jackson, James Gandolfini, Michael Rappaport, Chris Penn, and Tom Sizemore.\r\n\r\nThis film is a masterfully written, directed pulpy 90s action flick. It's truly an ultimate guys movie. The dialogue in this film is beautiful, lurid poetry, thanks to Tarantino's witty script. The atmosphere of the film is pure Gen X romantic fantasy, due to Tony Scott's violent and vicious direction. This isn't your average romance film, and i'm sure many people refuse to call it a \"romantic\" film. It is though, this film is purely a romance. Slater and Arquette generate dynamic chemistry and the two of them together became a very likeable pair. They are a more lovable and innocent Bonnie & Clyde. \r\n\r\nChristian Slater is incredible as Clarence, an innocent Elvis loving, Sonny Chiba adoring, comic book nerd. Patricia Arquette's cute and sexy performance is a perfect companion to his child-like innocence. As I said before, the two of them produce fireworks together. They aren't the only two producing fireworks thought, their are a handful of memorable sequences in this film. A truly dark and twistedly hilarious interrogation sequence between Dennis Hopper and Christopher Walken stands out, and a very funny, almost deliriously over-the-top stand off at the very end of the film. This film is pure movie making magic. \r\n\r\nGary Oldman delivers a memorable performance as a white pimp who truly believes that he's black. \"You must have thought it was white boy day...\" Oh, god... Oldman is perfect in this, such a funny and cutting performance. Brad Pitt is particulary funny as a dazed stoner named Floyd, one of the smaller roles in the film but he is so damn good that it's one of the most memorable characters in the film. I could go on all day, this film is full of terrific supporting performances. Oh, also, it's a pleasure to see a pre Tony Soprano James Gandolfini. The guy can flat out act, and scare you. He's so convincing as a soul-less murdering thug.\r\n\r\nThis film has serious guts. SPOILER ALERT, almost every character in this film gets blown to bits. This is pure Taratino... this is pure Tony Scott. It's full of cheeky monologues and delirious, over-the-top gun-fights. This is a masterpiece for what it is. \r\n\r\nTrue Romance is an absolutely bizzare, lurid, brilliant romantic crime saga. One of the best films of the 90s and one of my favorite films.",

And if he had directed it, it could have been one of the greatest films of all time. Sadly, the direction is just boring. It's lacking style and finesse, which Tarantino surely would have provided. It's not a perfect movie, but for some reason I can't resist not giving this film a 100. It just has great writing, ginormous characters, one of the best ensemble casts ever and quite possibly the coolest shootout of all time. It's just gosh darn good filmmaking. Oh, and Gary Oldman was ridiculously awesome.",

The monologues are\r\ncaptivating, the violence is bombarding, and the story itself is\r\nsurprisingly charming. Christian Slater and Patricia Arquette deliver a\r\ndynamic lead portraying a lovestruck fantasy for any couple wishing to\r\nkeep their relationship on the outer realm of exciting, to say the\r\nleast.\r\n\r\nThe supporting cast is superb, consisting of many big names and faces\r\nthat have rocked the silver screen for decades.

From\r\nmobsters and police, hookers and tough guys, movie producers and\r\ngangsters, stoners and pimps, even the humble voice of a musical\r\nlegend, this eclectic mix of characters unravel the 1990's and opens\r\nthe door to a wide array of critics leaving only one opinion that is\r\ntruly relevant, yours.\r\n\r\n-Eric Douglas Statzer",

NO WAY.\r\nStraight from the opening scene you feel the Tarantino vibe straight off with the \"three kung-fu movies\" pick up line, and the music that you think it doesn't go with the film but then you realise it does, and from then on it's just endless great performances, brilliant scenes (even if some are hard to watch) and one hell of shoot-out scene. It is pretty difficult to not like this film...\r\n\r\nClarence is a comic book worker who loves Elvis and wants to be a 'bad motherfucker' just like people in the movies. Alabama is Clarenece's call girl (kind of whore) who turns out to love him and gets married to him the next day. But when Clarence goes to sort out Alabama's pimp (Gary Oldman), who looks almost exactly like Jonathan Davis from Korn, he is struck with two murders and half a million dollars worth of cocaine everything goes tits up for the newly married couple and the result is bloody and brilliant.\r\n\r\nThe amount of fantastic cameo's of this ensemble cast is just unreal ranging from Walken's crazy gangster to Pitt's dopey stoner it's just great performance after great performance. But out of all the cameo's no one can top Gary Oldman's white boy pimp with a crazy scar, the scene with him had Tarantino's smell all over it and it was by far the funniest scene in the film to. \r\nBut of course this film can't just rely on great cameo's...\r\nEnter the sexiest killing couple since Badlands, Slater and Arquette. These two young lovers are smart, strong and loyal and they definitely give one of the best performances of their careers and made a lot of teens in 1993 think what they could do with their lives...\r\n\r\nBut what really punched me in the face about this film was the two blood-rideen scenes, which were so well done and cringey that I thought there was no hope for the characters, it was too gripping in a way but so brilliant (Tarantino certainly helped out with the beating scene).\r\n\r\nBrilliant, just brilliant really, excellent performances and scenes. As I said before it's pretty hard to not like this film.\r\nRECOMMENDED\r\n5/5",

And the total domination ending was kinda dumb too. \n\nI would've thought that Patricia Arquette's character would've covered up a bit more after being freed from her previous job as an escort but she really didn't seem to be covering up at all (that's just a small matter though). \n\nI thought Christian Slater did a tremendous job in this movie though. There was too little of Samuel L. Jackson and Brad Pitt. But Christopher Walken stole the show for me; I love him in every movie he's in.\n\nOverall, it was a promising film that ended up in between dumb and okay for me.",

            "content": "True Romance, a film written by one of the best writers in film today; Quentin Tarantino and directed by Tony Scott. The film sees a a loner called Clarence (Christian Slater) who picks up a good looking girl while going to the movies. The girl called Alabama (Patricia Arquette) is in fact a call girl hired by Slater's boss as a birthday present. But the pair actually do fall in love with one another. However when Clarence discovers the violent nature of Alabama's former pimp Drexl, he goes round to kill the pimp in an attempt to free Alabama from her past life. But not everything goes to plan and ends up throwing the pair in a world of shit. As usual the dialogue in the film is top notch from Tarantino, but the directing style of Tony Scott moves the story on a bit too quickly; making it seem quite predictable. But True Romance still holds up as a good film with actors such as Val Kilmer, Gary Oldman, Christopher Walken, Dennis Hopper, and Brad Pitt all adding to the film. There is a brilliant scene with Christopher Walken and Dennis Hopper in a trailer, where Hopper's character tells Walken that all Sicilian men are of Black descent, which is one of the funniest scenes in a film. Overall the film is a good modernized Romeo & Juliet story but with a happy ending.",

            "content": "True Romance may have been directed by Tony Scott and told in a somewhat linear fashion, but it still has Tarentino writtien all over it, and like most of his movies, its good, damn good.  Tarentino only wrote the screenplay for this one and sold it to make enough money to fund his debut film Reservoir Dogs which came out a year earlier.  The dialogue is the same as everything else he's written, perfect.  It's funny and sounds real.  I've always liked Tarentino's scripts the best because they remind me of how me and my freunds talk.  We never talk about what we're doing just discuss random stuff.  Tarentino is the only writer who understands this.  It tells the story of Clarence who meets and falls in love with a girl named Alabama who just happens to be a call girl for an abusing pimp.  He goes, kills the pimp & takes what he believes are Alabama's belongings.  It turns out to be just a suitcase full of half a million dollars worth of cocaine.  The rest of the movie is spent with Clarence trying to sell it and the gangsters who owned it chasing him.  The directing by Tony Scott is good, but not as good as if Tarentino himself had directed it.  It's typical for a crime-action movie and suits it well enough.  The music is kind of weird, sometimes it fits, sometimes it doesn't, not much else to say about it.  The highlight is not in the actors, but the characters they play.  They're all original yet familiar.  Clarence played by Christian Slater, which is probably his best performance, is just you're average guy.  He works at a comic book store, goes to movies in his spare time for fun, and doesn't really know what he's doing.  Alabama, played by Patricia Arquette, is just a sad girl who you never really can understand whats up with her.  She's a mystery and that's what is so entriguing about her.  The rest of the characters are fantastic, Christopher Walken as a gangster, James Gandolfini as his hitman, Dennis Hopper as Clarences dad (who gives the best diss in movie history, calling Walken a 'eggplant' to which Walken replies \"You're a cantelope\", Brad Pitt as a hilarious stoner who never leaves the couch, Michael Rapaport as a wannabe actor, and a drug crazed movie producer clearly influenced by Oliver Stone.  True Romance certainly isn't the best thing to ever come out of Quentin Tarentino's mind, but it's still worth checking out.",

This is one of Tarantinos best screenplays and I think this could have been even better if Tony Scott had decided to go with the intial script that Tarantino had written instead of changing it for a more hollywood happy ending. The Alternative ending which is in the Tarantino version has Clarence die in the Shoot-Out and ends with Alabama leaving with the money alone, She then has a short monologue before we see the credits roll. This film is also shown in Non-Linear format, Same format in which we have seen Quentin use in his pictures on more than one occasion in the past : Pulp Fiction and Reservoir Dogs. This version is avaliable off torrent sites it is titled \"The Tarantino Cut\", I believe it is fan made but it is excellant, Recommended any a fan of True Romance. Overall I think True Romance is often overlooked and one of the most underated films of the 90's.",

It features a heck of a cast, including Christian Slater, Patricia Arquette, Dennis Hopper, Gary Oldman, Brad Pit, Christopher Walken, Val Kilmer, Michael Rapaport, Chris Penn, Tom Sizemore, Samuel L.

Some of these actors have pretty small roles, but everyone contributes so fine, that as a whole, this cast is perfect, and maybe is one of the greatest of all times.

I can't see myself wanting more from this film, aside from a few more scenes like we saw in the first 30 minutes, focussing on the romance of the two leads. Those scenes were so well-handled that I felt the need to see so much more of that, but I understand that we eventually had to go on to bigger and better things.

In fact they are so believable that director Tony Scott remade the ending and let Worley live much to Tarantino's behest.\r\n\r\nIncredible all star cast and this movie begins the Tarantino formula of crazy dialogue, waky twists and turns, and overblown gunplay.\r\n\r\nArquette is one of the most sexiest ever babes to play a \"on the lam-devil may care\" type protagonist. I'd say followed in 2nd place by the similar storyline Dern in Wild at heart.\r\n\r\nThe classic scene by Hopper in the trailor with Walken is legendary.\r\nA fun filled ride with no brakes.\r\n\r\nBrilliant.",

I really doubt that \"True Romance\" would have been the way it is if the director were Quentin Tarantino.\r\n\r\nOne of the best elements of this film is its actors. You can almoust say it is a dream cast. You'll find many likable who are strong enough to play leading roles. The cast is so big and excellent that often you will find yourself disapointed because of the screentime from one or the other actor. The example would be a famous Sicilian scene, where we see Hoper's and Walken's characters for the last time.\r\n\r\nAlthough the scrip is extraordinary, but story somehow doesn't seems right. It isn't bad but it more seems like dream of blonde girl. \r\n\r\nAs I said for me the story was a bit unrealistic, but all other elements including and script is cinema at it's best.",

They decide to move out LA where the drug scene is huge, sell it off, and move down to Cancun. Simple, right? Wrong, you've got the supplier of the coke, a mob boss, the cops, and many others after the two love birds over this coke. There's a certain mystosism about this movie, with the Elvis mentor, played by Val Kilmer, who comes off as the dirty conscience that Clarence seems to listen to and the heavy bond of love between Clarence & Alabama, this movie just seems to hit all the right notes of what it is...a love story...with violence. And only Tarantino could write it. With Tony Scott's sick direction at the helm, you've got a fast paced film that knows the speed for the viewer. Plus, you just gotta love Brad Pitt as the stoner Floyd, many don't know this, but his character was the inspiration for \"Pineapple Express\". Great movie, one of my true favorite films,",

The leads look great, they act even better (along with the rock-solid ensemble cast) and the romance and action comes fast and furious (not to mention quite bloody).  The pace of the film moves like nobody's business.  You will gawk at how many famous actors are in this film: Christian Slater, Patricia Arquette, Dennis Hopper, Val Kilmer, Gary Oldman, Tom Sizemore, Chris Penn (R.I.P.), Brad Pitt, Christopher Walken, Michael Rapaport, and Samuel L. Jackson!  Yes, this is a cast that is electric as a power plant.  \r\n\r\nSpeaking of electricity, sparks fly when a man and a woman meet at a Detroit bar, Clarence and Alabama.  They go to a kung-fu movie marathon (and as a trademark of movie buff Tarantino, talk about movies and Elvis for most of the film), and find true romance in their time together.  Alabama was a callgirl (for four days) until she met Clarence.  Clarence works at a comic book store (kind of like Tarantino's video clerk gig before he hit it big!), and feels that Alabama is the one.  So they get married, but not before Clarence takes out Alabama's former pimp.  With a suitcase of supposedly \"money\" in his hand, Clarence takes Alabama to L.A. to start a new life together.  That is, unless the mob who owns the \"money\" and the cops have something to say about it.  \r\n\r\nNow that you got the gist of TRUE ROMANCE, let me say that this is a film inspired by the pop culture of movies and how people percieve real life in correspondence to movies.  It's easy to be aware that you're watching a movie, but when a movie itself is aware that it's playing with the reality of the main characters' situation is something else.  \r\n\r\nClarence and Alabama hold a similar relationship to Quentin Tarantino's other story's anti-heroes, NATURAL BORN KILLERS.  That couple were murderous psychopaths who found thrill in killing, while Clarence and Alabama are lovebirds who heaped themselves in a worldwind of trouble through theft from the mob.  \r\n\r\nTony Scott surely stylizes the story with fast editing and brutal, intense violence, yet he films Quentin Tarantino's story with an honest sensibility that lets you have fun with the main characters and their obsession with blending their obsession to movies with real life.  \r\n\r\nTRUE ROMANCE is a seminal 90's film, and a hip and hot action romance.  You will feel electrified by the performances and the furious and bloody action that goes down in TRUE ROMANCE.  If there's one moral to be learned from TRUE ROMANCE, that would be to never screw with the Mob!  Be ready for more Critiques and Opinions on Every Movie I Can Get My Hands On!",

Maybe that's why he couldn't direct it, but it is a brilliant film, with an amazing cast and made a great director. It has movie buff Clarence Worley (Christian Slater) meeting call girl Alabama Whitman (Patricia Arquette), who was hired by Clarence's boss as a birthday present. Alabama falls in love with Clarence, and they marry. Clarence tells Alabama's pimp Drexl Spivey (Gary Oldman) that he's married, and wants to cut ties. It ends in murder, and Clarence ends up with a suitcase full of pure uncut cocaine, who they decide to give it to Clarence's actor friend Dick Ritchie (Michael Rapaport) living in Hollywood, he has contacts, such as actor Elliot (Bronson Pinchot) who knows movie producer Lee Donowitz (Saul Rubinek) who will have it, but unknown to Clarence and Alabama, gangster Vincenzo Coccotti (Christopher Walken) is hot on their tail, looking for the cocaine. This is a smart, savvy film with great dialogue and some brilliant performances, also including Val Kilmer as Clarence's mentor Elvis Presley, Brad Pitt as junkie Floyd and Dennis Hopper as Clarence's Dad Clifford, who gives a brilliant speech in the film. Filled with Scott's usual flair for amazing glossy visuals and fast editing. This is a clever, funny and surprising film that never gets boring.",

The cast was terrific, and the dialogue was typical Tarantino awesome.  And like I said before, Tony Scott is okay, but he's no Ridley Scott.  I didn't like this particular story as much as Tarantino's other creations, however.  It was a bit simple, and the climax where absolutely everyone gets shot seems like a bit of a cop out.  And while the film has one of the best ensemble casts I have seen, most of the parts are criminally short.  Oldman, Hopper, Pitt, and Walken are only in one or two scenes tops, and have only a handful of lines.  Sure, it's nice to see minor parts in such good hands, but more would have been appreciated.

Many of what would become his trademark elements are here: over-the-top violence, a huge cast, lots of idiosyncratic dialogue, drugs, references to kung-fu movies, and an overall celebration of American kitsch. There are even a number of actors he would hire again: Christopher Walken, Brad Pitt, and Samuel L. Jackson are all here. This is a little bit different from his other movies, though, in that it centers on an actually halfway sincere love story. Christian Slater (who's ok here as a Tarantino-esque geek) and Patricia Arquette (who's actually pretty excellent as a hooker with a heart of gold) are a couple on the run from the mob and the police with a suitcase full of cocaine. Of course lots of complications and violence ensue. Dennis Hopper has a decent small role as Slater's father, and Gary Oldman is surprisingly convincing as an unbelievably hideous and vile pimp who seems to think he is a Jamacian. James Gandolfini shows up as a mobster long before he got to play Tony Soprano. Val Kilmer is in a couple of scenes as Elvis, though we never really get to see him clearly. Brad Pitt's part is tiny but amusing as a permanently stoned slacker. Michael Rapaport is funny as a terrible actor. The director Tony Scott, although he has a tendency to turn his movies into over-edited, ADD messes, is thankfully restrained enough here that you can actually tell what is going on. There's a strange calypso music score by Hans Zimmer (why calypso? I have no idea). My biggest complaint is with the movie's climax, which seems to inexplicably skip half the necessary scene. If you like Tarantino's other movies, especially Reservoir Dogs, you'll like this one as well, though it's not quite as good as the rest.",

            "content": "A couple weekends ago, a very fine actor named Dennis Hopper passed away. Like many film buffs, I've always had a soft spot in my heart for the Hollywood renegade. Regrettably, I have never seen the film that several cite as his masterpiece, 'Easy Rider,' the druggie road movie from the '60s, also directed by Hopper. This may be why I prefer Hopper's work from 1986 on, when his best acting for the screen arrived. The man who famously played the eccentric acolyte in \u00e2\u0080\u0098Apocalypse Now\u00e2\u0080\u0099 toned it down just a hair (after sobering up his personal life), but whether he was delightfully hamming it up as the villain in \u00e2\u0080\u0098Speed\u00e2\u0080\u0099 or making a quiet cameo in \u00e2\u0080\u0098EdTV,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 those wild eyes, that hippie dialect\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 that character he made himself to be, all of it was always present.\n\nThe day of his death, I looked through an online photo gallery showcasing Hopper's most notable contributions to film and was once again reminded of the phenomenal scene he shares with Christopher Walken in 'True Romance.' As a whole, the scene is damn near perfect film-making, mostly because the acting portion of it IS perfect. It easily makes my top three thespian moments of 1990s cinema.\n\nIf only the rest of the film could compare. \n\nDon't get me wrong - I own the \"2-disc Special Edition Unrated Director's Cut\" because it's a pretty fun flick - there's just no denying the layer of lunacy the entire movie rests on. I think the screenwriter, none other than Quentin Tarantino, realized its zaniness either while or after writing it, so he sold the script to allow Tony Scott ('Top Gun,' 'The Taking of Pelham 1 2 3') to direct instead of himself, tinkering with the image he was building. Screenplay's faults aside, all Tarantino fans can rest easy knowing that the dialogue is still unmistakeably Tarantino's, waxing poetic of pop culture references ranging from martial arts star Sonny Chiba to Elvis Presley (and that's just before the opening credits). There's even an unnecessary Samuel L. Jackson cameo.\n\nChristian Slater and Patricia Arquette lead this 'Bonnie and Clyde'-meets-'Scarface' all-star extravaganza as the lovebirds Clarence, the usually mellow comics store manager madly in love with \"the King,\" and Alabama, a rookie prostitute who believes in monogamy in the case of love. They do a fairly decent job keeping this cavalcade together, but the characters' PDA, despite the unexpectedly nice chemistry between the actors, gets irksome a time or two. They're definitely not the worst performances of the picture; I'll give those dishonors to Tom Sizemore, more manic than Robin Williams as an L.A.P.D. detective, and Saul Rubinek, WAY overacting as a coke-snorting Hollywood producer. \n\nPoor Val Kilmer does what he can as Elvis/Clarence's inner dialogue (and I like the choice not to show his face), but one more scene in the middle would've been courteous to the character's player and to the story. Every other performance is terrific. Having already mentioned Hopper and Walken, there's also Brad Pitt, on perfect low-key pitch as beach-garbage stoner (and accidental snitch) Floyd. One step below these three, the next batch consists of Gary Oldman as a deadly pimp convinced he's black, pre-\"Sopranos\" James Gandolfini as a creepy, murderous mob goon, Bronson Pinchot (yup, Balki from ABC's sitcom \"Perfect Strangers\") as an unfortunate, sniveling piss-ant stool pigeon, and (to my great surprise) Michael Rappaport as Clarence's innocent simpleton friend aspiring to be a paid actor. Also nice to see Chris Penn and Paul Ben-Victor in there too.\n\nMy friend Josh Glasgow beat me to the punch in circling the music as the number one problem. The xylophone score by Hans Zimmer (titled \"You're So Cool\" after Alabama's love letter via bev-nap to Clarence) is one of the composer's best and most recognizable, but other than during the epilogue, it has absolutely no place in this film (My theory: He was hoping to pull off magic similar to the zither score of 'The Third Man'). The soundtrack selections are even worse. Loud techno makes Clarence's confrontation with Alabama's employer unbearable, and the cliche choice to underscore the Hopper-Walken interrogation with L\u00c3\u00a9o Delibes' \"The Flower Duet\" is my only complaint with the best scene of the film. The rest of the soundtrack mainly consists of oldies too successful in their respective times to be deemed \"Tarantinoesque,\" clearly the failed goal.\n\nAs I bring this review to a close, I feel like I've unfairly torn 'True Romance' a new one. If you leave behind your common sense and just allow the film to be what Tony Scott has chosen it to be, it's a successful amusement park trip complete with cotton candy... if you can stomach the abundance of violence. Even if you can't, the final feathery shootout will probably still make you roll your eyes, shake your head, and snicker. Glad 'True Romance' was made, but even happier Tarantino passed on directing. Wise choice on his half.",

Christopher Walken dominates the atmosphere for the first 5 or 6 minutes, until Hopper accepts (or refuses it depending on how you look at it) his situation and completely takes over the wheel from there. The film's two lead characters differ greatly from your typical Tarantino unsympathetic protagonists. They seem to have at least a little bit of a moral drive. They sell cocaine to get some money, but they never use it. Clarence kills a pimp for the greater good, but has his own doubts about doing it. Alabama kills a gangster in self-defense, after refusing to give up her husband. And (spoilers) then they have a kid and spend the rest of their lives spending. Its cast is greatly directed by Tony Scott, and largely makes this movie what it is.",

They have a one night stand and they become very much in love with one another and get married the next day. He soon finds out that she is a hooker and decides he wants to pay a little visit to her pimp, beautifully portrayed by Gary Oldman. Well Drexler, thats the pimps name, does not take kindly to Clarence telling him that Alabama is no longer his possesion and a violent fight breaks out.\r\nNow I wont tell you what happens but Clarence leaves grabbing what he thinks is Alabamas things, but turns out to be a suitcase full of cocaine. \r\nSo he and his new bride decide to head to California and try to sell the cocaine and now he has the mob, the police and movie producers wanting what he has.\r\nThe action sequences are thrilling, especially the last 30 minutes. The directing is great and the script, written by Quentin Tarantino  (his first), is pure gold when it comes to the dialogue. The most perfect example of that would be the scene where Christopher Walken and Dennis Hopper have a sit down and chat, excellent scene.\r\nGreat acting all around, a very well put together cast for this particular story. You have Christopher Walken, Christian Slater, Val Kilmer, Brad Pitt (who is just a riot as a stoner), Bronson Pinchot, James Gandolfini (great role), Tom Sizemore (when I see him in this film it makes me sad that he pissed his acting career away on drugs), Samuel L. Jackson,Saul Rubinek, Chris Penn (also makes me sad because he died at a very young age), and Michael Rapaport.\r\nThis is one of Tonys Scotts best films, and not many have heard about it. The only thing I did not like about this picture was Patricia Arquette, I have never liked her and in this film she is a little better but still annoying.\r\nI love this fim, it takes me back to a time where I was having a rough time in my llife and I would watch this movie as a pick me up cause some points of the movie I can relate. We all want to escape the evil in life, but we first have to destroy the obstacles that stand in our way.\r\nHighly recommend this action thrilled, funny film.\r\n4.5 out of 5",

Not that Scott is an incompetent director when working on his own, but it is Tarantino's razor-sharp script that really shines. The ensemble cast is exceptional - Christian Slater and Patricia Arquette as Clarence and Alabama have great on-screen chemistry, and other notable highlights include James Gandolfini's imposing, sadomasochistic mafia henchman Virgil, Gary Oldman's pimp character Drexl, Val Kilmer's \"Kingly\" manifestation of Clarence's conscience, and Brad Pitt also has fun playing a stoner. For the most part, the film's plot keeps you entertained, (and Hans Zimmer's cracking score does keep things moving along nicely) though the overplayed finale disappoints slightly (strangely beautiful ballet of violence though it is). I'm not quite sure what the message behind the film is (if there really is one) - you have to kill a few people, smuggle drugs and escape to Mexico to truly love someone, perhaps? Tarantino had directed the film as he originally intended to do the end result would have been a little more consistent, but even as it is, the film is still a strangely fulfilling romp.",

Are we supposed to like these self-obsessed, homicidal maniacs? The answer to both these questions is a resounding yes, because the wishes being fulfilled here belong to former geeky shop assistant Quentin Tarantino, and he had the talent to flesh out his fantasy with vividly-drawn characters spouting instantly classic dialogue during jaw-dropping set-pieces.\r The I\u2019d **** Elvis speech that introduces comic book clerk Clarence, the rooftop confession and declaration of love by Alabama, the showdown with Drexl, Virgil at the motel and, of course, the Sicilian scene are all hugely appealing to any budding hopeful. What Tarantino couldnt have known when he was scribbling away behind the counter at Video Archives, however, is that they would be equally attractive to established and, in some cases, legendary stars.\r Despite his earlier reservations, Pitt signed on to play a bone idle stoner flatmate; the notoriously picky Gary Oldman sank his post-Dracula teeth into the role of a racially-confused pimp; and Chris Penn, Tom Sizemore and Samuel L. Jackson happily played virtual bit parts. Add never-to-be-bettered work from Christian Slater and Patricia Arquette to the mix, and you already have something special. But the genuinely great moments in True Romance belong to James Gandolfini, Dennis Hopper and Christopher Walken.\r Even with an excellent screenplay and a rogues gallery of protagonists waiting to be brought to life, any film needs the right director, and True Romance boasts an ideal helmer in the unlikely shape of Tony Scott. Who better than the director of Top Gun to bring an arrested adolescents fantasy to life? Scott verges on self-parody in terms of the gloss and pace he brings to proceedings, giving the movie a relentless energy that never allows the audience to stop and consider the absurdity of it all.\r Alabamas execution of Virgil, complete with feral scream and lovingly photographed, blood-soaked breasts, earned the film notoriety and a run-in with the censors, although Scotts approach to the material is best summed up by another, less controversial creative decision. The script has Clarences initial drug-hawking meeting with Elliot take place, unremarkably enough, in a zoo, but the director wanted something with a little more pizzazz, so he set the sequence on a rollercoaster. Tarantino is overstating the case when he compares Scott to undervalued auteurs of the past (Douglas Sirk he aint), but theres no doubt he was perfect to orchestrate this wild ride.\r This is not only an immensely entertaining violent action but genuinely romantic at times.

            "content": "An absolutely wild film directed by Tony Scott and written by Quentin Tarantino, True Romance is a real guy's movie to watch on Valentine's Day or the day before, as it was in my case. Starring an ensemble cast with a tremendous cast ofAn absolutely wild film directed by Tony Scott and written by Quentin Tarantino, True Romance is a real guy's movie to watch on Valentine's Day or the day before, as it was in my case. Starring an ensemble cast with a tremendous cast of characters in small cameo-esque roles throughout that really add thunder to this film. Over-the-top, stupid, and thoroughly Tarantino, True Romance is an odd little love story with an affinity for guns, unexpected drug dealing, and a whole cast of gangsters, cops, and movie producers, all vying for the coke from an unexpected source. With great acting and writing, the film may be a bit predictable and is thoroughly cliched, but is remains terrific entertainment throughout its runtime.The best scene in the film is the infamous \"Sicilian scene\" with Christopher Walken and Dennis Hopper. It is all we see of Walken's mysterious Don Vincenzo, the consigliere for infamous gangster Blue Lou Boyle, who had his coke accidentally stolen by stupid Clarence (Christian Slater). With the coke worth than $500,000, it should be clear that he is unhappy. Going to Clarence's father Clifford (Hopper), Don Vincenzo gives the man a chance to talk. A raw, tough-nosed conversation, it is a brilliantly eloquent, concise, and written sequence by Tarantino. Naturally, Walken nails the role and is a real highlight of the film as a whole. The nervous energy given off by Hopper, but his solid defiance to this brutally violent man before him is equally terrific. This is a scene that gives Tarantino to spin this crime yarn into something of higher literary significance and he does it, with a gorgeously penned scene. Walken and Hopper do the writing justice, plus some.In a typically chameleon-like performance, Gary Oldman also steals the show as pimp Drexl Spivey. Confronted by Clarence to free Alabama (Patricia Arquette) from his grasp and also the man with the coke from Blue Lou Boyle, Oldman's Drexl is a black man wannabe with a scarred face, one eye, and long brown dreadlocks. This man really is a chameleon. Psychotic, unhinged, and an undeniably wild pimp, Oldman's character may be my favorite from the film, even though Walken's terrific Sicilian gangster gets the best scene in the entire film.Naturally, James Gandolfini is also tremendous in this film as Don Vincenzo's trigger man Virgil. Roughing up Alabama to find out where the coke is, Virgil takes a liking to her and let's her take one shot before he finishes her off. Menacing, tough, and yet warm and oddly approachable like only an oddly good guy Gandolfini can be, the film finds yet another great scene with Galdolfini's moment in the spotlight.The film also finds a great source of energy from Brad Pitt's Floyd. He never really gets a scene to himself, rather he is always a supporting character. That said, he is hysterical as a druggy who is always high. Letting the gangsters know Clarence's every move while offering them drugs the whole time, Floyd is a real gem of a character. No surprise he inspired Pineapple Express given how well he would fit in that film. The best moment with Floyd comes as a gangster pulls a gun causing a delayed, high reaction from Pitt as he mutters, \"Woah.\"Yet, the stars here are Christian Slater and Patricia Arquette. Less compelling than the rest of the supporting cast, their twisted love story is one only Tarantino could concoct. In essence, it is a dry run for Natural Born Killers without the constantly bloodshed and via the direction of Tony Scott. Thus, it is less coked up and more restrained than Oliver Stone's film. Though less interesting than the other characters, their Bonnie & Clyde-esque matchup of a hooker with a heart of gold and a lonely man with limited romantic experience is somehow charming and sweat. True Romance is a film that violently argues that, to love somebody, you must kill for them. Clarence and Alabama pull the trigger for one another, in the most romantic acts ever and in an attempt to be Elvis (Val Kilmer) cool.Kinetic, insane, and thoroughly Tarantino, the film is not really a Tony Scott film. Yet, his assured hand does help keep it a bit more restrained without descending into complete parody. With a tremendous cast that all nail their roles, True Romance is a very good film that is simply fun and somehow romantic.",

Yes, people are huge fans of this and consider it a cult classic and the script is written by Quentin Tarantino since he did his directing debut on Reservoir Dogs and he also write the script for it. True Romance has it's Quentin Tarantino style to the story and the directing style is by Tony Scott even it had some violence that are intense are really enjoyable. It had a huge cast in this. Christian Slater and Patricia Arquette are Clarence Worley and Alabama Whitman, the two couple who are married after going to the movies to watch a kung fu film. Dennis Hopper plays Clarence's father. Val Kilmer plays an Elvis Presley apparition who is a conscience to Clarence like he is on his mind because Clarence an Elvis Presley fanatic. And then we have Gary Oldman as the pimp, Drexl, who Alabama used to work with. Even if I've heard of this movie cause' I'm a fan of old stuff, the realistic violence is got to be the highlight of the film. I just love s**t like that. As it is, the film is a cult favourite for the people and it kind of reminds them of the film made by Quentin Tarantino because of the stylish look of violence. What more can I say? It's Quentin Tarantino's script. I love True Romance, it's tremendous.",

Who better than the director of Top Gun to bring an arrested adolescents fantasy to life? Scott verges on self-parody in terms of the gloss and pace he brings to proceedings, giving the movie a relentless energy that never allows the audience to stop and consider the absurdity of it all.\r Alabamas execution of Virgil, complete with feral scream and lovingly photographed, blood-soaked breasts, earned the film notoriety and a run-in with the censors, although Scotts approach to the material is best summed up by another, less controversial creative decision. The script has Clarences initial drug-hawking meeting with Elliot take place, unremarkably enough, in a zoo, but the director wanted something with a little more pizzazz, so he set the sequence on a rollercoaster. Tarantino is overstating the case when he compares Scott to undervalued auteurs of the past (Douglas Sirk he aint), but theres no doubt he was perfect to orchestrate this wild ride.\r This is not only an immensely entertaining violent action but genuinely romantic at times. Tarantino's dialogue is as sparkling as ever.\r A True Masterpiece.",

True Romance is a perfect example of how you can't make a good film out of a bad script. Tarantino's degeneracy oozes through the dialogue and obcene violence. His racism and misogeny particularly apparent in this stinker. It's well directed by the late Tony Scott, but a lot of this is undone by the poor editing. There is a strong scene between Walken and Hopper, but the use of the n-word leaves a bad taste, particularly when this was an annecdote Tarantino used to tell at parties.",

It's one of the flicks Tarantino has ever written and Tony Scott has ever filmed. Filled with romance, inspired characters, solid charasmatic performances and ultra violence this is without a doubt one of my favorite films. The film tells the tale of Alabama played by an amazing Patricia Arquette and Clarence a \"so cool\" Christian Slater in possibly his best performance. Shes a call girl his friends hire for him. They immediately fall in love and he tries to free her from her violent pimp played by a surprising Gary Oldman. It of course goes wrong and he ends up grabbing the wrong suitcase, one filled with cocaine. They of course go on down to Hollywood to try and sell it and before they know it they have the cops, the mafia and a bunch of criminals after them. The movie is well written the screenplay is smart and overly romantic with some great comedy and action. And it's all just so well executed by Tony Scott. It's really one of the best films ever. Although it floundered at the box office it has since found a most deserved cult following.

The director Tony Scott fails to comprehend Tarantino's script and as a result this love bash feels effortful and messy. But I wouldn't just blame Scott to make sense in a film so teenage-ish as such. Not that we haven't had good films in such genre, it's just that the goofiness isn't motivated as those films do and are. And Tarantino is to be put on trial too. Maybe, if he was there, in the director's seat, he might have carved it out in one rhythmic beat. Even though the script and the characters journey might constraint it. The best thing film does is not feeling obligated to explain the falling in love aspect of these characters.It is instant. Either it happens or not and when it does, that is it. There's no clause, no explanation and no boundary. Now, in a film that is basically a chase scene, it is extremely bold and outrageous for Scott to expect us to have a conversation. That liberty comes only when the rush is dragged and not pushed by the film. To a script that zooms its way out, Scott had to focus not only on the stops, the stillness of the storyline but also on the emergencies.On performance objective, the cast is a topsy-turvy dream. Samuel L. Jackson, Gary Oldman, James Gandolfini, Brad Pitt and Christopher Walken are supporting the lead in the form of guest appearances. But what still works, is those same little delights of chocolates that we receive periodically in the film fooling us in believing that it is in safe hands. True Romance is another product that came out from Tarantino's press that communicates with young couple with a robust argument and his signature ruffian violence.",
