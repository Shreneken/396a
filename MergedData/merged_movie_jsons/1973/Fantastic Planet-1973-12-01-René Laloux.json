            "content": "A delightful, original an odd French-Czechoslovakian animation movie by Rene Laloux that wan Cannes Jury's award in 1974.The 2-D animation is something that you can expect from the seventies, but it is very original and innovative for the time. It has the detail and charm of all good illustration books, and, despite the limits in movement, the characters are very expressive and beautifully drawn, as well as the landscapes. The world and atmospheres created by Laloux are superb, both familiar and strange. The Recipe? Mix Dali surreal landscapes, Bosch architecture and fauna/flora creatures, add a hint of 19th century botanical drawings, slowly pour some Pink Floyd-ish music, and whisk all energetically with a fat-free faux-mythological metaphorical story, and you have The Savage Planet, which is the original title of the movie in French.The story is very interesting and has many possible interpretations and readings: the role of humans in Nature, cohabitation and coexistence of different species and political systems, what makes different species superior and savage, among others. I found funny that the people in the story are called Oms (French word for people is Hommes and it sounds the same as Oms), and the main character is called Terr (the name of earth in French is Terre and sounds the same as Terr).The main problem with the story and the characters is that they are not always engaging as they don't transmit enough emotion or feeling to the viewer. The viewer doesn't feel empathy towards the poor suffering human pets or towards the aliens, the first because they really act like a pest, and the second because they are too spiritual and developed to tolerate others than themselves. This is all intended, but still frigidly expressed. The lack of thrill is what kills the movie.Nevertheless, this is one of those animation movies that everybody should see, full of imagination, talent, and landmarks in Animation. A cult movie that deserves the cult. Unique.",

            "review_title": "Well-known French psychedelic animation",
            "content": "Animations like this are quite rare, especially after Disney created a near monopoly on animation circuit (something that, despite the high quality of their animations in general, nevertheless lead to one of the world's most frustrating assumptions: that \"cartoons\" are solely for kids). This is a surrealist French animation from the 70s, and that's pretty much the sum-up of its description: Surreal, 70s, and French.\"Fantastic Planet\" is a science fiction film about a world inhabited by Traags (large blue alien species) and Oms (human creatures that are regarded as pests and pets by the colossal Traags), along with other interesting and bizarre creatures like something out of Dr. Seuss. The Traags aren't necessarily evil, though they're the antagonists. They treat the Oms just like humans treat mice, as pests and occasionally pets, and the depictions of the Traags' treatments of their pets really is not that far removed from how humans truly do treat their pets as well. One Om, Terr, manages to escape from his Traag mistress and steal her \"headphones\" which help imprint all of Traag knowledge. He meets up with wild Oms and, with the headphone device, manages to create an uprising against the Traags.Not only psychedelic, the intent was political in nature, though by these days the movie has toned down a bit. It is in fact a really pretty animation because of its use of colors and design, which for me is a lot more interesting than its historical value. For fans of animation of different types, it's a must see, but also for those who crave the underground psychedelic aspects of the 70s era and have worn out their DVDs of Fritz the Cat and The Yellow Submarine, this provides a charming alternative.--PolarisDiB",

One thing that I have noticed boldly is that the story successfully intends to explain the analytical capabilities among both advanced societies and undeveloped ones are almost the same. I won't go further in order to avoid spoiling the movie. However, I strongly recommend to consider political aspects while watching it.\nThis was defiantly a unique experience for me, more like a conversation with people who care about history of civilizations and future of humans in different societies. I am very pleased and thankful to those who have made it possible for me to watch this unique animation. Considering the time it has been made, almost everything was great.",

The film is called \" Fantastic Planet \" and is perhaps one of the finest examples of creative journalism ever. It tells the story of Terr (Eric Baugin and Jean Valmont) who's life literally begins on the run. His mother, Indeed, the entire race of fleeing Humans are not the dominate species on the planet. Hardly, the Humans are tiny when compared with the giant size Draags who rule the world. On this Alien sphere, the Draags consider the little humans, whom they call Oms, both charming play toys and at the same time, a pesky, intrusive and troubling nuisance. After losing his mother, Terr is adopted and accepted as a household pet by a female Draag. Despite being little more than a toy, Terr is nevertheless able to learn enough to escape and eventually mature into an adult Om. Later he meets other Oms, one of which is called Tiwa (Jennifer Drake). As time passes, the Oms become so dangerous to the Draags, that they decide to eradicate the entire race of humans. However, the Oms, having become aware of the plan, hurry to find and exploit the Draags' one main weakness. Failure means extinction, success promises to change the world of both. The film is certainly unique and its moral offering is not lost on the thinking and compassionate viewer. Subtitles make for a hindrance, but it's importance message allows it to stand on its own laurels as an all time Classic. ****",

            "review_title": "one of the trippiest things you'll ever see, bar none, and it's extraordinary in its simplicity",
            "content": "Fantastic Planet has about a hundredth of the technical proficiency- or just money- that any given Pixar film might have in just its first couple of reels. But there's probably just as much invention and eye-popping mind-blowing madness, if not exponentially more-so, than any recent CGI film. It's, well, art. Yes, to throw a word as big and all-encompassing like that is tricky, Fantastic Planet qualifies as some kind of weird artistic feat of surrealism and pure science fiction. And by sci-fi I mean the cream of the crop in storytelling and ideas: it's about the impact of images in a strange land being somehow completely relatable, if only in social construct or satirical forms, as though we were witnessing Gullivers Travels mixed around with Dune and then filtered through some renegade animator that got through the gates at a studio and churned something out fast. It's like a strange revelation that won't leave your mind.And yes, leave no mistake, it also works very well as a \"stoner movie\", one of those ridiculously warped visions that goes into the world of the imagination so heavily, with tangential moments in scenes (the 'blending' of the Draags in one scene, the constant flow of various monsters, the 'mating' ritual, the de-Oming), with a soundtrack that's like a outstanding, unlikely collaboration between Isaac Hayes and Pink Floyd (you don't know whether it'll split into Dark Side or Shaft). Premise is simple: a little oprhaned Om named Terr is taken in as a 'pet' of Tiwa, and is half tortured half loved by her. But, as case happens, she outgrows him, and he runs away after being filled with knowledge by some machine. Then he gets sucked into the underground world of the Oms, where there's lots of mating and other activities, such as fights (wacko scene with those teeth-filled monsters strapped on like Gonzo gladiators). But their civilization is in peril, and it's time to fight back! Lots of classic myths pumped in, but at times you almost forget there's story, which might be half the point. The director Rene Laloux, along with collaborators like Roland Topor, creates a world unequivocally unto itself, where there are real strokes with pencils and colors and inks, where it seems very much like a collection of pictures from some obscure European fable book for kids, only loaded with some kind of life-force that moves like no other animated film (maybe it's slightest, closest-distant relative is Yellow Submarine, which is still a stretch). Characters move in and out occasionally like a Terry Gilliam short- giant hand and other objects placed in almost jokingly, which makes it a lot of fun at times- and there's something eerie in Laloux's dedication to pushing the expectation-level, mainly because, as noted, we haven't seen this style before. It's a quiet form of sensationalism, where it sneaks up on the viewer, and then takes over a scene, growing little by little, like some weird plant.In short, he does his job as a genre director, probably on par with the great visionaries, while using some primitive methods of animation. But through imperfections there's more expressive tendencies, moments of chance and random visions like a monster springing organically about to eat another, or to go through bizarre mating rituals as Venus de Milo statues with blue heads. Or, in other words, as my long-winded adulation goes to say, a superb \"stoner movie\". Not that being sober will make you absorbed any less; it's a compliment, in a sense, that in its glory of its time it reaches a true cult impulse, where children can enjoy its wonderful glimpses of the \"fantastic\", and adults can have another more mature, thought-provoking input in its implications on power and human nature.",

Although I appreciate animations like Finding Nemo or the Incredibles for they represent a renewal of the genre (in the same way the Disney movie did in the 50's), the artistic style of La Planete Sauvage is unmistakable and accords perfectly with the dark atmosphere of the movie. This animation is based on the book Oms (a deformation of the french word homme, man) from the French SciFi writer Stephan Wul who should also be credited for being the writer of The Time Masters (another SciFi animation worth your time). Wul's real name is still a mystery. The rare things we know about his life are that he wrote his 10 (or so) only books when he was studying dentistry at the University. He apparently graduated and became too busy to continue his writing activity. What a pity. I've read most of Wul's book and they are all unique and beautiful. The animation sticks true to Wul's vision. The art by the Czech master Topor is dark and oppressing, despite the bright color of the 60-70's-influenced graphism, adding to the uncomfort of seeing human beings treated as pets or pests by giant extraterrestrials. However, the roles are interchangeable and humans do behave too often in the way the extraterrestrials do in the movie with other living creatures on Earth. Hard to find but worth the search.",

For one thing I loved how unique it was, and the storytelling is mostly to thank for that. The story is an original one, and holds some very interesting concepts without preaching.Also engaging are the characters. They are simple, but you do empathise with them especially Terr who moved me rightly from minute one. The animation is by far the best asset, it is absolutely fantastic, with beautiful backgrounds, stunning colours and well-modelled characters. The music is beautiful, poignant and haunting as well and the writing is top notch.The voice acting does very well to fit with the characters and it is also sensitive and also succeeds in making the characters even more likable than they are. The English dubbing is good, but I find the original one more emotive and poetic. In fact, my only gripe with Fantastic Planet is that there are times when it does drag, but overall it is a unique and quite fantastic film. 9/10 Bethany Cox",

It will please fans of hard-core science fiction (not fantasy), and will seduce fans of animation (not just 3D animation, animation in general terms) with its mix of Czech style animation and illustration.It is a good movie, but not a masterpiece. The narrative treads the science fiction tropes too strictly and ends up painting characters and events predictably when the setup seems to suggest something more interesting. In fact, I was very disappointed that the most developed and interesting relationship in the whole film is traded off for a kind of boring resistance story that does its best to not let the audience make connections with the characters. It is not picked up or revisited later... and none of the subsequent character interplay is as interesting or meaningful.Where this film excels is in its weirdness and imagination. Strange and horrible creations are brought to life and move/eat/gestate/exist in ways that will make you go 'ew' and 'wow' at the same time. This is helped by the strong European styling of the animation (mostly limited in movement) and illustration, which reminded me of studio Zagreb..There is something so mysterious about the atmosphere of this film - it may just grab you. Definitely watch it for the disturbing and somehow touching relationship between Tiva and Terr - you'll only wish there was more of it.",

However, domesticated Om Terr manages to escape from his Draag master Tiwa and joins up with a tribe of wild Oms who Terr encourages to learn all about the Oms and their culture with the help of a special learning device.Director/co-writer Rene Laloux and co-writer Roland Topor use the quirky and compelling premise as a means to state a powerful message not only on the intrinsic evil and cruelty of one race totally subjugating another race (the de-Om sequence with numerous Oms being slaughtered in mass volume is genuinely nightmarish and disturbing), but also on how enlightenment and liberation go hand in hand. The Draags register well as a convincingly odd extraterrestrial race. Moreover, the vivid and fascinating depiction of a hostile planet populated by all kinds of dangerous and predatory creatures rates as this film's key triumph. The nifty stylized animation offers a wealth of striking and surreal images. Alain Goraguer's funky-digging score hits the right-on groovy spot. Although slightly marred by an annoying abrupt conclusion, this film still overall deserves its cult status.",

Well, I rented 'The Cell' and while I was watching the scene where Jennifer Lopez is in her house with the television on, I noticed those blue aliens and the memories came rushing back!  Of course, I came to IMDB to figure out what the title of the film was (it was in the trivia section of 'The Cell' review), and I was pleasantly surprised to find the title.  I went and bought the DVD, which is truly outstanding! The basic premise of the movie is that a race of aliens keeps domesticated humans as pets, while eliminating their feral brethren in the wild.  The story centers around Terr, who is rescued from a pack of cruel alien children by the daughter of a high-ranking official.  Eventually he runs away and ends up meeting the humans living in the wild.  They become tired of the treatment they suffer at the hands of the alien race, and seek to exact revenge on their captors.This movie was made nearly 30 years ago, so the animation is not really comparable to modern-day animation, but the story and the plot transcend time.  The premise of the film is as valid today as it was in the 70s.The DVD edition of the movie comes with three additional animated shorts by Rene Laloux, and they are just as entertaining.

The story makes its symbolic content as obvious as it can.Given that this feature came out in 1973, it was a magnificent achievement. It was a time when not only was movie animation just about dead, but TV animation was pretty dire too.

It's better than Tideland though... The animations were made with a low budget and rather static but do what they're supposed to do with only one part that is too repetitive (with the cannons). Imaginative design makes up for sometimes crudely drawn characters. The drawing style has a certain old-fashioned quality to it at times, as if you're watching an illustrated children's bible (but with some boob hanging out here and there and some violence that could give some kids nightmares).

Roland Topor is a french artist with a great sense of fantasy. He designed most of all you can see on the screen. The animation was produced in Czechoslovakia because there always have been excellent animation studios in this country, and also because producing in France was far too expensive. This story takes place in the past. It is a metaphor of the man's history. The small characters are called \"Oms\". This word is pronounced like the french word \"Hommes\" that means \"man\". It tell us when man had to leave the original heaven. Man had to fight against his old masters to be independent and free, then he had to find his place in the universe.

            "content": "Rene Laloux's \"La Planete Sauvage\" refuses to disappear from the cinematic landscape, and for those who haven't seen it yet - lucky you! - it is hard at first to understand why. Certainly the film owes none of its longevity to any groundbreaking techniques, or star-packaging. It succeeds because of a constant, virtuoso tension between concept and execution, and as such, the beauty of the film is its refusal to give in to your expectations.Fantastic Planet sees mankind acting as either mere pets or vermin to a colossal race of blue humanoids. Upon reading this you'd expect to overlords to be cruel and arrogant, and they manage to be even more frightening by being relatively benign yet unfathomably different from us at the same time. Laloux refuses to judge the aliens, just as he refuses to romanticize the human lead, or his new comrades. A later attempt at extermination is treated with the cold detachment of pest control.Although it would actually be interesting to watch a gifted modern filmmaker have a go at this plot with a significant budget and contemporary technology, they would be hard-pressed to convey the level of unease primal dread conveyed by Laloux's deceptively simple visuals. The look is scarce but each touch hits its mark, whether it be the blank faces of the Draags, the skin-colored Bosch-inspired landscapes, or the weird vignettes of cruelty within the planet's warped animal kingdom. Add to that a dreamy score by Alain Goraguer and you end up with a film that, when it's unnerving you, is just balls-to-the-wall trippy.Over 40 years on, it is still refreshing to behold a film that sits at the polar opposite of the lushness of a Miyazaki or Disney, one that possibly jump-started the era of animation as a medium of ideas that would later give us the likes of Ghost in the Shell and Jin Roh.

But Fantastic Planet isn't just adult. Its also ambitious because of its surreal style. Fantastic Planet is one-of-a-kind, and freaking weird.We are in a sci-fi world. But nothing meets expectations. Humans are dominated by giant blue aliens, kept as pets. These Draags are more advanced than us, but their devices are strange, stuff that'd never be useful in real life. There's hardly a regular moment in the film. Funny clothing, strange customs, nefarious devices, disturbing flora and fauna. In terms of creativity, I believe this is #1.The other elements also compliment the style perfectly. The animation uses both traditional and stop-motion animation, giving the film a jerky pace. The soundtrack is pure 70s psychedelic. An appropriate tune for something impossible to fully comprehend. You get immersed in the experience.However, a fair warning - this movie is the epitome of style-over-substience. The characters are weak, and the message is ancillary at best.

The story is simple and allegorical (which is more obvious when the French origin of some of the names is considered): the tiny Oms are tolerated as pets but ultimately seen as vermin by the towering, spiritual Draags. The imagery is outstanding: colourful, stylized, imaginative, and surreal. Not surprisingly, the movie had a rep (at least in my circles) of being best watched while stoned. I remember seeing this in the theatres in the 70's (straight) and the final images of the dancing statues stuck with me for decades. Definitely worth watching, if only for the artful (albeit not very 'hard scientific') depiction of an alien world. Note: the animated humanoid characters are frequently partially nude.",

In fact, the main character practically disappears during the final act. Additionally, while the sights of alien plant and animal life show a great deal of creativity, we are treated to far too many of them.  Such sequences are great for establishing a sense of place, but should have been cut closer to the end of the film.As an interesting final note, the theme of knowledge overcoming power, and particularly the use of a \"knowledge machine\" suspiciously appeared later in L.

Set on the planet Ygam where the Oms (humans) are wild pests and domestic pets of the Draags, intellectual beings who tower above them. One Om escapes with a Draag learning device and uses it to assist other Oms to rise up and revolt against their overlords.There seems to be an analogy embedded within the narrative but I personally don't think the story is especially important or interesting. What this film is all about is the look and feel. The animation is truthfully very basic but the art work is beautiful. The fantastical world created here is a work of true creative imagination. Amongst many other things, we have the giant blue Draags with their red eyes who meditate and are carried sky-ward in bubbles, there are tall elaborate plants, weird creatures who produces pink foam which in turn generates clothing for the Oms, there is a giant winged creature and a planet of headless statues. All this visual invention is accompanied by a great sound design of alien sounds accompanied by a score of light prog rock.

This giant blue people keep humans, who to them are smaller than mice, as pets. The movie focuses on one giant girl and her pet human, and the movie beautifully conveys the weird mix of love and casual cruelty children can show their pets. As a human, one's sympathy is natural with the humans, but I wouldn't say the giants were evil; to them, humans are pretty much like rodents are to us, and while they think the humans might be intelligent, or at least their ancestors were, they aren't sure.The more allegorical elements feel a little flat, and the English dub suffers from weak acting, and if you're used to Pixar and Disney, the very simple animation can sometimes seem a little underwhelming, but the imagination is so strong that no fan of animation should miss this.",

            "content": "I'm not much of a fan of fantasy. A friend, however, brought this film to my attention because he said he couldn't get the story out of his head, and made further comments that piqued my curiosity.Well, it didn't kill me to see the film and I'm happy to say that it was worth my time \u2013 for a number of reasons. First, the mise-en-scene is quite imaginative with absolutely surreal environments that I think owe a lot to the imagery of Monty Python; nothing wrong in copying \u2013 everybody does it, anyway.Second, it's a fairly simple story about the oppression and exploitation of the masses in a fantastic society somewhere in the cosmos. To that extent, it's an allegory for any situation that results in a clash between opposing cultures, different societies and so on. It's given a new slant here, though, by portraying humanity \u2013 called the Oms \u2013 as the oppressed who are exploited by blue giants, known as the Traag. The plot follows the exploits of one male Om who, after learning all about the Traag, escapes from them to rouse the other Oms to mount a rebellion.Finally, however, the most intriguing aspect about this film is the clear connection between it and other sci-fi and fantasy films. For example, the discordant sounds in this film are, I think, a direct copy of those I heard in The Forbidden Planet (1957). As noted already, the whole scenario owes much to the Monty Python TV series. And for sure, I think, James Cameron copied the idea of a giant tree sanctuary from this film for inclusion in his epic Avatar (2009). Cameron, of course, reversed the oppressed-oppressor roles of humanity and the blue giants for his story.Moreover, here's a way-out thought: being a French production and seeing as how the French just love Hollywood westerns, I was amused to see the 'outlaw' Oms run for cover to a tiny hole in a wall \u2013 a long, blank, gigantic solid wall \u2013 much like how the real Butch Cassidy and his outlaws retreated to what was known as The Hole-in-the-Wall Gang hideout in the late nineteenth century. Too much of a stretch for you? Then think about why the writers here also included a Hollow Bush Gang of Oms who acted as enemies of the rebellious Oms in the Tree of Life sanctuary who wanted to escape from the Traag.Actually, I also think that The Hollow Bush Gang is a metaphor for the Gang with No Brains, as you will see \u2013 in contrast to the rebellious Oms who figured out how to escape from Traag domination. Knowledge, after all, is power and so forth...And, for something even more off the wall: long ago, Edgar Rice Burroughs (famous for Tarzan and others) wrote sci-fi stories about Mars. In one of those stories, there were headless humanoids that could function only when a head slithered into position between the shoulders. So watch for a brazen copy of that idea in this film.I guess kids today would find the graphics and imagery quite rudimentary when compared to the current technology of mind-blowing CGI action. Too bad \u2013 their loss.If you ever come across it on TV or on DVD, you could do lot worse with a couple of your hours, I guess. As a piece of cinema history, it is worth seeing; and I'm glad I did.Give it seven stars for the imagery and overall effort.January 26, 2012",

            "content": "I hope you might like Fantastic Planet if you're a fan of Don Hertzfeldt and World of Tomorrow. It's a bit less obtuse than World of Tomorrow, but in style and narrative, there are some parallels. Ren\u00e9 Laloux directed Fantastic Planet with Roland Topor production design and it tells the story of a distant planet Ygam in the future, ruled by blue giant creatures called Draags. There are people in this world, but they are called Oms, and they are the Draags ' dogs. A Draag named Master Sinh adopts a single Om boy named Terr. The Draag has a special device or headband to help them learn by osmosis. The Draags eventually lose interest in Terr and he escapes with a headband that allows him access to the apprenticeship. He eventually joins a group of other Oms who are routinely managed by the Draags using tactics of population control. The story goes from there but I will not give away any more. From that story summary, I'm sure you can tell that Fantastic Planet won't be for everyone. It has a 70's psychedelic look and some moments are definitely surreal (but if you ask me in an artistically interesting manner). But if you can persevere through the strangeness, in its allegory about community thinking, rituals, sexism, population control, peace and education, the film has interesting things to say. Fantastic Planet is an adult nudity animated film, but more like watching a film with natives of a particular culture in a tribal setting. In no way is it salacious; while reproduction is part of the allegory. It may also be bloody. How completely different it is is part of the joy of watching Fantastic Planet. I love Roland Topor's special animation and production design. It was made using animation for cutout stop motion, a technique that I haven't seen many times. I really like the vibrancy of the colors on top of the backgrounds and how the sketches move. Considering this style, the colors are surprisingly deep. I think when you see as many animated movies as I do, it's exciting to see something so new. I like Alain Goraguer's music too, which is surreal and weird without being overbearing. Roger Corman, renowned for making and directing independent horror movies such as the original Little Shop of Horrors in 1960, Swamp Women and Attack of the Crab Monsters, produced Fantastic Planet in the United States. I can see why somebody would be drawn to Fantastic Planet with his tastes. There are chilling moments and yet the film feels small and reflective.",

Whether it is class separation and struggles, the freeing from slavery with the underdog now being able to reward themselves the fruits of their labor, the ants and grasshopper along with many other stories and themes.However I think this story also reflects some of the oldest stories mankind has thought about. Even as early as the Sumerian and/or Babylonian myths of the Anunnaki and the rebellions. Adam and Eve eating from the Tree of Knowledge then being cast out from the Garden of Eden. Along with other myths from Greeks and Romans. Understanding that to evolve as a species, one must have the education to further technology but at the same time not to be a slave and a lazy product of that technology or else that species would be a victim to which they just defeated whether if it is physical, mental, ideological and so forth.This animated film contains a multitude of concepts for which future similar stories can't fully capture.Its good for multiple age ranges and one can make it as easy or as complex as one sees fit",

This planet truly is odd. Additionally, the story has some interesting elements as well. But, on the flip side, the animation quality is just horrible and sometimes the film seems weird just for the sake of being weird. It is definitely NOT a film that the typical person would enjoy!!As far as the animation goes, I think part of the problem was when it was made. Quality standards in the 60s and 70s for animation slipped drastically compared to the great 1940s and 50s. Cell-counts now had dropped and sloppy drawings were becoming more and more acceptable--and this is very evident in \"Fantastic Planet\". The number of cells per second is so low that instead of appearing animated, at times it looks more like a slide show! And, often almost everything is non-animated and only an arm of mouth moves--again, this is very poor. What is amazing is that this film took five years to animate. You'd think this would result in a great looking film--and in this case you would clearly be wrong! To me, the animation is simply ugly. So, if I hated the animation so much, why do I still give the film a 5? Well, the story is pretty cool, though the ending is really, really rushed. In this strange world, it's ruled by the Draags--gigantic strange looking blue beings. They are intelligent and technologically advanced but spend a lot of their time meditating and doing very little that is obviously useful. Their pets are the Ohms--which appear to be itsy-bitsy humans. The Draags view them like we'd view rats--making some pets and occasionally exterminating large colonies. This makes you think about our own pets and how we treat them! I'd say more, but it's really just something you need for yourself--rushed ending and all.

But with watching it longer time eventually did I realize that oms and deras symbolize the history of Europeans colonizing the unindustrialized ethnics and enslave some of them ,exploiting their resources unlimitedly while treating them like they do to pets, manipulating the whole race. Not until the rebellions took place did they reflected what they had done,cause they just took the present logic of how the world worked as granted.After some terror, they decided to live peacefully with each other and divide the work with more equality ,whcih from my perspective follows the tide of human history .\nIt's worth mentioning that the end where oms found the fatal blow to deras was to destroy them when they were making love through contemplating ,I think it reflects the foundation of the so-called highly civilized culture is fragile and delicate,and after some tremendous change should it be rebuilt.\nAnyway this is an appealing animation to me,and I may rewatch it some time.",

Stiff dialogue, poor characterizations, and an all around feeling of aloofness bury the film from the get-go.

From its cut-out, paper-doll animation; to its ugly and nonsensical story of survival and revenge; to its \"far-from-likable\" characters - Fantastic Planet certainly could've been a helluva lot better than it inevitably was.Even though the decidedly diminutive humans (aka. Oms) were the ones being portrayed as the oppressed underdogs in the story, I, for one, found it pretty difficult to root for their victory when they stood their ground in an all-out revolt against the red-eyed, blue-skinned giants known as Draags.Yes. Fantastic Planet did, indeed, contain some very bizarre and trippy looking imagery at times, but, in the long run, this certainly wasn't near enough to save its story from deteriorating into a monotonous bore long before its 70-minute running time was up.Apparently this French production won itself a jury prize (whatever that was) at Cannes.Anyways - Even though I would honestly be quite reluctant to recommend Fantastic Planet to others, I would say that it was at least worth one viewing.",

The moral is decent enough, but hardly very original.The visual design aspect falls halfway between Terry Gilliam's work in Monty Python and Heinz Edelmann's production design for Yellow Submarine. This aspect is, perhaps, the most successful part of the film but, again, hardly that original.The animation itself is most disappointing, being very limited - many scenes are presented as a static image with just one small element animated (just the mouth on a face, for instance).And after all these years, too.

As I was young at the time I was perpetually bored and disappointed in its inability to develop any suspense adequate enough to hold my attention. Lo and behold, I come across this while browsing Youtube. Since I love mystical animation my intrigue led me to watch this full length feature.Cool animation cannot save this story due to an incoherent plot with inexplicable characters, creepy-cool creatures and surreal imagery. Apparently, this is a parable designed to serve as a morality tale against societal supremacy practiced by groups. But this heavy-handed interpretation is too simplistic and moronic to be able to tackle such a complex subject of bigotry and conflict between people, let alone fictitious creatures. As a child, I was left with that empty feeling one gets when they may be too naive or young to comprehend the hidden messages of an intellectual fable. But perhaps I was more wise than I gave myself credit for as a youth.Fantastic Planet attempts to use parallels of oppression reminiscent of Nazi Germany and White colonialism, but we are left with platitudes that can only be pitched to the lowest common mindset for biased and uninformed minds. There is also some unnecessary usage of nudity that hasn't any purpose but to titillate older viewers, thus alienating and humiliating a child audience. This 72 minute excursion into a lower surreal world of horror drags along at a pretty deliberate pace that proves the lack of content cannot uphold a feature length film. This film also has an overall sinister feeling that only puts off an engaged viewer.",

Then you cast into the future or some fantasy realm with exaggerations in a sort of exploration. In the worst case, its satire. In the very best, say Phil Dick, it can be an open essay on selfawareness.Then of course, there's the third step, all the elaborations of this fantasy or future world. Again, there's the worst case where they merely amuse and give the general feeling of otherworldliness. And the best case where each detail of the world somehow elaborates on the curlicues of the essay.What we have here is the worst case in the first two, but done well. We have the kind of obvious, blunt social problem that only an enslaved people would think worthy of elaboration. We have that elaboration similarly bluntly: two races, blind conflict, etc. Its all at the \"Animal Farm\" level, which is to say the fifth grade. Just recalling it has a dumbing effect.It is in the third component that this is interesting. Czechs are not strong thinkers when they encounter something directly. They slide in from the side. Its those side things that cut. Even Kafka. His supposedly big ideas, the obvious ones are only a disguise for all the concept fleas he is able to carry on them.And all those notions are visual here, purely cinematic, which is a joy. In fact, its better to watch this in a different language than you speak. You won't miss anything story-wise and be able to focus on some of the visual notions tried out here.Not all of them impress of course: for instance there's the bizarre case of the gremlin in a cage that catches birds with its tongue, shakes them dead and discards them. The area is strewn with these corpses, blossomlike while the gremlin giggles. Some guy came to work one day with this idea and nailed it in wherever.But there are other visual notions that strike. The advanced race indulges in group meditations where manipulative stingers come from the walls of the room and literally mix their bodies. That by itself is pretty strong. Whether group conceptsex or individual, little bubbles or mind-souls drift out of their bodies to the heavens, literally a moon (their \"Fantastic Planet\") There, these mindbubbles join with huge headless robots with the specific purpose of having sex (which is shown as \"dancing\"). This is also how they reproduce, by mechanisms not explained. The idea is so visual, so rich, so strangely evocative it makes this otherwise dreary thing worth watching.Apparently it is often paired with \"Yellow Submarine\" which has none of the fleas.Ted's Evaluation -- 3 of 3: Worth watching.",

It takes place on an alien planet where the \"giants\" rule and keep \"oms\" as pets. The \"giants\" are large blue alien creatures that somewhat resemble humans as well as the \"idols\" of the Aztec and Incan period. The \"oms\" are humans, which are either domestic or wild. The problem with the \"oms\" is that they reproduce like roaches. When Tiwa, a young giant girl, adopts an \"om\" and becomes quite fond of him, she carries him with her always. Tiwa's father gives her an electromagnetic collar with remote for her \"om\" so that when he flees from her, she can pull him back by the use of her remote control. The method of learning for these \"giants\" is by listening to the \"knowledge headphones,\" and since Tiwa's \"om\" has on this special collar, he, too, receives all of the knowledge that Tiwa does from the headphones. He soon becomes fluent in the \"giants\" language and learns of their hideous plan to wipe out the wild \"oms.\" He escapes Tiwa's care and steals the headphones. He seeks the wild \"oms\" and shares the knowledge from the headphones with the \"om\" tribes. There is a battle between \"giants\" and \"oms,\" and the details included are quite enthralling.

The stealing of the headset that allows the Oms' access to the Draags' knowledge is an interesting reversal of Eve stealing the apple from the tree of knowledge in the Old Testament; here, knowledge is critical.

I should start by saying that the version I saw was in the French language with subtitles, but there is a version dubbed into English featuring The Rocky Horror Picture Show's Barry Bostwick. Anyway, basically the story takes place on the planet Ygam, ruled by the giant blue humanoid aliens known as the Draags, and there are also the tiny human slaves called the Oms. A baby Om is orphaned by the Draags killing its mother, and Draag daughter Tiwa (Jennifer Drake) takes the child as her pet, with the permission of her father Master Sinh (Jean Topart). Even though he has a collar on him, the Om child that grows, Terr (Eric Baugin, then Jean Valmont) likes spending time with his \"owner\", but he realises other Oms are being killed at random. Terr escapes from the Draag world and travels through desert land until he eventually finds the Om world and joins the tribe. When escaping, Terr managed to steal a headphone set that contains and feeds all the knowledge of the planet and the Draags directly into the brain. Armed with this technological knowledge the Oms build all the weapons and equipment they need as they plan to defend themselves against their giant enemy. In the end though, the Draags and Oms have killed many of each other in big numbers, but they both step down from attacking each other and find some sort of peace, as far as I remember. I was intrigued by how similar the animation was to style of Monty Python, the bounciness of how characters, objects and creatures move across the screen, and the (unintentionally) funny shapes and looks of these things. I was very surprised by how much this film takes you into this surreal and stunningly visual world, complete with some assisting music and impressive sound effects creation, it is a fantastic French/Czech animated science-fiction fantasy.

Here the giant blue Draags rule. They're technologically and mentally advanced. The humans, known here as Oms, are considered to be like small animals. They're tolerated when Draag children keep them as pets, but colonies of them in the wild are considered vermin to be exterminated.We follow Terr as he learns about both Draag and Om society, and how they co-exist. All of that though is really an excuse to show off the wild alien landscape and the bizarre, anatomically preposterous creatures that populate the planet.I lost count of how many scenes there are of random bird/utensil/rocket hybrid creatures who arrive out of nowhere to visit chaos on the Oms. Screech! Graaaagh!The movie suggest we live in a chaotic universe, and mans only defence against random and/or capricious natural forces is knowledge, and the mastery it brings. It's also hard to miss the animal rights parallels - the Draags treats us like animals because they assume we don't have their level of sentience. Food for thought, eh?These are not your usual animated movie themes and for that, and it's blas\u00e8 attitude towards nudity, this announces itself as the French/Czech co-production it is - definitely not Disney fare.It's a short movie, just 72 minutes long, and it bounces along at a good pace - the next fight is never far away. This episodic nature, and the lack of characterisation (the film is more interested in the landscape than in its inhabitants) make for a film that is more visually and aurally fascinating than truly engaging but its sheer inventiveness and its arresting visual style make this a worthwhile watch.Perhaps this is how sci-fi might have been done if animation had not become associated with kids so long ago.",

I admit freely, early in this review, that a good portion of my enjoyment of the film stemmed from knowing these musicians took so much inspiration from the film. Still, there are merits of the film on its own. It's an artists picture not only because it was hand animated but because the form of the Draags are elegant, sexual and highlighted, without sweeping moments of sexuality. While a main theme of the film could be considered slavery, I was particularly taken with the idea of how a captive creature could learn. The world building is strong, from the Draag meditation to the beasts that terrorize the tiny Oms. The ending is unexpectedly peaceful, but maybe that goes to show that we sometimes need to be reminded that peace is a reasonable ending to a story. I give Fantastic Planet a 7/10.",

In many ways it feels like a fairy tale or child's allegory. This construct is the most enjoyable part of the film.It feels a bit like a story that C.S. Lewis might have written instead of Narnia had he been more of a secularist. The imagery is all very obvious and thinly veiled but rather than seeming to simple and analogy, the primary nature of the imagery is what makes it easy to enjoy and enter into. There is a certain joy that comes with knowing you understand exactly the point the director is making and simply watching it unfold.It creates a calming feeling in your mind that the film exploits to make its more shocking moments land like inevitable hammers. The shock is not so much that the thing happening is unexpected. It is more like they are shocking because they are seen coming a mile away yet they cannot be stopped.",

The emperor may be very well dressed in an animated style but he's still naked The story involves one of those well worn clich\u00e9d stories of an intelligent rather amoral race called Draags that is alien oppressing self aware cypher people called Oms who are obvious metaphors for humanity and a human leader called Ter leading a rebellion against the oppressors . Anyone expecting a Pierre Boulle type allegorical tale along the lines of \" get your damn paws off me you blue skinned bald fascist \" is going to be very disappointed . At some points the story almost seems to cross this track then it goes in to another meandering direction entirely And this is what tends to drag everything down , or to be more exact the problems are two fold . There's a completely esoteric aspect to the storytelling almost as if chunks from a novel is being adapted to screen but anyone without any knowledge of the source material will be bewildered as to the intricate meaning . I could quote large chunks of the dialogue but the IMDb system would reject this review as having constant and numerous spelling errors . In other words the audience will be left confused at the transcendental , mystical nonsense and technobabble on screen which takes obfuscation to new heights . The other fault is the rather lacuna and episodic nature of the story telling where things happen just because the animator thought it was a good idea at the time Some people might be impressed by the animation and I'm certainly not going to claim it's bad in anyway and was constantly reminded of the Terry Gilliam sequences from the TV series MONTY PHYTHON'S FLYING CIRCUS . certainly there's no way a film like this could have ever been brought to screen via live action but just because a film is surreal doesn't necessarily make it a great one and almost always a great film has to have a great story and this is not a great film",

The tone of the film does not treat the young protagonist's torture with solemnity, which I appreciate, because the first act is mostly from the enormous aliens' perspective, and, similarly, we do not understand the plight of insects when we play with them. The plot, while not exceedingly original, held my interest, because it was well-paced, and because the setting and characters that the plot used were so fascinating and new. My only real gripe with the story is that the ending is very rushed. *MILD SPOILERS* The narrative contents of the ending had the potential to be very satisfying, but we are not given enough time to feel.I would overall highly recommend this film to anyone, especially those seeking alternative animation.

And by placing our species in the latter role, it's able to make the audience relate & resonate to the injustice with a certain clarity. The plot is straightforward yet a lot brews underneath.What may turn some viewers away is the clinical approach & dryness in storytelling. The events just unfold like brief episodes but there is no natural flow to them, nor is there any proper build-up. The animation is wicked as the images look both dated & timeless for some reason. And the psychedelic score undoubtedly goes a long way in infusing a hypnotic quality to the whole proceedings.Overall, Fantastic Planet makes for a fascinating commentary on animal or human rights and is amongst the trippiest entries in the world of animation. There is much more to unearth here than what's discernible on screen, for the plot is layered with evocative elements, but not everyone will be appeased by its detached vibe & dull pacing. Frustrating in parts yet thought-provoking in its entirety, Fantastic Planet is worth a shot.",

By using these meditation techniques, Terr is able to learn how the Traag reproduce and of a moon that they call the Fantastic Planet, a place where they are able to finally find peace between the two races.Fantastic Planet could be about that or it could be about whatever you want it to be, such as pets and humans, human rights or just something to trip out to, including the Pink Floyd-referencing soundtrack. It's gorgeous - it took five years to animate - and still a movie I put on from time to time, even if - as I mentioned before - I have never decided what it's all about.",

            "content": "I was just watching a GoodBadFlicks video yesterday where the guy was laughing at US movie studios for buying film rights for some stories and foreign films that they could never ever present in the US for fear of protests. For me it was a strange proposal, why wouldn't they be able to show something raw, uncensored, original? The answer was obvious, but I am not going to dwell on that point.La Planete Sauvage is probably a movie in this category. The film is short, just over an hour, but from the very beginning it starts with something controversial: a woman carrying a baby is being teased by giant humanoids that have fingers the size of the woman. It turns out they are children, playing with the human as a human would play with an ant. They accidentally kill her and her baby is being taken as a pet by one of these giants. They are called Tragg and they consider humans animals, to be petted or exterminated as they please. The very first scenes are brutal to watch and that's why I think this would never sit well with a culture that values superiority more than anything else.You have to watch it in French, if you get the language, I had a dual French/English audio film with English subtitles and, even if I didn't go through the English audio, there is something about the French language that just naturally blends with the arrogant culture of the Traggs. The Tragg culture and their planet were truly spectacular. To think that in 1973 someone thought of a superior technological culture that is truly alien while remaining humanoid, and did it well, was amazing. The concepts hold true even now, in 2014!I have to say that I have been thinking of writing a story about humans treated as pets by an alien culture, but after I've seen this I couldn't possibly do it, as it is perfect as storyline and concepts. It also makes me think of another subject close to my heart: dogs. In Romania there are still a lot of vagabond dogs and the heartless and pointless discussions about exterminating them are very close to what the Tragg are doing when considering the human vermin. There are also some ideas about the \"wild human\" society that hit close to this concept of groups of people gathering around the mentality of the lowest common denominator. So, in my mind, to add valid philosophical and moral points to an already brilliant story with fantastic drawings is like covering the icing of the cake with a ton of cherries!About the animation style. This is something that made some people rate this film a lot lower than it deserves. Are you aware that it was made in 1973, by Czech animators? Actually, besides the voice actors and the wonderful director Ren\u00e9 Laloux, there were almost no French people in the production team. The animation in the Czech Republic is a reason for national pride, but the way they do it was unique and certainly different from the US, French and Japanese animation styles. OK, so maybe you prefer the animation style of Robin Hood, with the animals, but really, this is so much better in so many ways that I couldn't possibly get snagged on animation.Bottom line: The imagination, the way it just threw out there idea after idea, no matter how uncomfortable, the storyline, the amazing creatures, the weird ways in which they were killing people... it was true sci-fi. The real thing! Watch this! It will take an hour of your life, big deal! You will see that your brain will churn all of those ideas for a while after watching the film. It will feel like a strange but amazing flavor on your tongue. Top rating!",

I recall being struck by how beautiful the artwork and the animation was then although being so young, I did not really understand the story.I was lucky to be able to find an old VHS copy. It was a double feature with An Occurrence at Owl Creek Bridge.(Also a beautiful film.) I have re-watched it many times since and I am always struck with how simple, yet complex both the artwork and the story are.On the planet Ygam huge blue Draags keep humans called Oms as pets. An Om mother is teased and chased until dying of exhaustion, her orphaned infant is found by Master Sinh, a key Draag leader and his daughter Tiva and she takes him as her pet.As Tiva grows older, so does her pet that she named Terr. Tiva uses headphones to gain knowledge and that knowledge is transmitted to Terr through a fault in a collar that he wears. He escapes and takes the headphones with him in order to teach other Oms. I will not give away anymore of the storyline as I do not want to spoil it for anyone. In my opinion, it is a movie that needs to be experienced without any spoilers.This film is one of the finest examples of science fiction or speculative fiction if you prefer. Made in 1973, it is a Franco-Czech production and it was directed by Ren\u00e9 Laloux and also written by Laloux and Roland Topor. It really is a classic of both animated and science fiction movies. A must-see for anyone who loves either genre.",

FANTASTIC PLANET was easily the strangest thing I'd ever seen. Now, seeing it again 20-some-odd years later, it's still one of the oddest feature-length films I've ever experienced. Now that I'm a little older, the political metaphors are a lot more transparent to me, but I'm still lost about the incredible surreality of the landscape, the repetitive images, and the dreamlike quality of the sparse dialogue. I guess Rene Laloux is just a really weird guy.Unfortunately, the DVD that I watched has English subtitles on all the time, even when the English-language audio is selected, and the giant discrepancies between the dubbed audio and the subtitles was distracting. Fortunately, though, there's not a whole lot of dialogue in it, which leaves the screen clear for more bizarre and melancholy sights.This film changed my life when I was younger, and it's even more enjoyable as an adult.",

As a social commentary the theme is still relevant, given that the world is controlled by an increasingly smaller number of super-rich people, but the twangy street-style music that you might find in any 1970s blaxploitation film is a failed experiment in contrasts. No music at all would have improved the film, I challenge anyone to prove me wrong. One thing that bothered me is the inordinate amount of time that the aliens spent publicly talking about the humans, when really they amounted to little more than pests like cockroaches or houseflies; time and time again it's demonstrated that the aliens have evolved far beyond humans, so why devote so many resources to talking about them?In the end, the aliens and the humans find a way to work together, which seems like a rather optimistic denouement for a European film. For you reviewers who dropped the m-word on this film, does the word still have any meaning when you encounter a true masterpiece like citizen kane or the mona lisa, or do you have some other superlative tucked away in your brain?",

For any people that are into films of the weird category as well as surest art, your in for a treat because this is one weird ass film; there really isn't nor has there been another animated film or film like this. Like any surrealist art painting it's really hard to describe and explain, it's something you just have to see for yourself to believe. I remember seeing this film for the first time and thinking, \"that was one damn weird movie\" but at the same time I was just amazed, it's also made me want to watch it again just to get details I might have missed first time around.Some might be put off by the stiff movements of the film, but that's because you're not looking at the film right, the film by it's nature is a children's story book but for adults. I like the story which is sort of Dr. Seuss like tale, as it all takes place in some alien planet. Where a giant alien race called the Traggs, hold tyrannical dominance over the human populace called The Oms. Sadly, they've became an endangered species and are now in a race against time for their own survival.It's your simple worm that turned story, sort of a surrealist version of David vs. Goliath it's not a new story but it's really in how it's being told that makes it stand out. And also the film has a good message on how one person no matter how small can make a big difference.Salvador I really also like the music in the film which I think is also beautiful as it fits the film as it has just a lot of odd sound and each of the tunes fits what's going on in the next scene.The animation I think is great, it's slightly feel similar to the art of Henrich Bloch and Salvador Dali, there is just so many strange and beautiful sights in the film enough to eat your eyes whole; and there is so much going on as much as a Where's Waldo Art Illustration, that I don't want to give too much away, as I said this is a film you have to see yourself to get the full benefit.But also, the film in a way reflects the era this film was made the 70's as that era was saturated in lots of psychedelic art and color. But I also just like how otherworldly this planet really is as the film goes on; we learn a new thing all the time about it.The Traggs are very interesting alien beings as their giants with fish like heads. Despite their physical size there a race that mainly is one highly advanced in technology and highly devout to the mind and the mental expansion of it, which makes sense as the 70's was also an era for mental expansion and opening up more.I really like one sequence where there is this group of Traggs that are in some sort of machine which help manifest imagination, dreams and ideas, we just see a series of surest images as the Traggs just change form from one image into the other. The Traggs not all of them are evil, the problem is their viewpoints on other species than their own are bias, nor are they open minded on certain other concepts. So despite strengths they have some areas are weak.We see how dangerous the planet is from the dangers of the wildlife in the world like one blackly funny moment where there was some strange brain tree creature that always captures any weird ear bat creatures that mistake it's arm for a branch.The tree creature then has them in his grasp, shakes them and then throws them down and we see he has a big collection of dead ones on the ground. Down to some of the creative way the Traggs De Om, like a vacuum device that sucks several of them in or even some sort of giant lawnmower like machine that sucks some in and impales them in spikes.But of course, there are moments of beauty, fascinating strangeness, and more black humor. Like another blackly funny moment is seeing the Tragg Tiva playing with the Om Terr by having him run from some radio-controlled storm cloud. Or seeing both Tiva and Terr conduct some sort of orchastraic number by whistling some portion of music from the film and the sound breaks apart a bunch of growing crystals like glass.\"Fantastic Planet\" is a strange, beautiful planet that is truly out of this world.Rating: 4 stars",

I think director Rene Laloux could use A LOT of pointers from Ralph Bakshi , when it comes to GOOD animation. This film is a very intellectual , but the story is so depressing and hard to follow - that after the first 45 minutes , I did'nt want to watch it any longer. I agree with an LA Times critic when he said that this film is \"eerie and imaginative\". But I also say that the animation is UGLY and the story itself is way lame. I understand this film won the um... , won the 1973 Cannes Film Festival Grand Prix Award and this arrises an important question for me...What the heck were those judges ON when it came to dealing with THIS film!? It's totally ugly to look at and the story makes me depressed. If I'm going to watch a French film with English subtitles - I feel it should actually be worth watching! In my opinion - this movie is not worth an award. My rating...not hard to do this - 1/10",

            "content": "This was a movie that I'm not entirely sure how I got turned on to it. I know recently I've been seeing memes that were analyzing the color in some of the shots and another that was comparing something that happens in it to one of my favorite movies of all-time, A Clockwork Orange. When the Gateway Film Center was showing this as part of their Cult 101/Mammoth Monday series, I made it a point to see it there.Having now watched this movie, I can say that this one is wild. We are on an alien planet that is inhabited by Draag. They are blue giants. The children of this race play with human-like creatures called Om. We have one of them, Tiwa, that finds a baby when the mother was killed by other children. The Om baby is taken and named Terr. From here, this child learns along with its owner and then escapes, meeting more like its race. It is then a fight for survival that has some interesting commentary.For this odd piece of cinema, we are getting a French/Czechoslovakian co-production. I reflected on this and it makes sense. We had the French revolution and I read trivia that this movie was delayed due to Russia invading this country. Both countries have a history of oppression which is explored here. The much larger Draags keep the Oms as pets. It is Terr that learns and then escapes with the device that his owner Tiwa uses. What I like here is that he isn't immediately accepted into a race of wild Oms. They shun him at first, aside from the woman who found him. As they are exterminated, they work together and find a way to fight back. The commentary here is that I take humans to be a lot like the Draags. We destroy and enslave things we find to be lesser than us. It takes us facing slaughter to change and conform for survival. The Draags are willing to kill without regard until they're threatened. This is still a relevant concept.What I like though is that this isn't in your face. The beauty of the care into creating this alien planet is though. It is so creative to what they came up with. I like that this movie can just be enjoyed for the visuals. There is a great soundtrack to go with it, which you can also take in. If you want to read deeper into the movie, it is there though. I did see this is based off a novel that now has me intrigued to check out.I can't say this movie is for everyone, but I'm glad I can tick this one off as having seen. I thought it was good, just bordering on being great. It is also fun to see elements taken from this for other movies. One that comes to mind is The Watchmen.My Rating: 8.5 out of 10.",

The animation, for the time, I understand had to be restrained because of lack of resources, but even so the story seems like some kind of hackneyed parable on sexual repression.I'm just curious what went through the director's mind to produce this film in the first place, and why it's given such high praise. Is it because it was a French production that got shoved over to Chekoslovakia before being put back in France due to concerns about the communist takeover? Was it the alleged \"avante garde\" aspect of the artistry in the film, which to me merely a nicety for low budget cartoon. Just what do people absorb, like and find fascinating and fulfilling about this movie?I don't know. But I'll say this, it is a lack luster production that I think only the patients who made the thing in the first place could love. The voice acting is, well, so-so, the animation is static and selectively smooth, the rendering of the planet itself is pretty plain, and the overall story, including the \"climax\" at the end is just too weird to believe. Disney, it ain't.And yet I sat through the thing hoping to find what it is that people love so much about this movie. And I simply didn't see anything redeeming about this film.The basic story involves giant beings taking Earth folks as pets, and how said pets fight for freedom. Then the Earth people learn the \"secret\" of their giant masters, and deal with them in a not so spectacular, in fact down right idiotic final confrontation that looks like it was animated by a bunch of preschoolers. It's that bad.Well thank goodness I checked this thing out at the library and wasn't forced to waste good hard earned money renting a copy.Watch at your own risk. In fact, don't watch it.",

Set on a faraway planet where the humanoids (Ohms) are struggling for freedom under the rule of their more alien-like Draags, the film is related to the cautionary fiction of George Orwell - particularly 1984 and Animal Farm. Based on a novel by Stefan Wul, Laloux and Roland Topor's script is low key and lets the visuals, sounds and eerie mood tell its tale.Topor was also the production designer and it's here where the film truly shines. The look is heavily influenced by European fantasy artwork and the combined Czech-French crew make it truly distinctive. The avant-garde jazzy score by Alain Goraguer gives it a unique flavor.Laloux's later 1987's LIGHT YEARS (aka Gandahar) is also worth seeking out.",

            "review_title": "Trippy but Very Intriguing Sci-fi Venture",
            "content": "In 1973, French animator/filmmaker Rene Laloux released his film adaptation of the book Oms en s\u00e9rie by Stefan Wul. While it did undergo a troublesome production due to the film being coproduced in Czechoslovakia (now the Czech Republic) during the time of Russia invading said country, the final product went on to win the Grand Prix special jury prize at the Cannes Film Festival. Nowadays, the film is regarded as a cult classic by film and animation aficionados alike, and while I don't regard it as a great film, I do admire it nonetheless.The film centers around the planet Ygam where humans, referred to as Oms, are an inferior species to the large blue android like Draags. However, one Om named Terr learns of the Draag's knowledge through a bracelet, and uses it to teach other Oms to rise up against the superior species. With this in mind, the film displays an allegorical message about taking other species for granted, but the story is carried through surrealism. The world of Ygam is harsh and cruel by how the Draag's treat the Oms as animals, some of whom dress them up in prissy attire and use them for fights once they're domesticated. Not to mention, the Draags learn their language through meditation, displaying psychedelic fantasies for all to question. In addition to the bizarre story, the animation is a visual splendor, mainly by how it looks like a series of moving illustrations. Throughout the planet of Ygam exist a variety of exotic creatures and dreamlike scenarios, complete with an avant-garde soundtrack. The character animation is pretty limited, but the unique visual style really helps the film stick out from any other, so it fits well enough in this environment. These surrealistic visuals help emulate the analogies alluding to the film's themes of fascism and war, mainly by showcasing the scary truth of the Draags and how they run their society.That being said, as much as I admire the film's method of visual storytelling, I do think the plot drags on in some points. Roughly half of the film is Terr growing up around his owner Draag named Tiwa, but up until he finally runs away from her, most of the scenes with them could have been edited out to add more momentum. Also, Terr and most of the other characters aren't really that memorable outside of their essential goals to trump the Draags, making them come off as two-dimensional. I know this film is meant to focus more on the allegories of racism and the trippy visuals, but a little more character development would be nice.Nevertheless, Fantastic Planet is a very distinct and worthwhile experience that you only see once in a blue moon. Sure, the characters aren't all that interesting and the plot can get a little slow sometimes, but the way the film tells its story of prejudice through bizarre animation and psychedelic ideologies makes the film quite a unique feature that is worthy of its cult status. If you're looking for an animated feature that embraces surrealism to get its themes across or you're into cult sci-fi films of the 1970s, then this is just the film to check out. Considering that this is one of the few animated features on the Criterion Collection, it's about time we got more of them on said collection to give underrated gems like this the attention they deserve.",

            "review_title": "Sauvage!",
            "content": "The world building of the planet Ygam is absolutely... fantastic! The more the film advances, the more I get to audiovisually explore this unique world, and consequently the more I became surprised every time I encounter an otherworldly technological invention that has been always in my head since my childhood, hoping they'd be realized someday. So, it's clear that watching this proved a fulfilling experience in regards of this aspect.On the other hand, I can't say the same about exploring the premise of the film itself. Being in the animals' place and controlled by even more superior creatures is a concept that also has been in my head (probably because I encountered a lot of stray and abused animals when I was young), but this film didn't expand upon this idea enough to go beyond what I thought about. The only thing that I think redeemed Fantastic Planet in this aspect is that the facial expressions of the human characters (or should I say Oms) are uniquely and effortlessly expressive of how they perceive the treatment of the Draags which, in turn, reflect how we'd feel if we were put in the animals' place. But then again, this also is attributable to the technical competence of the crew, especially the animators. That's what I thought about the film until I realized I was only halfway through.Although it's still a bit of a let down for me, what really saved this from being a huge disappointment is the depth of the subtext. It's not until the second half that the plot begins to unravel. Here we finally find out that the surreal, hallucinatory imagery has in fact a surprising depth. Here the story finally begins to consider the Oms, enslaved, humiliated, helpless and inferior as they are, are human beings after all. Without going to any further detail to avoid spoiling anything, but this film tackles speciesism and social discrimination like no other film did. It's just a shame that it takes too long to establish its world building before getting into its message. As a result, anyone could easily mistake the film for being superficial watching only its overstretched first half, and as a consequence, the second half is too condensed for its own good, given how rich it is.(7.5/10)",

There was never a point while I was watching Fantastic Planet where I felt, \"Yeah, I think I've got the gist of it now.\" Laloux seems to take great pleasure in filling every frame of this film with some new strange creation. The titular Fantastic Planet revealed to the viewer is not some sort of parallel Earth whose only discernible difference from our own world is the presence of some blue fauna. The Fantastic Planet doesn't seem to be a place one could fathom ever existing in the universe. Of course that in no way impedes the story. It only really compliments it. The urgency and curiosity created by such a setting acts as a pretty strong hook to keep you watching. While you're completely invested in the plight of the characters, you will also find yourself constantly wondering what new weird creature might make itself known in the next scene. What higher compliment could there be for a science fiction animation?To speak of the animation. It's wonderful stop motion that I could see turning some people off to this film. Admittedly, I found it totally jarring for the first couple of minutes. I found though that I got used to it after not very long, and it in no way kept me from totally being completely hypnotized. After having completed the film, I can't really imagine it any other way. It isn't smooth and graceful. Some times it can feel more like a subtly shifting painting rather than a traditional cartoon. Really though, it only makes sense for the story. It's not natural. It's off. So is the Fantastic Planet.",

I don't know if the ideas and storyline were original in the 70's but it doesn't seem new or interesting now. It seems to be like a documentary in its narrative, very stilted with no emotional content. The ending was lacklustre, without adding spoilers I'd say it went from chaos to suddenly winning the revolution within a couple of minutes.

            "content": "Though this is a critique of Fantastic Planet (La plan\u00e8te sauvage), it is also an homage to director Rene Laloux. As an indie filmmaker, I am his beneficiary on so many levels. Once upon a time in the mid 70s, there was the Ashland Film Society in Southern Oregon. The curators of the Society screened 16 mm prints of foreign films in community centers and lecture halls. These films were not widely distributed in small town markets at that time. Society members were treated to classics by Kurosawa, Bergman, Fellini, and Cocteau. It is impossible for me to overrate the visual impressions these films imprinted on my mind and emotional body, and the lasting influence they have had in my creative work in theatre and film. One of the classics screened by the society was Fantastic Planet, which I have revisited recently on DVD. It had been 40 year since I originally saw this masterpiece flickering in 16 mm in a dark room, the sound crackling from a single speaker under the portable screen, and yet, as I view it again, I remember vividly its startling animation, presenting its story with originality, intelligence, and sensuality. The script, too, is masterful, investigating the plight of human beings (called Oms) as pets in a world dominated by giants of superior intellect called the Traag, who live artistic and meditative lives on a planet populated by unusually beautiful and dangerous flora and fauna. In this alien world, the Traag procreate by meeting in a meditative state to make love on a nearby moon. Though these super beings have an ultra sensibility of \"civilized\" behavior, their treatment of Oms belies the very foundation of their artistic and technological Utopia, which leads to a violent rebellion led by the reluctant Om, Terr. Much like Shakespeare, its political undertones are as valid today as the day it was released. Not that its tone is Shakespearean. But it does, like Shakespeare, present critical and universal metaphors about absolute power and the abuse thereof, to which it behooves us to take note. Director Laloux has infused the animated medium with a palpable visual poetry with extraordinary simplicity, and that reminds me of how indebted I am for the seeds he sowed, lo, those 40 years ago at my virgin viewing. He has encouraged me in absentia to express my inner most self as fantastically, and poetically, and politically, and simply as I am able. As a postscript, I highly recommend viewing the Laloux interview included as a special feature on DVD.",

The animation, limited as the motion is, is beautiful and eerie, like a Dali painting. Even though the art is oneiric, I appreciated how imaginative it is, depicting beings and landscapes that feel truly alien. The storytelling is slow, with sparse dialog and psychedelic music. A movie like this could easily have been boring and plotless, but instead it never loses sight of the story it is telling. Rating: 8/10",

            "content": "This was one of a set of gift movies my brother had provided to me last year, and I managed to find time today to view it with him. I had no idea what to expect from this film given its home media cover, though one rather annoying thing was that the menu was somewhat wonky. I had to enable subtitles during the film rather than through the menu because of this, though since it wasn't original 1973 theater format, it wasn't anything I should detract from this movie. As for the movie itself?As the name implies, the story's setting is on the fantastic planet (sorry) Ygam, with the Renaissance-style-human depicted Oms and the enormous Draags sharing it. Given how it's a fantasy sci-fi (which in other movies would seem paradoxical), it throws out all these ideas of flora, fauna, and other things to set it apart from reality as much as possible. I don't know about you who might be reading this, but I ended up very confused by this since I thought that some ideas would get a tad more explanation, so they wouldn't be there just for the sake of being there. Anyway, there is one humorous gag earlier on and some drama in the fighting scenes and aftermath. Put simply, the plot is a lot like Night on the Galactic Railroad; there's almost too much going on that you can't wrap your head around it. The animation is also perplexing; it incorporates, as I mentioned, a more fantastic, Renaissance style for the Ohms and scenery and a sci-fi style for the Draags and most of the plot elements. I can understand it being 1973 and thus not being comparable to more recent drawn movies like The Prophet, but the animation is sometimes choppy and not fluid enough when it's important. At the very least, it doesn't recycle animation like what Disney did the same year. It's satisfactory overall, but could have benefited from more movement in other areas unless it was a lower budget movie. If that were the case, I could feel more sympathy for it. Most of the characters are forgettable not because they're too plain and bland, but because they interact with so much that one will be left thinking about anything but the characters. It's generally a movie driven much more by its own plot than by the characters who carry this plot out. Given how I saw it in its original French (though subtitled in English, like I personally prefer), I can't really say much about the acting except that it passes. If you enjoy fantasy or sci-fi, this film is for you. For the common viewer, it's worth a glimpse just in case you're empty-headed or need way too many things to think about. Children, though, may be more bored by this film since it isn't driven by its characters; if my brother actually fell asleep during it (I honestly had to fight the urge twice), I can't imagine how much differently it would play out for younger audiences. Speaking of which, mind the occasional violence and nudity if you are viewing this with young ones. If there's one thing you should be before watching this film, it's completely awake.",

            "content": "I encounter Fantastic Planet from the trailer on YouTube. The whacky and graphic images of human's nature in the strange alien environment are too good to be avoided. Luckily, I have a chance to watch the movie to appreciate it thoughtfully.On an unnamed planet, a blue-ish alien race called Draag is the dominant race with super intelligent technology and civilization. Human (called as Om), much smaller than them, perceived as savages who some of them kept as a pet while the others live in the wild. Terr, a tame Om, flees from his Draag with their learning device that able to insert the knowledge directly. As the de-Om-ization attempt began to terrorize the wild Om community, the Oms start to initiate a revolution.My 72 minutes experience of watching this movie is like having a surreal painting expo. There isn't much of a story since the plot isn't what carries the film, however, the graphic depiction, quirky, haunting, and nihilistic nature of the Oms have an impactful way to tell us what's happening in the movie. Many of the exterior shots feature odd objects/plants/animals with unthinkable nature that only exist to inject more unearthly feelings to the audience. And if we overlook the plot at all, still photos of the movie is enough to tell a story.The highly featured planet's nature makes the narrative can't be taken seriously. The humanity matter, of course, is a unique approach to understand our existence in Earth (environmentally), but most of the story isn't too consistent to show the linearity of the Oms. For example, the learning process and the impact of it aren't depicted, other than they manage to have civilization. Fantastic Planet offers segments and fragments that visually and substantially astonishing, but as a picture, the movie can't be grasped quickly, making the plot and the concept that highly original, can't be appreciated as a whole.The pencil color (?) based animation probably what's making this movie's visual is distinctive than the others, create a sense of reality yet juvenile that manage to capture the cold and vile nature of the movie. And following that, I recommend Fantastic Planet for those who enjoy an experimental film with gorgeous visuals. Not much a story for me, but the visual already justified it.",

So long as the viewer is paying attention to what's going on, grasping the story should be fairly simple. Fantastic planet examines a fantastical story of humanoid beings sharing a planet with larger and far more intelligent large blue giants. The plot focuses on the human's uprising against the superior species and presents a fascinating construct between the two civilizations. Personally, it asked surface level questions like \"Do small insects view us this way?\" While bigger questions arise like \"What kind of statement is this film attempting to make regarding racism, intolerance, and cohabitation with different species?\"Although this is an animated classic from the 70s. Showing this to the kids probably isn't the best idea. Not only does it include disturbing imagery and sexuality, its themes and story is best suited for a mature audience ready for more of an animated experience.

In every scene of the movie, something weird and alien is introduced: bizarre creatures, advanced alien technology, other-worldy landscapes and vegetation. Watching this movie is like taking a trip to another dimension.The film works as an experience, but no so much as a full-fledged movie. Perhaps it should have been a music video instead of a movie. The plot is the most trite, sterile, unoriginal thing in the world. The writing for the character's dialogue and interactions are cold and emotionally stunted. The film makes me think the writer of the film is some cynical, immature, nihilistic, reductionist college sophomore trying to make some ham-handed point about societal relations. The whole premise of the movie, humans being playthings for giant oppressive blue aliens, implies the movie will teach some elevating and inspirational lesson about appreciating other living beings as being more deep, intelligent, and multifaceted than we can perceive on the surface, but ultimately the movie actually seems intent on actually REDUCING humanity and societal relations to mere stereotypical cavemen bludgeoning each other to death over petty ignorance, and simplistic fears and superstitions. Despite that criticism, the film is valuable for its depiction of human beings being treated as mere playthings or animals. The visceral experience of watching it stirs something deep down in a way that can't be put into words.So, to sum it up, this a pretty mediocre film, but worth watching for the unique experience. The movie puts your mind into that creepy \"uncanny valley\" and keeps you there the whole time. I think the movie would have been better off if they just cut the dialogue, set it to some psychedelic music, and let the viewer use their imagination to assume what is going on, because the plot really does not have enough going on.",

The drawings, which are highly artistic and complex, pays tribute to Terry Gilliam, the animator of \"Monty Python,\" though not as humorous, the \"head\" styles of \"Yellow Submarine,\" and even to Bakshi himself, with the anthropomorphisms and occasional nudity.The story, supposedly based on the events of the 1968 Soviet takeover of Czechoslovakia, where the movie was partly animated. It is a story of one human \"Om\" (French for \"man\") named Terr, who loses his mother in the beginning of the movie, is taken care by aliens who become his captors, and then escapes from his alien captor family known as \"Traags\" to a race of humans. With his device of intellectual \"Traag\" knowledge in his head, he passes that knowledge to the other Oms and frees them from the captivity of the merciless \"Traags.\"This movie is not for everyone. It deals with the topic of slavery, although more subtle in this movie than most. This is one of the more slower-paced animated movies, as most foreign cartoons can be as opposed to the Disney movies were used to, despite it's 71 minutes. The Bakshi movies are fast-paced and in-your-face, as adult cartoon movies go. Also, we see many female characters walk around with bare breasts. But if you like animation that is \"different,\" and I actually do, you may appreciate this flick which was a grand prize winner at the Cannes Film Festival and regularly played on USA's \"Night Flight\" program 20 years ago. The \"Night Flight\" program was a late-night cable show that specialized in rock videos and cult films. Check out \"Fantastic Planet\" and see how fantastic this movie was.",

            "content": "I first saw bits and pieces of this on USA Up All Night that aired on Friday nights on the USA cable network back in the 80's and it was such a radical departure from the Disney / Warner Bros / Hanna-Barbera / Max Fleischer animation I had grown up with, I had to know what its title was and who made it. It was weird enough that I knew it wouldn't likely be shown in an after-school cartoon lineup on any of the usual channels either. Rene Laloux's name has since been added to my animation lexicon.\nSeeing it again decades later, the animation is as distinctive as ever though, as other reviewers have pointed out, the actual character development and storyline just by themselves aren't enough to carry the film.\nIt's all about the weird animation and - dare I say it - the soundtrack. From the music with its echoes of Pink Floyd's \"Dark Side of the Moon\" to the exotic plant and animal sounds and sounds of Traag gadgetry, the psychedelic atmosphere created by these stunning aural and visual elements are what keep people coming back to this film after nearly 50 years.",

            "content": "Don't watch this movie expecting some clever allegory, nor speculative sf. It's no masterpiece either - extremely dated music, downright cheesy by today's standards, and the \"adult themes\" are limited to lots of identical-looking bare female breasts (and a glimpse or two of an occasional tiny penis).It seems like the filmmakers started out with grand ambitions, but ran out of money, since the editing & general story has major continuity problems, and the ending stops the story short like a brick wall. The story is extremely simple, and has been told a million times, before and since. The \"allegory\" is limited pretty much to the idea of \"Soviet Union = blue giants, Eastern European nations = tiny humans; can't we all just get along?\". It's also a low- budget animated film, so don't expect even Hannah-Barbara level production values.However, if you're interested in some trippy, hippy spins on weirdo-70s alien lifeforms - sweater barfing tribbles, giant anteater bats, seasons that are marked by crystals growing on your body, etc., then check it out. There are definitely some clever ideas from an art direction standpoint going on here - too bad the filmmakers didn't have the budget or the writers to do it justice.Not entertaining, but of interest to fans of obscure animation.",

Some of that filler time would have been better spent with some exposition, or detailing the backstory of the protagonists and antagonists and setting up the final resolution. But somebody thought the time would be better spent showing long periods of tiny figures running through a Dali-esque landscape and bizarre creatures behaving badly, none of which move the narrative forward. If it's your thing to be charmed by art-school importance this may work for you, but if you want to be told a thoughtful story, look elsewhere.",

Doragu group's appearance seems alien and has the ears looking like fish gills. Om group of the little people look like human. This planet has been dominated by the Doragu group. Om group is often at the mercy of the Doragu group. This film begins from the scene that a mother of Om group holding a baby escapes from a person of Doragu group. Then, the mother cannot live, however, her baby can alive. The baby is picked up by the children of Doragu group. And, he is brought up by her for her pet. This film is very ideological.

            "review_title": "Timeless tale on power and more",
            "content": "I was 12 when I first saw this UFO of a movie in Paris in a beautiful, vast old theatre with a chandelier in the middle of the room back in the early 80s. The blue humanoid alien on the poster had intrigued me and it had good ratings so I went in not having a clue what to expect, but I liked science-fiction in general so in I went on my own. Having recently watched it again, the fascination it exerted on me back then rushed back, only with more insights into the different possible levels of interpretation of the story. What I had only perceived at first as a very conventional tale of struggle between races for independence and power is also the start of more thoughts about other layers of interpretation, some maybe only in my imagination but still interesting to pursue in their own right, which is a lot more than your average Hollywood sci-fi big budget production can provoke.The extermination scenes with the big ball squashing humans like ants were very distressing for me as they echoed other, very ugly and real scenes from WWII I had seen before. The \"can't we all get along\" theme is the obvious first level of interpretation. Beyond this politically-correct view, there are other potential interpretations.The first level : Race. Enslaving inferior sentient beings is wrong and will come back to bite you in the ass when they get an education and organize themselves to fight.The second level : Politics. The superior blue aliens are the masters and humans the slaves. That they are considered in the movie mere pets or vermin is even more odious but serves to stir deep feelings and pure fear in the viewer (\"what if aliens showed up tomorrow and treated us the same way?\" - a few horror movies have used this theme to great effect). This class-struggle allegory is flagrant to me and is typical of the moral indignation that exploitation and injustice spark in anyone who has a conscience. Beyond this, the film shows that the only way out of oppression is education and fighting physically for independence and respect from the so-called 'superiors'. In this the message becomes universal but not very original. From both extremes comes the argument that it is a fight to the death, there can be no middle ground. Elimination of the enemy is the only way back to harmony and peace.The third level : Metaphysical. The supreme entities are blue aliens and, in this view, the humans are on a long quest through ever-deeper knowledge to rise up to be able to see how these creatures find their bliss and harmony (meditation/sex/dancing being the simplistic illustration of this). Of course humans want their share of this and to be their equal. This can be seen as the goal of our existence in this universe : to go to the fantastic planet and leave behind the pain and misery of the human condition. Or just maybe knocking on the door of the creator to get some answers.As one can see there is a lot to appreciate and matter for thought in this eerie, beautiful and graphically original movie. Roland Topor is a weirdo, but an interesting one. The simple animation does not detract from enjoying the story and one must learn to realise that perfection of form is not the most important in conveying a good story even if it does help.I prefer a clumsy but funny Gilliam animation to a perfect but predictable Disney one. Art does not need a reason to exist, sometimes it is just the artist pleasing himself, and we chuckle away with him at his nerve at showing us his bizarre personal visions. We must sometimes stop reasoning only in terms of function and enjoy what makes us human, not just efficient commercial-minded robots (\"the focus group indicates maximum joy at this scene!\" eeech.)This story is based on a french sci-fi novel called \"Oms en s\u00e9rie\" by Stefan Wul. The music is good, typical of it's time and adds to the overall sense of watching something slightly odd from the 1970s. La Plan\u00e8te Sauvage is a work of art that deserves the highest praise and attention not only because it is eerily beautiful but also because it illustrates some of the most fascinating fears and hopes of humanity. Simple it may seem, but there is lot more to think about than the obvious struggle shown.",

            "content": "Fantastic Planet.Where to begin. To assess this film, particularly in the category that it exists of animation it truly has no peer.Based on the book, La Plan\u00e8te Sauvage, Fantastic Planet is an animated film depicting the imaginary, inventive world of the Draags. Mankind is a lower, animal creature and you learn about this universe through the eyes of the orphan protagonist.As with all concept films of the era there is more than meets the eye and an open-mind and desire to understand is a necessary requirement.The art is incredibly Dali-esque with gorgeous attention to detail in almost every frame. The surreal and other worldly visuals accompany the sultry jazz-funk soundtrack to give an unmistakably 70's vibe that befits it perfectly.Given the extent of the information and world contained, pacing wise it feels as if the production rushes to meet its end at a slightly disorienting pace as can be the problem with book adaptations. More character depth would also be a very welcome addition that is also perhaps marred by the lack of time to explore, the book embellishes and ties together much more of this story. However, any film where the criticism is that you'd prefer it if it was longer is rarely if ever a valid fault.Purely for the aesthetic and unique value this film brings I cannot recommend it enough. For those interested in psychedelia, science-fiction or incredible jazz-funk music (preferably all 3) set up an evening and arrange to watch it now.Experience the Fantastic Planet.",
