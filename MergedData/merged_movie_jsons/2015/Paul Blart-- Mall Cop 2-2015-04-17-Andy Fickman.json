            "content": "I don't write reviews very often. I have to feel moved to write one.I liked the first Paul Blart movie. It was goofy innocent fun.IMDb can be a joke as people rate and comment on movies they have not seen. Many of these comments and ratings come even before the movie has even really been released. Many comments out there were bashing the first one and saying there was no reason for a second one. But yes, there was reason for a second one if it is well done.I will keep it light and avoid spoilers. This movie lacked the charm of the first one. Paul Blart was likable in the first one. For this one he was a total buffoon.In addition, the first one made sense as Paul Blart was the only person other than the criminals and hostages in the mall as it was closed. This one takes place in a casino in Las Vegas and everyone knows that they are open 24 hours a day. Why were the police never contacted? Paul Blart was never even hired by the casino as security he was only there for a convention.Also, the fighting scenes with the bad guys last 15 to 20 minutes. Paul actually only fights 2 guys on his own.I really wanted to like this one, but the 3 of us that tried watching it were all bored.There are a couple laugh out loud moments and this movie is suitable for families, but it was awful. Reminded me of the old Dana Carvey movie the Master of Disguise. Just a moronic stupid movie and not likable either. Do yourself a favor and leave your Paul Blart memories with the conclusion of the first movie. This script needed a major overhaul.",

            "content": "Speed 2. Caddyshack 2. Exorcist 2. Star Wars Episode II. These are what are typically named as the worst direct sequels ever.Paul Blart: Mall Cop 2 may be worse than a quadruple feature of all of those. I mean it when I say Paul Blart 2 is one of the most unfunny, moronic, brain cell killing experiences I've had in a cinema. There's an extended sequence where an old man eats a rotten banana that goes on for around 15 seconds. The film begins with Blart's elderly mom getting killed by a milk truck. There's a part where Blart interrupts a stage show and knocks out all the dancers by spinning around on a rope while squealing. There's a part where Blart is attacked by and beats an exotic bird while a piano player nods and smiles (DUDE JUXTAPOSITION LMAO). There's a entire segment dedicated to showcasing multiple Checkov's Guns in the form of a mall cop convention (As if those even existed). I dunno \u0085 I didn't enjoy it.Blart is somehow more unlikable this time around. Rather than a smug dumbass, he's now a smug asshole. The \"film\" is 50% him making fun of people, 30% Blart falling down, 20% plot holes, and 0% funny. I maybe chucked at some points, but truth is I don't even remember the movie or what it was I chucked at. I can say for sure there are more helicopter shots reminding the target audience (Who to be fair also probably need to be reminded to breathe and blink) that the movie is set in Vegas than there were chuckles.You know that rotten banana I mentioned? Paul Blart 2 is that banana, and the man eating is is the decrepit and moronic public eating up the film's schlock yet again, probably paving the way for another opportunity for Adam Sandler and co. to shill even more money out of Hollywood for his posse. Like my painful experience with Transformers 4, people once again applauded upon conclusion, one elderly couple saying \"That was too funny!\"There's tastes in humor and then there's standards in humor. Paul Blart 2 wasn't unfunny to me because it did not pander to my sense of humor. If anything it should have; with all the misogyny and ridiculing of fat people it should have struck my dark humor funny bone. However, there's no gags, there's no punchlines, there's no jokes. There's also no emotional backbone, chemistry, or even real characters to back it up. Characters literally appear and disappear throughout the narrative. I don't even think the villain had a name. I don't think anyone not buds with Blart had one.This time around, not only is Paul Blart a bland copy of Die Hard, but Taken and Ocean's 11. The plot is a cluster-f of nothing. The first 45 minutes are, like I mentioned, just Blart riding around and getting up in everyone's faces for \"comedic\" purposes, with plenty of empty time given for the target audience to laugh hysterically at like a bad sitcom. The actual \"Paul Blart beating baddies\" isn't until the film's finale, and even then he doesn't actually beat anyone, because all of his \"weapons\" are stupidly non-lethal, including a stun gun that only stuns people for 5 seconds, a gun that shoots gum, a gun that spills marbles vertically, and a bean bag cannon. Two characters actually fall asleep in the movie, one of them twice. I felt a kinship to them for that reason.There's a romantic subplot with Blart's daughter and a bellhop that goes literally nowhere and an even more forced \"romantic subplot\" between a hotel manager and Blart. She gets progressively wetter and wetter for him throughout the film, which to me is too far of a stretch of imagination to comprehend and accept. This also leads to nowhere. The female cop on the horse in he trailer? That is literally the ending. Blart himself is beyond unlikable and revolting. He is not reluctant like John McClain from Die Hard, he craves to be the center of attention since his saving on the mall 6 years ago became utterly irrelevant the day after (I wish I could say the same for the movie itself). He's incompetent, rude, crude, and physically unable to actually do anything heroic. He'd make a good anti-hero if he wasn't presented as this humble all American goody two shoes as the movie does.The movie doesn't even take place in a mall. What's up with that? With truly atrocious jokeless dialogue (\"I will bring a folk guitar to a pumpkin fight, because that's how crazy I am!\"), beyond unlikable characters, an incompetent lead, a transparent and personality-less villain, disappearing subplots, stretched imagination, clich\u00e9 and trope filled writing I can say Baul Plart: pop Tart Too is one of the worst films I've ever seen. Offensively stupid and brash, this blatant cashgrab managed one seemingly impossible feat, sink even lower than the previous film. Utterly baffling, this 1.5 hour Wynn commercial (Not a single scene takes place outside of it once they arrive) is to me the Transformers 2 of comedy, a wretched anorexic piece with no soul, craft, or effort put into it at all. The fraction of points I award it are for the laughs my friends and I had at making fun of it and a single shot that lasted a third of a second that looked pretty cool.",

The worst thing about it was the lengthy setup, with plenty of exposition from the previous film followed by a lot of nothing before the actual story takes place. Once that began, I thought it had reasonably funny moments reminiscent of the original. I also appreciated that it had no memorable profanity that would have made it unsuitable for children, like so many \"family\" films these days.

But here one is, and it's pretty much like the first movie, namely that it's a comic take on the formula the action movie \"Die Hard\" gave birth to. While there are a handful of gags that this adult did find to be (mildly) amusing, the humor for the most part is simple-minded and lame, with a number of gags recycled from the first movie. Kids (YOUNG kids) might find the humor to be funny, but I think other adults like myself will sit in silence like I did. Is there anything of merit to be found in the movie? Well, Kevin James does bring in an instant likability, like he did in the first movie. But he really needs someone else to write his material. And the movie looks great, with expert photography and lighting that makes the colors pop out of your television set. So if your kids insist on dragging you to see this movie with them, make sure you get the Blu-ray disc.",

Kevin James of course reprises his deeply loved character once again and I couldn't be happier and honestly he delivers a performance on par with Robert de Niro in the godfather part 2. His character is complex and on many levels a hero. When I was younger I could only dream of having a movie such as this guiding me through my childhood. From the moment I see those segway wheels to the ending scene where Blart embraces death as a part of life and comes to terms with the fact his family died in a tragic fire while he was on duty, I was laughing and crying. This also has one of the best plots of a Kevin James film. *SPOILER ALERT* Paul Blart has all his escapades in what he believes to be las vegas. Unfortunately thats only a reality he created. As aforementioned Blart comes to terms with death etc. To further that This movie is actually a construction of Blarts despair filled mind. He went to vegas originally to drink and gamble his problems away until he fell into the deep depression. The very final scene is possibly one of the most tear-jerking scenes I have ever seen in cinema. Blart awakes and he walks through the graveyard where his family is buried. He breaks down in a flurry of tears before shooting himself in the head, thus joining his family. Truly this is an excellent film, worthy of its ten star rating #Blartforever",

He heads to Vegas with his teenage daughter before she heads off to college. But safety never takes a holiday and when duty calls, Blart answers.Well the first film wasn't the best movie I have ever seen but it was a good family movie and I did have some chuckles. On the other hand Paul Blart Mall Cop 2 was an unbearable watch; the jokes fall flat and they feel really forced. The first movie was a good family film, but to make your family watch this god awful sequel is more like torture.The cast did feel like they had fun making it but I wish I felt the same way about watching this movie. There wasn't anything good about the film at all so take my word for it and save yourself some time.

Heck, I could've written a funnier script than what they came up with.There's only one real redeeming quality to this film, and that's it's physical comedy. Some of the bits were well timed, but most of the time, it's just Paul Blart falling down.The story is a hack plot. Blart's off to Las Vegas, and just happens to get wrapped up in the middle of an art heist. There's not much else that I cared about in the film.1/10...don't go see it.",

            "review_title": "Bigger Doesn't Mean Better",
            "content": "If bigger always guaranteed better, then \"Paul Blart: Mall Cop 2\" would surpass the original. As it is, this long overdue sequel about a buffoonish, hypoglycemic security guard at an obscure New Jersey shopping mall is neither as funny nor as fresh as its haywire predecessor. \"You Again\" director Andy Fickman has replaced \"Paul Blart: Mall Cop\" helmer Steve Carr for this harmless but predictable PG-rated laffer. Aside from either its change of setting or the elimination of two original characters, little has been altered for this lightweight action farce. Anybody who missed the 2009 original should know \"Paul Blart: Mall Cop\" was a parody of the classic Bruce Willis thriller \"Die Hard,\" with a colorful villain whose identity generated the biggest surprise of the film. Nothing about the identity of the criminal mastermind in \"Paul Blart, Mall Cop 2\" is surprising. Indeed, we know who he is from the get-go, and actor Neal McDonough struggles to make this colorless mastermind memorable. Original \"Blart\" scribes Nick Bakay and star Kevin James have complicated the \"Die Hard\" plot with an elaborate \"Ocean's Eleven\" heist. In a nod to \"The Expendables,\" the blundering Blart assembles a motley crew of older security guards armed with non-lethal weapons and pits them against a trigger-happy gang of younger adversaries with lethal weapons. Since you know Blart and company cannot fail, this action farce delivers its best laughs with sight gags that have little to do with its formulaic tomfoolery. The best scene in \"Paul Blart: Mall Cop 2\" has nothing to do with the heist. Our bumbling hero runs afoul of an exotic bird that gives him a royal pecking and sends him packing.\"Paul Blart: Mall Cop 2\" opens with our newlywed security guard discovering that his wife Amy (Jayma Mays) wants a divorce after six days of marriage. No sooner has Blart coped with this tragedy than he contends with another devastating disaster. Blart's mom Margaret (Shirley Knight of \"Grandma's Boy\") sets foot in the street to retrieve the newspaper. Out of nowhere, a milk truck mows down the dear old dame in a crude example of slapstick comedy. Now, the woebegone Blart is despondent because everybody but his teenage daughter has left him. All this occurs during the first quarter hour. Things change for Blart when he receives a letter with an invitation to attend the annual security guard convention in sunny Las Vegas. What our unsuspecting hero doesn't know is that his dutiful daughter, Maya (Raini Rodriguez of \"Babysitters Beware\"), has just qualified to attend UCLA in California. Wisely, Maya declines to let her distraught dad know about UCLA until she thinks he can handle her departure, too. Meanwhile, Maya and Blart check into the luxurious Wynn Las Vegas hotel and casino; the entire film serves as product placement for the casino. While Maya and Blart unpack in their room, an unscrupulous criminal mastermind, Vincent (Neal McDonough of \"Flags of Our Fathers\"), plans the crime of the century. Systematically and secretly, Vincent's gang of high-tech hooligans loot the hotel of art treasures on display and replace them with replicas. Inevitably, it is only a matter of time before Blart and Vincent tangle. This dramatic collision takes place because Maya and Blart quarrel about her extracurricular activities at the hotel. She wants to enjoy the sun and fun of Vegas without her domineering dad hovering over her shoulder. Earlier, when they unloaded their luggage, Blart did his best to discourage any chance of a romance between Maya and an attractive valet, Lane (David Henrie of \"Grown-Ups 2\"), who wanted to help handle their luggage. Anyway, Maya ignores her father and accompanies Lane to a party in the hotel. An anxious Blart tries to contact Maya on her cell phone after she disappears without a word to him. Blart is convinced that Maya has been kidnapped. Reluctantly, Maya tries to return his call, but the party is so noisy that she has to go into another room. Maya walks right in on the nefarious Vincent and his goon squad masquerading as hotel personnel. Predictably, chaos ensues. When Lane follows her, Vincent's hooligans take him hostage, too.\"Paul Blart: Mall Cop 2\" confines virtually all its action to the Wynn Las Vegas hotel and resort. Clearly, the filmmakers had the run of the joint because the cast rarely ventures outside to tour any of the other Sin City sights. Most of the scenes that occur inside the hotel look as if director Andy Fickman recreated them on a sound stage so as not to interfere with Wynn's business. Meantime, James and Bakay learned from the first film not to provide their rotund protagonist a romantic interest like Amy. Reportedly, James and Bakay wrote Amy (Jamya Mays) out of the sequel because Mays had scheduling conflicts between her television series \"Glee\" and \"Paul Blart: Mall Cop 2.\" Sequels that eliminate characters, unless the actors die in real life, sacrifice some of their continuity. Mind you, Mays would have been a welcome addition to the cast. Rather than providing Blart with another drop-dead-gorgeous gal, the writers have him play 'hard-to-get' with a hapless hotel manager, Divina (Daniella Alonso of \"The Collector\"), who reluctantly finds herself attracted to him. This creates comic conflict between Blart and Divina's jealous boyfriend Eduardo, who happens to be the hotel security chief, and Eduardo tries to upstage the presumptuous Blart. Most of the antics that James indulges in other that careening around for laughs on his Segway involve routine, uninspired slapstick. Aside from his flap with an exotic bird, James' second best scene occurs when he fills in at the last minute as the conference keynote speaker. \"If you believe the purpose of life is to help yourself, then your life has no purpose,\" he proclaims to applause. \"Help someone today!\" Altogether, \"Paul Blart: Mall Cop 2\" isn't as hilarious as its witty predecessor, but it is not a total bust.",

This ill-natured movie presents Mr. Blart as a U.S. law \"officer.\" Yet, it depicts him as an insufferable boor and clueless buffoon. Worse yet, he flees the scene of a hit-and-run crash caused by his reckless driving of the segue he has just stolen. He tries to kick and punch an exotic endangered bird to death. Blart cold-cocks an elderly lady doing community service to the floor. His demeaning psychological abuse of his only child seems sure to provoke her suicide, or at least a hefty shrink's bill. I've seen the movies Japan makes for Japanese audiences. They are NOT carefully calibrated to provoke social disorder and disrespect for Japanese authority. If you look at Columbia Pictures' releases since it was gobbled by Sony, nearly every one of them appears to be crafted to promote internal chaos (BLART) or international calamity (THE INTERVIEW) for the U.S. \"Blart!\" is probably a rallying cry for the too-impressionable youngsters cutting fire hoses as \"Blar-Timore\" goes up in flames.

That's how I felt when Paul Blart was lying on the casino floor licking ice cream off of it. Paul Blart: Mall Cop (the first movie) is a harmless comedy that's just a lot of slapstick and goofy humor. In this adventure, Paul Blart and his daughter Maya, now grown up, go to Las Vegas for a convention after his mother gets run over by a bus. Maya tries to get romantically involved with this dude, but Blart, being the overprotective father he is, disapproves. Meanwhile, this bland heterochromic villain attempts to steal Van Gogh's Sunflowers, which for some reason is at the Wynn. Oh, yeah, another thing that sucks about this movie is that it seems like an ad for the Wynn. The signage on the hotels, while present throughout Las Vegas, is seen often throughout this movie. While the Wynn is probably is an extravagant place to stay, we don't need that much product placement in this movie. Plus, if you're spending your money to see this movie, you're probably too young for Vegas anyway. Anyway, the villain's eye color is the most memorable thing about him. What was his name again? So, after that, it's nothing but generic slapstick humor and clich\u00e9 plot points. Way too much of the humor depends on Blart's hypoglycemia, which is not particularly funny, especially after its been done before. There's also a scene where he gets his ass kicked by a goose. There's one where he falls down stairs in a suitcase, and also a lot of jokes involving the use of Blart's Segway. It's just forgettable, generic, and above all, not funny. But what do you really expect? It's a comedy sequel. The list of good comedy sequels is very short, and this certainly isn't on it.",

This time, \"Paul Blart: Mall Cop 2\" ladies and gentlemen. Kevin James once again proves why he is just an unlikable actor. Sure, he has had a few hits and/or decent performances, but when he continues to lead films like this, it only furthers his downward spiral. This time, Pul Blart is invited to a convention in Las Vegas, where he is lead to believe he will be receiving an award. Like every other cliche in the movie, of course a conflict had to happen. Paul Blart becomes the hero taking down bad guys again, and it is as unfunny as it is unnecessary. This film defines why we no longer need sequels to comedies, especially ones that never worked in the first place. There is not much to say about this picture really. It's script is horribly lazy, it's direction is un-inspired, and the comedy is slim to none. There is a forced attempt to make you care about the father daughter relationship, but it keeps going back and forth to the point that I didn't care. In the end, you know exactly what to expect going in, nothing good.",

            "content": "In this sequel of the 2009 action comedy Paul Blart: Mall Cop, Kevin James returns as Paul Blart, a security guard at a New Jersey mall. He and his teenager daughter Maya (Raini Rodriguez), who is heading off to UCLA real soon, are invented to a security officers ' convention at a luxury hotel in Las Vegas. Along the way, Maya falls in love with one of the hotel workers (David Henrie), much to Blart's fear. While attending, Blart discovers a heist by a group of criminal masterminds who take Maya and her crush hostage and decides to take matters into his own hands by facing off each criminal one by one.I am gonna start by saying I really enjoyed the first film. While it was only an average comedy, Kevin James brought out the charm and laughter that many comedy goers could ask for. This film, however, is a total disaster. It was nowhere even remotely funny to the first film. It was filled an cheesy gags, unfunny dialogue, and dumb slapstick violence that fail bring out any sort of laughter. Throughout its runtime, I maybe laughed like once or twice; and they weren't good laughs, just quick little chuckles. The rest of time left me checking my watch multiple times. I was quite disappointed in Kevin James, he wasn't very funny this time around, nor were the other characters. Almost every one-liner they spit out just corny, dumb, or makes absolutely no sense. Like the first film, you have the gag where Paul Blart passing out when he runs low of sugar and gets some sort of sweet to re-energize himself. This part isn't even funny this time around. This movie just takes everything that made the first film funny and just throws it all way. It tries getting out its laughs by having characters act stupid and it just fails miserably. Secondly, since this takes place at hotel in Las Vegas, shouldn't it be called Paul Blart: Hotel Cop?Paul Blart: Mall Cop 2 is a big disaster of a movie, I didn't enjoy one bit of it. If you are looking to find a good time of laughter, you better look elsewhere.",

It takes place 6 years later than the first one-Wow, they even used real time- and Kevin is headed to Las Vegas for a security guard convention. His teen aged daughter, Raini, is tagging along, for support. Daniella is the hotel manager that may or may not have romantic feelings towards Kevin. Neal plays the required baddie that has plans to rob the hotel that Kevin just happens to be staying in. Neal just doesn't know who he is messing with. I guess it depends on whether you liked the first one or not-I did-but if you like goofy, slap stick comedies, this one is just as good as the first one.

            "content": "During one of those Three Stooges life retrospectives that pop up now and again on TV, I remember the narrator (don't remember his name) remarking about Curly Howard: \"Nobody likes him except the public.\" I think this observation applies to actor Kevin James as well. He may never become the darling of uppity, sophisticated, \"cultured\" critics, especially if he continues pursuing \"Lovable Schlump\" roles. But to the hoi polloi (regular folks), James perfectly embodies that endearing eternal underdog everyman determined to succeed no matter how many detractors he has, how many faults he has, and how many obstacles life puts in his way. This explains why his latest movie, \"Paul Blart: Mall Cop 2\" (hereafter \"Blart 2\") is confounding those disdainful critics with an unexpected, initial, 3-week box office take that has already twice recouped its $30 million budget, which by definition makes this movie a hit.In the first \"Paul Blart: Mall Cop\" movie, Blart (Kevin James) rises above his limitations to successfully defend a mall from, and eventually capture, an acrobatic band of thieves. In \"Blart 2\", the sequel, Blart has fashioned a noteworthy 6-year mall cop career (in spite of the headaches he receives from ungrateful customers he helps). Therefore, he feels confident that he will be chosen as the main speaker at a mall cop convention taking place in Las Vegas.However a series of set-backs, both self-inflicted and beyond his control, gradually seems to erode his self-esteem. Checking into a Vegas hotel with his radiant, sensible, and comfortably confident daughter Maya (Raini Rodriguez), Blart makes a self-conscious, clumsy, insecure fool of himself before Divina Martinez, the hotel general manager. He both annoys, and yet fascinates, Divina by boasting about his mall cop abilities and the desire Divina MUST be feeling for him. Blart also embarrasses and frustrates Maya with his obsessive overprotectiveness and suspicion towards her love interest, Lane (David Henrie) \u2013 a product of his fear of loneliness since his divorce six years ago. Worst of all, Blart learns that he was not chosen to be the mall cop convention main speaker. Finally, adding injury and insult to injury, an exotic crane-like bird kicks the crap out of him while he tries to seek solitude and pull himself together.Then dangerous things start to happen. While attending a party with Lance at an abandoned hotel suite, Maya accidentally opens a door to the adjoining suite, which happens to be occupied by fine art thieves led by the well-groomed, ruthless Vincent (Neal McDonough). Vincent holds both Maya and Lane hostage. Maya tries to contact her dad by cellphone, but Paul glumly ignores her calls both because of the main speaker slight and because Maya had earlier told him to leave her alone. But fate also has some good things in store for Paul. The main speaker has become drunk and incapacitated, so Paul is asked to substitute. After a faltering start, he manages to give an inspirational speech about why mall cops are needed. Maya's resourcefulness and scientific ingenuity finally manage to warn her dad about the danger she's in. As a result, Paul slowly gets his act together as he combines his own MacGyver-like scientific smarts, his killer Segway-riding ability, the help of his heroic fellow mall cop attendees Donna Ericone (Loni Love), Nick Manero (Nicholas Turturro), and Saul Gundermutt (Gary Valenture), and his fatherly determination to save his daughter to track down and confront Vincent's international, professional criminals.You could have a field day shredding apart \"Blart 2\"'s improbable storyline, ludicrous coincidences, and juvenile slapstick (e.g. Vincent and his team being found out by a teenager, Blart surviving a horse's kick). However, in my opinion, even at his bullheaded, maladroit worst, and even when you are cracking up at his predicament, Kevin James's Blart keeps you rooting for him, because he is fighting a world that thinks that he's no good to prove, after all, that he has the proper stuff to be a worthwhile father, mall cop, and man. If Blart, the \"underest\" of underdogs, can beat the odds (and without uttering any profanity or resorting to preaching), then the rest of us can overcome our personal shortcomings and triumph.P.S.: In the Sunday, April 12, 2015 edition of Parade magazine, Kevin James's own article \"Underdogs\" explains how his Paul Blart character parallels and reflects his own resolve to overcome his hard-knock life to become a noted standup comedian and TV/movie actor.",

            "content": "Comedy is not a science, but there is a technique that makes it funny. A lot of modern comedies like Knocked Up, This is the End, and The Interview (yes, I know all of these have Seth Rogan) work thanks to developed characters and smart jokes. Classic comedies had these moments as well, but one genre of comedy we rarely see anymore is slapstick. Buster Keaton and Charlie Chaplin were all master of creating large stunts that would evoke laughter for generations to come. Sitting on a train wheel as it's moving in motion? Hilarious! A factory worker that can't keep up with the strenuous machines? My sides are splitting!Somehow, slapstick has become more associated with satire then with regular comedies. But since the genres have seemed to cross, parodies are no longer playing in theaters as many of the last features including Disaster Movie, Stan Helsing and Haunted House have shown to be unfunny. These kinds of slapstick movie fail because they go with the most obvious answers to the joke. Comedy is all about expectation, and if you can see what's coming, then your comedy is going to fall faster then your comic on a banana peal. I guess no one considered this for Paul Blart: Mall Cop 2. Paul Blart (played by Kevin James) is still proud of having saved his New Jersey mall six years ago from the thieves that tried to take it over on Black Friday six years ago (from the first Paul Blart: Mall Cop movie). But the woman he married from the ending of the previous film divorced him after six days and a milk truck hit his mother. Two of the most important people have left him and he's about to lose a third; his teenage daughter Maya (played by Raini Rodriguiz) as she's been accepted into UCLA.For his actions, Blart is invited to a security guards convention where he'll give the keynote speech. He accepts, knowing that he and his daughter need a vacation. They arrive at the Wynn Hotel where Blart meets with four other guards, Saul, Khan, Donna, and Gino, and makes tough chit-chat with the hotel staff. Blart finds out that he won't be making a speech after all, deflating his spirits. Things get worse as a bunch of international thieves are planning on steeling some fine art from the hotel, including a Van Gogh. The thieves kidnap Maya get and it's up to Blart to save the day again.I never cared for the first movie and I really don't care for Paul Blart: Mall Cop 2. The movie was produced by Adam Sandler's Happy Madison company (this movie seemed to be ashamed by this as I did not see their logo in the opening credits), and it reveals why no one should be associated with this production house; high amounts of product placements, emphasis of gross out gags, and worse of all, unfunny material. Perhaps Kevin James can be a funny actor, but he shows little interest here. Paul Blart is unlikable as a character and unamusing as a comedic personality. He spews jokes throughout the movie, yet not one joke made me laugh. NOT ONE! All he has is fat shaming jokes and food jokes. These are the kind of movies that set fat guys ten years behind, only saying that they eat and are lazy. I know plenty of fat people that are productive and find this movie repulsive. Even if a skinny actor had been cast, Paul Blart: Mall Cop 2 still wouldn't have worked as over protective father stories are not funny and even the heist is not interesting. I'll give credit that art is something that people don't steel in Vegas, but still, a missed opportunity.I'll give this one broken Segway out of ten. Paul Blart: Mall Cop 1 and 2 are both so unfunny and lazy, that they belong in the seventy cent DVD bin at Wal Mart rather then a ten dollar cinema. Perhaps for Paul Blart 3, our hero will save people from a holdup at a Dunkin Donuts or something.",

Very fun. It does have a few annoying moments, but they are just moments that pass by quickly before more fun aspects take place. This isn't an amazing movie. It's not an Oscar darling feature.

Its wacky, its stupid, its funny! Its also best for kids. I promise you if you take your kids to see this they will leave happy. But its also great for all ages. Just a film to sit back and watch goofy Blart and his goofy antics. People are calling this the worst movie ever. Many are saying it's this years Jack and Jill. It has a 0% rating on a certain movie website that rhymes with Totten Romatoes, and it's just sickening. I don't go by critics reviews most of the time nowadays mostly because of movies like this that get this treatment. People who gave this movie a scathing review saw the movie to hate it. They walked into the theater already hating it just to hate it. I'm betting many of them didn't even see the movie. If you want a good family film to see with a crowd and have a good time, then ignore the critics and go see this. You wont regret it.

Luckily the second part is better in my opinion. While the story is not far away from each other the location is. This time in Las Vegas instead of a Mall in Jersey the whole Movie is a bit more on Big City level. While this is not the greatest movie Kevin James has done it does entertain and give you plenty of laughs. A little bit of Die Hard mixed with a bit of 96hours and some gags, that is basically what you get here. Straight forward easy predictable action comedy in which as well a part of serious topics like kids growing up and leaving the parents safe home, are shortly put in scene.If you liked Mall Cop and The Grown Ups than you will as well have fun with this movie. If you are a die hard fan of The King of Queens you might walk out the theater a bit disappointed. For me it is not the greatest movie on earth, but it does what it promises, it entertains you and gives you a good time out with quite some laughs.Verdict: We had good fun watching Paul Blart : Mall Cop 2 and think it is a nice lean back and be entertained movie.",

However, being 16, this movie made me CRACK UP, and die of laughter. Right off the bat, it gets you in tears of joy. This movie as mentioned above, isn't like Fast and Furious 7 crying, but a happy tear (RIP PW). PLOT: Paul Blart(Kevin James) returns in Mall Cop 2, yet he is sent to Vegas for a \"Mall Cop Seminar\", and when he is there, he discovers a covert operation, thieving art. This movie doesn't have the \"Taken\" fighting scenes, but more of a kid fighting style. Absolute perfection in the comedy department. AGE: This movie is honestly great for ALL ages, whether you're 64, or 6, this movie will make you laugh. RATING: I give this a 7/10, because well its Mall Cop... not the best plot/content/acting aside from Kevin James & David Henrie, but higher than the avg because it made me laugh, and I enjoyed myself. FINAL RESULT: I would recommend this movie to anyone looking for a fun night out, whether you're on a date, or a family movie night. Great Movie!",

This movie deserves all the credit in the world for exposing this blatant fact once more for the public to see.

The movie is a flop in many ways. The plot is stale and predictable, the characters are bereft of depth, intelligence and nuance. The tired old shticks such as the underdog tale (professional and romantic) don't even come close to being emotionally invested in. Kevin James does nothing to improve any of the above, either.",

Damn you Hollywood for producing movies like this only for money and nothing else just to insult your auditions who went out of they way to pay and see your movie.The whole running joke in the movie is fat Kevin James falling over or getting hurt by many different things around him and my god dose this movie repeat it. That is bad and lazy writing right there when your only joke is that.

            "content": "I really can't believe, that a sequel to 2009 film, Paul Blart: Mall Cop was even made. Directed by Andy Fickman and written by Kevin James and Nick Bakay. This movie doesn't know if it wants to be a comedy or a depressing tragedy piece. The movie brings back, the affable Average Joe lug head, Paul Blart (Kevin James) for one more adventure. This time, he must stop, an art heist from happening, at Wynn Hotel in Las Vegas, where he was staying for a security convention. Without spoiling too much of the movie; I have to say, what a let-down, this film is. I was a huge fan of the first film. While, I know, the first movie was kinda dumb; it was a guilty pleasure of mine, because how likable, the character of Paul Blart, was in the first movie. He's a straight-forward family man who love his daughter, Maya (Raini Rodriguez) & mother, Margret (Shirley Knight). You can't help, feel bad for Paul Blart, in the first movie, as he's just trying to win the heart of the girl of his dreams, Amy Anderson (Jayma Mays). Their relationship might not be realistic, but you buy into it, just to see Paul Blart be happy for once. In this movie, not only does it start with Amy leaving him, but also Paul Blart's mother getting kill in an automobile accident. I don't know, who, though, it was funny to have a nice old lady, getting whack, but it wasn't funny. It was just down-right depressing. \u2013Because of these events, Paul Blart became, unbearable to watch, due to his annoying needy nature. The movie moves in a slow pace and spends way too much time, making him miserable with unfunny gags, and not enough time, establishing the heist plot. Literally, the heist plot, really comes out of nowhere, 3/4 into the film. Unlike, the first movie, that kinda satire, 1988's Die Hard. This movie didn't feel, like anything like that. The movie didn't play out in a closed off surrounding area, like the first movie. It didn't even, bother with keeping with the mall theme. I really didn't get, why the movie was shot in Las Vegas on Steve Wynn's hotel in the first place, when Paul Blart is a mall cop. It doesn't make any sense. I guess, the production crew, wanted a Vegas Vacation. In my opinion, I really didn't think, they put, much work in this film and spent, most of the production time, drinking, being lazy and gambling. I have, never saw a movie so-misused, a Las Vegas theme, before. There were barely anything Las Vegas related in this film. For a movie to be, set in Sin City. There was barely any sin. No, Las Vegas Strip landmarks scenes, barely any gambling, and most of all, no sex appeal. This movie might have work, if they used the sites & sounds, but no, they didn't. Honestly, the movie would have been better, if this movie took place at the Mall of America in Minnesota, like it was supposed to. I hate that this movie change the location, at the last second, because the state of NV eligibility them for a tax credit. It really ticks me off. Also, this film makes the Wynn hotel looks really bad. They allow their employees to host underage drinking party in presidential suites!? Employee will give out information to anybody, about a guest, if they happen to be in love with them!? They lack good security for theater shows. The staff doesn't help you if you're being attack by an animal or pass out on the floor in the lobby. Nor, do they alarmed or evacuate the hotel guests, when gun fire, vandalism or large amount of violence fighting is doing on. WTF!? It was pretty odd to have an action movie, with hotel guests calmly, walking around. There is no realism with this film. The film's mild violence and dumb Keatonesque slapstick humor was alright for the most part, but it became a bit repetitive. While, Paul Blart: Mall Cop 2 is indeed less crude than previous Adam Sandler productions, it did have some profanities, and a couple of gross-out gags. I really didn't like, the gross banana or melting ice cream scenes. At least, it didn't have as much awful fat jokes as the first film. What the movie fails to have is really good smart humor. I have mixed results with the supporting cast acting and how their characters are portray. Some are portray as racial stereotypes, while others are just one-dimensional. One character that I was really glad, they work more, on establishing was Maya. We really see, her blossom as a realistic cool person. It was nice to see, her, have a sub-plot, with her being more independent from her father, by hanging out, with Lane (David Henrie), a hotel busboy. She really made the film, somewhat likable. Unlike the original movie, there are no extras during/after the credits. Overall: This movie is not as entertaining as the first movie. This is one movie, not worth the trip to the mall.",

A word that embodies a person of strength, high moral value, \n extreme fortitude when it's comes to times of adversity, and the \n willingness to put oneself above others. Paul Blart (Kevin James) is \n none of these things.

The film opens in a time of tragedy in Paul's \n life. After his marriage of 6 days ends in an ugly divorce and his mom \n is run over by a murderous milk truck driver, a treacherous void is \n left in Blarts life. it seems as if things couldn't get any worse. \n until one day 2 sealed envelopes enter the Blart family's life that \n would change the course of their destinies forever. To his surprise \n Paul is welcomed to an all expenses paid Security Officers honors \n convention in none other than Sin City. That's right. Las Vegas, baby! \n his daughter is given an acceptance letter to UCLA although she decides \n the timing isn't right to reveal this to her bereaved father in his \n time of grief. With much excitement the Blarts are whisked away to \n Vegas to start their vacation. At the hotel PB and company convene with \n security associates from across the nation who all have heard of Blarts \n exploits but fail to hold him in high regard despite Paul's \n accomplishments. once again we see Paul being underestimated and openly \n mocked for his incompetence by those around him even though he shows \n enormous passion for his work. We are introduced by a spicy Latina love \n interest in the hotels manager who feigns no interest in Paul but \n beneath the surface a small fire burns in her chest for the mysterious \n anomaly that is Paul Blart. Ah, but what is a hero without a villain? \n an eccentric millionaire who frequents the hotel has set up a plot to \n steal various art pieces from the hotel and sell them for profit. It's \n not long before Paul catches on to this horrific ploy due to his \n daughter Maya accidentally seeing some rather unruly dealings of these \n delinquents and being captured. Not only must Paul stop this corrupt \n crook but also save his beloved and only remaining support system. His \n daughter. Paul Blart may seem like an incompetent, overweight, buffoon \n of a security guard, but he has something that is hard to find. Heart \n Determination and Loyalty to those he loves. to me, the story of the \n sequel to mall cop is one of the Underdog. a story that often times \n goes unnoticed and swept under the rug. This film shows us that you \n don't have to the smartest, fastest, strongest or even the bravest to \n be a hero. you just have to have the will and determination to do the \n right thing. With an A+ cast, hilarious dialogue and James' mastery of \n physical comedy i HIGHLY recommend this film to anyone searching for a \n little bit of hope, and a lot of laughs along the way.",

Hell I'm sure there will be a third too, because all the bigwigs like to make trilogies, its great for DVD sales. But yeah...I did like the first movie somewhat, it was a reasonable idea, a mall cop thinking he's a real cop, trying to be a real cop, it worked on some levels.The main pull for this franchise was/is of course Kevin James who uses his weight to gain laughs lets not beat around the bush. Admittedly I am a fan of the guy to a degree (said it before and I'll say it again), I think he's enjoyable, fun and effective with his physical gags, plus he's a good everyman that we the audience can relate too. Unfortunately he does seem to have had more success on TV than the big screen, and he's not helping himself here.This movie is virtually the same sh*t that we saw in the first movie. Blart and his daughter go to a security convention in Vegas, low and behold at the exact same time a group of criminals are planning to steal all the valuable paintings from the same hotel Blart is staying in. Just like the first movie Blart blunders into the crime caper and ends up stopping it in his usual clumsy overweight manner, spoiler alert! he manages it. Oh...would a Las Vegas hotel have the Van Gogh Sunflowers painting in it?Yep its the same as the first movie yet somehow its much worse, probably because its a babyish infantile pile of crap this time around. Seriously, the last movie has some good moments of sarcastic humour, this has nothing, its completely void of anything that would make an adult or child smile. Its bizarre, there literately isn't anything funny at all! not a single moment that made me smile. Hell there aren't any actual jokes! it pretty much consists of James making stupid faces (that aren't funny faces) and mincing around trying to be funny. What I really don't get is the franchises obsession with those Segway things, seriously there is an entire scene dedicated to trying to make out those things are funny. I realise its Blart's little trademark and part of his character but it isn't funny! watching him trying to show off on one isn't funny, its just lame.Everything else is completely predictable throwaway spiel we've seen a shitzillion times before. Blart's daughter is fat just like him, she falls for a good looking guy who is clearly out of her league and Blart doesn't like it, the main baddie looks like a Bond villain, the baddie henchmen are a standard bunch with a token black guy and token sexy females, the hotels security is headed by some uber sexy male hothead and the hotels general manager is a sexy supermodel type. The only thing they add here which had promise and showed some ingenuity, was the little gang of security officers that meet with Blart for the convention. A ragtag team of misfits that really shouldn't be in security...but are, clearly for reasons other than actual security. James older brother Gary Valentine stars in this as one of the aging, fat, balding security guards in this little gang. Again clearly meant to be a hilarious addition...but it isn't.The whole security convention aspect could of been a winner, they did the same silly thing in the US TV version of 'The Office' with an office supply convention. Seeing that episode shows how funny this movie could have been in the right hands, even with James, the material was there (albeit a little bit of good material) but its been wasted. That one small idea does not make up an entire movie of course, and as already explained there is nothing else here of value. Even the apparent suspenseful finale where Blart takes down the bad guys is pathetic and not even up to the meager standards of the first movie! This could have been better with a slight adult edge, it was never gonna be great but it could of been better, but its not, its pretty darn terrible.2/10",

            "content": "Review: I really don't know how this movie made three times the budget because the storyline is ridiculous. The jokes were really bad and the far fetched plot just went from bad to worse. Anyway, it's about a mall cop, Paul Blart, who is feeling pretty depressed after his wife has left him and his mum gets run over by a milk truck, so he heads to Vegas with his daughter to spend some time with her before she heads to college. He's also been invited to an security officer award ceremony in a posh hotel so they pack there bags and they make there way there. His daughter immediately falls for one of the porters so she spends most of her time with him while Paul is preparing his speech and checking out the security in the hotel. He then finds out that another officer is giving the speech but on the day, he is too drunk to say a word so Blart takes over. His daughter mistakenly walks into a heist of people trying to steal some expensive paintings from the hotel and so she calls on her dad to save her life, along with the porter who is also mixed up in the whole mess. Blart then recruits some of the other security officers to help save his daughter but it's Blart who saves the day, as usual. This movie did take me some time to watch because I kept on falling asleep, out of shear boredom. It goes from one crazy scene to the next and the actors, especially Kevin James, just seemed to make complete fools of themselves. The whole painting scam was a shambles and I cant believe that the professional killers got taken out by a bunch of amateurs that didn't have a clue about what they were doing. Anyway, I'm sure that there going to make another Paul Blart movie because of the profit that this one made but I will be staying clear of it. Awful!Round-Up: Kevin James has made quite a hefty sum from making a fool out of himself, $1.2Billion to be exact but his biggest achievement to date is his role in Hitch which made $370million worldwide. At 50 years old, he is a bit of a late bloomer because he didn't start making movies until 2002 were he had a small role in Roberto Benigni's Pinocchio. He then played cameo roles in 50 First Date and Hitch and he added his voice to Monster House, Barnyard and Hotel Transylvania which made $358million worldwide. After starring in a couple of TV series, he finally hit the big screen alongside Adam Sandler in 2007 with I Now Pronounce You Chuck & Larry which made $186million worldwide. Since then, his career has been pretty impressive but were yet to see another side to his acting. He did have a slightly serious side in Here Comes The Boom but he still ended up making a fool out of himself. Anyway, the film was directed by Andy Fickman whose known for his comedy movies like the Game Plan, She's The Man, Race To Witch Mountain, You Again and Parental Guidance with Billy Crystal and Bette Midler. Judging by his previous work, I'm not surprised with the outcome of this movie because he seems to like light hearted fun with silly jokes and not that much depth. Personally, I couldn't stand this movie because I just didn't find it that funny but they will keep on bringing out movies like this because they make so much money.Budget: $30million Worldwide Gross: $107millionI recommend this movie to people who are into their comedies about a mall cop who goes to Las Vegas for a security award ceremony with his daughter and ends up saving her life after she witnesses a heist. 2/10",

            "content": "Kevin James is brilliant as the titular character, Paul Blart, a timid mall cop, who deserves a vacation after his heroic escapade back in '09. James' performance as a middle-aged, overweight security guard is Oscar worthy. Watching this movie was an emotional ride from start to finish. At some hilarious moments, I was rolling on the floor with gut- wrenching laughter. However, at other tear-jerking moments, I was sobbing with sympathy for Blart. Even less sentimental viewers will find themselves struggling to contain tears. One or two boxes of tissues is highly recommended for watching this film. James somehow manages to keep the audience from collapsing with sadness, by including some of the best comedic jokes of the century, such as the fight between Blart and a bird, which will surely be remembered as a classic movie scene, even many years from now. Blart's skills on a motorized Segway are second to none, and the stunts are expertly choreographed. In a similar scene to the original classic, Blart rushes to aid his daughter, but is unable to do so, because of his hypoglycemic condition. During this scene, I was reduced to a quivering mass of tears, as I watched Blart struggle to overcome his condition, but to no avail. All in all, this movie should be awarded 11 stars out of 10 if possible. Kevin James somehow manages to combine both tragedy and comedy into a brilliant action comedy, all while delivering an excellent performance. Though thoroughly entertaining, \"Paul Blart 2\" hides deeper meanings, such as Blart's inner struggle with all of the changes occurring in his life, such as the death of his mother, and his divorce with his beloved wife of 6 days. After watching this movie, I was both in laughter and in tears, and I immediately stayed at the theatre to watch it for a second time. \"Paul Blart 2\" proves that a timeless classic can still be created in 2015.",

            "content": "The original \"Paul Blart: Mall Cop\" was by no means a comedic gem, but it was a genial film with a character that was likable because he helped put a face to those uniformed officers we see exercising authority around our local malls. It took a demographic that is often patronized and laughed at and gave those individuals a heroic quality, whilst still allows its titular character to be a goofball himself. It was a silly little film that almost won my heart. \"Paul Blart: Mall Cop 2,\" however, isn't even entitled to an eighth of my heart. Material that was once passably genial has grown up and become tiresome drivel that attempts to get the laughs out of its viewers by obtaining jokes that constitute as the low-hanging fruit. In just one two minute trailer for the film, I counted Kevin James falling five times, which shows exactly the kind of humor you're in for with this particular film.The story needs little exposition: Paul Blart (Kevin James), who we saw marry at the end of original film, is now divorced after a marriage that lasted only six days and his mother died after being hit by a milk truck, leaving his daughter Maya (Raini Rodriguez) as the closest remaining relative he has. Blart still keeps his mall safe and takes his job very seriously, which he feels is a feat that will be recognized at the upcoming security convention and seminar he'll be attending in Las Vegas. However, when he discovers that the Wynn Hotel, where him and his daughter are staying, is being raided for its art by a group of thugs, Blart must find a way to take down the criminals while employing the integrity he has long possessed to keep his mall safe.The most immediate and, in turn, fatal flaw of the film is Blart himself. A character that was once charming for his goofiness and the way he upheld honor at his job has now turned into a mean-spirited, pompous narcissist who overcompensates the importance of his job. If this kind of attitude was reserved for scenes like Blart addressing a conference of other mall cops, then that would be one thing, but throughout the entire film Blart possesses an uneasy superiority complex that undermines the abilities of his daughter, his peers, and Divina Martinez (Daniella Alonso), the Wynn's general manager who can't stop herself from falling for him. If the original film made us appreciate mall cops a bit more, this one rekindles our worst stereotypes about them.On top of that, \"Paul Blart: Mall Cop 2\" is so drearily repetitive in its gags, and this time, we don't even have a real colorful or lively mall setting to look at. Everything is slicker and more overblown, with Blart finding a whole new inventory of weaponry, physical tricks, and even a new motorized vehicle to employ, all of which does nothing but take a formerly simple concept and extend it past credulous principles. Paradoxically, the fact things are being taken to the next level should mean something significant for the story, but here, it just destroys the simplicity of the original story and cannot find a way to make up for it.Kevin James has never been an unlikable actor, but more of an actor frequently victim to shallow characters. Here, however, watching him be so demeaning to those around him is something that wears on one rather quickly. Then there's the extra elements of the film being a monotonous array of sight gags and other mindless humor that simply degrades whatever meager impact the original film had on us. While \"offensive\" just doesn't seem to be the right word for \"Paul Blart: Mall Cop 2,\" \"unlikable\" certainly paints a more accurate and defining picture.",

            "content": "I LOVE Las Vegas! After multiple trips there, I'll watch any movie or TV show that features that beautiful and fun city. Unfortunately, that doesn't always work out for me. For every \"The Hangover\", there's something like \"The Incredible Burt Wonderstone\". So, when I saw the theatrical trailers for \"Paul Blart: Mall Cop 2\" (PG, 1:34), I said to myself, \"Self? You know something? This one has potential.\" Paging Burt Wonderstone.\"Paul Blart: Mall Cop 2\" is the sequel to the very profitable (read: low budget) \"Paul Blart: Mall Cop\" from 2009. Six years after thwarting a Black Friday heist at his local mall, and in spite of the original movie's tag line (\"Security Never Takes a Holiday\"), we now see Blart (Kevin James) and his daughter, Maya (Raini Rodriguez) on vacation in \"Fabulous Las Vegas\". Well, it's not completely a vacation. There's a security convention in town and Blart is hearing rumors he's going to be asked to be the convention's surprise guest speaker. And he's still the same old Blart \u2013 excessively proud of being a mall cop and insulted when someone doesn't give him his due, or give his job the respect that he feels it deserves.During the back-and-forth over whether Blart is giving that speech, thieves begin stealing the hotel's art \u2013 and kidnaps Blart's daughter and the hotel valet (David Henrie) that she's been talking to. In the inevitable face-to-face showdown between Blart and Vincent (Neal McDonough),the thieves' leader, Vincent has his henchmen and Blart has his fellow security officers, each one more\u0085 unusual than the last. Throughout Blart's attempts to stop the bad guys, he proves as resourceful and physically resilient as he was in the first movie, as do his back-ups. But when the ways they battle for truth, justice and Steve Wynn's art reminded me of the scene in \"Vegas Vacation\" when Cousin Eddie takes Clark to a casino with silly simple, but impossible-to-win table games. But even \"Pick a Number\" or \"Which Hand Is It In\" were more amusing than this film's marble gun or goop sprayer.One subplot in the movie has Blart dealing with his beloved daughter's rapidly approaching departure for college, which will leave Blart even more alone than you'd think based on how the last movie ended. There's a definite family-friendly vibe in the Paul Blart movies. The conflicts lack any real danger (unless you count the many assaults on Blart's person, mostly born of his own clumsiness). There's no real profanity and no sexual content, but also a plot, characters and dialog that are so bland that they make dry toast look like a fancy Vegas buffet. I enjoy family-friendly comedies as much as the next open-minded movie reviewer, but I do expect them to be funny.This movie is earnest and tame, but just not that enjoyable. The script is lazy and settles for bon mots like \"It's a bad day\u0085 to be a bad guy.\" James' delivery of supposedly comedic lines is so over-the-top that they're more likely to produce eye rolls than guffaws. He literally throws himself into the film's physical comedy, but the effect wears thin quickly. There are about four laugh-out-loud sight gags in the movie, but ONLY four \u2013 and they've probably already gotten their laughs out of you if you've seen a TV commercial or theatrical trailer for the movie. James' antics might give some kids a few giggles (very few), but there's not much here for adults to appreciate. Personally, I'd take James' work in his erstwhile TV series \"The King of Queens\" over most of his movie roles, including and especially this one.This was the first film to receive Nevada's newly-enacted film tax credit. That's potentially a good news / bad news scenario. It'll probably mean more Sin City scenery splashed across the big screen\u0085 but that might mean I'll be subjecting myself to more cinematic suffering. Well, better me than you. After all, that's what our Facebook page is here for. So, instead of seeing this particular motion picture, I'd advise reading a nice family-friendly joke book\u0085 or taking a trip to your local mall. It's safe. \"Paul Blart: Mall Cop 2\" is fiction, grade \"D\" fiction.",

He heads to Vegas with his teenage daughter before she heads off to college. But safety never takes a holiday when a gang of people try to steal some paintings. I really enjoyed the first Mall Cop movie and it is one of my favourite comedies of recent years. The first one was directed by Steve Carr and you can really tell the change of director. This movie is set in Las Vegas and I really liked the fact that they changed the setting because it was more conducive to comedy and a much funnier place. Kevin James in the movie is as funny as the first one, I couldn't think of anyone else to play his role and he does it perfectly. He is really funny in the movie and is really dedicated to his role. A thing that the first movie was missing but that this one got right is that the sidekicks where actually funny and added a lot to the story. For instance, the other Mall Cops where as funny as Kevin James and that definitely added a lot to the movie. The first had no real sidekicks and though Kevin James was funny he could have needed the help of others to make it better. I really like this style of comedies and Mall Cop 2 did it very well. A lot of good jokes and memorable moments. My only issue was that the movie takes about 25 minutes to really get going. The first part of the movie is slow but does have a few good gags. But once it gets started it is great! This movie was as good as the first one because of a minor issue but the setting and story was better than the first movie and that's why I highly recommend checking this movie out.

But when a team of criminals tries to rob the hotel he is staying at, he must rise to the occasion and once again save the day! This sequel did see a different and probably more experienced director at the helm! \u0085.but the same writer.-You should know that I am going to try to be fair, but overall it does come down to what I personally thought of the film. Ultimately if you enjoyed it that is fine; I thought it was cute and entertaining, but kinda dumb.-The story's plot develops through convenience and I think it highly unlikely that these villains would rob a high profile hotel while it is hosting a security conference. The subplot and subsequential added drama works fine though. Clich\u00e9, but it is hard to have a super original plot for a movie like this, so I am understanding of that.-The pace was actually pretty good. Yeah.-Kevin James did an over-the-top job as usual, because his character is kinda ridiculous. However I can't think of anyone better for the role, sooo\u0085. The rest of the cast did fine for as goofy or simple as their characters were.-One of my problems with some films like this is that it is very hard to take any of the characters seriously. I know, I know\u0085. Family comedy. Paul Blart's character is just soooooo overdone. And all the other 'team' he assembles is too. Plus they literally had to make the villain have two different eye colors to make him stand out. Although there was one super random exchange they had that had me laughing a good bit.-The music was good but generic. Rupert Gregson-Williams, Harry Gregson-Williams's son I believe, composed, and I hope to hear more from him. There was also one scene set to classical music that had me laughing. A lot.-There are some good laughs in this film, some of which are in the trailer, and most of which are situational humor. However most of the film is Kevin James making a fool of himself, which some people probably find funny. Personal bias, I don't.-Ultimately I thought it was funny, but poorly written and kinda cheesy. Nonetheless, it was not made to be a super great film, or even a believable film. It was made to entertain, and it kinda does. Is it worth paying to see? I don't think so, but I am just usually not into these films. So I will personally land somewhere between not worth the time and Netflix, but if you are looking for a fairly entertaining time with no brainpower required, by all means don't let me stop you! -Paul Blart: Mall Cop 2 holds a PG rating for some peril and one SUPER gross scene I literally had to look away from.

While he is there, a high class criminal is planning to steal priceless art located in the same casino that Paul is staying in. This film is quite terrible\u0085 just about everything it tries to do falls flat. First off, we have Paul Blart himself. He feels like a knockoff of a knockoff of Jacques Clouseau from the Pink Panther series. When Paul needs to be an oaf, he is, and when he needs to be skilled, he is. There is no consistency in his character. There is a scene early on in the film where he can't hit targets about five feet in front of him, while later he can hit moving targets from twenty feet or more away. There is no consistency, so whenever the good guys win or lose; it is because the writers said that they do and not because they actually would have. The overall plot has no flow either. Instead of letting comedy naturally flow into the plot, the entire movie will stop to try and tell a joke every five minutes just for them to fall flat and drag on, consistently. The first five minutes alone managed to make my opinion of the first movie worse. There are numerous subplots, all of which lead nowhere, are completely irrelevant or feel incredibly forced. I can't stress the word 'forced' enough. Why would Blart be invited to this conference if he hasn't done anything in six years? Why would a villain shoot an empty Segway? Why would Blart put on angel wings while being chased? There are no real explanations that would make sense. Instead of creating unique and fresh jokes, standard jokes that we have seen a hundred times in much better movies are shoved into the plot instead. This makes the movie incredibly predictable. I can't give this movie just a single star because I smiled (not laughed) once or twice and there were one or two shots that I liked; however, avoid this movie at all costs.

But how dare they make any film in Hollywood without SAMUEL L.JACKSON .This is 2016 movies that have no SAM have no va BAM ...Mall Cop 2 is directed by Andy Fickman and stars Kevin James, Raini Rodriguez, David Henrie and Neal Mcdonough. Basically, the plot is that after six years of keeping the malls safe, Paul Blart has earned a vacation to Vegas for a conference with other security guards. He heads to Vegas with his teenage daughter before she heads off to college. But safety never takes a holiday when a gang of people try to steal some paintings. I really enjoyed the first Mall Cop movie and it is one of my favourite comedies of recent years. The first one was directed by Steve Carr and you can really tell the change of director. This movie is set in Las Vegas and I really liked the fact that they changed the setting because it was more conducive to comedy and a much funnier place. Kevin James in the movie is as funny as the first one, I couldn't think of anyone else to play his role and he does it perfectly. He is really funny in the movie and is really dedicated to his role. A thing that the first movie was missing but that this one got right is that the sidekicks where actually funny and added a lot to the story. For instance, the other Mall Cops where as funny as Kevin James and that definitely added a lot to the movie. The first had no real sidekicks and though Kevin James was funny he could have needed the help of others to make it better. I really like this style of comedies and Mall Cop 2 did it very well. A lot of good jokes and memorable moments. My only issue was that the movie takes about 25 minutes to really get going. The first part of the movie is slow but does have a few good gags. But once it gets started it is great! This movie was as good as the first one because of a minor issue but the setting and story was better than the first movie and that's why I highly recommend checking this movie out. It is a perfect summer movie that isn't too long and that will make laugh everyone from all ages. Check it out and have a lot of fun!",

Kevin James must have planned a sequel because his material is not enough for just one film so like his line in the film - fool me once, shame on you, fool me twice, shame on me.

            "content": "Many times when I hear a sequel is coming, I cringe in fear at the horrors that studios may churn out. Often many follow ups to a film series pale in comparison to the original, many times being a poor movie overall. Today I hesitantly returned to the theater to see what actor Kevin James had in store for me in the form of Paul Blart: Mall Cop 2. I can't say I had my hopes up high for this movie, but you never know what surprises may be in store. So let's get started shall we?The first adventure of Blart was a cute, wholesome adventure that was good for some stupid laughs and the notion that anyone can get a happy ending. Unfortunately, they couldn't leave it there and thought it would be good to send our aspiring cop back into action to hopefully entertain the crowd. Despite my wishes for fun comedy, Paul Blart 2 fails to deliver the same enjoyment the first one did. Most of the jokes are rehashes, many poking at James' weight and his clumsiness when it comes to chasing down the bad guys. Blart's obsessions with Segways have lost their appeal, his over- exaggerated stunts just looking stupid and more ridiculous with each pull. Crushing people with his weight is also crosses into the stupid zone, especially when he lays on a woman and wiggles on top of them trying to knock them out. I would have to say the worse things though are Blart's rambles about justice, honor, and trying to prove he is a tough guy. His monologues go on and on with much of his dialog being extremely simplistic or drawn out that left me rolling my eyes more so than laughing. I can't lie that I did laugh at a few jokes and antics, mainly the window ramming scene and a few well- timed limericks. As a whole though this movie lost what made the last one fun. Storywise there was not much improvement. Mall Cop 2 starts out quite sad, and again ridiculous, as Blart's world is turned upside down twice in terms of family and love. To escape the depression he heads to Vegas for a convention that will hopefully recognize him for his heroism from the first film, which took six years prior to this movie. Once there the story breaks down to three things: Paul trying to stop the bad guys, Paul learning to let go of his daughter, and Paul trying to find himself. The first aspect is rather pathetic, the bad guys are there to steal art for a client, going through little struggle to acquire their precious cargo. In truth, I found these bad guys more boobs than threats, the main guy lacking any real bite with his bleach blonde hair and different colored eyes. Blart's whole ordeal against them was too easy, and much more diluted than I had hoped to see. The second tale is probably the best part of the movie. Maya (Raini Rodriguez) is about to go to college, leaving her dad alone and without support. Paul must learn the hard lesson of letting go, something I too struggle with, to allow all parties involved to live a better life. While cheesy as it is in this movie, the morale is sweet and helps bring some of the nostalgic charm. The final story of Paul finding himself is not quite as strong. His struggles of accepting himself start out sweet, but quickly fall back to funny as another joke or gag takes place. There are a few exceptions to the rules where Blart makes a motivational speech, or defends the geeks and mocked. Much of this story though has little sustenance and gets hastily wrapped up near the end of this fortunately short movie. As for acting, James seems to have a lot of fun with this role, immersing himself in the Mall Cop with a heart as big as his body. James seems like a guy who loves to make people laugh and smile, and the younger audience members love his antics. His delivery of some of his lines is spot on, using his voice to really emphasize the puns and small wit the dialog has. What really made me laugh were his facial expressions though. Somehow James just has to look a certain way and I will crack up, maybe it is due to his chubby cheeks or maybe I'm just weird. Either way James can still bring out some funny moments. On the sweet side, he still has that cuddly teddy bear attitude that we all fell in love with during King of Queens. He is a lovable lug who is willing to take verbal abuse to do what is right, and he gets points for playing the underdog role I relate to so well. However, there is no award winning performance, outside a Kid's Choice Awards, for this role as it is still the same part he always plays. The other cast do their roles okay, but James is the soul of this movie so I won't go into details on them. Paul Blart 2 is a movie I describe as could have gone directly to TV. The humor has been reduced to something only young and young at heart will like, and the story can't back up the rather bland comedy. I still applaud James for his commitment to roles, but not even the big man can save the drab this film is. You can guess that this movie is not recommended for a theater visit, unless you are looking for something to take your kids too. Wait for it to come on basic cable, and save your money for Avengers 2 in the next few weeks. Paul Blart 2 gets:Action/Comedy: 5.5 Movie Overall: 4.0",

            "content": "Paul Blart: Mall Cop 2 is a sequel to 2009's Paul Blart: Mall Cop. In my opinion the first one was a great film to watch with some friends and family and have a good time with an alright comedy. The second one holds the first one up well.Paul Blart: Mall Cop 2 is littered with fat jokes and fart jokes as slapstick. I'm not so much a fan of fat and fart jokes but I will admit some of them in here did get me. The slapstick is just great. In the beginning something out of the blue happens in his mall with a little boy that got me and everyone else in the theater to belly laugh. Another gem is when Blart and his fellow Mall Cops fight the evil bad guys at the end in an almost Spartan like battle. They charge at each other screaming their heads off and when they defeat a bad guy it is usually by dumb luck. That is probably one of the best moments in the movie. As well as Blart trying to get sugar. The movie does have it flaws. Though out of its many one thing had me during it. The fact that some of the big scenes that I was absolutely supposed to belly laugh were in the trailer! It's something that irks me and not moviegoers as well. You know in the trailer that exotic bird that was attacking him? Yeah well I did not laugh. I new it was coming. I may have had a slight smile but I felt as if I was being forced to.Another one is when Blart is kicked by the horse and flies into a car. Yeah, that was the closing scene. You do not reveal your last scene in the trailer people! You are supposed to make the audience belly laugh at the end so that it creates the illusion it was a hysterical film! Overall Paul Blart: Mall Cop 2 is a decent flick and is a lot better than some followup comedies, ( I'm looking at you Dumb and Dumber 2). It's a good family friendly film with no innuendos (again Dumb and Dumber To) if you enjoyed the first one and would give it a five star or up watch this one while you wait for the big Summer movies to hit. 6/10",

He has lost many of those close to him, and his daughter is about to go off to university. On top of this, during the climax of this film, he is away from his home-turf and up against even tougher foes, a top-level gang of project criminals! The pacing is again excellent. We are introduced to all the key characters and locations towards the start of the film, while not left bored waiting for the action to begin. The themes of security and art present in this film are well-presented in the visual style, just as the theme of a shopping centre was constantly seen in the original. The plot itself is again solid, and refreshingly not simply the same plot as the original. We are also given a large selection of new gags, as well as a few cheeky homages to the original. As ever, Kevin James delivers a strong performance. In conclusion, 10/10. Paul Blart: Mall Cop 2 will have you stood up, chanting BLART BLART SHOPPING CART by the end.

The one that after watching you thought \"i need to have a sequel to this\"? No? well neither did i, and six years on someone answered your request for a film you didn't want. This has to be one of the laziest attempts at a comedy sequel i have ever seen. The structure is extremely unoriginal, just following the exact same formula as the last film from start to finish. And the jokes were unbearably awful, every single one made me sigh and ask \"really?\" It looks like a five year old wrote the jokes in this film to entertain his 4 year old friends, and it just makes this whole film look stupid, as well as Kevin James. Do you remember the days when he was funny? No? well neither do i, he is like a parody of his character from the first film thrown into a similar situation and makes a fool of himself every 5 minutes. Not only was the plot terrible, i had no idea what the actual plot was until almost half way into the movie, yes there are bad guys from the start but i had no idea what they were doing until like 45 minutes into the movie, maybe because it wasn't clear enough or i just didn't care. I must say i smirked like twice in the entire film, one of those times was seeing Kevin James get smashed into the side of a car, and so was the other time. I have to say there was nothing good about this movie, the comedy was atrocious, the plot was pointless and at times non-existent and the bad guys were stereotypical movie bad guys from the moment you see them. It also tries to shove some emotional crap down your throat the entire time and i actually bought some of that for like 5 minutes and then i remembered that i don't care. There were also a crap-load of secondary characters that all factor in through many side plots, most of which were there to fill the hour and 30 minute runtime. So in the end, even Kevin James on a Segway could not save this pile of horse crap, do yourself a favour, and stay far away from this excuse of a comedy. - 1.8/10",

            "content": "6 years, both in the movie and in real life, after his heroic rescue of his mall, Paul Blart heads to Las Vegas to attend a security officers' convention but when a group of art thieves break in, a rehash of the first movie ensues. The first one was a terrible comedy, since it wasn't funny, but it was a good action movie and thanks to that it was perfectly OK, but it didn't need a sequel. Here, Paul Blart just does the same stuff, except not even the action is fun this time. So, what is Paul Blart Mall Cop 2? It's just a fat guy repeatedly suffering misfortune and making a fool out of himself. Is this meant to be funny? Yes he's annoying and yes he's played by Kevin James (Say what you will about Adam Sandler but Kevin James is worse) but he's a human being and to see him just suffer misfortune after misfortune makes the film more depressing than funny. In general, the experience of watching this is more painful than getting shot repeatedly in the face with a paint-ball gun.Boring, unfunny characters, an unexpectedly mean spirited tone, terrible direction, a rock bottom script which is lazy, immature and stupid. In short, this what you'd expect from a Happy Madison Productions movie. It's cringe-worthy. Do the people behind this film really believe this funny? There is a good scene where Paul Blart makes a speech at the conference as a last minute replacement and is really well received by everyone. That's a good moment and genuinely makes you smile. Before long, he's back to being an idiot. A good 5 minutes of the movie involve Kevin James having this fight with a wild bird. Is that meant to make me laugh? All in all, this is just another terrible comedy from Happy Madison Productions, which are still going even though critics and (some) audiences hate all of their movies. It's not as offensively bad as Grown Ups 2 (But then again, what is?) and it's not the worst movie of 2015 (That would be Mortdecai) but it's still a total belly flop on nearly every level.2/10",

            "content": "Think of the worst movie you've ever seen \u2013 a movie that didn't make you laugh, didn't make you cry, didn't move you or change you in any way besides giving you the desperate urge to flee the theater. Think of a movie that was a massive waste of your time and money. Hold that title in your mind. \"Paul Blart: Mall Cop 2\" is worse than that. This may sound like hyperbole or piling on. As of this writing, \"Paul Blart: Mall Cop 2\" is at zero percent on Rotten Tomatoes. (Mind you, Sony didn't screen it for critics before opening day, which is never a show of confidence, so the reviews are still trickling in.) But truly, there is not a single redeeming moment in director Andy Fickman's film. A general flatness and lethargy permeates these reheated proceedings. The jokes never land. The slapstick seems strained. The characters are one-dimensional. And the vague attempts at heart at the end don't feel earned. This is essentially the same movie as the inexplicably successful original \"Paul Blart: Mall Cop,\" which made over $183 million worldwide in 2009. Only this time, Kevin James is even more unlikable as the title character. It seemed impossible when the first film came out that this endearing everyman could play a character that stripped him of all his best on-screen qualities. Back then, Paul Blart was just needy, clueless and annoying, as he smugly patrolled a New Jersey mall on his Segway. In the sequel, he's all of those things but he's also bitter, rude and condescending, which makes him even more repulsive. In theory, though, we're supposed to root for Paul as he takes a much-needed trip to Las Vegas for a security guard convention. In the proud tradition of so many recent Happy Madison productions\u2014\"Just Go With It\" (Hawaii), \"Jack and Jill\" (cruise ship) \"Blended\" (Africa) \u2014\"Paul Blart: Mall Cop 2\" is a vacation disguised as a movie shoot. It's also an extended infomercial for the Wynn Las Vegas hotel and resort. (Steve Wynn himself makes an awkward, wordless cameo at the conclusion.) Paul is in need of a pick-me-up after a string of devastating losses, which are played for crass laughs. First, his love interest from the first film leaves him out of nowhere after just six days of marriage. But worse is the fate that befalls his sweet, dear mother (Shirley Knight), who dies when a milk truck runs over her in front of her house. (This is not a spoiler, folks\u2014it happens in the first few minutes. It's also supposed to be funny for some reason.) All Paul has left is his darling teenage daughter, Maya (Raini Rodriguez), of whom he's more psychotically overprotective than ever. So naturally, she can't tell her dad the good news that she got into UCLA. She has to withhold that information to provide the film with a forced source of tension. Maya also has to come with Paul to Las Vegas, where he's an uninspired clich\u00e9 of the tacky tourist with his loud shirts, tight shorts and cheap ways. But he carries himself with the swagger of a high roller when he gets the wrongheaded notion that he's the convention's keynote speaker. This includes talking down to the hotel's beautiful and polished general manager (Daniella Alonso), which makes her fall in love with him, naturally. Just as baffling is the quasi-romantic connection that occurs between Maya and one of the hotel's valet parking attendants (David Henrie), who seems to have all day to hang around with her, take her for drinks poolside and invite her to a party in a swanky suite. Now I'm just nitpicking. There are much bigger problems here. The central premise of \"Paul Blart: Mall Cop 2\" is that Paul inadvertently thwarts a major heist of Wynn's famous art collection. The mastermind is the cool and crisply dressed Vincent (Neal McDonough, playing a generic bad guy, again), who has infiltrated the hotel's own security staff to pull off the crime. Paul throws himself into the action, literally, which results in a series of lame goofs, pratfalls and sight gags. These include a fight with an angry peacock (whom he totally provokes, by the way) and an overlong appearance in the Cirque Du Soleil show \"Le Reve.\" In the process, he also must save Maya, who somehow managed to discover the scheme within the vast square footage of the Wynn hotel and fell into the villains' hands. For some reason, James likes this character, which must mean that he has zero recognition of his strengths as an actor at this point. He also co-wrote the script again with his longtime writing partner, Nick Bakay. Hopefully, they'll both realize that Paul Blart has collided face- first with every object imaginable by now, and we can all call it a d",

Yes, the movie knew it was stupid, but it was not nearly as good as the original Mall Cop which was barely passable to begin with. Even with Kevin James' slapstick comedy routine, Paul Blart: Mall Cop 2 will surely be a comedy quickly forgotten. The biggest problem I had with this movie is they advertised it as some sort of \"epic\" hotel heist where Paul Blart is the only one who can stop them. In reality, that story lasts for about twenty or thirty minutes. The rest is filled with hit and miss inspirational speeches about how mall cop's are the unsung heroes of the world. Nothing flowed properly in the movie. There was no climax scene in the film whatsoever. It was simply one giant mess. I do think Kevin James is funny, but he only seems to be funny with Adam Sandler. When I thought about it, the only films he has done where people actually laughed are when he shared the screen with Adam Sandler. Kevin James still tried his best, but not even Will Ferrell could have saved this movie from complete disaster. The rest of the acting was nothing special along with practically every other facet of the movie. If you want to see a decent comedy, watch one of Netflix's recommendations because there are no good comedies out right now. I do not recommend you see Paul Blart: Mall Cop 2 in theaters or on DVD.

But be warned Kevin James is no John Candy. As amiable as he was on TV, his transition to leading man in a comedy has failed in many attempts.Sandler now knows this, so aside from casting him as support in his own movies, Sandler has realised that time is running out for James, so makes a quick cash-in on a movie that was unexplainably successful.........and not very good to say the least.As you'd expect, the film doesn't have one funny scene, the script is poor, narrative inconsistent, and the random bonkers characters that grace many a Happy Madison movie are missing.But, and it's a really huge but, (he he) the relationship between James and his daughter saves this from being the poorest sequel ever made, and there is quite a good joke involving a Mall Cop wearing a barbers cape.Otherwise as poor as you'd expect.",

It is well obvious that the main reason as to why this film was given a sequel was due to the success of the original film. Many wonder as to why it took as long as it did (6 years). Had this film came out roughly 2 or 3 years after the original, perhaps this sequel would have generated more input and been more successful. Within the film, Paul Blart: Mall Cop 2 is a relatively simple plot and storyline. This time instead of Paul Blart being a security guard on duty for his local mall, he has been invited to Las Vegas, and plays officer in one of their wonderful hotels, with mainly the running around occurring in their casino. For starters, this film lacks the depth and genuine comedy of the original (although the original was not great or too funny, it had several laughs). This sequel is quite dull and time pasts quite quickly with predictable and reused jokes. The jokes are the same rehash of \"fay guy jokes\" with Kevin James making a fool of himself, seen falling down, hiding behind objects, and a scene where he fights with a large CGI bird. Neal McDonough is the typical villain and he plays his role well, as it is something he has done throughout his career.Overall, this sequel was not needed, though it still made over $107 million worldwide (more than it's budget back) but did not make as much as the original (which was obvious). A positive about the film is the scenery of the hotel and the overall landscape. Certainly just a one time watch, if even at that.",

After seeing this, I come to realise that the sequel was a bad idea. Seems funny, but no impact. In fact a little boring to see the same old comedy tricks again.

Being watchful father and meeting his old friends, the adventure begins, when some criminal activity is going on behind the conference. His plan to save his daughter, as well as thwart the crime are the remaining focus of the film.I felt for a character like Paul Blart, casting Raini Rodriguez as his daughter was a little too much intentional. Yeah, the film was full of television guys every corner. Its not just direction, or performance failed, it was the writing. This kind of comedies is now considered ancient, that's why Rowan Atkinson stopped doing his routine comedies. But now it's certain that there won't be a third. If you had seen the first and not sure about this, believe me, you won't miss anything. Instead, I would suggest you to re-watch the original.

The sequel lacks the memorable action sequences of the first film. The most noteworthy action beat in the movie is when Paul Blart expertly punches an elderly woman in the stomach. The worst part is it was not even a fair fight. If the old lady was aware of the attack i'm sure she would have held her own, especially if she had access to kryptonite. The movie is also disappointing when it comes to the supporting cast. Justin Russo from Wizards of Waverly Place appears in the film and he doesn't even perform any magic to aid Paul Blart on his quest. Overall though, the movie is not that bad. What holds it all together is that it still carries the same inspirational message as the first film. With a killer moustache, a little confidence, and a high-powered segway, you too can take out a building full of armed criminals. #AlwaysBetOnBlart",

Not once did I have that moment as I sat through Paul Blart: Mall Cop. And the theater was the quietest I've ever experienced. For the majority of the film, the audience was stone face silent. It was a painful silence...until a woman giggled at something. Then she buried her face. \"Oh God! Everyone is looking at me,\" she said.Paul Blart goes to Las Vegas for a trade convention. But he can't leave his job behind, so he keeps imagining these scenarios. But in the end, he stumbles upon the dream heist. And all his delusions come true.Okay, at what point did these jerks think that releasing this movie in the world where Trayvon Martin gets shot for walking to the store is okay? From the scenario that they write, Paul Blart doesn't need a pat on the back. He needs help. These lousy filmmakers try to sell this anti-gun message. But they think it's okay to highlight a security officer with an over-active imagination? Really, really bad.",

            "content": "I am not as angry with Paul Blart: Mall Cop 2 as I have reason to be. The movie is too lethargic and bland to earn any sort of rage; the closest I come to anger is that while I was watching the movie I had an intense desire to be anywhere else \u2013 a feeling I haven't had since Gods Not Dead a year ago. My anger for this movie is possibly quelled by the fact that Hot Tub Time Machine 2 is still fresh in my mind, a comedy that contained a joke that brought up mental imagery of The Oklahoma City Bombing. Paul Blart 2 is merely boring and uninteresting.Paul Blart: Mall Cop 2 is a colossal waste of time. It is 94 minutes of watching an otherwise engaging comedian flop around on the floor and make a fool of himself. What it illustrates is that Kevin James is at his best away from Adam Sandler's crew. Sandler's Happy Madison Productions is responsible for this chunk of indifference and also the two Grown Ups movies, and most of the movies that make up James' filmography. They illustrate the low points of his career. Away from HMP, James is a funny likable guy in his stand up and on his TV show and in movies like Hitch.Here Kevin James is a requisite tool, playing a character who is an annoying bongo hunk of flopsweat who is persistently under the mistaken assumption that what he's doing is clever. Paul Blart's signature attribute is that he makes faces and gestures that suggest that he thinks he's being agile and intuitive while in reality he's just a dumpy loser who spends his life embarrassing himself by falling over things and making colossal miscalculations. The problem is that you don't laugh at his antics; you feel sorry for him because of his misfortunes in life and groan impatiently while waiting for him to move to the next obvious slapstick gag.Let's examine one gag in particular. Paul meets a man outside a Vegas hotel who is renting Segways. Since Paul uses this particular item on a regular basis on his job, he fancies himself an expert. He wants to show off but the vendor tells him that he needs to see a valid driver's license first. Paul scoffs. The man is irritated and insists again that he needs a valid driver's license before he can let Paul try it out. Paul goes ahead, doing stunts and showing off while we see the face of the poor vendor who becomes irritated by Paul's stunt show.What is frustrating is that we agree with the vendor. He's a guy doing his job and this idiot is putting his job in jeopardy. The vendor is never set up as an and angry malaprop, but as a normal guy doing what he should be doing. For this, we don't like what Paul is going. That pushes us away from him, and the scene works against the character.There are at least a dozen scenes like this in Paul Blart Mall Cop 2, up to and including a running gag in which he provokes a fight with a peacock. This happens three or four times in this movie, and every time I saw the peacock, I winced because I knew that the movie was recreating a epic fight between Peter and the giant chicken on \"Family Guy.\" It's wastes time, and it isn't funny.The plot finds Blart traveling to Las Vegas after his wife (Jayma Mays) divorces him for no apparent reason after only six days, and then his mother (Shirley Knight) is run over and killed by a milk truck \u2013 that's suppose to be funny, and so are the scenes of Paul Blart crying over it. One the cusp of sending his daughter Maya (Raini Rodriguez) off to college, the two travel to Las Vegas to attend a convention of security guards, and run headlong into a heist of precious works of art.That's it. That's all you need to know. The rest of the movie is watching Paul Blart make a fool of himself. He makes a miscalculation, and usually ends up flying across the room for his troubles. Why? Cause he's fat, and the people who made this movie are under the mistaken assumption that fat people in and of themselves are funny when they fall down.The movie isn't funny. There are no laughs here. Normally I blame the writers and not the actors, but here I have to because Kevin James himself is one of the writers. He wrote himself into a corner. The problem is, you don't laugh at Paul Blart, you feel sorry for him. It's deadly to a comedy, as Roger Ebert once asserted, when you feel sorry for the character. It's painful to watch him embarrass himself, fall on the ground, slide across the floor, nearly get hit by a car or, fighting that peacock, and one endless scene in which he ends up on stage during a performance of Cirque du Soleil's \"La Reve.\" The character isn't funny, he's pathetic. Watching him is a dreary experience.",

Either not aware, or minimizing his daughters attempts at college and acceptance letter dates. Additionally, as an example of film for money I don't know which promoted themselves more, Blart or all the product and resort scene placements in the movie. For most of the film the story went nowhere but heading toward what was a predictable, right from the beginning, ending of redemption by foiling a pretty stupid heist (a heist routine used so often in film it deserves clich\u00e9 status).",

This sequel, however, was just messy and I only laughed (and it barely registered as a laugh) one time.The story doesn't venture far from the essence of the first film (and that's expected) but the story and plot are so lazily thrown together that it actually feels like there's a competition between that and the jokes on which element could be lazier. The film is basically a thrown together story with elements that are either established and altered or established and ignored later or established and poorly developed only so there can be a place for Kevin James to thrown in some equally poorly created comedy. If it wasn't bad enough that all the scenes have a slew of jokes that fall flat constantly, the film overly relies on a single gag and that gag is Kevin James falling down. That was the film's go-to joke and it made for a one and a half hour long comedy so tedious that it felt like it was three hours long.The only part I liked was the character of Maya. Her storyline that involved telling Paul that she was accepted into a good school was interesting and her desire to get out and be an adult and not have her father hovering over her was some great development for the character. Additionally, Raini Rodriguez proves to be the only actor that is actually giving a good performance.

The joke or sight-gag that works seems like nothing more than a lucky spin on a roulette wheel, so infrequent is the occurrence.The follow-up pretty much replicates the plot of the first movie, as the segway-riding Bart bungles his way into foiling an art heist at a Las Vegas hotel/casino, where Blart is attending a security officers convention with his daughter, Maya.Indeed, the sole bright spot is Raini Rodriguez as Blart's carbon- copy but levelheaded daughter, an actress with charm and likability to spare (David Henrie also isn't bad as her youthful love interest).

Considering the fact that this movie has a 4.4/10 average on IMDb, 7% on Rotten Tomatoes, and a thumbs down on Roger Ebert's site, I was quite believably expecting this to be even worse than the first one, which is one of the best examples of Kevin James' un-clever, un-funny acting. Zookeeper was probably his worst performance ever, and I would not be surprised to see its title listed as a synonym of stupid in a thesaurus. Here Comes the Boom is perhaps the best-made movie he has ever been in, just not as entertaining to me as Mall Cop 2. Please don't even get me started on his old sitcom, The King of Queens. I'll just say that I would rather watch Zookeeper twice in one day than a single episode of King of Queens, and I'll leave it at that.So, before I watched Mall Cop 2, I was understandably prepared to despise it, especially considering how much I disliked the first one, and the fact that the majority of people like the first better than it. This movie blew my expectations out of the water. The acting's bad, there are too many Disney channel actors, the plot is contrived, the whole idea is childish, and the characterization is the most pitiful point of the movie, even worse than the first I daresay. But it actually succeeded in it's one goal: trying to be funny. That is Kevin James' biggest failure: trying to make comedies, when he is one of the least funny people I have ever observed. But this movie at least lives up to its genre, and although even the funniest part only gets a silent chuckle out of you, and Paul Blart's insane character is as annoying as it tries to be funny, you can forget about the poorly-made parts, the cheesy dialogue, the bad scripting, and try to enjoy it. That's about the only way to enjoy it.My Official Score: 58.5/100",

            "content": "The Paul Blart movies are the kinds of movies you don't want to admit have any redeeming qualities, but they do. Nobody who sees a movie like this should be expecting a Marx Brothers masterpiece or something on the scale of \"It's a Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World,\" \"Network,\" \"National Lampoon's Animal House,\" or \"The Blues Brothers,\" but the way many critics have been talking about this movie, you'd think they just saw an idiotic Tom Green crap-flick.Six years after his triumphant battle against the Santa's Elves Mall Robbers at West Orange Mall that brought him considerable fame, Paul Blart finds his life has shot back down into the toilet. His new wife, Amy was grossed out by the idea of having sex with him on his honeymoon, and divorced him six days after the wedding. I realize Jayma Mays was too involved with the making of \"Glee,\" but the second movie made her character look like a selfish bitch. The next traumatic event was the death of his mom, who was hit by a milk truck, and the movie does acknowledge the fact that the use of milk trucks are few and far between these days. Nevertheless, there are people who collect them, and I've driven along the New Jersey Turnpike, and saw parts of New Jersey that look like they still use milk trucks. The Oranges are not one of those places.On the positive side, Paul has been invited to a convention of security guards at the Wynn Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas, and Maya has been accepted for a scholarship at UCLA. However due to her father's string of bad luck, she decides to hide her acceptance letter from him. At the hotel, Maya falls head over heels for a valet driver/concierge named Lane, played by David Henrie. His feelings for her are mutual and he doesn't seem to mind the fact that she's short, pudgy and overweight like her father. I would've loved to see their relationship go a lot further. It wouldn't have to be hardcore pornographic, or anything like that. Just something suggestive and titillating. Because after Raini's heartbreaking performance in the Austin & Ally episode \"Beauties & Bullies,\" she deserves some happiness. Maya seems determined to spend her time in Vegas living life to the fullest, like society tells teenagers they should do, while simultaneously throwing massive obstacles that prevent them from doing so.When she stumbles on the sinister plot of Vincent Sofel (Neal McDonough) a high roller who's working on a sophisticated art theft, she tries and fails to avoid being kidnapped, all while Blart is filling in to make a keynote speech about her calling to \"help someone today.\" And when Lane tries to look for her, he gets taken too. Paul finds out what's happening when she finally gets him on the phone, but it's too late, and it's Blart to the rescue once again. And like in the first movie, despite his weight, hypoglycemia, and overall clumsiness, he defeats the henchmen one by one, the majority of which are posing as security guards at the hotel, including some who are genuine.The confinement of these kids could've been used as an opportunity to get them closer together, but instead they use it to try to plot their escape. Though they fail, along the way they find out a little something about the man who kidnapped them that Maya takes full advantage of towards the end. Later on, the same bad guy overhears a conversation between the would be lovers and tries to use it against her dad after he defeated many of his guards and he offers to swap the art for his daughter.One of the crooked guards reminds me a lot of the late Warner Brothers animator Chuck Jones for some reason. The movie also tries to give false hints about two other guards that may be involved in the robbery, when in reality one of them wants to be involved with him, and the other jealously believes he's trying to take her away from him.The movie contains some of the same gags and slapstick humor as the first. Paul inadvertently harms a creature who couldn't fight back (the dog on the street in the first one, and an old lady in the second one), gets in a fight with someone, while another person just watches (the lady in the Victoria Secret's store in the first, and the exotic crane in the second), defeating villainous female sidekicks by squashing them and not doing anything nasty to them, and helps out a little kid (the girl who can't get a shopping bag in the first one, and the lost little boy in the second). Fortunately, it doesn't show a scene where Blart tries to jam out on stage with Mini-KISS, like some trailers have suggested. What it does have is a scene where the other guards help Paul zip-line between Wynn's two casinos. The scene may include trick photography, stunt work, and/or CGI, but it's still scary as hell, even after the first time. I'm not going to lie to you people though. The primary reasons I saw this were for Raini Rodriguez, and my memories of the antics of the first movie, which at this point can't be done without Kevin James. I wouldn't bet on a third movie, but this is good enough for me.",

Kevin James is a known quantity of tacky \"fat man in a little jacket\" (also in quotations) \"comedy\", but his daughter Maya played by Raini Rodriguez is an abomination. She's as terrible and talentless as her little brother via modern family fame. She delivers all of her copy and pasted dialogue with the entuasium of eating a 3 day old ham sandwich. How she got work in Hollywood outside of a seven eleven highlights how terrible this series is to the core.It's amazing there was a sequel or that this is now techniqually a series. It's one joke. Two movies based on one joke that was NEVER even funny. Overweight mall cop on a Segway.they just keep kicking the fur off the dead horse. Again and again it's not funny. I'm worried at this rate, if they make a third film, it will be so oppositely funny, that it may make it funny. Having a credit on this film must be more embarrassing than unemployment.The worst part is, I don't think it's as bad as the first one. Maybe it's that lack of skateboarding super crooks or the fact that the first film is one of the worst movies of all time. But a 2/10 is still twice as good as I rated the first one",

And Honestly, the reviews here are a bit unjust to give it a 1/10 !! oh that's cold :P",

Paul Blart was like that comedian who's trying very hard yet no one is laughing. Much like Stacey Dash's appearance on the Oscar's the other night: cringe worthy.Paul Blart is still an oblivious fake cop with an inflated opinion of security guards. This time he's taking his shenanigans to Las Vegas. There he meets up with other security guards from around the country who are equally out of shape and braggadocios.Kevin James does his typical physical humor accompanied by his exaggerated speech and facial expressions. Just about every joke falls flat and misses the mark. The comedy is the only reason you'd bother to watch the movie because it offers nothing as an action movie or any other type of movie. This is what I get for viewing another Happy Madison production.",

I still like Kevin James's acting, I think he has pretty good comedic timing. The direction is a bit lazy.At times the quality of the jokes and gags are almost like a bad spoof- movie, I generally don't hate spoof-movies, but if they are bad, they can be real bad. And unfortunately this movie is like part comedy, part spoof. (although not spoofing anything in particular)I get why this was bashed by the critics, it is that type of movie, but I didn't find it to be horrible.

            "content": "'PAUL BLART: MALL COP 2': Two and a Half Stars (Out of Five)Sequel to the hit 2009 action comedy flick 'PAUL BLART: MALL COP'. Both films star Kevin James; as a security guard who's far too serious about his job, but still manages to find adventure. In this film he takes on viscous art thieves. James also co-wrote the movie (with Nick Backay) and co-produced it (with his buddy Adam Sandler). It was directed by Andy Fickman and costars Neal McDonough, Daniella Alonso, Raini Rodriguez, David Henrie, D.B. Woodside and Nicholas Turturro. Both films were huge hits at the Box Office, but got horrible reviews from critics. I haven't seen the first movie, but I can definitely say that this sequel isn't good enough to be a big hit, or bad enough to get such dismal reviews; it's just mediocre comedy.The film takes places six years after the events of the first movie; Paul Blart (James) is struggling to get over his wife (Jayma Mays) leaving him, after just six days of marriage, and the sudden death of his mother (Shirley Knight), in a tragic accident involving a milk truck. He finds happiness by continuing to obsess over his mall security job, and spending lots of time with his loving daughter, Maya (Rodriguez). That happiness is threatened, when Maya finds out she was accepted to UCLA, and might have to move to Los Angeles. She doesn't tell her father this news though, in fear that it will break him. Paul is thrilled to find out he's been invited to the security officers' convention, in Las Vegas, and Maya goes with him to the event. Things take a turn for the worse though, when Paul discovers dangerous art thieves are attempting to steal priceless works of art, from the hotel they're staying at, and threatening the safety of his family. The movie is pretty silly but it does have humorous moments. James is decent in the lead, but his script could have used a few more rewrites. It's bad sitcom style comedy, but it's not that bad. I don't regret watching it and I actually found it mildly amusing. I still wouldn't want to see a third one though; or the first one for the first time.Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: https://youtu.be/5zwAFiaOqq4",

The movie is nothing but a rehash of jokes from the first one but with most of the comedy missing. I do have to admit that this wasn't as bad as I expected but it's not good and a sequel that should not have been made. Kevin James is much better than this movie.

Paul Blart: Mall Cop 2's supposed to be fun-filled entertainment for the whole family. In respects, it is, depending on what you're looking for. The plot's very straightforward, the acting incredibly goofy. Its intentions are to be as flippant as possible. Blart's a lovable character, just not overly funny. He's as real a character as you're ever going to get. His short-term wife leaves him, his grand-mother befalls an unfortunate accident... life has taken a downward turn. So off to Vegas he goes with his daughter (Rodriguez). Duty calls when a heist takes place at the casino they're staying at. To some this will be comedy gold, to others a complete waste of time. Mall Cop 2, just like the first, relies too much on Kevin James' clumsiness. It's not as funny the 17th time round.",

Everything about it was just so cringe-worthyNot only was the movie stupid and included very little humor, but the movie also lacked any kind of motivation to make it a decent film. The film was just making fun of Kevin James' weight. To top it off, we had to watch a D-list actress in Raini Rodriguez. Her acting was terrible and the script for everyone was so bad. Her relationship with the worker seemed force and unrealistic making it hard to watch.As I'm in a rush, that's all I have to say.

This subplot is as forced and shoehorned in as a TV episode trying to teach a moral, but the moral is just there for the last 2 minutes of the episode. Paul Blart's \"love interest\" this time is a woman named Divina and she already has a boyfriend, so they portray her as emotionally conflicted? WHAT?! That brings us to the characters. Oh boy, the characters. Let's talk about the character of Paul Blart. In the first movie, I enjoyed him as a sympathetic character who ended up in the right place at the wrong time, and he had to singlehandedly save his mall, and he got the girl, but in this one, he is just stupid, clumsy, lame, and a bit of a jerk to his daughter. He's also a little self-centered. His daughter is the sympathetic character here, as her father is just way too overprotective of her.Now, on to the villains. The character of Vincent is actually one of the only two characters in the movie I actually enjoyed watching in this piece of crap movie. I like his plan about stealing artwork from the hotel he and his goons are staying at and replacing them with priceless fakes. For a comedy, I didn't laugh out loud for any scene except maybe one or two. The only one I truly laughed out loud to is the scene where Paul Blart is on the Segway and he gets hit by the car and then he says, \"Heh, still got it.\" For a comedy movie, that is just a terrible sin to commit to being so unfunny and lame. Oh, one of the most UN-funny scenes to me was a scene in which Paul Blart fights/wrestles with an exotic bird as this pianist keeps playing throughout the whole \"fight.\"OMG, the way Paul Blart actually defeats the villains was incredibly lame. He gets all these quote unquote \"nonlethal security weapons\" such as a beanbag cannon, and a gun that shoots knockout gas, idk, at this \"security cop convention\", yeah, like those exist\u0085 Although to be fair, I did enjoy the design of the segway Paul Blart gets near the end of the movie, but it's only on screen for like, 5 minutes so it's nothing but a wasted device. Such a shame.All in all, I absolutely HATED this movie with a passion. I can't believe I listened to the trailers in believing this movie was good! I do not recommend this movie to ANYONE. This movie, unlike the first one, is not to m=be taken as a guilty pleasure movie, and this movie isn't a \"so bad it's good, it's so bad it's bad\" And also, who was asking for this movie? Again, DO NOT see this movie.",

If any.They basicly ditched the entire cast of the first movie except for 2 charactersAnd the story isn't creative at all. They just go to Vegas for some speech and Paul's daughter gets aceepted to college.Speaking of the college storyline i didn't really like it. Plus I feel like this movie would be exactly the same if they didn't add that plotline inThere's a lot more nit pics I have, but I don't want this video to be too long so we won't get into too muchLet's just say this movie was a pretty big downgrade from the first movieBut I will rate this movie a not so solid 5/10 really the only positive I had with this movie was it was pretty funny if not funnier than the first to me.Overall it was just a very bland and boring sequel I do not recommend this movie at all.

Literally the only thing that changed was the setting, which instead of a mall its a hotel/casino.With that said, it does not totally blow.

The beginning of the film literally ruined the ending of the first film, which I actually didn't think was that bad.SPOILER ALERT! If you're a big fan of the first film, you will NOT like what you are about to read. So if you enjoyed the first film, just pretend that the second film never happened and stop reading. Otherwise, continue reading.The girl that Paul Blart ended up with at the end of the first movie? She ended up divorcing him after a week. Yup! The girl that he worked so hard to win over in the first film, one of the feel-good moments of the first film, is now entirely pointless! But Blart's misery doesn't end there. His mother is also hit and killed by a milk truck.So Paul Blart ends up divorced from the girl he won over after only one week, AND he lost his mother. And keep in mind that this was only about a minute or so into the movie! The moment the milk truck hit his mother, I wanted to get up form my seat and leave the theater. I was that frustrated. But I told myself to stick out the entire movie to the end.And I regret it...it was almost completely unfunny and predictable. You could easily tell who the main villain of the film was the moment you saw him. You could tell that he was going to use the safety weapons at the conference the moment you saw him checking it out. And you knew that his daughter was going to end up caught by the main villain. Plus the guy his daughter was spending time with ended up being an incompetent waste of a character.I also felt that the ending was anticlimactic. Oh, and the Hispanic woman that comes up every now and then that slowly falls for him over time? That plot was also complete waste of time because she didn't end up with him in the end. Instead, he ends up alone after sending his daughter to college at the end of the movie. He hits on a female police officer and gets kicked by her horse to end the film.So to summarize all of that up in a nutshell, Blart ended up miserable, and the film was a predictable and, in my opinion, completely pointless. This movie should NEVER have existed, and I would never recommend it to anyone.",

It's still a relatively good movie to watch and Paul's daughter makes the movie! The story itself is pretty good and fits well with the whole Paul Blart theme.

The writers really perfected Paul Blart's personality in this movie it showed how he was a little bit dumb most of the time but he was confident and I appreciated Kevin James acting choice. As great as the movie was the directors really needed to change a couple of things. I have nothing against overweight people and especially kids and I do know that some guys(or girls) are into overweight spouses but I find that it is an extremely risky and stupid choice for making Lane(a good looking male) falling in love with Maya(an overweight extremely childish looking girl). In my opinion the action/comedy portion of the film started to late and it was a big change from the first movie which in my opinion was a way better film started almost near the beginning. Otherwise, for a family movie I was extremely impressed on how they made me laugh(almost at tears) without any inappropriate language.

            "content": "Paul Blart: Mall Cop 2\n\tPaul Blart: Mall Cop 2 is a cinematic masterpiece. The film begins with Paul Blart reflecting upon a few tragedies that have recently befallen. He remembers how he felt on top of the world. He recalls the amazing view of life when you get to the top. However, the tragedies began to occur. After six days, his wife left him after having some regrets, then his mother got run over by a milk truck, and his daughter was leaving for college next year. Blart was feeling as though he had peaked in life, and it was all downhill from there. However, just when he was close to admitting defeat, he received some incredible news! He opened his mail one day and received a letter that invited him to the Security Officers Trade Association Convention in Las Vegas! Blart is thrilled and believes that he will finally be recognized for his great work at the West Orange Pavilion Mall. Paul Blart arrives and the Wynn Casino and Resort and prepares for a luxury fun-filled event with his daughter. Things begin to look up for Blart when he arrives and thinks that the resort manager is hitting on him. Blart begins to feel very confident that he will be the one to give the keynote speech at the convention later that night. However, his hopes are all crushed when he finds out he will not be giving the speech and that his daughter plans to move away to go to UCLA for college. Things go sideways when Blart stumbles upon a criminal who plans an elaborate scheme to steal art from the hotel. Once again, security is compromised and it is up to Paul Blart to save the day again.\n\tI will award this film 5 stars because it is, as I already said, a cinematic masterpiece. I have awarded this movie 5 stars because it is a film that I watch over and over again and still causes me to have the same emotional reaction every single time. I have probably seen this movie 10 times and I love it more every time. If that doesn't cause a movie to receive a 5-star award, I don't know what will.\nThis film truly has it all. It has action, comedy, love, and a beautiful underlying plot of a father who is reluctant to see his daughter off to college. This film is beautifully done and Kevin James has truly outdone himself. Kevin James is perfect for the role. This movie is amazing because it is absolutely hysterical. There is a scene where Paul Blart's hypoglycemia, a disease that causes him to constantly need sugar in his body, causes him to pass out in the middle of trying to stop the villain. He uses the last bit of energy he has to position himself under a father carrying his sleeping daughter who is holding a dripping ice cream cone. He catches the drips from this ice cream cone in his mouth and is re-energized to go and stop the villain. Another funny part occurs when Paul Blart is sitting in the hotel garden and clearing his mind. In the middle of his relaxation, a crane disturbs his peace. After several attempts to shoo the bird away, the bird violently attacks Blart and a full-scale fight breaks out and Blart eventually defeats the bird. Another amazing moment occurs when Blart is fleeing one of the armed criminals and stumbles through a dressing room and ends up in the middle of a live-action performance stage. Blart perfectly blends in with the ongoing play and the crowd roars in approval. This scene, along with all others, is very well done. Nearly every scene throughout the movie is just as well done and amazing as the ones I just described.",

That's how I felt when Paul Blart was lying on the casino floor licking ice cream off of it.  Paul Blart: Mall Cop (the first movie) is a harmless comedy that's just a lot of slapstick and goofy humor.  In this adventure, Paul Blart and his daughter Maya, now grown up, go to Las Vegas for a convention after his mother gets run over by a bus.  Maya tries to get romantically involved with this dude, but Blart, being the overprotective father he is, disapproves.  Meanwhile, this bland heterochromic villain attempts to steal Van Gogh's Sunflowers, which for some reason is at the Wynn.  Oh, yeah, another thing that sucks about this movie is that it seems like an ad for the Wynn.  The signage on the hotels, while present throughout Las Vegas, is seen often throughout this movie.  While the Wynn is probably is an extravagant place to stay, we don't need that much product placement in this movie.  Plus, if you're spending your money to see this movie, you're probably too young for Vegas anyway.  Anyway, the villain's eye color is the most memorable thing about him.  What was his name again?  So, after that, it's nothing but generic slapstick humor and clich\u00e9 plot points.  Way too much of the humor depends on Blart's hypoglycemia, which is not particularly funny, especially after its been done before.  There's also a scene where he gets his ass kicked by a goose.  There's one where he falls down stairs in a suitcase, and also a lot of jokes involving the use of Blart's Segway.  It's just forgettable, generic, and above all, not funny.  But what do you really expect?  It's a comedy sequel.  The list of good comedy sequels is very short, and this certainly isn't on it.",

I thought a little refresher, somewhat funny too, so on such scenario, anticipating a sequel is common, but this is not what I wanted. After seeing this, I come to realise that the sequel was a bad idea. Seems funny, but no impact. In fact a little boring to see the same old comedy tricks again. Especially mocking a fat man is too offensive at the present era. So the hashtag on body shaming would go viral on social media.\n\nThey did not get a decent story. Even the film characters, including the villains were too old fashioned. Even this film had made in the 90s, might have not received well too. The concept of going vacation-come-convention, we had seen this before, are not we! Yeah, Paul after his short marriage and losing mother, he and his daughter heads to Las Vegas. Being watchful father and meeting his old friends, the adventure begins, when some criminal activity is going on behind the conference. His plan to save his daughter, as well as thwart the crime are the remaining focus of the film.\n\nI felt for a character like Paul Blart, casting Raini Rodriguez as his daughter was a little too much intentional. Yeah, the film was full of television guys every corner. Its not just direction, or performance failed, it was the writing. This kind of comedies is now considered ancient, that's why Rowan Atkinson stopped doing his routine comedies. But now it's certain that there won't be a third. If you had seen the first and not sure about this, believe me, you won't miss anything. Instead, I would suggest you to re-watch the original. That ain't a masterpiece, though a much better one.\n\n3/10",

However, after 12 minutes into the film, I felt that the comedic overtones seemed forced. Watching the scene where Paul is standing at the hotel front desk, and after some light conversating with the conceirge evacuates a draw out vocalization at first thought to possibly be intended as comedy displays itself as the skin of a mid-life human wearing a lacey santa silk nightie somewhat undraped, exposing the spider veins usually shamefully hidden but now showing authenic human beatuy in it's true primal form. The beauty  though, is masked at this point and Paul's expression is ineffectual only to be portrayed as homunculus. The true beauty is not only the film itself, but the observation of self. \n\nComedy. Disesteem. Ing. Extrospection. Introspection. Realization. The essense of life. \n\nOne believes to be fit is to propogate and assist in the development and rearing of progeny. However; in the case the elephant seal of Tierra del Fuego recorded by explorer Samuel L. Cook in the late 19th century; the wails of the Omega males resulted in nulled courtship and thus his geneaogical lieage was forever lost. In this example, it is shown in human society that although, it is not formally expressed - it is a hunger. The hunger to be allowed to thrive, although fruitlessly. Opportunities for feasting, socialization and tertiary enjoyment are not liberties the low-tier animal word can secure. In human society - the modern republic, this being was allowed, and desires to be embraced - for it is the uniwitting soul of salvation. It's dead end is one step towards a smaller profit on palm oil in a remote virginal jungle. This figure looked upon as distateful - blunders incuding the elderly woman in the red and white polka dot gown, the stranger man in the shadowed expanse beneath the casino who looks straight into the essence of the protragonist exposing obvious previous trauma in his unblinking gaze, detached from humanity - there is a sense of reminiscence - of the verdant modern degenerate. He looks upon Paul as not a buffoon, but as the eventuality of the human conditon - a facade of ignorance when the truth, hidden not only within the film itself, but in the audience's visceral interpretation reveals itself as the crowd appears before Blart, unsmiling and cruel. \"Sluggish\" a term describing not only Paul Blart and his confident cajole. It is not merely an artifice, but true confidence as the true hero. He contributes nothing, but consumes less than \"success\". He is the end of the line, which he has an awareness that the other lines can continue but martyred. It is a story of a dark horse. A view of who we believe wins in life, but nobody wins because you are a large mall cop or you are a rich heterochromatic art thief, or an attractive angel-haired vixen. In the end, your progeny's desire for corn oil and the generations to come, soaked in tradition outnumber Paul Blart's total consumption of oil covered food products ten-fold at least. These epiphanies reveal that we are all Paul Blart, everyone loses in the end, the world is dead, get fat, enjoy life, nothing matters, you're okay, they think they're better and they're not.  \n\n\"if you believe the purpose of life is to serve yourself - then you have no purpose\"\n\n- Paul P. Blart",

There is no mall in this film and he only acts like a cop to protect the hotel. \"sigh\".

People should watch the trailer to this movie, the trailer was funny and so it the movie!! My favorite line in the movie is when Paul blurt says what happened to my little George Washington he could never tell a lie. That was funny, or Paul saying let the games begin!! And a lot more!! So I'm all about this when I watch this movie I laugh so much because it's so funny!! It takes place in Las Vegas, people should see the trailer to this movie! And give it a try",

The film picks up with Paul at a difficult time in his life, and he gets invited to a convention in Las Vegas where he has to put his skills to the test again. I'll be honest and admit I never saw the first Paul Blart. Why? It looked terrible. Why did I watch the sequel? That's a great question, and one I'll never truly get the answer to. But what I did get was almost two hours of non-stop fat jokes, none of which were even remotely funny. Kevin James screams and flails his way through the role, and everyone else around him looks incredibly bored, much like any viewer over the age of four. The plot is lame brained and hits all the obvious beats, and that is actually a good metaphor for any Happy Madison film as of late: Lame brained and obvious.

            "content": "Let me at least say this about Paul Blart: Mall Cop... I did like the original. I had only watched it once, but when I saw it a second time before ultimately seeing the sequel, I did find the second half of the first act very boring. But I think there are somethings commendable about the original. Is it as funny as I originally thought? Hell No! But I did see it as a parody to the original Die Hard movie, something I've noticed people not seem to pick up on. And so I will always ultimately like the original as an average movie. However, Paul Blart: Mall Cop 2 is a louder, more obnoxious carbon copy of the original! So, it is stupider and not nearly as subtle with its Die Hard parody as the first one. So, if you didn't like Paul Blart, you're not going to like the sequel. If you liked Paul Blart, you more than likely will find the sequel irrelevant, which is totally is. So, I can see why people feel this is the worst movie of 2015, but personally, I can think of at least seven more from this year that I disliked more!\n\nI think saying it's a louder more obnoxious version of the original is a perfect description of Paul Blart: Mall Cop 2. There is really not much else to say about it other than that. They use the same gags, it's the same plot, and he even falls down the exact same way when he runs into the glass like the first one! I'm not kidding, the same roll and even down to the same exact camera angle, I believe. The plot is even more ridiculous with a mall cop convention, but I guess he needed to get his gadgets from somewhere, right? It even tries to be dramatic by having his daughter about to go to college and him not being able to take her leaving and such, but it's done poorly. \n\nEven Paul Blart is all wrong in this movie! In the original, there was a likability to him. Yes he is delusional in believing he's a serious cop and yes he is crazy, but there was a true underdog story in the original and he did have hopes and dreams. There is some real heart in the original that many don't seem to see. The Paul Blart in the sequel is just more over-the-top in his delusion to the point of being unlikable and very obnoxious to me.  I just couldn't get behind him like I could in Paul Blart: Mall Cop. And the whole subplot of him believing a hot girl is in love with him is completely unnecessary and ludicrous.\n\nThe movie even kicks fans of the original in the balls by having the wife he married at the end dump him within a week! Like she just steals from him and takes off, making it feel like the filmmakers didn't give two shits about the original.\n\nPaul Blart: Mall Cop 2 is absolutely unnecessary and copies heavily off the original to the point of having no creativity whatsoever. It's more over-the-top and stupider than the first. I laughed a few times during the movie and still entertaining enough, but ultimately, the film is not worth it's existence.",

I felt every funny part made me feel unsure on rather if the writers were looking for sophisticated humour or if it was an attempt to really make you chuckle and if it was meant to be sophisticated humour then they managed to achieve that because I didn't really laugh out loud at all but I still laughed a little bit and many people will dismiss this movie as not funny because sophisticated humour is not very popular in movies but it doesn't mean that its bad . it just means it's a different style of humour . but on the other hand as the movie keeps rolling I don't feel like this movie is aiming for sophisticated humour. I feel the writing of this movie is  poorly written and lazy writers . eventually the movie starts to feel boring and every effort that was put in the start of this film to get a chuckle out of the audience goes right out the window. Some of the segments in this film were just completely stupid , not funny at all and I had no idea what the writers were thinking . I had an open mind going into this movie thinking that maybe its not that bad and as a matter fact its not that bad but its still bad .Kevin James is talented but some of the slapstick stuff used in this film is something that Chris Farley could have pulled off. Kevin James is certainly no Chris Farely and the happy Madison Studio needs to learn that . Its very hard to defend this movie but at least you will care about the characters. I feel like a lot families are gonna go to this movie and say it was just okay .",

            "content": "I am not as angry with Paul Blart: Mall Cop 2 as I have reason to be. The movie is too lethargic and bland to earn any sort of rage; the closest I come to anger is that while I was watching the movie I had an intense desire to be anywhere else - a feeling I haven't had since Gods Not Dead a year ago. My anger for this movie is possibly quelled by the fact that Hot Tub Time Machine 2 is still fresh in my mind, a comedy that contained a joke that brought up mental imagery of The Oklahoma City Bombing. Paul Blart 2 is merely boring and uninteresting.\n\nPaul Blart: Mall Cop 2 is a colossal waste of time. It is 94 minutes of watching an otherwise engaging comedian flop around on the floor and make a fool of himself. What it illustrates is that Kevin James is at his best away from Adam Sandler's crew. Sandler's Happy Madison Productions is responsible for this chunk of indifference and also the two Grown Ups movies, and most of the movies that make up James' filmography. They illustrate the low points of his career. Away from HMP, James is a funny likable guy in his stand up and on his TV show and in movies like Hitch.\n\nHere Kevin James is a requisite tool, playing a character who is an annoying bongo hunk of flopsweat who is persistently under the mistaken assumption that what he's doing is clever. Paul Blart's signature attribute is that he makes faces and gestures that suggest that he thinks he's being agile and intuitive while in reality he's just a dumpy loser who spends his life embarrassing himself by falling over things and making colossal miscalculations. The problem is that you don't laugh at his antics; you feel sorry for him because of his misfortunes in life and groan impatiently while waiting for him to move to the next obvious slapstick gag.\n\nLet's examine one gag in particular.  Paul meets a man outside a Vegas hotel who is renting Segways.  Since Paul uses this particular item on a regular basis on his job, he fancies himself an expert.  He wants to show off but the vendor tells him that he needs to see a valid driver's license first.  Paul scoffs.  The man is irritated and insists again that he needs a valid driver's license before he can let Paul try it out.  Paul goes ahead, doing stunts and showing off while we see the face of the poor vendor who becomes irritated by Paul's stunt show.\n\nWhat is frustrating is that we agree with the vendor.  He's a guy doing his job and this idiot is putting his job in jeopardy.  The vendor is never set up as an and angry malaprop, but as a normal guy doing what he should be doing.  For this, we don't like what Paul is going.  That pushes us away from him, and the scene works against the character.\n\nThere are at least a dozen scenes like this in Paul Blart Mall Cop 2, up to and including a running gag in which he provokes a fight with a peacock.  This happens three or four times in this movie, and every time I saw the peacock, I winced because I knew that the movie was recreating a epic fight between Peter and the giant chicken on \"Family Guy.\"  It's wastes time, and it isn't funny.\n\nThe plot finds Blart traveling to Las Vegas after his wife (Jayma Mays) divorces him for no apparent reason after only six days, and then his mother (Shirley Knight) is run over and killed by a milk truck - that's suppose to be funny, and so are the scenes of Paul Blart crying over it. One the cusp of sending his daughter Maya (Raini Rodriguez) off to college, the two travel to Las Vegas to attend a convention of security guards, and run headlong into a heist of precious works of art.\n\nThat's it. That's all you need to know. The rest of the movie is watching Paul Blart make a fool of himself. He makes a miscalculation, and usually ends up flying across the room for his troubles. Why? Cause he's fat, and the people who made this movie are under the mistaken assumption that fat people in and of themselves are funny when they fall down.\n\nThe movie isn't funny.  There are no laughs here.  Normally I blame the writers and not the actors, but here I have to because Kevin James himself is one of the writers.  He wrote himself into a corner.  The problem is, you don't laugh at Paul Blart, you feel sorry for him. It's deadly to a comedy, as Roger Ebert once asserted, when you feel sorry for the character. It's painful to watch him embarrass himself, fall on the ground, slide across the floor, nearly get hit by a car or, fighting that peacock, and one endless scene in which he ends up on stage during a performance of Cirque du Soleil's \"La Reve.\"  The character isn't funny, he's pathetic.  Watching him is a dreary experience.",

            "content": "Review:\nI really don't know how this movie made three times the budget because the storyline is ridiculous. The jokes were really bad and the far fetched plot just went from bad to worse. Anyway, it's about a mall cop, Paul Blart, who is feeling pretty depressed after his wife has left him and his mum gets run over by a milk truck, so he heads to Vegas with his daughter to spend some time with her before she heads to college. He's also been invited to an security officer award ceremony in a posh hotel so they pack there bags and they make there way there. His daughter immediately falls for one of the porters so she spends most of her time with him while Paul is preparing his speech and checking out the security in the hotel. He then finds out that another officer is giving the speech but on the day, he is too drunk to say a word so Blart takes over. His daughter mistakenly walks into a heist of people trying to steal some expensive paintings from the hotel and so she calls on her dad to save her life, along with the porter who is also mixed up in the whole mess. Blart then recruits some of the other security officers to help save his daughter but it's Blart who saves the day, as usual. This movie did take me some time to watch because I kept on falling asleep, out of shear boredom. It goes from one crazy scene to the next and the actors, especially Kevin James, just seemed to make complete fools of themselves. The whole painting scam was a shambles and I cant believe that the professional killers got taken out by a bunch of amateurs that didn't have a clue about what they were doing. Anyway, I'm sure that there going to make another Paul Blart movie because of the profit that this one made but I will be staying clear of it. Awful!\n\nRound-Up:\nKevin James has made quite a hefty sum from making a fool out of himself, $1.2Billion to be exact but his biggest achievement to date is his role in Hitch which made $370million worldwide. At 50 years old, he is a bit of a late bloomer because he didn't start making movies until 2002 were he had a small role in Roberto Benigni's Pinocchio. He then played cameo roles in 50 First Date and Hitch and he added his voice to Monster House, Barnyard and Hotel Transylvania which made $358million worldwide. After starring in a couple of TV series, he finally hit the big screen alongside Adam Sandler in 2007 with I Now Pronounce You Chuck & Larry which made $186million worldwide. Since then, his career has been pretty impressive but were yet to see another side to his acting. He did have a slightly serious side in Here Comes The Boom but he still ended up making a fool out of himself. Anyway, the film was directed by Andy Fickman whose known for his comedy movies like the Game Plan, She's The Man, Race To Witch Mountain, You Again and Parental Guidance with Billy Crystal and Bette Midler. Judging by his previous work, I'm not surprised with the outcome of this movie because he seems to like light hearted fun with silly jokes and not that much depth. Personally, I couldn't stand this movie because I just didn't find it that funny but they will keep on bringing out movies like this because they make so much money.\n\nBudget: $30million\nWorldwide Gross: $107million\n\nI recommend this movie to people who are into their comedies about a mall cop who goes to Las Vegas for a security award ceremony with his daughter and ends up saving her life after she witnesses a heist. 2/10",

Cultures form, certain unwritten rules emerge and the community unites over common likes, but also, more indelibly over common enemies. Nothing unites people more than finding a scapegoat that you can all agree to hate, and the natural peer pressure within groups will always perpetuate this pattern. Well, I suspect the community of critics are the same, and unfortunately any movie associated with Adam Sandler or M.Night Shyamalan is automatically slated. They're the scapegoats in this community, and unfairly so in my opinion. I love these Happy Madison types of movies. Yes they're a bit crap, but they're supposed to be. They're fun. They're like B-Movies and they always have a great spirit and message to them; that we shouldn't take life so seriously and that it's ok to be different. \nAnd while I'm on the topic, animated movies, foreign movies and documentaries are always rated excessively high. These seem to be the movies that it's \"cool\" for critics to like. Moral of the story, take ratings with a pinch of salt. Make up your own mind.",

I didn't laugh once, not even a chuckle and I like Kevin James. He isn't the issue of the movie, it is the lazy writing that gets full blame. Did anyone really care to see this character outside of his workplace? That's another huge issue with the movie, why do we care about anything going on? You may think a 1 1/2 star might be to generous but I kind of liked the moments with David Henre and Raini Rodriguez but overall, avoid this at all cost.",

Sure, he has had a few hits and/or decent performances, but when he continues to lead films like this, it only furthers his downward spiral. This time, Pul Blart is invited to a convention in Las Vegas, where he is lead to believe he will be receiving an award. Like every other cliche in the movie, of course a conflict had to happen. Paul Blart becomes the hero taking down bad guys again, and it is as unfunny as it is unnecessary. This film defines why we no longer need sequels to comedies, especially ones that never worked in the first place. There is not much to say about this picture really. It's script is horribly lazy, it's direction is un-inspired, and the comedy is slim to none.

He heads to Vegas with his teenage daughter before she heads off to college. But safety never takes a holiday and when duty calls, Blart answers. \n\nWell the first film wasn't the best movie I have ever seen but it was a good family movie and I did have some chuckles. On the other hand Paul Blart Mall Cop 2 was an unbearable watch; the jokes fall flat and they feel really forced. The first movie was a good family film, but to make your family watch this god awful sequel is more like torture. \n\n\nThe cast did feel like they had fun making it but I wish I felt the same way about watching this movie. There wasn't anything good about the film at all so take my word for it and save yourself some time. Cheers and remember I watch the crappy movies so you don't have to. \n\n1 out of 10 \n\nedited by Samantha Locke\n\nFacebook page: https://www.facebook.com/FatMikesMovieReviews\ntwitter: @FatMikeTPK",

            "content": "You can't stop Kevin James from making movies.  Because the masses were clamoring for a sequel six years after the fact, everybody's favorite mall cop is back, and he's headed to Vegas.  Of course given that this is a Paul Blart movie, he's immediately going to find himself in some sort of caper he's going to unintentionally thwart.  I'm going to start by paying this film a mighty big compliment: this isn't nearly as bad as I thought this was going to be.  I watched a trailer, and I shivered with how terrible this looked.  I mean it's not like the first movie was anything to write home about, why on Earth did they decide to move forward on Paul Blart 2?  While I may not be able to answer that question per se, I do want to go ahead and issue a bit of a disclaimer: this review is likely going to come off as sounding more positive than negative, but that is only because I sat down with the expectation that I would be gouging my eyes out before the end credits.  Make no mistake, this is a bad movie, and unless you have a thing for Segway jokes, you can skip this, carry on with your life and go to the grave with a Paul Blart free existence.  So let's get to why this isn't the worst film in the world, and there will be minor spoilers here (I figure that if there's a movie I can get away with spoilers on, it's Paul Blart).  For one thing, I watched this stony faced and arms crossed, and this actually started with a big laugh that cold-clocked me.  If you remember from the first movie, it ends with Blart getting the hot chick and saving the day.  This opens with him getting divorced 6 days after his marriage.  It's just something that I wasn't expecting, and it actually started this off on the right foot for me.  It took me a while, but I did eventually have to admit to myself that this movie was making me laugh to myself, in a shaking-my-head kind of way.  The amount of padding that is here is actually kind of hilarious from a filmmaking standpoint.  For example, there is a scene where Blart just looks at the camera, says he needs some fresh air, and then walks outside to fight an African crane for five minutes in front of a piano player.  Why?  No reason other than to watch him flop around for a while, and the movie continues on as usual immediately thereafter.  I started off hating myself for laughing at this one joke, and I don't want to go so far to say that I was won over by this, but I was definitely less irked by this than I imagined I was going to be.  It's filled with sight gags and buffoonery, but I really didn't end up groaning all that much.  Also, Neal McDonough is featured as the bad guy (type casting), and to be honest, he does elevate this to being above the bottom of the barrel.  The standout scene in this is him and Blart getting in a verbal spat, trying to one-up each other on how insane they are.  Anyway, this is still a bad movie that you shouldn't really take the time with, but surprisingly, there are worse movies out there.",

Some hilarious parts, and a lot of cringe scenes (you know what I'm talking about) that are essential to the character of the movies.\nThankfully, we didn't see a rehash of the same exact movie which is too common.  It had similar elements, of course, but not just a repeat of what was there before.\nFor me, Paul Blart:  Mall Cop 2 is funnier than the first.  To me, the emotional moments land better than the first, they are more believable.  For me, the action was awesome for what the movie is.  It was well planned and executed, again, for the Comedy that it is.  We saw it late in it's theatrical run and the house was packed, and most where having a great time.\nI highly recommend it as a good Comedy for the family.  Very funny.",

            "content": "I'm sure there were a few fans of the original film that were longing for the sequel but, seriously, come on now, it's not like there was huge clamoring for a sequel to the first film.  A film that wasn't that good to begin with.  Perhaps I gave the first film a break because Kevin James has a likable enough personality that I thought that people might gravitate towards that even if the film wasn't good.  And, in fact, people did gravitate to that and the film was pretty damn successful considering its minuscule budget.  But, and this has been a little over half a decade now, Kevin James just isn't that good of a comedic actor.  It's not like he ever was, but people found him so likable that they were willing to overlook the fact that he's just not all that talented.  That's why both Paul Blart films, essentially, are just one big 'fatty fall down' joke after the other.  Some people, in defense of James and others like him, would make the argument of if you were to take this same film and show it in the 20s or 30s that James would be regarded as a genius.  And that just couldn't be further from the truth.  To be fair, I just don't know what would happen, but James relies on a lot of laziness whereas Buster Keaton or Charlie Chaplin relied on their physicality because of they fact they weren't able to use to dialogue to tell their stories.  Chaplin made the transition to the talkies smoother than Keaton did, but Chaplin still had a way at adding a lot of heart and personality to films that featured a lot of slapstick.  Keaton was better at creating over-the-top physical stunts that no A-list actor, in this day and age, would actually perform.  The point is, that Keaton and Chaplin were both incredibly creative and innovative for the style of comedy they presented.  Kevin James is just repeating what others have done prior to him without any of the heart or creativity.  Again, he's just falling down because, you know, fat people falling over is funny.  It really doesn't surprise me that Kevin James had a hand in writing this film.  This is like a collection of deleted scenes from the first film that they thought would be a good idea to make a full-length film out of.  There's no way that this isn't how this film came about.  How else do you come up with a sequel to a film that nobody, in their right mind, probably loved?  It's either that or Adam Sandler just wanted to give one of his buddies more work, considering that almost nobody outside of Sandler actually casts Kevin James in their films.  It's not that I want James to go away, it's just that I want a little more effort to be put into the films he's in, instead of relying on what's cheap and easy.  The film has a few laughs, like Blart and the villain going back and forth on how crazy they are.  It's not like I would call this a hilarious scene, but it produced some chuckles.  And that's literally all I can remember.  There's also one ridiculously bad fight scene, which is understandable, but it's really fucking bad even by the low standards one has when watching a film of this type.  I know earlier I mentioned writing, but that would be offensive to the actual screenwriters that actually put in an effort to create stories.  I'm sure they still have to structure the film, but let's be honest here, not much effort was actually put into the script and I will be damned if someone tells me otherwise.  If you couldn't tell, this film was absolutely dreadful.  One of the worst of the year.  Though I am unsure of whether it was any worse than Grandma's Boy.  I will say this, Grandma's Boy may have been absolutely fucking awful, but I think they at least made a conscious effort at making a cult film.  I thought it was horrible and terribly unfunny, but there was some semblance of effort.  I can't say the same about this film.  I guess, in a way, this would have to be worse than Grandma's Boy, because it relied on everything that people hate about these comedies.  It was lazy and it relied on tired cliches and stereotypes.  It goes without saying that this is one of the worst films of the year, so far.  And Joe Dirt 2, another film from Sandler's production company, comes out this weekend.  So Paul Blart 2 will have some company among the worst films of the year category. I can't believe I paid to watch this.  It was $1.50, sure, but I still paid money to see rent this.  Maybe I was kinda hoping it might provide some unintentional laughs, but there's not even that.  This is an awful movie from beginning to end and it does nothing to improve Kevin James' image of relying of shitty and lazy 'fatty fall down' comedy.  Absolutely dreadful and please trust me when I say that you should avoid this at all costs.  I think Observe and Report is still out there in a $5 Walmart DVD bin somewhere.  That movie's strangely dark, but it's still vastly superior to both Blart films.  This, on the other hand, is fucking awful.",

            "content": "I LOVE Las Vegas! After multiple trips there, I'll watch any movie or TV show that features that beautiful and fun city. Unfortunately, that doesn't always work out for me. For every \"The Hangover\", there's something like \"The Incredible Burt Wonderstone\". So, when I saw the theatrical trailers for \"Paul Blart: Mall Cop 2\" (PG, 1:34), I said to myself, \"Self? You know something? This one has potential.\" Paging Burt Wonderstone.\n\n\"Paul Blart: Mall Cop 2\" is the sequel to the very profitable (read: low budget) \"Paul Blart: Mall Cop\" from 2009. Six years after thwarting a Black Friday heist at his local mall, and in spite of the original movie's tag line (\"Security Never Takes a Holiday\"), we now see Blart (Kevin James) and his daughter, Maya (Raini Rodriguez) on vacation in \"Fabulous Las Vegas\". Well, it's not completely a vacation. There's a security convention in town and Blart is hearing rumors he's going to be asked to be the convention's surprise guest speaker. And he's still the same old Blart - excessively proud of being a mall cop and insulted when someone doesn't give him his due, or give his job the respect that he feels it deserves.\n\nDuring the back-and-forth over whether Blart is giving that speech, thieves begin stealing the hotel's art - and kidnaps Blart's daughter and the hotel valet (David Henrie) that she's been talking to. In the inevitable face-to-face showdown between Blart and Vincent (Neal McDonough),the thieves' leader, Vincent has his henchmen and Blart has his fellow security officers, each one more... unusual than the last. Throughout Blart's attempts to stop the bad guys, he proves as resourceful and physically resilient as he was in the first movie, as do his back-ups. But when the ways they battle for truth, justice and Steve Wynn's art reminded me of the scene in \"Vegas Vacation\" when Cousin Eddie takes Clark to a casino with silly simple, but impossible-to-win table games. But even \"Pick a Number\" or \"Which Hand Is It In\" were more amusing than this film's marble gun or goop sprayer.\n\nOne subplot in the movie has Blart dealing with his beloved daughter's rapidly approaching departure for college, which will leave Blart even more alone than you'd think based on how the last movie ended. There's a definite family-friendly vibe in the Paul Blart movies. The conflicts lack any real danger (unless you count the many assaults on Blart's person, mostly born of his own clumsiness). There's no real profanity and no sexual content, but also a plot, characters and dialog that are so bland that they make dry toast look like a fancy Vegas buffet. I enjoy family-friendly comedies as much as the next open-minded movie reviewer, but I do expect them to be funny.\n\nThis movie is earnest and tame, but just not that enjoyable. The script is lazy and settles for bon mots like \"It's a bad day... to be a bad guy.\" James' delivery of supposedly comedic lines is so over-the-top that they're more likely to produce eye rolls than guffaws. He literally throws himself into the film's physical comedy, but the effect wears thin quickly. There are about four laugh-out-loud sight gags in the movie, but ONLY four - and they've probably already gotten their laughs out of you if you've seen a TV commercial or theatrical trailer for the movie. James' antics might give some kids a few giggles (very few), but there's not much here for adults to appreciate. Personally, I'd take James' work in his erstwhile TV series \"The King of Queens\" over most of his movie roles, including and especially this one.\n\nThis was the first film to receive Nevada's newly-enacted film tax credit. That's potentially a good news / bad news scenario. It'll probably mean more Sin City scenery splashed across the big screen... but that might mean I'll be subjecting myself to more cinematic suffering. Well, better me than you. After all, that's what our Facebook page is here for. So, instead of seeing this particular motion picture, I'd advise reading a nice family-friendly joke book... or taking a trip to your local mall. It's safe. \"Paul Blart: Mall Cop 2\" is fiction, grade \"D\" fiction.",

This has to be one of the laziest attempts at a comedy sequel i have ever seen. The structure is extremely unoriginal, just following the exact same formula as the last film from start to finish.

No? well neither do i, he is like a parody of his character from the first film thrown into a similar situation and makes a fool of himself every 5 minutes. Not only was the plot terrible, i had no idea what the actual plot was until almost half way into the movie, yes there are bad guys from the start but i had no idea what they were doing until like 45 minutes into the movie, maybe because it wasn't clear enough or i just didn't care. \n\nI must say i smirked like twice in the entire film, one of those times was seeing Kevin James get smashed into the side of a car, and so was the other time.

It also tries to shove some emotional crap down your throat the entire time and i actually bought some of that for like 5 minutes and then i remembered that i don't care. There were also a crap-load of secondary characters that all factor in through many side plots, most of which were there to fill the hour and 30 minute runtime. \n\nSo in the end, even Kevin James on a Segway could not save this pile of horse crap, do yourself a favour, and stay far away from this excuse of a comedy. - 1.7/10",

            "content": "I guess it was inevitable that we would see a sequel, the first movie was quite good fun I can't deny, unsure how well it did but most things get sequels these days. Hell I'm sure there will be a third too, because all the bigwigs like to make trilogies, its great for DVD sales.  But yeah...I did like the first movie somewhat, it was a reasonable idea, a mall cop thinking he's a real cop, trying to be a real cop, it worked on some levels.\n\nThe main pull for this franchise was/is of course Kevin James who uses his weight to gain laughs lets not beat around the bush. Admittedly I am a fan of the guy to a degree (said it before and I'll say it again), I think he's enjoyable, fun and effective with his physical gags, plus he's a good everyman that we the audience can relate too. Unfortunately he does seem to have had more success on TV than the big screen, and he's not helping himself here.\n\nThis movie is virtually the same shit that we saw in the first movie. Blart and his daughter go to a security convention in Vegas, low and behold at the exact same time a group of criminals are planning to steal all the valuable paintings from the same hotel Blart is staying in. Just like the first movie Blart blunders into the crime caper and ends up stopping it in his usual clumsy overweight manner, spoiler alert! he manages it. Oh...would a Las Vegas hotel have the Van Gogh Sunflowers painting in it?\n\nYep its the same as the first movie yet somehow its much worse, probably because its a babyish infantile pile of crap this time around. Seriously, the last movie has some good moments of sarcastic humour, this has nothing, its completely void of anything that would make an adult or child smile. Its bizarre, there literately isn't anything funny at all! not a single moment that made me smile. Hell there aren't any actual jokes! it pretty much consists of James making stupid faces (that aren't funny faces) and mincing around trying to be funny. What I really don't get is the franchises obsession with those Segway things, seriously there is an entire scene dedicated to trying to make out those things are funny. I realise its Blart's little trademark and part of his character but it isn't funny! watching him trying to show off on one isn't funny, its just lame.\n\nEverything else is completely predictable throwaway spiel we've seen a shitzillion times before. Blart's daughter is fat just like him, she falls for a good looking guy who is clearly out of her league and Blart doesn't like it, the main baddie looks like a Bond villain, the baddie henchmen are a standard bunch with a token black guy and token sexy females, the hotels security is headed by some uber sexy male hothead and the hotels general manager is a sexy supermodel type. The only thing they add here which had promise and showed some ingenuity, was the little gang of security officers that meet with Blart for the convention. A ragtag team of misfits that really shouldn't be in security...but are, clearly for reasons other than actual security. James older brother Gary Valentine stars in this as one of the aging, fat, balding security guards in this little gang. Again clearly meant to be a hilarious addition...but it isn't.\n\nThe whole security convention aspect could of been a winner, they did the same silly thing in the US TV version of 'The Office' with an office supply convention. Seeing that episode shows how funny this movie could have been in the right hands, even with James, the material was there (albeit a little bit of good material) but its been wasted. That one small idea does not make up an entire movie of course, and as already explained there is nothing else here of value. Even the apparent suspenseful finale where Blart takes down the bad guys is pathetic and not even up to the meager standards of the first movie! This could have been better with a slight adult edge, it was never gonna be great but it could of been better, but its not, its pretty darn terrible.",

            "content": "The first Paul Blart movie was fairly inoffensive. Much like its titular hero, it was buffoonish and loud and something to simply shrug and ignore the idiocy. It had a couple funny moments tweaking action movie conventions, less so with Kevin James' numerous pratfalls. The world didn't need a sequel beyond the demands of the first one making money. And much like the Die Hard sequels, the \"spiritual forbearer\" of Blart, our security guard finds himself miraculously being put in the same miraculous position again, this time in a different location. While Die Hard 2 is a fairly mundane follow-up, Paul Blart: Mall Cop 2 is a true test of everything we hold sacred. Midway into the movie, I thought my review was just going to be my unintelligible suicide note.\n\nBlart (James) is in Las Vegas for an annual security convention. He's brought along his teen daughter Maya (Rami Rodriguez) for some valuable father-daughter time, especially in light of Blart losing his wife and mother. It's at this convention where Blart runs across a team of art thieves lead by Vincent (Neal McDonough). It's up to the most unlikely mall security cop to save the day again, Vegas-style. Oh, and when traveling in Vegas, make sure to stay at the luxurious Wynn Casino and Hotel. Can I get a check too for the self-promotion like this movie?\n\nSomewhere along the way, James and co-writer Nick Bakay decided the lovable lug needed to be a modern-day Pagliacci and be the crying clown America deserves. The opening act feels like notorious cinematic sadist Lars von Trier designed it. In the opening minutes, Blart's wife (Jayma Mayes) divorces him not even a full week into marriage. She couldn't stop vomiting from the thought of being married to him (this literally happens). His mother is run over and killed by a milk truck. His daughter has been accepted into college but fears telling her father this joyous news because she doesn't want to push him over the edge. This and he's still emasculated and looked down upon by an assortment of industry peers at the Vegas convention. All of this culminates in Blart becoming a paranoid, overbearing bully who loses the sense of likeability that comes naturally to James even in dreck. Take a moment where Blart intervenes with his drunken friend. The guy has been obnoxiously making sexual advances on a woman (played by Adam Sandler's wife) who just wants her privacy respected, and Blart saves the day by... convincing the woman that she should be flattered by the drunk's advances. Yeah. He rejects his daughter's academic accomplishment and demands she attend a lesser school closer to home for his own selfish benefit. He's pushing her away. Then there's the weird ongoing joke about his arrogant assumption that an attractive hotel employee is hitting on him; he's dismissive of her throughout and, here's the weird part, it ends up working. She falls for him (\"I can't say no to you\"). That's right folks, Paul Blart successfully \"negged\" himself a date. He's not a loveable loser any more. He's just an angry, bullying, self-pitying loser. \n\nThere won't be a joke (I'll be charitable and refer to the as \"jokes\") that you won't see coming a mile away and still roll your eyes when they arrive. When the movie has an exotic bird walk out, you know it's only a matter of seconds before it comically engages in a fight with Blart. When he steps back onto the familiar confines of a Segwey, you know it's only a matter of seconds before he does something stupid. The crux of the humor of this movie is about 90 minutes of a fat guy falling down, and it still takes 47 minutes for the plot to get in gear. Let me repeat that for those in the cheap seats: a movie that is built upon the frail premise of being a Die Hard parody takes 47 unholy minutes to actually have its plot kick into gear. I watched Blart fight a stupid bird before the movie had the villain's scheme play out. Naturally, the film would have been bereft without that man-on-bird action (sorry to disappoint those who came here vis-\u00e0-vis a salacious SEO keyword search). Likewise we needed 28 shots of James falling over. Anything less would have been unacceptable to the viewing public. If you're going to be a dumb comedy just be a dumb comedy and don't waste my time. \n\nAnd oh what a dumb comedy it is. The first Blart film wasn't going to be confused with Tom Stoppard but it at least had some action conventions it could tweak. This go-round can't even manage that, and so we're inundated with tired slapstick and comedy that rarely rises above the most obvious joke at every opportunity. Blart gets ready to attack an intruder and, wouldn't you know it, he ends up punching an old lady. Hilarious. Even funnier is that the injured hospitality worker apologizes to her attacker. There's also a thinly disguised gay panic joke where Blart freaks out when a guy eats a brown banana. Who cares about how brown a banana is? At one point Blart hides inside a suitcase positioned at the top of the stairs. Why? Well so that the suitcase can fall down those stairs and hit the bad guy in the head. Don't you get it? He's fat. There are few comic setups or developments, no payoffs. Scenarios that should be comic, like Blart stumbling on stage of a Vegas dance show, are practically played straight, with the visual of Blart cavorting his large torso as the only joke itself. In case you forgot, he's fat.\n\nI should not have been expecting much from Paul Blart 2 simply by the choice of jokes highlighted in the trailer. If you wanted a cursory reminder, it included Blart fighting a bird, Blart punching an old lady, Blart running into a plate glass window, and Blart getting kicked by a horse in what should be a spine-obliterating accident. Let's take this last gag and really explore how it's indicative of Paul Blart 2. The foundation is a dumb act of slapstick, but that's not good enough and so it's exaggerated to even dumber magnitude. With the help of self-loathing CGI artists (they can't all be Jurassic World), Blart ricochets across a street and violently bounces against a car door. It's not enough that a horse kicks this guy; he has to get kicked by a super horse because it just wasn't funny enough. That sums up the comic ethic of Paul Blart 2: when stupid isn't enough, amp it further, and then be proud about what you've done. \n\nNate's Grade: D",

James, at least, seems like he was born to play the part. He does it well, even if what he does doesn't stretch him, or the material, very far. There's a fair bit of potential left in the tank if the filmmakers are willing to put in some effort instead of just recreating the first movie in a different environment.

You won't find much prompting an emotional reaction in general, so familiar are the jokes and situations. To his credit, director Andy Fickman (\"The Game Plan,\" \"Parental Guidance\") keeps the inanity moving apace and there are a few chuckles to be had courtesy of the supporting cast. But, as is so often the case with big, star-driven studio laffers, \"Cop 2\" needed several more spins in the comedy punch-up machine before cameras rolled. In the past, James at least had likability on his side. He was a big, lumbering oaf, the ideal drinking buddy. But there's an arrogance to the way he treats people here, particularly a gorgeous hotel employee he's convinced is in love with him, that renders him strangely unsympathetic. Sequels are cynical by nature, but this one, with its casino product placement ad and director Andy Fickman apparently checking his text messages instead of trying to punch the limp gags into shape, is purely a paycheck. James may not deserve better, but the kids they're pitching this to do. Is it never funny? No, it's not never funny. It's just not funny nearly often enough. Far from the worst movie that you'll ever see, but you might leave wondering why you, the people on the screen, or anyone else in the theater even bothered.\n\nVERDICT: \"Not So Hot\" - [Negative Reaction] These films are truly terrible films. They are not the worst things ever made, but they are definitely awful and should not be seen by anyone. (Films that are rated 1.5 or 2 stars)",

It had some stretches of flat jokes and silly humor that didn't quite work for me but there were several scenes (such as a non-lethal weapons expo, violent run-in with a large bird and Blart's version of 'the Smolder') paced throughout the film which made me laugh out loud. In short, it was silly but entertaining.\n\nTarget Audience: 10 year old boys or anyone else who's willing to enjoy a simple, family-friendly comedy. \n\nScore & Recommendation: 4/10 - I don't know that I would recommend seeing it in theaters but it would make a great Redbox night for the family.\n\nThis is a simple, low-budget film with minimal special effects and an inexpensive group of actors (most of whom you'll recognize from other Adam Sandler and Kevin James' films).\n\nPlot Summary: Paul Blart (Kevin James) is an under-appreciated security officer (a.k.a. Mall Cop) who is invited to a convention of his peers in Vegas. It just so happens that an art thief (Neal McDonough) and his crew are planning to steal several works of art from the casino during Blart's stay, which causes West Orange Pavilion Mall's shining hero to ride into action.\n\nWould I ever watch it again?  Maybe, especially if I was with someone else who hadn't seen it.  Was it what I would classify as a great comedy?  No, but that's okay.  I might have regretted it a bit if I had paid $7.50 to see it in theaters but, since it was free, it was totally worth it.\n\nFOR MORE FILM REVIEWS: check out my blog at www.cinemacommander.com.\n\nThanks!",

I also thought that this movie was pretty darn lol funny if you like movies that are dumb, loud, full of heart, composed and downright transcendent. This viewer thought it was a decent movie, although to be honest, I don't see why it is disliked, but can see why the average viewing in other countries didn't get it top praise - it still gets top praise from many people like me who thought it was just goofy and silly and dumb, with something for everyone. I have never had such goofy laughs in a movie. Making the audience laugh in an uproar. Pretty wild, but also sweet. It was somehow, someway a hooting hollering movie for this jaded and overcomplicated well done and over the hill movie watcher. I guess the kiddies are too unspoiled to enjoy something this ridiculous. I am old, you see? :)",

            "content": "There are good sequels, then there are bad ones. Unfortunately we get another one with Happy Madison Studios making the not-so-likable character Paul Blart in his sequel \"Mall Cop 2\".   Kevin James plays in the title role yet again as one of  New Jersey's well known mall cops this time he is more annoying and obnoxious than ever. I don't think I have sat through a movie looking at a character more annoying than any of the other bad characters I have seen in other bad movies. Actor Kevin James has spoken out about liking this character (for whatever reason) and had the idea of making a sequel. \n\nThe movie begins with Paul Blart, who had just got married and started to have a new life; that is until his wife divorces him after six days of marriage. This is ridiculous as it sounds but it gets more distressing after only five minutes in. Paul's mother goes out for a newspaper, and then is randomly run over by a milk truck. It suddenly goes from sad to dark just minutes apart. After Paul's mother randomly dies. his daughter gets accepted into UCLA, but she does not want to tell her father because she thinks it will hurt his feelings. They then take a trip to Las Vegas, Nevada to go on vacation. \n\nThen the problems go on from there. There are so many gags and offensive jokes through out the entire movie. For example, the Segway that Paul shows off to two lousy men later in the movie is only there to extend the movie's duration time in order to get to the ninety minute mark. There are countless amount of these scenes in the movie that it makes the film boring instead of reaching its goal to be funny. \n\nSpeaking of which, where is the comedy in this movie? None of the jokes are original and don't make any sense. I waited patiently for ninety minutes waiting for a funny moment to happen, but it never came. There are times where the movie adds in a random scene to make the movie look more ridiculous and redundant. There is one particular scene where Paul Blart attacks an African Crane, this scene tries to make Paul look like a funny guy, but really, he is being a jerk and shows that he is very easy to annoy. \n\nThis isn't Happy Madison Studios' first film to have a sequel worse than its predecessor, Grown Ups 2, Joe Dirt 2 are both examples of bad films that the Studio should listen to the criticism in order to make their film better. \n\n\"Criticism is a lesson\"- 30 Cents.",

There were definitely some memorable moments in this movie, such as the part where the team of mall cops beat up the others who are opposing them. This scene was particularly awesome because it seamlessly combined the silliness of the cops with the action and adventure that the move was sought out to be. I give this movie 5/5 starts because not only did it exceed its expectations, but it also created a higher standard for action/adventure movies in the future.",

Loud, broad, and god-awful, Paul Blart: Mall Cop 2 plays out like a bad kid's movie mistakenly marketed to adults. An incompetent, he pratfalls about while facing basic challenges. An annoyance, he embarrasses his daughter while being overbearing. An unfortunate, he stumbles into victory purely by accident. An irritant, he gets rendered unlikable by putting him - and audiences - through the same sad paces as in the last go-roundwhich was pure garbage. The script renders him so incompetent, annoying, unfortunate, and irritating that moviegoers end up hating this ne'er-do-well--not sympathizing with him unfunny failure. A forced second helping of a cold dish that few people enjoyed to begin with, this sequel re-heats and adds more of the Z-grade shtick that made 2009s Paul Blart: Mall Cop so utterly painful to watch.\n\nIn this PG-rated comedy, mall cop Paul Blart (James) heads to Las Vegas for a Security Guard Expo with his teenage daughter (Rodriguez), only to discover a heist that hes intent on foiling. \n\nA poor man's Chris Farley, Kevin James fills the fat funny man vacancy in Adam Sandler's stable of stars. A frequent Sand-man collaborator, this former star of CBS's King of Queens realized this lovable lunk role again (I Now Pronounce You Chuck and Larry) and again (The Zookeeper). In fact, with Grown Ups, which was filled with just about ONLY ex-SNL castmates (Sandler, Chris Rock, David Spade, Chris Nealon), he took on a role that would've been Farley's for the taking had he lived (unlike James, Farley was an SNL cast member from the same period as the aforementioned). The difference? Farley killed both slapstick and cerebral comic patter. James nails only the former...and barely. Relegated to PG-rated buffoonish clowning thats not entertaining to neither children NOR adults, his Paul Blart: Mall Cop is an unfunny failure as both a character and as a comedy.\n\nBottom line: Mall Rots",

And the only other movie available was \"Paul Blart: Mall Cop 2,\" with which I was entirely unfamiliar. But it was rated a mere PG, the equivalent of a G rating back in my day, so I figured what the heck. Coming out of the theater, I realized the banality of \"Paul Blart: Mall Cop 2,\" had rendered me senseless. My niece Francesca looked up at me, and she said, and I'll never forget this, I even wrote it down so I would remember, \"out of the mouths of babes\" and all that, she said simply: \"Uncle Bill, that festering pile of cow dung was so rancid, I hope to Christ I never hear the name Paul Blart again. Ever! This film has scarred me for life. And who is this fat f*ck Kevin James? He thinks he's funny?! I've had bowel movements that have elicited more laughs than anything that came out of that fat f*ck's mouth the entire film. And the makers of this wretched filth are so desperate that they have to dig up the likes of a D-lister like former SNL star-and mind you, I'm using the term 'star' loosely-Molly Shannon? F*ck me. Arguably the only way Molly Shannon ever could be funny would be if she were forced to sit in a hot-tub with Rob Schneider and Ving Rhames, who both were suffering from acute irritable bowel syndrome. What did 'Paul Blart 2' cost to make? 20 mill? 30 mill? Why not just skip making the movie, write a check for $30 million, send it to an irritable bowel syndrome charity, and call it a day?! F*ck this sh*t. Just gimme my binky and let's go home.\" I must say I pretty much agreed with her take. \"Paul Blart: Mall Cop 2\" essentially is the apex of American mediocrity. For this horrific misstep, I think I owe my Goddaughter a pony.",

Talk about a strange choice.

            "content": "From the people that gave us the first Paul Blart film gives us a second with the plainly titled Paul Blart Mall Cop 2, a movie that is here and I honestly have no idea why. The first film wasn't a good film as it was just a very kid freindly version of Die Hard and while it's appeal was limited there was a level of heart that came with it. This second movie falls into the same situation but it still falls short of even the first film's low standards. The story this time revolves around Paul Blart going to Las Vegas for a security convention but a villainous thief tries to steal all of the hotel's art and it is up to Paul Blart to save the day. I am not exaggerating any of this, that is actually the story. The film obviously struggles from the very beginning but let's talk about the very few thing's that work here. The main thing that works in the film is actually Kevin James in the title role. James does deliver a very heartfelt performance and actually makes the movie a little bit more tolerable. Neil McDonough plays the villain and he gives it his all but the script is so bad it undermines everything. The script here is filled to the brim with jokes that aren't funny and throwaway characters that you will never remember after you see the movie. The comedy the script throws at us is mainly fat jokes. One or two would have been funny, but every scene has a fat joke and then they follow it up with a poor attempt at physical comedy. The best of these are actually seen in the trailer and even those aren't very appealing. Director Andy Fickman drops the ball here in more ways than agreeing to make this movie. His editing here is just shoddy to say the least and the use of CGI in some scenes is so obvious that the SyFy channel wouldn't even use it. To top it all off the ending of this film is just so cheesy you actually hate the film a bit more. Overall there is no use in dragging this review out longer than it has to be. Paul Blart Mall Cop 2 is just a extremely bad movie that we didn't even want to be made. James and McDonough try to make this work but this is just a terrible film that nothing could have saved it. Skip Paul Blart 2 and watch something else on Netflix instead.",

The television show King of the Hill. Paul and Hank Hill are exactly alike and have barely any differences in appearance and most of all personality. They are both stupid and could not be funny if they wanted to be funny. Bobby from King of the Hill and Maya Blart (Paul's daughter) have a shocking resemblance. They are both very stupid and count on their dad for everything despite their fathers being big, dumb, ugly, poop-inducing idiots. Finally the similarity between the Mom who did not get much screen time in the movie and Peggy Hill. You see the Mom nags Paul and Maya and does not shut up and let me try to enjoy this shitfest. Much like in King of the Hill when she is annoying and does not pertain at all to the non-existent plot or Hank's crappy adventures. I play the Tenor Saxophone and I know when I see a bad horn. The bad horn is Paul Blart mall Cop 2",

Starring Kevin James as our Christ and Saviour, we pray that he one day will release Paul Blart 3: Reveng of Jamal to the general public, but for now only Shaq and Gandhi are allowed to watch it for now. Blart's struggle with diabetes is very relatable to many people around the world, with Blart having a sugar induced seizure being a climatic scene. The setting of Jamal is very enticing, with Jamal playing the token black guy that eats fried chicken, drinks watermelons, plays basketball, and starts riots in Baltimore. In fact, Paul rides into Baltimore on his baller segway in a crucial scene in which he says to the rioters: Get out of my mall, jamal. In a mass suicide never seen before, the entire city commited sudoku on the spot (spoilers!). It really defines Blart as an american hero, destined to kill the army of negroes created by Jamal. Before this movie, I have stage 5 terminal brain cancer, but now I am on the list of the world's top ten healthiest people, tied with Robin Williams for number one (Paul Blart is ommitted from the list since he is too pure.). The movie ends with Blart going 88 miles per hour on his segway, taking Michael Fox to 1966 and destroying the 3rd Reich in an epic knife fight against mein glorious fuhrer, Mohammad Ali himself. After winning in a homage to the first movie, Blart frees all of the jews from their cages so they can once again work minimum wage at the local costco.  This movie is literally god itself. You will laugh. You will cry. You will ejaculate all over the child in front of you as Paul Blart: Mall Cop 2: Return to Jamal starts playing. Jesus Christ died for this movie, if he were alive today he would kill himself so they could make another, thats how good this fuckin movie is. You are literal shit scum if you dont watch this movie, and you will die a horrible, painful death, knowing you couldn't watch this masterpiece. I was homeless, now Im not. Thats how good this movie was. This has been Paul Blart with your Channel 7 news, stay safe, and stay in the theaters, watching Paul Blart 2: Revenge of Jamal.",

This Die Hard-inspired comedy \"franchise\" has now just added a very pointless sequel. \n\nTaking place in Las Vegas, Nevada, Paul Blart: Mall Cop 2 stars Kevin James as Paul--a bumbling mall cop who takes his job way too seriously. Now he's in Vegas for a security convention where he must stop a heist of the casino.\n\nThe entire film takes place within the confines of the Wynn Resort and Casino. There is no galavanting around the strip or hopping from casino to casino--so the should-be glamorous Vegas element is very glamourless.\n\nAs flippant as the first film is, this one adds insensitivity to the equation. The movie starts out by picking up where we left Blart last in his life--when he gets married. But we find out that his wife leaves him after 6 days. This is a character we really grow to like in the previous film and love the fact that she seems to adore Paul regardless of his clumsy ways. And then Paul's mom--whom he lives with--dies by getting run over by a milk truck. This is all supposed to be funny, but instead it's a jarring beginning for the few fans of the first film. \n\nOverall, it's much of the same criticisms from the its predecessor, except more. There are maybe 3 solid laughs in the whole movie--but the rest of the jokes fall flat and are yawn-worthy. However, those 3 laughs may be bigger than the biggest laughs from the first film. Although in the first film there were way more of them. In this one, the highlight may be the bird-attack scene--which is played off to its brightest potential and gets the biggest laugh. One of Paul's cohorts is a security guard named Khan (Shelly Desai) who had most of the other laughs, but was grossly underutilized in this movie.\n\nAt least, in the end, there is a redeeming value to all of this. But then again, we could've just watched the first film twice.\n\nTwizard Rating: 59",

He arrives at the hotel and is ready for the meeting - only to find out his daughter is getting cozy with one of the hotel's younger employees.  This is something he tries to put a stop to.\n\tBut while those odd things are going on, a group of thieves are trying to replace original artwork in several hotels and casinos with fakes.  The thieves intend to sell the original artwork for a lot of money.\n\tAnd you guess it - it's up to Paul Blart - along with several fellow mall cops - to stop the heists.\n\nSCORING\nMain Characters\n\tPaul Blart really gives it his all.  He's the one that drives the movie (as a comedy).  As for his daughter, she does have a few good moments, but she really doesn't shine as well as he does.  SCORE: 7\n\nSupporting Cast\n\tThe only member of the rest of the cast that's noteworthy is the worker in the hotel who slowly falls for Paul Blart.  \n\tHowever, the bad guys are really bland, and I felt like a lot of them were taken from you typical James Bond film (including their inability to hit where they are aiming.)  SCORE: 4\n\nPlot\n\tThe plot is okay, but there are far too many points where the characters overhear a critical piece of information (in other words, it's really contrived.)  SCORE: 4\n\nOriginality\n\tPaul Blart's giving it is all, but the rest of the film feels like your average heist film gone wrong.  SCORE: 4\n\nViolence Factor\n\tOne moment Paul Blart can't this a target from five feet away, and the next he's a perfect shot with that weapon (really).\n\tBesides, there are too many moments where the bad guys could've shot a good guy - and miss because they're such bad shots.  SCORE: 4\n\nOther Moral Issues\n\tThis film is supposed to be about how one average man can make a huge difference in the security business.  It's too bad the rest of the cast just don't hold up their end of the bargain.  SCORE: 4\n\nFinal Score (out of 60): 27\t\t\t% Score: 45%\nPaul Blart makes the film fun - everyone else makes this film forgettable.",

Some of the greatest comedy's like Horse Feathers with Marx Brothers,  Any three stooges flick, Laurel and Hardy, etc., etc.  They had little to no plots, but made you laugh and feel good.  Know what I liked most about this film - there were no bad words, it was clean cut, it didn't need sexual overtones, it was just good clean fun.   Will it win an oscar, no way, but it doesn't need to.

He takes along daughter Maya in order to spend more time with her before she heads to college. But nothing can be easy and when Blart learns about a heist about to go down, he does everything in his power to stop it.\n\nThe first Paul Blart: Mall Cop I thought was pretty terrible and not that funny, I haven't spoke to anyone who liked the first film so why the hell is they a squeal? maybe for money well if that's the case that back fired as this movie failed at the box office so that's money down the f**king drain. Damn you HollyWood for producing movies like this only for money and nothing else just to insult your auditions who went out of they way to pay and see your movie.\n\nThe whole running joke in the movie is fat Kevin James falling over or getting hurt by many different things around him and my god dose this movie repeat it. That is bad and lazy writing right there when your only joke is that. Is that what you could think of seriously?.\n\nThe acting from everyone was bad even Kevin James just did the stick in the mood \"Hey I'm Kevin James\", acting like in every movie he's been in. I know Kevin James is better than this and I actually like the guy in real life and I'm not here wanting him to fail, no I want him to pick roles were he's not just playing Kevin James in his past movies.\n\nPaul Blart is a mall cop and you think his in the mall all through out the movie, nope most of the movie his far away from the mall and he's in Vegas and he still wears the uniform and drives around in that stupid electric mall cop scooter.

It's a Happy Madison productions and it's like someone is afraid to tell the emperor he is naked. Just because you think of something doesn't make it funny. These Segway sight gags and a few more like scenes that let Kevin James \"act up\" really look like they were one take events. Sorry, no matter how effortless good comedy looks it takes some planning and practice, too many of these scenes just look like the stage directions were...fling your arms around for a while and then fall down.

In this sequel, Blart is invited as a distinguished guest to a conference of security officers in an upscale hotel in Las Vegas, Nevada and as chance would have it is the keynote speaker. In the background, a heist is being perpetrated by one of the hotel's guests to steal priceless art from its gallery and replace it with forgeries. Blart catches wind of this plot, and in John McClane style, takes down the villain's goons one-by-one, culminating in a zipline across the Las Vegas skyline. This movie has a 0% on rotten tomatoes from critic reviews. While I found the movie mostly dumb and inane, I certainly don't think it warrants a 0%. I at least found the movie passing, though admittedly not good. There are too many subplots in the movie, such as Blart's overprotective daddy issues and a family dynamic that feels out of place in a heist comedy. Smith does his best given the script, but it feels like he's there to be comic relief rather than a tangible, sympathetic lead. There were parts of the film I enjoyed, but some devolved into sheer idiocy. This is not a remarkable film but it has enough entertainment value to be a reasonable diversion from everyday life. Rather than spending full price in the theater, you may be better suited scoping this out on Red Box and having a nice laugh with the kids. I feel Kevin Smith deserves better than being typecasted as comic relief fodder ------------------------------------------------------------------ C",

Upon rediscovery, I gave it an astounding four stars. Indeed there are aspects in the first that make it more enjoyable than its sequel, which got a whopping 0% from critics. Seeing it out of both irony and to see if it was really that bad, yep, it was. It's overall boring, with so many jokes that fall flat and James falling on his ass and swerving around with segways.\nThe bumbling mall cop Paul Blart goes to Las Vegas to receive an award for his \"brave efforts\" - his teenage daughter is once again kidnapped by a group of art thieves, posing as hotel employees. Blart attempts to thwart them, it works unrealistically, it goes along so predictably.\nThe overexaggeration of Blart falling, being hit or kicked by animals, and his especially dull group of fellow cops in town for a convention makes the movie so boring. What makes it especially boring is it's like an hour and a half long tourism ad for a Vegas hotel, Blart is only in a mall for around 4 minutes in the beginning, seeing the same interiors over and over gets so dull. Blart's fat jokes and awkward laughs fall short, he tries to prove himself to be more fatherly in the sequel, looking back at the first he was a cliched but likable character in some aspects. Here, he's such a painful \"heroic\" fat cop stereotype. Paul Blart rightfully earns the title of the worst movie in the past 5 years that I've seen, out of Sandler films and Parental Guidance, Blart conquers only in making viewers cringe.",

Kevin James returns as the annoying fat Mall Cop, who goes on vacation, and when the Hotel is being attacked, Blart is the only one for the job. Look, the first one was okay. It had some laughs, but it definitely did NOT deserve a sequel. The character of Paul Blart IS funny and a GOOD character. But the script and the writing are so bad, that people end up thinking the worst of him. They should have stayed in the Mall, because having Blart at the hotel just is not right. The film could give you some chuckles, but you will never DIE laughing. This film proves that the Film Green-Lighters have no idea what they are doing. For Example: There is going to be a TRILOGY on the Pitch Perfect series. And a Transformers Marvel-Inspired-Universe. People in a few years will be sick of Hollywood.\n\nOverall: Paul Blart 2 is what people thought it was going to be. As there is just NOTHING good in this movie. It is basically the first one, just in a Hotel in Vegas. Definitely one of the year's worst.\n\nRating: 11% and a D-",

Only through PBMC2's fictional angle and slow motion camera work, and the everyman in the Midwest nature du humaine in Paul Blart, can we reach a state of heightened reality where people in our country can accept that mall cops put their lives on the line for the greater good of everyone.The black-and-white simplicity of the mission - move in, clear this, capture that, get out - become trampled into a morass of moral greyness. In that sense, Paul is a typical Eastwoodian hero: another lone gunman on a wild frontier, trying his best to square his actions with his code. Is he a cowboy, so addicted to his adrenaline rush that he's heedless of danger to himself and the men in his unit? Or is he, by virtue of his experience and talents simply better suited than a traditional policeman at estimating acceptable risk and getting the job done? PBMC2  doesn't engage the politics of war per se, but it blows a hole in the facile explanation offered by society that their concern is doing their job to the best of their ability and trying to make sure everyone gets home in one piece. In practice, nothing is that simple or clear-cut.",

            "content": "In early 2009, Kevin James starred in the family-friendly answer to Die Hard known as Paul Blart: Mall Cop! Set in a mall in New Jersey, the film was a major success hoovering about $146m in the U.S itself. Weirdly it has taken six years for the inevitable sequel to arrive. Frankly, I hated the the first installment, it was loud & overbearing, in other words just too Kevin James aka filled with just fat jokes! Another film that released the same here with a very similar concept Observe & Report (starring Seth Rogen) was a way better film in my opinion. However, after the genre trappings of the first film, it's only logical that the sequel turns out to be a family-friendly Die Hard 2. That is to say, it's basically the first one, all over again, in a different location and somehow better. The story follows six years after the event of the 1st film, as the over-zealous mall security guard Blart (Kevin James) is afraid that he has peaked personally - his wife (Jayma Mays) left him six days into the marriage & his mother (Shirley Knight) gets hit by a milk truck . An invite to a prestigious security convention in Las Vegas, all expenses paid, cheers him up a little, and he takes his long-suffering daughter Maya (Raini Rodriguez) along for the ride. However, dastardly high roller Vincent (Neal McDonough) is planning to put Vegas' world-famous security to the test by robbing the hotel where the convention is being held. Though racked by his own ego, Blart stumbles upon their plot and teams up with fellow convention delegates to save the day. Having started on awkward form, the film sets itself into old school physical humor, which Kevin James is actually good at -  Repeated auto-accidents, running into clear glass windows and getting beat up by a peacock are just par for the course. Aside from all the \"fat man fall down\" jokes that persist throughout James' filmography, the sequel also reprises the previous film's  running joke, about Blart's hypoglycemia. Yes, Paul Blart is an idiot. He's also gluttonous, clumsy, overbearing, self-deluded, and obnoxious. He's a veritable personification of the seven dullest sins, which the movie celebrates, inviting us to laugh at Blart as he stuffs his face, trips over things, and generally behaves like a buffoon. Blart is the protagonist as punching bag. No, wait, he's the protagonist as misunderstood everyman: Lonely. Hard-working. Just trying to do his best in an unfriendly world. All he does is to earn the love in order to avoid being lonely. Like from his daughter, Maya, who is willing to sacrifice everything for him and forgo acceptance at UCLA because she cannot bear to leave her childlike father alone. Like from the hotel manager (Daniella Alonso) and head of security (Eduardo Ver\u00e1stegui), whose rightful disdain for Blart as he blunders onto their turf and acts like an entitled moron will inevitably morph into literal adoration. If director Andy Fickman initially cannot decide if he wants us to laugh at Blart or cheer him on, he eventually comes down on the side of Blart Is Awesome! While the film may receive some harsh comments about the humor, I beg to say what do you expect from a film produced by Adam Sandler? It is going to find ways to make you laugh with its ridiculous gags, which may not be everyone's cup of tea! In the original 2009 film, Kevin James stepped out of Adam Sandler's shadow for the role of a lifetime, something which he is clearly good at! Neal McDonough as the film's villain has some funny moments as well! Especially his conversations with Blart on who is more crazier! James, who again co-writes the sequel with Nick Bakay, clearly has aimed at an audience even lower than producer Adam Sandler does in his own movies - the kids! On the whole, Paul Blart Mall Cop 2 may not be the best comedy out there, nor is it the worst! For people who enjoy physical comedies & don't mind films from Happy Madision (Adam Sandler films), will surely be entertained by this sequel, while the rest can avoid!",

What it truly lacked was a villain.\n\nSo roll around the sequel, unfortunately what worked in the first Mall Cop is taken to the extreme and doesn't come off as charming as it did first time around.\n\nThe fact is this film is a mess in terms of storylines and at times appears it's an ode to Kevin James' ego which at times is jarring considering how much this sweet sensitive guy in the first one has become bigger bafoon than before. The rebellious daughter/overbearing father storyline is dragged to it's obvious conclusion.\n\nThe villains in this movie outwith the main two characters are just as interchangeable as they were in the first film. Though the plus side is Neal McDonough (TVs Justified Season 3) is particularly amusing when he gets flustered. Another storyline involves Danielle Alonso's hotel manager who on upon meeting Paul is told that she is attracted to Paul, and she is told this by Paul himself (ode to ego?) and by the end she is enamoured by Paul, which was a very cringeworthy storyline.\n\nNow there are two genuinely hilarious scenes in this film, the first scene is when Blart comes face to face with some sort of bird (possibly an osterich) in the hotel greenery area as he and the bird duke it out, the bird gets some good pecks and kicks in which offers genuine hilarity. The second genuine scene which made me laugh out loud was when Neal McDonough's character and Kevin James' character come face to face in a hilarious dialogue scene where they try to say how crazy they are compared to each other.\n\nOverall for me this film was a big disappointment, outwith those two scenes described above the laughs for the most part were cringeworthy, the story wasn't particularly engaging and it lacked the charm of the original. One to watch if you love Kevin James films otherwise you won't be missing anything special.",

There were not many expectations to be looking forward too, especially from the Happy Madison production company that Adam Sandler usually produces. Most of their films are going downhill with their lackluster comedy films. Mall Cop 2 is one of them; it carries the same humor that was in the 2009 predecessor. Yes, the first movie was fair and had some comical moments. The sequel is redoing the same humor, and it is rather eye rolling annoying than funny. Kevin James produces, wrote, and stars again in his film and the movie is filled with same repetitive fat jokes, redundant slapstick humor, and cringing bad one-liners.\n\n The plot takes place six years after the first movie; Paul Blart (Kevin James) is trying recover from some unexpected events. He goes on a trip with his daughter Maya (Raini Rodriguez) to a security officer convention in Las Vegas. Then, a gang lead by Vincent (Neal McDonough) is plotting to steal the artwork in that hotel. Paul has taken to his responsibility to stop them.\n\n\n The plot is ridiculous, and filled with the repetitive clich\u00c3 (C)s that we all have seen before. Paul and Maya are now struggling with the father and daughter relationship, as Maya is growing up and trying to live a life of her own by making new friends and her protective father is restricting her. There are other characters that are also introduced in the movie, but are written one-dimensional which makes it forgettable. Paul Blart Mall Cop 2 is a horrible film; it does show Kevin James and his lack of creativity in bringing new humor to the sequel but ends up falling back to a repeat of the original movie.",

The mother thanks Paul and tells her son to hug him. The boy instead smacks Paul and runs off again. Paul's daughter Maya (Raini Rodriguez) just got her acceptance letter to UCLA. Paul gets a letter inviting him to a security officers convention in Las Vegas. Thinking this could be something big for him, he announces this to Maya and invites her to join him.

Woodside, Eduardo Verastegui, Gary Valentine, Vic Dibitetto, Nicholas Turturro, Ana Gasteyer, Geovanni Gopradi and Shirley Knight.\n\n\"Paul Blart: Mall Cop 2\" has stabbed film criticism in the heart. It is soulless, lifeless, unfunny, putrid and worthless. It's one of the worst movies of this or any other year. Is this finally it for Kevin James? Has he run out of jokes? You're the King of Queens! You should know better. The only joke James can think of is the \"fat man falling down\" joke. He has repeated this joke to death. Apparently, James never met a \"fat man falling down\" joke he didn't like. Anyways, back to the larger point, why does \"Paul Blart: Mall Cop 2\" even exist? Why did it take James and Sony Pictures six years to make a sequel? Why should we even care about Paul Blart anyway? He's like Homer Simpson if he had hair, a badge and a police scooter. These two guys may not have a brain in their heads but Homer at least had memorable catchphrases and a decent job, Paul Blart is barely anything at all.\n\nThe first \"Paul Blart\" movie (which grossed an astonishing $186 million worldwide) was stupid and lazy but at least James was hard-working. Believe it or not the sequel is even worse than I thought it was going to be. There's barely a plot here, it's just Kevin James taking a nice vacation to Las Vegas and falling down over and over and over again. After the events of the first film, Paul (James) gets a notice in the mail saying his wife, Amy (Jayma Mays) has left him after just six days of marriage. To make matters worse for Blart, his mother (Shirley Knight) gets run over by a milk truck. Paul's long-suffering daughter, Maya (Raini Rodriguez) just got accepted to UCLA but she doesn't know how to tell her father because he is damaged and lonely. Paul also gets a letter in the mail, it's an invitation to go to a security officers convention in Las Vegas. WOW! Mr. James you won a free trip to Las Vegas! Did you win the trip by going on Wheel of Fortune or was it payed for by Columbia Pictures? \n\nMeanwhile, a group of art thieves led by Vincent (Neal McDonough) want to steal priceless paintings from the Wynn hotel. While his daughter hangs out with a young parking attendant (David Henrie), Paul is led to believe that he is the key note speaker of the security convention. When Maya gets kidnapped by Vincent, it is up to John McClane, I mean Paul Blart to save the day.\nHow did Paul Blart drained my soul away from my body? He has a fight with an angry peacock, he stumbles into a production of \"Le Reve\", the big Cirque du Soleli water show, he encounters a Mini KISS tribute band on an elevator, and he takes out the bad guys by shooting bean bags and marbles at them. Yes, ladies and gentlemen, the filmmakers are still mining this material as if \"Home Alone\" never happened. \n\n\"Paul Blart: Mall Cop 2\" is like a lot of other Happy Madison productions, it has weak slapstick, annoying characters, product placement, a fake heart at the end and it's essentially a vacation disguised as a movie. The direction by Andy Fickman (Parental Guidance, You Again and She's the Man) is so lazy, I'll bet he walked away from the camera to either play poker or hit the slot machines in a casino somewhere. The sequel was written by James and Nick Bakay (who is capable doing better work as well). \n\nSince he thought making \"Paul Blart 2\" was so much fun, James dragged genuinely funny people like Loni Love, Nicholas Turturro, former \"SNL\" cast member Ana Gasteyer and even his own brother, Gary Valentine into this mess as well. James has taken the word obnoxious to a whole new level because he transforms Paul Blart into a rude, self-absorbed, over-protective idiot of a father to his daughter. Naturally, his wild behavior makes the beautiful general manager of the hotel fall in love with him. Okay?... Why do you think Paul Blart is so attractive?\n\nWhen you're watching an awful comedy like this, you expect to groan or roll your eyes but here, the jokes don't fly at all, James just assumes that these situations are going to be funny of themselves. Since the movie was mostly shot at the Wynn hotel, Steve Wynn has an awkward cameo at the end with a speech balloon on his head that reads: \"Why did I contribute money to this piece of $&@?\"\nSeveral days after it was released, \"Paul Blart: Mall Cop 2\" scored a perfect 0% at Rotten Tomatoes but the rating was increased to just 6%. Let's just pretend that \"Paul Blart 2\" still has a 0% rating because the three critics who gave it a positive review are completely out of touch with the film world. Bruce Bennett, Jim Schembri and Simon Weaving should be ashamed of themselves for giving this awful movie a thumbs up. \n\nAmong the jokes that don't work in this movie, when Blart is lying face-down on the floor, he crawls underneath a child's dripping ice cream cone just to increase his blood sugar and when Blart runs into a production assistant of \"Le Reve\", a disturbing scene happens, he eats a brown banana. Neal McDonough isn't given anything to do either, we learn that his character is allergic to oatmeal. Gee, I wonder what's going to happen to him at the end? When Blart finally encounters Vincent, they scream silly lines to each other. Here's one of them: \"I will bring a folk guitar to a pumpkin fight, because that's how crazy I am!\". Finally what is up with the young hotel valet who has all day to hang out with the daughter? Do you even work at the Wynn hotel? \n\nWhat happened to you Kevin James? You were a likable person, you were funny on TV and in \"Hitch\" but here you only managed to make \"Zookeeper\" look like \"Boyhood\". Placing itself as one of the worst sequels of all time, \"Paul Blart: Mall Cop 2\" officially marks the death of film criticism as we know it.",

            "content": "With Paul Blart: Mall Cop effectively getting worse with every year of age that passed me and Paul Blart: Mall Cop 2 being more critically panned than its predecessor, I felt like I needed to see just how low the film could sink.\n\nTo my surprise, Paul Blart: Mall Cop 2 was actually a significant improvement over its predecessor. That isn't necessarily the biggest piece of credibility due to the fact that Paul Blart: Mall Cop was simply dreadful.\nThe intro to Paul Blart: Mall Cop 2 is just dark. The titular character gets dumped by his wife six days into marriage, slapped by a child who won't hug him and then his mother is killed by a milk truck which is shown on screen. The humour is oddly dark for the mere intro to the film, and it doesn't precisely set the film up to be funny. If anything, I was laughing because the general idea of it all was just so stupid that I couldn't believe someone actually considered it a good idea. In actual fact, the level of ridiculousness in the film actually achieves humourous results because the entire thing is so damned stupid that the very idea of it actually being produced is able to create comedic results. Aside from the tedious character subplots, Paul Blart: Mall Cop 2 genuinely had a better story to it than its predecessor. Part of this is because Paul Blart: Mall Cop 2 at least has better villains. The first one had a bunch of MTV stunt performers pretending to be criminals, but Paul Blart: Mall Cop 2 attempts to be slightly more serious with the use of familiar yet more believable antagonists. The story is certainly far from ground breaking, but it at least puts more focus into delivering on its generic contract in terms of cheap gags and random sketches.\nWhat Paul Blart: Mall Cop 2 calls character building is actually just an extended period of generic plot points which are short on genuine dramatic strength, rarely funny and rather familiar. But since the film paces itself more energetically, it doesn't focus on this too much. The budget of Paul Blart: Mall Cop 2 is a meager $4 million larger than its predecessor, yet the money is distributed more evenly this time around. Instead of the film relying too heavily on slow character building, the nature of everyone has already been established by the first film and this sequel just attempts to build off it. The budget is spent more on lively scenery and ridiculous stunts than anything, though the film manages to keep itself on a low budget the entire time. Admittedly, one of the negative results of this is the second-rate visual effects, but it is merely one of the flawed technical elements in a film which has a steady amount of colourful imagery. The change of setting is nice because the natural life of the hotel from all its glamourous lights to sparkling pools certainly lights up the screen, and it is all captured with nice cinematography.\nPaul Blart: Mall Cop 2 is intended to be an action comedy like its predecessor, but due to a story that takes itself slightly more seriously than the significantly more childish nature of the first one, there is a greater use of action this time around. Spread out sensibly over the short 90 minute running time, the pace of the film is made better by a greater moderation between over the top stunt gags and other attempts at humour. Sometimes, the over the top energy of the film actually proves entertaining, and the fast pace of it all keeps some level of consistent movement going on, effectively ensuring that the film does not mess around with frustrating drama all that much. \nTo put it simply, Paul Blart: Mall Cop 2 is obviously not a good film. It's story is generic, its humour is repetitive and there is a general feeling of predictability in it all. But thanks to a sporadic collection of unexpectedly over-the-top humour and an energetic effort from Kevin James, it isn't necessarily a boring one if viewed in the correct state of mind.\nThough I expected Paul Blart: Mall Cop 2 to be unfunny, I did hold hopes that would find some level of enjoyment in the performance of Kevin James. And in all essence, I did. Kevin James' natural comedic energy makes him a genial presence in Paul Blart: Mall Cop 2, and it elevates the thin writing of the film to some mild extent of comic success. The fact that Kevin James takes the role so seriously is entertaining because he manages to actually take a stand as a legitimate action hero while also keeping it at such a level where it remains within the confines of a juvenile comedy. The man's insistence on injecting all his energy into the physical humour of the film is actually admirable on some level as the jokes are extremely repetitive, but the sight of Kevin James doing all his stunts is good for a sporadic laugh. Kevin James has a certain level of charm about him when it comes to line delivery and a massive load of physical energy which he empties into Paul Blart: Mall Cop 2 without remorse, so his leading effort should appeal to his fans on some level.\nThere aren't really any other cast members that end up making much of an impact though. I didn't really expect many to make much of a difference, but the presence of Gary Valentine was something I hoped would be bring more laughter into it. When there was ultimately nothing funny about him being in the film, I'll admit to being disappointed. \n\nSo Paul Blart: Mall Cop 2 is precisely as ludicrous and derivative as you would expect, but its overtly ridiculous nature and the energetic leading effort of Kevin James manages to keep a sense of consistent energy in the sporadic laughs of the film.",

Paul Blart: Mall Cop 2 is an abomination of fart jokes, clumsy writing and a cheesy plot. The whole movie is a joke. It was created so that our favourite mall hero, Paul Blart's 'Epic Saga\" could be continued. I enjoyed the first movie, better than that knock off Seth Rogen comedy, Observe and Report. See, Mall Cop 1, was not only funny, but it was more appealing to a wider audience, it was clean, and proved to us that comedies don't need swearing to make their point clear, example: Observe and Report. The sequel just kills my love for Kevin James and Paul Blart. Blart has lost his charm over the years, and boy, it shows, CRYSTAL CLEAR. So yeah, it's terrible, ignore it at all costs, make sure your kids don't force you either. Mall Cop 2 is like a really bad Kevin James movie, add that to a really stinky sock and add a stupid motor scooter to it, equals to a sequel. In about another 6 years, Blart will be back, but this time in a MENTAL WARD. That should have been the location where Director Andy Fickman should have gone when making this movie. Kevin James lost even the 1.2 % of respect I had for him, he is a goddamn president in Pixels! Pixels looks appealing, but it can be ruined, HINT: Adam Sandler and Kevin James together.

That's not to say obnoxious can't be funny, but \"Paul Blart: Mall Cop 2\" is the perfect example of why it most often isn't.\r It all seems cheaply made so the larger scale and the settings don't look all that great.

One or two stupid one-liners got a slight chuckle from me, but overall the movie isn't even amusing. It relies way too much on dumb humor and repeating the same, unfunny \"fat person moves in goofy ways\" joke over and over again. If you are looking for laughs then look elsewhere.\r As a matter of fact no matter what you are looking for you should look elsewhere. \"Mall Cop 2\" might not be the utter abomination so many would like you to believe, but it's still a bad movie. One that's almost completely devoid of laughs and charm. It is strangely watchable in a mindless sort of way, but if you aren't laughing then what's the point? This is a comedy after all.\r I give \"Paul Blart: Mall Cop 2\" a 4.5/10.",

Okay, fine, the first part was decent. I thought a little refresher, somewhat funny too, so on such scenario, anticipating a sequel is common, but this is not what I wanted. After seeing this, I come to realise that the sequel was a bad idea. Seems funny, but no impact. In fact a little boring to see the same old comedy tricks again. Especially mocking a fat man is too offensive at the present era. So the hashtag on body shaming would go viral on social media.They did not get a decent story. Even the film characters, including the villains were too old fashioned. Even this film had made in the 90s, might have not received well too. The concept of going vacation-come-convention, we had seen this before, are not we! Yeah, Paul after his short marriage and losing mother, he and his daughter heads to Las Vegas. Being watchful father and meeting his old friends, the adventure begins, when some criminal activity is going on behind the conference. His plan to save his daughter, as well as thwart the crime are the remaining focus of the film.I felt for a character like Paul Blart, casting Raini Rodriguez as his daughter was a little too much intentional. Yeah, the film was full of television guys every corner. Its not just direction, or performance failed, it was the writing. This kind of comedies is now considered ancient, that's why Rowan Atkinson stopped doing his routine comedies. But now it's certain that there won't be a third. If you had seen the first and not sure about this, believe me, you won't miss anything. Instead, I would suggest you to re-watch the original.

Unfortunately we get another one with Happy Madison Studios making the not-so-likable character Paul Blart in his sequel \"Mall Cop 2\".   Kevin James plays in the title role yet again as one of  New Jersey's well known mall cops this time he is more annoying and obnoxious than ever. I don't think I have sat through a movie looking at a character more annoying than any of the other bad characters I have seen in other bad movies. Actor Kevin James has spoken out about liking this character (for whatever reason) and had the idea of making a sequel.\r The movie begins with Paul Blart, who had just got married and started to have a new life; that is until his wife divorces him after six days of marriage. This is ridiculous as it sounds but it gets more distressing after only five minutes in. Paul's mother goes out for a newspaper, and then is randomly run over by a milk truck. It suddenly goes from sad to dark just minutes apart. After Paul's mother randomly dies. his daughter gets accepted into UCLA, but she does not want to tell her father because she thinks it will hurt his feelings. They then take a trip to Las Vegas, Nevada to go on vacation.\r Then the problems go on from there. There are so many gags and offensive jokes through out the entire movie. For example, the Segway that Paul shows off to two lousy men later in the movie is only there to extend the movie's duration time in order to get to the ninety minute mark. There are countless amount of these scenes in the movie that it makes the film boring instead of reaching its goal to be funny.\r Speaking of which, where is the comedy in this movie? None of the jokes are original and don't make any sense. I waited patiently for ninety minutes waiting for a funny moment to happen, but it never came. There are times where the movie adds in a random scene to make the movie look more ridiculous and redundant. There is one particular scene where Paul Blart attacks an African Crane, this scene tries to make Paul look like a funny guy, but really, he is being a jerk and shows that he is very easy to annoy.\r This isn't Happy Madison Studios' first film to have a sequel worse than its predecessor, Grown Ups 2, Joe Dirt 2 are both examples of bad films that the Studio should listen to the criticism in order to make their film better.\r \"Criticism is a lesson\"- 30 Cents.",

            "content": "This review contains spoilers, click expand to view.\n        \nWant to scream bloody murder? Then the new Halloween is the trick-or-treat frightfest for you. But, first, a leap of faith is required. You have to forget that there are already nine sequels and remakes of John Carpenter\u2019s 1978 original \u2014 thankfully, director David Gordon Green and coscreenwriters Danny McBride and Jeff Fradley pretend those lame copies never existed (no loss there). To them, Halloween 2018 is the first sequel ever to Carpenter\u2019s horror classic. It\u2019s been 40 years since babysitter Laurie Strode (Jamie Lee Curtis) got rocked by PTSD when the masked killer Michael Myers rampaged through the leafy streets of her hometown of Haddonfield, Illinois. And in the years since, the Final Girl has turned herself into Bloody Grandma, a rabid survivalist who\u2019s booby-trapped her house and stayed rifle-ready until the day Michael \u2014 the essence of pure evil \u2014 breaks out of his loonybin and comes for her. That day is here. And, yup, it\u2019s Halloween.Just watching Curtis dig into the role of this former-babysitter-turned-hardcore-avenger will keep you on the edge of your seat. She\u2019s a marvel of ferocity and feeling. Laurie knows that her Michael obsession has lost her custody of her now-adult daughter Karen (Judy Greer), trained in combat since childhood, and caused a rift with her granddaughter Allyson (Andi Matichak). But she\u2019ll live with it if her family can be safe. Playing the na\u00efve Laurie made Curtis a star at 19; now she brings a sense of loss, regret and separation to the role that deepens the character\u2019s humanity without diminishing her resolve. It\u2019s a savage roar of a performance that stays alert to nuance. And it fits in perfectly with Green\u2019s concept of the film as a feminist parable in which three women come together to call #TimesUp on a male predator.In other areas, the filmmaker must fight familiarity in a sometimes losing battle. Though he ups the violence quotient on Carpenter\u2019s film, Green\u2019s R-rated sequel comes after the torture-porn excess of the Saw and Hostel franchises that numbed us to gore. It also lacks the satiric bite of Get Out. This is a film made by Carpenter fans for other Carpenter fans. Green brought on the master, now 70, as advisor and to update his eerie synthesizer score with son Cody Carpenter and Daniel Davies. The credits ape the original\u2019s right down to the serif font, and cinematographer Michael Simmonds indulges in those long, suspenseful tracking shots that take Myers\u2019 point of view. The first actor to play the horror-flick icon, Nick Castle, joins forces with James Jude Courtney, to embody the older but still death-fixated man-in-the-mask. And yes, that William Shatner/Star Trek mask painted white is very much present and accounted for. So what\u2019s new? Not much according to the plot, which more or less follows the same trajectory as the original. The first Halloween\u2018s Dr. Loomis, played by the late Donald Pleasance, has been replaced by the equally obsessive Dr. Sartain (Haluk Bilginer). The shrink wants to know why Michael kills. For a with-it touch, two Brit podcasters (Rhian Rees and Jefferson Hall) have been added to the equation to retell the homicidal maniac\u2019s story for the uninitiated. They are also around to provide fresh meat before Michael goes into slaughter mode on the babysitter beat.All things end, as they must, with the Strode women taking on Michael in the woods. Halloween started as a slasher movie done with an inventive talent for the game by Carpenter. That Green\u2019s sequel works as well as it does \u2014 it\u2019s still a slasher movie \u2014 is due only in part to the director and his collaborators\u2019 copycat admiration for Carpenter\u2019s blueprint. Mostly it\u2019s the troubled times we live in that allows this energizing, elemental horror film to touch a raw nerve for #MeToo. We watch a woman call a male monster to account for her own lasting trauma. That\u2019s too real to laugh off as Hollywood make-believe. We\u2019re living it.",
