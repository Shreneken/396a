            "content": "I actually enjoyed Supergirl a lot more than I expected and that's mainly because of Melissa Benoist. She's the perfect Supergirl. Besides being beautiful, she's a terrific actress. I hope that they find a way to bring her into the DCEU or even on Superman and Lois. I know James Gunn took over and is starting from scratch but you're not going to find a better Supergirl. The rest of the cast is very good too, they all made the show entertaining for a lot longer than it should've been. Like most shows that stick around long enough the show did start to dip in quality a little in the later seasons so even though it was the right time for the show to end I'm still going to miss it.",

            "content": "Supergirl isn't the best superhero show available but I have to admit that I enjoy it more than I thought I would and that's mainly because Melissa Benoist is just about perfect as Supergirl. I love most Superhero movies and TV Shows so I thought I'd give this a chance and I'm glad I did because I really do enjoy it. It's not great by any means but it's also not as bad as some others here say either. I like most of the CW DC shows (Arrow, The Flash, Supergirl, Legends of Tomorrow, Stargirl, etc. The only one I don't like is Black Lightening) and while this isn't my favorite I still enjoy it. Even though it was probably the right time to end this show and the last season was the weakest, it still went out in a high note. I'm going to miss seeing Melissa Benoist every week.",

            "content": "At 12 years old, Kara Zor-El escapes doom on planet Krypton to find protection on Earth with the Danver family, where she grows up in the shadow of her foster sister, Alex, and learns to hide the extraordinary powers she shares with her cousin, Superman. Now an adult living in National City and working for media mogul Cat Grant, Kara finds her days of keeping her abilities a secret are over when super-secret agency head Hank Henshaw enlists her to help protect the city's citizens from threats. Finally coming into her own, Kara must juggle her new responsibilities with her very human relationships.Now I can only talk about what I have seen of the show I have only watched the first 2 seasons of the show and I don't plan on watching the rest since I don't have time to watch all of the arrowverse but from what I've seen I got to say it's a good show. It really focuses on how Supergirl is still learning her powers and it also focusses a lot that she is nothing like her more famous cousin. If you are a big superhero nerd like me than you will also love all the small references and the characters that appear throughout this show. The characters are lovable and likeable and you absolutely hate the villains they really make their presents known to you. It manages to balance out the humour with the story they are trying to tell. And I like that the show isn't alway Focused on the main bad guy there is always a smaller villain that comes in during one episode that they need to stop before going on to stop the big bad guy. The CGI is not the best you can really tell how bad it is so I hope they fix that.Overall it's a good show to watch every now and again you will especially like it if you are a Dc fan.",

            "content": "Season 1 was quite good and held well to the superhero genre. Season 2 started well but drifted deeply into interpersonal drama. Season 3 started the way season 2 ended, with less emphasis on the superhero and deeply into character emotions/relationships and social issues. These are important discussions, to be sure, but I watch superhero shows to see action and fun, not for deep emotion or for a critical societal expos\u00e9.Frankly I don't care who's straight, gay, engaged, in love, depressed, happy or psychotic unless it directly relates to the villain:heroine story line. Supergirl has, seemingly, fallen to influences (pressures?) far from the original comic book universe. It has become a soap opera.",

They are GOD AWFUL and dated by 2003 standards. Comparing the CGI in LOTR to this honestly makes me cry in pain. I won't get into the politics either because it honestly doesn't need to be mentioned.

Anyways, if you wanna watch Supergirl expecting a really great TV show don't do it, it lacks of a lot of things, but if you wanna just entertain watching something then watch Supergirl, it's fun to watch.",

            "content": "In elementary school, part of our creative writing class was to SHOW, not tell.It seems Supergirl's writers can't meet the standards of an elementary school writing class.As a woman, I'm not just profoundly disappointed in this show, I'm deeply embarrassed. This IS why men don't take women seriously. Finally, there's a super hero TV show with a female lead...and it's just so bad.It's like in Whisky Tango Foxtrot when the first woman to drive a car, crashes it.It sucks for women everywhere.Wonder Woman was good, because she DEMONSTRATED she could handle herself. Her being a woman was only mentioned, because of the era the movie took place in.If this show had a male lead, people still wouldn't like it. It really is just poorly done. Oliver Queen fights with strong women all the time and their gender isn't brought up once. Even Felicity is more badass and she sits behind a screen most of the time. I enjoy Arrow much more because of this. Supergirl feels very whiny and preachy.Men are people too. Feminism shouldn't be about taking men down a notch or being better than men. It should just be about raising women up to the same level as men. Not all men are physically stronger than women and not all women are physically stronger than men. Ronda Rousey is stronger than Michael Cera, but John Cena is stronger than Ronda Rousey. You can't paint an entire gender with a single brush. Some men will be smarter and stronger than some women. Some women will be smarter and stronger than some men. There is a difference between fairness and equality.I wish the show focused more on SHOWING Supergirl's competency than it did on finger wagging at men and telling everyone how great she is. I couldn't believe in the first season there's this huge build up to a city wide crisis, they're completely out of options, they've tried everything, they've thought of everything, and then all of the sudden all their problems are solved because of HOPE and believing in people. Supergirl's hope was so strong it overpowered the enemy that Superman couldn't beat. I nearly sprained my eye sockets from rolling my eyes so hard. I repeat: THIS is why women aren't taken seriously.Why can't she just fight crime and save the day like the rest of them? Why turn it into a political Trojan horse? If I wanted politics, I'd watch C-SPAN. I half expect Supergirl to whip out a talking stick most of the time.",

            "review_title": "Worst of the DC bunch, for now",
            "content": "Review of Season One:I've been watching a few of these modern-day DC comic book TV shows and have mildly enjoyed the likes of ARROW and THE FLASH. Sadly, SUPERGIRL proves to be the weakest of the bunch, an annoyingly lightweight show that takes a childish approach to the material. The main character is presented as an airhead version of her cousin Superman, and the actress playing her, Melissa Benoist, has real trouble convincing in the part. Her voice often sounds weak and whiny and wavers whenever she's required to put drama or emotion into the role. Not that the rest of the show is much better. The \"serious\" stuff feels like warmed-up left-overs from better shows and films, with the usual villain-of-the-week attacks and greater alien conspiracies. The office \"comedy\" stuff with a miscast Calista Flockhart is even worse, an excruciating rip-off of the whole DEVIL WEARS PRADA set-up. The CGI effects are quite poor and the action choreography fails to make any impact whatsoever. I'm only watching this because it happens to be on TV, but I wouldn't dream of paying for the \"pleasure\".Review of Season Two:Unfortunately the second season of the show is no better, and in many respects even worse. Expect heavy-handed criticism of the Trump leadership alongside the usual boring character relationship drama and guest villains. Teri Hatcher shows up as the one of the main adversaries but gives an embarrassingly hammy performance while the CGI effects remain nothing to write home about. The strength of TV shows lies in the writing and with this one it's nothing special at all despite all the effort having gone into it.Review of Season Three:The third season is the worst yet and continues the slide into oblivion. The so-called dramatic plot elements are anything but, the villains are cheesy beyond belief, and the emphasis is on the characters and the relationships between them. This leads to endless soap opera-style plotting, seemingly everybody becoming some kind of hero in their own right, and repetitive-feeling scripting. It's trite and uninteresting, and a crushing disappointment to boot.",

All of this together seems like a parody, that's roughly what today's film production looks like today. The dialogues are hilariously bad and forced, simply unwatchable.I managed to watch a few episodes and concluded that I shouldn't waste time on something so insignificant. Writers are interested in some other things here, instead of providing the viewer with an escape from reality and good entertainment. As usual today, quantity is more important here than quality.Just another example of a poorly written show. There is simply no point in wasting time on this disaster.",

After season 2, I feel like the show went on a really fast downward spiral until it felt really bad. That combined with the fact that once season 4 started, the CW decided that since Superman and Supergirl were basically like the personification of the American way, every single episode had to have a political message behind it made it pretty much unwatchable after a while. Also, the writing is some of the worst out of the three CW shows I've watched, The Flash, Legends of Tomorrow, and Supergirl.",

            "content": "I went into this series hoping that it would be another Smallville or something similar but was pretty disappointed with season 1. It did seem like there was potential so I decided to give season 2 a try and have been more and more disappointed with each episode I watch.My biggest problem is Supergirl's attitude. She behaves like a spoiled, self-entitled, super arrogant, super bitchy - dick. As Jimmy and Wynn set up for Guardian she knocks them down every chance she has and refuses to let someone else do what they want. She behaves like this with Mon-El and pretty much everyone else. This goes on and on throughout all of season two (up to episode 14 so far).The fights are really badly edited. There are so many instances where you see the punch or kick fly by the opponent and missing them by a good foot (f not more) and that takes you out of the moment. It looks more like they were filming the rehearsals rather than the actual sequences. Some fights are just unbareable to watch because of that. It's a shame because the stunts and fights for the most part are well done so it's a shame to ruin good work by poorly placed cameras and bad editing.Supergirl is an idiot. Over and over again she knocks down the bad guy, then turns around for whatever reason and just stands there. Meanwhile the bad guy gets up and kicks her ass. Happens over and over. Just not believable and it makes the character seem like they're pretty incompetent and shouldn't be fighting in the first place. For being someone that has super speed she sure can let herself get her ass kicked left, right and center by just regular humans with the odd gadget. Plot line in season two is almost non existent. There's a vague story arch going on in the background but the episodes are filled with melodrama and bad acting. Please, tell me for the next 5 minutes why your feelings are hurt, why I disappointed you, why you don't like me, etc, etc. This should be called - Supergirl - The soap opera.My last point which made me say OK, I'm not watching this anymore was episode 14 of season two. Apart from almost nothing going on (the plot line/story could have been advanced in less than 5 minutes, the rest was fluffer). Kara and Alex get their father back (was rescued) who has been working for Cadmus for 14 years, they reinstate him in the DEO with full access and no questions asked? WHAT?? Common, what sort of morons write sh*t like this? The season is full of moments like this where you just scratch your head and say \"UH, WTF?!\" I will say that the acting has gotten better over time. Somewhat normal I'd say for the actors to take some time to fall into their roles but that's definitely not enough to save the series. Final thoughts - don't waste your time unless you like Days of Our Lives and enjoy seeing the plot/storyline advance about as fast as a daytime soap opera and also enjoy all the melodrama that comes with it. In order for this show to survive you'd have to get a whole new writing crew in and reinvent the show. Not impossible but is it going to happen? Likely not. No wonder it has a low rating.",

It's family-friendly and PC in every possible way (to the point of shoving it down our throats) and it's actually a lot of fun... sometimes. In between the cheesy dialogue and grating pop singles, there are some very cool moments in Supergirl. There's a potentially great antihero in Maxwell Lord, a promising cast altogether, oh, and J'onn freakin' J'onzz - far and away the best thing about the show. There is clever dialogue sprinkled around and a few character beats do pay off in the finale, but the best episodes are the oddballs. The White Martian versus The Green Martian, The Flash crossover (I do hope they do more because their chemistry was phenomenal), creepy freak-of-the-weeks like Toyman, threatening villains like Non - that's the kind of badass comic book hero stuff I want to see. Not awkward banter between a love triangle (or rectangle) or them degrading Superman in every possible respect (it's funny when they instant message but literally every other reference to Clark puts him in a negative light).It's a show with potential, and if it is to continue, some things need to go. Tone down the overtly PC writing, get rid of the pop songs, give the effects department a bigger budget, overall more action, less talking, and this could be a winner.

            "content": "UPDATE:\nSo as Season 6 plods along, the audience numbers continue to plummet. Nielsen ratings show Season 6 to have the lowest ratings so far, mostly in the few hundred of thousands. That's a death knell for a broadcast show. So what went wrong?The comments on this board sum it up. The show got too \"preachy\" and forgot it was a superhero comic book show. It also forced its political agenda on viewers, some of whom probably agree with these sentiments, but also served to alienate others. And in the end, the show just wasn't well-written any more. You could even see how the producers were trying to save money by limiting expenses, like CGI and special effects.So Supergirl will fly off television, but will always be available somewhere as streaming content (nothing REALLY ever leaves TV anymore). Here's hoping the producers of the big-screen Supergirl character in future DC films do not make the same mistakes this show has made.++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++\nPREVIOUS:\nI have watched Supergirl since its inception, when it started on CBS. It started out as a promising new series (with some forgivable poor casting choices, notably Calista Flockhart). But once the show relocated to the CW, and moved to Canada to save production costs, things seem to have gone downhill.Many of Greg Berlanti's shows have a formula, that principally includes \"teams\" - Team Flash, Team Arrow, even \"Team Supergirl\" (counting the DEO). That automatically reduces the reliance on the central character. The team approach exceeds \"suspension of disbelief\" with such items as Winn being the DEO's \"Wesley Crusher\" (and apparently the smartest computer whiz on the planet), but also someone that can assemble super-suits together. And James (not Jimmy) Olsen, who instead of being a young, inexperienced geeky kid is now the COO of a worldwide media corporation (and a buff adult too). This gets harder to buy every week.There are also some ridiculous creative choices by Mr. Berlanti. Brainiac now looks more like a cute member of a blue boy band, not the super villain he was supposed to be. And Mr. Mxyzptlk as a suave British suitor for Kara? Really?!? Even the addition of Superman doesn't look so, sorry, \"super\".Then there's the title character of Kara. Instead of growing and becoming a better hero, she seems to devolve into self-pity and \"no one can understand what I go through\". Mellisa Benoist is a likable enough actress - don't make her a spoiled child. If she is going to take on something called a \"world killer\", don't you think her cousin might want to help too?There are too many obvious cost-cutting measures in the post-CBS productions. In each 44-minute episode (1 hour minus commercials), at least half that time is spent talking about the feelings of some secondary character. That means less flying, less fighting, and less CGI production expenses.So what does work? It was a nice touch when Kara would text Clark for advice and communication. But that hasn't been seen in a long time. Also, Kara needs to be allowed to mature as both a hero and a person (which has not happened yet). The crossovers between Berlanti's universe have been kind of interesting, especially with Flash/Supergirl storylines. But that can get tired really, really fast if they are not careful.Post-CBS, the series has been on the downslide and may continue if cost savings are the principle concern.++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++",

Now we zoom into the future, regardless of his color, suddenly Jimmy Olsen turns into a physically cut confident manly man that insists on being called James. This is just too big of departure from the roots of the story. Making characters another race is expected in this age of TV diversity, but you need to keep their essence. They didn't and ruined the story for me. I can't take this adaptation serious.... Jimmy Olsen is a geek and us comic fans are geeks, he is one of our own, not a cut gym rat.

Brooks is far too long in the tooth and far too worldly to play the Ultimate sidekick. Also annoyingly miscast is David Harewood as Hank Henshaw.

She pouts her way through every scene -- so horribly BAD you want to run screaming from the room. Flockhart is not strong enough as an Actor to pull off this role. She lacks the personal gravitas to be a convincing Leader. I would send her immediately off to the Phantom Zone.Melissa Benoist lacks the charisma to play a Super Hero. Her scenes with Jeremy Jordan are totally lacking in any chemistry. This Turkey should be done by Thanksgiving....",

It sort of reminds me of years ago when I went to see a multi-racial version of \"A Streetcar Named Desire.\" They made Stanley Black in it but didn't change the racist slurs to match the fact that he clearly wasn't Polish in this adaptation. Wouldn't have been so bad if they had changed the P-Word to the N-word to make the classic script match the character.With Jimmy Olson race doesn't matter that much. The character can be Black and it doesn't really change who he is...He can't, however, be a wise adult that does NOT bumble through life in an effort to get a decent pic of Superman......Even if that Superman is Supergirl...that sort makes you wonder \"why name the character James Olson?\" if you are not going to make him young comic relief you can name him anything you want, because it's not Jimmy Olson. It's just some character whose name you stole and rebooted until he wasn't the young schmuck we all know and love....And in that case, it wouldn't have been so bad if he was old and, you know, still Jimmy Olson. Instead we have the reason why people hate reboots.And of course there is the plot. Joss Whedon does a really good job of writing strong female characters that can go through romantic emotional dramas and still feel like strong female characters. It's one reason nerds like me loved Buffy so much, she could be super tough and still super feminine.Ali Adler doesn't really know how to pull it off with the same grace and, well, it makes Supergirl feel less like Girl Power and more like 90210. Who will she date? Will she find love? It makes the discussions of \"Supergirl\" v \"Superwoman\" in the show seem forced that is the only real female empowering part of the film and the rest is a crude reflection of Chuck Austen's infamous run on the X-Men...Then again, I'm only starting out, the series is only starting out...who knows, they might get a clue and change the series from the dating game to something more...empowering for women.",

The mixed race relationships (have you read the news lately, they aren't the most successful in real life) could be tolerated, as well as the 'we are women, hear us roar' sexism. But the blatantly open lesbianism has but one goal IMO, to get girls experimenting in lesbianism at an early age.I have watched all 3 seasons so my opinion is based on the entire series and not just the first few episodes.

Due to the fact that Krypton was dying, Kal El (Superman), and Kara Zor-El, were sent away to Earth where they could thrive and survive. Though both were sent so they could live, Kara was also sent to protect Kal-El; however, just as her pod was leaving Krypton's atmosphere, the planet exploded and the shockwave sent her pod off course into the Phantom Zone, a prison dimension used by Kryptonians. This prison dimension was originally discovered by Jor El, Kal El's father, and used by the Kryptonian Council as a humane prison. Although the zone is a barren wasteland, people trapped in the zone cannot grow old or die. As a result of being trapped in the Phantom Zone, Kara arrived at planet Earth several decades later only to discover that her cousin, Kal El, whom she was supposed to protect, was a full grown adult called Superman. After being adopted by the Danvers family, Kara slowly follows into the footsteps of her younger cousin as both a journalist and a Superhero known to the world as Supergirl.Unlike other DC television series that have a darker and violent atmosphere that might be unappealing to some, \"Supergirl\" is a cheerful, action packed series that is both entertaining and amusing. That being said, it would have been nice if Supergirl's look were a little more modernized to match her appearance in the NEW 52. Although there are a few cheesy moments, Kara's innocent, energetic, quirky, playful personality makes \"Supergirl\" enjoyable to watch. In the end, \"Supergirl\" is a fun and interesting series that has excellent potential. That being said, the acting needs some improvement as the cheesiness of the show can sometimes come across as fake, or amateurous. Additionally, the writers as well as the researchers need to get there facts straight as a native citizen of the planet Krypton is a Kryptonian and not a \"Kryptoniese\". As for those of you disliking it from just the pilot episode, you should examine/recognize this shows potential as there are a lot of amazing TV shows that had a rocky start.",

We used to love watching Supergirl with our daughter, but we quit watching in season 2 due to the drastic change in the nature of the show.Don't take it from me, look at what CinemaBlend has to say. \"The Season 3 premiere was watched by 1.86 million viewers and scored a disappointing 0.5 rating in the key 18-49 age demographic in Live+Same day calculations, making it the lowest-rated show in its time slot. In fact, the only Monday night show that performed with lower numbers was The CW's new series Valor, which only won a 0.3 rating and 1.21 million viewers.

I watched as Suppergirl just stood by and watched a switch thrown in this last episode, the one used to activate the killing weapon. Just stood there as if she couldn't move. This is just bad writing, you writers. Super- speed, get it? She could have been there before that switch was thrown easily. Think of how the Kryptonians moved in \"Man of Steel,\" or \"Smallville.\" That's how Supergirl should move. Her reflexes match that. It's almost impossible to take any Earth-resident Kryptonian by surprise. So get with it. There are other plot devices which would be infinitely more interesting if writers just dealt with the character's powers instead of hobbling her this way. And, yes, this is written immaturely and unprofessionally. You don't have to write down to kids in the audience.

What I wrote below in 2019 is still valid but the show has gone so far off track that it holds no more interest for me.(from 2019): My early life, way back in the 1950s and 1960s, involved reading comic books. Like many kids of that time the \"super\" heroes were my favorites. Superman, Superboy, Supergirl. I have always been a fan, always enjoyed immersing myself into that fantasy world. A good diversion from just homework.With that as my background I was eager to see what they would do with this new TV series. I have seen the 1984 \"Supergirl\" movie, in fact I own the DVD and re-watched it recently. Plus I was familiar with Benoist from her being a cast member of the TV series \"Glee\".I was very happy with the first couple of seasons. There was good focus on Supergirl and how she could save people in emergencies and fight crime. Thern work as a reporter in her Kara persona. Most episodes were just very interesting light weekday evening entertainment in fantasy stories.However last season and so far this 2019 season the episodes have become much less interesting, with the increased focus on \"relationships.\" That's the stuff for soap operas, not for good superhero shows. As a result I am less and less eager to watch and will likely drop it altogether. I suppose it is hard to remain creative in writing new episodes.Still, Melissa Benoist is good as the main character, Kara, who as a 12-yr- old was sent towards Earth just after her baby cousin Kal-El with instructions to look after him. But she was sidetracked, the explosion of Krypton sent her into a phantom zone where she stayed for 24 years, and not aging. So when she finally reached Earth she was adopted by the Danvers family (played by former Superman Dean Cain and former Supergirl Helen Slater) still at age 12, but not needing to protect her cousin who was then in his 20s.It was a good series while the interest lasted, now mostly just filler time.

I don't care for any of the characters this season. Where is the character development for Kelly, Nia, and most importantly Alex? J'onn is phoning it in, William is there contributing nothing and could easily be removed from the season and whatever plot there is would continue as if nothing is missing. Lena who is supposed to have a huge impact is stuck in a lab or following her brother around. Where is the strong character we've seen in seasons past. Kara is especially weak, anyone can beat her in a fight. She's the strongest person on earth and also a genius but she's always losing and never uses her powers. Super hearing, super speed, super strength nah she has none of it. Romance ? Don't worry somebody will be there to tell Kara she likes someone, even if she visibly cringes near that person.

They clearly know what they're doing, what with Arrow, Flash and iZombie. CBS already failed with the 1990 version of the Flash, and if they don't do something they're going to kill Supergirl before the show gets a chance to get off the ground.The pilot is cheesy, and ya there are plenty of screw ups, but the overall feel for the show is good. Again, just give the show some time. It may get better, it may get worse. The only way to find out is to watch and hope for the best. The best thing in the series for me is Melissa Benoist.I know this is a rare female lead in a superhero show; but does female empowerment need to be referenced continually?

And that was what should have happened, since most of the other episodes just felt like a waste of time. The remaining episodes are just Cat thinks Kara is Supergirl, Kara has nothing to wear, Kara becomes mischievous because she got exposed to fake kryptonite (because apparently they learnt nothing from Superman III), Kara loses her powers (another story lifted from Superman), Winn has daddy issues and (wait for it...) Max Lord has Cat's emails.The cinematography, dialogues and acting are so laughable. Most of the time the fights always go like - \"Please, stop! You don't want to do this...\" \"You know nothing about me!\". Everyone is so ignorant. All the conflict simply comes because people are keeping secrets with each other. General Lane doesn't trust Martian Manhunter just because he's an alien, although they can trust Kara for the same reason.Trust me, the only reason why I'm watching Supergirl is so that I can watch The Flash season 3.

The problem is that she says Superman is already on earth. But it seems like Superman is lazy. By that I mean, Superman in the movies and comic books takes care of worldwide threats. However, on this show when a worldwide threat occurs. He lets his less than amazing cousin handle it. Superman is my favorite superhero, but I hate the way they made him.Here's another problem. The dialogue. It's cringeworthy as well. For example: Remember when Alex said: \"You know what other species also have? Those?\" She literally kicked an alien in the balls with that one-liner. That scene makes the scene on MIB II with the Ballchinnian look excellent. God, there's still more stuff I have to say.Let's talk about Alex. Yeah, I'm not ranting against LGBT fans out there. But there's an obvious inconsistency with her character. She is obviously into boys when she's young. Then all of a sudden, she claims she's homosexual and always has been? WHAAT? Where did this sudden change come from? Don't make her claim to be homosexual all along, but have her interested in boys when she's young. That's just bad script writing.Next let's talk about the symbol. Remember when Christopher Reeve would always rip his shirt open to reveal his symbol? It was iconic and you felt great when he did it because you felt that Superman was here. On this show, Supergirl does the same, but she actively shoves her symbol in your face like she's trying to make you eat it. We get it, you're Supergirl. But the symbol thing isn't that iconic for you, also, don't keep shoving it in our faces. That makes people hate it and prefer Batman's symbol.I'm sorry I can't type her name right, but Clissta Flockhart I think, looks a lot like Cat Grant from the comics, even if she is a little bit older. So that's okay, but the show constantly thinks that what happened back then on various media with Superman will work on this show.Like Supergirl turning evil and shooting peanuts at a bar, like Superman in Superman III. (I like Superman III, but they are ruining the movie for me!!!)Remember Non? Yeah, he's the intelligent guy on this show, and he's married to a woman named Astra? Whose general and supposedly Kara's aunt? WHAT? Another thing that ticked me off is them claiming that Zod is Superman's archenemy. Uh, Lex Luthor is you dummies!The fight scenes on here are pretty bad, you can obviously tell the actors are on strings when they are not CGI. Also, Martian Manhunter is a jerk on this show, When he figures out that Meghan I think her name is was a white Martian, he attacks her instead of just talking to her. Whose the real villain here?Remember how I said that they don't convey the comics well? Well, when the real Hank Henshaw said \"I AM CYBORG SUPERMAN!\" He isn't. He doesn't look anything like Cyborg Superman. Cyborg Superman looked like a robot version of Superman. This version just looks like Cyborg.Okay, I think I'll end this review for now. I still have a lot more that ticks me off. But I want my review to be on IMDB, and I don't want to turn this review into a straight out rant. So watch at your own risk. Because this show took away hours of my life that I can never get back.",

I am fine with any liberties taken with the source material.The problem is, very little thought seems to have been put into this series. When she decides to be a hero, she tells the guy who has a crush on her? And he happens to be good at designing superhero costumes even though he's just some flunky at a newspaper? Huh?The general with his suspicion of superheroes seems odd in a world where Superman is single-handedly saving the planet all the time. What's up with that?After almost getting killed by the bad guy, she goes back and fights a lot better. But why? She didn't train anymore. She didn't learn anything. Yes, she had a plan, but still, she was fighting a lot better, apparently because she realized how really, really important it was that she win, which she hadn't realized when she almost died the other time?Lazy plotting, lazy character design (nerdy guy, sexy guy, tough-chick CEO, yawn), and clearly very little respect for the audience's intelligence.

Melissa Benoist acquits herself well as Kara, the Kryptonian who now hides her identity as Superman's cousin while working as a gopher for Cat Grant (Calista Flockhart), the head of the Catco publishing empire. Kara is an enthusiastic, caring person who reminds me of an animated Disney character. In fact, the first half of the pilot rather feels like a modern Disney animated film, with the same rhythms.Then, in an obvious attempt to move the story along (faster than I would have liked), the writers take Kara's character through an arc that could have taken five or six episodes. The result is a rushed feeling that shortchanges the storyline. This show has some likable characters. It would have been nice if they had been developed more.Some viewers may disagree with the characterization of Jimmy Olsen. Instead of having the \"Gee whiz\" ineptness of the original character, this show's \"James Olsen\" (Mehcad Brooks) is tall, intelligent and suave, which serves the new storyline, where he has been sent to watch over Kara.Dean Cain (\"Superman\") and Helen Slater (\"Supergirl\") briefly appear--a nice touch.Hopefully, the various characters will get the depth they deserve in future episodes. Meanwhile, I think the superior acting of Benoist will keep people watching. I will update later, when the series hits its stride.Update 11/11/15: It did not take long for \"Supergirl\" to hit its stride. The \"How Does She Do It\" episode provided more story lines, developed the characters, and was full of clever, humorous references. Melissa Benoist is a joy to watch. It also redefined her relationship with Superman. I am upping my grade to \"8\".",

She let us feel Supergirl like she were real, really on our Earth, like we could call her when we're in dire need.Anyway, the entire cast is superb, from the first season till the 6th & last one, and while I would have enjoyed seeing more about some of them (Mon-El, Winn, Sam...), I was definitely pleased with later addition in the main cast (i.e. Lena, Brainy, Nia).I must say, however, that some episodes, dealing with controversial political and social issues, weren't necessary for the show: but it's good that they were just few and not far too much one-sided. And, of course, those issues didn't affect in a bad way the characters involved.Unfortunately we didn't have a 7th season, but I hope we're gonna see more about Supergirl!

Supergirl is not heroic and not someone to look up to or emulate. She constantly requires that everyone around her make enormous personal sacrifices on her behalf. She continually relies on the men in her life to do all of the smart stuff and hard work. She incessantly complains that everything in her life isn't handed to her on a silver platter even though she's SUPERGIRL and therefore deserves it. She doesn't want to earn people's respect, she believe she's entitled to it. She's a taker, not a giver. She falls to pieces at the drop of a hat. She repeatedly gives up when things don't go her way and everyone has to practically force her to go back to doing super things. She does not care much for the other people in her life. Even when she does help people, her motives are purely self aggrandizing. Her greatest ambition is to continue making coffee for someone who actually does want to make something of herself.The other characters are shallow and vapid. They're not people in their own right. It's almost as if they're marionettes dancing around Supergirl, their entire existence is solely for the purpose of...well, it would just look awkward if Supergirl was the only character in the show.Any normal mundane person is more heroic in their real life than Supergirl is in her own show. Look to Peggy Carter or Katniss Everdeen for your positive female role models. When life doesn't give them what they want, they don't rely on their male friends to make things better. They step up, take charge, not only make their own situation better, but make things better for everyone around them, especially the people who aren't able to do so for themselves.If it wasn't for her powers, Supergirl wouldn't even be buying coffee for her boss. She'd be an unemployed delinquent smoking pot all the time with absolutely no direction to her life as her friends and family desperately try in vain to get her life back on track.Teach your children to study and work hard. They should aspire to be doctors, nurses, engineers, scientists, teachers, mathematicians, artists, poets, writers, fire fighters, law enforcement, social workers, builders and countless other professions.

            "content": "Believe me... I wanted to like this series... I wanted a good Supergirl. I've even watched the entire first season so I can say in response to all those \"hang in there, it gets better\" reviews... For what? There is nothing coming that will make the show anything more then a sad rip off of better super man series. First off I'll get it out of the way right away, the writers are awful and this is best demonstrated by their constant misuse of Superman... It is clearly obvious that WB put limits on what they could do with him... and to be frank he'd be better absent then what they have done with him. Some of the stupidest writing is directly related to him. In the episode following up how she says she needs to learn to accept help from friends, they right him in saving her from certain death from a villain... her response? \"I can't have superman saving me every-time I'm in trouble\".. fine next time just die that's what was gonna happen. In the scene it happened we only get to see a blurred image of him as he saves her, then later him on their fake im service apologizing as Clark... The sad part was as bad as this scene was... this was his better cameo... as the next time was outright horrid writing, I'd say I'd expect better from a 12 year old fan writing fan-fiction then this episode delivered... Superman's in space doing something... stop right there... no further writing needed I could forgive this, but no they had to bring him back and get controlled by a mind control device for humans which effected him because he was on earth so long because that has ever been used in a story before... I could forgive it if I mean at this point he's here on earth controlled by the bad guys so a confrontation between superman and supergirl... but no they can't do that because they are so limited in what they can show of him, so instead she fights her earth sister who is wearing a super suit of some type and attacking her with a kryptonite katana. But another problem is the villains, a lot of them are lesser versions of other superman villains or female ones. Powergirl and Bizzaro were mixed into one, Indigo (feels rewritten to be Brainiac in this), red tornado (as a bad guy?!), Livewire, Banshee (My gosh laziness on the writing side for flash, Barry ends up fighting 2 different sonic screamers from different dimensions in one season!, not to mention multiple speedsters in 2 seasons) to name a few. Non and Astra are 2 \"original\" characters, and by original rip-offs of General Zod and Ursa (making them a couple doesn't make them any less a rip off). Fort Rozz is a rip off of phantom zone, no getting around that. Max Lords, who makes me laugh the most, his actor going on to comment how he is different from Lex Luthor. He is a billionaire scientist who has it out for an alien wearing an S and Cape and has some casual interest in a female relevant in their lives, I mean that's completely different from Lex (I mean look at that head of hair).This one might sound nit-picky and racist... but seriously its not about that, Samuel L Jackson is a great Nick Furry, Michael Clark Duncan as Kingpin was about the only good thing about daredevil the movie, but I have to say it, Mechad Brooks is the worst possible choice ever for Jimmy Olsen. Why? For one thing, he isn't nerdy at all, he's bald, he's too attractive for the character... I didn't even know he was Jimmy Olson til the 3rd episode I thought Winslow Scott Jr. was Jimmy as he looks the part of Jimmy Olson. It's one thing to rewrite an important character to the series, but this actually irritates me as it suggests DC no longer respects Jimmy as a character and think of him as a throw away character... you want to make him black... that's fine... but you have to have someone who fits Jimmy and not so you can create some weird love triangle involving Supergirl.But before I end I will give it credit where it is due... The Hank Henshaw turning out to be Martian Manhunter was an enjoyable twist. Cat Grant role initially annoyed me with them making her an important feminist stereotype, but she at least was a consistent character (more then can be said for Kara or Kara's sister). I now find that since the series is moving she isn't even going to be a recurring character. I was really hoping there would be more out of Dean Cain too, instead he's barely been in it.Ultimately I don't get any of it's praise it's got, its writing is rarely decent more often coming off as bad fan fiction. The fact that it now part of the Arrowverse continuum is saddest part of all this as it means she is relevant to Flash. It's really sad CW thought this was more valuable to save then Constantine.",

            "content": "The adventures of Superman's cousin in her own superhero career. Supergirl is the latest DC Comics adaptation from producers Greg Berlanti and Andrew Kreisberg. Taking a page from The Flash and Smallville before it, the series also seeks to establish via Kara's origin tale a deeper mythology and an excuse for Earth to be populated by various super-beings. Supergirl arrived late in the booklet of comic book super-heroine that emerged after Wonder Woman in 1941. Though in the 60s she was a supporting player in the Superman family of titles. Until getting her first dedicated series in 1972. She has seen some reboots, pushed by publishers to diversify themselves. Did you know there's now a female Thor? A female Hawkeye and Spider-Gwen? This introductory hour holds closely to that pair producer's formula for The Flash, elevating an adorable Glee cast (there Grant Gustin, here Melissa Benoist) to a costumed-icon status. I'm glad Supergirl exists and I really want it to succeed. It's more than fine with me if it never becomes more than a solid superhero genre show with a female lead - especially since that lead is fantastic. Although Melissa Benoist is not unknown (especially to Glee viewers - like me - who made it past season 3) she's one of those rare casting miracle. She nails the title role: handling very well her dual role, it creates hope for the show going forward. Perfect casting. Her performance embraces, internalises and sells the character's contradictions and paradoxes. Melissa makes Kara feels real, she wears the costume proudly and easily while embodying joy and complexity all at once. Moreover, Calista Flockhart as the central character media mogul boss, Cat Grant, gives the show a Devil Wears Prada vibe. The first super-heroic act is a plane rescue that vaguely echoes the original Christopher Reeve's Superman. As in that movie there's a scene of exultation in which Kara explores her powers after so many years trying to blend in and be normal. A central idea in Superman's origin is that he is super not because of his powers, but because of the character cultivated by his parent. Here we're introduced to the Danvers, scientists and former TV show Superman father Dean Cain. Knowingly engages gender issues, including about the representation of women in pop culture. It's something rare: a superhero series that isn't about a superman. Indeed, writers smartly fit Supergirl's origin story to a very current feminist theme: that women must overcome being socialised to say sorry, o put themselves second or to efface themselves. Rather delivers its message with an enthusiastic bluntness that hearkens back to its comic roots. The name \"Supergirl\" is ultimately explained, seeking to deflect any charges of sexism about the \"girl\" designation. The most meta scene comes when Cat Grant coins this name and defends it to Kara , who tries to argue that perhaps \"SuperWoman\" would be a more appropriate and respectful name. \"I'm a girl\" says Cat, \"and your boss and powerful and rich and hot and smart. So if you perceive \"Supergirl\" as anything less than excellent, isn't the real problem you?\". The argument she makes is debatable but worth having. Finally, Supergirl could be filling a shameful void after Buffy the Vampire Slayer and Veronica Mars. That needs to be followed by more contemporary properties such as (hopefully) the upcoming Netflix series, Marvel's Jessica Jones. In a field long dominated by men, Supergirl provides a superhero roe model for girls and young women while symbolising values anyone could admire. \"Can you believe it? A female hero. Nice for my daughter to have someone like that to look up to.\" Yes that is nice. Now we need more. Overall, finding the right star and building a credible pilot are big parts of the battle. Thanks to those strengths if the producers can sustain the playfulness and action without going overboard, there's reason to believe this \"girl\" can fly.",

I still think the best actor with the best look to ever portray Superman was the late Christopher Reeve.Anyhoo, with all the airing of previews of the pending \"Supergirl\" and the fact that I have like cute and funny actress, Calista Flockhart, ever since watching her on her TV series \"Ally McBeal\" by writer David Kelley, I was excited to make sure that I watch Supergirl because I am a big fan of the Superman series.The series is Not bad, but it could be a lot better. I am all for opening up doors for African American, Latino and Asian actors to portray all roles, but Mehcad Brooks does Not fit the role of Jimmy. The old saying of \"if it's not broke, don't fix it\". He is to old to play Jimmy. Jimmy should be a first year college student type. They could write a new role for Mecad to play.They should stick to the original story line, where only her earth parents and maybe one other person knows (her earth sister) who Supergirl really is. She should Not be telling her co-workers and this special government agency that her earth sister works for her identify. If she is going to tell two co-workers, she just as well tell her boss and the entire office staff.I like Calista (Mrs. Harrison Ford) as an actress, but it seems her or the writers are trying to make her character out to copycat the brilliant Meryl Streep role as the queen of mean from \"Devil Wears Prada\". Calista can't pull that off. Leave that type of role to brilliant actress, Meryl or Julia Roberts. The mean sarcastic boss does Not fit Calista at all.",

And the Original Supergirl was a treat when written well. After the Crisis on Infinite Earths DC killed off the original Kara which was sad. The New Supergirl wasn't bad. But anyways. The TV series Supergirl does a lot of things right and a lot of things wrong. First the Wrong. Kara was never intended to be sent to Earth to Protect her little cousin Kal-El. She was sent for the same Reason Her City Argo City was dying after being Exposed to Kryptonite. Argo city survived the death of Krypton. And lasted for about 20 years .When her Father sent her to Earth it was to save her. This being sent to protect Kal is so much hogwash and Kara being older is wrong too.Superman finds her and sets her up in the Midvale orphanage to be adopted. he didn't just hand her over to the Danvers.Supergirl was trained secretly by Superman to be his secret weapon in case anything happened to him. he later revealed her to the world when her training was complete and he felt she could handle it.Supergirl was always her own person. She never worked for the DEO Or any other Government agency same as Superman.I admit these are nitpicks but important ones for me like Kara having to share Jimmy Olsen with Superman . Supergirl knows Jimmy and are friends but that's the extent of it. Now here's what they got right.Somebody was paying attention to the Man Of Steel movie and showed Kara getting used to her powers and its painful scary and makes you feel alone. Kudos to who wrote that into the series .Supergirl was always a part of a bigger universe The Martian Manhunter is done superbly well making it a highlight of the show. His story is lifted from the comics and is faithful to the story of Jonn Jonzz.Supergirl is well written. but there are liberties taken with the original source mat\u00e9riel's . but that's understandable after all she's survived since 59 in one form or another.

Regardless of the role she acts the same way. Sometimes it's like watching Glee with a cape. Next issue is there is an army of Kryptonions in town and no sign of Superman to help resolve the situation, but you have acknowledge his presence. So for him not to show up is ridiculous. The Krypton army should have never been written in the show in the first place. I could have understand one here or there through out the season. I truly don't understand why the writing is so bad when you have the whole history of Supergirl already done in the comics. Is it really that hard to update the story that has already been told? I hope future seasons will start to show better writing.",

The cast stand-outs are pretty-much Melissa Benoist and Jeremy Jordan and on their shoulders and with better writing this show might have attained it's potential. Such a shame! Anyhoo, I find myself fast-forwarding through any of the scenes with Calista Flockhart, I think with good writing and direction she can do well, but her performance in this is so flat and idiosyncratic (In a NOT good way!) that it is just about unbearable for me. I can imagine very young viewers enjoying it greatly and perhaps if they changed the time- slot to early morning cartoon time it would sit more comfortably. You can have one or two actors with charm, but unless you bounce them around in interesting situations and with other interesting characters, it isn't enough to save a sinking show. I have wondered what it requires to be 'saved', perhaps the death of CF's character, increasing the relationship dynamics between the two charmers (Benoist and Jordan) also using the 'race against time' device a little more and with greater deftness - as she is indestructible so the drama must be milked out of the vulnerability of those around her. Perhaps it is they are trying to appeal to both an adult and an extremely young audience so they never put any real meat on the bones? A pretty tricky situation for this show I think... ALSO - whoever did the music should either be schooled hard or sacked! Sheesh! ADDITIONAL: Now the show has changed hands I have noticed some definite improvements so I will increase my star rating from 1 star ... also, every time they include Martian Manhunter the whole show lifts a few notches - the actor is just so darned likable as is the double-sided character he plays.

These thing are acceptable for a hero who doesn't have superpowers, like the Green Arrow. In fact I quite enjoyed that show. Side kicks were adding to the charm of Green Arrow but in the Supergirl, they make her look too powerless, hopeless, dumb etc.\nThe element of melodrama in it just kills this show. personal relationships, political correctness etc.\nOne last thing that kept irritating me is that the Supergirl keeps pleading in front of the villians to look \"inside\", \"something good inside\", \"I know its not you\" blah blah.

Truth be told, Wonder Woman was my true inspiration when I was younger. I could relate to her and admired her strength and courage. I felt like if she could do anything, so could I. Sure, I was just a kid, but that kind of thing is great for kids.With that said, I feel like this will bring up a new generation of superhero lovers. Everyone basically keeps saying this show is too tropey. But who started those tropes? The classics, of course. Superman, Batman, Wonder Woman. These were our go-to since comics existed. Supergirl was later created so that girls could have a feminine figure to admire as well.I feel like so many people are missing the point of this show because they think it's too silly, the writing is too immature, or the plot seems too on-the-nose. But look at it from a new perspective: Can parents see themselves watching this with their children? Arrow shows some rather steamy scenes when that sweet lovin' is going on. What are parents doing? \"No, sorry kids, can't watch this.\" But Kara is cute, dorky, and the Everygirl. She wants her boss to be more understanding, she wants to help people, and she always has an encouraging word to say. The most important thing -- she values her friends. What better lesson to teach your kids in a modern age? And for those who are kids at heart, it's still an enjoyable show. There's a great cast with lots of people we recognize (at least I recognize several). It reminds me of my youth and why I loved superheroes to begin with. She's a *clothed* feminine figure who isn't relying on the size of her chest or butt to show how capable she is. Wasn't that the biggest complaint of all scifi and fantasy? Now, anyone who remembers the classic Disney movie, Hercules, and loved it regardless of what age they are, I feel like that's the movie that best describes this show. I was young enough to appreciate it, and I've even re-watched it out of nostalgia a few times. The more I think of a dorky person who didn't know their own abilities, including that inner heroic capability, the more I see a parallel between that movie and Supergirl 2015. Both wanted to be more. Both wanted to find a purpose in life. Both found it by being a hero and saving others.For people who missed that 90s happy campy nature, I feel like this show brings it back, but without feeling like an entire \"camping\" trip. Having also seen Arrow, Flash, and Gotham, Supergirl show is worthy of all ages. I just believe people need to give Supergirl a chance. Like any show, it will find that \"groove\" and improve. We've barley even started.",

But here - where he had no problem \"jumping the shark\" by changing Jimmy Olsen into a suave black guy - any updates to the sexist Supergirl creation from the late 1950's was a big \"no no\".I feel the same with this show as I did with the \"Lego For Girls\" nonsense; Someone had the opinion that to generate a female audience for a superhero show; They needed to ignore 100% of the world and cater to the stereotype of a 12 year old gender whose marketing choices can be found in one pink isle at Toys R Us.There's good list of reasons to not like this show, but to put it in terms Bertalini can understand, \"It's the poor man's Superman.\" Just like with her original invention; A generic duplicate of a preexisting character ... but female! It borrows everything about Superman from the orphaned Kryptonian small-town life to the bad workplace disguise and her own version of Lex Luthor. There's nothing unique about Kara that makes her a good stand alone character. This is a show about a supporting character. It's sad ... but like most people I DO HAVE HOPE FOR OUR SUPERGIRL ... Sure. I hope the show cancels and this character moves over to the upcoming 'Legends Of Tomorrow'.",

Someone suggested that this is a show parents can watch with their children, and some of that is good. The fact that Kara's sister is gay, responsible and just coming out, can be instructive, so perhaps they're moving away from the poor scriptwriting of the first season.The writing is the downfall of the series. It's as though the screenwriters know only the most banal of clich\u00e9s: \"Lets do it!\" being the most annoying one. But also, the setup formula is too trite to tolerate: Supergirl meets villain - who attacks her, or others - and lands one (if that many) punches and that's it. The villain manages to knock her on her butt, and then, in the final minutes, she wins the battle. OK, that's bad enough. But for someone who fights villains, she has terrible reflexes (she turns away for a minute just because the villain is on the ground) and then he/she knocks her out. This is what makes it so annoying. Nobody has street smarts. If they were in a real war, as in Real Life, a soldier would make sure the enemy is completely incapacitated (or dead) before they turned away. Add to that, exploding cars (cars don't explode when they hit the ground, people. At least, not every time a car is tossed). It's a kiddie-based show. So if you like that, fine. Oh, and Myxzptlk was Superman's foe and was not 6' tall with dark wavy hair. Another pet peeve: everyone's young and cutesie. British TV is SO much more for adults, but then, it's CW. Very little on CW has an adult perspective. Just all PYTs (pretty young things - including the men). And that'll be enough for some people who want disposable entertainment. For the rest of you, If you want intelligent superhero TV, go watch old episodes of (Joss Whedon's) Buffy The Vampire Slayer TV series, with superb writing and much better actors.

She is a good actress, and is by far the main reason to watch the show. There isn't much one can watch these days with a young daughter, and this does present a mostly positive image. The problem are the writers. The extremist, regressive leftist ideology presented on the show is really bordering on the absurd. I get it that many in Hollywood think it is the greatest mission in life to propagandize for the normalization of same-sex relationships. It's tiresome, and needlessly heavy-handed, but not unexpected. What is absurd is the incorporation of current politics into the show. It was bad enough with the endless Hillary Clinton references, now the entire story line is about how bad it is that the US will be adopting a merit based immigration policy like every other country on earth. Every episode is about the poor immigrants and how everyone hates them. Then, we finally have mass deportations. Now, if the government was really engaging in these policies, maybe there would be a message. But it's not. Really, given how unpopular the Democratic Party is, it's time for everyone with propaganda power to take a step back. Rethink your message. The world is transitioning to a United Nations controlled monetary framework that demands immigration controls as currency exchange rates are determined by population growth. In 10 years, every country on earth will have the exact same immigration policy. It's time to move on.",

Supergirl is Superman's cousin who was sent to earth to protect her cousin, Superman. Unfortunately, her coordinates to earth were disrupted when her planet Krypton blew up and she arrives years later. Kara (Melissa Benoist), aka Supergirl, ends up getting stuck in a time vertex for 24 years and does not age. When she arrives to earth she realizes her cousin is grown and doesn't really need her help so she tries to blend in with everyone else and we will soon see how far that takes her. There are many great characters and actors in this series. James Olsen (Mehcad Brooks), Hank Henshaw (David Harewood) and Cat Grant (Calista Flockhart). I have to say my favorite character is Kara Danvers (Melissa Benoist) because she is brave, strong and courageous. She is only 13-years-old when her parents give her the mission to escape their planet and leave everyone and everything she knows to protect her baby cousin on a completely different planet! My favorite scene is when Kara is talking to her adopted sister and says, \"I think I'm going to go to bed now, I just carried an entire plane on my back.\" It is hilarious! She makes the statement so calmly and it's not every day a girl carries a large plane on her back. The message of this series is \"if someone tells you to hide who you are and not be yourself, don't listen to them because you have to do what you are created to do and that's all that matters.\" We all have a unique purpose that only we can fulfill.

She is good in the action sequences too.The pilot episode has lots of action that reminded me both of Superman Returns (plane scene) and Man of Steel (while fighting a super villain). The custom actually looks a lot like the dark blue suit of the Man of steel. It will probably have less action and more drama in the next episodes when it comes out in November 2015.The music of Blake Neely is good enough, like in Arrow and The Flash, and I like the bright direction of photography.Overall: If you like The Flash I think you will enjoy this too. The producers have done some bold moves with the Flash, so Supergirl might have even more aces in her sleeves. (or under her cape if you prefer). Recommended.",

Yes they put a spin on the real comic book story but these days there are so many alternate universe stories that who actually knows what the original should be... She is old enough, Supergirl always looked much younger than Superman anyhow so I don't really care how she got to earth and what the age difference is.It is great that she flies and does all that stuff, who wants to wait 5 series to see her develop and learn to fly? If they link this to Arrow or Flash it would be event better, 2 heroes that had the powers pretty much straight away.The series are trying to reach to all demographics not just the elitists, I doubt that just the few nerds could push a series without the rest of the population. It has pretty people, super heroes, acting was good no idea why people pick on that, story interesting, we know who the baddies are... so lets see a few episodes now. Would be a shame if they pulled it out.",

            "content": "I'm aware that I initially gave lukewarm reviews first-up to now established favourites of mine \"Arrow\", \"The Flash\" and \"Gotham\" from the expanding DC TV universe, so I'm wary of taking too much from first impressions. I do think though that putting a fully super-powered character into a TV series is a harder sell than a no-power or single-power character, due to the former's sheer omnipotence, plus of course we know what familiarity breeds, i.e. when you've seen one red and blue-garbed super-hero who can fly, be strong, invulnerable, etc., etc,...At least this pilot episode gets the origin story out of the way quickly, again perhaps because it so closely resembles her big cousin's, quickly growing up Kara Danvers to adult or at least early adult-hood and putting her in a similar job to Clark Kent's (and Peter Parker's come to that) on a newspaper. Jimmy, sorry James Olsen gets a PC makeover a la Iris Allen in \"The Flash\" as well as obviously migrating to Metropolis to keep an eye on the emergent heroine as well as boost character recognition for the keen viewer. We're also quickly introduced to the Phantom Zone villains who will no doubt form the continuity theme for the series, whilst new characters such as her super agent stepsister, her Diggle-type boss plus a kooky love interest boyfriend (Cisco, anyone?), look like they'll form the back-up team, again just like Arrow and The Flash. The biggest drawback is undoubtedly going to be the awful Calista Flockhart who must have watched the \"Confessions Of A Shopaholic\" movie, and only that, a hundred times to research her part as Kara's female J Jonah Jameson-type newspaper editor. I doubt even Supergirl's super-strength could force a perceptible emotion out of her Botox-straightened features.The special effects were okay, but the few attempts at humour fell fairly flat. The acting was just so-so too and I'm struggling to pick up either any cuteness or personality in Melissa Benoist as the title character and fear she may go the way of Helen Slater, who by the way, it was nice to see in a cameo role as the mother of the character she herself played in the ill-fated movie years ago (repeating a neat casting trick employed in \"The Flash\" with Barry Allen's father).I do hope it improves but unlike \"Arrow\", \"Gotham\" or even \"The Flash\", I can't see much opportunity for some dramatic weight to the story-lines to come. I'd like to be proved wrong even as I appreciate the show may perhaps be reaching out to a younger, possibly more female-based audience than the three other shows I've mentioned, but I still think that this particular series may struggle to stay up in the air, unlike the Supergirl character herself.",

            "content": "Ugh...where to begin? I liked Season 1 of Supergirl. Given its cheesy moments at times, Kara was an empowering character as she was coming into her own as a superhero. And Alex..Alex was actually my favorite female character. What was great about Season 1, for me, was that there were so many amazing, strong female characters, which is rare for television these days. Then Season 2 came around. I don't even want to get into how awful that season was with Kara taking a back seat to Mon El's story while having to watch her eventually hook up with him and become a side character in her own show. Plenty of other reviews have voiced their disdain for that disrespectful frat boy better than I ever could. I did love the addition of Lena Luthor and Alex's coming out story line. Fast forward to what we've endured so far in Season 3...Mon El is still somehow mentioned in every episode even though he's gone. Tech genius and all around bad ass Lena Luthor has given up LCorp so she can run CatCo...a company she knows nothing about and let's be honest...is a step down from being a female CEO at a tech company...an industry consisting mostly of men. Maggie is still only \"Alex's girlfriend\" and now Alex is suddenly obsessed with having children, (And has been grossly OOC this season) which is going to be the demise of Sanvers...one of the few healthy, positive w/w relationships on screen right now. Not to mention the writers can't even remember their own story lines and are making it up as they go along so they can get in as many jabs at Trump as they possibly can. (They're building a wall?) Really, because last time I checked, in the Supergirl world, Trump wasn't president. The only thing worth sticking around for at this point is the Sam/Reign story line. But I don't think it's worth enduring the rest of the dumpster fire writing that is continuing to plague this show. Sorry to say, I'm done with Supergirl. Which is sad, because I love the SG comics. And I was hoping we'd finally get great representation in a female superhero. Well, I was wrong. Guess I'm going to have to look elsewhere.",

As a young child, she was sent from Krypton to protect her younger cousin who would become Superman. When she finally arrived on Earth, her cousin is fully grown and she got adopted by the Danvers. In the present, her adoptive sister Alex Danvers (Chyler Leigh) is endangered in a plane malfunction and she has to expose her secret identity to save her. She is joined by the Green Martian J'onn J'onzz, James Olsen, techie Winn Schott, and others to save National City and humanity over and over again. There are Lena Kieran Luthor, Brainy, Dreamer, Lex, and many others.There are issues with this show. There is a constant turnover with Kara's Scooby gang which drains the show over time. The first noticeable lost is Calista Flockhart. While I understand the need for a big name, it was probably a mistake to not lock her down for more than two seasons. I get that she wants to retire but it would have been nice to know that before casting her for the role. There are also some very on-the-nose social commentary which are too on-the-nose. It can come off as preachy. At the very least, they slow the show down and the show suffers. Through all of its trials and tribulations, the show can count on Melissa Benoist's sweet sunny personality. She is the big revelation. Before this, her big role was the leading new kid starting in Glee's season four. In this, she becomes fully realized as that sincere little girl saving the world.

Where do I begin, Jimmy Olsen is a big, ripped, confident, jock who acts like superman raised him from birth. The writers obviously didn't do their research, they refer to the Christopher Reeves superman story line a lot and one time, in particular, Jimmy, who wants to be called \"James\" mentions Superman's first heroic feat as saving an airplane...although it was Lois Lane and a helicopter if I recall. Furthermore every other conversation has some sort of blatant feminist agenda attached to it, and they use these off center, awkward, conversations to tell you how strong women are instead of showing you to prove their point. I mean it may have been overlooked if it was just once but they throw it in your face every few minutes, so much so that feminists themselves had to be rolling their eyes. Not to mention actions speak louder than words, I want to see how awesome Supergirl is, if I wanted her to tell me over, and over again, I would go watch some political debate somewhere. The acting was awful, it would be poor for a 1970's sitcom, weird awkward conversations that have no meaning, or feeling, totally unbelievable, corny, and just simply annoying. The writers did straiten out a few story issues, that everyone seemed to have with the universe, but at the same time they punched so many more holes in it, things that just didn't make sense if you've ever seen any other DC superhero in your lifetime. The show was then rushed, within the short time frame they dropped all of the story elements on you, introduced every character, and never really explained when, why, or how. Things just are, now accept it, and I am sure most people will just eventually accept it as the shows continue. I realistically couldn't watch half way through it without throwing up in my mouth. The only reason why it stayed on my TV was because my 4 year old really liked the idea of a Supergirl flying around the sky. If she had any idea what was going on with the conversations or story, she would probably be throwing up too.

            "content": "I enjoyed the first season up to a point, and I was ready for the show to progress and grow in terms of plot, storylines, character development and interaction with the whole DC world. Melissa Benoist is still wonderful in so many ways. She is a solid actress (not the most range, but not too bad) and is a perfect of example of the best of both worlds of pretty and beautiful, without overdoing it on the physicality side of things. She has a good career ahead of her and am looking forward to seeing more of her in other shows and movies.The ideological background plot-line of the show in terms of an overblown political correctness and a corny and oversimplified view of reality is quite disappointing. I also got very upset at the way they have portrayed Superman in his appearances on the show, making him just a little too wishy-washy and sometimes even weak and immature. (no, there's no way he is weaker than his cousin, in any form; those arguments have never been properly put forth)The Luthor family had been given some interesting treatments, but other than Lex's sister, it was a total flop. His sister is the only truly interesting non-central character in the series.Their portrayal of the other Kryptonians and their neighbors, turned out to be another great failed attempt at taking the show in new directions.Terrible villains too, for the most part. (the crossover episodes were a great idea and her friendship with Barry Allen was mildly interesting)There's so much that they have screwed up in Seasons 2 and up, that in my opinion at this point the only way to fix things is to keep Melissa and possibly just the Martian Manhunter character (minus his formerly human alter ego... complete joke of a character) and possibly Lena Luthor, and literally NO ONE ELSE... and FIRE EVERY SINGLE WRITER, the production staff and the director, keeping only the special effects crew and the support staff. I fear the change of network dragged the show in terrible directions. If you have any concern for it's DC origins you cannot like this show (except for Supergirl herself) and it's sad how much they have ruined such a great start in Season one. (ok, not THAT great, more like a 7/10 out of the gate)... I really hope they either improve this show or cancel it out completely. (Sorry Melissa, I do really like you in particular)",

            "content": "Now starting its second season on The CW, Supergirl is one of my favourite shows. Its chief strength is Melissa Benoist as Kara Danvers aka Supergirl. I found her kind of annoying when she was on Glee (although she has a terrific singing voice) but Supergirl is perfect for her. Benoist imbues the character with a dorky adorable charm, yet also sells the action scenes.A big strength of the first season turned out to be Calista Flockhart as Cat Grant, whose snarky wit yet ultimately decent heart turned out to be a winning combination. The relationship between Cat and Kara (and Cat and Supergirl!) was really well handled.All of the supporting characters are charming and likable - although I still don't think they have done enough to make James Olsen anything more than eye candy yet. His upcoming season 2 story line as vigilante The Guardian isn't filling me with confidence.Chyler Leigh as Alex Danvers is high on my list of favourites, and the bond between the Danvers sisters is the real heart of the show. Leigh and Benoist work well together.Early episodes did show one of the ongoing weaknesses - and one common to the Berlanti verse DC shows and that is bringing in a villain for a episode, only for them to be defeated without leaving much of an impression. There have been a few duds on Supergirl too, and the ongoing season 1 arc with the Fort Ross aliens, Myriad and Astra and Non was only partially successful. (I miss Astra and Laura Benanti!) Already, Brenda Strong as the mysterious Doctor from Project Cadmus is shaping up to be a menacing foe.While there are aliens and bad guys to battle, the tone of Supergirl is generally fun and cheerful. Kara is a delightful character, although the series highlight for me is the season 1 episode 'Fallen' when Kara becomes infected with Red Kryptonite and becomes much LESS of a sweetie! Benoist was fantastic as the mean girl Kara.",

GIVE ME A BREAK. why do you think this story is interesting? the market is so filled with propaganda about saving the world that this just does not help, what it does is it uses a stupid pretext of a story in a show that is already filled with feminist propaganda. As i said the writing on this show is just terrible.so yes you have a show with a female lead, do you need to push all this feminist trash on us every chance you get? like \"if god existed SHE would not let this happen\", like it genuinely pains me that the show tries so hard to push this bullshit to us, and does not focus on being a having a good story or good characters or at least decent action.to finish, the thing that bothers me the most is how much potential a female superman has to a good story, but all of that is wasted with stupid lines and stupid propaganda that all it does is bring down the show. so, would i recommend you watch it?

Weather it be the stale script one liners or the predictable soapy style, character returns or even the glaringly obvious and increasingly cheapening political agendas constantly being slid under the door (and several other production reasons to mention), the show just left me with a bad taste in the mouth on an artistic and intellectual level.\nHard to stomach and hard to believe because DC had an excellent chance to put some 'hope' back into the superhero fans of yesterday and today. As I watch, all I can think as a (former) DC fan is how much better a direction this could have been taken in, taking absolutely nothing away from the pc issues your constantly bashed over the head with and if anything giving men/women, straight or gay a realistic AND positive light while being exactly what it should have been.

I'll explain...Although I like the actors for Supergirl, Kat, and Winn, I am less than thrilled with pretty much every other. Mechad Brooks is a badass and absolutely cut out for a killer role in a super hero movie but that is exactly why he should not be Jimmy Olsen... Jimmy is a scrawny nerd and that's the way I like him. The rest of the characters just seem too contrived with the exception of a few cameo characters I could love in anything. Yet, admittedly, I'm not convinced that the issues are because of the characters they cast or because of the incompetence of the writers and directing team.My most severe problems with Supergirl are the story lines and scripts. Riddled with political agenda topics, whiny and jealous main characters, and childish fights, the show has left me cringing so bad for three whole seasons that I'm ashamed to admit I've watched as much as I have. The only reason I've made it this far is because of a deep- rooted loyalty to DC and a misguided hope that the writers would figure out what isn't working. I've given up hope.

I've seen High School plays with better acting and direction.The lead is supposedly 26, yet acts more like 13. She's spineless, simple-minded to the point of near-idiocy, has no self esteem, and cannot make a decision for herself about anything. And this is supposedly a positive role-model for young girls. :roll: The sister is worse; smart enough to get degrees in bio-chemistry, but stupid enough to think she earned her job with the \"anti-alien\" agency rather than getting it because her sister is an alien.The boss is every cheap \"evil CEO\" clich\u00e9 the Occupy crowd ever chanted thrown into one, and then made female to keep the feminazis happy.We're reminded perpetually that Supergirl is a girl, as if her \"lady lumps\" and mini skirt leave that in doubt (though I understand in California, those aren't signs of anything anymore) And yet, we're supposed to think that everyone's complaint against her being a crime-fighter is whats between her thighs, rather than the fact she's has no training, experience, nor aid. The leader of the mandatory govt agency (DEO: department of extraordinary operations; and their name is the least insultingly stupid thing about them in the show)even makes that point after some very ham-fisted feminist whining.Jimmy Olsen is black now.

The character Jimmy Olsen, across all the 80 years of the franchise, can be summed up in one word: Geek. Thats who he is, what he is, what he's supposed to be. They could have made him a Black Geek, except the current unwritten laws of Hollywood forbid it.Also, The \"Black guy/White girl\" pairing; Im so sick of this BS. Somehow, its supposed to be \"celebrating diversity\" to say that in a Supercity, a black man cant find a single decent, honest, respectable, beautiful black woman ANYWHERE??!!! That his ONLY hope of a fulfilling loving relationship is a white girl? What kind of Bigoted @sshat thinks that bullsh!t, much less supports it? All of the establishing character events are done in this episode, making it over-rushed and leaving you indifferent to almost everything that happens. At the end of the episode, the only reason you care even the least bit for supergirl is because this is so obviously blatant plagiarism of the Superman movies with a gender swap (quick, someone call Bru... I mean Caitlyn Jenner) That and the fact that at least three quarters of the episode is actually about Superman, even though they cant really say his name or actually show him in detail. (lawsuits) The major plot hole still hasn't been brought up yet: Kara was supposedly on Earth for 10 years after escaping the phantom zone, growing up; the alien super-max followed her during her escape. So just what in heck were a prison full of (who knows how many) super alien baddies doing for the 10 years that she was a kid? In all, if you want to see a bimbo in a miniskirt hopping around, Go to Tilted Kilt. It might cost more, but at least you get food and beer with the show, and the girls actually know how to play the part.",

            "content": "I really enjoyed Season 1 of Supergirl. Sure, it had its flaws. But overall it was empowering and had plenty of strong, female characters, which is something we don't get so see a lot of all in one show. Then Season 2 happened. And I had to watch as a spoiled, self- entitled, sexist frat boy not only take over the show, but also get to be Kara's love interest. And sadly, his character pretty much took over the show. Not only did Mon-El disrespect Kara on numerous occasions (sometimes in front of her co-workers), but he was full of sexist gibes. The writers literally had him say that he missed objectifying women and not caring when he was on Daxam. How do you have the nerve to tout your show as feminist and empowering when the main character's love interest is saying things like that? It was appalling. The only saving grace of Season 2 was Katie McGrath's Lena Luthor. And I was going to stick around for Season 3 for her even though I knew they were going to bring Mon-El back despite the majority of the fandom and countless media outlets called out the show for having a Mon-El problem. But after the cast mocked a part of the fandom that shipped Lena and Kara together, it's clear they think too highly of themselves and do not respect the fans. So I won't be watching Season 3. And after the messy debacle that was Season 2, I'd say I'm much better off finding a show that appreciates its fans and also doesn't insult female viewers by claiming to be empowering when we had to watch our female heroine get put down time and time again by a toxic male character while trying to tell us that he'd changed and Kara made him a better man. Because one...he didn't change. And two...it's not a woman's job to make a man better. So I'd say watch this show at your own risk. Or just skip it all together. There are plenty of other shows out there where the cast appreciates and validates their fans and where female characters are allowed to be strong and heroic without having to deal with sexist, disrespectful supporting characters!",

It is really interesting (outside most of the soapy 'love stories'). I even like it to a point. However, the so-called \"cross-over\" episode pretty much spelled the death of 'Supergirl' show. Granted, I really haven't seen many episodes (the ones I have BORED me and my children), but with the much hyped event this week, I decided to see what was in store for 'The Flash'. Well, what was the \"cross-over\"?!? An out-of-place scene that looked to have been conveniently stuck within the episode (at the end?). It seemed to have been shot BEFORE any of 'The Flash' episodes this season. Uggh! So everyone sat through the entire episode? You mean little kids and teenagers whose parents aren't watching all of the lesbianism/out-of-closet/two-women-kissing scenes were subjected to that CRAPOLA? Really, CW? Luckily I was in the room and changed channels when the lesbianism poured through the screen! Yes, the CW decided that the series was not even worth the effort that it put 1 1/2 minute \"cross-over\" at the very end of the 'Supergirl' episode! That's right, ratings must be SO BAD that lesbianism for nearly 10 WHOLE MINUTES was MORE IMPORTANT for ratings than anything else! Wow!This episode should mark the death of this series on television! I will NOT return! Beware if you have small children, too. It is unforgivable to have them subjected to social issues that they have no business having to watch!",

The casting is shockingly terrible, Melissa Benoist is not shockingly terrible, but perhaps a little too excited to get a lead role. Calista Flockhart, the powerful, intelligent and mean CEO is not only wooden but obviously very rusty with her hiatus acting. These two followed closely by a number of Hollywood rejects who are just looking for something to keep them busy. The story has no substance or build up and makes a mockery of a very well known and successful franchise. Within the first 20mins Supergirl's identity is made public and she confines in all her friends. She is more interested in being famous....it's like a 13yr old wanting to become a singer/actor. Just end it now and save the money for other projects. Or hire some actual script writers, hire a properly qualified producer and a director that can co-ordinate a very weak cast. If anything, perhaps just send the money to the poor, Syrian crisis, or perhaps the homeless person that stands outside the TV studios. What a pile of crap.

            "content": "Let's get one thing out of the way right away, I'm not a DC Universe fan boy and I couldn't tell you much about any of the people on this show. Nor have I watched the other shows these guys produced like The Flash so i come into this unbiased. I'm not trashing this show just because I think I'm smarter than the creative team. I can discount some of the complaints (or chips on their shoulders I should say) about feminism because the show is called SuperGirl. It's pretty obvious who the center of attention will be. This is your typical hero in the spotlight show with sidekicks and the sidekicks happen to be two dudes. Yeah, the computer guy is a little too sensitive to be believable and the black photographer guy is too wise to be believable. But, putting that aside, let's talk about the real problems here.The series structure is the real problem. Even starting with the pilot, the show runs away too fast. This is probably due to the way they wanted to make the series. Every episode Supergirl has to solve \"a case\" aka Fight someone while there are attempts to weave a background story along the way.The acting, it's all over the place. Sometimes Kara comes off believable but just as many times it just doesn't work. Her baddie aunt never comes off well. The only person who comes off consistently good in the show is the DEO head (Martian black guy).The costumes, as indicated I'm no fan boy and the SuperGirl costume works fine for me. If there's a better one, I haven't seen it. This talk about it looking like a Halloween costume I don't get. If anything, some of the various villain costumes suffer more than anything else. But, that's another issue caused by the structure of the series.The effects, like the acting, the effects are a mixed bag. Some of them actually look really good. Some others look like something someone did on a home PC.The structure of the series is causing almost every issue. After watching 9 episodes, there is very little character arc going on. We're in too much of a rush to even go there. The villains in the show are paper thin. Who has time for that when this week we're fighting nuclear man and next week we're fighting a robot? How can you spend the time to choreograph a good fight scene and effects when these things happen almost every episode? And the fights don't matter very much if the audience isn't invested in the characters (villains too). They're just an excuse to show off a mixed bag of effects, there's no tension. Some of the villains look crappy because there's too dang many of them. If there would have been 3 or 4 the whole season, they would have looked 3x better and the effects would have been solid throughout.So in short, this show is just terribly uneven because of the way they decided to make it. Take a series like DareDevil, different structure and different result. I could see how some people would like the show. In reality, SuperGirl is less a serious TV show and more like a live action version of the Super Friends cartoon. It has about the same level of depth to it as a cartoon. For a series so uneven, I think a 4 out of 10 is a fair score.",

These season long story arcs combined with all the preaching and being as socially relavent and PC as possible is killing the show. The arcs try the patience of even the most stalwart viewer.

I'd feel bad for the actors if they were any good. Also, Supergirl's powers do not seem well defined. Sometimes she seems as powerful as she should be (compared to the comics) and other times not at all. It's very confusing. Lastly, costuming is very unrealistic.

Also they used the same plot device that was used in both Arrow & The Flash (2014)For the rest of the cast, Alex is (believe it or not), a scene stealer and more of a Supergirl than Supergirl herself. It's the 3rd TV adaptation to have an original character as a main character.Winn (Toyman) is the 2nd character that is in actually (soon to be) a supervillain since Caitlin Snow (Killer Frost) in The Flash (2014)Jimmy Olsen was.... So So. though i did like his Signal Watch.Cat Grant.... This version, she has an ego the size of Apokolips. VERY COLD. I'm surprised Kara put up with her.J'onn Jozz was the only reason this show is improving but slowly.Lucy, Gen. Lane & Max Lord was also decent.Good moments: Omegahedron, Martian Manhunter, The Flash (guest starring), the villains (Reactron, Silver Banshee, Livewire, etc.), The Superman alum: Helen Slater, Laura Vandervoort (2 ex-Girls of Steel) and Dean Cain, decent fight sequences. Less on Superman.The Flaws: Pointless speeches & life lessons, a \"Team Supergirl\" (ala Team Arrow & Team Flash), Supergirl working for the DEO, chessy dialogue, being PC, Vartox, Red Tornado, Maxima, Jemm & Indigo are the villains (in actually are the heroes), Supergirl being careless by revealing her identity, having her suit man made, Supergirl trying to be like her cousin.All in all, this show was campy, jovial & fluffy for my taste. Even Mars' last survivor & the Scarlet Speedster couldn't save this show. However, IF they do get a season 2 (minus the flaws), it should be respecting the source material, make it relevant, twists, good fight sequences, dialogue. no plot devices & better character developments, the show would be a little better.I gave Supergirl a 2 out of 10.",

These nitty gritty shows with lots of dark themes and holy sht that's dark and I really like it moments?It's simple. Because - my fellow people who also love this show but seem outspoken - this show is the complete opposite. In the words of a critic on Rotten tomatoes:\"I need a show in my life that's about hope. Supergirl provides just enough sugar in an otherwise bleak diet. People used to dark and grim, need not bother, it's not for you. The rest of us will enjoy it for the pure, blissful fun that it is.\"And I would've put that as my review if not for the IMDb line requirements. Just being straight and honest, I love Supergirl because it's the only show that really puts hope in my heart for a better tomorrow. It always puts a smile on my face and teaches me lessons to make me a better person. Life is too full of the cynical and while some cynicism keeps us grounded, I think we need much much more light in our TV viewings. Supergirl is what i think of when I have a bad day or when I just need someone to tell me it's all going to be alright. If I have a bad day, looking at GOT and seeing someone have a worse day doesn't make me feel better. It just makes me feel even more depressed. I think the critics can see that. This show got a 96% on Rotten for a reason. Not even some of the greatest shows get that on their first season. Believe me, this show knows what it's doing, and it does it not to perfection, rather, to a great effect. If you want to really criticise Supergirl. Talk about its non perfect special effects (I mean, it doesn't really have the enormous budget that shows like Daredevil had), or its sometimes infidelity to its source material. Because these things are things that comic book fans don't like and understandably so. But ask yourself if today's society is just getting so used to being spiteful, hopeless, and cynical about everything and anything (complaining about the world, talking about changing it but then giving up because they say there's nothing that can be done, or otherwise something would've been done etc. etc.). In the end, I'm a truly big fan of Supergirl. I love it. I love it more than the Flash, Arrow, Daredevil and all other shows I've ever watched including Lost.

They shouldn't mess with the story that way. And why can't anyone write good for a strong female superhero character in movies or on TV ? A few years back they planned a Wonder Woman series and that never got off the ground, just an un-aired pilot that supposedly stunk too. In this they made supergirl too wimpy taking all kinds of crap from her boss in her secret identity, trying to be like Clark Kent, and the villains as Supergirl. And would it hurt to have shown Superman at least hand her the new cape he gave her (the baby blanket), what he doesn't have time to show up even for that when she's fighting a group of super villains? Just seemed silly in the pilot even if of course he is not in the series as a regular. I'll give it another chance or two hoping it finds it's footing soon, I doubt it will.

            "content": "This show has seen a lot of love and hate already. I watched the two first episodes and decided to write a review based solely on those. The reason that I find myself qualified for writing a review this early is that I already know what the rest of the show will be like. It will be bad.I must sadly say that I didn't like this show, either. But my reasons for it isn't about race-swap or masculinist philosophy. I didn't think the premise was stupid (come on, all the other shows are stupid too), or that they have switched the race of a certain young man (come on, race doesn't matter here), or that it was feminist propaganda (come on, women are allowed in this superhero nerd club), or that it was somehow offending Smallville (come on, Smallville sucked). I didn't like it because it is a terrible show. It is much worse than the Flash, worse than Gotham, worse than Arrow, worse than Constantine, and even worse than Smallville and Lois and Clark. It is the worst show ever to come out of a DC comic \u2013 ever. And that is to say a lot.The cast and acting performances are reason enough to let the show pass you by. Supergirl is played by an actress that is a really bad fit for a power role. The role of Kara is presented like a bland girl that smells like teen spirit on Nickolodeon. She looks 15 and always has a flustered look on her face (which is caused by bad direction and acting, not her actual facial expression). This makes it seem like a big girl in a big world thing, in which she must buy shoes and find love, all while becoming a superhero. It is all pink and fluffy, all about finding the fifty shades of grey... She somehow works as an assistant or secretary for a newspaper, but it comes off as if she works for a fashion magazine. Her boss is just Ally McBeal: nothing good there. The hateful boss theme is awful and pulls the show down in a very vaginized way. Oh, and there's JAMES, the black, hot Jimmy Olsen... What is that about? Why is Jimmy Olsen a black underwear model type that Kara hopes to get a pity date from? And of course he is meant to be the romantic interest of Supergirl, which is completely ridiculous. There is no chemistry between any of the actors, even the important relations seem bland and artificial. There is nothing to enjoy about the characters or acting. This also means: there is terrible direction at work.And when dealing with a show that features plenty of supernatural action, we need convincing special effects and nice action scenes. But the computer effects are terrible, I mean really, really bad. It looks so incredibly fake and cheap when Supergirl flies and does supernatural stuff. They obviously haven't had the budget that they wanted, and decided to go ahead and try to pull off major scenes anyway. This ruins the whole thing for me. The computerized effects on the Flash are just so much better, for example, and they aren't great, either. Supergirl can't fight at all and when she does, it looks fake and cheap, again ruined by bad CGI.The worst part of Supergirl is that it seems anti-feminist to me. There is no trace of a strong woman on the show. Much of it lies in the way Supergirl is portrayed in relation to Superman. Kara didn't become a Superhero because Clark became a good one, so she decided to just hide her powers and live like she had none. Until one day, she saves her sister and then wants to be a hero. But what is up with that? How come she was too weak to use her powers for good? Wasn't there any crime that motivated her? She is generally presented as an inferior superman, inferior because she is female, inferior because she is too feminine and cutesy, scared and weak. Her entire way of behaving as both Supergirl and Kara stinks of weakness and cowardice. Even when she fights, she looks scared and cries about being hit. It seems as if they really want to present us with a feminine superhero that is much weaker than any counterparts on other shows of the same type. They had no interest in giving us a strong female in the lead. They wanted to give us a little girl, all scared and puny.I hated the show for the above reasons in particular. I am not saying that you should hate it, too. I am saying that I, myself, hated it. I feel sorry for the men that hates the show because they see some kind of feminism in the show. There is no trace of a strong woman on it. The men that hates the show for that reason, will not be happy until Supergirl becomes Superboy. And I think that is pathetic to wish for. Supergirl had potential, all ruined by terrible writing, directing and acting. Of course, I also feel sorry for the people who enjoy the show, because they deserve so much better.I have no doubt in my mind that this show will be cancelled by the end of the first season. See it while t lasts. Or don't. Either way, you won't remember it in a year.",

Start 2nd season they feel need to actually use Superman obviously to boost the TRP but what is this the puniest looking Superman ever. Of course they wanted to show Supergirl to be intimidating but they didn't have to get a 5 foot tall guy who barely looked big enough to play Superboy. But the B-Grade writers these days at DC have been weakening, demeaning and destroying Superman like anything so why not here and they did a good job too.Other than that its cool, Martian Manhunter implementation into he story was inspired stuff and also series was gutsy enough to show Homosexual relations openly. But still I would say being a Feminist is fine but being a misandrist is lame and hypocritical so is a series that is so.",

It's successful not just because of the subject matter (zombies), but because it takes the subject matter and plays it straight. People thrive on intense characters. In today's day and age they could have made a dead serious version of Supergirl which BTW has never been done. CBS fell back on the old, \"let's make this a lighthearted family show \" mentality which ends up losing true comic book fans. TV is filled with comedy shows and other silliness , do we need more of this with a character like Supergirl? Supergirl could have been dark and edgy. You could still have the black Jimmy Olson but not the cheesy TV style version. Supergirls costume is wrong as well. Put a smaller S on the upper right hand corner like was used in the 70s and 80s comics. This Supergirl looks straight out of the 1950s. And yes, as others have said, the female empowerment angle was played to the hilt. She's a woman and filled with superpowers, why the big sell on how important her gender is? The show is filled with cardboard characters and acting from a bygone era.I gave it two stars because there was an attempt to give some decent fight scenes.

But it is not just her, the whole cast is incredibly talented, and the scripts are sophisticated but emotional, the photography and FX are above average TV, it is really an incredible show to watch.The Geek fandom gets a bad rep when it comes to accepting female Superheroes, and the divide amongst the fandom caused by certain movie that should not be named didn't help. But in reality as a proud member of the Geek community I can attest that we absolutely love empowered female Superheroes; we live in the era of amazing female characters coming to life, characters like Black Widow, Jessica Jones, Wonder Woman, Quake, Melinda May... and now we have Kara Danvers, who is an amazing addition to the golden era to be a Geek.THIS is how you make a Superhero TV show, this is how you make an alien from another planet likable (I'm looking at you, Zack Snyder), this is how you make people believe that a woman can fly.",

The acting, the script writing, the hopelessly pathetic \"super hero\", the instant caving into bad press, the instant bad press generated by a jaded? public (how could the public be that quick to judge?)That it's based roughly on the Superman story of her being affiliated with a news agency in a lowly position is OK, not super original, but as long as the actors and script writing makes it interesting, so what. But for her to be so groveling and with such stupid / ridiculous scenes coming from the scriptwriters is not acceptable. I don't think its a spoiler to say she's up against criminals from her home world from the very first episode. So not only is there little to no development as she's growing up and into her powers (she doesn't even use them for cripes sake in her formative years), she has zero self-confidence and once she does bust loose with her powers to help others, she's pitted against the strongest, most evil adversaries imaginable, and a public that is pass\u00e9 on super heroes and are super critical of her from day one.My favorite superhero stories give you background as to who they are as a person and what they're willing to do to seek their revenge / help others / have a moral conscience / etc. Here, nothing. If you identify with someone who isn't self confident but ultimately has value, then you might think I'm being too hard, and as a guy you might think I can't relate to what a young girl would be going through. But I'm sorry, there's little to no character development here, its like we're plunged right into the 3d season of a B movie quality TV series from the 80s or something. I watch mostly movies and TV series of the last 15-20 years because of how amazingly good acting, scriptwriting, production values have gotten. Not so with this bomb, I wanted to give it a second chance, and did watch the 2d episode only to find myself going over and over again, \"Wow, this has got to be the worst scriptwriting I've seen In forever\", and while the acting is not great, I mostly blame the scriptwriters and producers for such a lame concept of how to draw an audience into a story of a female equivalent of Superman.

And how is that bad is because I was picturing it to be super light hearted and jokey. At least tat is how I felt about that at the time. And if you already read my Reviews for the first Flash and Supergirl Crossover back in season1 of the show. And if you haven't to sum it up it's what got me to give Supergirl a chance. That's how much I enjoyed that one episode at the time. And so, from then on I've decided to wait until the start of Season two to really try it out, and I have to say I wasn't disappointed I didn't feel Lost or Confused or Out Of Place. In fact, I was able to fallow along and start to learn who's who and begin to form emotional connections with each character......well some anyways. And as for her Suits I Loved Both Versions of it she looks great, and if you have read my Stargirl Review than you already know that I thought Malissa Benoist looks great she doesn't look like some kind of Cosplayer going to Comic Con or something, she actually looks like an actress playing a Superhero. And that is one of the reasons why after the conclusion of the second season I have decided to give in and buy the first season, on Blu-Ray and Not only my Fears of it being like the Reeves Superman Film was un founded. But also, I was latched on to every single episode, and by the time that third seasoned premiered I considered myself a Full Fledge Fan.And as for all of the Speeches that happened through out the entire series it not only inspired the characters it also Inspired me and gave me Hope in Real Life. Every time that I listen and watch one of those Inspirational Speeches, I Felt Impowered and well Hopeful.Anyways although I loved almost every season because they seem to have a main message to each one. And when Tyler Hoechlin came on as the Current CW Superman, I Honestly thought that Suit Looked alright in fact it felt more distinct from Tom Welling's Superman Suit, whom I believe was inspired by the Superman Returns Superman Suit, but Tyler Hoechlin's Superman doesn't look like any Superman Suit that has been seen before. Anyways back to Supergirl, I enjoyed some of the changes of some of the characters compared to their comic book counterparts. And the Best Part is Lex Luthor I'm so glade that hey kept him Bald but Importantly they didn't write him to be this over-the-top type of Lex Luther, he's closer to the Michael Rosenbaum and less like the Movie Lex Luther's when it comes to Live Action Lex Luther as concerned. And his Introduction was Surprising to be Honest I thought that He'll never show up on CW since they have Lena Luthor to be the Supergirl's Lex Luthor. Since they started out as friends and eventually Enemy's for a short period. And speaking of Yes, I wished they Had Lena be 'Bad' or a 'Villain' a little longer but considering when she became the 'Villain' I could understand why she wasn't a 'Villain' for very long.The final episode was Great Yes, I wished they spent a little more time fighting but considering what else they wanted to do but, considering the Epic Scoop of it. And speaking of I truly thought it was a satisfying ending, just the scoop of it was kind of disappointing to me. I guess I was expecting something a little more Epic or Tragic, I guess. And Finally, I Loved How Supergirl Literally Evolved through out the years. She started the show off as Supergirl Hence The Name Of The Show, by wearing that Signature Skirt of hers. Then Later in Season Five she went From being Supergirl to being Superwoman Essentially. Because that is when she started Trading her Skirt for a Pair of Pants in her New Supergirl Outfit, Despite Everyone still called her Supergirl for the sake of the Name of the Show. When she Wore that Pants it's like she Grew Up From a Girl, a Supergirl to a Mature Woman a Superwoman.And now for the Negatives. The Frist The Series isn't perfect for a start there a few Episode that I'm Exactually Happy With to be Honest. Such as the Episode Title 'Blood Memory' I thought the Transformation Effects and the creature Design for that one gori that transforms into that Rage Monster thing was Beyond Horrible. Next is the Final Season I Felt was a Mess Sadly Much like the Final Season for the Once Upon A Time Show. But Back to Supergirl, Most of the Episodes on the Final Season I felt was basically about nothing. And Not only that I found that there is at leas one episode that was so unbearable that I had to quit Unfortunately. Sadly I felt that the Final Season finally picked up in the really late run it, before then I felt that the episodes that dealing with the Totems was kind of Up and Down, that entire Final Season didn't really feel like a Supergirl show to me until the Final Fourth Episode Sadly. As I have sad before or at least alluded to the final Fight was a little too short and the two Big Bad's where too easily defeated in the final fight. As Good as the Final two Episodes where since they were Aired on the same day, I just didn't feel any emotions whenever I was supposed to, I don't know why I just didn't it's not like they where all of a sudden bad actors in the final two episodes or anything or the scenes where bad filmed I just didn't sadly. And finally, I guess this kind of a Nip Pick. But I wished they had more Epic Mid Season Finals kind of like the Scoop of almost every CW Arrow and at times CW The Flash. Of course, I'm talking about the scoop of so Epic that it would not only Leave you at the Edge of your Seat but also make you wished that you could just Skipped Christmas all together just so you could find out in this case to Supergirl Next. And Speaking of Christmas Episodes I was Hoping for more than just the one in Season 4. Which also happens to be that Epic Leave you at the Edge of your seat making you wish you could skip Christmas all together just to see what happens to Supergirl Next type of Mid Season Cliff-hanger.Final Thoughts, Despite all of my Negatives. Despite everyone completely making CW Supergirl Out to be this Frankenstein Style Of Mistake. I'd still going be a Fan Of the Show even long after the Ending Of The Show Ends much like I am doing with Once Upon A Time, and of course no matter how much others Trash CW Supergirl I still Choose to Ignore all of that, because that's how much I enjoyed the show and well still continue loving the show long after the Ending of The Show. It seems I'm Not Alone Either as I have Literally been reading Comments on YouTube About Malissa Benoist talking about her Role Through Out The Years playing Supergirl/Kara.",

            "content": "It is sad to see that people have rated the show as low as 6. I don't know what you are comparing the show to and why you think it needs to be dark and gritty and a wannabe for what Marvel has to offer with its shows. What I like about the show is that though there are stereotypes and the usual tropes, what this show does differently is try, honestly try to answer the following questions: 1. If we found that there were Aliens among us with God like powers we would definitely try to find a way to keep them in check. 2. As is addressed in the show there will always be haters and you cant keep everybody happy which is evident as to the rating this show has got. 3. Supergirl starts out as an average, nerdy girl who knows she has great potential but has to keep herself subdued because the world has superman, she is a girl and she has been brought up by her foster parents to believe that being normal is to try to fit in. But if you have greatness inside you, why shouldn't you break the shackles. If you feel you can make a difference why shouldn't you make an honest attempt at least once in your life. This is how supergirl starts out, unsure, prone to make mistakes and they have tried to give a very humane touch to it. What I also like about the show is that there is room for levity and a little bit of kitschy romance similar to Flash and I love the hell out of that show. I also love the homage to actors who have portrayed the man of steel and the girl of steel on screen before. The villains although have unbelievable origin stories, they have still tried to be true to the comics. I believe that this is an honest and earnest attempt to portray a woman as a superhero on screen, somebody who isn't bad ass, isn't angsty all the time (here's looking at you Jessica Jones), isn't overly moralistic and her problems are real problems people face in real life. Incorrigible bosses, people who are ready to blame you for the slightest of mistakes even though you were trying to do it for the greater good. The special effects are decent and the acting although not phenomenal but it holds up. Melissa Benoist has done a good job. Calista Flockhart's portrayal of Cat Grant is spot on, I work for a corporate and I have seen women on top behave in this way, they have to come across as ruthless because it is a man's world and if women do not behave like this they are not taken seriously. I have worked for such bosses myself and believe me her portrayal is almost spot on. I feel that this show has its heart in the right place, please don't try to dissect it, watch it for what it is, a tale of a woman trying to fit in, a woman with the potential to change the world but with the challenges that everyday women face.",

Really!!!!!!!! And on top of that this show has become about hatred towards the male gender. So there narrative is \"lets lift up women and transgenders and then demonize males as toxic and horrible people.\"The first season was great and so was the first half of the second season, but the minute a conservative became president you can literally see the narrative of the episodes change to hateful and bigoted.

            "content": "I started out watching Supergirl from the onset, but the show has just deteriorated. For the most part, the writing is substandard, and ever since Supergirl's sister, Alex, came out, the show has been nothing short of an ad for LGBTQ. The relationship between Alex Danvers and Maggie Sawyer is nothing short of mawkish. The plot line between the two has nothing to do with any of the stories. It is all, \"Are you really gay?\" \"Are you really into me?\" \"Of course, I am. You're my forever love.\" OMG! Why don't they just take out a billboard? This is losing me as a viewer.Characters have been distorted from the comic books. Snapper Carr in the comic books was a teenager. Dick Malvern was Linda Lee's (later Linda Lee Danvers) boyfriend. Now, he became a villain. Lena Luthor, because of the disgrace to her parents by Lex, had their names changed to Thorul, and Lena, who had not a bad bone in her BLONDE head, had ESP resultant from one of her brother's experiments. Kara was not older than Superman, but was born more than a decade later, her parents having survived Krypton's explosion by having had their city blown away in one large chunk with the fortune of having a dome to preserve the air, though lead sheets had to be spread to protect the inhabitants of Argo City from the ground, which had been turned into kryptonite. When Supergirl was 15, a meteor storm punctured the dome and the lead, and so her parents sent her to earth, then projected themselves into the Survival Zone, similar to the Phantom Zone, where they later appeared to Supergirl as ghosts, and made her think she was going insane. Linda Lee Danvers parents were both good. No one was a secret agent. Kara had a good relationship with Superman, who insisted that she be trained before her presence was made public. This went on for several years. Linda Lee Danvers never wore glasses. Instead she wore a brown wig to conceal her identity. She also owned an orange cat with a lightning bolt across its body, that became super from an experiment, and which she named Streaky. Additionally, she had a brief romance with a man, who turned out to be a centaur from ancient Greece that could turn human only while a certain comet was near. Supergirl, trying to let him remain him, gave him a potion, though, as it turned out, the wrong one, which turned him into a horse forever. Thus, Comet, the Superhorse was born. Comet, which could communicated telepathically, still had the mind of a man, but later joined the Legion of Super Pets, which included Superman's dog, Krypto, Streaky and Super Monkey, who had acquired his powers as a test animal in space. Meanwhile J'onn J'onzz in the comic books, was a changeling Martian, accidentally teleported to by a dying scientist, who left him stranded to join the police force as a detective named John Jones, whose one vulnerability was fire.Anyway, I decided to watch last night's episode, Midvale, and was pleasantly surprised by the Nancy Drew/No Aliens episode that starred Izabela Vidovic as young Kara and Olivia Nikkanen as young, not yet lesbian, Alex. Great casting on both roles. If only the other episodes could match this one. Alas.",

            "content": "The best propaganda pieces all have one thing in common: the colors of its country's flag, claiming to be for patriotism, for America, even for world peace sometimes, in order to get its infantilized idea across, despite it being perceived as crazy by its target country, making no attempt to grow an audience of critical thinkers. I once said to an entertainer, \"if you're gonna be wrong, at least be funny, Kevin\" (I wonder if he actually read the message). Likewise, I want to tell the Feminist writers for Supergirl, that if you're gonna be wrong, at least be entertaining. Because Feminism is a dead-wrong idea- as many religions are. But feminist writers have created/taken part in amazing works of arts before: \"Who Shot Johnny?\", \"Jessica Jones\", \"Mad Max: Fury Road\", all beautiful creations I've read and watched twice. So is Supergirl wrong for having Feminist ideals in it? Nope. It was bad because:It was too friggin PREACHY!! You know how annoying and boring that gets?!?! It's free to keep its worldview of progressivism, but to just talk about it at random points without giving any good reason why...buzzwording, word vomit, pandering, virtue signaling, whatever, it's uncreative and therefore becomes BORING, which is the greatest sin a writer can commit. It doesn't matter if it's a show aimed at kids. They're kids, not idiots. Dr. Seuss is famous because he wrote messages that challenged both children and parents alike, while being under the guise of being a plain children's author. But writers nowadays only care about what SELLS easier more than what is GOOD, sometimes confusing the two as the same thing. CBS didn't pick up the character because she's actually good (she can be), they picked it up because there was a demand for a female feminist superhero, and Wonder Woman wasn't available (anymore). Supergirl has always been moldable. The viewing audience don't like her because she's good, it's because it's easy for women to fit into her shows (a blank slate, like Hannah Montana) and be as good as the big boys, all on a character that sports American colors, making it justifiable to boil down political/social issues into meaningless one-liners. Example: \"She can't beat him.\" \"Why, because she's a girl?\" If by girl they meant 22-year-old with the mind of an adolescent, then yes. And sure, comedy is subjective...it was just never clever. The action was good until it became predictable. The older sister got lucky too many times, she should've been dead at episode 3. The plot was going somewhere good halfway through, then it just became a meaningless rehash of better show plots. Not much critical character examination. Way too much talk about meaningless romances. Character motivation wasn't always explained. Did they really have to make her appear great just because she was surrounded by weak people?I thought there were great moments in this show, *(spoiler alert): like when she was human for a day and at the risk of her life she convinced a robber to give her his gun. That was well-thought out.*Finale was mediocre. She didn't seem to care much for her Uncle, if that's where the struggle was.Maybe they did have a heart set on Supergirl...but they just treated even their target audience as stupid children who were gasping for self-esteem like they were running out of oxygen. \"You can do it, because you just can!\" What is that going to add to society? Is confusing impressionable young girls with identity politics gonna help anyone?This needs to be categorized in the same group that God's Not Dead 1 and 2 are in: Preachy, Propaganda, Rehashed pieces. Supporting this show by giving it high ratings or buying it when it comes out on DVD is sad (call it a guilty pleasure if you must), because this does nothing for the world except make people believe an ideology without actually thinking about it. I. Whatever entertainment value it has will be in your mind short-term; but It's mind-block on critical thinking can last a long time. At some point, Supergirl's High Priest, Cat Grant, said to Supergirl and The Flash and friends, \"You all look like the cast of a CW TV show,\" and the music and conversation played on as if it was hilarious. And I cringed so hard that it made me look to heaven, bend my knees against the wall, and say, \"Lord, I must castrate myself. This world is too stupid now, I must castrate myself before it becomes worse.\" And castrate themselves they should.",

            "content": "Having been a huge fan of the first season, I was increasingly disappointed by the continuous decline of the quality of story telling and lack of originality in Supergirl. In fact a great deal of the Villains and plot lines in the show are poorly plagiarized from the 1996 DC animated series the Adventures of Superman. Except remove Superman and insert Supergirl. Now there is a fine line between an adaptation and blatant plagiarism but it says a lot that the writers of this show did not bother to look in to the myriad of sourced material available to them for Supergirl. For a show that expresses itself as a feminist platform slapping Supergirls face over classic Superman plot lines is beyond lazy and insecure.Perhaps the most original part of the show has to be the adventures of Alex and her lesbian exploits. Imagine Supergirl and Martian Manhunter are off fighting a powerful villain, the suspense and drama is finally kicking in. Now fade to the next scene, Alex and her relationship problems. Alex is a good character. However the writers continue to focus on her homosexuality as the most interesting/important thing about her, to the point its almost comedic.The universe of Supergirl mirrors real life political agendas and opinions of our real world. The writers dont give their viewers any sort of credit to be able to figure out whats being said before they blurt out \"HEY THIS IS WHAT WERE SAYING\" even though it is painfully obvious. The writing for every DC show begins to tank after the 2nd season its a running joke with in the community of DCU lovers but no one is laughing. Supergirl is no different and its a shame because the lead casts of the show are absolutely brilliant in their roles. In fact not only did the show manage to cast in my opinion the best on screen Superman, they managed to cast the best on screen Clark Kent.So if you're a dedicated DC fan and want to enjoy the show its simple have the fast forward button handy after season one. Skip through the boring scenes. Because buried underneath all of the political agendas is a decent show with some powerful moments but you'll have to dig through the mud to find it.",

If there were a lack of women in the source material, this is the logical thing to do. Emasculating a fantasy world we all know and love won't solve the issue of Inbalance; male and female characters with realistic conflicts who learn to work in sync to complement each other, now thayd make sense as a 2018 moral-of-the-story type of superhero drama. Maybe we need better men, and more women in our stories, not TRANSPLANTING women into roles at the expense of the preexisting strong males. I tune in for the crossover and maybe one other episode to see if they have learned, but alas, season 4 is the worst of all so far. And frankly, making Superman overly gentle, passive and all \"I dunno Kara I trust your judgement more than mine even though I'm older, wiser, and have been Superman way longer than you've been out of high school\".... Is lame. Makes no sense. And it's an affront to fans of Superman from the past 3 eras, TV and comics included. Even Brandon Roth seems tough compared to the Yahoo the Supergirl casting crew picked. Superman can be gentle and compassionate, and still be a decisive, type A man; still be a warrior and see life as precious. Supergirl could have been great if it we're more balanced (like the real world is) with men of both personality types, more of them, and women and men both learning from each other or how to work together. Or don't! No social justice lesson at all, and just tell a story like Smallville did and let good stories inspire and speak.for themselves.

Just before the election we get a Trump negative reference, one of the main characters coming out as gay, and then it is promoting aliens establishing themselves in our country? Good grief. Did they run out of actual story lines already or are they just pushing a political agenda down our throats when we were trying to get away from all the political crap? And then there are the stupid office and closet sex scenes... the whole show is going downhill. If I want to see garbage I can watch any primetime station. Can't there be one place to get away from all the junk and just have some old fashioned fun? Television has become mindless. And Supergirl is now a liberal agenda instead of fun and fantasy.",

            "review_title": "Supergirl Season 1 \u2013 Earthbound when it should be soaring",
            "content": "In the first episode, Supergirl attempts to fly after not having done so in years. She's up, she's down, she's up, she's down, \u0085 And that's the way the first season went except whereas in Episode 1 Supergirl finally soars, the freshman show never quite gets airborne. Supergirl has a strong cast and an exceptional hero yet its ratings weren't high enough for CBS to renew it (it was sent to the CW network). So what went wrong?What worked: Melissa Benoist \u2013 With the show build around her, casting Supergirl correctly was critical. Fortunately, Ms. Benoist isn't just good, or even great. She is, in a word, \u2013 tell me you didn't see this one coming \u2013 \"Super\". As Supergirl, she was completely convincing from her beginnings as an eager, earnest, but inexperienced heroine to the season concluding mature, composed, and confident champion. As Kara, she's a bit klutzy but I guess one has to try something to pretend folks won't realize you're Supergirl's doppleganger. Regardless, she owns the role and hits a home run way, way out of the park.Relationships \u2013 If Ms. Benoist was the heart of the show, relationships were its soul. With its perhaps too large cast, there were more relationships than time to fully develop them but the big three were SG \u2013 Alex, SG \u2013 Manhunter \u2013 Alex, and SG/Kara \u2013 Cat Grant. In these, the parties grew and changed for the better. The issues were significant such as the baggage Alex carried from growing up with a demigod or Supergirl coping with a trusted friend (ultimately learning it was Alex) killing one of her two remaining blood relatives or Kara mentoring Cat on family and being mentored on hope. All in all, really good stuff.The show's tone \u2013 This isn't Zack Snyder's universe of dark, morose characters. In fact, the closest parallel to Supergirl might be Officer Hopps in Zootopia. Both are driven to protect and help, they refuse to give in to overwhelming odds or give up after failure, and both are perpetually optimistic or at least don't stay depressed for very long. But this isn't bad. Most of the recurring characters in Supergirl could be role models and while I feel it's certainly a female-centric show, I don't see that it's misandristic. Except for Maxwell Lord (always the sharpest though most bent blade in the drawer), the featured males equal the women as role models. What doesn't workJames Olsen \u2013 In the comics Jimmy, as he is called, is an impetuous, freckled redhead. Mehcad Brooks definitely isn't but it's not his lack of freckles or red hair that's the issue. Rather, it's the same Olsen issue that exists in the comics, that of getting face time with the hero. The comics dealt with this by having Olsen getting into trouble (remember \"impetuous\"?) and Superman saving him. That clearly isn't going to work on this show. Mr. Brooks is second billed yet is the least defined of the major characters because of his lack of quality screen time. In a superhero action/adventure show, the playground of the hero isn't a place for normal mortals. The DEO field agents are supposed to be highly trained operatives but if their name isn't Alex, they might as well suit up in Star Trek red uniforms. So if not in the field, how does Olsen interact with Supergirl? The writer's appear to be taking the romance tack for more face time but comic writers tried this with Lois Lane for 73 years before finally killing the idea of a Lois \u2013 Clark/Superman romance in 2011 because of the problems integrating her into his action/adventure universe. The producers should never have introduced Olsen into the show. Mr. Brooks would have been much better served being cast as Maxwell Lord, National City's morally challenged answer to Tony Stark, who could find ways to participate in fights or disasters without being completely out of place and is intrinsically more interesting than Olsen. As it is, Olsen is a millstone weighing down the show.The writing \u2013 Even Ms. Benoist can't carry a show where the writing doesn't provide some foundation for her to stand on. In what was the most fun episode of the season, the Flash crossover, a second rate villain takes out both Supergirl and the Flash but is then defeated by firemen with a hose. Huh? Or in the continuity department, Supergirl flies into space to say prayers over her Aunt's casket yet in the season finale, going into space is a one way ticket to death since as Alex says, she can't breath, can't fly, can't return from there. Or after building up the Supergirl-Cat relationship, coming back from Christmas break and having Cat go off the rails and out of character by firing Kara for not confessing she is Supergirl. For all these little things, the larger issue was there was no compelling Season 1 story line. Fort Roz appeared intended for this purpose but half the episodes had nothing to do with this line and didn't advance it in any way. And Fort Roz was fatally flawed from the start, at least in terms of logic. Since Roz came to earth with her, why did the criminals wait until she was an adult to make their move? They outnumbered her tremendously but never just tried to overwhelm her? Pretty bumbling criminals. In summary, Season 1 was OK but not more. The ingredients for a great show are there but the writers need to up their game, come up with more compelling antagonists, develop more than just a \"villain of the week\" approach, and provide more for Olsen to do than just stand around and respond to Cat's \"I want a picture\" with, \"I'm on it\" or be in a doomed romance. But with Ms. Benoist in the lead, there's hope for Season 2.",

Supergirl is beyond just a women in a cape, she fights for the people, she fights for the ones she loves, she believes in the impossible even when others don't or turn the other way. Supergirl stands for HOPE, Hope for those who don't have, for those who can not speak loud enough for those to hear, and she gives hope to those who can't see the light they are given to shine in. She resembles so much more then a female light, or a beacon of hope she is what i can call a HERO. I'm Happy That Melissa Benoist Auditioned For Supergirl and I'll Miss her.

            "content": "Okay, where to start. This is 2016, era of the comics movies and TV shows. Movies like Man of Steel, The Avengers have set the bar pretty high for the quality of the TV shows that are following them. In accordance to that, and the DC shows which are running right now, Supergirl has the weakest story line, CGI and not to mention, science of it.Well, science is a tricky part when you're dealing with a being of god-like powers. Still, in The Flash, when he runs at Supersonic speeds, he usually breaks glasses around him (Later the Speed Force keeps him from destroying stuff around him while running fast). Yet in the Supergirl promo/trailer, we see her creating a sonic boom while flying away in front of Catco..leaving the glass buildings around her intact. Anyway, it's not so important for everyone. Then there is the scenario where two super-powered beings are fighting. It's like watching Rousey and Holm fight. In MoS, when Supes and Zod were at it, super-powered beings as they are..created shock-waves with each punch they were throwing at one another, trail of destruction piled up as a consequence of the fight. Yet in the show, we see multiple super beings fight with little to no redress around structures to follow. Watching two powerful beings fight should be a feast for the eyes in this era with the CGI effects and all, but sigh. It's like watching Smallville all over again.Talking about Smallville, Kryptonite was basically sold at random shops for free almost and government had infinite access to them, even though it's supposed to be a super rare element. Glimpse of the same domain can be seen in this show.Although started off too cheesy, it did get a bit better with the story later on adding a low point..too much spices were added in a simple soup dish. I am still hopeful for this show, given that writing several stories and scripts about an overpowered being can be difficult.",

Calista Flockhart's Cat Grant provides an excellent foil for Kara and Chyler Leigh is terrific as always I especially like Mehcad Brooks as an updated Jimmy Olsen. The purists, predictably, are wailing and rending their garments at everything about him from leaving Metropolis to not being a freckled ginger or a brainless goof ball. I think it was an excellent creative decision using him as sort of a stand-in for Superman, thereby avoiding the danger of her being upstaged by the more familiar character.These sorts of creative liberties and deviation from \"cannon\" are essential in a franchise that's over 50 years old. I'm looking forward to lots more \"Supergirl\".",

The pilot episode felt a little too cheesey for it's target audience, but i was willing to hang in there.Supergirl was supposed to be about Kara Zor-El coming to earth and stepping out of her cousin Superman's shadow to become a hero in her own right.Instead we are given episode after episode of a cast of neurotic relationship hungry idiots who can't seem to get a date with anyone even remotely balanced and stable. Inbetween relationship woes, we'll see Melissa Benoist suit up to fight a bad guy before returning to her latest round of \"why can't my boyfriend change everything about himself to be a cardboard cut out of what i want?\" Oh, sorry, spoilers for season 2 right there.The show will occasionally try to prop up it's ratings by having guest actors appear from related shows. Helen Slater from the Supergirl movie. Dean Cain and Teri Hatcher from Lois & Clark. Lynda Carter from Wonder Woman.But the biggest offense so far is having Superman appear on the show, suddenly not be able to do something, after years as a seasoned hero. The only conclusion I can draw is that in order to amplify or strengthen Supergirl they must diminish Superman.Women's empowerment is a phrase used often with this show. Normally I'd expect to see women trail blazing through situations and doing a better job of it. Instead we see a tired and overused formula in a show that can't do anything new.Save yourself the trouble. Be patient and wait for the next Supergirl show.",

And oh yeah, the cgi is just unbearable for this day and age.So Supergirl was apparently sent to earth to watch over her younger brother Kal-El, but she arrived too late, basically. Why Kal-El would need a protection or guidance of an older sister is beyond me and just not in line with Man of steel saga.So when she eventually arrived on earth, had no \"meaning\", because Kal-El was all grown up and out in public, known as Man of steel. So she decided that she wanted to \"change the world\" by getting a job. This makes absolutely no sense to me. She had super powers, with which she could really have an impact on the world, but no, she went and got a job. And lived a normal human life. Now tell me, what idiot wouldn't at least fly around, fight some crime, on daily bases? But she decides to go into being a superhero over night. She has no idea how to fight, she only throws punches. Because who needs to know anything about fighting if they are super strong right? Her speed of flying is also a big mystery, and her \"landings\" are just bad. She doesn't inspire any belief or confidence that she can fly.And yes, she goes for a journalist of course, nothing new here. The only difference between Supergirl and Kara is, you guessed it, the glasses! And of course no one sees resemblance when they see her standing in front of the poster of the super girl. She even made an interview with her boss as super girl, and didn't try to change voice or anything like that.This show is making everybody in it seem stupid. I haven't seen so unoriginal series in a long time. It screams low budget, amateur and poorly written.You might want NOT to watch it.",

They've had their bad moments, and even bad seasons, but they still get the fundamentals of what makes a TV show work. They have good ensemble casts (Felicity from Arrow excluded) with good chemistry, good plotlines, good villains, good writing, believable issues, pretty good CGI, and good acting.Supergirl has none of those things.The writing is terrible, cheesy, clunky, and cringeworthy. George Lucas' \"I don't like sand...\" line comes to mind when hearing the dialogue, but the worst of all of George Lucas' romantic dialogue in the Star Wars prequels is still better and less cheesy and cliche than the majority of the lines uttered in this show.The cast has little to no onscreen chemistry.The fight scenes would be acceptable during the 1970's Superman era, but are laughable and cringeworthy by even 1980's standards.There must be a requirement for every single DC show to have at least one prominent gay/lesbian character because they all shoehorn them in, regardless of whether it has anything to do with the plot or comic book characters, and then attempt to add as many minor ones as possible and/or episodes dedicated to the issues they face, regardless of whether they have anything to do with the episode's plot. I understand that they're trying to be \"inclusive,\" but it really feels forced on this show, and it takes over a lot of episodes that should really be about the title character.The acting is terribly cheesy, and downright horrible at times. It's almost like they hired actors based upon looks, rather than actual acting ability because the cast members looks great, but get considerably less attractive the more they speak and act. The movie \"The Room\" has more believable acting at times than this show (which is not a compliment to \"The Room!\").Even the crossover event with The Flash in the first season is terrible.If you're thinking about watching the show because of the other DC shows that you enjoy, please do yourself a favor and skip it.",

The season one antagonist is done away with two thirds into the series. A heart-rending scene between Alex and her mother is butchered by the horribly inappropriate pop song in the background.The actors all play the roles with sufficient verve, Benoist playing up the charm and Harewood bringing an intensity to their respective roles. Flockheart teeters a little on the two dimensional at times, as does Brooks. But then, an actor can only work with what they're given.The romance subplots need to be shaved away too. It's the same problem in TV over and over again - they add nothing to the story, and just go over the same, predictable beats. Having your female protagonist cry over the man she likes a staggering three episodes in is hardly the feminist utopia the show proclaims.Overall, it would be good if the necessary changes were bad.

            "content": "I really used to like this show. It was never high television, but Kara is a really likable protagonist, the plot was entertaining enough, and so were the supporting characters. Season 1, even if a bit naive and childish, was very entertaining, and a feel-good show, with some very nice, if a bit heavy handed real life parallels. Season 2 started much the same, although there was some frantic retconning, with getting rid of Cat (a huge loss to the show), and breaking up James and Kara (wasn't a fan of the relationship at all, but their breakup was badly done), but I guess I could have moved on from that, understanding the real life consequences of the show moving from CBS to CW, and from LA to Vancouver. However, it all started to go downhill from there. Let's start with the good. I guess, to balance the loss of season 1 regulars Cat Grant, Lucy Lane, and Maxwell Lord, we got some new regulars/recurring characters, Maggie Sawyer, Lena Luthor, and Miss Martian/Mgann. All three of these characters have a lot of potential, and as a female martian, female CEO, and female detective, they are really good additions to a supposedly feminist show, especially with Alex's and Maggie's amazingly heartwarming romance...Let's move onto the bad though: these amazing characters are very much underused. M'gann had about 15 minutes of collective screen time, before she was written off. Lena is in the show every 5 episodes, and goes through the exact same plot for every single one, where people think she is suspicious, Kara believes in her, and then she proves to be good after all, and Maggie doesn't seem to exist outside of her relationship for Alex. The season's main villain (if you can call someone that shows up about 5 times the whole season that), Lillian Luthor, played by amazing Brenda Strong, could have been really really amazing, but because she is not given enough time to be developed, she comes across as 1 dimensional.And finally, the worst offense of all, Kara's character is completely assassinated. She goes from sometimes shy, and uncertain, but ultimately strong and pure-hearted, three dimensional character, to the doormat of her newly introduced love interest. Mon-el, is the fourth \"regular\" character added in the beginning of the season, and I have to say, the reason for 95% of the problems on the show. He is not a good character, he is a clich\u00e9 white fratboy, with the small twist that he is from another planet, but even if he was, the way the show is pushing him is not only annoying, but downright heartbreaking. His character is entertaining at first, but the joke of how he is not aware of earth customs quickly merge from funny to annoying and cute to toxic. The jokes about using the wrong word to refer to women and eating pancakes by the dozens quickly merges to that he claims his life was much more easy, when he could objectify women and not care about anyone. He continuously disrespects Kara, and goes against his wishes, and yet Kara falls back into his arms every time, and the show portrays this as cute banter. Literally the only way they could make him look good, was to put him opposite a dude who threatened to destroy the city, if Kara didn't marry him, and he came out only looking slightly better.Even worse than that, he is inserted into every aspect of the show, and every character, not just Kara is dumbed down to make space for him. We miss important details on the Cadmus story-line, between Alex and Kara, between Alex and Maggie, about Jonn in general (or James), to make space for him, and his relationship with Kara, even though he has no purpose on the show, apart from being Kara's love interest. Kara's whole season 2 arc is centered, and on occasional bright spots, only tied, to him, and yet he shows 0 character development, being the same douchebag to Kara, and everyone else every single episode. So all in all, this show has lost what made it so good in season 1. The feel good, female focused show is gone, and we have 30 minutes of dudebro Mon-el every week, and I am losing my patience with the show. I am giving until the end of the season, but if he is not gone then, I will not be back for season 3.",

It's quirky and light without taking itself too seriously. For some reason directors want to make all the new superhero shows/ movies dark and very serious. There is a time and place for serious, but sometimes in the process you lose the fun factor. I think once and awhile Hollywood needs to be reminded that these Superhero's began in comic books. A lot of us grew up with these comics, and they began as innocent fun. This show is definitely a step in the right direction.

The violence is a bit intense. A villain's death in the pilot was unnecessary, in my opinion, even if it is a Krypton alien. Some good touches: A man is stronger than a girl even on Krypton and although \"invulnerable\" by Earth standards, not totally so against fellow aliens. Please don't turn this into another \"Buffy\" series, please! Future episodes will tell. Even \"Smallville\" was bad for a while with it's \"monster of the week\" concept. The airplane rescue scene was fabulous and so were Dean Cain and Helen Slater as her Earth parents. \"Allie Mcbeal\" is the perfect \"foil\" as Kara's overbearing boss. We shall see about the rest. Superman should show up from time-to-time too. Who will play him?",

The series does not follow the comic books (no surprise), its very feminist - there are no manly men in the show, the topics they choose to pick on are very Liberal - shouldn't the show be about Supergirl fighting bad guy and saving people, not about gun rights, racism, end to violence and LGBT issues in the world? Jimmy Olsen in the Comics was a scrawny nerd who liked to take pictures; not a large man who becomes a superhero! Some of the cast does not flow right; they do not know how to act.But, with that said; there's also something about the show that catches your attention. I think the only reason this show is still making it, is because of Melissa Benoist, she does a very good job acting as Supergirl. She truly knows how to reflect compassion and care in her facial expressions. The show also has heart to it, and it doesn't over rush the story line or overload each scene with action; it has a balance.Out of all of the DC series that are currently airing (Arrow, Flash, Legends, Black lightening), Supergirl is the only one I enjoy watching.",

The second to last episode is an amazing example of that, where they tried to portrait refugees as always virtuous people/aliens that can't do wrong. Not to mention the blatant racism and sexism of this show. (all men and white people that don't share supergirls world view are quickly pushed aside as evil and just asking for a beating)And the second thing this show does wrong is just supergirl it self. As a big reader of Superman I'm decently familiar with the character and aside from just massive changes in character seemingly for no reason but my first point or cheap romance story, like Jimmy Olsen being changed from a small white clumsy ginger nerd to a buff black guy that can't do wrong. The writers quite clearly don't understand what makes superman superman and supergirl supergirl. Superman at it's essence about trying doing good without the limitation of power and the problems that come with it. While supergirl is often about something similar but with heavy tones of finding one's place in the world as a stranger. Meanwhile supergirl has non of that, she fits in everywhere nor has to make hard decisions about doing good. If the writers wanted to push the refugee agenda they could have by writing a decent supergirl story about not fitting in into a alien world. But than they couldn't have pushed their agenda obvious enough it seems.",

Which is, in my opinion, a bold and refreshingly simple direction to take comic book entertainment in from here on.If we have to be subjected to aliens and clich\u00e9d, two dimensional villains, then they might as well happen in a watchable, familiar environment. The watchability begins here with the perky, hot blonde in that red skirt flying around, and continues with her alter ego being bossed around by a female boss at work, while dealing with deep emotional turmoil with her sister at home.CBS is the best right now at capturing audiences' attention, \"The Good Wife\" being one of the most visible examples of this, a show that continues to fascinate viewers and critics on the strength of nothing more than restrained cattiness among beautiful, sophisticated women, with a healthy dose of near pornographic lesbianism thrown in every now and then for good measure. If this show ever has the guts to send this strangely cast black Jimmy Olsen back to Metropolis, and replace him with a black or Asian girl for Kara Zor-El to be interested in, we might have something irresistible.But for now, we'll have to make do with what we have. A pretty blonde girl in a short red skirt and red boots, lifting airplanes in the sky and slamming into trucks on the highway. All while running around in her mousy alter ego, trying to impress her sadistic female boss in the big city. How can you not watch this speeding train of a show, to see whether or not it will run or wreck in the future? But brilliantly, the pilot episode ended with enough heat to guarantee at least some future interest, when they introduced an INCREDIBLY beautiful female villain for our heroine to deal with, who is actually Supergirl's aunt from Krypton, if you can believe it. The idea of this impending woman to woman action has created a rare commodity in network television these days. Genuine watchability.",

It's glossy and up to date, runs quite smoothly and quickly action wise, is well produced but I wonder if it will catch on. Too early on to predict after the pilot but I wish it well.

Firstly the fact they made a series about one of the lower class heros in my opinion doesn't bring much popularity to the series in the first place. Super girl is just super girl. She's not one of the popular ones sorry to say. I think Wonder Woman would have blown people away. More people would flock to that show and I believe ratings would be much higher of the show was done correctly. Much better choice in my eyes. But I found the show to be kind of geeky and boring. Super girl is very silly and childish I feel in the show, she doesn't portray a strong female superhero character people will look up to. She resembles a lost little girl stumbling her way through life and I'm not finding the show exciting at all. Halfway through episode 2 and I had to turn it off cause it did not grasp my interest.

Based on the pilot, the problem was simple - total lack of character development of Supergirl. I don't want to see her learn all the tricks, fly, and start saving falling planes overnight. I wanted to see it developed over time.I want to see her grow up with all the growing pains. My feelings didn't change after episode 2.I was still disappointed after episodes 3 & 4. But I think after episode 5, it just grew on me. The show got a little more serious. It is a balancing act doing the right thing. Do you believe in the death penalty even for monsters and killers? Is it okay to kill as long as you are only killing other killers (like the show Dexter) ?One thing about Supergirl I like that no other Superman/Supergirl show or movie has ever showed - Supergirl learning martial arts. It makes perfect sense to me. I was glad to see this. Why didn't Superman learn martial arts? There are other alien reprobates who are just as strong. But if Superman knew martial arts, he could better fight them. Anyway, I see at times that Supergirl really wants to kill the villains or have her own brand of justice. It's her struggle. I like that. So the take home message is this. Supergirl doesn't have the best writing or acting. The actresses are all pretty and easy on the eye. The show gets better over time. It grows on you.

            "content": "Supergirl is obviously written for women. The cast is not balanced. Plotwise - ever character that matters is a woman - and there are soooo many of them. And of course there's a completely unnecessary lesbian couple - and so many \"relationship\" arcs where characters go overboard and talk about their feelings - to the point of being sappy. This show can't decide if it is an action series with superheroes or if it's a coming of age love story on the hallmark network.I didn't look to see who the writers are - but my guess is that it's not written by women - because it's too sappy and bad for that. My guess is that the show runner and the writing team are misogynistic, middle shed men who *think* these are the kind of trashy, ridiculous storylines that women want to see.Every episode has a misunderstanding that hurts someone feelings and they overreact - this sets up the deep conversation in which they explain their feelings, apologize, swear their love for each other and then hug it out. EVERY SINGLE EPISODE!!!The characters are ridiculous in so many ways. You'd think that in a superhero show, the super powers would be what makes the show \"unrealistic\" - but it's not. It's the stupid things that the characters do and say in order to manufacture an emotional issue that can later be resolved (in an equally stupid way).Every character in the show has had multiple occasions where they have a personal crisis in which they have to choose between doing their jobs - or risk damaging their relationship with some other character. This would be an okay story element if it were consistently done by the same character (like Lucifer and Chloe) - but it's EVERY character and it's multiple times per episode - and the situations are not just un-realistic, they're completely ridiculous.The series is called SuperGIRL - so it's reasonable for it to have more female actors than male - but apparently, in the world this was shot on - there are no men at all that hold important positions! I thought it was clever for then to cast the Villain as Lex Luthor's sister Lena - but the rest of the cast should have been balanced - but it's literally ALL WOMEN!!! Her sister is in charge of the DEA (arguably the most powerful defense agency on the planet) - oh - and she's also the lesbian. The President is a woman. The owner of Catco - the media conglomerate is a woman. Even most of the villains are women. They do sprinkle in a few men in low level positions - and there are 3 \"main\" characters that are men (ie Jimmy Olsen) - but they might as well be women by the way they act and the words they say. They're certainly not like any men I've ever met! Oh yeah - 1 is a robot.The show is complete trash and it's a miracle it's been on for 5 seasons. If you're ever going to create another show with all or mostly women - that's fine - but if you're just going to make them sound like emotionally unstable idiots - maybe it would be better if you didn't.To be clear - I am not complaining about the fact that you the cast is mostly women. I'm complaining about the writers who can't seem to manufacture any realistic drama and create monumentally stupid dialogue and plot elements.",

I grew up on D.C. comics, and though I was more of a Batman/Superman kind of kid, SG was definitely in that pantheon of childhood escapism.Unfortunately, this series is just lacking something. I have a 13-year-old girl and she loved the first season; we watched it as a family. We just finally made it to the end of season 2, and the politics are finally getting to me. I don't think I'm going to re-up for season 3.The first season had a certain innocence and charm about it although of course the writing and storylines were inane. You chalk it up to the fact that it's a comicbook writ large. Still, you'd think they could figure out how to fill in a few of the enormous plotholes.But season two lost some of that innocence. Suddenly, Kara has a boyfriend. Suddenly, she's a serious reporter. Suddenly, Cat Grant is gone. Suddenly, Kara's sister is a lesbian. And suddenly, all those escaped super-criminals from Fort Rozz are gone, replaced by innocent and sympathetic \"illegal aliens\" being hunted down by evil white supremacist types. At one point, they even said an evil invader wanted to \"make the world great again\". (Admittedly, the invader was an alien, but whatever.)Season Three delves even more deeply into left wing ideology, with Cat Grant piously pronouncing that global warming is real and the President can add two plus two, an apparent jibe at Donald Trump and other politicians who have backed off from the Paris climate treaty and other environmental causes.Thanks, but no thanks. I'm done with this Hollywood ideological stink heap. Perhaps they'll discover that jumping into politics will anger some of their viewership, or perhaps it will help their ratings with the 50% or so of the population that agrees with them. The country is split down the middle and one half hates the other half. Leave it to Hollywood to try to exploit that with pious preaching from the Girl of Steel.",

A strong role model for girls in the form of a female superhero could come across way better if they didn't keep talking about her being a woman. Good writers show, they don't tell. You learn that in school. Let the strong lead character shine and girls cam imagine being her, just like how some boys grow up wanting to be Superman. You don't need to hit the audience over the head with your message. Some people wrongly accuse shows of being 'woke' by having strong female or black lead roles. I strongly disagree. Public Enemy were talking in the 1990s about how black people used to always play slaves, butlers or maids in films. That's changed much since then. Similarly, Hollywood used to often paint women as housewives, while the men did the heroic work. Strong female leads is a great idea, and necessary for girls to look up to; as boys have had male heroes since the beginning of storytelling. We don't need remakes of Ghostbusters, but we do need strong female characters. Supergirl is unlike the Ghostbusters remake, in that the comics started in 1972. This is a classic character.

He appears as just a blur. It's brilliant.The episode where she lost her powers and talks a gunman down could show the NRA madmen a thing or two. That was the most profound moment to come out of USA television that I've seen for a long, long time.The haters seem somehow skewed. I don't know why. Supergirl is meant to be naive and young and a bit like the wildest girlfriend you've ever had. Melissa nails it. This is great TV. I enjoy it as much as Game of Thrones.",

            "content": "So probably i'm one of those few people who haven't watched Smallville , Hence a superman or a supergirl story on a TV show is new for me ,, thou unexpectedly i kinda engaged well with the pilot, and liked how it started. They connected the story of superman and how is this girl is related to him and explaining why the 24 years age gap with a Phantom Zone. So it was all understandable and easy to connect the dots.The plot is strong, has a lot of potentials and actually things escalated quickly after the half of the episode ,, kept me a bit more interested , the script seems fine and tightly written as most pilots would be so i hope it stays that way.The cast was (in my opinion) well picked, all were new fresh faces, even Melissa Benoist ,, i haven't seen Glee so for me this is her hit role on TV,, her facial expressions are kinda overused but i think she's doing just fine so far.Also The cinematography is fine and visual effects looked flawlessly used,, a lot of explosions especially in the final couple of scenes.There was actually this one thing i kept thinking about all along the episode ... So i'm not trying to be anti-feminist but the scene of Supergirl ripping out her shirt and a close up camera shot on the S up her cleavage doesn't quite fit well in my manly dirty mind :D :D but as a man i gotta like it ;)Overall, for a pilot Five Months Early leaked it looked really good ... i'm not sure if it's gonna be this new huge CBS Hit like CW's The Flash (which is still On Hiatus for 2nd season and co-owned by CBS) but who knows !! maybe CBS will play the cards better on this and have a multi-seasons show.",

All the mega-corporation heads are women, oh except one guy but then he's a macho, self-centered jerk. The new hyper-feminist trash sexism that's flooding the poor world every day now is present in abundance. This is liberalism propaganda more than simple TV entertainment.The liberal post-humanist agenda is everywhere in this piece of politically correct marketing. Liberalism is a mental illness, but Hollywood producers are apparently too ill to notice how toxic they really are.I gave it a 4/10, for decent FX, some good action, some original story lines that aren't too far from the original comic series and some cool sci-fi technology.But let's face it. When Superman and the rest were invented many decades ago, 99% of the world rejected the LBGT lifestyle as perverse, and of course, they were right.

For example having Maggie's father commenting about how they want to build a wall. Just stop with the constant Donald Trump jabs already. I'm as liberal and progressive as they come, but even I find the constant political garbs off putting and unnecessary. It's sort of like in the debacle that was Season 2 where they had Kara tell Mon El that maybe being Supergirl and being with him was enough when in Season 1 she told J'Onn that being Kara Danvers and having her job at CatCo was just as important to her as her Supergirl duties when he offered her to work full time at the DEO. Do these writers have existing story line amnesia or something?What I'm really irritated with is the show's handling of Sanvers. These writers and show runners knew from the start how invested the LGBTQ community would get in Sanvers, especially after giving Alex such an honest coming out story. But unfortunately, they completely botched Sanvers with a rushed, barely fleshed out story line with minimal screen time...then gave them an unrealistic engagement at the end of Season 2. Now in Season 3 we have to believe that they are going to break up over Alex suddenly deciding becoming a mother is more important that being with Maggie? Really? It's OOC writing and and insult to the healthy LGBTQ relationship they were trying to portray to us. Look, I understand the show shouldn't be relationship drama heavy, and I agree. But these writers are the ones who keep insisting it be shoved in everywhere...and they can't even write a decent relationship to save their lives!I'm officially ditching Supergirl. I'm not here to watch them tear apart one of the few positive LGBTQ relationships that are out there right now. And I'm definitely not here to watch Kara be all moody after Mon El's exit only to have the childish dude bro return in a few episodes anyway. It's gross. Supergirl is gross...a gross train-wreck.",

And now into Season 3, once again, Kara and her alter-ego are taking a backseat so Mon El and more new characters can take over. How much longer do the writers and producers expect us to sit and watch the Mon El and the Legion show? I'd be fine if they were only going to be around for an episode or two to help her with Reign, but for some reason, Supergirl is always getting defeated and needing help. Sure, even a superhero might need help every now and again. But all the time? Unfortunately, there's nothing much keeping me from continuing to stick with this show. The writers had an huge opportunity to capitalize on an inspiring, empowering female superhero, story, but unfortunately, what they've given us is a disappointing mess of a show that continues to go downhill by making their once strong, independent and courageous female characters watered down and weakened, thus contradicting the notion of empowerment so many of us female viewers tuned in to see and appreciated in Season 1.",

Costumes of \"aliens\" and androids look like trash that would come in last on a high school cosplay competition. The acting is horrible, Melissa Benoist does quite well, but most of the other actors put up an extremely poor performance. And then there's the errors made by the director and production team, an elevator shaft that looks to go up at least 20 more floors even though they already are at the top floor. Every episode is full of stupid errors and inconsistencies, not even starting on the amount of stupidity they try to get away with if you take real life physics into account. All in all it's just a very bad show that would profit from a better director and writer.",

There's a nod to the DC Super franchise with cameos from Dean Cain, Helen Slater and a flash of the Man of Steel himself. While debately not as striking as 1984's Slater, Melissa Benoist looks far more comfortable in the duel Kara geek/ Supergirl superhero role. Opening with a expository flashback, an explanation of her delay in The Phantom Zone, arriving late to earth it turns out there's no need to protect Kai-El. And maybe no need for two alien super beings.Its fittingly goofy at times, it's fun, with some good action setups, it has decent effects for a TV show, the tone is also serious at times reminiscent of the Adrianne Palicki Wonder Woman pilot.After Supergirl reveals herself to the world it gets interesting when her presence has a far more of a rippling effect than her cousins and she's introduced to an underground alien monitoring organisation. It's also humorous when Kara begs her boss Calista Flockhart not to coin the 'Super Girl' name. There's some warm scenes with her sister Alex and her mother and it finishes on a teaser with the introduction of her aunty.With a predominantly female cast, it has a positive young vibe and comic book feel, which may give it some longevity in a saturated superhero TV schedule. It's up, up and okay.",

            "content": "I gave the show 2 stars instead of 1 because I did enjoy Season 1. I've never been a fan of comic book television or films, but I gave Supergirl a shot since we rarely see female led shows...let alone a female-driven superhero show. So I was pleasantly surprised by the first season. It wasn't perfect by any means. But it was enjoyable to watch and had plenty of strong women from Supergirl herself to her sister Alex to Lucy Lane and the \"Queen of all Media,\" Cat Grant. Where Supergirl went horribly wrong was in Season 2. From inconsistent writing with way too many plot holes (even for a superhero show) to the majorly problematic character of Mon-El. In fact, Mon-El is why I won't be watching Season 3. Because you see, after all of the backlash from fans and even countless articles done by entertainment media outlets outright stating that Supergirl's problem was too much Mon-El, the show-runners are blatantly ignoring that and bringing him back for Season 3. And let me guess...they are going to tout him as a newly changed man and a \"hero.\" I wasn't watching Supergirl because I wanted a misogynistic douche-bag of a dude-bro not only taking over the show that's supposed to be about Kara, but also reducing Kara to being his love interest. So...what was the problem with Mon-El, one might ask? Well, we could start off with how he missed objectifying women back on his home planet because he was irritated that Kara didn't want to get with him. And that came after he'd already been disrespectful to her on countless occasions. Kara told him on numerous occasions that they weren't a good match, but he kept pursing her and eventually tried to guilt her into not liking him back by throwing out an I love you. And when they did eventually get together (because this is the CW and of course the lead female can't be without a guy), seconds after she asked him to keep their relationship on the down-low, he announced to the whole DEO that they were together, which was just...gross, not to mention highly disrespectful of Kara's wishes. We were told on numerous occasions that Mon-El had changed, but were never shown it. He fixed Kara breakfast and that apparently warranted him being a \"changed man.\" Wow...the expectations are very low with this one, I tell ya. And by the end of the season, even though he kept telling anyone who would listen that he was also a hero, it was Kara that had to tell him to \"go be a hero.\" There a countless more situations I could discuss, but the point of the matter here is that Kara was reduced to being the love interest in her own show. And we could get into how the writers decided to break up Kara and James before they even had a chance at a relationship and then replaced James with a boring, sexist white guy who also owned slaves...seriously, ya can't make this up. I was thrilled to hear that Katie McGrath was going to be in Season 3 as a regular, because I loved Lena Luthor's character. In fact, she was the only good thing about Season 2, to be completely honest. But unfortunately, not even Ms. McGrath can get me to watch again when they intend to bring Mon-El back and pretend like there was absolutely nothing wrong with the way his character was written. If you're looking to feel inspired by strong women, Supergirl is not the show for you. I'd recommend \"Wynonna Earp,\" \"Orphan Black,\" and even a new show called \"The Bold Type\" instead. Save yourself the frustration of seeing Supergirl/Kara fall by the wayside so that a good for nothing frat boy could take the lead and destroy anything good the show had going for it.",

I know sometimes they have to bend things a bit when transitioning from one medium to another. I think its great that JAMES Olsen is now and ADULT and not just someone to put into jeopardy so he can be rescued. Also, the character is a good way to bridge Kara and her cousin. Coming up with her costume is good also, seems like they gave a nod to the changes the book character has gone thru. Although, where did they get and how can they afford any kind of material that is bulletproof. However, they tried to cram too much into the first episode. I think much of what they did could have been spread out over the next few episodes-her sister works for the government alien hunters, there are a bunch of super bad guys loose on earth, her aunt who looks just like her mom wants to kill her. These things could have been spread out, making the series more interesting, involving the viewer-\"Hey, where do these super criminals keep coming from? Tune in next week and find out.\" Disappointed that head of the alien hunters is kind of a one-note guy. And, I realize Calista Flockhearts character isn't Perry White or J. Jonah, but is being a self absorbed puppy stomper the only way to present a strong female business person? If she is so sharp, why cant she remember the names of the staff she sees everyday? \"Nooo, she's a contrast, a foil, for Karas character.\" I think if they can work around these issues we CBS could have a fun, quality adventure TV show.",

As they did in the later superman movies they seriously botched the costume. Supergirl's costume was sexy, this one is not. Seriously, black silk stockings and boots to the mid thigh? and now coveralls? Further,she is not blonde as Supergirl is. Plus, she is a total wimp. I watched in dismay as a human punched her and knocked her down. I was equally dismayed when a crook grabbed a hostage and put a gun to their head while Supergirl stood ten feet away. She surrendered! Seriously, the character I am familiar with could have disarmed ten bad guys before any of them could pull the trigger, let alone one bad guy. The special effects are very good in my opinion. The best flying sequences for television I have seen to date. The settings are lavish and detailed. So it's not all bad. Thus the 2 out of ten rating.And now she has a ...gay sister... who is more capable than Supergirl herself as she has rescued her several times? And they both work for a \"Martian?\" Jimmy (James) Olsen is a masked avenger??? The same Jimmy Olsen who wore a specially made watch to signal Superman when he was in trouble?I think if you are going to make a series that follows an established story, by all means use creativity, But don't shred the original character for your own stories. Perhaps create your own character and put her in a world infested with aliens and dozens of surviving Kryptonians, put her in another dimension or another setting of some sort, but don't make her abilities change unless you have good reason to for the sake of the setting. People are drawn to the character as she is. Why else make a series about her?They made the same mistake with Smallville. For the first five to six years it was excellent as they stayed true to Superman, but then what happened to Superboy? As we all know, Superman went to his Fortress of Solitude right out of high school and stayed there for 12 years. Suffice to say the creators of Supergirl need to rethink what they are doing and get back on the \"Super\" track.I really don't mind the women's equality plug and the gay rights is OK to, but I don't think it should dominate the story to the point that it does. I know today's trend is toward \"Girl\" power and \"Gay\" power. So be it. My opinion is that they don't need to dwell on being politically correct to tell an entertaining story. And that's why the \"super\" fans watch the shows, read the comics, and spend millions at the movies, to be entertained.Final word, watch a few episodes and see if you agree, I'm finished with it.",

(By the way I'm definitely not a Republican but I'm also not a Democrat I focus more on the people anyway)Throughout the rest of the show a lot of men except about 4 or 5 are evil and cannot be trusted and politics keep being thrown in I hope there isn't another episode about a specifically Republican Male out to destroy everyone because that goes against the whole equal and unified premise of the show but overall good acting witty comments and well thought out villians make a good show (except for the absence of Superman during MAJOR parts of the fight with world killers while Kara is basically being brutally attacked) so watch and hope they get less bias as I'm all for equality but not for bashing people and one sided opinions and I love the overall message of the show.",

It definitely had its cheesy moments, and it took me a while to get over how stark of a difference this \"sunny\" version of Kara was from the dark, more tortured soul Kara in the actual comics. But overall, it was entertaining enough. And then Season 2 happened...Season 2 was turned into a bad romance soap opera saga with little character development for Kara and the incessant shoving of the non- heroic Mon-El in our faces. Those familiar with the comics already know that the Mon-El depicted in the show is nothing like the Mon-El we know from the comics. Not only that, but he and Kara never had a romance. I get that these shows aren't going to follow the comics every time. But why were we given a sexist, disrespectful frat boy version of Mon-El in a show that likes to tout itself as being \"feminist?\" Because there was absolutely nothing feminist with how Mon-El treated Kara throughout Season 2. Frankly it was insulting to watch their poor excuse of a \"romance\" play out when he did nothing buy disrespect her, disregard her advice, spew out sexist after sexist comment, and argued with her incessantly. It was flat out gross to watch. Kara didn't grow as a character in Season 2. Instead she got dragged down by Mon-El and was reduced to being the love interest even though she's supposed to be the main character of her show just so that a spoiled man-child could be propped up as \"heroic.\" Which, by the way, Mon-El never once proved he was a hero. Instead we were just told over and over that he was and that he had changed without any physical storytelling proof. There were so many plot holes that were never resolved. One good thing Season 2 had going for it was the CADMUS story line. But that never played out. Katie McGrath's Lena Luthor was really the only character that kept my watching. And unfortunately, I don't think she will be enough to keep me watching Season 3 since the powers that be think that Mon-El is an awesome character and will continue to be a part of Supergirl. No thanks. Here's a clue, heads of CW, Supergirl show runners and writers, just because two actors are dating each other, it doesn't mean a bad story line that has gotten plenty of media and fan backlash is \"the right story to tell.\" But have fun continuing to lose viewers with that way of thinking. Because I, for one, won't be tuning in to see more of the Mon-El show!",

Putting down Superman in previous seasons was bad enough... as if she could beat him... LOL... he has more experience, he's stronger than her (he's a man, it's physics people - most of the time it's true) and yet she beat him. I gave it a pass for the most part because it is her show but in reality... a laughable statement.Season 4 started going downhill despite the interesting back story... too much PC garbage just ruins the show and makes you think \"oh for .... sakes why did they ruin it with that comment?\"I try and ignore it, but when it's so \"in your face\" and not true it just pulls you out of the show.I wouldn't even bother buying Season 4 but the first 3 seasons are pretty decent overall. I've heard season 5 is even more PC but I will wait and see.How about GOOD QUALITY writing. A good writer can teach any lesson without it being obvious. Writers today are not how writers of the 70's, 80's, 90's were like.I hope season 5 isn't ruined and I'm trying my best to enjoy season 4. It has promise but so far it seems to be pushing the typical garbage that has been responsible for killing many shows.

I mean, really.....she's on the edge of going into \"mean girl\" territory. She's already got the \"I'm better than you\" attitude going full blast. A smart alec attitude I might add, that makes her more easily hated than liked. She has been confronted many times about being biased and self-righteous, and throws a tantrum because she thinks she just so perfect, that she is above everything and everybody.And her egotistical attitude doesn't show any signs of subsiding. She doesn't show any signs of growing or even expanding her mind to even try to understand other peoples feelings and emotions. It's just \"me, me, me\".This show is more about a spoiled brat than it is a show about a benevolent, understanding hero.If you are bored with nothing better to do. Watch this.

I thought this was a show about superheroes. I get they are going for the diversity, (i.e. black Jimmy Olsen, female villains and strong female characters) but I don't need it hammered in. I have many homosexual friends, but if they were to come over to my house every night and talk about their relationship issues and make out in front of me all the time it would get a little old. Same with my hetero friends.Every episode is also about the poor aliens -creatures that are so technologically advanced they have managed to make their way to this planet and remain largely undetected but then immediately become so weak and good and helpless (read illegal immigrants) that evil humans are determined to drive them out for evil reasons. That is the entire 2nd season in a nutshell.Jimmy Olson becomes a superhero himself with the worst voice ever? And where does he disappear to?

This is what I feel is really going on here.In my view, the main reason so many people are hating Supergirl is because they're used to having the title character grow up in Superman's shadow. She'd always been \"Superman's cousin,\" never really given her own way to grow up into the character.Sure, having her stuck in the phantom zone was a bit of a stretch, but going with the continuity of having her grow up, basically, on Earth as a younger cousin, because, as it says in the pilot, time doesn't pass in the PZ, gives her something that no other Supergirl had before.Before, she was always someone who followed in Superman's shadow, someone who was just thought of as a female Superman. Now, Supergirl is her own character, written in such a way that she's growing into who she is supposed to be. She is a full hero in her own right, not just a girl who's like Superman.As per her connection to James Olson, there is no reason at all that she and James can't have that kind of relationship. It shouldn't matter at all, for any reason, that James can be in the story in the way he is.If you're looking for a female Superman, or if you're saying that it can't be good if it doesn't follow one of the \"established story lines,\" then you will be disappointed. But, if you want to see a story of a female superhero who is growing into herself, learning about what she can do while facing the same fears and doubts that every woman feels at some time in their lives, and wondering who she really is, just like every person has ever felt, someone who definitely isn't Superman but can exist without his influence, then this show might be worth the watch.",

            "review_title": "Season Four was very much disjointed",
            "content": "So, Season Four has ended. And while I did not expect much, I'm still sort of bummed that this season did not deliver what I expected (I know, some sort of an oxymoron). When you take the story of Season Four as a whole, you will see that much of the things portrayed therein were pretty much pointless. Starting from the Red Daughter sub-plot and, perhaps, ending with Alex wanting a baby sub-plot, while, in the latter's case, it was really pointless.First major example, for about 95 percent of the season we haven't heard anything about the adoption process, and towards the end episodes Alex receives a phone call from the agency, telling her that a teenage mother, who is having a baby, chose Alex to take care of the baby. But where did this plot point go? Absolutely no where, cause the would be mother changed her mind and Alex was left feeling sad for not having the chance to be a mother.Second major example, the mind-wiping (alteration) of Alex in order to keep the secret identity of Kara a secret. At this point, the secret identity is very much a running-gag, but let's bite the bullet. There was only one episode where mind-wiping had any significance (and it was where Colonel Hailey was using the Truth Seeker on DEO agents, as well as Alex, in order to find-out who knows about Supergirl's normal identity). Other than that, the mind-wiping story-line served no purpose, cause in the end, Col. Hailey was not the bad-guy she was gradually portrayed to be, the quest for finding-out the true identity of Supergirl stopped abruptly for other storyline (mainly, the Red Daughter, Agent Liberty and Lex Luthor story-line) and this sub-plot was only dragged out in order to create some sort of an artificial tension between Kara and Alex, as well as to introduce a side-kick for Kara, which would have eventually replaced Alex, in my opinion. In other words, again, pointless.Third major example, Red Daughter story-line. At first, I thought that it would have so much potential, but as many other sub-plots, it went nowhere pretty fast. I have to congratulate Melissa Benoist on her acting as a USSR-esque trained super solder, but that's about it what was interesting in the RD sub-plot. As Lex Luthor's character said to Red Daugther in the last episode (paraphrasing): if you hadn't been such an idiot and actually googled me, you would have seen who you are working for. The RD sub-plot started with Lex training her to hate America, as well as Supergirl, and ended with RD figuring out that Lex is the bad guy (because Lex tried to kill her and/or torture her) and sacrificing herself to save Supergirl. Again, no real build-up, just rush-rush-rush through the story-line. Really, anti-climatic, especially when you think about that RD was not even the main villain this season.I could go on and on about pointless sub-plots, but I'll just leave it at that.The main story-line. Did I like it? Not so much. Mainly because of the fact that the writers lack knowledge and experience on how to write compelling stories reflecting real world problems without appearing like they are trying to bash you over the had with it. Much of the dialogues about the danger that illegal aliens pose was corny and eye-roll worthy. To think that they could have taken a page from Mao, Stallin, Hitler or Musollini's speeches, but decided to speak like a second grader speaks about these issues (humans good - aliens bad) is laughable. Also, another thing, which is laughable is that how quickly this season people hated and forgave their heroes. In a blink of an eye, without anyone questioning anything, they started hating Supergirl and applauding Agent Liberty, and then Lex, and just as fast they turned away from the latter and started to revere Supergirl again. There was no grey line portrayed this season. Just white and black.Anyways, there are much more issues, but I don't feel the need to point them out (cause this review is long enough as it is). I give this season a solid 5.5 / 10. At least, all of this political refugee issues finally ended. And the next season will have something else to show (hopefully).",

Yet she still manages to retain the fun/light and very strong aspects of her character which shine thru. Melissa is doing a awesome job on the Kara front and settling in to the role of Supergirl even better than I anticipated and I had high expectations from the get go.At this point I have edited my review to reflect the shows direction 4 years on. Some reviews are unfair because all they focus in on is the feminist message. I do think the show writers take a wrong approach there as it isn't necessary with Supergirl. Does not need to be overstated as it speaks for itself. Aside from that though the series continues to show a great deal of promise with a exceptional cast dragged kicking and screaming on the back of it's charismatic lead. Benoist is this show. She plays Kara to perfection and continues to accurately portray the many different sides of Super Girl. Glad to hear there will be a season 5!!!",

She complains the whole episode about how the city has lost faith in her, and in the end she can't beat even one of the villains, the civilians have to do all the heroics for her, and yet they still somehow find it in their hearts to forgive her. For a feminist show they're doing a terrible job. The other thing I can't get over is the complete and total rewrite of Jimmy Olsen's character. Look, I get that casting black actors in white roles is something that happens now, but that isn't even my main complaint about Jimmy. They renamed him James Olsen, and turned him from a dorky shy camera boy, to a suave, debonair ladies man with (supposedly) heaps of sex appeal. This is not Jimmy Olsen. If they wanted a character like that, they should have just created a new one. Overall, I'd give Supergirl a 0/5 if I could.",

Supergirl did not even stand up for herself but instead caved...because everyone is supposed to automatically agree that Guantanamo = bad. Never mind that it's not her department (she's not in charge). She doesn't own the lock-down which is run by the government to secure dangerous aliens. Never mind that she can't shut it down and should not be responsible for releasing anyone, she completely was blamed.Ultimately in the story she was the one that had to act. She releases a dangerous criminal to the streets because holding him even with the 'room full of criminal case files against him' was \"wrong\". OK, I'm willing to stipulate that holding US citizens without due process is wrong.. but you don't do what our president does and release dangerous people to the streets to make a political statement. They need to be tried and if convicted go to prison. That's what you do with US citizens who break the law and for whom you have collected a preponderance of evidence to convict. Notice they did not address the alien terrorists which there evidently were quite a few. Can you imagine the disaster releasing alien terrorists to the streets would cause? Yep they didn't address this because even they know this would be a no win for them.It's a minor point but it's enough to be annoying.

Kara's boss is a smug New York City brat and who thinks she's genetically gifted and better than everyone else when in reality she is just as ugly outside as she is inside. Kara, the nerdy office assistant who is super girl is sooo needy of everyone's help and approval. Like really? You have super powers and you act like that?! They never have appearances of superman himself just dialogue of him having been at certain scenes or mentions of him. Overall the show is way too tacky, the acting is overthetop dramatic and emotions are forced. You can totally tell that the show is driven by feminist propaganda and it really kills the vibe of the comic series. It's a shame that in our day and age we have to have liberalism shoved down our throats. This show is so bad that I probably won't watch it after the first season. It's just too unrealistic and fake. And not just the acting. OK I take it back, I hate her boss in this show.",

Her sister, Alex, works for the Department of Extra- Normal Operations; I really have nothing else to say about her sister, I just wanted to say the phrase \"Department of Extra-Normal Operations\", because it has to be the most lazily written and stupid name ever. And then there's Kara's boss, Cat Grant \u2013 this character is embarrassingly bad. It's like the writers Googled \"female archetypes\" and just went with it.

            "content": "Supergirl had so much potential to be a show women and young girls could really look to for strong, inspiring female characters and representation. Unfortunately, it failed miserably with that in Season 2, and Supergirl is definitely not someone I'd ever aspire to be as an empowered woman. What prompted me to get on here and do a review was the latest ridiculous defense of the one of the BIGGEST problems of the show...Mon-El, by one of the CW's top executives. Despite the known backlash of this character, he basically said that Mon-El will remain an integral part of Season 3 because the two actors that play Kara and Mon-El are dating in real life and that it's the \"right story to tell.\" Ummmmm...okay, really? So the right story to tell is one of letting a complete misogynistic, disrespectful, egotistical poor excuse of a man get the girl (who happens to be the lead character) all while also completely taking over the story line so that most of the fandom kept referring to Supergirl as \"The New Adventures of Mon-El?\" And you should keep Mon-El on the show because the actor is dating the lead actress? Yikes! Talk about being out of touch with just how much Mon-El was disliked as a character. It's no secret that I despise Mon-El's character. The way the writers continually allowed Kara to be berated and disrespected by him was very offensive and not at all what the Kara from Season 1 would have put up with, especially if she had still been with James. Speaking of James...an overly glossed over point it seems is how they abruptly did away with the Kara and James relationship for no apparent reason and then immediately had her get with a white boy who used to own slaves. So...apparently the writers also don't have a problem with slavery and the racist undertones that had. Just another lovely tidbit...which I see other fellow reviewers have also commented on. The \"right story to tell\" also involved Mon-El telling Winn after Kara still wouldn't get with him that he missed being on Daxam where he could objectify women and just not care. THAT'S they kind of character you want representing your show? Well guess what, that's not what I want to watch. And I won't be tuning in for Season 3. Oh, and the endless political propaganda that I spoke of in the title, that pretty much speaks for itself in most of Season 2. I have no party affiliation. It was just annoying to be continually beaten over the head with the writers' political views. The CW's version of Supergirl is not something to be proud of...unless the writers, producers, and network executives are proud of propping up a horribly written male character that undermined the leading female character and essentially took over her show. If that's that what they were going for, then kudos to them for turning what could have been an empowering, strong female character into an unrecognizable, shell of a girl who is by no means any kind of super heroine I'd want to look to for inspiration as a woman.And I'll just leave it at that, because if I get started on the lazy writing and major plot holes that never got resolved, this review will become a novel!",

For example, in season two, Kara has to save a train from falling to it's destruction (you see the same thing in Superman: The Movie), but what is different here is that when she is holding the rails together she has trouble,struggles, but when Superman did the same thing then, he did it with ease. And it gets to tell us that Kara is Stronger than Superman, count me not convinced. And on top of that, the interactions don't feel as natural as \"The Flash\" for instance.

Whilst I find some of the plots to be a little flimsy, I can live with the fact the program is not too heavy and I can watch in the knowledge that I won't be exposed to unwarranted gore or sex, because I can get that elsewhere.What does irritate me though, is how SG seems to be beaten at every turn by the villain of the week. She gets knocked through buildings, smashed into the floor, dragged out of the air and almost killed on a regular basis. Now I understand that futuristic or off-world tech plays a part in this but getting bettered by Livewire and Silver Banshee is unfeasible, given that they are literally fighting a being with god-like power. Same in season 2 Ep.5, where a regular guy with an alien 'ray gun' zaps her out of the sky while she is flying at super speed. I mean, come on! The guy is an earthling and would not see her coming.I can live with the PC story lines and feminine power because they are something good and worthwhile, especially for younger viewers...but SG's power needs to be unleashed a bit more convincingly.

I'm okay with touching on current events and issues, writing shows structured around current headlines whether that involves gay marriage, alzheimers, gun control, etc and creating backstories to fit before jumping to ridiculous conclusions got old about 1/2 way through the first of these innumerable episodes. Weak, simpering, conflicted, whiny heroes that spend the majority of their time getting spanked across the small screen provide a priceless glimpse into the failed ROM-COM heads of the team of writers that seem intent on getting this one cancelled.What could work well with this show:The actors make the best of what they have to work with. If the writing could turn around I expect they could turn this into a series memorable for something more than butchering a strong franchise.Special effects are okay on a TV budget.If they pick a theme(dark, light, campy, or whatever) this could be a decent show...which brings me right back to the POTENTIAL.\nAll in all, free on Netflix and worth what you paid as long as you don't have to watch the commercials.

For once, female characters get to rule and the boys get to sit on the sidelines. After watching Arrow, Flash, Gotham, Agents of SHIELD and Agent Carter with great interest, I can say that only Flash and Agent Carter have held my interest from episode to episode and improved with each.Supergirl started out as corny and a rip off of Superman (pick any movie or TV series) however I enjoy how it keeps the show character driven and is ultimately about Kara's journey. For a girl who was sent off by her mother just as she was turning 13 (the start of some very tough years for both genders), Kara has so much to learn. And you can see that in episodes 1,2,3,4... yes all of them. No matter how much time she's spent here, she's still an alien in the truest sense and unless she's forced to learn something new and evolve, she just seems to exist and float around - not really living.I also like how the show is obviously feminist. They are not trying to hide it. Calista Flockhart as Cat Grant has possibly the best lines on the show and never fails to deliver. Chyler Leigh as Alex is the big sister who shifts from being overly protective to being downright mean at times. But then this is how any 'sister' relationship would be if after 15 years of being an only child you get a super sister. And last of all Laura Benanti in the role of aunt Astra / mom Alura is just brilliant. Their latest showdown in 'Ep 8- Hostile Takeover' was absolute perfection. Fight scenes were well done (yes we could all see there was a hidden agenda), confrontations & flashbacks with both Kara in Krypton & Earth with her aunt and mom were simply spectacular and well acted by both actresses.So whats not to love? You can tell the inner demons, family and workplace drama are enough to drive this show without having Kara fly around National City playing hero.I also like how the writers are staying true to characters created for this TV universe. For all future & past fans of the show, do not expect a comic book reincarnation. I'm glad they are not following any of it because really 90% of any super shows' audience do not read comics. So why not make it your own especially when you know its in its own 'pocket super hero universe'",

Now... if I'm willing to overlook this, at least, the writers should know that what made shows like \"Arrow\", \"The Flash\" and movies like Dark Knight and Man of Steel so successful, is the maturity of said shows, the darkness that is fully part of the DC universe, but NO.... its clear that this show is meant for teenagers that have little to no knowledge of the DC universe. An example? That Supergirl costume...... really??? After the amazing Superman, Flash, Green Arrow, Deathstroke, Batman (and I could go on) costumes fans got to see already on screen, they came out with something that could be easily found at Wal Mart..... the very concept of \"If it's not broken, don't fix it\" clearly was not taken in consideration at all. I'm willing to give the show a chance, but some serious changes are needed.....",

Jimmy Olsen is a nerdy cub reporter, not the strapping muscle bound stud James, and certainly not Supergirl's love interest. Also not sure which was worse, Supergirl only saving the plane after she saw that her sister was on it or her sister chastising her for not letting a plane full of innocent people die, including herself. And the head of her organization (who apparently knew of Supergirl's \"secret\" identity when she hired Alex since that's how she got the job) is an anti- Kryptonian bigot.Leaving aside that it seemed that Kara had pierced ears (tough to do on Earth, though I guess one could argue it was done on Krypton because they are so culturally similar to us) the strangest thing is how little she has to do with her own flesh and blood. If my cousin and I were the only Earthlings on another planet I think we would keep in touch, and I would certainly want his/her help if I were battling super aliens.",

I literally just finished season 1, and God its even worse. I love the whole equality feminism thing that they were trying (but obvi failed) they just really overdid it too much like 90% of the stuff just was too forced. Seriously, God is a she now... and a freaking woman president.... And, this show is super racist I swear those episode with Zhonn was literally breaking my heart. And that Kara and James thing I will never ship there is 0 chemistry in the mix at all. This show has no Latinos, no Asians no Indian no nothing except 2 black people and a billion while people wth so the whole city is a white place???? The fakish looking effects is awful. Storyline awful. Actors literally overacting smh. And, the self righteous crap is annoying.SPOILER ALERT...In episode 20 when Kara choose not to sacrifice 8% of the population to stop a major disaster. Just all in the name of hope... but, in arrow there were countless of times they had to do make extremely tough descions and still have hope. eg. when felicity had to redirect that bomb which was headed for their city.I also feel like there stealing other shows/movies ideas. example. 1x19 (myriad) when everyone minds gotten taken over... (DIVERGENT) and then Indigo looks a hell of a lot like Mystic.... AND LAST THE FREAKING BANSHEE.... TEEN WOLF!!!look I can go on all day on how awful this show is. I seriously hope it gets canceled mainly for the sexist content, bad material, racism and etc. I do not recommend watching this ever, even if you have a death wish.",

            "content": "I quite enjoyed \"Supergirl\" for the first few seasons. The longer it went though, the more it fell into the same narrative traps that the other Berlanti-Verse shows have done and the less interested I was.Kara Danvers (Melissa Benoist) is a bashful reporter for Catco Publishing in Central City. She is also an alien, who escaped the planet Krypton prior to its destruction and grew up on Earth, where the yellow sun gave her powers far beyond that of a normal human. Eventually deciding to use these powers to help the people of Central City, the decision puts her at odds with Kara's boss Cat Grant (Calista Flockhart), who is eager to expose Supergirl's true identity.For the first few seasons, I thought the show worked quite well. Melissa Benoist is a warm and engaging actress and the show spun a web of villains of the week, mixed with some over arching big bads and whilst it was never high art, it was as solid as it's contemporaries. There were nice references both to the rest of the Berlanti shows and the wider DC characters as well as some interesting meta moments, especially in the casting.I do think it fell down the same rabbit hole that \"Arrow\" and \"The Flash\" fell down too, in which the change from a Superhero with tech support from their friends, to a team of superheroes, where everyone has powers makes the show a lot less interesting. It removes the threat if they're all capable fighters with magic powers. Mostly though, my problem with Supergirl is that it got more complicated beyond the attention span I was prepared to give it. To be clear, I don't mean emotionally complicated, I mean convoluted. Certainly, with the final season, this was another one where I let it mount up on the planner, decided that life was too short and deleted it, just watching the finale.Though I don't regret all the time I spent with \"Supergirl\" ultimately, I don't think that I'd recommend anyone should start it now.",

Objectively, it is a lousy show, but I loved \"Beverly Hills\" in the '90s so this one fits me too.5,5/10After the second season, I have to improve rating from 6 to 7. It's still more naive and childish than other superhero shows, but it's constantly improving and becomes more fun. If we ignore lame musical crossover with \"The Flash\", which technically belongs to \"The Flash\" series anyway, the second season has no weak episodes. If you are a fan of dark and serious superheroes, like Nolan's Batman, this will look silly to you, even stupid, but if you like classic approach to superheroes like they originally were, \"Supergirl\" will not disappoint you.7/10",

I hate having to stop watching a good show because of it.I like to see such a thing as a female hero. There are many females who are heroes in the real world, except they're not usually knocking out teeth to be such. However, this modern feminism propaganda is excessive. This show clearly illustrates the nature of it. Today's feminism is about reversing the roles, and women hating men, or at least insulting them to the infinitive degree. It doesn't help sexism, it just makes it worse, and gives men an excuse to be the brutes that feminists women proclaim them to be, though there is never a good excuse for such, regardless.I stopped watching because of the political agendas, especially the homosexual issues. I don't want there to be any confusion: many people are ceasing to watch good shows like this BECAUSE of this issue. It is causation, NOT correlation for declining viewership.

In a word, it was terrific. I found the character of Kara/Supergirl a nice mixture of young woman with hopes and fears along with more power and drive within her than she had realized. Melissa Benoist was amazing--she did really well playing the divided character of a low- key human and this emerging superhero. I liked the power and joy of her first take off to fly, trying more than once to get off the ground, and how her face changes when she is flying to where she is needed. I liked Smallville, but this isn't Smallville nor should it be. It is a different kind of show with a lot more comic book action it it and a different kind of storytelling. I liked the characters, especially Kara's sister and her obnoxious boss. Both of them were multi-dimensional--not all good or bad--and I think in the future we will see a lot more interesting things from them. The villains are sooooo evil as to be one-dimensional, but hey, it is comics, not Shakespeare. We'll have to watch for more development in the future.I have to mention the change of Jimmy Olsen from a freckled redhead to a tall, gorgeous African American man played by Mehcad Brooks. It jarred me at first because it was so unexpected, but by the end of the show I was a total fan. We don't need another young guy learning the ropes when Supergirl is the one doing that in this series. Interesting choice that works for me, but might not work for everyone. All in all, I thought the show was terrific. And I was not alone in this. I started watching it alone, but by the end of the show both my husband and son had joined me and were engrossed. It was a hit for all of us. I highly recommend Supergirl!",

I'm just waiting for the episode which concentrates on mean tweets. Most people watch comic book series to get away from the real world, we don't want it thrust even further down our throats.Throw the political correctness in with some pretty average acting and boring love interest story lines and it surprises me that this show hasn't been pulled yet (especially when far better super hero shows like Luke Cage have been been binned).

Unlike quite a few other reviewers who trashed this show on the basis of the pilot only, I decided to see how the show and characters progressed. This is basically a reboot of the Supergirl story. The pilot was not the best that I have seen but I must say that it is improving as it goes on. The characters are maturing and the story lines are passable but not great.While reading through previous reviews, I was stunned by some of the very negative comments. Some people criticized the show because it does not follow the historic comic book story lines but they then compare it unfavourably to The Flash and Arrow, neither of which follow the comic books either. So why condemn this show but praise the other 2 ? Considering the original Supergirl was set in the 1950's & 60's it is not surprising that the producers decided to update the whole thing to the current era, after all Jimmy Olson would now be at least 75 years old (a bit old to be a photographer for a modern magazine) and changing him to an African-American is not such a hard thing to come to terms with considering how racist the comic book was (the vast majority of non-Caucasians were villains and nearly all humanoid heroes were Caucasian).I am enjoying this version of Supergirl and was very pleased with the choice of actors for her adoptive parents, great nod to past shows.

            "content": "Okay, here goes my opinion in it's full form: first half of the series( and if we make 1 and 10 episodes better or delete theme, the other 8 together are surprisingly solid). The other half is a complete trash, two last episodes of s1 worst of all. I liked cast and actors, i liked characters, their relationships and development in first half again, but the other staff is failed. Effects & staging - bad from the start, cheap episode( and universe) formula - partly in the first half, fully in the second half(things goes so bad that even Flash can't save the day). Well, you know, several times when i watched the bad show, like 1 season i rated whole show(because of all people IMDB doesn't have season rating(disgusting system)) and it seems not cool to rate the whole show by one season, but, here is my solution and logic: if your starting season is bad, and it is so bad, that it makes you drop the show, ignoring bright spots, sometimes big spots, than it is fair rating to your show. That's why GoT has 1 star from me, cause i couldn't even sit through couple of episodes, yet later i watched the full show, and enjoyed couple of lines, bunch of the series( considering how GoT overrated and hyped, and how many weak spots it has it deserves 1 star anyway). You can't just say to people, that cool staff starting i don't know after 100 episode, nobody gonna watch that. Just think about it: i wasted 40 minutes on every of 20 episodes of this show, for what? To get fair disappointment in the end? And i say to you even more, i knew that getting something interesting of this show with 99% probability would be a problem, but i started it, watched couple of episodes and it was cool, but at the same time i realized that good line don't last forever and it may be replaced by the bad line of episode just inside this season. And you know what? It happened. And i was thinking to drop that on like 12th episode, you know, just because don't like it anymore, but i know that fans of shows like that would never get you serious if you for example didn't finished the show and share your opinion( i drop things only they start melting my brain and even in that case not always), so i lived through another 8 empty episodes just to have a right to go into the crowd of supergils and tell them how bad the show that they liked. And i'm not happy about how bad this show, i loved the characters, i'd gladly watch cool episodes with them, but it's just not worth it, to spend another 14 hours on show, with Power Rangers Episode Formula, that MAYBE will entertain you for like 40% of episodes( in the best case)?",

            "content": "I'll admit it wasn't terrible, but the first episode gradually got worse as it progressed. I'm not going to go over specifics, but here are the problems I have with the \"Supergirl\" so far:1) Melissa Benoist:Since was one of the few actresses who was looked at for the role, even though she doesn't have a creditable filmography, it was most-likely because she's blonde. She clearly didn't do that great of a job playing \"Kara Danvers\" (even though the actual alias of Kara Zor-El is Linda Lee Danvers) or as Supergirl. While her clumsiness and being a typical office intern is a decent disguise at first, it doesn't last long when she decides to show off her powers to the guy at the office who tries to ask her out on a date. It would've made more sense if the two had chemistry for a good 4-5 episodes, he soon develops suspicions of her alter-ego, causing him to figure out that she is Supergirl. On top of that, she treats her \"heroism\" almost like a game and doesn't understand the weight of her role as a heroine. She also doesn't bother to get superheroine training (so she would know how to be one and use her powers effectively) and throws together a crappy costume and claims that makes her Supergirl (instead of having her costume come with her in her pod). Any superhero(ine) would have trained themselves, or got training from a master, and she gets defeated multiple times as a result. Clearly she wasn't a good choice.2) The rest of the characters are out of character:While Allura seemed okay, Jimmy Olsen isn't nerdy like he is the comics (and he's a photographer for the Daily Planet, not an art director for some company that doesn't have any relation to the comics), and Kat Grant is a narcissist who now supposedly owns her own media company. Superman only makes a cameo, and you'd think he would've shown up when he heard Kara had saved the people on the plane. The rest of the other characters have no back story, and seem like they're just thrown into the episode so the writers could add more characters.3) The show barely follows the comics:It seems like the people who made the show decided to simply plaster Supegirl's name on it, and acted like they knew the character. Just like the 1998 Godzilla movie, they were more interested in the title, not the character. I don't know what kind of drugs they were on to think it would be a good idea for Fred and Edna Danvers (who are now named \"Jeremiah\" and \"Eliza\") to only have a cameo, and instead have some made up sister named Alex has a lot of screen time. I also don't know why there's supposedly some secret government organization that deals with alien invasions. The writers could only be on cocaine if they thought that was good idea.4) It's \"fun\" and \"light-hearted\", instead of being epic and deep:Regardless of what your opinion about Man of Steel is, the people who made that movie portrayed Clark Kent/Superman as a powerful god-like being. Nowhere is there an understanding of that in Kara's character, or in the episode itself. If that was included in the episode, and Kara had to make several hard choices in the episode, she would understand her role as a superheroine, because of the emotional weight it bares on her, and it would make her character more likable. It would also make the show more grounded instead of flimsy and quickly thrown together.I'm not here to promote anything, but these reasons and more are why I immediately thought of making my own version so I can improve it. I'm not one of those people who rant about a show or movie, and then allow the idiots and Hollywood continue to run rampant. As a member of the audience, I'm entitled to stand up to Hollywood if they're going to act lazy, greedy, or careless.

            "content": "I stopped watching this show when it began pushing a gay agenda but have bounced back for just one episode in the latest DC crossover miniseries event.DC have introduced a crossover concept where some of their characters from different shows get together for a miniseries of usually 4 episodes, mainly because 4 different shows are involved. The story-line usually arcs through the 4 different shows one episode at a time. Now the shows can make for entertaining viewing and to explain what happens in more detail it is necessary to understand that DC use a multiverse approach which means the Supergirl characters are in one universe and the characters from Arrow are in another and so on. But they all get together by some of them coming through a portal.This is very important to understand the consequences this has for the Supergirl show. To get to the other characters she has to travel through a portal. And now we come to November 2017 and the DC crossover episodes for \"Crisis on Earth-X\", the fourth annual Arrowverse crossover event. And the first episode to kick it off was you guessed it, from Supergirl!*******************WARNING SPOILERS BELOW********************************So Supergirl travels through her portal, bringing along her human sister, Alex. As the episode develops, Alex ends up snogging and having a gay encounter with the female captain of the Waverider time traveling group. OK the full episode is entertaining TV but when you sit down and analyze what just happened it gets disturbing. And I mean really disturbing. And I mean especially for Supergirl fans!Here's the problem. Apparently Alex has had some sort of bust up with her female gay lover and that sort of leaves her usual gay activities that have been occurring each Supergirl episode on hold. So here's this crossover miniseries where the heroes all get together to fight some Nazi threat from another Earth. And Alex comes along for the ride? Why? There is only one possible answer. To have a snog and gay encounter with the female captain of the Waverider. And this is where it gets disturbing. On just what premise did Supergirl bring Alex along? Well the background story was a wedding so this was used to bring Alex along.And there it is.The whole background story for the first episode of \"Crisis on Earth-X\" has really been constructed so that Alex could come through the portal with Supergirl and continue her gay snogging adventures!This means that the gay agenda behind Supergirl is now completely the driving force behind story construction for this series. Ouch!And this is clearly a very curious direction that this show has taken.And a very curious update for December 5There is definitely something going on here. I have now finished viewing the rest of the miniseries: \"Crisis on Earth-X\" and I can't but help make the following observations:The episodes are definitely entertaining viewing but there does appear to be a very subtle underlying theme here.One Supergirl fan has written that the show is \"The finest propaganda you'll ever see\" and the fact that the Nazis were experts at propaganda links in very well with this miniseries.When some of the heroes are taken to Earth-X and find themselves in what is clearly a Nazi concentration camp it is very telling that one of the prisoners they interact with is a gay person wearing a pink triangle. These were used to denote homosexual men as a Nazi concentration camp badge. In fact, he was the only prisoner they interacted with. Give that a little bit of thought. When asked what he had done wrong, he stated that he had loved the wrong person.In real life, the Nazis did incarcerate gay males as one group to be eliminated. The United States Holocaust Memorial Museum states of homosexuals, that \"hundreds, possibly thousands (possibly also counted in part under the 70,000 repeat criminal offenders and so-called asocials\" were killed.Then we are introduced to a gay couple who are part of a resistance movement and they are fighting for their existence. Again, some gay people fighting the nasty Nazis.The subliminal message from this miniseries is clear: if you are not supportive of the gay movement, then you are just as nasty as the Nazis.So it appears that even the Nazi story-line may have been added to send some sort of a gay message.Now I know there are some pretty crazy conspiracy theories out there, but there really is something going on here.The level of subtlety and style of propaganda being used here to push a gay agenda is just astounding. In fact, though he was obviously not a supporter of the gay movement, I am sure that Joseph Goebbels, the head of Nazi Propaganda, would have been extremely impressed with the writers of this show.And by now, I hope that even the most somnolent Supergirl fan must be wondering, just what in the world is going on here?And just what are we watching, really?",

            "content": "I really want to like this show. It has some great moments and a likable lead. That's the good side, now for the darkside:1) Please, please, please try to keep the plot holes from multiplying like rabbits on a diet of Viagra. Example: the first episode where Supergirl meets her evil aunt, she thinks she is her mother, but learns in a bit of \"evil guy dialog\" that she is her aunt that she was never told about. A few episodes later we find out that Kara and her aunt were once the best of buds... what the Hell. 2)Preach it baby. This show is very much in tune with women rule and boys drool, especially white boys. ALL the major villains are white guys full of \"white privilege\". General Lang, Mr. Lords, Nom(the real Kryptonian villain as his wife - Kara's aunt - is really a good person inside), the Trickster, all evil white guys. The heroes are selected from a college course on women and minority studies. I have no problem with heroes being of whatever color or gender. I do have a problem when the show gets preachy about how white guys are evil and stacks the deck in such a way that it is painfully obvious. The only sympathetic white guy is a nerd and even with that his dad is evil. 3) Too much suspension of belief. Not the lasers coming out of Supergirl's eyes. The fact that she would love her job working for Han Solo's wife (Flockart)who plays an utterly detestable character who has the heart of the Grinch, Donald Trump's narcissism and Hillary Clinton's bitchy I can do no wrong attitude. Sometimes it is funny how over the top she plays the role, reminds me of Shatner's acting skills. 4) Why are they ruining the role of Jimmy Olsen? In NO universe is Jimmy a highly confident tall muscely black man. Where is the awkward red head with freckles. I'm sure they did this because this show is more concerned with appeasing the PC gods (see #2). Sad that they could not be a bit truer to the source material. Will I keep watching the show, maybe. I do get tired of the disjointed plots and every show learning about how evil white guys are, but it does at times redeem itself. They better move their low bar a little higher and soon.",

Each season has something good about it but generally almost everything is just ok to bad. In season 1 the characters and Supergirl learning her powers was interesting. Max Lord was the more interesting villain but Astra was ok too. However Non was terrible. In season 2 the idea of supergirl training another hero was interesting and Lena was an interesting addition but I was not a fan of Mon-El, and the Daximites were really underpowered. In season 3 Reign was good and one of the more interesting villians but the rest of the season was really boring. Season 4 was really political which was not good at all. That said the back half where Alex didn't know Kara was Supergirl anymore was interesting and the Lex Luthor plot was the best from the whole show. Again, the story in season 5 was dumb but the mid-season mini plot with Winn was good. I dont know why the writers think shoving politics in the plot is a good plan. I guess its might be sort of admirable to use your platform for social change but doing this in 1 or 2 episodes and showing both sides would have worked better. TV is an escape not a news article. Overall this show deserves a 7 because the actors are really talented. Melissa Benoist especially but Chyler Leigh and David Harewood are also really talented. The writers are terrible but the show is ok and really good when the writers step it up so you know the actors are really bringing it.",

She'll wait 5 seconds for a weapon that can harm her to charge, and give its wielder time to fire, despite him not being more than two metres away from her. She'll hover above perpetrators wreaking havoc so as to give them the opportunity to spot her and fire at her, rather than just go in and take care of business.She has also lost any and all reflexes she may have once had.

Instead, they decided to make the protagonist as flat as possible while still managing to be annoying enough to make you want to grind your teeth together for the entire episode. On top of all of this, the graphics are awful, the plot lines are reused, and the dialogue sounds like it was written by a team of sixth graders.

Kara is a great role model for young girls. Standing up for others, being there for your friends, always seeing the best in everyone.

But by giving her ordinary human qualities the writers and producers have created a character that is much more 3 dimensional than any of the past shows and movies. She can be a klutz, she has a temper, she makes all kinds of mistakes in judgment, she hasn't yet learned how to handle all of her powers and much more. And the real kicker is her human stepsister worker for the secret agency that manages and controls her and other aliens, good as well as bad. The other fun character is the head of the company \"Kara\" works for, as played by Calista Flockhart. Reminds me a lot of Perry White, except female, thin, and younger.

Regardless of the audience you're trying to attract, you have to start being more realistic. \nLack of realism: Supergirl is pushing a car towards Metallo. He pushes back. Suddenly he looks up and Supergirl is standing on top of the car staring at him. DOING ABSOLUTELY NOTHING. Just looking down at him and waiting for him to blast her. Where is the realism? Did you just get lazy when it came to that part of the fight? It looks like Supergirl is just waiting for him to cower in fear simply because she's glaring at him. \nLaziness: (1) The head of the DEO is Hank Henshaw, who is also J'onn J'onzz??? The creators of this show are that lazy that they couldn't just come up with a name for this particular character? Rather than create a character, you'll just totally change TWO established characters? J'onn J'onzz and Hank Henshaw are TWO DIFFERENT PEOPLE. J'onn has been around forever. Regarding Henshaw, look up an unknown (Insert sarcasm here) storyline from the 90s called \"REIGN OF THE SUPERMEN,\" which followed one of the most popular Superman storylines ever written, \"Doomsday.\" Stop being so lazy and create a new name. Not that hard. (2) Draaga. Part of another two very unknown (sarcasm again) storylines. The first is where Superman has exiled himself in space, Draaga was top gladiator on a planet that lived only for the gladiator fights. The second, he was part of the \"Panic in The Sky\" story where he gave his life because of his respect for Supergirl. Here he's been reduced to an alien on earth fighting underground. \nMon-el watches Supergirl get blasted by some high tech weapon. He walks up behind the guy, turns him around to face him...and just stands there to be blasted himself???\nOh, and not all Luthor's need to have the first name start with an \"L\". Knock that shi...stuff off.\nAnd stop having Supergirl walk with her hands/fists on her hips. It looks stupid.\nAnd this whole tension thing between Superman and John is just plain stupid. If anyone would understand J'onn keeping kryptonite as a defense measure, it's Superman. Through out all of Superman lore, one of his biggest fears has been that he might lose control and become a danger to earth. He once even gave Batman a kryptonite ring to use against him if necessary. That's intelligent mature writing.\nSo much advice to give but I'll keep it short. Grow up. Get some consistency. Look up the word realism in a dictionary. Stop being so lazy. \nThe best advice for anyone doing comic book superheroes, big screen or little, is watch Batman Begins. One of the main reasons that movie was such a success is because it was done in a way in which you could almost believe it could happen. Harder with Supergirl I know, but that should always be the goal. The attempt is not even being made here. Who knows what the goals here are, but whatever they are, this show is terribly done. My guess is that the only reason this show has lasted this long is because people like me want to see DC superheroes on TV so we keep watching, despite how terrible it is. And unfortunately, that gives high ratings, but also the incorrect appearance that the show is good, which it definitely is not. The only reason I gave it a 3/10 is because of the good special effects. AND READ YOUR REVIEWS. There are very few positive ones.",

Having been a comic fan as well as a fan of the George Reeves TV series and Christopher Reeve movie franchise, a hot Jimmy Olsen was initially jarring, but you know what? It's been done THE OTHER WAY for over 75 years, so why not try something different if it can be made to work?One sexist, clearly white male with a persecution complex has reviewed this series and asserted that this change is somehow racist against white people (I kid you not!!!) That's insane, paranoid bologna. This series, like the best, most beloved comic books have done through the decades, seeks to be inclusive and show the complex and nuanced nature of all characters - \"good\" and \"bad\" alike. While The Flash, though also optimistic and featuring some better writing, occasionally uses language that I don't want to hear as an adult (especially in a string of episodes centered around the character Hartley Rathaway/Pied Piper), never mind would I want my children hearing/using. The fact that Supergirl keeps it clean without avoiding a range of emotions and situations definitely earns it some extra points (and an extra star from me) allowing me to take it with a grain of salt.",

            "content": "It has been enjoyable following Supergirl's journey as she tries to manage her newfound persona and responsibilities, her relationships and her homesickness. HOWEVER, It feels like the writers have been slowly changing the indestructible woman into a walking, flying bundle of insecurities: SPOILER ALERT -* RELATIONSHIP WITH SISTER: Whereas it is wonderful to see the \"us against the world\" spirit and recognize its roots in Kara's loss of family and the love that binds her to her earthly family, her sulking over her sister going to a concert with her own new girlfriend, thus blowing Kara's Earth-birthday plans (which she hadn't bothered to share with anyone, mind you!) struck me as rather childish. This is a woman who lost her home planet and has had to live through the hardships of making a life on Earth! She ought to handle disappointments better than a 3 year old.* ROMANTIC RELATIONSHIPS: Whether with James and recently with Mon- El, there's this \"I want it - No, I don't want it - I like you a lot - No we can't be together\" back and forth to her romantic interests that will give you whiplash. Sure, it's understandable that being an indestructible crime-fighting alien who's only been on Earth for a decade or so, may make romantic relationships complicated; but that's not what comes out at all: they've made her into a woman who can't make her mind up on what she wants, if anything out of these relationships.Same thing actually happened with Alex who literally broke up and got back together with her girlfriend twice in an episode. Same thing happened again with J'onn and M'gann. * DISCONTINUITIES: The writers seem to be just as unsure about story lines as Kara is about her relationships: Is Mon-El a superhero in training or was that just to shoehorn in another romantic dead end for Kara? Whatever happened to Lucy Lane and her father? They were super involved in 1st season. Haven't heard from them since!* THE DISGUISE: Really, the difference between Kara and Supergirl are the glasses and the cape. Honestly, the fact that those around her haven't clued in, especially the super-shrewd Ms Grant defies even the suspension of belief you need to enter a DC Universe.CONCLUSION: It is wonderful that we are getting female superheroes, but rather infuriating that they can't be made into more than naive self-doubting bombshells, that only win every fight because the script says so. I'm sticking with the show, because I believe it really has some potential. I just hope the writers are able to explore the themes of alienation, responsibility, alter-egos and relationships in a way that rewards the viewers, especially female viewers, because I believe, worse than not being represented in the TV superhero pantheon, is being given a character that embodies all the not so flattering female stereotypes.",

            "content": "I'm not going to lie, I totally expected Supergirl to be a pale imitation of Superman, more a mascot for Girl Power and all that than an actually standalone superhero. She proves herself ten times over as someone who is fully capable of saving the world on her own.I was also wary of Melissa Benoist playing a superhero, as I have only seen her on Glee and was not sure she could pull off her role as Kara Danvers/Supergirl. Benoist more than meets the challenge and is adorable and perfect as both sunny and overly optimistic Danvers as well as tough-as-nails-Supergirl. My entire problem with this show is the writing. Supergirl/Danvers isn't always the most likable character and at times I find myself rooting for the so-called villain just to knock her off her pedestal she is perched on quite often. Her self-centered and selfish attitude comes off as a petulant teenager more often than not. She throws tantrums if things don't go her way, and she usually dismisses anyone who doesn't agree with her and does things her own way anyway. Teamwork is not Supergirl's strong suit. Yes, she's as capable as Superman on any given day, but her spoiled personality is more than a little off putting.What makes this show enjoyable is the supporting cast, especially Jeremy Jordan, David Harewood, and Chyler Leigh. Winn, Jonn, and Alex are three characters that make this show what it is. They're funny, kind, empathetic, and smart. They may not have Supergirl's prowess, but they are the true heart and backbone of this show. Calista Flockhart was a true gem and I was sad when she left the show as a series regular. I am more reserved about Mehcad Brooks, who makes James Olsen just about the most bland and unnecessary character on the show.If you can get past little annoying details like does Supergirl really need to over-exaggerate the shoving of her boobs EVERY SINGLE TIME she rips open her shirt or the billions of dollars of property damage that always seems to be immediately fixed (can we get that same construction crew to work on the highways in my state?), then this show is just a whole lot of mindless fun.

Trying to make Supergirl more relatable makes sense through subtle emotions and questioning how to deal with a situation, but NOT physical issues and certainly not fist fighting. Also, STOP grabbing scenes from the Christopher Reeve Superman movies. Instead of referring to the Superman movies for inspiration, I would ask the writers to refer to Adventures of Superman or Smallville. I don't care for the way Kara is written either. Stop the golly gee routine. Doesn't need to be as reckless as with the red K but the idea that she has to act like a bumbling goofball (like Reeve's Clark Kent) is insulting. We could do with a little less \"sisterhood\" chest pounding as well. They are grown adults working in life and death (at least Alex is) situations. If they were truly that emotional that agency would not have them involved. It makes no sense for completely human, vulnerable Al;ex to be braver and mentally stronger than Kara. When Alex is in danger, Kara should, like her sister (whom she grew up with and observed most of their life) simply focus on a plan to get her out of danger without having to emotionally proclaim \"she's my sister!\" Unless your show is intended just for little girls, PLEASE grow up.",

            "content": "The low score for this series is rather sad. DC finally gets it right, but of course, everybody wants something else... who knows what. Ignore the cynics: Supergirl excels on every count: casting, mood, visuals, character and even plot (typically DC's Achilles heel). As a bonus, it superbly captures that old-time DC feeling - without becoming either syrupy or campy.Some may argue that the series is too soft, too childish. That's absurd. There are lots of harsh events in this show - a number of brutal and very significant deaths, for a start. What critics are shying away from isn't childishness, it's *innocence*. Something that's out of fashion, much to the detriment of our entire culture.But that's exactly the theme here: innocence vs cynicism. Simplicity vs complexity. And, yes, good vs evil. We see the original 1959 Supergirl, facing ills that are essentially modern. She wants to fight evil without becoming part of an evil world, without losing the essential innocence that gives her her strength. That's a really powerful idea. It's what the best of us are trying to do every day: overcome the horrible problems facing our world, without becoming cynical, defeatist, negative (or *old*).It's what makes a hero: resisting evil not with a gun, or with your fists, but denying it with your very nature.Melissa Benoist is perfectly cast, as a very human young woman, unsure of her abilities, her social standing, her emotions - and yet both deeply caring and fundamentally tough. She out-shines every screen version of Superman by light years, because she actually has a strong personality - one that's depicted vividly, and which sits squarely at the core of all the stories.In a way, it might be fair to say that Supergirl is the 'chick-flick' of DC superhero shows. In the sense that it deals with emotion seriously, frankly, realistically. It never cops out with the make-believe angst of a show like Arrow. Instead, it shows us *genuine* affection between Kara and her sister, *genuine* friendship between Supergirl and Hank Henshaw. It shows us strong, painfully real emotions as they are sorely tested - but never bent or trivialized just for the convenience of a bonehead plot.Supergirl is far and away the best TV series DC has done so far (other than Gotham, of course, which isn't really a 'superhero' show), the one DC series that really has some dramatic meat on its bones. It's exactly because Supergirl succeeds as drama that it's able to present us with a super-heroine who's worthy of the name.I enjoy the other DC shows, but Supergirl is the only one that has me counting the days between episodes.UPDATE: As we near the end of Season Two, my admiration for this series is unshaken. The characters continue to ring true. The romantic relationships, which could easily be horribly over-done, instead feel plausible and remarkably genuine. And the action side remains resolutely true to the best 1950s DC traditions - a bit silly, a bit wacky, yet with a consistent logic that dodges the kind of incessant let-downs we've seen in Arrow and Flash.One example: a recent episode dealt with the idea of Supergirl being blackmailed by threats to one of her human friends. Flash has faced this situation multiple times, and has cravenly capitulated each time (usually giving up his super-powers, just to underscore what an idiot he is). Supergirl is told firmly that she *can't* negotiate with terrorists - and she doesn't. Instead, she finds an intelligent solution to the problem, that doesn't depend on mere super-muscle.Lesson: even silly super-heroics benefit from clever writing. Which Supergirl has in abundance, and the other DC shows (save Gotham) emphatically do not.",

Promised a female hero, and instead we get a whiny female teen who needs government handlers to tell her when to blast meaningless baddies Superman is conveniently too busy to handle with her eye lasers because apparently, she can't even make that decision without consulting with someone.Those are, by the way, my fianc\u00e9's words on the show. She absolutely loathes it. In fact, she watches Skorpion some nights, but will change the channel when Supergirl starts and change it back when its over.The problem is the writing. The show is really, really awful. The dialogue is cheesy; the villain of the week flavor structure is sad and renders any bad guy meaningless. Changing Jimmy Olsen the way they did also irked me, personally \u2013 not because they made him black \u2013 I could care less about the skin color of the actor \u2013 but because apparently, the bespectacled, somewhat clumsy yet lovable Jimmy Olsen somehow wasn't good enough for this cast. And let's not forget all that talking about FRIENDZONE\u0085. Seriously? Can this show be more immature than that? I'm not against memes, sometimes they can be fun, but to see grown ups talking about friendzone in the work place makes me think if the script for this show isn't actually being made by teens, who can't even read aloud what they're writing.Now about the female example of strong and independent woman, I think Supergirl isn't even trying. I would watch a show about Felicity Smoak alone, instead of Supergirl. She has the character, the presence and personality you hope to see in a fictional being, everything needed to make her more believable, while Kara \u2013 although I really like the actress herself \u2013 has even less personality than the heroes from Teen Titans cartoon.Oh, and one last thing: After watching Daredevil on Netflix and seeing the clever tie-in to the Marvel Universe used to explain his uniform, and how he went about getting, the lets-play-dressup method for the two person committee who designed Supergirl's costume in the pilot was laughably pathetic. It was, once more, my fianc\u00e9 who first pointed this out and I agreed with her immediately.",

            "content": "After yet another bad episode, I wonder: how long can this last? The writing is just so very, very bad. For Supergirl to give a speech in the middle of a fight is just mindless. I'm reminded of a scene in the movie 'Van Helsing,' when one of Dracula's vampire wives is going to kill the princess (Kate Beckinsdale), she taunts her, finally ending \"What do you think of that?\" And Beckinsdale's character stabs her with a pointy stake and responds, \"I think if you're going to kill someone, just kill them, don't talk them to death.\" THIS is how so many scenes in Supergirl are: punch, give a speech (usually, \"You don't have to do this\"), get knocked down/ thrown 100 feet away, get up, fly back, get punched again, fly out of the way just as the killing blow is about to be administered, then punch her adversary ______(fill in the villain) and end the fight. The Supergirl character is simply too dumb to be believable.Add to this the many DEO agents who, by now, must know her 'secret identity,\" if it can be called that, since, in the course of 4 episodes, at least 3 people learn of her identity, not to mention Maxwell Lord, who is far too smart to not put 2 and 2 together and realize she's related to \"Agent Danvers.\" Chalk this up to the writers, who write for a first grade level (no insult intended to the many (much) smarter 1st graders out there. One minute she's angry and the next scene, she's happy and smiling even though she she's had to watch someone killed/maimed/tortured. The recovery time of her emotions would work for a sociopath, but not the kindhearted human being she is. It's too weak for words. Speaking of weak, her powers are abominably poor for a 'Super Girl.' She's been on earth for a decade or so, yet can't even lift a plane finger, struggles to get out of quicksand,can't dodge a gun, fist, or bomb at all, and, just plain slow in her use of her powers. If she was in a boxing ring, she'd be out after the first round. I like Benoit, because I can see her goodness, but in something like Supergirl, to use Mae West's phrase: \"Goodness has(d) nothing to do with it.\"",

The main character acting as SuperGirl is really lame, I don't like her acting and her brooding over herself. Aside for that, the sexist trash here claiming that there's so-called 'feminist propaganda' or some garbage is a complete lie. It's an innocent show trying to promote power in females, which has been long suppressed and yada yada I won't go into those details and story about female oppression over centuries of Earth's existence. The show is promoting power in females and if someone has an issue with it, clearly THEY are the sexist ones. Some people complained that any male character 'against' supergirl is made evil - anyone with a brain can guess why. To be against someone who stands for good makes one the opposite of good, naturally. Sexist people who can't stand female power are trying way too hard to down the show with lies and excuses. How about just enjoy the show like you would enjoy it if it were Superman? Why are you picking on it because it has a female lead? Can you not stand power from the species that creates you and your life?Anyways, rant aside, the show itself could have been better if scenes were given more thought. Acting is not too well and it's not executed properly. Fight scenes are not impactful enough and sometimes supergirl is shown to be standing around like a moron during a fight. Something is just missing. I don't know why they did this. They were trying to show that at the start, she was just getting used to using her powers but they executed in a way that just made her seem lame.Bonus is that Supergirl actually has muscles. Finally, an actor who bothers getting muscles for the shoot.*7/10",

I usually can't pinpoint why or why not.I haven't read the Superman comics (or Supergirl comics, if they exist), so I'm sort of going in dry here.I'm only four episodes in but so far it's a fine superhero show. It's the newest in the DC series so it does feel like it's just the previous series rehashed and repurposed for Supergirls narrative. I guess it must have the same director since it seems to jam in a motivational speech in every episode which I absolutely hate from The Flash.As I said in the title, what I dislike is all the feminist stuff they tossed in. I have no problem with feminism as long as it's not being rammed down my throat. The fact that they had to keep repeating \"This is MY story, not SuperMAN'S, but SuperGIRL'S\" (paraphrasing) is just redundant. Oh, and during a pre-fight dialogue, they just casually threw in a line about them overcoming some sort of disagreement over one of them not voting for Hillary Clinton. It was that moment that motivated me to write this review.Why can't it just be a story about a superhero that happens to be a woman without constant references to her being a woman? Also, since she is from Krypton, like Superman, why does she seem so weak that normal HUMANS can take her by surprise? As I said I haven't read the comics but isn't Superman supposed to have superfast reflexes and speed? Why doesn't Supergirl have that?Also, why is there even mention of politics in a superhero show?

I wish them all the best - but I can honestly say I almost cried when I heard they would be ending with season 6. My only fault with the show is that at times the Star (Melissa Benoist as SuperGirl) was not shown enough. Too much time spent on co-stars and even though the show was called SuperGirl, with each season you were beginning to see less and less of the star.

In the pilot we see that Winn creates several different outfits for SG before they settle on one. Well there is no way he was sewing those outfits with that Singer 401 that was shown on his kitchen table! That machine would puke trying to run that fashion leather-weight material they used for SG's skirt. He should have been using a Singer 151 for any semblance of realism.

Reactron is roasting Supergirl, Superman shows up, does nothing about Reactron but brings Kara home and leaves! Oh, sure, the writers try to justify this with an erupting volcano somewhere but it just sounds hollow and false. If I saw my cousin being beat up I'd surely want to defend her, wouldn't you?

Watching it won't add anything to your life but on the opposite side, it won't take anything away either.The premise is interesting, and there aren't any Women led superhero shows so you have to take what you can get.It's not that it's so bad it's mind numbing. It could just be they are trying to be a basic show, but it starts off not making sense. *spoilers* Kara reveals she's an alien to a friend in the first episode because reasons. There was nothing pressing her, she just needed validation. I guess this makes her more human, but it also makes her a fool. The actual human heroes don't do this why does she? Then again, in episode 5 when trying to dispose of a bomb, she flies through the city instead of diagonally up and away from the city. So perhaps her characters is supposed to be a little... slow. But why does the woman hero have to be slow?As far as small problems, the show just introduces things and forgets about it. Like they will show the DEO posing as FBI one episode, and Kara being completely surprised by this the next, there being a mad bomber identified and his ex-boss (who is supposed to be a genius) walking right by him (not in disguise) but Kara's friend notices him from a far (there's more to this that makes even less sense), not to mention how the bomber go through security, the martian man hunter not using his powers effectively when he should or telling transparent lies the characters can easily check but he's oblivious, or the presence of other Kryptonians that have been on earth a while, but didn't go after Kara immediately nor can they easily handle her adult self in battle in spite of it being established that Kara isn't a good fighter. Or even robots going crazy for no reason loosing pieces of themselves that magically appear in the next scene because the doctor went crazy. *spoilers end* Just seems like lazy writing. The show is better than nothing and I'll continue to watch in hopes it'll get better. As long as you don't notice the little things then this is a great show. While I know there are many flaws in all shows, I don't care for them when they are this glaring. like when they are this glaring.",

(Below is my old review of the first season, as proof)\nBut last night I was a couple of episodes into Season 3 on DVD and realized it has gone from adorable to so cringey I just had to quit completely...Marvel Comics has done this, and I have quit their comics for decades... and now TV shows & movies (Captain Marvel) have caught the Feminazi bug too.I guess it always had many of it's far left wing feminism, and LGBT conditioning and male emasculation and preachy SJW messages, but by the third season THAT SEEMED TO BE ALL IT HAD.\nWhen they weren't dropping quotes about 'the wall' or normalizing and lesbianism, they were tackling racism against Mexicans!\nNone of this is ground breaking, it is just tired and abusive of the writers and the shows powers to shove it down the audiences throats.I guess I will keep watching the other shows hesitantly for now, but Supergirl... I'm done.OLD (a bit embarrassing) REVIEW BELOWI really like Arrow (as it is essentially just a Batman show using Arrow), but it often seems to waste a lot of time and spin it's wheels with it's long seasons... Flash was even better, because it came into Arrows world, and ran with it, like DC/Marvel TV shows and movies ALWAYS should have!Supergirl has taken this to the next level! Not only is she in 'their' world, FINALLY Superman is in HERS!!! Even though it is very subtle in the way Superman is in this show- it's what DC/Marvel always should have done. If you don't use the characters (or can't) then still talk about them, that is the world your character lives in! I have no problem with 'black Jimmy', I hate these characters like traditional him, and 'Aunt May' that seemed trapped in amber, he is both likable and the coolest version of 'Supermans best pal'.I loved the Martian Manhunter reveal, and Red Tornado, they have really started out with all the ducks in a row, character and story wise. The formula is almost exactly like Smallville, Arrow and Flash with the hero and its supporting cast, regular villain, sidekick, unrequited love. It's working, so no reason to change it I guess.Supergirl is both adorable and completely awesome, her casting is perfection, costume looks fantastic and super-sexy, Melissa Benoist is very cute and feminine whilst also strong and tough when needed.I've always been a bigger Marvel fan, but after Smallville, Arrow, Flash, Legends of Tomorrow and now this, DC is my TV universe of choice. This is probably the most likable and enjoyable comic book show with constant payoffs for fanboys and the layman viewer alike.",

I'm very accepting of LGBTQ, but this show treats the idea of lesbianism as being a prize to be constantly shown off, instead of a sexuality like anything else (of course, this may change with the rather awkward dissolution of Sanvers) Also, I can't ignore the fact that Kara is fast and strong enough to tear out the hearts of anyone who gets in her way.

            "content": "Season 1 had a very slow start but it did hook me in and encourage me give it a chance. Right from 'Go' it was campy, cheesy, cringe and quite frankly the last show I watch in my weekly lineup but at the end of the day I just had fun with it.Yes there is a strong female empowerment vibe going on, what with God and the US President being called 'She' by the characters but so what if it's a little feminist sometimes? It isn't stealing from the fun factor at all and her reason for deciding to use her powers for the first time in years was valid and the reason she kept doing it was because of the rush she got from helping people.Her reason for helping people is self gratifying, no doubt, but with all that risk and no reward I would at least want to feel good about doing it and when she fails on more than one occasion due to a lack of experience she does feel bad about it.The best character has to be Cat Grant, her bitchy but wise personality is perfectly written (thought not always expertly acted) and when she does be a little nasty she isn't doing it to be mean but to encourage self improvement in Kara's human life and by god thank you for making her wise without being all knowing.Jimmy Olsen however is a hit and miss, yes he's black when Jimmy is white but he's also just there for no reason except to be the Superman guy without including more major characters from the Superman franchise who would potentially steal the show. Even Quinn has a role with the group but all Jimmy has done is drop Superman franchise names and give advice. He isn't necessary yet but at least he isn't badly written.All in all I missed the cheesy Monster (or Alien) of the Week trope because lately it's been about dark tones with lots, if not excessive amounts, of gore.It isn't amazing but it's fun and Season 2 is, so far, better than Season 1...",

            "content": "I will admit, I was actually rolling my eyes when I saw the first advert for this show. After looking into, I realized my cousin was in it so I initially watched it only in support of him.\nThat being said, I KEPT watching the show for Melissa and because I genuinely think the good FAR outweighs the bad for this show.\nOn that note, I am quite tired of all of the negativity from reviewers about this show. I fully accept that it is not perfect and has it's flaws, but it is seriously not the train wreck some make it seem like it is.\nOne thing I would like to address is people's issues with Kara being stronger than Superman. Superman started out with the same power level as Mon-El in the beginning of his comics. He was MADE stronger by various writers as time went on. Why is so acceptable for him, but not for her to evolve and grow?\nAnother issue I have is people saying her story is the same as his. Her story is MUCH richer than Cal-El's, in my opinion. She ACTUALLY GREW UP ON KRYPTON. SHE ACTUALLY LOST HER WORLD. He was a baby who happened to grow up on earth with alien powers, BORING! He is SO overhyped and was made SO overpowered that he has created an unattainable and unrealistic standard. She is NOT him, she is full of loss and rage and has more depth than he ever had.\nOnto the soap boxes. Yes, I will admit sometimes they shove the message a little too far down your throat, but the importance of the message should not be lost because you don't like the delivery method. Yeah, they paint a bit thickly, but what they are saying is still important and needs to be said.\nThe Danvers sisters have to be the greatest love story ever told. What they have is magical and transcends universes and timelines. It is seriously one of the most beautiful relationships I have ever seen, only made more intense due to the fact that they are not blood related and had a rocky start. What they have built is so strong and so inspiring to what love and family mean and can do for a person.\nFinally Melissa is PERFECT and amazing and she is the best Supergirl ever. She makes Kara such a relatable and real person. She is emotionally unstable and hyper reactive at times, but SHE SHOULD BE. Homegirl lost EVERYTHING and then spent TWENTY FOUR FRIGGIN YEARS in the phantom zone trapped in the endless void (surprisingly NOT going FULLY crazy). I'm surprised Kara is as mentally healthy as she is to be honest. In the comics she is FULL of rage, which they held back a bit but still a great job of showing.\nSometimes the writing is...not great...I'm objective and I will not say the show is flawless, but WHAT SHOW IS?? It's really easy to spread and say hateful about something, but also why? If you don't like it...don't keep watching it. Especially if all you have to say is hateful things with very little constructive criticism.\nSo many characters didn't even exist until recently (Harley Quinn only exists because of the Batman Cartoon). Comics and TV and all of these things are SO good BECAUSE they evolve and grow and try to make characters better and different. I feel like you can either embrace the change and the process, or you can not and just stop watching it then. You can either allow yourself to evolve or stay in your ways and watch the world leave you behind. Do you think I wanted Raven to be 15 years old in Titans when she is supposed to be 19? NO I DID NOT, but I watched it objectively and took it for what it WAS, and not what I thought it SHOULD be. I do the same with everything I watch INCLUDING Supergirl and I suggest others try it.\nIt's not perfect, but it's still really good and it makes me feel better so that's all that matters to me.",

I had my doubts as the hype was brewing, but as a minority and a subject of prejudice my entire life, it would have been hypocritical of me to give it a thumbs down without at least viewing it. Personally I think every new offering deserves at least three airings before it gets shelved. Every offering except this one!!! This show was so bad I found myself laughing through half of it. The kind of laughing you do when someone tickles you; and as much as you want it to stop (because you're not enjoying it) you can't because you have no choice. CBS left me no choice but to hate this show. The writing, the characters, the plot, all of it just screamed: HELP ME!!! Sorry, but if this show lasts in prime time for more than a month, CBS should be ashamed of themselves. I know it's all about ratings, but if by some miracle Supergirl manages to secure high viewer ship over the coming weeks, I still think they should show some modicum of self respect by taking the video files out back, shooting them, and making sure no backup copies exist. Putting shows like this on in prime time is tantamount to drastically lowering the standards of standardized tests; essentially making us ignorant and lazy in our creativity. If Supergirl MUST remain on television, perhaps it should air on Saturday mornings where children's entertainment thrives.",

It took me until half-way through the first series before I realised that it was Robin Tunney. Apart from the physical similarity, there was the convincing cop persona and a wardrobe that might have been transferred from Teresa Lisbon on The Mentalist. But something still gnawed at me - I hadn't hit the exact connection. Then during the second series some smiles - or rather, inflections of smiles - hit me. Chyler has a strong physical resemblance to Robin Tunney, but the mannerisms, the personality that caught me are those of the great Paula Prentiss, who showed her dramatic range in what to my mind are one of the most upbeat films of the 1960s and 70s, \"Man's Favorite Sport?\" and (to me) one of the most downbeat and depressing - \"The Parallax View\". A great actress who is still with us - maybe I've still got it wrong, and I can find no familial connection, but I just feel that her smile lives on today in Chyler Leigh.",

The men are all power-hungry, misogynistic pigs and the women are strong and morally impeccable. Supergirl and her sister spend all their \"down time\" sulking over failed relationships. Jimmy Olsen is a 6'4\" African American Black Belt? Oh, and he literally loses every fight...men suck and women are all a Helen Redy song.

            "content": "After watching the pilot I'll run through some points to reflect my opinion on things:Acting wasn't that bad, it wasn't Oscar, but it was good enough to make me feel.Writing of some of the things they say, or how they discuss things, made me cringe at how idiotic it sounds. But overall plot seems to be nice.Effects were unfinished at some points, explosions looked 'copy, paste', but that's very understandable as long as it's going to be refined.Stunts, the flying scene (which I guess you can say is also effects) was pretty epic looking, as long as it's not going to be \"only on pilot\" and then she hardly fly every 8 episodes, I'll be very pleased with a scene like that every episode. Rope hanging however is poorly done when she flies in place, it looks like she's hanging and struggling to stay straight, another 2 cables attached on her waste need to go to the far sides in order to hold her straight, or turn her leaning.The actress however as nice as she seems, is VERY weak looking, it's almost comedic that she has unexplainable 'super strength', she can't run... I'm sorry a fish can run better, and I've seen strong fit women run, don't bring that sexist S on me. She's very out of shape, her arms and legs are jelly, she barely have 'glue on 5 minutes' abs, and before you even try to start calling this anything, any serious superman actor had to workout like a maniac to get in shape, so what? if it's a girl than \"it's not serious\"? is that how this show looks at women? she needs extreme training till her muscles will harden and fill the space under her skin, no need for weight lifting, just endurance. then she will look like Supergirl. In addition to that, she needs also someone to train and teach her how to stand and walk with power, her \"cover\" look needs to seem as she's \"acting weak\" not as her comfortable state, and then she's \"acting tough\" later.Fighting scenes were trying to go right, and choreography was probably made by an artist, but one can't enjoy a fight scene where the girl looks like she's intensely struggling with LIFTING HER OWN ARMS, it looks like a bad YouTube video 3 kids made. so again, there's no such thing as \"just a girl\", she's an actress playing a super powered alien, workout daily and get in character! The fighting also didn't feel like anyone was trying to hurt anyone, only \"act like it\". (i.e scream in place but don't actually do anything)Music was not helping anything, sometimes even ruining everything.Outfit is too folded on sleeves, but that again can be because of jelly arms... if she'll get in shape for the part, maybe the shirt can fit on her abs smoother, but a smart subtle shirt design shaping may help it rest on the abs better. I like how it was trying to keep it close to 'Man of Steel', but it's too squared and boring, skirt could use some design instead of being a flat cutout fabric, it can be longer in front going diagonally up to the back, and it's too short in general, it would look better with cape flailing effect to it. I like the tights that cover up stuff, but the boots are horrifying I think I got depression from seeing them.Characters are almost good, well all but the main... Supergirl has tons of sass but in a silent way that speaks with actions more than words, she's a shepherd not a sheep. Here I've seen 0 will power from her, and even when she's trying to talk up people it seems like she's constantly looking for their approval. I just don't see the charm of Supergirl there. The \"boss\" looks like a weak, pathetic, idiot, with severe inferiority complex, the fact that she refers to herself as \"a powerful woman\" is comedic, and the fact that others don't show any signs of laughing is offensive. James is not nerdy enough, he stands too firm and he uses charming smiles which are too confident, he talks way too \"in charge\", just.. he can be pretty, but at least act in character.Overall, there's tons of room for improvement, but you have the tools in hand, so it can be done. will I watch the show? Only if improvement will be made, I find no interest in seeing this show as it is, while the Arrow fights the dark corruption of his city, it's actor getting fit, learning his choreography like a boss, Supergirl runs like both her ankles have been sliced? why? cause she's a girl?! I'm sorry but (even if it surprises you, cause I'm a dude) I find that highly offensive. All I'm saying is that if it was 'superboy' the show would've been much more serious.For anyone reading this to know if they want to watch, if you don't mind illogical cheesy lined show, than you may pass your time with it, if you're looking for an intense, dark, charming, complex, and interesting show, than you're in the wrong place buddy.Rate? as it is, 4/10*All of what was written here implies to the 'leaked pilot' and does not stand true in the case of improvements of the official release.*",

Sure it can be cheesy and dumb at times like those shows but they are still lots of fun to watch. The show struggled in its first season because CBS was trying some new things, but once it went over to CW it got a lot better. Also before I say this I would like to point out that I am a man. I'm sick of seeing all of the reviews saying it's feminist propaganda. So because there is a strong female lead and occasionally shows support for women empowerment means it's propaganda and doesn't deserve a fair shake? Besides feminism doesn't mean women are better than men, it means they should be treated equally, and what's wrong with that? Welcome to the 21st century where women can do anything a man can, including leading a superhero TV series. This show represents that notion very well without beating you over the head with it. Melissa Benoist is an awesome Supergirl and the relationship she has with the supporting characters really make this show worth watching, especially her relationship with her sister played by Chyler Leigh. This is the Superman show we always deserved because it's much better than Smallville, but it just happens to be led by a woman, which is awesome. If you're a woman hating piece of garbage then you won't like it, but frankly nobody cares what you think. If you're looking for something fun, that doesn't take itself too seriously and has a wonderful cast of characters, then I'd recommend giving it a shot.",

It does, however, compare VERY well to similar shows, such as The Flash or Arrow. In fact, I think it's a great show for both boys and girls. There was not a single moment where I felt there was some sort of subversive feminist propaganda that some reviewers here mentioned so vehemently. I would even say that there wasn't enough of this so-called propaganda. Do some guys here have so little self-esteem that they feel threatened by a ''chick flick'' aimed at young teens? I think they should be more worried about shows like The Walking Dead (which I like, by the way).It's great that we now have a superheroine to offset the abundance of superheroes.

The premise of the season sees Supergirl attempt to stop an ancient organisation called Leviathan, while Jonn Jonzz has to deal with the return of his long lost brother.Main Character\nMelissa Benoit is back as Supergirl this season and I have just never fully cared about her performance as the character as she is just a bit cheesy and dull, but she is fine and really comes across as a superhero. She has grown into the role well and their are elements of her performance I like and I actually thought her normal identity was more interesting but they don't give it enough time to get the chance to breath and develop.Supporting Characters\nThe show has plenty of characters to try and balance this season and doesn't always do a great job of it, the main one being David Harewood as Jonn Jonzz AKA The Martian Manhunter. The first half od the season does a great job with the character as he has a real personal story, and Harewood delivers a really strong dramatic performance. But then he is just forgotten about for the second half of the season. Braniac 5 played by Jesse Rath has the opposite problem, he doesn't really have much to do in the first half of the season, but after the Crisis on Infinite Earths crossover he gets an interesting new story that fleshes out the character and puts him on a different course then he was in the beginning of the season. But lets get to the show stealer of the show, again he doesn't do anything till after the crossover but Jon Cryer is back as Lex Luthor and he steals every scene that he is in. His character is just so well written and it makes him possibly the most complex villain that there has been in this whole universe. But there are also some weaker characters, Katie McGrath is back as Lena Luthor and they showed promise for the character at the end of last season but they follow it up poorly and take a potentially interesting character and turn her into a bland character. Chyler Leigh as Alex has probably been the most important supporting character but I thought this was the season where the show doesn't give her much to do and actually at times her character actually came off as quite annoying. I thought Nicole Maines as Dreamer was a really important character last season, but this season basically forgets about her for the majority and it is such a let down, there is one episode where she stands out but it doesn't make up for the weak use of her character. The main villains of the season are a group called Leviathan but they are so generic and dull that it really hurts the season as a whole.Story\nThe story has some good individual arcs to it, the highlight being Martian Manhunters in the first half of the season, Brainiac 5's and Lex Luthors from the second half. They are done well, especially seeing Luthor plot and scheme as it adds more complexity to the plot, But due to the Coronavirus, the majority of these plots aren't finished to a satisfying degree and it left me disappointed, even though I am sure they will try and make up for it in the 6th season. They do have an interesting concept of technology versus nature but they miss the mark which doesn't help with the villains being ultimately forgettable and a huge let down.Script\nThe script is a mixed bag, the writing for some of the characters is done well, but then the others are done poorly. There is some good drama here again mainly to do with the characters I mentioned that are treated right, but then there is some poor drama too that feels forced and the majority of the humour didn't quite work unless it involved Lex Luthor.Style\nThe style of the show has some exciting action scenes, this show is possibly the show that involves the biggest action scenes and the spectacle usually works, even though sometimes the CGI doesn't quite hit the levels they want to. Also the fact that there are 19 episodes is just too many, but also at the same time due to the pandemic it actually feels like an unfulfilling ending which is quite ironic.Overall\nOverall, this is once again a pretty average season of this show. After enjoying the 4th season of the show I was hoping for a great follow up but it doesn't achieve that and unless you are already a fan of this show this won't do much for you.Rating - 5/10.",

I particularly find Lena Luthors character to be especially intriguing. As far as the the plot goes it is fairly easy to guess but it does have some edge of the seat moments and is actually quite entertaining. Season 3 did dive too deep into deliberately plugging in political views sometimes in places where it didn't make much sense. At times the politics seemed so forced that it had actually did make you lose track of the actual plot of the show. However the story of Sam and Reign in season 3 was actually very intriguing and was enough to keep me watching.My hopes for season 4 are to dial back even if just slightly on the politics, and keep bringing more complex villains that will test supergirls abilities even more so than Reign. As long as that's done I will keep watching",

Instead of the brash, head-strong, reckless, arrogant Kara, we are given a female version of Clark Kent. And of course since we have a female Clark Kent on our hands, the writers attempt to adapt SUPERMAN stories to a Supergirl character. Plus no offense to Melissa Benoist but she is not right for that role with her look and mannerisms. Laura Vandervoort's portrayal as Kara on Smallville was a lot more accurate and she had the look (I'm sorry they put you in that horrible depiction of Indigo).Viewers have been exposed to the likes of Smallville and Man of Steel with their special effects and fight sequences. Why Supergirl has taken a step back from these examples is beyond me but it makes unpleasant television.",

Hell, even Game of Thrones was awful until the third or fourth episode, then that became one of the greatest shows ever. I'm not saying this is an award winner, but it does its job now, and is entertaining stuff.The acting is on par with Arrow, probably better, and the story lines and look have a similar tone to Flash. It's not a smart show, no complicated plot that requires a whole season to understand, i admit. It is a monster of the week show, and it's refreshing to see that. It also has lots of explosions, and action in every episode. And the Kara issues, even though i'm a guy, i'm relating to. The drama in the background is done very well. Maybe you have to relate to it to appreciate it? I don't know. But some of the characters are going through similar situations to what i'm going through in life at the moment, and reactions are how i'd react. So i can't knock the acting or the dialogue. It's spot on for me. Winn is pretty much me in real life too, so hats off to getting that bang on.As for the look. I get the feeling they were gunning for a similar tone and feel as The New Adventures of Superman, in terms of dialogue, focus, and target market. I think they nailed that. It's obviously for the whole family; not dark, no steamy scenes. The CG is fine. not as bad as many make out on here. It's better than the CG in Dr Who, and in Primeval, and The Matrix for that matter. Enough of that though. It is simple show, comical at times, and has its flaws. But it is entertaining.

It seemed to me that they were running on a deadline and worked last minute as students do. There were two main problems this season: first the VR arc was, how do I say this, a bubble (which never reached its intended size) that exploded. Look, you had an opportunity to actually gradually portray people hooking-up to VR world, loosing focus, loosing sight, becoming addicts etc. throughout the whole season, but you did not do it. You chose to portray these things in the most skimpiest (regarding length) of ways only to conclude this whole VR world is bad, 'mkay, trope in the final two episodes. Second large problem - too many god damn villains this season that all wanted to be the big bads of the season, but didn't. What, we had Lena (wasn't), what we had Acrata (wasn't), what we had Leviathan with all of its goonies (sort of was), but they were all randomly trumpeted by the presence of Lex. You could have dealt with Leviathan this season, and give Lex Season 6, but noooo... you lost sight of the big picture by giving him all of the shadowy puppet master trope this season.

Having said that, I was disappointed in the series. What I was hoping for was a young woman with super powers using those powers to save lives in various scenarios. I figured Supergirl would have romantic relationships which could be, well, romantic, and perhaps humorous too. The series started out somewhat hopeful but then became a kind of confusing mix of Supergirl battling other aliens from other planets with their own assortment of super powers. Meanwhile Supergirl was aligned with still other aliens with various super powers. The episodes are loaded with gimmicks and plot twists that involve pretty much anything that violates physics, including such things as 4th and 5th dimensions and time travel. It all makes for a confusing blend of too many characters in episodes that are needlessly confusing. And through the entire 6 seasons, Supergirl has had scant few romantic involvements. I will say that for some unexplainable reason, through it all I have missed scant few episodes. Maybe that is a case of being endlessly hopeful.",

            "content": "I was looking forward to a series in the vein of \"Arrow\" or \"The Flash\", where men are men, women are women, and both have more or less appropriate behavioral responses. I also expected emotional responses to be true to gender. The fact of the matter is, men and women's emotional reactions to any given situation are different in key ways.I don't know if the script writer for the Winn Schott and James Olsen characters was female, or if the characters are supposed to be gay, closet transsexuals, just effeminate, or suffering from either an overdose of estrogen or a serious deficiency of testosterone. What I found in the first season of Supergirl were men who cry or go into a tizzy when they get a little bit flustered, or get all teary-eyed when they wax sentimental; and who approach virtually every subject from a woman's perspective, and whose general demeanor are not masculine at all, as if they had been neutered and given estrogen hormone therapy.To the writers' credit, the male villains' parts are somewhat masculine, but I think that reflects more on a sexist attitude toward men rather than writing skills or any understanding of human behavior.It seems that the male villains are the only men in the entire production with any masculine traits; and they are portrayed as psychotic murderers and out of touch military officers who are more concerned with making a military career than protecting the people.Overall, whoever is writing the male characters' parts seems to have a frail grasp--fundamental misconceptions--of male behavior and what motivates men to react as they do in any given situation.If it was just one of the male characters who was acting strangely, I would just attribute it to that character's personality; but that isn't the case. Every male character in the story line who is not a villain has the same feminine behavior issues. They act like feminized eunuchs.I think the series would be better served if men wrote all the male characters' parts, and women wrote all the female characters' parts; men and women who have an objective clue as to how real world men and women behave; and not the skewed, unrealistic views of someone with a misandric sexist agenda.I really want to like this show, and I believe I could if the male characters and their dialogue and behavior were more realistic. I see that the next two seasons are already done. I'm hoping that somewhere among those episodes Jimmy Olsen and Winn Schott's testosterone kicks in, and they begin acting and talking like real men instead of emotional adolescent girls. That may have worked for Jimmy Olsen when he was an overly-eager cub photographer; but it doesn't work for a 30-something James Olsen; not in this or any universe.",

            "content": "The thing I don't like most about Superman and Supergirl is that a simple pair of glasses is their only disguise; I mean most of these people are supposed to be reporters!I did start this series ages ago but only got four episodes in before I stopped. Kara was just too awkward to watch and not the adorkable awkward that Barry is on The Flash, just painfully awkward.It wasn't until news broke that Tyler Hoechlin would be starring as Clark Kent/Superman on the show that it made me want to watch the show again.I'm glad I did because it does get better\u0085 in some parts.Kara and Jimmy Olsen are by far the worst characters on the show. I feel like Jimmy is only there to be the sexy, beefcake and doesn't really contribute anything to the story, including the will they/won't they between Jimmy and Kara that gets old real fast and borders on an annoying teenage drama.Winn has his moments during the season but he is clearly the Cisco of Supergirl \u2013 down to being the technical and unlucky in love guy.The best parts of this show are by far Cat Grant (Calista Flockhart), Alex Danvers (Chyler Leigh) and Hank Henshaw (David Harewood). First impressions of Cat is that she's just going to tough as nails boss, who is going to be a thorn in Kara's side but as the season goes on, she proves that she's a tough, powerful woman but has layers that are slowly revealed throughout the season.The relationship between Alex and Hank is probably one of the best things about this show and just gets better and better towards the end of the season.What is it with these superhero shows revealing their secret identities to everyone! So far, Supergirl hasn't been as bad as Arrow and The Flash but we are only one season in.There are flashes of Krypton but you still don't see a lot or learn something that hasn't already been explored but through out this entire season is pop culture references, so many references including Cat Grant making a Harrison Ford joke!Even though this is a show about Supergirl, I feel that Clark Kent/Superman does need to be in it apart from silhouettes. This is her first year being a superhero and she's going to need help especially considering some of the Kryptonian villains.I'm very glad I went back to watching this show; I'm also very interested to see how the show will go on The CW and if it will change much.",

However, as the seasons progressed the storylines got worse and became too preachy about the social issues in today's world. It made the show seem more like a soap opera than an superhero action show. It just was not the appropriate platform to discuss today's social issues. Additionally, the characters were flat and unlikeable. They were constantly whiny and always complaining. To me, the characters Nia, aka Dreamer, Alex, and Kelly seemed to whine the most. The alien designs were also horrible. With the technology and resources we have today you would think that the monsters and costumes would've been better. If the show followed more of the comic storylines, the show would have been better.",

Mon El's character really brought down the show as a whole and brought down the supposed heroine of the show and title character in Kara/Supergirl. Cue Season 3... Now they've brought Mon El back from the future with a wife and are still bringing Kara down to his dude bro level by writing her into a love triangle. Is this really what the writers and producers think we viewers want to see in our Superhero show...especially one that has a female lead? Do they think we want to continue to see her reduced to being a love interest in her own show (Season 2) and now be the mistress in a love triangle (Season 3)?? It's terrible and definitely does not invoke feelings of feminism or empowerment. Frankly, it's just gross. Let Kara be single and be a damn heroine for National City. Is that too much to ask?...and I won't even get into forcing Lena and James together for more relationship drama. Ugh...this show has truly turned into a CW soap opera with nothing but relationship \"drama\" and nt heroics or palpable story line.

No pilot is perfect, but if you enjoy anything in the Superman/Supergirl universe (or watched Smallville) then stick around! I enjoyed how it fit into the established Superman universe and has opened itself up to a lot of villain potential. Melissa Benoist is quite believable, and apart from the necessary sappy references to Superman (to establish the character) it is something worth watching.",

            "review_title": "Straight Downhill",
            "content": "The first two Seasons of the show were acceptable, nearly nice to watch. A female Lead in the Arrowverse was promising and on top she ist the Cousin of Superman, the Symbol of a Man. But man was i wrong. More and more the show changes into a Soap. With every Episode of the show there are fewer and fewer action scenes (with naive dialogs form the heroes) but more and more Drama along the way.I started watching this show because i liked the arrowverse and wanted to keep up. But with every Season i regret it even more that i started the show.If this should be the way to show that Women are powerful NOBODY is gonna believe that. The whole female Cast of Supergirl will look like whiny little girls next to Laurel, Dinah or Felicity (actually powerful Women in Arrow). I think, in order to make the female roles more poweful they actually weaken and soften the roles of the male characters) In all of the Epsiodes they start crying when somebody dares to withstand them. Im sorry that is not the Way to show the World how strong Women are. (WOMEN ARE POWERFUL) Dont forget that. You might forget that watching this show.Then there is this beautiful Double Standard for the Danvers Sisters. As long as it is in their Favor or their Belief it is ok to do so. As soon as it goes against them they will obey everything to get their way, which they think is ALWAYS the right way. This makes me hate Alex and Cara because they can do whatever they want and get away with it. They dont have to fear big conseqences, because after all they come out on top. No matter how much more strong the opponent was over the course of a series , at the end the Villain hast to concede to supergirl and her lame Speeches about the good oft he world bla bla bla.SpoileralertFor Example Season 4 when Lockwood becomes the Secretary of the DEO and Alex suddenly obey Orders as she wish to get him down. By the way HE IS IN CHARGE OF THE DEO. He is your superior Officer and you have to follow Orders. Wasnt this the phrase Alex told us every single episode when somebody is against the almighty Alex Danvers? She is the first to obey orders and the first to correct others when they obey the orders. And that is simply wrong. Although we all know that Lockwood is bad, through their behaviour against him, he becomes easier to like and support. EVEN THOUGH HE IS THE BAD GUY.Again as soon as Lena is lying to Cara about cryptonite, their Friendship nearly evaporates. But here she is constantly lying about her identity to nearly everybody. And thats ok because she is Cara Danvers.Which brings me to my next point. Oliver Queen goes to prison in order to overcome the Villain. Barry often loses a team member to beat the villain. Apparently Supergirl can beat every villain every season without ANY lasting loses.On top of all that there are the (im sorry for that) stupidly naive Motives of the Heroes. Whenever Supergirl fights , she always tells the opponent that she wants to fight for the people and the good oft he world but as soon as the people dare to differ from her Ideals and Motives she doenst care about them and does it anyway.To sum up, the Show is incredibly annoying to watch. Mainly because of Alex and Cara. In Season four i was activley cheering for Lockwood (the Villain) to beat Supergirl. I was sick and tired of Supergirl just win it again with no lasting consequences or any Damage what so ever. You dont feel like they deserve the win.P. S. To all of you who might feel attacked by that review of mine, please realise that this is my opinion an my opinion only. You dont have to attack me for that. Im sure you have a different opinion on that subject.",

            "content": "This show looked pretty bad even in the early commercials they were showing before it started.Sometimes that's not a reflection of the show, but in this case it is. It's just not a good show. In fact it's pretty bad.I wanted to give it a chance, because I liked that there was someone doing a superhero show without going the (now redundant) path of making it darker and more depressing.The problem is that they go way, way, way too far into the other extreme. There's no subtlety at all. They pretty much tell you exactly what you're supposed to think of the character, with no room for interpretation. I notice this seems to be a trend, especially with CBS shows, so I shouldn't be surprised. Still, it's pretty obnoxious and they're basically assuming their audience is too stupid to figure these things out for themselves.The writing is just horrible. Like what you might expect from a couple of middle-schoolers. I'm sure the actors had to be cringing while doing their scenes. I've been watching some British shows and a few from other regions and they don't seem to have problems writing shows targeted towards women. For whatever reason it's something that is still a struggle here in the U.S. It can't be denied, the writing is that bad. Even the CW doesn't get this bad.The \"girl power\" aspect is taken too far as well, not to mention it's about 15 years to late to be that overt about it.I don't really know what the point of Jimmy Olson is. People will have a fit because he's black now, of course. But apparently they've changed him from an awkward geeky type to some kind of suave, confident model. But they already have a character taking the sort of awkward geek role, and it feels like Olson is there to create a love triangle. Perhaps it's the \"Twilight\" effect where these producers feel like a show targeted towards women has to have a love triangle now.Sometimes shows cant take a few seasons to find their legs, but with the way TV is now I just don't see this show getting that chance, or even taking advantage of it if they were.It's unfortunate too. It's still tricky to get a superheroine show off the ground, and it's unfortunate that when they do they screw it up. Pros: \u0095 Nice change of space to have a superhero show (or any show for that matter) that's not trying to be so negative. \u0095 Melissa Benoist is okay as Supergirl. Still feels too much like she's acting, but if given time she could probably really gel into the roleCons:\u0095 Terrible writing \u0095 Clich\u00e9, one-note characters (taken to an extreme)\u0095 Pushing some kind of feminist agenda too hard when it doesn't need to",

For twenty years all I've seen is shows from Warner's/DC which just scream \"BE NORMAL\" that super powers are wrong! Who in their right mind would chose to give up superman's powers to be normal...maybe Batman.. he's sightly demented (hear he takes little kids into violent crime zones)but hey I know it's all a \"fantasy\" but give me a break are you trying to tell me that all the stories dealing with \"gods\" in the past, now and future show Zeus sitting on his throne just praying, begging to be normal!! Why do I keep referring to \"the big guy\" when doing a review of Supergirl...well guess what guys..she's the best gosh darn superman ever (only the animated shows are better) ...guess they were right girls do have to work twice as hard. Kara tells us each week how she has always wanted to use her GREAT powers for GOOD and I believe her..she is the best I've ever seen at it..but there is ONE SMALL PROBLEM she also BRAGS that when she arrived on Earth once she discovered that we had Superman we had enough superheros (ONE!!!) so she would use her amazing powers TO BE THE greatest secretary in the world (must be millions of them..but I can assure you, Kara is the fastest at shorthand) IN FACT, for the past twelve years she has practiced and refined her use of her superhearing to the point where can she tune out the screams for help, all the police sirens, all the fire alarms AND be able only know when her boss is about to arrive and have her coffee ready..WHAT A HERO!???..you know how hard this was to stomach and still watch this...had to, got a crush on SUPERGIRL, it has got to get better..meet the cast now.not very big..strange tho..this is the daily planet..wait no that can't be right..no met Perry White..no he's a woman?? Wait a minute I've seen this show..wasn't it the Adventures Of Superman..just don't remember all the women...must be all the drugs..no it's just that this show ain't original at all..kind of feels rushed..like kind of faster then a speeding bullet rushed..give them credit almost a perfect copy of the Daily Planet and it's crew...only noticed one mistake..there seems to be two Jimmy Olson s (maybe he's Lois Lane huh),nah the writings so clever that you know this poor guy is DOOMED DOOMED DOOMED he's one them there red shirts on Star Trek..he ain't going make it to the end of this pilot,,,ah, wait he did in fact live to go on to become Lois Lane...I think..nah he's doomed just not yet...but you just wait that first kiss is going to be a killer...well you just hold on to your draws boys this is the best. For the next four or five weeks this \"girl\" proves herself time and again. She is perfect in so many ways..within no time she proves she's A WOMAN a serious and unbelievable fantastic person (who very shortly should finally receive her long awaited godhood medal after all these years) TEN WEEKS..this is one great superhero show..well it was..you see Kara/Supergirl/Superman gets it wrong and she was doing so well..she forgot that she was suppose to save Lois Lane not kill him..oh and how she does it..this fantastic woman turns into \"teenage Kid\" and rips his heart out and craps on it not once, but as far as I can tell twenty or thirty more times...I really liked how about three days later after \"burying\" Lois..she announces she's going out on her first real date,what caring what kindness...BULL Kara would never have done this and Supergirl would never have allowed it to have happened,,what is even cooler..everyone one on the show every character knew about his love and knew where it was headed and they all stood by and let it happen...the kid has some real friends. This show was doing so well as a superhero show..now it's just another teenage soap opera, showing kids destroying each others lives in they quest to be normal,,,SORRY SUPERGIRL..I wish you luck, but I can't set here any more and watch you destroy all those around you. You know I hear that later in the season you will feel the effects. of red krytonite,what are you going to do, kill your best friend, for real this time..oh and slowly..rip his heart out and laugh..no I bet you'll kiss him and say you're sorry as his lifeless body slides to the floor,,wait that's evil and only Kara knows about love and how to handle it..she's the one that has to kill him,,his best friend..his love.his goddess. I'm not very good at soaps..neither is Kara...WHY COULDN'T YOU LET SUPERGIRL LIVE..why did you kill this boy..in doing so you killed Kara..Supergirl and me..well as I shut off the program for the last time I offer this advice to Kara:quit your day jobstop trying to be a girl, be a WOMAN for once. NO,be the SUPERWOMAN you should have always been...but it's only a fantasy..a TV show who cares...maybe us old timers, who thought of our heroes..our SUPER HEROES were worth believing in..oh well there are plenty of other shows to watch, I hear there's a great western show on in the afternoon..believe it's called General Hospital..oh wait maybe, it's another superhero show.",

It got off on the wrong foot from the get go, having it be in the shadow of a greater hero who just do anything and let's Kara do as she will with what comes to be the fate of the world.Add to that the problems with character, having people be action heroes when they're meant to be anything but, an overarching bad guy that doesn't appear to be anything intimidating and to wrap that up with bad effects leads this to be a fail in nearly every sense.And with the introduction of the multiverse they couldn't include Power Girl?

I'll be very surprised if this show lasts more than a couple of seasons. Take some learning from Gotham, fantastic show, excellent characters and awesome actors to take on those roles. Hence the success, its not rocket science its not about money, you place the name Supergirl on a TV show its going to sell it self, you just need to go out and get good actors, it doesn't even need to be someone extremely famous and expensive !!!

            "content": "Is Supergirl conventional? No. Does it have a strong, female presence of characters? Yes. Does that make it feminist propaganda? NO. Why? BECAUSE THERE ARE STRONG REPRESENTATIONS OF MALE HEROES TOO. Also, side note, heroes don't always have to be SUPERheroes. They can be the engineers, the designers, the programmers, or from a strategic physical background like police, military, etc. POINT IS: even an average Joe could have a skill to contribute to help stop the bad guys. That being said...Supergirl is a show that at first, I wasn't sure about and honestly thought it was pointless to make. After reading plenty of these ignorant, small minded, intolerant reviews, now I see even more significance to the show. It's a different interpretation of a character that yes, will at times where the show digresses to be more of a sentimental and dramatic situation that doesn't necessarily involve a fight VERY SIMILAR to those that people seem to be forgetting to also appear in Arrow, The Flash, or The Legends - all of which have a much higher rating. Granted, there are times where I feel that Supergirl as a series has taken a wrong plot turn or a character has developed in a way I haven't liked but that's going to happen in ANY tv show - DC or not! Get over it. Another thing negative reviewers seem to be forgetting is that THERE ARE MALE HEROES INVOLVED TOO. So to call this show strictly feminist garbage is ridiculous biased bigotry of small minded and/or ignorant individuals. Could it be better? Well, every show could be better. Is the writing bad? It definitely has its moments where it could have been improved. Is the acting terrible? On the whole, not at all but as with all casts, it varies with the individuals and while some may be talented, others that are less great can leave a deeper, more memorable impression thus bringing the others down. All in all, admittedly, yes it has its imperfections and \"could haves\", \"should haves\", \"would haves\" as quite honestly any other tv show ever made will but ultimately, if given a chance and watched with an open mind, it is a good show. It doesn't always follow a plot we'd like, but it is worth the watch.",

Skewing comments sections just to take on a self-righteous, anti feminist pulpit not only demonstrates the absolute weakness and insecurity which many Western males have fallen to, but also obscures anything promising about a new program, especially this show which is not half bad.Looking past the vast insecurities of many commentators, this is actually a very fun program which (although flimsy and somewhat aimless in its first couple of episodes), builds into an enjoyable super-hero themed drama/comedy program. Mixing good special effects, decent action sequences, above-the-board villains, and yes a bit of social commentary (albeit general commentary, and nothing resembling anything close to a feminist agenda), the show grows on you, especially if you are a white male like myself who does not have deep seated anger towards women, and doesn't feel threatened by the idea of a female hero. Overall - watch this program, as it's comparable to anything in the network-TV produced hero genre. A great little popcorn show for general entertainment.",

This show has had a slow start, but wow it's starting to come good. People calling it a pro-feminist show need to get there heads out of there rear ends! Just because there is 4 of the main characters as women, does not make it a feminist show. The shows actual style is starting to make it a fun enjoyable, family friendly, yet fairly easy watching show. If your looking for another marvel daredevil style show (a great show btw) then you are sadly mistaken!This show is a bit like the \"Man of steel's\" attempt to take flight and eventually take flight. Me not being a comic book fanatic, has allowed me too watch this show without having a premeditated opinion. Like the Flash and Arrow, this show has started slowly, but the pilot episode I thought was very intriguing. Plenty of action, yes some cringe worthy scenes, but overall well made. It appears to be coping a lot of hate for not actually doing much wrong. The idea that we need to realise is that the shows and films these days are no longer designed to appeal just too the comic lovers but rather to a wider audience. When I heard this show was coming out I didn't think id give it a go, I would write it off, but now having watched the first 2 episodes it is slowly but surely managing to reel me in, a bit like arrow, which lots of critics and people said was awful. Open mind people that's all that's needed. This show as i said is like the attempts to take flight. It is jumping around, smashing into things, but after the second episode, I think it's managed to take flight, and has started too reveal itself as a great show. 8/10 and a recommend if your after a fun enjoyable, show, that is easy watching!",

            "content": "Since I heard about the new DC Comics series about Supergirl I have been exited for watching the super heroine on screen. I was even more exited after watching the trailer, however the pilot left me a little disappointing. I know that pilots have a lot of pressure because they have to start a whole new franchise and box office in order to stay on screen, but presenting a story about a comic universe that have many things to offer doesn't have to rush fast.SPOILER ALLERT! - Supergirl's (Kara) mission guiding Superman towards the right path has been canceled as she was trapped in a sort of black whole/time frame for many years that kept her from aging. When she finally came to earth as a 13 year old, Superman, who was only a baby when she was a young teenager, has grown up to be an adult and a famous superhero. The fact that Superman isn't allowed to be shown on the small screen in this series and Supergirl being Superman's cousin makes the series a Superman spin-off. A spin-off is okay on the small screen, if you tell the story in the right way. As long as the stories involving the plot from the comic books and new ideas are told right, you are able to amaze the audience. The problem is though that too much happened in one episode. Kara's background was presented of cause, but the fact that her foster sister turns out to be a sort of undercover agent from a secret organization that captures citizens from Krypton is quite lame. It could be okay, but it happens just like that. Supergirl found out maybe 20 minutes into the movie and she quickly forgave her sister. After that she quickly teamed up with the organization when she had to capture escaped criminals from krypton. Also Supergirl's presentation was happening to fast. I think that they should had given her the whole pilot and then in the end present the real conflict with her evil aunt, who wanted to destroy her. Too much information in just 40 minutes! Can CBS really pull off the rest of the story safely? I will give the next episodes a chance, to see if they make it and take it a bit more slow. Marvel knows how exactly to give the stories of Superheroes time enough to obtain validity, but DC Comics apparently don't always - Justice League is being formed too fast! But that's another discussion.Terrible acting, yet already many fans. COME ON LADIES! CAN'T YOU ASK FOR BETTER ACTING AND STORYTELLING?! Based on the views the series have already made, I can see that women tend to raid the series very high. Yeah, I like the idea of a cute and awkward personal insistent working for a version of the Vogue headquarters in New York, JUST LIKE DEVIL WEARS PRADA. Great idea! Then CBS can expand their audience and apply to the female audience as well. I am a woman who loves Devil Wears Prada and I'm a superhero fan as well, but it could be nice for at change to see more series with superheroines and female villains who I actually care about. I think that Kara/Supergirl is doing okay. She just needed more screen time in the pilot. She may be a little insecure, but that's the whole point of telling a story because we can follow her character development. The good thing is that her character is likable, but I'm missing good acting in all of the series' actors and actresses. It's just very important that all actress and actresses don't just read up their lines, they have to actually act and express them, otherwise I cannot take the outcome of their characters seriously. The other DC Comics series Arrow and The Flash both lacks real acting. The stories and plots a great, but the actors tend to spend a lot of time telling what they are feeling and not expressing it, so they take up the screen time in the wrong way. You CAN make series that are just fun to watch, but in order to keep the audience and make it grow you have to make the acting more reliable in order to obtain the story's validity, just like Marvels Avengers and Guardians of the Galaxy did. They are both humorous and serious. WE NEED COMPLEX CHARACTERS!!! Specially villains, not just streets thugs. Antiprotagonists who plays with the protagonist's weakness and with psychology in general are the best! YES, the show only has a pilot, but I really hope they will impress me with Kara's evil aunt. I know that you can't expect a villain on The Joker's level. But you could at least create a sort of female Lex Luthor who do not only know that she has to use kryptonite to take down Supergirl, but play with her insecurities as well. A good villain partially shapes the superhero's identity. There are lot of things you could do with Supergirl. This makes me a bit more exited for the next episodes, but I am still afraid that the series will fail a good impression of comic book stories and acting.Based on these observations I give the show 5 stars. Sadly because the it rushes too much and the acting is pretty bad. Storytelling depends on the presenting when making new series, because you have to catch a stable audience for the series so the show doesn't get canceled. Maybe the series have presented too much which have given the wrong signal. I REALLY REALLY HOPE that the next episodes are better, because I love comic book stories and it would be nice if the series don't ruin the franchise. Maybe I will raid the show higher after the next episodes.",

Imagine if every show of Supergirl included a priest citing passages from the Bible and building a story-line that suggests you should go to church every Sunday! Would you accept that has okay and normal? So yes being Gay is your right so is going to church on Sunday, therefore, Please! Could the producers and writers find a balance that exercises a story-line that doesn't seem dogmatic or overbearing also at the cost of ratings, but rather one that sticks to the excitement we all experienced from season one that of Supergirl!!",

Not once in Seasons 1-2 did she mention wanting a child.There was absolutely nothing \"modern\" about that breakup. It was insulting. And now the writers and show runners are bringing back Mon El...one of the least progressive characters you could have.

This just happens to be one of those cases where there is a marked difference between public opinion and film critics with particular expertise in the subject (allowing for a few exceptions here and there, of course). These days it usually takes something extra in a show for me to be able to prolong a level of interest lasting for more than 3 or 4 episodes (tops). I remained transfixed throughout the first two seasons of Hannibal, for instance, but season 3 just seems to me like overkill (I don't know, maybe it's an American thing; if this was the U.K. they probably would have ended the show earlier; in contrast, Bates Motel, yet another of those rare programs that rise above the riffraff of the age and signal something akin to excellence in broadcasting, could have left off at the end of season two and it would have made for an elaborate and picturesque tableau that captures perfectly the spirit of the \"times,\" but in this case season four is currently in the works and I couldn't be more thrilled). Enough about me, let's have a look at the data I extracted from three of the biggest aggregator sites for things like film reviews and TV Shows: IMDb, Rotten Tomatoes, and Metacritic. (Brief disclaimer: in no way, shape, or form am I an expert statistician or very good at math, either. I'm an amateur, so, read the article, but take everything I say with a grain of salt.) According to IMDb's ratings, Supergirl merits a slightly above average score of 6.3 stars at the time this review was posted, which, along with the first three pages of user reviews, obviously does little to demonstrate the appeal of this show. Metacritic measures the show's success based on 33 critics and gives a positive appraisal of its value, with \"generally favorable reviews.\" The show earns a meager score of 4.5 \"mixed or average reviews based on 288 Ratings\" in the User Reviews category. The same drastic split resurfaces on the Rotten Tomatoes site: the consensus rates it highly at 97%, while the audience score drops down to 52%.Anyway, after reading so many negative reviews, I figured why not throw in my vote of confidence and maybe help even things out a bit.

The creator of Superman and Supergirl specifically made them as such NOT OUT OF SEXISM but because Supergirl is in fact OLDER than Superman but was altered during the escape which makes her look younger. The ignorance and blatant \"I blame men and society for my problems\" is very frustrating when you are just trying to enjoy a childhood past-time free of politics and radical ideology.

In season 1 the episodes usually started with a liberal slant and would show the other side of the argument, which was kind of nice, but I tire of politics in *everything* I watch. It tried to be objective but you could tell the stance of the writers, but they did try. By the end of season 2 I really felt like the show was attacking me and my family's beliefs. When a show pulls current events into the story they should realize that first off most political disagreements are not black and white and secondly it isn't a good idea to vilify half of your audience just to make a statement.The problems aren't simple, the solutions aren't simple, putting them into a superhero show, oversimplifying them and vilifying people that disagree with you isn't cool.I'm going to give season 3 a shot. My wife isn't unless I convince her otherwise.",

            "content": "I love all things Fantasy, I do but I hoped for so much and so little of my hopes were realised. It's the writing: Both Shakespeare and Supernatural found lasting success because they based their respective heroes (and villains) in myth. The Supergirl villains do not tug on the heart strings so much as remind you of really good comics and much better films. If they wanted to keep it light the writers could investigate real accidents or crimes and pick the funniest ones to get supergirl involved in.The action scenes are good. I hope they keep that up. Her flying is also good but her landings need work. The writers missed so much with her learning: what happens when a superperson sneezes? If her snipy b!tch of a boss was more of a 3D character it would mean something when she tells 'supergirl' to do something embarrassing. Where are the slightly funny questions? Who does her hair? Does she have superhair? What's it like when she's clumsy? How much does she weigh? Wouldn't it be great if she got into a bar fight? What's she like around kids? What does she do when she sees minor unfairness happening? What about the unfair things that happen that she can do nothing about? THAT would make a great show.The will-they-won't-they clich\u00e9 is a clich\u00e9 because it works. Shows like Bones, The X-Files and Fraiser employed this device with style and aplomb. The Supergirl writers' offering to posterity is half-hearted at best. There is not one foreign accent in the place. That idea is getting more xenophobic by the day. I want to see Mexicans interact with Supergirl and Koreans and lesbians too! Also motorcycle enthusiasts. That would be great. The original Jimmy helped drive the show. This Jimmy is just hunk number x so far. Where's the comedy? Where's the social commentary that superman and other comics feed on and gain stature from? If the writers were brave and wanted to last more than a few seasons they would have their super-villain be a really clever mixed-up cop with his own posse of villainous cops as well as so many good policemen and heartbroken civilians. I understand you can't be dark all the time but you can't be light all the time either.A strong Supergirl could really bring something to that inevitable match up between the Flash and Arrow. Why did she have to be so middle class? Why is that the go-to place? There would be so much amazing writing to be had if an interclass relationship between her living space and her job were established. So far this thing is mediocre. Plastic. Not a single line is said here that hasn't been heard in another soap somewhere. Not one plot twist in the offing. Not one surprise. That's tiresome. A little overt feminism couldn't hurt either. A good transgender villain would double ratings instantly. The younger the better. If they turned into a good guy a few episodes later, that would mean something.This reads like a rehash of Smallville without the versatility. It seems like the writers have already run out of steam. I truly hope I'm wrong and that something original will soon show. The plot, casting (in terms of who WASN'T cast) and vignettes are unimaginative. Lauren Graham would have killed it. Lenora Critchlow, Antonia Thomas, Maria Bamford, Bill Bailey, Matt Lucas, Rachel Feinstein, Jill Scott and Marina Franklin would all be amazing additions to the show if their parts were well written. In summary. I would rather we had a supergirl than didn't but I don't think it's enough to just study how to write and then get a job writing a show. It shows. An injection of real life and real issues (a little philosophy) could keep supergirl on the air for generations. Make a few enemies. Continuing this plasticity would be poisonous.",

Maybe my problem is that I have seen too many good shows. Maybe that's it, I know too much, and I can't help but compare this show to the likes of Daredevil or even Super-girl's counterparts: Arrow, or The Flash. What annoys me more though, is that there are people here, (trolls) who give it like stellar reviews. \"It's amazing! I love it!\" really? Rotten tomatoes critics give this 97%, while the viewers give it somewhere in 50%. This shows the huge disparity in the reception. I noticed also that there was also an underlying tone of \"pump your fist, lets wear our red bandanna feminism!\" flying around, which I had not noticed as much until coming here, but even then, its still awful!

Aspects of the story that really helped make it what it was.Super girl is cute at least but all of the writers attempts to add romance into the story line fail terribly.If they want this show to air on more than the Disney channel i would seriously hope they kill off some main charters, add some heart break, and start over to try to save what little plot they have managed to build.Please make the fight scenes at least a little more realistic...i mean i understand its \"super\" powers and all but a little realism in how people in these situations would actually fight would be nice.

CBS (and now CW) are determined to shove this Liberal propaganda down our throats and AREN'T going to change it, no matter what. The shows offensiveness is actually BY DESIGN, but created by people completely unable to recognize or acknowledge the mess they've created. If you've seen the \"male-lead\" superhero shows, you see that their writers build up their characters, both male and female. In Supergirl, only women are built up, men are depicted as evil, lowlife rats. the Supergirl writers only see the show as a place where you have to tear others down (the men) in order to built women up.

I love the shows intent on combining the action with a girl's perspective on being a hero, in charge of a team of believers. The cause is protecting the human race, the drama is realistic, her character, is flawed.I love Melissa Benoit's take on the role. I am thrilled that both Dean Cain, and Helen Slater agreed to make cameos on the show. I think Melissa offers viewers the likability I have come to appreciate in both Gustin, and Amell, on their DC programs. I also believe she could easily be added to the DC film cannon, opposite Henry Cavill, in a stand alone Superman film, down the road. I just wish DC films, took their DC TV counterparts as part oft he larger cannon. But that's not Melissa, or the Supergirl's casts fault.I think for a woman to be leading a show, as an action heroine, whose still feminine, and yet intelligent is remarkable. I love the character of Supergirl. I think Christopher Reeve would have been impressed with Melissa's take on the character because she, as Supergirl reminds me a lot of Reeve's Man of Steel. The importance of this show is undeniable. The critics have been ruthless on this show, despite it's intentions to be both relevant and entertaining.I hope a season 2 is going to happen.

Worse, the action is ridiculous. Case in point #1: two people using \"laser vision\" against each other. The strike in the middle as if they were quarterstaves, and when they move the rays are deflected upward to strike a beam. Light doesn't work like that; if two lasers (or flashlights!) are pointed at each other, the light passes through the opposing beam and strikes whatever it's aimed at. Case #2: Supergirl gets struck in the chest by another bean and is blasted backward like a shot, but ripping off a car door and holding it in front of herself completely stops the same beam. There are far too many other examples to list.Kara is what, in her late 20s? She acts like she has a 12-year-old's crush on one guy, giggling stupidly and looking awkwardly, while completely missing the signs of another potential paramour. She is completely cowed by her boss (ok, maybe I can let that one go), but should be far more self-assured considering the show's constant feminist leanings. She has lived 15 or more years on Earth already; she should be past that stage in her life.Supergirl doesn't ever let go in combat even when she's literally being killed. She KNOWS she has the same abilities as her cousin, but at one point he has to show up and simply stands before her attacker and ignores the same attack that is killing Kara. How many times must she suffer badly at a bad guy's hands before she thinks \"Hey, I'm being killed, perhaps I should hit back hard?\" And really... the whole glasses/no glasses \"secret identity\" is as stupid as it ever was. I mean, anyone who has ever seen her up close (like her boss, duh) in both guises can clearly see the little indent above her left eye, not to mention the smile, the face, etc. To quote a scene from Lois and Clark years ago, it's just \"galactically stupid.\" There are so many plot holes and failures in general that after 5 episodes, my family has chosen not to watch any more. It's a shame, because we REALLY wanted this show to be good, at least on the level of Flash. The Supergirl/Kara character has just as rich a story (in the comics) as Superman, but this show is failing her in a big way.",

            "content": "First of all, i might say a lot of negative things in this review, but i'd like to assert that so far, i like the show just fine! It's got some good humor, the characters are fun (even if the acting is, at times, a little stiff), and the story captured my attention enough that I went to look up the second episode immediately even though i knew it wasn't going to come out for a few weeks yet! Nonetheless, I do have some things that did bother me.One of my main problems was how thick they laid on the feminism. As a feminist, I did actually agree with everything they said, but the best way to showcase your ideals is not to throw them in a viewer's face, but to demonstrate them. Show, not tell. The design of her costume and the presentation of it--awesome! The way there's almost constant \"what, you think she can't do it because she's a /woman/? well you're wrong because LOOK AT HOW FEMINIST WE ARE!!!\"-- please don't patronize me. If i were to describe their attitude in one word, i would probably say either \"defensive\" or \"aggressive\". Maybe both. It's the same as in one of those pretentious over-the- top environmental films that tries to make its point by throwing nature in your face and demonizing man instead of just showing you the beauty of nature that we're slowly losing. You don't have to be aggressive about it--if you act like her being a superhero woman is normal, viewers will see a superhero woman as normal.In relation to this point, we move to the combat, probably my least favorite part of the pilot episode. For a pilot episode, they presented Kara with a particularly powerful opponent. He was strong, was able to injure her (which could have been a bigger deal and an interesting dilemma if they had brought that in after at least a few episodes), and clearly overpowered her on many occasions. In the first episode, you really want to showcase the ability of your protagonist, especially in a superhero show. You make your protagonist impressive. It would have been much cooler if we got to see Kara tossing her opponent around like a rag-doll in the first episode. I want to see her pick up a guy and throw him fifty feet. I want to see her punch a man through a concrete wall without breaking a sweat. I want to see her land before her opponent before a fight and leave a crater where she set foot. I want to see her shoot lasers like a policeman shoots a gun. I want to see her be /AWESOME/. What i got however, was an opponent so strong that her powers seemed almost useless. So strong that she seemed to be at the strength of an almost normal human while she fought with him. I want to know why I felt almost like her powers were sort of run-of- the- mill even though they repeatedly assured us that she was just as obnoxiously strong and fast as Superman? It was actually really not fun to watch her be repeatedly thrown to the ground, repeatedly overpowered; to see her repeatedly have to use words to get her opponent to lower his guard so she could regain the upper hand. I'm tired of seeing a woman have to use her head to beat a man. I want Supergirl to be able to plow through her opponents just like Superman. I want to see Supergirl just go in blind like an idiot and come out as the victor for once, instead of having to forcibly be taught that she \"can't win just with pure strength like men can\". I want to see her overpower him with little effort. I want to see her kick his butt to next Sunday. I want to see her strong and confident and not needing to think her way out of a bad situation because /she's strong enough that she doesn't get into the bad situation in the first place/. Getting kicked around and overpowered by her opponent should be a obstacle in later episodes. Finding that maybe she does need more training should be for later, when she's become maybe a little overconfident in her abilities. Showing her feeling lost of hopeless and considering giving up should be halfway through the season, not in the first episode. Some of the best elements of a Superhero show were used up in the first episode. Everyone we currently care about already knows she's Supergirl, so we don't get to wait in hope that that one character that doesn't know, will find out about it. The becoming disheartened about abilities and coming back stronger than ever was used up. We already see the face of our current greatest adversary, and even more disappointing, we even know who they are and what their goal is, removing all mystery. It's just a little underwhelming.For a show that's so aggressive about how feminist it is, it sure comes up shockingly short in the parts that really matter in showcasing that belief. Overall, there are a lot of things about this show that I don't like, however, I still want to see more. I'm still sucked in to the story. I'm still anxiously awaiting episode two. I'm still looking forward to where the story will go and how it will improve. Supergirl is obviously not perfect, but we also can't really judge a show by its pilot episode. And thus, with an optimistic attitude, I look forward to episode two!",

And now into Season 3, once again, Kara and her alter-ego are taking a backseat so Mon El and more new characters can take over. How much longer do the writers and producers expect us to sit and watch the Mon El and the Legion show? I'd be fine if they were only going to be around for an episode or two to help her with Reign, but for some reason, Supergirl is always getting defeated and needing help. Sure, even a superhero might need help every now and again. But all the time? Unfortunately, there's nothing much keeping me from continuing to stick with this show. The writers had an huge opportunity to capitalize on an inspiring, empowering female superhero, story, but unfortunately, what they've given us is a disappointing mess of a show that continues to go downhill by making their once strong, independent and courageous female characters watered down and weakened, thus contradicting the notion of empowerment so many of us female viewers tuned in to see and appreciated in Season 1.",

Several episodes are great in the first season through to mid-third season. There is a minimum story of Supergirl's Krypton and her family. The rest of the seasons are uninteresting and the storylines are largely scattered as it doesn't focus on a single character. And also it is really unnecessary to have too many superheroes unless there is a specific reason.ACTION SCENES:\nThe fighting between supergirl and villains are quite underbalance. The visual effect is fine but it doesn't blend well with the fight movements. There is one thing that it looks quite unreality everytime she lands on the ground and flies unsmoothly, not like an original Supergirl movie.ACTOR/ACTRESS:\nMelissa is OK but it is hard to think that she is Supergirl. She could be well fit into any type of romantic movies or possibly drama movies.Chyler Leigh is no good to be Kara's sister, her acting skill is too stiff. I wonder who came up with an unprofessional concept of cutting a strange half haircut. It is quite distracting.I think Katie McGrath might be perfect to be Supergirl because of her appearance and can be easily unrecognised in between Linda with brown hair and Supergirl with blonde hair. Lena's character is incomplete alongside Kara/Supergirl as it doesn't connect.A few villains are boring, even famous Lex Luthor. Jon Cryer won't work as Lex with his shaved head and a beard, he looks terrible. It would be better without a beard and pick someone else.A VARIED SUPERHEROES:\nThey're associated with Supergirl's assistance and there are no further tales of in-depth characters.MY OVERALL REVIEW:\nI am not sad that it is finished but the inexperienced writers ruined the classic supergirl over the years.

Melisa is one of my favorite actors, so I have nothing against her, but the lines some of the actors were given seemed very unnatural and unrealistic. This could become a really great show, but it needs to grow and evolve a bit more. Going back to the storyline of the first episode, it did start in the right direction, but they tried to pile in more things than they needed to, so it felt very choppy and disconnected. The conflict between Kara and Alex went much too quickly, and the situation with Vartox could have been extended into the next episode.

Mind you, I'm a breast man to begin with and therein is the rub. Try as I might, I just couldn't see them although I knew very well they were there. The costume designers obviously had a mandate to undersell her sexuality, unlike Wonder Woman, for example. Her blouses/shirts were cut in such a way that the only hint I had of anything but a slight swelling were the small pleats that looked suspiciously like breasts and nipples, but were angular like little triangles rather than nice and round. In fact there are no round lines anywhere. This anomaly in addition to the attempt to bring Supergirl's secondary place in the family front and center finally put it to rest in my mind and I abandoned watching and freed up 2 tapes for other shows.",

I don't wanna be too harsh on this show as of now since only the pilot version has been aired, well....leaked. First off don't expect much superman references going forward. They aren't allowed to even use the name due to copy rights. So lets get started, right out the gate I see she is familiar with the workings of her powers so we don't have to wait and ponder \"when will she FLY or learn abilities.\" The acting was \"meh\". Where the writing lost me was they took all the film time and focused on too much climax. I.M.O they tried to fit too much in a small window of time. There was no rising action, there was no \"filla\" in the middle to get me excited or guessing. Building up of the script you know what I mean? The part that irritated me the most was I couldn't attach myself to any of the characters at all. She just showed up, beat the bad guy and the rush was over. If i had too I'd say, this won't make it passed season 1. Don't get me wrong I'm rooting for this show, I just don't know if they can fix a script if the whole season resembles this presentation.",

We like hope, we like to smile and we like cute and more than decent special effects. And people who are disappointed too early, i'm sure the DC team is gonna make sure you see Arrow, Flash and Supergirl in the same episode (Episodes hopefully). So, personally i feel this is one of the best premiers this year, kudos to the creators.",

            "content": "I think first 3 episodes damaged its reputation way too much that everything after that was seen negative way .Yeah it can be a little bit women dominated(won't call feminist) show but that is understandable as main cast is a woman & its about her own life also. Also they tried to bring Devil Wear Prada type scenario for Supergirl which is enjoyable if you are not seeking for any personal agenda.If head of Catco Ms Cat Grant is portrayed as feminist then it also had an evil touch with that .So relax men shouldn't be jumping over that negatively(Yes i m a Man) .It showed how single women who can't be with men actually hate men & give different reasons .so not really a feminist agenda but actually showing whats wrong with that view .Atleast our Supergirl don't believe those craps & that should be a relief for Men watching this show.In first 3 episode the Tech friend of supergirl was acting so weirdly that i thought he was not interested in woman , thats how bad first 3 episode was. Characters were acting poorly & giving wrong idea about their own identity ,later after episode 3 every one from supergirl to other cast member's acting got more real & less like \"The Devils Wear Prada\" .I compared it with Arrow & Flash .Well i actually enjoyed it more than Arrow Season 3 & 4 &. this show kinda have similarity with Flash though when it comes to relationship issue it handle better those parts than Flash.Flash sometime over-complicates simple relationship which i don't like . .I don't hate the Character Jimmy Wilson .I kinda like Him .He has a charm as an Actor & i liked him more than Smallville Jimmy Wilson .Though i didn't like Irish chemistry In Flash.I think this show has some smallville touch as fight scenes are not that complex but its more about character's personal struggle .Though i think they should have done fight scene better but i do enjoy the show even when characters are not in any battle mode .These little thinks are Which i miss in Arrow ,Arrow just all about fight enemy ,constant darkness no other relaxing storyline .Supergirl succeed well in that part .Enemy is always there but its the working life in catco or family story which is also important part of the show .Supergirl ballance both work & crime scenario nice way. even in the mid of darkness it give audience a chance to enjoy events at Catco where the head of Catco Ms Cat Grant is really enjoyable & charming character to watch .I would give supergirl 7.5",

            "review_title": "treats the audience like idiots and is a joke",
            "content": "Spoilers, Supergirl starts with a rushed introduction, Kara is given about 25 seconds of back-story of her time on krypton. Instead they skip to her being the stock un-empowered female who must overcome her insecurities as a woman. Again \u0085 let me clarify, an infinitely powerful alien superhero has been re-envisioned to be the standard girl meets world, who has to go and find her inner confidence. Okay! Okay screw it! She didn't land on earth, oh no! We have officially landed on the planet of fruit loops and tap dancing mega penguins! I don't remember much about jimmy Olsen so I don't personally have an opinion, but on principle it's a bad idea to completely change a preexisting character. Kara acts like a star struck teenager the whole episode. The show poorly imitates superman's first flight and show also leaches off of superman constantly. Then even rips off the opening of superman returns. The show treats the audience like they are all basically children. On top of that the entire episode is completely incoherent. This single episode focuses on at least 8-10 plots. Leaving the viewer confused about life and probably a little scared. The lead character is the average geek girl with the intelligence of a teenager and is basically a cookie cutter cut out. The acting is horrible and doesn't convey anything that would make these characters seem like believable people, except Kara's sister. All of the character's traits are overdramatized like a cartoon, again because the company assumes it's audience it too stupid to notice anything unless it talks down to you. The dialogue is either clich\u00e9 or political. At least Kara's sister is actually the only character so far act like an adult, but the rest act like idiots.Finally, the show constantly crams self-defeating and off topic feminist speeches and empowerment messages down your throat. Good female characters don't ever have to point out that they are female or make speeches about their power. If a character is good, you never care that the character is female or male. The music is loud, obnoxious, and distracted from any dialogue or potential atmosphere. At least the FX were OK sometimes, but they need a lot of polish. There is no emotional conflict because there are no believable or relatable characters. The fights are good, the only problem is that the show crams in a bunch of comic relief and one liners like Michael Bay.SUGGESTIONS: This isn't the first failed teeny show this company has made, and teeny shows are the only type this company creates, except supernatural. Start by not ruining a preexisting story and branch into other target audiences, You may be making money off of these shows now, but the best way to gain ratings and money is to make your shows unique and worth while in their own right. Because what you fail to realize is that your audience is not as retarded as you think, and not only preteens watch your channels. Focus on smarter, and believable characters. They should be more capable of avoiding obvious mistakes, clever, and basically not being teenagers so they can \"grow up/develop\". As for this show, start over, if there were a completely different show, with different casts and story lines, I would still try it, and if it were good I would continue watching it. Cancel this current show then in a couple years, start over from complete scratch. Suggestions for Kara: In the superman cartoon, Kara was a more wild teenage girl. That was better than this current show because Kara had a believable reason to have a rough, and have an uncontrolled personality. Her parents were killed, she will never see her home again, and she had to learn to survive in a chaotic alien world, no kid would be unscathed. The first couple of episodes can start with how she grew up and use maybe a few time lapses (NOT FLASHBACKS) of her first 5-8 earth years, and show as much well-paced detail as you can. Then transition to the main story with her still being still young, probably still somewhat a teen, but don't make her an idiotic brat. Also try a two episode premiere so you don't rush. Try a tone that is more like supernatural, not whimsical, maybe not brutal, but realistic. Kara should be smarter and more resourceful, and not entirely rely on brute force, but don't make it the standard flash formula, the flash fails with idiotic brute force so the team convenes and comes up with a convoluted plan that works just in time for the end of the episode. Also instead of the main characters having some generic character flaw like \"un-empowered\", and instead of having everyone else preach to Kara and give her obvious advice, have Kara also be the one giving advice of advice to the other characters Finally try having her be more street smart or stealthy, but maybe still has to learn patience, but this is just preference.",

            "content": "On the \"up\" side, this is a classic comic book adaptation of a DC comic genre that present some interesting moral dilemmas and social commentary on democratic values, the triumph of liberal ideology that is much more nuanced than the days of Superman comic book days in the 1950s in which all coflicts were resolved in 30 minutes, commercial breaks included.On the \"down\" side, the issues here are so heavily framed in the context of a triumphal feminist/pro-LGBT world that it's hard not to see this series as more of a tract for a world destined to be all-inclusive and a celebration of diversity in which no one is an enemy and all behavior and belief is relative since no philosophical foudation exists for moral character.. In this series, feminism and all its benefits, with none of its flaws, wins. All main characters from Kara (Supergirl), to her sister to the US president, corporate heads, etc. are all females in this completely matriarchal society. Males are supporting charachers and accessories, which is probably justifiable in light of George Reeves' and Dean Cain's solitray macho versions. Let's bury them and all hug now.Furher, goodness is defined by the inherent assumption that evil is a vaporous manifestation of a deprived upbringing and/or the misfortune of addictions or bad role models and not a universal metaphysical force that exists in opposition to a reality called \"Good\". All the bad guys are redeemable. I'm waiting for Supergirl to mimic Jack Nicholson's character in Mars Attacks and make the appeal, (opening her arms) \"Why can't we all, just....\" (she wraps her arms around herself) \"get along?\"Most distressingly, the male characters are cardboard cut-outs of either beefy, masculine eunucs (Hank), supportive Ken doalls (James), asexual tech geeks (Winn ) or annoying bad boys who turn into love interests (Mon-El). Character complexity is unfolded more by events than any inherent deep psychological conflict that is part of an existentially and metaphysically messed-up world.In spite of these criticisms, I have to hand it to the director, Chyler Leigh and the writers that the way Kara's sister Alex came out as gay is believable and well-acted--that is, absent any character in her inner circle who would consider a lesbian lifesyle to be morally objectionable, which doesn't exist in this universe.",

            "review_title": "Impressive but worrisome. Edit 1.",
            "content": "Before I write my review, I wrote a review on itunes for this TV show, Supergirl. This review will be similar to what I wrote in itunes but with additional thoughts. I hope that is permissible.I was pretty impressed with the show because of Melissa Benoist's acting with exception on her giggling when watching herself on TV which she saved people. I also was impressed on the storyline with exception of few characters. I like the storyline being different than the Supergirl movie and comics. Just like The Flash on CW because it is different. Two things I am not impressed is the Department of Extra-Normal Operations. It should not be written for the show because the show is all about Supergirl / Kara. But I hope the Operations will ease to exist but before that happens, they should help Supergirl find her way to her true identity and be on her own. The second thing I am not impressed was that Kara told someone else who she really was. I always felt that only whoever a hero's would have a family knows who the hero really is. Of course, there's someone else who already knew who Kara was because Superman told him to take care of her which I don't have a problem. But to confide in someone else...it's kind of awkward. Should have waited until later in the season or next season. One of her family member who is evil should not be in every episode because like the remake of Bionic Woman which an evil bionic woman was in almost every episodes and I got tired of the Bionic Woman show. I hope it won't be the same with Supergirl. Calista Flockhart may have been good actress in Ally McBeal but she doesn't belong in Supergirl. I was not impressed with her acting. But who knows, she may get better in the next few months.I rate this as 10 for the first episode. Will the 10 stars stay in during the 1st season?Edit: I was wrong. I just finished season 2. Yeah, I am so behind. But I was wrong about Department of Extra-Normal Operations. I really like team works. I have always believe in team works in real life. I am also wrong about Calista Flockhart aka Cat. She's awesome! Please bring her back in the near future. Kara could use all the supports she needs from Cat!! Just in case Lena becomes an enemy to Kara, I hope Cat will talk to Lena and get Lena and Kara back to friendship. I rate this a 10!!",

But as time went on it became apparent that Greg Berlanti and the writers wanted to focus more on LGBTQ, social and political issues. Thats when I drew the line. I am all for LGBTQ rights, and all the social and political issues affecting us, but the reason I watch a fantasy show, like Supergirl and all the others is to escape that reality. Instead of showing an action show with a super powered alien, they try to make every episode into a political statement by cramming into the viewers faces, like being hit with a pie multiple times.All of Berlanti's show is like that and I don't any of his shows surviving in the future. People are getting tired of getting political and social issues crammed when watching a superhero show. All we want to see is a superhero show with a good story, great character development and action.

She is older than Superman, smarter than Superman, wiser than Superman and has a full handle on her Kryptonian powers. The fact that she looks younger than Superman is a bonus due to her 17 years in the pod while traveling to Earth. She came to earth to \"protect\" her younger cousin. Even though she looks young, she is far older, when she puts on her costume. At her best Supergirl is a warrior, at worst a warrior mom. But, Hey, its TV. I believe \"Cat Grant\" is the real star of the show because she exhibits the maturity that Supergirl should have. On the other hand Superman is just a lisp away from being flaming. Way to go Hollywood!!",

Wishing for a female super hero, although pretty much in love with Thor, that's another story.Storylines are simple, good always wins, you always know who the bad guy is. Talking about feelings is a thing, Supergirl is all-powerful yet she suffers and process pain like we humans do.\nIt is okay to believe on something, let's call it religion, it is okay to be a lesbian, to be a working mom, to be an orphan or to have bad parents. All these women try their best to make National City a better place. But you get to see them struggle, it is human nature, it is about finding your place in the world. At the same time, the series doesn't take itself too seriously. It is a simple story told in 40 mins. It doesn't pretend to be something other than it is and I love it.You want better plots? More action? More violence? Nudes? There are tons of other shows with that. In fact, that's like 90% of tv shows nowdays. But Supergirl is a little reminder of simpler times, I am grateful for that.",

Superman is said to be at par with Supergirl, is referred to as \"The Man of Steel\", to be the strongest in the Universe and can take on any form alien/human form across planets; however, in this web series, Supergirl is made to look like somebody whos's susceptible to adversities to both forms (Kindly watch Superman prequels/Man of Steel-You'll know instantaneously what I'm referring to, invariably). She gets rather easily bulldozed by shards of glass, is vulnerable to quicksand, amongst others. She's clearly not one who can be referred to a \"Women/Girl of Steel\", perhaps. The director, I'm sure has been privy to other Superman movies, and should he compare Supergirl with Superman, or rather, even make a statement mentioning Supergirl to be stronger than Superman, which, by the way has been made on several occasions in the series, he should have ideally shown the female protagonist to be somebody who isn't vulnerable, or better put, is invincible sans Kryptonite. Food for thought.SO PLEASE DON'T CONVEY A FALSE MESSAGE CONVEYING SUPERGIRL IS VULNERABLE TO KRYPTONITE ONLY, WHEN SHE IS ACTUALLY VULNERABLE TO PRACTICALLY EVERYTHING, EVEN HUMANS ON EARTH. TV BROADCASTERS SHOULD REVOKE RIGHTS PERTAINING TO VIEWING THIS SERIES ONCE AND FOR ALL ACROSS CHANNELS UNTILL IT'S ENTIRELY REWORKED UPON.",

There are many stereotypes depicted, though based upon many true life and common realities experienced, (i.e. under-appreciated assistants, tyrannical employers, romantically unnoticed best friends,secret government agencies etc.) The best part of this show however is its self-awareness (why Super \"girl\"? isn't the real problem you?) and being a fantasy/Sci-Fi platform for bringing to the table further discussion of Women. The most under-appreciated half of the species. The exploration of concepts like how to be an independent successful Woman/Female superhero, while trying to remove yourself from the shadow of comparison to a man (Superman) is unparalleled, and extremely relevant in the superhero TV genre. \"Just because you wear that symbol on your chest doesn't mean you're him. Fighting him would be an honor.\"This is exactly what the average Girl, boy and viewers in the U.S.(and beyond) needs, an empowering Female fronted symbolic message for all Girls that shows even with their flaws, constant struggles, and being undervalued or taken less than seriously in a male dominated world (or TV world Arrow, Flash,Gotham)they can in fact make the world a better place, hold their own, and be more as a Girl or Woman than even a superman.I find that the harsh critical response echoes the popular sentiment and even the shows message, how can a show be taken seriously when revolving around a Female superhero, how can Supergirl be taken seriously in its own right if there are successful male fronted shows doing the same thing? The struggles of both Girl and Woman were never more relevant than now!",

Yes leading women are great but it doesn't mean 95% of the cast must be all female, and even if the majority are women let the show be amazing in its own accord. Black Panther though I scored it a 6/10 used the women in amazing ways, at most times The King felt like he was just an add on to this movie about women in control of everything in his life and his just sent out to fight. Back to the issue, supergirl has potential but they should avoid tacky cliches and sit down to write an actual script.

The special effects and CGI are good and bad. The flying sequences also make you cringe but other than that they are almost as good as those on The Flash. A lot of the fight sequences which occur at night remind me of Arrow which is a good thing and seeing as both shows have the same executive producer it means better things in the future.

Nothing sets this show apart from the other comic book shows currently on the air. Just totally forgettable. Instead of watching this, go watch ABC/Marvel's Agent Carter or Jessica Jones. By the end of the first (double) episode I totally got why they felt Carter was worthy of her own spin-off. She definitely holds her own. It's a smart, well-written well-paced show and shows how you build a comic book show around a smart, strong female character. It's a fairly feminist show without ever ever feeling like one (no big speechifying about sexism or anything, Carter just kicks ass and takes names while her male co- workers/bosses tell her to get them a coffee instead of doing men's work). AC's take on Mad Men-era rampant casual sexism is totally different (and way superior) to Supergirl dancing around it with a 'oh you don't think she can't beat so-and-so villain?

            "content": "I liked this series mostly because the heroine is not one of those modern Hollywood heroines who we are supposed to admire for being more masculine than any man in sight, but rather, she is totally feminine. Yes, she's Supergirl, so she's strong and powerful. But her primary attributes are that she's caring and compassionate and loyal and loving. She's constantly trying to reform the villains rather than destroy them -- her signature line in the series seems to be \"you don't want to do this\".Some reviewers have pointed out that the men in this series are all simplistic cardboard cut-outs. True. While a man can enjoy the series (I did), I think it's intended for women. The male characters are all background and stereotypes: the good guys are just love interests and father figures, the bad guys are all overbearing and arrogant. The real story is about the heroine's personal struggles, and her relationships to her sister and her (female) boss-mentor and her mother. I'm sure you've seen movies where the female characters are just there to be eye candy or sex toys for the hero; this is a role reversal on that, except instead of eye candy, the men are emotional support.I haven't read a comic book in 40+ years so I can't say much about how true this is to the source material. It is weird that they changed Jimmy Olsen from a young, nerdy white guy to a mature, confidant black guy. Why? If they wanted to introduce such a character, why not just invent a new character and give him a different name? The political/social views behind this series make for an interesting study. On the one hand, the heroes all talk liberal, I mean right down to blatant politics like saying they support Hillary Clinton. One episode has the evil politician talking about the dangers of these aliens invading the Earth, and maybe we need to \"build a dome\" to protect the country, surely a sneering reference to conservative calls for a border wall. (Except the sneer doesn't make sense in context, because 90% of the aliens in the series ARE dangerous invaders.) Big government is presented as a positive good -- there's even a scene where one of the main characters, Alex, gives a speech about how the government helps people and people should trust the government. Except the military, who are villains, irrational and violent and oppressive and out of control. The lamest villain in the series is General Lane, an absurd liberal stereotype of a military leader. (Have the writers ever met an actual American military leader? I have. They are NOTHING like General Lane.) Except ... in a curious twist for Hollywood, the main villains of the first season are environmental extremists, who will kill and enslave people to \"save the planet\".Which by the way brings up: Unlike many Hollywood villains, who seem to be evil just for the sake of being evil, the villains in this series have plausible motivations. The boring ones are motivated by personal revenge. But the better ones think they are saving the planet, saving humanity from itself, or defending the country from alien infiltrators. I only found the environmentalists done well enough to be believable, but hey, they tried.",

Mark of the house of El (Hope) The honor of having the privilege to carry that mark as the protector of the whole world in theory but in fact maybe just the USA. They being the one and the same to some people according to the movies. Mostly.I'm a huge Superhero fan but I don't like to put myself in to a box with anything in this life. I'm not a DC fan or a Marvel fan but a fan of good and enjoyable art in the form of a motion picture. Okay maybe the most enjoyable movies and TV generates around the superheros.Mostly I like the ones without any powers but only some gadgets and the raw skill of martial arts. Batman, Nightwing, Arrow, Celina Kyle, Electra, Talia al Ghul, Agent romanoff....That's 3 males and 4 female characters among the superhero worlds with some extreme skill. None of them can fly without an airplane assistance.Supergirl is a woman. They say it's not fair to compare man and a woman when it comes to combat and heavy lifting. Well in the real world at least.Before this show I thought, that the last son of The planet crypton was Carl El the last of their kind. The only hope of any cryptonians existing. Actually the last source of energy was deployed on Clarks ship (the codex) so that he could be sent to earth. But when the supergirl series started, the intro speech led me to understand that, Carls cousin a female cryptonian was launched to earth earlier to have the purpose of being his guardian and a guide. But then some rock in space knocked her shuffle out of course for some what 20 years and she got here much later when Clark was already a superman.Okay so why would we need another supersomething?There already is and has been a superman for a long time.Maybe for the sake of new entertainment? Okay I get it.Then why do they have to be related and from the same planet?Wonder woman is an Amazon brought to life by Zeus the god of thunder. Just an example.Why why why... Yeah okay so this is what we have now so let's examine what we got.We have a 13 year old teenage blondie dropped on to our earth from wonderland who's more of the time crying, complaining or just wondering herself while waving her hands all over the place. This little girl is so confused about everything that she needs to remind herself that she is a girl and that it is awesome that she is a girl and a super at that a superGIRL! No not a boy or a man but a GIRL!I mean if the show was called \"The blondie in pink pyjamas with powers\" only then I would need this information to know what to call her.. Well her name is Kara but I guess she remembers that cause shes not repeating: \"I'm Kara\"...Okay so this Kara was suppose to be more powerful than her cousin the Superman himself what I understood and boy have I ever been more misled and deceived! She get's her ass handed to her like all the time. There even was a scene where she willingly let a normal human being put a suicide helmet on her head and suck her dry of powers out of no reason at all. So shes also stupid.I have no idea what this piece of dirty and smelly sewer water of a series is doing representing the DC universe. A relative to the man of steel.Let's say in the world of TV series the Daredevil is an absolute masterpiece in characters, story, fighting and world.I must add that when Jimmy Olson changed in to the Guardian in supergirl. That was the finest moment of the whole series. But I predicted that they can't keep the guardian cause he would stomp over supergirl so hard that the name would have to be changed so Supergirl instructed that the Guardian can't co exist in her candy land of pink cakes and flowers and nail polish. Yeah I know.. Girls won't share and girls don't play it fare. Arrow and Flash have got their own teams and sometimes even they share the same enemies. But this stubborn little girl with blue laser eyes more wet than blazing all the time want's to lead without any confidence in herself. No this isn't Diana, not the Black widow or canary, not the Catwoman not Talia but just a lost girl without cause living in the city of the man of steel. What a pity cause a cousin of the Man of steel could of had some juice in the making only this is made for children.The fighting is awful just throwing always throwing someone on the wall or through or almost. The CgI looks awful.Man of steel -> Dawn of justice -> wonder woman -> Justice league -> supergirl!!! ERROR!!!Arrow, Flash, Legends, SupergiERROR!",

He stood for Truth, Justice, and the American Way. As the granddaddy of all Superheroes, all heroes have a certain amount of gratitude they owe him, whether they borrowed his super-speed, super-strength, invulnerability, flight, laser-vision, etc, he kicked it off for everyone else. This is why he is often considered overpowered...he is the origin of superpowers as we know them today! In now way does Supergirl's gender make her weak. There are amazing heroes that are female, and I argue that there should be more! But her power set and villain set are copies of Superman, considered by other DC characters to be the greatest hero in the universe. So if he's so amazing, let's just watch a show about him! Kal El is so looked down on these days because Marvel has done a great job with (some) of their movies and Superman seems so boring. Good for them! But Superman, who symbolized America before Captain America was a twinkle in his dad's eye, deserves good writers and good stories!This gives us neither. Villains are Superman knock-offs. Storytelling is under complete control of the left-leaning media. I do not disagree with many of their opinions, but if you're going to make a hero show, do it by story-telling FIRST. Then add a second layer of metaphor for those it pertains to. But you have to make it a story first. Consider Narnia or Lord of the Rings. They are teachings of what Christ did for the world. IN METAPHOR. Are there people that don't believe in God but enjoy the stories without feeling singled out? Absolutely. This should be the same way.Come the third season, you will hear this: capitalism is evil. (What is their other option? Socialism? Fantastic. That worked great for Jamestown, or more recently, Venezuela. Socialism is way closer to fascism than I ever want to get.) Capitalists are sexist. (Isn't the left supposed to avoid stereotypes and profiling? Why is it not racism when the victims are white? Why is it not sexism when the victims are male? The amount of double-standards in today's politics is baffling). Republicans disown homosexual children (Give me a break). Americans hate, spit on, and scoff at Mexicans (some do. Some Americans also take dumps on the streets. Does everyone? No. I'm marrying the most beautiful Mexican in the world this fall.) Religion is for a bunch of crazies. (Religion makes nations better as a whole, statistically speaking. It also can bring about terrorists. Too bad. But todays terrorists are about wanting to force the world to accept their beliefs. Forcing atheism is not that different.)And essentially anyone who disagrees with the writers of this show are presented to be in the wrong, because the left has superheroes on their side. I'm not kidding, the first three or four episodes of season three are like watching CNN.Again, I'm independent and agree with certain progressive views. But I came here to see cool Kryptonian stuff. Leave your crap where crap belongs. If I wanted commentary, I'd listen to podcasts. (I do)",

Annoyed I was when I first saw the trailer ; how can they have cast her as the sweet,cute and naive cousin of Superman?. She'll probably want to Girl-power her up and miss the whole essence of the character ; foregoing the sweet and naive look one should possess without being perceived as ditzy ; which is a fine needle to threat. Supergirl never wanted to be a Superhero - she just wants to have fun with her family and friends. Sure, she enjoys the occasional smackdowns which she does with a smile on her face but she eagerly looks forward to the next family-time with friends and loved ones.Then came the pilot and annoyance quickly turned into anger;everything I feared became a reality. The poor writing and direction,the obvious mirroring of her cousin storyline from another military villain to the bumbling Kara Danvers. They seem to be missing out on the core what makes the EL's so different from all of the other Superheroes. Their secret identity is NOT their Superhero-persona ; it is their human alter ego !. Meaning Barbara Gordon is Batgirl....but Supergirl is Kara Danvers !. Then a voice of reason came to me from an online friend who said: \" you do know that this show is not meant for you , it is meant for the (pre)teens \".And just like that it made perfect sense.Why waste good airtime on character development and inspiring dialogue when you can have her beat baddies week in and week out ?; you know...for the children ...we gotta do this for the children ! . They be spending most of their time on their social media devices anyways and tune in only when there is something serious about to go down, so we might as well...So..if you have kids of your own or you are babysitting , this is a perfect show for them to watch . The dialogue is on nickelodeons level and the CGi is updated to fit the modern day part. The characters are shallow and the plot lines are predicable; everything you want in these days of distract-TV; Image and noise filler while you are doing something else. For the more seasoned TV-viewers , this is NOT for you. That is to say ...this is not an event TV show where you sit down and give your complete attention to ; for it will become boring and tedious quite fast. Unless you too like to watch TV with half an eye on your devices then sure, go for it...at least it doesn't have an annoying laugh track. That always distracts me when i play my mobile games ; like people are laughing at how hard I fail at these things ! .I just hope the execs don't use this show as a test case for female superhero TV shows for the future. Saying \" see ..i told you female super heroes don't do well on the silver screen \". I hope they see it because of the lazy writing,poor direction,failing to understand the subject matter and miscast of lead character.Some may find my review harsh for it is only a pilot . That it is an okay show and it is passable. A great TV writer once penned with some added alteration : \" to a lesser observer, the intensity of lazy writing is so frequent as to border on mass acceptance of mediocrity that it is easy to be missed. but, as has been said by kings and queens, I am not a lesser observer \" We deserve a better class of Superheroes....don't we ?.",

            "content": "If I had written this review when the show first started, my rating would be far higher than it is at presently. But with time, and the finale of the first season, my enthusiasm has been tempered by the few, but enormous flaws in plotting I see. These are more visible in Greg Berlanti's (Executive Producer) other DC-related programs, which have mostly been on for a longer period, so I can only reason that they will continue to mount with time. As it is, the wonderful Melissa B. is still worth watching, despite the plot holes and flaws in character consistency or common sense.1. First big plot problem: Kara pines like a schoolgirl all year for James. Then the last episode comes, and she suddenly thinks of him more like a brother. What?2. Second yawning plot hole: Cat hands the reigns of the Daily Planet and its associated broadcast arm to James Olsen. A photographer. Maybe even an award winning one. But what does he know about running a news organization? It's like giving taking economic directions from someone who went bankrupt several times: you're just giving him an opportunity to lose more money.3. Third: The whole Mon-El thing was handled like a comedy from the fifties. She dislikes him, then loves him. He is a scoundrel, then wants to be a better man, for her. Not impossible, but aren't women more evolved than this?4. Do you Remember a few fights Alex has had with villains with super strength, ones where she used various devices to amplify her strength, etc.? Well, since all of these devices were external, how would they protect her bones, muscles, flesh, and organs from the punishment meted out by the villains? I mean, they showed here going through walls, so it wasn't just being slapped around.5. Numerous Kryptonite encounters that are inconsistent with respect to how much harm it can do her, how close it has to be, how fast it affects her.6. Supergirl supposedly can move as fast as the Flash (see the crossover episodes for verification). Yet she NEVER USES SUPER SPEED when fighting her many foes? Why? Well, the obvious reason is that the fight would be over too fast, but that is hardly good enough.5. Have you ever noticed that any one power gives the person many powers that are totally unrelated? Dreamer can see into the future, and somehow this allows her to create mental ropes that can throw 200-pound men across a room?6. The most recent: Red Daughter is in a savage fight with Supergirl (described as \"epic\" in TV listings, but I thought it was not nearly as harrowing as her battle with Reign, and the repeated flashbacks affecting Alex, although vital to the storyline, diminished the intensity of the situation). Red Daughter apparently can shoot lightning. How does this make the skies go dark? And when Alex steps in to try to help, how is it that this Lex Luther-brainwashed woman, in the heat of a battle to kill Supergirl, has the presence of mind to hold back her strength and not hurt Alex any more than a Lucha Libre wrestler?Thankfully, this season has had as its central focus an extremely relevant plotline to the present, in the form of a sizeable portion of the nation gone rabid over the presence of aliens, even to the extent of a president conspiring with criminals and pardoning one for murder on the grounds that it wasn't a \"human\" that he killed. Maybe some of those with rabies will get some sense filtered through their thick skulls.But generally, as I said, the longer this show is on, the worse it will probably get, based on past experience with the producer's other programs and the writing in general. Watch the very first nineteen, skip to this season, then stop and see how reviews go for the next season before you commit to more.",

There are long time male comicbook fans who will probably hate this because it doesn't fit their mold, their skewed idea of what a female superhero should be. That's OK. This show isn't FOR THEM. It's for the young (and old) female comic fans out there. The ones that want a genuine hero that THEY can relate to. One that doesn't portray women as just some guys fantasy. If you read a negative review of this show, it will PROBABLY be written by a guy, not necessarily, but probably.All of that said, this IS a more light hearted, FAMILY FRIENDLY show. It's not dark, it's not edgy or overly violent. (At least not so far.) I personally think this is a good thing, especially for families. We have enough superhero shows aimed squarely at adults. (I.E. S.H.I.E.L.D., Daredevil, Jessica Jones, even Arrow) I LIKE there is something other than just the Flash that kids can watch & parents can feel comfortable about.So watch Supergirl. It's good. It's not your dad's superhero show. ;)",

To catch my attention, a series has to be considerably better than average. For a few minutes I thought Supergirl might be that series. Maybe it will be, but after the pilot, I sincerely doubt it. I like the Supergirl character well enough. I wouldn't have gotten by the first commercial if she had been macho. In fact, I like all of the main characters. Unfortunately I released an audible groan when it became apparent that Supergirl would be fighting an alien super villain. That has been done before. If the super villain were interesting, if he had a silly sense of humor, for example, then it could still work. Sadly, the pilot's super villain is garden variety and therefore boring. He growls like the standard bad guy professional wrestler and expresses pretty much the same evil sentiments. It could be that these types of series just will not work anymore, at least not anything long-term. But who knows, maybe in the coming episodes something new and special will be added. I might go one more episode, or perhaps just part of one. Like I said, for a series to really catch my attention it has to be above average. The Supergirl pilot was not bad, it just was not above average.",

Not the best acting in the world, but worlds above their previous too shows. Calista Flockhart was really the reason I think it was able to get me to finish the season--she was brilliant and her lines were always the best parts of the script.Then season 2 came around and Flockhart left the show.

I was more than willing to ignore blatant and/or poorly executed feminism if that was the trade-off for a quality piece of entertainment.The only positive I can think of was the plot. Though I struggled to be interested in Kara's private life, the whole idea of Jeremiah's kidnapping was quite entertaining and the link to CADMUS was not only well done but also provided a moment of nostalgic bliss for all us Young Justice fans.In terms of acting, the show really began to disappoint. Melisssa Benoist did her best with the script provided but some of the lines were nothing but cringy. I also shed a tear of pain every time she stood wind her hands on her hips and that huge skirt blowing in the wind. Jeremy Jordan's performance as Winn was rather good but still provided moments of cringe when he was overly nerdy. James Olsen was absolutely slaughtered by the appalling writing. And I am still puzzled to this day as to why Clark Kent's best friend decided to boot up as Guardian.In my watching of Teen Wolf, I realised that Tyler Hoechlin was an amazing actor and did excellently in a dark role. So to have him put on the cape and 'S' of Superman really did bug me. How could someone go from an incredible alpha werewolf to a dreadful representation of DCs most famous hero.Action. The worst aspect of this show by far is the action and special fx. WHY THE HECK DOES SUPERGIRL HAVE BLUE HEAT VISION?! Not only that but just like The Flash, she was horrifically underpowered. Speaking of underpowered, Martian Manhunter. David Harewood performed excellently as both 'Hank Henshaw' and Martian Manhunter yet I was utterly dusgusted to see him thrown into a shed by Braniac 11. The fact that this show was written, then approved really does give me zero faith for the upcoming Black Lightning show, just as much as the obscene costume that he was wearing in the snapshot photo",

            "content": "Another female-driven TV show? YES, PLEASE! It's great when these types of shows come on, you see conventions and stereotypes twisted and it changes your perspectives on things. 'Supergirl' does just that and gives women the ability to see that they can channel their own Supergirl in their own way and use it in their every day lives. Kara Zor-El (Melissa Benoist) is sent to Earth from Krypton to protect her cousin Kal-El. On her way, Kara's spacecraft was hit by Krypton's explosion and sends it to the Phantom Zone. But when she finally lands on Earth she's saved by her cousin, who has now become Superman, and takes her to the Danvers family. Now 24 years old, Kara learns to embrace her powers and becomes Supergirl.I think every girl out there can relate to Kara. I know I can. Melissa's portrayal as Kara is brilliant; funny, a little socially-awkward and very sweet. I see her has the female equivalent of Barry from 'The Flash'). They could be best friends. She even has a crush on James Olsen (Mehcad Brooks), who she's afraid to reveal her feelings to. I feel like we don't get to see these types of girls on television anymore. There's definitely a pressure for girls to look a certain way nowadays and Kara brings back the ideology that girls don't have to succumb to that pressure. Embrace your awkwardness and be yourself. Now, as Supergirl, Kara is strong and determined. Flying into danger, without any regard of her own life. Her only thought is to save the people of National City. I have to admit, I am a bit jealous of how she is able to balance her double life. Only one season in, I can see that this show will continue to be great. I personally think that that there needs to be more shows like this. That shows the real depiction of how girls can be. It sends a strong message to every girl out there to stay true to themselves and have the courage to not conform to society.",

While Supergirl/Kara has kept the to the innocent, super hopeful, always a ray of sunshine characterization, my problem is with the political undercurrents of the show. The writers and producers need to keep their political opinions about the current administration out of the script. They are obviously not fans of the current President and his administration and the writing of the last season CLEARLY shows that. The red power tie, the \"alien\" persecution (which was way over the top), the theme of women empowerment (again, pushed too far it becomes satirical and not empowering)........just way too much. Tone your political views down and get back to the superhero crime fighting. Good defeats evil. Good guys kick bad guys rears!

Anyone who isn't a teenager in his mother's basement, angry that he's never felt the touch of a woman, would know that just having a woman in the titular role does not make something pro women and Supergirl is definitely not pro women. Superman retains his autonomy. He makes it clear, that his role is to help the world but he is not answerable to anyone. By contrast Supergirl has barely pulled her tights on before she relinquishes all autonomy to the DEO, an organisation she is not part of. She allows some man (whose name I don't care to remember) to berate her constantly for the choices she has made about her coming out, something that is entirely her prerogative and hers alone. So desperate is she to relinquish authority she begins referring to this man as \"boss\" so that she can feel comfortable knowing there is a man in charge and she's been relieved of all the pesky decision making. Calista Flockhart's character is an 80s power executive clich\u00e9 who wields authority not by gaining the respect of her subordinates but by threatening them constantly with unemployment. Her management style would garner zero loyalty and trots out the tired stereotype that the only way women can lead is by being super bitches. Writing for Calista is so poor it frequently relies on the old \"oh no, Kara's done it, she gone get fired now\" only for Calista to say \"I like this one, she's got moxy\". In a later episode, Supergirl, not content with allowing DEO to call the shots, acquiesces to an Executive Order. Her alter ego is an American, but Supergirl is not, so why exactly is she required to follow an EO? She's not, but because she embodies a cornucopia of poor choices she allows herself to get \"chickened\" into agreeing to do something. Later, in this same episode, she is being repeatedly blamed for something in classic scapegoating. Ineffectual Supergirl splutters red faced, but is incapable of standing up for herself. Never fear though, boss man is here to save the day and gives her adversary a verbal dressing down. Something, weak, pathetic little Kara can't really manage.. that is until she blows up at her boss because she can say boo to a woman. If there is anymore evidence of how Supergirl is definitely not pro women, Superman battles five Kryptonians and doesn't lose his powers. Supergirl has a five minute showdown with budget Vision and she loses her powers for days. At least in Smallville Kara was shown to be stronger than Clarke. I begrudgingly watched seven episodes before I decided that watching this show was above and beyond the call of duty. I appreciate a lot of the problems with Supergirl are due to the source material (DEO is canon) and female superheroes never work when they're just the female counterpart of a male superhero. This is gender swapped superman. Kara is working in a newspaper office?! (If she's answerable to DEO why isn't she on their payroll?). She has a crush on a man who is crushing on her alter-ego (or would be if this stupid adaptation hadn't made supergirl reveal who she is to everyone of note in the pilot). She disguises her identity by acting clumsy and dorkish with glasses. She speaks to her Kryptonian mother when she needs guidance. The Season Arc villain is shaping up to be a Lex Luthor Light (rich guy whose power is his colossal brain). As huge nerd who is loving Flash and Arrow. I was really hoping DC would continue their trend of killing it in TV. But I guess the inability to write for a female superhero is still a problem in writers' rooms. If you can't write a super heroine with depth go back to feeding the MRAs with an actress with pneumatic boobs who has a talent for placing both her T and A in the shot at all times. At least then someone will be happy.",

More drama and more common sense.

Then some characters are completely wrong.Kara (Supergirl) Nice face, not to bad with her acting. And has a look that makes me believe she is Supergirl. Alex Danvers (Kara's stepsis) Maybe one of my favorites, strong writing on her. She has a great character and acts very well compared to others.Jimmy (now James) Olsen is no longer a white red headed geeky helpless character, he's black, strong and even a superhero now. Now making him a bit more interesting and helpfull is not bad but this is over the top.\nNot a bad actor , but characterwise compared to comic... not working.Winn Schott is the son of Toyman/Toy Maker and not badly written, he would have been a better Jimmy Olsen then whom is portraing him now. Has a nice episode telling his whole story, and gets a nice important spot.Hank Henshaw is the director of the DEO and not a bad guy, protecticve strong and surprised me by being the Martian Manhunter, thing that does bother me though is that Manhunter chose the roll of Hank Henshaw, but now every Martian is black in the series. Are they triyng to alienate them or something like that. Superman is not my favorite he just doesn't really look the part, you expect him to help whenever needed and the he comes out weak 6/10 times. \nI know the show is about Supergirl but making him that weak.\nLiked his story with the Manhunter though.Loved Cat Grants character and God knows why but she made me laugh.Then the guest appearances, Lois and Clark are in there as completely different characters though. So this is DC's idea to put former Superman stars in as a wink. Not really smart choices of actors.Could go on but there are to many.Stories go as expected about all the things in life, they love, hate and fight. They are overjealous some times and that makes it more like a romcom idea but okay. They keep a decent main story line, and it does okay there, one of the main bad things in all Superman/girl etcetera shows is where do they find all this Kryptonite, it's weird a planet from gazillion lightyears away the debris really know how to fly to Earth.The crossovers are decent but dangerous to put on tv I think, what if they screwup the episode lists or you get part 2 first and then 1 and 4 and 3... that's not smart I think.",

Superhero behind bars! Apparently camt use her heat vision through them. Villains let Supergirl out to drain her power, super strength and super speed \"Supergirl\" just walks over and does as told in a room where she is held hostage by 3 humans, 1 of whom was completely unarmed. Or, \"Hey this person can now randomly take a hit that sends SUPERGIRL flying 1000 yards.

No quarenteen, everyone and their family tour the DEO, etc etc)Season 2 is getting out of hand with shoving liberal Propoganda down our throats. Honestly, I expect a bit in just about every show these days but JESUS. From making pro second amendment people look crazy and power crazied, to the endless feminism vomit thrown up all over everything (was really hoping that when Kat Grant shut down Kara over the Super\"girl\" issue that this wouldn't be a problem to it boy or boy was I let down), to the \"look at all the different kinds of love we have on our show!!!!\" (next thing you know they'll have a flipping pedo on the show) to the constant Trump have, the \"We wish Hillary had won the election so now all the good political people and even God are now women\", and the EXTREME COPEOUS amounts of HUMANS ARE RUINING THE EARTH, GLOBAL WARMING!!!!!\nI can't. I just can't. As a self respecting woman who was SO happy to have a strong, good, female super hero show, I just can't. There's no reason to watch this show. It's aweful. Season 1 was pretty good, not great, but good, but I'm only 6 episodes into season 2 and about to call it quits. It's like a feminazi antifa came and threw up all over this script. This show is nothing but a joke, especially compared to the other DC CW shows.Not the female super hero we were looking for, and I certainly don't want politics shoved down my throat in a super hero show.

The thought processes of Supergirl, who should be as smart as Superman, if not smarter as she actually had some Kryptonian education is unbelievable poor. Superman would take a beating and then bounce back but at least his efforts where heartfelt. The lackluster approach of this heroine leaves much to be desired. Simply put, how can she be living on earth for all this time and not be the number one fan of her 'cousin', the sole surviving member of her planet (to her knowledge). the story is trying to incorporate real world events but excludes the technology. If superman were real, there would be youtube videos and tweets and all manner of digital information that she could use as a database for reference. She should know his villains and how they were defeated. The story could have been written in a much better way. The reluctance for her to take up the mantle of Supergirl should have ended in a more traumatic way. The villains also need to be smarter and better coordinated.

When you felt alone in this world, all you had to do is watch its first four seasons and the warmth of super friends and family would fold around you like a fluffy woolen blanket. Then again, if you were older than three or four, you would indeed appreciate its elaborative plot, Kara's cute acting, as well as how there are no filler episodes if you aim at something fun.That being said, Supergirl may not be Arrowverse's best show, it may seem goofy or cheesy, but if you disregard traits common for mainstream television, they well succeeded in reaching groups of different age and gender. Not everything has to be gloom and heavy, some shows are good to lighten up your mood, even if they have to appear a little bit silly at times, just like the review you are reading. I mean, if they disregarded public's criticism on how much of a soap opera it can get, I am sure they would manage to keep its quality intact, as its first three seasons are as intended and most of its fourth is also excellent.In regards to its fifth season, I only watched a few episodes as the show's direction seemed to change in a way it didn't fit my taste. Taking things to a more grand level never works for the small or big screen, unless you got an awesome storyline and big bucks to spend on budget. Many have failed, few have learned and Supergirl is no exception since the attempt to add gravity to the show only spoiled its traditional advantages. As if the tone had to get a bit more gloomy, which is as pointless as it gets, since it stands in contrast to its original inception.Now that the show has reached its final season, I decided to give it another chance, and I won't deny the episodes I enjoyed the most were the ones related to Kara's past. They felt more like original Supergirl material instead of junkyard fest, as the rest is full of incomprehensible dialogues, poor fighting scenes, neon costumes (probably purchased during a Halloween Sale), plus their flashing lights would only look good for Christmas decoration. I almost feel sorry for the actors who once were a part of something decent and now they hear, \"relax... in no job there's shame\", everytime they share how they make a living nowadays. Apologies for my bad humor, as the review is only meant to be fun, but the thing is expectations are indeed low for the remaining number of episodes.All in all, it's not an amazing show, but it's not a bad one either. If you never watched it before, better imagine a superhero family edition of Emily In Paris. Personally, I'll give it a strict 5/10, which, to me, means it's definitely worth watching, at least when it comes to the first three or four seasons. As for the rest, I will reserve judgement, at least till the series eventually concludes.",

            "content": "So, first up. I have not read the Supergirl comics. Did read some stuff on the internet. Am pretty much caught up on Arrow, Flash, Daredevil, A.o.SHIELD (I know the latter two are Marvel).So the first episode is brilliant in the same way that I loved Eureka and Warehouse 13. It's cheesy, it's corny, it's clich\u00e9 and has caricature characters. Emotions follow up waaaay to fast (and I really mean, waaaay to fast. Have an emotional family reunion and the first tear has barely dried and she wants to fight). It makes me wanna grab the story, twist in around in my own version. I really like doing that. After that, this level of corniness dwindles down and the quality goes up. Yes, it's not a high quality and there are too many moments that don't add up even when following that universes rules. The amount of times she jumps in her costume when she doesn't need it is remarkably high. Moreover there are many times she speaks of Supergirl like it is a role model and I mean in the ultimate, can't live up to ideal. Or the boss which tries to be strict, bitchy, I-don't-care-bout-you boss, who suddenly takes Kara out for drinks after an outburst. Or how fast a new villain gains powers and immediately masters them in a single hour.However, as episodes go on, it improves. Not fast enough to get to the level where Arrow and Flash are, but well enough to have faith this show will continue to be very enjoyable without the need to rely on super corny over the top parts. Even though they are still in there {WARNING, SPOILERS COMING UP} Like its predecessors in the DC universe. More and more characters become fleshed out. Bad guys become gray or even kinda white (as we learn out that HH is in fact JJ/MM) or gray characters become black (Maxwell as the immoral technocrat). The events in episode 7 are most interesting, especially the part in the DEO basement. Also, miss Grants observance also brings an interesting change, for how long she's been too nice to Kara was starting to get a bit... bothersome. So I'm curious how that's going to flesh out.So, are the flaws gone? No. There are plenty of flaws. Plenty of time problems. For instance a call to Supergirl from the DEO office of a break-in (ep 8) yet DEO arrives first. Or location problems: from a busy first aid center to a deserted street in too short time. Or the continuous need to discuss Supergirl to 'strangers' while in Kara form. It's a bit too... self-centered(?) for Kara tbh. So yeah, it has its flaws, and sometimes they're quirks, sometimes they are a bit annoying. But it's all coated in a sugary sweet honey delight of cute innocence and hope. Especially the latter. Hope is important and from what I've seen so far. It gives me hope for an increasingly better series.",

            "content": "A series that stays true to Superman's origins. After all, for those of us old enough to remember, we first saw George Reeves' Superman playing gun-control man Wyatt Earp, disarming mobs of bigots along with his feminist girlfriend Lois Lane (Phyllis Coates) and a clearly gay Jimmy Olsen (the late Jack Larson).That's because Superman was essentially a fatherly-like moderate Rockefeller Republican. Now, in a post-Strom Thurmond/Dixiecrat perverted extremist GOP, they're called RINOS by Trump and his ilk (AKA phony conservatives).Unfortunately, there's plenty of these either/or Trumpettes who approach various entertainment genres with the same kind of \"protective\" zeal that dyed-in-the-will fundamentalists \"guard\" the bible they worship , er, I mean, God (but then, their God is merely a book, but that's another topic).Among the most recent favorite targets of Trumpette geeks are Star Wars, Black Panther, and... Supergirl.All three shows commit the same \"sin\" in that they depict non-WASP heterosexual males and/or depict heroes who actually earn their status (i.e. Rey) as opposed to being \"fathered\" in (kinda like Trump) and when these shows do \"dare\" to depict people of color, women, gays in their narratives then the Trumpettes will sophomorically label the show \"political.\" In other words, the Trumpette geeks protect their visions of deities who wear underwear outside of their pants, childishly confuse ethics with patristic morality, and will zoom in for the kill like white-robed fellas armed with burning crosses.At the center of Supergirl is a ... gasp... girl who has the same peers as SuperMAN. Worse, she has a gay sister, and ...(drum roll roll please) an African-American Jimmy Olsen (that's a heart attack waiting to happen).Shoo these cavemen Trumpette geeks back into their caves and enjoy Supergirl for what it is -a breath of fresh air.The cast is uniformly superb, most especially Ms. Benoist who is as quintessential a Supergirl as Christopher Reeve was Superman. Her rapport with Cat Grant (Calista Flockhart AKA Ally McBeal) in Season 1 is gold. After all the somber gray Zack Snyder Batman we've been inundated with as of late, Supergirl is fun escapism-right up there with \"The Adventures of Superman\" and \"Lois and Clark.\" Like those, Supergirl is destined to become a classic.Tyler Hoechlin makes for an unconventional Superman in Season 2 (in much the same way that both George Reeves and Dean Cain (Kara's adoptive father here) are now considered somewhat unorthodox and that's all for the better)..\nFormer Super-heroines Lynda Carter and Helen Slater also make appearances. The cliff-hangers, white-hot pacing, and character development are enticing. Despite not having a consistently great villain until Season 3 (Morgan Edge as played by Adrian Pasdar), Supergirl, like Spiderman, is made the more interesting by struggling with her job, identity crisis, and relationship problems.She's the perfect superhero for millennials who (generally and thankfully) aren't saddled with my generation's too many to count hangups.",

Are there things that are bad? Absolutely. The script can be downright cringe-worthy at times. The effects are generally okay, but there are times when the CGI is awful. The plot is also extremely convoluted and wandering. It seems directionless at times. The show can also be exceptionally cheesy/campy at times. HOWEVER-The characters that they develop here are absolutely fantastic. I love the sisterly relationship between Kara and her adoptive sister. I love the owner of the newspaper she works at. She has exceptional depth, and is just a badass. I love the Elon Musk-esque super rich guy (Lord is his last name I believe). His backstory has heart and his motives are easy to understand. The controversial character is, of course, Jimmy Olson. I understand that he is not the same character from the comics, or the old Superman movies. Myself not being a particularly large DC fan, and not being a reader of comics in general, I had no problem with the character of Jimmy Olson. He's funny, useful, interesting, and well-acted.I also really appreciate the tone the show takes on. Marvel's Netflix shows, as well as DC's most recent movies and TV shows, have an exceptionally dark and depressing tone. Some people enjoy that, and that's fine. I am not one of those people. I enjoy that this show is fun, that it is just a good bit of escapist entertainment. I can watch it for hours and not feel fatigued.Overall, I really enjoy this show. It has its faults, for sure, but in general it is a fantastic time.",

            "content": "It is extremely hard to enjoy a show when the main protagonist is so unlikable. For me it felt like Supergirl (Kara) acts completely selfish throughout the entire show. She seems to have no regard for her companions in the show and only realizes she's in the wrong after someone points it out to her. Unfortunately she never grows as a character in this regard, and she never evolves for the better throughout the entirety of the show. If you've seen the other CW show Arrow, you'd know the main protagonist in that show, Oliver, is going through constant character arcs throughout all 8 seasons. Supergirl as a character has none of this, and in my opinion is the biggest flaw in the entire show.The supporting cast saves the show at times, and Lex Luthor is easily the best part of the show, which says a lot when Lex is in-fact a Superman villain, not a Supergirl villain. The villains overall in this show are mediocre at best, but Lex was written very well and does justice to the character. Speaking of writing, it is remarkably poor. It doesn't help that each season is about 20 episodes long at 40 minutes apiece, and they have to stretch out each season to fit those requirements. But even so, the episode to episode character interactions and plots are very simplistic and nothing will surprise you.Lastly, this show chose to promote social justice issues in a very blatant way and it comes off more distracting than anything else. I honestly didn't understand the argument of \"real world politics have no place in entertainment\" before this show, but I think I get it now. Not to say you can't promote an agenda in your show, but it needs to prioritize being entertaining above all else. Unfortunately this show went the opposite direction, and comes off as forcing rather than enlightening if that makes sense.If you decide to check this show out, I'd recommend that you stop after season 2, as it kind of drops off in my opinion and you won't be missing much. Overall I found Supergirl to be an average at best show, but as a DC show I think it favor more poorly as there are way better options. Finally, I wrote my quick thoughts for each season below so I wouldn't forget.Seasons ranked best to worst: 2(6/10), 1(6/10), 4(6/10), 5(5/10, 3(5/10), 6(4/10)Season 1: This is arguably Kara's best season as a character, and this is mostly due to the character of Cat Grant. This is the only season where Kara has an authority above her to limit how selfish she can act. This also in part to her being a new hero and not having an ego quite yet. Kara is enjoyable in this season, so is Cat. The supervillain is forgettable, and Max Lord was fun, but never returns after this season which was disappointing.Season 2: Probably my favorite character, Mon-El, is introduced here, and is an extremely refreshing and fun addition. It also helps that he's the complete opposite of Kara, and actually rubs off on her making her better in the process. The supervillain again is forgettable, and Cadmus was interesting but again has no long term impact. This season is the best in my opinion and I would recommend stopping here if you were considering watching this show.Season 3: Unlike the last 2 seasons, this season has no fun characters. Mon-El was ruined, making him a serious, responsible veteran superhero rather than the fun inexperienced hero he was last season. This season isn't particularly bad, its just unremarkable and not very entertaining, which I guess makes it inherently bad. The supervillain isn't that forgettable this time, but isn't good either. She's basically just an obstacle for Supergirl.Season 4: This season was so shocking to me for so many reasons. First, this was Supergirl's worst season as a character. She goes so far in an effort to keep her identity a secret that she forces one friend, who is trying to give up his violent ways, to erase the mind of an innocent DEO officer. She also makes the same friend wipe the minds of all her other friends of her secret identity, including her sister. This makes no sense to me, because the whole reason behind keeping her identity a secret is so her loved ones are safe, but erasing your sister's mind is how you go about doing that? Seems a little selfish to me. This season has the best villains by far. Sam Witwer's character is very entertaining and at some points was making more sense to me than the main protagonist. Lex Luther was also introduced in this season and makes a very strong debut. This season also has the strongest political message push throughout the whole show, and this is when I noticed how poor the writing really was. I was on the side of the villains for most of this season, because the season was written particularly strong in favor of the villains, giving them sympathy. This worked too well, cause the villains were making the most sense. Then of course Supergirl wins in the end, and you can't help but think that she didn't earn it, and it was gonna go her way regardless of what happened in the season. Lastly Brainy was made a series regular this season, and is rather fun and entertaining, almost to the level of Mon-El. For me, Brainy and Sam Witwer's character saved this season.Season 5: This season is only better than season 3 because Lex Luthor is in it. It says a lot to me that this show had to resort to using strong villains from other superheroes to keep it interesting. Especially when the superhero they are borrowing from is Superman, whom they make an especially strong effort to say Supergirl is better than throughout the show That should tell you everything you need to know about this season; its ok at best.Season 6: The worst season in my opinion. I found the Phantom Zone arc to be boring. I found the the villains to be boring. The characters have all become boring to me at this point. I don't know if boring is worse than bad, but I'm starting to think it is. I literally just saw the episode where Alex and Kelly adopted a daughter, and day one they shove their whole lives into her, including the superhero part. She's like 5, give her some space and let her be normal. These are the kinds of characters this show hopes you find inspiring.",

They did show after show that addressed serious issues, and they weren't even subtle about it. A fictional series, especially one based on books or comics, is not the platform for such material. It started out as a good, fun show, if a bit shallow. But somewhere along the line, it stopped being about the lives of superheroes and started feeling like After School specials. Fiction should be an escape from the real world, but when they bring the real world into a show like this, it ruins it for many people.One thing about DC comics and shows that can be frustrating is that there are lines they just don't cross. Batman won't use guns. Most of them won't kill. Supergirl's line has always been even farther back than most of the others, and they would often argue over whether someone should even be incarcerated or not. At the end, they didn't even punish the villains. Their fate was something they did to themselves, leaving our heroes' hands clean.All that said, with one notable exception (William's murder), I liked the ending. It wrapped up nicely and everybody was happy. Sure, it was kind of a Mary Sue ending, but it still left me with a smile because we finally got that escape from reality.",

Despite the interesting and creative start and casting picks the writers of Supergirl have repeatedly buffered their time slot with pointless backstory on how awful and racist the police state in Earth-38 is. I'm not opposed to the casting of an actor for a role traditionally portrayed as a different race. But Supergirl's writers seem to spin the oppression angle into every cast they make solely to fill their show with 5 minute long tangents about oppression and what I would consider \"Spider-Man\" like quips to remind you that the James Olsen of Earth-38 is in fact a Black Man. Not to bash Mehcad Brooks for his soulful portrayal of James Olsen. The writing has progressively gotten lazier since the first season, and while interesting and engaging plotlines still exist even in season 4 they fall short of redeeming the series in the glaring light of the character regression that takes place. Prior to season 4 I would give Supergirl 6 stars, but the suspension of disbelief required to stomach season 4 is so all consuming I cannot help but rate this title 3 stars.",

            "content": "OK, this is a TV show. About a comic book superhero. But it wasn't really supposed to be about saving the world, was it?A great deal of the pre-buzz surrounding Supergirl was its feminist vibe, with commercials showing young girls being empowered by the message. Well, forget all that, because Kara is so intimidated by her boss she won't demand the correct pronunciation of her name, thinks nothing in her life has value except her alien powers, can't go ten minutes without comparing her worth to her cousin, and is so unsure of her own feelings she can't set clear emotional boundaries with an office crush. Not to mention her menial job (that somehow affords her a corner highrise apartment, but I digress). I mean, if she's had a burning in her heart to save the world her whole life, why not make her a cybersecurity expert? She could still work for the same media empire and wouldn't have to rely on a police scanner on a coffee table.For a show cocooning itself in feminist armor, though, the worst violation also happened to be a major plot point. The major turn at the end of the second act sees our hero ASKING PERMISSION to be a hero... from the director of a shadowy government agency... an alpha male. I can't recall of another origin story where the titular hero had to ask to be ungrounded so they could go save the day. Perhaps the marketing department thought this was too assertive.Corporate thumbprints are all over this pilot. Odd product placement (whiskey featured in a show aimed at families?), retread reveal so lame they put a lighthouse on it (the plane crash), and my favorite, a front-runner for the Heartless Legal Team of the Year at WB for not allowing any mention of the words \"Superman\" or \"Clark Kent\".My concern is the network will keep up the monster-of-the-week recipe they've established so clearly in the pilot. That will get old. Fast. Also troubling is the \"friendzone\" relationship they have going with their Superfriends (but \"we're not calling ourselves that anymore\"). Get the guy or move on.I gave this four stars because I see potential IF they loose the shackles. Show Supergirl standing up to the superspies and have them follow her lead. Deal with the fugitive round up, or at least make them interesting. I'm thinking space plague harmless to Earthlings. Perhaps Calista Flockhart could remind Melissa Benoist how much guff Ally McBeal didn't take, short skirt and all. And for goodness sake, give Dean Cain some lines. The ironic humor in having him deliver fatherly advice could be a goldmine.",

We want to see a young superhero lady who- yes, knows how to have fun; but more importantly a person who can instill confidence in us Earthlings- like Superman does. We want a character who will live a long time, who can be remembered even after the show is over. At least this should be a platform to bring Supergirl to the level of the other major superheros like Wonderwoman.At least they should try to make SUPERGIRL more appealing for those who are a little bit older.All in all, the show has a potential assuming the coming episodes will have straightened out the few kinks here and there.

            "review_title": "I can't believe I watched the whole thing...",
            "content": "I have an embarassing confession to make. I watched all 6 seasons of this garbage and I even so so excited about it at one point that I was recommending it to friends. I shouldn't have. It's objectively terrible, gets worse the longer it goes, and the potential I thought I saw in the first season and a half was largely me projecting my ideas onto the character/plot.So, what did I like about it? Why did I stick around so long. Well, for one thing, the initial core cast was amazing. Melissa Benoist is OUTSTANDING at the particular things she's asked to do. The show wants her to be the quirky girl from every romantic comedy. And she does. And she's brilliant at it. And then it wants to her cry alot because for SOME reason 11-14 years after arriving on Earth she's still raw about Krypton's demise to the point where she spontaneously breaks into tears about it...alot.Calista Flockhart is an A+ as Cat Grant, the generic mean boss. I say generic not because of Flockhart's performance, but because the character really is uninspired...it's Flockhart's performance that gives her legs. Chyler Leigh is excellent as Alex. Some of the other initial core actors are solid as well, but those three really carry the show in season 1 and their chemisty is what tricked me into thinking the show was going to be better than it was.Over time, the acting declines as weak supporting characters with bad actors are added and become regulars. Lena Luthor is terrible. Braniac 5 is even worse. Even some of the original group decay and get worse. Winn Schott's portrayal by Jeremy Jordan spontaneously goes from low confidence nerd in season 1 to arrogant tech genius in season 2. James \"Dont call me Jimmy\" Olsen is miscast as a confident sex symbol, but Mehcad Brooks makes me like him anyway (just wish his name wasn't Jimmy Olson) in season 1, but becomes increasingly terrible with every half season from there forward as the writers stop having ANY kind of sensible role for him and Brooks kind of seems disinterested...not that I blame him.The effects are ... well, I'm not going to say good, but I will say they're good FOR THE BUDGET that I imagine the show had. But again...they get worse the longer the show runs. Likely declining ratings further reduced the budgets.The action is ... just bad. As good as Benoist is in character moments, she may be the stiffest and worst action actress I have ever seen. Now, let's be fair to Melissa. This MIGHT not be her fault. She's wearing a cape that I've heard is VERY heavy. She's in wedges. I'm not sure why, Benoist is plenty tall. Her outfit has foam muscles that ... don't REALLY sit where a real person's muscles would be. And she does alot of stuff with effects and wires that can limit her moves. It's also possible the stunt coordinator just sucks, though Alex Danvers has a few moments from time to time where she's doing better action than Melissa ever gets to do. The Arrow, a show with strong overlap had excellent stunts. The Flash was effects heavy, yet the action was quite decent...for awhile. In season 1 there are a COUPLE choice action moments. But anytime Melissa is asked to throw a punch or...god forbid, RUN. One wonders if she was birthed into the world fully grown and didn't have a childhood because the poor woman just can't move naturally.The comedy was quite fun in season 1, and even early season 2. However, the longer the show ran, the more it sort of FORGOT that aspect of itself. Which is a shame as I rather found the show quite funny early on and it was a big part of my enjoyment. The banter between Kara and Cat in particular. Mon-El was very funny in early season 2. But by mid season 3, I cannot honestly think of a single funny moment. Not that the show wasn't trying, but I think part of the problem was that it forgot that Benoist and Flockhart were it's funniest actors...and Flockhart was gone and Benoist's character seemed to no longer get jokes to tell.But far and away the greatest crime of this show was the writing. We're talking about MASTER CLASS level writing...of what NOT TO DO as a writer. No one associated with this show should ever work as a writer in Hollywood. This is a show that took legions of great ideas and story seeds from the comics, both the Superman and Supergirl comics, and as I wasn't familiar with this, I took these seeds as implying that the show's writing was coming up with wonderful and interesting ideas that I thought would be explored over the long term. Instead, they were generally resolved in one episode and never explored again.We were told (out of the blue) that Kara had an anger management problem. Sounds cool right? How interesting to explore a god-tier superhero with anger problems. Nope! Resolved in one episode.We see Kara longing for Krypton and not willing to embrace Earth as her home as the show adapts the Black Mercy storyline from Superman better (IMHO) than the comics...except all the issues from it are wrapped up, and are barely hinted at again.We see Kara encounter a bit of her culture, and realize she misses and be worshipped as a god by a cult in season 3....but neither plot point is ever revisited.We see Kara spontaneously develop claustrophobia after a psychic attack and are told it's from her time in space. Makes sense. Sounds interesting...but don't get attached, it's resolved in 40 minutes including a moment where she busts out of an elevator from inside in a way that should have wrecked her identity...but didn't. Somehow.We get the show's version of Red Kryptonite where Supergirl is starting to go bad...and it's going to be really bad....and then...nope. Nothing. She literally hurt no one. She came close. She wrecked some cars. But nothing. To the show's credit, Supergirl does have some PR problems because of this...that last all of two episodes?Kara and Alex abuse their position an lock Max Lord up extrajudicially! My god! An actual judgement error from a Superman style character. How potentially interesting!!! Nope. Resolved in a couple of episodes, none of it public, ZERO lasting impact.Nothing this character does has any lasting impact on her. She does change a bit, but not in any way that really matters. She goes from dorky assistant to fledgling journalist to experienced journalist....and that's about as close to 'character change' as we get.The show also frequently seems to forget it's own storylines and characterizations from scene to scene. There are literally episodes where in Scene A, a character weighs in passionately that you must NOT to thing X, and then later in the same episode, with NO PRECIPITATING CAUSE, the same character will go the other way. Characters regularly serve the scene and plot of the week rather than the plot serving the characters. Kara will be whatever she's needed to be for the week. So will Alex. So will Jonn. The show doesn't even seem to remember how long Kara has been on Earth with varying timeframes in different episodes. Like...didn't you write it down? Don't shows like this have a 'Show Bible' to keep continuity straight?But of all the things about character and story that irk me the most, the worst is that they turned Supergirl into 'Superman in a skirt'. That's all she is. She's a spinoff character in the view of this show.Now, let's be clear, no writer of the show would SAY they think that. Indeed, the first season tries SO HARD to distance Kara from Superman that it won't even SAY HIS NAME. But Supergirl, as a character, should be a character study of 'What if Superman wasn't perfect'. Superman is an all-powerful god-like character. An unaccountable BEAST with every power imaginable for any situation. But you can't explore the ramification of that because despite being an alien, he's raised on Earth and is not an outsider. You can't explore him being tempted to abuse his power or knowledge...because he's a paragon. At least, how he's most commonly portrayed. He's Hope. Being perfect and something to aspire to is kind of his THING. And that's why he's BORING.But Kara is the opposite of Superman. Not in gender, that's the least of the ways she differs from him. Sure, she's a spinoff, but in the comics, and in how she SHOULD BE, she's his polar opposite. She grew up on Krypton. She's an outsider. She's out of her element on Earth and is a perfect lens to provide an outsider's look at human society, something Kal-El can't do because he's human in every way but biology. She's been through immense trauma and is still a teen, the immaturity of which gives her permission to act rashly and stupidly and have it excused by the audience. She can be sad, angry, afraid. She can react badly to humanity. She can misunderstand. She can be TEMPTED to use her power unwisely...because she's NOT a paragon. Kara Zor-El is INTERESTING in a way that Kal-El can't be.Except, the show ruins all of that. It alters her background and personality to turn her into 'Superman in a Skirt'. The show wants HER to be the beacon of hope. Any mistakes she makes are resolved immediately and without any lasting consequences. She arrives on Earth more than a decade ago so that by midway through the show, she's been on Earth longer than Krypton and is no outsider. She becomes a journalist because .... well .... you see ... Well, okay, the show never REALLY answers that question other than that it's the job right in front of her and it makes her more like her cousin. The show even shoe-horns in Superman characters just to remind us that despite the long blonde hair, she's just the same as Superman! Or, except stronger...so says Superman and everyone around Kara...repeatedly and gratuitously and for no reason. Seriously, characters will bring it up with no prompting at times.I have dozens of other complaints from the nonstop politics to being kind of BAD at inspiring girls, but I think I'm out of space.",

I didn't get to know Kara as a total nerd before she suddenly became a superhero, the show also never introduced Alex as a normal person, so there goes my \"surprise\" for her being a secret agent. the forced romantic triangle didn't really add anything to the equation. and the bad overacting from about... everyone except Calista Flockhart is the real Deal breaker for me. the \"one episode plot\" is also something I don't really like in this show but I guess it's an audience thing. I tried giving this show more chances, but the relative ease with which Supergirl deals with older, experienced fighters that are as strong or stronger then her is just unbearable. I really wanted to like this show, I do watch regularly and enjoy Arrow and The Flash, but the CBS really did a terrible job with this show, and instead of focusing on Kara's frustration from spending her years as a girl scout and giving her an interesting dark side, the CBS chose to make her the perfect hero, which as boring as a superhero show could get.",

            "review_title": "Starting to Lose Interest",
            "content": "Ah, Supergirl. I really used to like this show, and I pretty much liked anything to do with Supergirl as I think she's one of the most interesting of all the underappreciated DC super heroines and not just a female Superman. But this past season (5) I found myself rapidly losing interest and liked only two or three of all this season's episodes.\nThe CW shows in general have been waning in content and wandering off in so many directions that you lose focus on what the shows are supposed to be about - which is the Superhero or Super heroine for which they are named after.\nIn this case: Supergirl. But the topics ranged so widely this season - ancient Gods and the evils of VR tech and of course anything that Lex Luthor was doing (although Lex is never a bad addition to the plot) - that you could have taken Supergirl entirely out of the script and added any other Superhero and you'd have essentially the same story.\nAdd to that the annoying trend in all CW shows, including the promising new series Stargirl, which is: everyone has to be either a Superhero or a Super Villain and the show becomes just another run of the mill action story, nothing special about it.\nBecause - In a world where everyone is either a Superhero or a Super Villain, what is the point of even using such labels.\nIn Supergirl, it was exciting in the first season to see this Super heroine finally come to life on TV screens. But then, like all other CW shows her story became about working with a team (I swear, if I have to watch another CW Superhero join a team I'll scream!)\nAdmittedly, it's harder for screenwriters to write interesting stories for shows that focus on just one character. That requires more creativity on the writers' part. Producers are not willing to take a chance on writers' creativity when ratings are concerned, so they throw in everything from not widely read comic book arcs to any comic book hero or villain that hasn't yet appeared on TV, hoping to grab more fans and have more variety in the episodes, this at the expense of the show's original Superhero who's significance and (seemingly powers) fade more and more with each passing season. Initially, kryptonite was the only thing that could stop Supergirl. Now, basically any Super Villain with a powerful enough weapon can hurt her.\nI realize this trend happens to some degree in the comics too and there's nothing wrong with having other Superheroes work together now and then, but the whole series shouldn't be like. You only need one main Superhero and one main Super Villain in Supergirl, Flash, Arrow, and Stargirl.\nAlthough, that is ostensibly the premise in these shows, that is not how they are presented in the latest seasons of these shows and I think it is effecting the content because the audience is now seeing that they're all basically the same and nothing special about the main Superhero or Super Villain.\nAlso, as to the Supergirl comics that the show is based upon: Kara is traditionally supposed to be a teenager in high school, not a twenty something reporter, which makes her seem more like Clark Kent and therefore a female Superman. If the show had cast her as a teenager as she often is depicted in the comics, I think it would've set the tone for a more creative show that was more faithful to the comics as well. But we got what we got and though not a teenager Melissa Benoist is a great actress who does however embody the youthful spirit of the comic book Supergirl.\nA final note: one good thing in season 5 of Supergirl is the toning down of the political message. Whether you agree with their politics or not, most people do not like to be told what to think when all they want to do is watch a good superhero story.\nPolitical messages are okay now and then as was used in select episodes of the Star Trek franchise to make a point, but doing an entire season on a political message is a great way to start a whole new show based on that message and NOT on what comics are about, which is to enjoy the vicarious depiction of super lives in these heroes and heroines. Seeing them on TV is even better for anyone who read the comics as boys or girls or even as adults today. In fact, that kind of entertainment might even be an escape from the politics of today and it'd be a shame to lose it or rather lose the interest of viewers, thereby further lowering the ratings.\nEveryone can't be pleased. So why not do what comics do best: escapism in the most fun and interesting way?",

I watch all 4 shows and enjoy them for the most part. I don't care that the continuity is not spot on or anything like that. I like a fresh take on things a change here and there. I loved batman v superman and all the other dc films. But as good as this show is the PC crap needs to go. I have no problem with anything else. The show can be a great show! It doesn't need to tie in current events, politics, and racism towards white men. These things are getting old and people just want an escape from the world. You cant do that when its slammed back in your face every episode. I hope the writers get this hate out of there heart so i can enjoy a good show. Otherwise I ll just find something else to do with my time.",

Dean Cain as the \"deceased\" step father (played Superman on Lois and Clark). The show is cute and entertaining, and has a positive message. Lastly Calista Flockhart is incredible as Cat Grant as she goes from hateable to awesome in seconds flat. Melissa Benoist recreates quirky, awkward and adorable beautifully, and it is always cool to see classic DC characters pop up like the Martian Manhunter. Great casting.

But what show based on a comic isn't? What I find special about this series is it's willingness to show us that heroes are born female as well. But let me explain- this is in no way SAYING that men can't be good heroes and women are better than men. No, it's trying to show us the subtlety of the struggle a lot of women face when trying to make a name for themselves, and the lack of strong female role models we have growing up. Supergirl has always lived in her cousin Superman's shadow, finally realizing its okay to come into herself. And the Melissa Beloist who plays Supergirl is PHENOMENAL in the role. She feels so authentic, and is so relatable as the quirky yet fierce Kara Danvers. She shows us that it is okay to make a name for yourself, have strong female role models like her boss Cat, and have a loving relationship with your family while still being strong. I appreciate that a lot. I don't think there is anything in this show that promotes this \"feminist agenda\" people have been so harshly degrading it for. Yes, feminism is present as feminism simply means equality of opportunity. But what's feminist about it is Supergirl's journey to find herself separate from Superman's shadow, having a female boss who has power and understands how to use it, and having a sister who is as rugged and strong as the male-dominated field of national security that she works for. Supergirl is nothing without her team of friends to help her, showing that its not being female that makes her strong, its being able to accept help from others and find role models in men as well as women. I love this show and I think it deserves a chance. There aren't many out there like this that are willing to put their ratings on the line to give little girls an opportunity to see that you can be a woman and save the world.",

Arrow is great, I'm in the middle of season 4 and i still enjoy it. I'm actually watching in chronological order and the first few episodes of Legends leads me to believe that i will enjoy it as much as flash and arrow. Arrowverse hit a niche when Supergirl came along. There were only a few episodes that were very enjoyable (can't recall the exact ones). I wanted to get through Supergirl so bad because I'm dedicated to the Arrowverse but after the \"Bizarro\" episode i had enough. I guess this show is missing something. Maybe Cat Grant is annoying or maybe they need some different characters to buffer up the show. Flash is comical, fun to watch, and just a great well rounded show. Arrow gives you that batman feel. Its also fun how they introduce new characters to spin off shows as well as flash. Legends, obvious there is history with the characters and we expect a lot from them which i think they exceed expectations. Supergirl doesn't have nothing to pull me in. I stopped watching it for the moment, don't know when i'm coming back to it maybe next year when i find out there are some more crossover episodes in the Arrowverse with Supergirl or maybe when the Live actions titans confirm that she will be in it 2018.",

I'm about to binge watch series 2 and I'm really looking forward to it. Maybe that's what made me enjoy it so much. Watching it without the interruption of ads, having to wait a week for the next episode or dealing with a mid season break means I could really get in to it. I love Melissa Benoist who plays Supergirl. She's adorably dorky as Kara but switches so well in to hero mode as Supergirl. The perfect choice. I also love her sister Alex (Chyler Leigh) I loved her in Greys Anatomy before this. A fantastic actress. She cries so convincingly that I often have to wipe away a tear! My point is - the actors are great and most of the characters are a joy to watch evolve. I was particularly taken back by Calista Flockhart. She's fabulous as Cat Grant. I've probably rambled on too much but I feel like this little gem deserves more credit.

I hope Supergirl and Jimmy's romance gets hot and heavy if for no reason but to introduce people to the 21st Century. I'll admit I also watch to see where it goes.

A lot of people get angry because it strays to far from the comics and others because it sticks to close. However, once you seperate it from the comics you are able to enjoy a light hearted take on an all too forgotten superhero (they do chuck in some good references to comics though). The show takes an interesting tone: making the difficult path of sci-fi, romcom, action. But I understand how dangerous this is also because of the flash doing something similar. I love all arrowverse shows, but they all have the rocky points (arrow season 4 !!!!). Supergirl is no exception, following similar trends as it's predecessors: first and second season good, third a little worse, fourth terrible and the rest trying to redeem themselves. There is real issues with this show, some story lines are predictable and it is not short of problematic choices that the series made. Like the super suit (it changed but still). I can understand how there are some decisions that were made that were questionable especially to a show which was the first female lead CW DC show. But I still love the show, when you don't read to much into it, it is enjoyable and is able to be both comedically entertaining and suspenseful. Each DC CW show has there merits and Supergirl has quite a few. Also the casting of Kara and her interaction with other members of the arrowverse is showing a chemistry and quirkiness which the arrowverse was desperate of. I even enjoyed the weird singing flash and Supergirl crossover which is interesting because of my regular dislike of musical episodes. Overall, Supergirl is a great entry and should get more credit for what it brings to the DC CW table, but it's not for everyone.",

            "content": "Tuesday nights are \"Flash Night\". We don't miss The Flash. Period.When Supergirl came out, Monday's became \"Supergirl Night\". That's what my kids call it. Monday is no longer Monday, it is \"Supergirl Night\".The show is, in many respects, cringe-inducing cheese. Melodramatic overacting is almost a stylistic hallmark of this show. And I'm OK with that.Here's why: Supergirl is a show I can watch with my young kids in which my daughters can see a superhero who struggles with her own awkwardness and insecurity and who does not adopt the hyper- sexualized path that is so common is comic depictions of women. Kara is charming. I'd never heard of Melissa Benoist prior to this show, and wasn't initially convinced (based on the pre-show promotional material). But she has won me over as the PERFECT Kara Danvers (Kara Zor-El).Even the character of Cat Grant, though tough as nails and very full of herself, offers glimpses of an admirably strong female character. She's deeply flawed, but I think she knows it. LOVE, LOVE, LOVE Calista Flockhart in this role. It feels tailor-made for her.My one complaint is that CBS hasn't seemed to catch on yet that their audience consists of families and young girls. Almost every bit of Supergirl related merchandise is in the form of adult shirts or toys based off of scantily dressed, big-boobed versions of Supergirl. Not appropriate for girls under age 10, in my opinion.There's a tremendous charm in this show, if you accept the cheese- factor as a stylistic choice. It's lighthearted, funny, and sweet.I truly hope CBS decides to renew for season 2. If not, send it to CW where it can thrive alongside Arrow, Flash, and the forgettable LoT.",

It was cheesy in presentation and dialog much of the time. Even my teenagers were unwilling to give it a fair go. However, I had already bought it on DVD, so I continued to watch it anyway. I waded through some pretty frequent bad acting and constant lack of creativity for a story line that was almost completely superman's in weaker female form. (Not being weaker because it's a female.) To my surprise, somewhere amidst my wading, I discovered that there was heart and beauty hidden within its many flaws. There have been many times in this 1st season that have really gotten to me. If the writers will find a way to bring more of this heart captivating beauty into a foundation for the show and if the actors can become grounded in it, then it could truly transform into quite a work of art. I wish them all the best & hope deeply that the cross over with Smallville that I've heard talk of is magnificent and won't disappoint. (Smallville was my fav!)",

And this was only increasing less and less action and more and more emotional relations dramas, and more emotional dramas and some more. Their personal dealings had less and less energy and fun and more and more heaviness some more heaviness. So, I made habit whenever they started with their foolish dramas I just clicked forward until end of scene, that left me with less than 20 minutes that was actually interesting, fun, unpredictable and interesting. I started to watch Supergirl because I like superhero movies but this showactually turned into some heavy relationship drama, it might be suitable for females who like dramas and for girly teens, yup.",

Perhaps, the actions from the flash affected this show as well because it definitely need a re-do. The four shows crossing over that might be awesome and just what this show need.

Lets start with Kara....well she's no Felicity Smoak (who if you look up A-dork-able in the dictionary there is a picture of Felicity) but she does a pretty plausible job of being clumsy, awkward, put upon nerd by day and super heroine by night (or day, depending on the nature of the disaster!). It has to be considered a cute and cuddly superhero series, kid friendly to a large degree (If flash is Doctor Who and Arrow is Torchwood, then Supergirl is definitely Sarah Jane Adventures), it's likable and fun! While I totally disagree with Jimmy....sorry James Olson being a buff black dude instead of a nerdy kid, the character dynamic between Kara, James and Winn works really well. The whole secret government agency thing with Hank \"I'm not really Hank\" Henshaw and Kara's older (and far hotter) adoptive sister Alex, gives that nice support team feel that I'm sure we've gotten used to with superhero series. Whilst I was initially hoping that CBS and The CW could work out their differences so Kara could go to Star City or Central City (or visa versa) to flesh out her universe, I now don't think there's any need, it would still be cool but not the life preserver that I thought this series needed after the first 3 episodes. Try episodes 4 onwards, if you still can't get on with it then it's obviously not for you.",

            "content": "\"Supergirl\" is a 'new' take on DC Comics' character and explores what it's like being a female super hero in a world where everyone already looks at the man of steel as their sole protector. Unlike Superman's solitary role, Supergirl is someone intricately tied to her friends and family, great part of her strength coming from values such as friendship and kindness -- something which today, on television, is rarely seen in such a raw, campy manner. With every episode, the show carries positive messages, feminist reinforcement for the many women who admire and take inspiration from a character like Supergirl. It carries that 1990's spirit that characterised popular TV series like Xena or Buffy: women are just as capable of getting things done, and have no need to fight other women for it.Some level of criticism can be applied to how some episodes roll out, the general plot itself, or sometimes the overacting/stiffness of a character here and there but these are minimal things that shouldn't detract from enjoying the show itself because this is being developed on a different scope from other super hero shows, and it's fairly ridiculous to try and compare them when the differences are pretty clear.Which brings to my final point that it's disingenuous that negative reviews that employ such language as \"political correctness\" or \"feminist propaganda\" continue to be featured as the hallmark of opinion on the show, not the expected commentary for a primary male demographic that has a hard time accepting that TV series can also be made with the aim of appealing to female demographics and providing them a source of not only entertainment but confidence and feminist empowerment.",

Relationships are USELESS, badly written, with no impact on the characters just to please some social / minority agenda (Mon-El is antipathic, Maggie serves no purpose, but for a LGBTXYZ quota on the show). Dialogues are badly written, nearly all males depicted act as if they are castrated. Just because the audience also includes kids, does not mean that actors should talk like retarded teletubbies, just look at Joss Whedon's Buffy and Angel. Supergirl seems to think that people keep attacking her because of her lady parts. Superpowers are rarely / badly used (WTF!): Supergirl getting her butt kicked by humans with some gadget\u0085 where is the superspeed, where are the superreflexes? Writers do not seem to have read any Superhero comics, and do not understand their appeal. Every time Clark Kent / Superman is mentioned, he is put into a bad light (?!!) However, if you forget the subtext that \"Women are better than men\", then they won't forget reminding you at every turn. Actors are good, completely out of sync with the real comics, writers suck as Black Holes suck matter. I was already watching the last 10 or so episodes with the mouse more pressed on fast forward than on play. Everything mentioned here is the tip of the iceberg, I won't even talk about the rest. Mellissa Benoist being really cute is not enough a reason to keep watching the show. Were there good episodes? There were some really GREAT ones, especially the crossovers with Flash and the Arrowverse, and these are the only ones I will keep watching.Could they get any worse?

There is plenty to satisfy the non-geeky like my wife and the rest of us with episodes like \"For the Girl Who Has Everything.\"On an entertainment level I would probably rate the DC/Marvel TV shows something like:1.

            "content": "I had high hopes when I heard there was a super girl series and I have yet to be impressed. From the lackluster fight scenes to the weak character portrayals. This is nothing like a super girl story. It feels like lazy script writing with which involves creating a superman storyline and replacing superman with super girl with Maxwell lord who becomes our knock off lex Luthor.There's nothing wrong with re-imagining an iconic character and story. But ultimately the new story should add to the overall mythology or at the very least pay tribute or complement it. e.g heath ledgers joker persona was amazing and instantly iconic because we could see the joker we loved but we were also introduced to this new shade of madness. In the case of this series it's a poor imagining and a terrible tribute to one of the most complex and iconic characters that dc has produced.The main conflict of the series is vaguely defined is it the kryptonians or Maxwell lord. Why has astra been given jor el's role as doomsayers of krypton? Why are the prisoners of fort raz hiding from the d.e.o. considering that the vast majority are kryptonians... and shouldn't the d.e.o have better weapons than just bullets and kryptonite. How are they even capable of catching even one of theses escapees considering how these escapees end up killing them like red shirts.At the very least from a supergirl series I expected not to be treated to a rehashing of Superman's mediocre hits from dealing with general lane. Getting Jimmy Olsen as your morality compass/bestie. Being responsible for a couple of Superman's rogues gallery such as Livermore and blizzard etc. (various complaints onwards etc). Every episode seems like a new way to fail or disappoint What most people expected was to see a SUPER GIRL story.and this is not it.",

            "content": "When Supergirl first started, the underlying (or more aptly, overlying) message was particularly shoved in the face of the viewers. As I think most people noticed, the message was prone to more extreme views on men and women. However, I do believe that the show, in its progression over the past three seasons, has gotten much better at incorporating both strong men and women into the story and showing them coexist and getting along. In addition, more of the villains have been women in the recent season, which provides a nice balance to the \"women are morally better than men\" tone from the first season and casts a refreshing light on the moral situation in the real world: that both men and women are aptly prone to evil, albeit not always the same evil, as well as good.Moving on from the men and women ideological stances throughout the show's progression, I still think the stances taken in some sequences are particuarly unfit for Supergirl's message in a more fundamental sense. Supergirl, at her core, is the feminine embodiment of the ideals that her and Superman share. Superman himself was based on the core ideals of a religious and non-religious cumulation of hero myths, essentially communicating ways in which to properly function in the world (treat others with respect, don't kill other humans, etc). A toolbox to make another toolbox, the second of which you work through what you experience in the world. Essentially, Supergirl presents you with the first toolbox, but then provides you with certain tools for the subsequent toolbox, shaping how you finish constructing that second toolbox. For the ideologies that Supergirl is based off, I think it's a bit of a reach for the show to take that extra step. However, with previous progression of the show, I think (and hope) that it nears ridding itself of this habit.In contrast, one of the show's strengths is the emotional aspect to the characters. Character motivations have been fleshed out more thoroughly and drive the story to a much greater degree than before (in the right direction, I might add). I saw glimpses of this in season one, but these instances became more common in following seasons. Characters seem consistent and solid, with characters being impacted by certain events for more than an episode or two (a pathology that has plagued particularly characters of The Flash) and their decisions, for the most part, aren't driven by idiotic storylines meant to generate unnecessary and illogical tension (the pathology that has plagued Arrow, particularly between the two \"teams\").In my opinion, at the end of season three, Supergirl ranks 2nd in my list of DC TV shows, behind Legends. Supergirl has me feel for the characters and most decisions feel in line with the character development. Flash and Arrow have been plagued, mostly, by the story constantly molding the characters into what it needs them to be, instead of the other way around.If you're looking for an ideological superhero trope, watch Smallville. It's storytelling and moral teachings are more in line with what the characters are at their core. While Supergirl is doing well in connecting viewers to its characters, it still falls short in terms of accurately communicating, what I would term, the main character's core ideologies. I can only hope that it continues to learn from its mistakes, which apparently Flash and Arrow have struggled to accomplish.",

Also a lot of crossovers are there to come soon as DC is bringing multi-verse to the TV and thus I am hoping for it to become more fun very soon. From acting point of view, everybody seems to be doing a brilliant role. Melissa Benoist has shown great potential as Kara and as Supergirl.

And in a sense, I do agree with them a bit.But you have to remember this isn't a show that is trying to recreate the comics. It isn't one that is trying to appeal to only the action lovers. If you can see it without the bias of the comics it isn't actually all that bad.I'll be honest. Supergirl needs some definite improvement. The show goes way too deep into the emotional stuff sometimes, and often goes way outside the main plot, but if you can overlook all the cheesy moments, you'll definitely see it in a new way.So to wrap up - don't be biased, think of it as a new show, as an untold story, and remember that it will get better as time passes.",

As if comic books themselves aren't tropey and at times, silly. In the same breath it's accused of being too radical. A black Jimmy Olsen? How dare they? Supergirl's hair isn't blonde enough? The scandal! Here's the thing about this show. It's far from perfect. The pilot, at times, felt like a kid high off candy - too excitable to be charming. The first few episodes stumbled through a plot. Writing has been somewhat inconsistent, and yes, characters have been changed from their traditional comic-book origins. But the show has been consistent with one thing - it captures the essence of Supergirl. This isn't Arrow or Gotham, where Man!Pain fuels the story along. It isn't supposed to be. This is the story about a young woman coming into her own. Of course it's going to have a strong feminist angle. After years of listening to whiny male superheroes, I'm delighted that we finally have a hero, dealing with balancing what it means to be a woman with what it means to be a superhero. This is designed to be a show that parents can watch with their kids. That doesn't make it infantile or immature, but it does mean that it's going to be lighter than say Arrow. This isn't a bad thing.The show has been consistently getting better. It does a fantastic job of showing off the Superman mythos, while keeping it about Kara, reminding us that this is her story. It has a great cast of women.Melissa Benoist absolutely captures Kara's dorky persona, as well as the strength of Supergirl. She's a revelation, after watching so many heroes brood on our screens. Calista Flockhart is not just the bitchy boss; she's shown to care deeply about National City and Supergirl herself. She plays the role with so many nuances, it's fascinating to watch. Chyler Leigh, who plays Kara's sister, Alex is equally engaging, and it's refreshing seeing a cast of female characters who aren't sniping or plotting against each other. This show might have taken a while to find its feet, but it's getting there, and the ride has been an enjoyable one. This show has become charming and sweet, and quirky and everything I would have expected from Supergirl. It focuses on hope and friendship and family and why should these values be ridiculed just because they're championed by a girl?",

I think the only thing I would change is the Jimmy Olsen actor. He did a good job playing a pro football player, but does not fit the Jimmy Olsen character at all. But its not like he takes much away from the show. They do a good job with every episode, and it is fun to watch. I like the fact that they stick to the comic book where they can, but also can make good choices on things they add in to the story. The storyline of her pulling a prison ship with her accidentally when her ship landed filled 2 purposes. First it explained her delay in arriving to Earth, stuck in space for 24 years. Second it provides villains that are capable of defeating her. That way a villain does not have to find kryptonite, or they are out of luck. I also like that they can't explain why her ship broke free after so much time, not every mystery needs solved. I was glad it got picked up for a full season, and hope it has a run of several good seasons.",

People are entitled to their opinion, but when someone says an event that has been hinted at since the very first episode of the series and basically spelled out for you by the 4th episode came out of nowhere, you have no choice, but to question the validity of their opinion. In this show most of the major plot points are developed to the point where you watch the show just to see when they play it out for you. As I referenced above with Alex being gay. Cat, Lena, and Snapper knowing Kara is Supergirl is another major one. The footage of a young Kara saving someone in a car plays a part near the end of season 2. Mon-El Jeremiah and Martian Man Hunter all get the same treatment as well. For the most part the payoff is usually worth sitting through the build up.Political views play a role on this show as well, more so in the second season then the first. You'll notice on this site and others that reviewers prefer one season over another the first half of season 2 over the second half depending on their political views.A few people complained about how Jimmy was changed to a black guy, a change that literally had no effect but to make a 10 minute Interracial relationship and gave the character to be a mentor type character to a child. Either way the character was relatable even to a Spanish guy.The only truly feminist character on this show is Cat Grant. She is the one that beyond being a strong female tries to help women improve themselves. She took Kara, Livewire, and Silver Banshee under her wing, only one was able to see that she wasn't a bitch, she just played one for her own reasons. She is a great role model for young women, but horrible for children. Wanting gender equality (or getting as close as possible) doesn't make you a feminist anymore than being a manhater with hairy armpits that burns bras does. The former is a decent human being, the latter is a selfish idiot who would be a misogynistic man if she were born male. Being altruistic (Kara) doesn't make you feminist, it makes you a good person. A show about a girl being girly is nothing new, romance and asinine dialogue between women is expected. Though I do hold a big grudge for the OTP comment. Damn millennials and their random BS. How do you have a one true pairing, when you aren't even in the pairing! It makes her dumb for being sad about Mon-El. I maintain that the comment should have been about a health condition. Then when Lena reveals she knew Kara was Supergirl she could bring it up. As an added bonus, 10 seconds of my life wouldn't have been wasted looking that up.All signs Alex was gay -Winn accuses Supergirl of being Gay -Alex is hostile towards all men before big reveal -fake date with a guy doesn't make her straight -In the fourth episode Kara tells Alex to tell Eliza her secret and she acted like Kara knew something she shouldn't before Kara says she means the DEO. -Cat says she has evidence someone in the city is gay.",

Vibe?). The show evolved dimensions and when they added more and more characters from the DC mainstream like a certain very famous alien- it's now on par with the flash. As of episode 13- this show is going great. Hope it gets even better and CBS picks it for another 4-5 seasons at least cause this show has potential.Sure Jimmy was like a thorn in the show but how they've integrated him now is worth watching. And it has a much better season so far as compared to Marvel's Agents of shield season 1. Give it a shot. And haters- please do not use feminism and casting as a way to show your disinterest. Of course a show with a female superhero will have to deal with real world female problems. You can't expect Ms. Benoist to start acting like Stephen Amell in Arrow. It's a family show that delivers what it sets out to do. Seriously- I can't wait for the crossover on 28th March 2016. Hope they have more of that.",

There is no need for a new show. Also, the reason that Smallville is\nbetter is because there was a mature adult storyline. Supergirl has adults acting like teenagers. This show is stuck in teen land. Sure, there \nwas a lot of romance in Smallville but it was interesting and handled \nin a way where if they were adults and they liked each other, they would handle it like ADULTS. This show didn't respect Smallville as well, and they have the nerve to mention a Smallville original character? (Chloe Sullivan).\nKara in Smallville was a bad ass fighter as well as character. Kara in Supergirl, acts like she is scared of her own powers or something. In Smallville if somebody was shooting a gun, Clark (Superman) would save them. Apparently in an episode of Supergirl, Kara just stood there instead of trying to turn off a switch which was hazardous. What the hell Supergirl? Also, how many times have you seen her cry in stupid situations? For example, in Season 2 when she cuddles with Mon-El because she is upset. Would Kara from Smallville do this? I don't think so. She doesn't have time for that because she is Supergirl. It's the same with Clark too. He doesn't have enough time for his love interest because he is Superman and he has to save the world. It makes sense. It's realistic. I mean Kara in Smallville would cry at the right time and for the right reasons. She was a tough cookie who didn't give a crap unlike in Supergirl where she acts like a teenage drama queen instead of an adult. If you love Superhero shows, DON'T watch this one. To me, Smallville is the best Teen Superhero show. It doesn't matter if it came out in the 2000s, it will always be better for what it was as a Teen show. It had lots of action, cool fight scenes, gory scenes, an interesting adult storyline as well as an amazing story as a whole show. Supergirl, what do you have?",

Xena, at times was dark, but never so much so, that you could never feel good while you were watching it. Remember Lex Luthor as portrayed by Gene Hackman, now that's a villain. You hated him, but the tone was not so dark as to be depressing. Secondly, having 4 daughters and 3 granddaughters, anything that portrays, strong women, is fine my me. In fact of the 3 main females, perhaps Cat Grant and Alex, may be the strongest, and help Kara/Supergirl, to grow, as she undertakes this journey. My problems with the show. Love triangles, please stop. Next, Jimmy Olsen should have been played by Jeremy Jordan, and Winn Schott by Mehcad Brooks. Whet happened to Jimmy being a nerd? Also please stop preaching to us. Kryptonians worrying about us destroying our planet, enough already. Hopefully the writing will improve, and the story lines will not be as lame. As to the acting, which many of you hate.

            "content": "Yes, I get it: If you're an American conservative, you're going to hate this show. And if you aren't open to changing your mind about anything, you shouldn't even watch it.And, although the agenda being pushed unsubtly by the show is definitely on the liberal end of the American political spectrum, most of it would be considered mainstream in the rest of the free world. Feminism, normalization of homosexual relations, climate change, gun control, immigration, and even some sly digs at Donald Trump, are all there. But note that several of the bad guys are actually extremist environmentalists.I suspect that much of the criticism of other aspects of the show: the dialogue, the acting, the plots, even the fight scenes, is caused by the reverse-halo effect, whereby, something one finds undesirable causes one to see only flaws everywhere else.Personally, I found the dialog, especially the banter between the characters, believable, but not to the point of being too obvious or stereotyped. However, I concede that in the more serious intimate scenes, there did seem to be rather too much of \"I believe in you\", \"You need to believe in yourself\", etc., and also an unrealistic emphasis on characters lives being totally dedicated to the \"protection\" of other ones. Why anyone would \"protect\" another character by recruiting them into one of the most dangerous jobs on the planet is beyond me! As is why characters invulnerable to practically anything except Kryptonite would need especial protection. I found the acting to be good; in fact, I didn't even notice the acting most of the time: generally a good sign. The only character who didn't work for me was Superman: maybe the acting, maybe the casting, maybe just his appearance, didn't work for me.It was interesting to see some \"bad guys\" with noble agendas, not just out for world domination or revenge. This led to some genuine debate between the characters.Melissa Benoist is cute, funny, likable, and surprisingly vulnerable emotionally, and anchors the show very watchably.The frequent cases where ties of family and friendship led to violations of national security, apparently without penalty, were particularly unrealistic; but the whole show demands considerable suspension of disbelief anyway.Some have criticized the misandry (man-hatred) of the show. I think this is hard to support: there are several very strong, highly admirable, male characters. Also, there are far more cruel, ruthless female characters than male ones. As a father, myself, I do sometimes find the portrayal on TV of fathers, to be outrageous. This seems to happen mainly in animated shows for children: examples include 'Fairly Oddparents', 'The Amazing World of Gumball', and 'Johnny Test'. At the worst, the Dad is lazy, feckless, and severely morally compromised, while the Mom is the opposite. 'The Simpsons' is like this too, but the intelligence and wit of the show just-about make up for this. However, I felt no such outrage at the portrayal of men in 'Supergirl'.Some have said that every character is judged by how they relate to Supergirl. In fact, she is not shown as perfect: in one scene, when her own moral compass is compromised, it takes a male character to show her what she should do. There are other scenes where a steadying male character has to overrule an over-emotional and out-of-control female one.Some have criticized differences from the original comic books. At the age of 9, I was an avid reader of DC's 'Superman', 'Action', and 'Adventure' comics, spending all my meager weekly allowance on them. I was not so much a follower of Supergirl, but I'm very familiar with the Jimmy Olsen figure. But, you know what? This is a reboot: it's dragging the characters over 50 years forward in time: there was no internet, blogging, or cell phones, in those days. Just don't think of 21st Century James Olsen as the same as 20th Century Jimmy Olsen. Also, the many references to real-life people, although repeated to the point of self-parody, serve to anchor the show firmly in the 20-teens.I was surprised at the number of vulnerabilities the Girl of Steel supposedly has: ones that I don't remember from the comics; but in a series this long, if she can't be hurt by anything other than Kryptonite, then in order to maintain the dramatic tension without being tiresomely repetitive, there have to be several ways to hurt or limit her.There's a huge amount of hand-to-hand combat, with the frequent clich\u00e9 of a character being slammed into something massive and destroying it.I will say that the rapid sequence of love-interests was rather unrealistic, and frustrating; and the reason given for cutting some of them off bizarre: \"The Universe seems to be telling us something\".I didn't like the way some episodes ended with \"to be continued on 'The Flash'\", as Netflix didn't provide that continuity. This may explain why a serious rift between two characters was entirely mended by the start of the next one.I started overhearing the show as my 12-year-old binge-watched it, then I watched some of the later episodes with him. After that, I was hooked, and at the time of writing, I've seen almost all of them.Added 7/5/2017: It seems three people found this review unhelpful: Since I advised conservatives not to watch the show, I guess they must be conservatives who liked the show, after all.",

After seeing some of the reviews on here about this series, SERIOUS consideration needs to be taken into account that MARVEL does NOT completely follow their own story lines either, citing that Tony Stark did not create Ultron like in the movie, as Hank Pym did in the comics for example... So to discredit this show on the basis of it not following the comic is ridicoulous. The show is what you make of it. In general, it is all set for the imagination. Helen Slater's Supergirl, came from Argo City, as Benoist came from Krypton to protect Superman. Does it really matter how the \"Mythology\" is told, or how the story develops? Supergirl, whether 1984, or time now, was a little quirky and naive, yet strong-willed and opinionated in her character and that is still instilled in the same character be it Slater or Benoist. The show itself started a little clunky at first, and I will admit with Hank, I had no clue who he was with the red eyes. But that was what captivated me. If someone didn't know by now, I was really surprised and actually did research on the Martian Manhunter when I found out about J'onn Jones. It took me back to watching Super Friends cartoons when I was a kid with him.Maybe Supergirl wasn't a one hero show, but by adding another element into it like J'onn they definitely added interest, and added elements for a deeper well-defined story. For a first season, it definitely deserves 2 more seasons to develop and see how it continues. Possibly do Flash, and Arrow cameos every now and again.Supergirl is still Supergirl, with an update from 1984. And Melissa Benoist does the part justice.

Yes, women are in a position of power in this show, but so what? It's not preachy, it never once mentions \"girl power\" or anything of the sort, and even goes out of its way to remind you that Superman is a hero in this universe MORE powerful than Supergirl. Anyone crying on here about SJW's is clearly a little man with self-esteem issues.That said, the first 7-8 episodes of the first season are weak, but it's mainly due to the same issues that plague any show. It takes a bit to find its voice, but once it gets rolling it's a solid villain of the week show with an under-current of season-long plot (a la The Flash or The Arrow). Kara Zor-El is lovable, Martian Manhunter is spectacularly realized (if a bit weaker than he should be), and the ensemble surrounding them is solid.Some suspension of disbelief is required (with several super-powered aliens, some of them Kryptonian, threatening to destroy the world, why doesn't Supergirl ask for Clark's help ever?), but it's never enough to distract from the fun. Now that the show is on the CW, I'm hopeful it'll find the same rhythm as the other Berlantiland shows, but season 1 is still solid and fun.Again, if you like super heroes, you'll enjoy this show. It baffles me how DC's television division can be crushing it this much while their movie universe is a straight abortion.",

Its like this series was created fast thinking that it would be a hit just because all the other hero series where very good so they thought this one would get the same reaction. I believe this one is very corny honestly. I think Jessica Jones is much better and more fun to watch. I personally can not wait for the season. With that said I would choose Jessica Jones over super girl any day. So if you have not seen Jessica Jones yet I think you should when ever you have the time, but this is my opinion.I want to hear what others will say about my review on which one is better and who is the better superhero right now!",

There really isn't much to say other then this was one of the top failures of the show.To end, I have had fun watching it before the forth season.

After watching the pilot episode (yes, I feel guilty, but good guilty)I have to say that this is what a comic book TV series should be, full of fun, action, and heart. Supergirl has all three in and its it out of the ball park on all three as well. There are very few times that I think a series has hit the bullseye when it comes to the cast, but this is one of those times. Melissa Benoist is Supergirl, no one else could portray this iconic character any better. She is the girl next door that just so happens can lift a plane, stop a bullet and smile with a smile that could brighten anyone's day. Melissa does all of this with ease. The supporting cast hits all the right notes as well. The positives: Action, action and more action. Sister chemistry that hits all the right notes. Melissa moves from Kara Danvers to Supergirl persona with ease, fun to watch. Casting is perfect. Lots of heart and soul.The negatives: The pilot really could have been a 2 hour pilot, some of it seemed rushed to me.Will definitely be watching in the fall.Many seem to think that it hits a feminist vibe too hard. Well, if showing a strong female on TV and doing it well, well....then I guess this series does that. In my opinion, it's about time.",

Hopefully that gives them enough time to gradually dye her hair more blonde to fit the character.And I have no idea why the director had Chyler Leigh cut her hair short for the role. Pretty sure this is also an inaccurate depiction of the character. I get that the director wants to put his own spin on things, but do that in the actual story line (which by the way, obviously needs more attention paid to) and not the character details. Swaying away from original character designs does nothing for the comic fans.Honestly, I just googled Alex Danvers dc comics and the first pictures from Pinterest of all places had better character designs.Also, after seeing the success for Arrow and Flash, the cg animations were pretty disappointing for this show.",

He does not have the physique!!! 3) The change to Jimmy Olsen! Should be a slightly nerdy white guy! Not some athletic looking black guy. The guy who plays Winn would have been a better Jimmy!

Mix that with a female dominated cast and corny dialogue and you get a chick flick for 13 years old girls. Luckily, someone in the production recognized this problem in time and successfully pointed in the right direction.From that point on the show continued in decent manner.

Now, at the end of the season 5, every character is just too stupid and weak, even Supergirl, they all are just clapping at Lex Lexor, at one of the most irritatimg character ever. I just don't understand why they brought him back on the show. Now they overpowered him and this is note easy to watch.",

            "content": "There is so much to love about this show. I applaud the amount of diversity it contains. Black lead, female title role, Gay lead character and an ethically and age spanning supporting cast. Far from just lazily labelling these as politically correct, it is most definitely needed and welcomed in my book. \nThere are a lot of strong actors in the show, no less than Melissa Benoist who plays both parts brilliantly, and yes, I'm going to say it, she is absolutely gorgeous. It's hard to find a weakness acting wise. \nHowever... The writing is just awful. \nSo we thought superman was the last Kryptonian until Supergirl came along? That's it now right? Wrong! Apparently there's plenty of them around. And of course they're all bad eggs. \nI struggle with this whole idea of all these aliens roaming the earth. A new one suddenly and conveniently coming out of the shadows with different powers to help develop a new storyline. \nSpeaking of storylines, there is just far too much going on. Just when you think you're getting your head around a new character or storyline, something else crops up. \nThe use of some of the characters is also bad. \nAn IT guy at CatCo suddenly being a major computer hacker at the DEO, after just being allowed to walk in to this secret government organisation by the way. Jimmy, sorry, James Olsen is now a muscly, suave, cool guy who all the ladies swoon over. Oh yeah, and he runs CatCo, a multi million dollar organisation after Cat Grant leaves. It seems photography can get you into top jobs, no experience necessary.\nI still watch it with the hope that all this potential will turn into a great show, but I'm still waiting.",

The scenery leaves a bit to be desired, but great productions like \"G.o.t.\" can contribute to a great cinematic expectation, it is necessary to understand the difference.",

            "review_title": "Action and drama in good balance, don't expect it to be like the superhero movies",
            "content": "The first season of supergirl was all about her finding out what it means to be supergirl. It is entertaining with action and light on drama. With Astra her aunt and astras troups as the main villain, Kara is reminded to her time on Krypton but also find herself beeing decieved by her parents.\nIn the second season she has to endure and move forward in her personal life als well as her carrier at Catco takes a big steps forward. As a result of that there is some more drama. With Lena beeing introduced as Karas friend and Lenas mom as a strong villain, the show creates the typical Luther-Super/Kryptonien drama we know from Smallville. \nPersonally I think the first season is lighter and more fun than the second. The second season is a bit darker and with more and deeper drama.\nThe third season started of with Kara be very cold alfter the loss of Mon-El. She realises that she will never be human, so she tries to shut down and burries her human parts,but son she finds her way back to an hopfull an lighter character. The worldkillers as the main villain are very dark, but at the same time seam to be a victim to who they are. That creates the possility of an uncertain outcome. Overall I think that the third season is the best so far. The fokus on Karas relationships in this season change up the dramatic parts. I like how most of the charakters show both thier lightfull and dark sides.\nFor an show that has a female superhero I would like to see some more women power also form Kara friends. \nI don't like that they introdused so many other hero charakter witch prevents Kara from standing out. I think there should be only a few episodes with them and than they leave again, like the flash crossovers.\nI can't say anything on how true the show is to the comics, but I in my oppinion that doesn't matter since the show stands as an storry by itself.Averall I think it is an greate show that has over the seasons improved its perfomance but also changed up its style.",

I can't wait until season 3's crossover begins. Maybe session 3 will tell us what happened to Lillian Luthor. Lillian Luthor helped save the world and then she disappeared.

I love the characters, the story which means I love the writers, the directors, the actors and everyone involved with the TV show. The series is light, has comedy, drama and deals with contemporary issues. The two seasons are great and I honestly can not pick one or a favorite episode. The plots are great and the series deserves the third season, which will come in 2018. People can speak whatever they want because nothing changes the feeling of true fans of the series. So, I finish saying that who loves #Supergirl will continue to love and who does not love can happen to love a day or not. But that would be a waste, would lose the grace that the world has thanks to #Supergirl.",

            "content": "After finishing the watching of Season 1, Super girl(2015), I am eager to say that this series is the one that I have dreamed for a long time. 1. It shows modern office life:With the office stories, I gradually got better understanding on dealing with different colleagues and daily work.-Everybody has their own advantages and disadvantages. The point is how you figure it out and make use of them. -Not everyone can be united, but it's enough to unite those you can. -Nobody can become outstanding without sufficient efforts and trifle repeating. 2. Full of positive energy:Sometimes or more often, we missed from our correct path. It's simply because of some fear inside. However, who knows there are a real fear behind the fear? We should dig it out and face it with hope.Shining yourself probably make your life easier. The good things may have come around you before you notice it.To be honest, I can't understand why many American movies, especially science fiction, likely show something ugly, disgusting, bloody and scary. Film arts are kinds of art and they can completely be made positive, lovely and gorgeous. This series doesn't show those too much. But some aliens are designed ugly, even disgusting. So this is the unique pity from my own perspective. 3. The heroine is a pretty and young lady:Kara isn't that pretty, but it is a good compromise among film art, an alien being able to fit in humans and my unreasonable expectation. Kara is such a gentle and kind girl. So you can feel her beauty from interior. However, nobody is perfect in reality and not even Supergirl. A good person may be lost sometimes, understanding becomes critical at the moment. It's perfect for Supergirl to fit-in humans if there is no the scar in front of Kara's eyebrow. However, could it be easy to find such a good actress without any scar on face?Of course, there are many more good points. But I feel that these 3 are what make the series distinctive and impressive. I am from China and English isn't my first language. So it's highly appreciated if some friends with native English could optimize my expression. I have too much to say, but don't know how to express correctly. My English name is Gifford and overall I love this series. I would rank it with all 10 stars.",

Examples, Margot Kidder (1980's Lois Lane) or the original Supergirl Helen Slater and ANY of the cast members from these films. As witty as her boss is and as many 'inside jokes' that they write into the script these celebrity cameos are very much appropriate. I LOVE that Netflix has this as an Instant Watch as that's the only way I can watch TV anymore with all the commercials. I hope this show goes on for years and years including epic episodes with legendary cameo's! Great Job!",

I'm all for equal rights among gender and races, but come on! Supergirl beats Superman in a fight? He's twice her size! So why not have the top current UFC female fighter take on Conor McGregor, right? Why isn't that happening...lol! Do they really think viewers are going to think, \"Yeah, that would happen if Superman and Supergirl were real.\" And hardly a white male heterosexual (oh no, I said three bad words in a row lol) in sight anywhere in the show, and if there is one, like Winn, they are portrayed as goofy, insignificant, wimpy flunkies...even Superman clearly bows down to Queen Kara like some lowly subject. And If a white male isn't a wimp, he's an evil character, of course, since ALL white male adults are despicable, male chauvinist pigs, right? lol\nIf the producers could get away with making Flash an African-American gay female, they would...lol! Again, not a racist or chauvinist here, but the liberal slants on these shows is just over-the-top...they should tone that down a bit to make it more realistic (as realistic as a superhero show could be, anyway). Take the Marvel TV shows like Daredevil, Luke Cage, etc. Great shows, and in those you don't have this liberal stuff being shoved down your throat every five minutes! Those shows are far more normal in that respect, and so yes, they are better shows overall!",
