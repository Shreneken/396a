            "content": "There are about four films that can overcome the \"seen it\" cynicism I have, unlock my heart and make me feel genuine feelings. In other films I can appreciate that the film is beautiful and emotional, but there are only four that can really get to me. The first was Crash, the second was The Green Mile and the third was Boyhood. Me and Earl and the Dying Girl just scored the fourth slot on that extremely small list. Alfonso Gomez-Rejon's film is a beautiful cocktail of wonderful things. Its quirky and charming and witty and touching and somber and delicate and completely beautiful. Its got elements of about six of my favourite films of all time, and the fact that it slam dunked Sundance doesn't even surprise me a bit. Thomas Mann's Greg is a weirdo. Imagine that Napoleon Dynamite went to Cady Heron's school from Mean Girls, hated all the clicks and became a cynic. Mann shades what could've been a completely unlikeable protagonist with wonderful colours and depth, so much so that when his friend Earl explains to Rachel why Greg is so averse to being friends, we realise we've actually known the whole time. That's probably the most beautiful part of Gomez- Rejon's direction - he never comes out and beats you with information, he leads you gently to it and makes you realise it yourself. RJ Cyler takes Earl, a generic Pedro-type sidekick and makes him just the slacker you'd expect, but with incredible qualities underneath. Olivia Cooke makes the audience love her with her quietly devastating portrayal of a girl with leukaemia. All I can say is that she is a worth recipient of my annual Patricia Arquette Award For Character I Most Want to Hug.Considering this film has maybe one actor I'd ever heard of, there's a huge pool of talent even in the supporting cast. John Bernthal is good in everything. Nick Offerman is amazing as Greg's stay at home intellectual dad, and Molly Shannon steals every scene as Rachel's emotionally destroyed mother. Keep an eye out for Matt Bennett's utterly bizarre but hilarious Scott Mayhew as well.Jesse Andrews' screenplay strikes an incredible balance between comedy and drama. Its very easy for a film about cancerous teens to become completely depressing and tedious, but the witty dialogue, incredible spikes of humour and quirky characters make the film beautiful. Andrews isn't trying to make a statement, he's just telling a story about a normal boy who strikes up a friendship with a normal girl. The dialogue is as real as any movie I've ever seen, and the use of minimal effects and hand-held camera really created an authenticity that made me walk away feeling like I've just watched a highly personal reflection, and not a work of fiction.",

            "content": "I have to start my review with discussing the inevitable comparisons with \"The Fault in Our Stars\". John Green fans would find it blasphemous to say this is a superior film but it certainly is. I don't think that I can argue that the characters in TFIOS are more realistic, but the whole unique style and quirkiness of MAEATDG make it a true classic of the teen genre like \"The Breakfast Club\" or \"Breaking Away\". It as important as many of the films to which Earl and Greg pay homage with their own hilarious versions.So many of the same subjects that one finds in any film about the coming of age of high school students exist in this film, but the director Alfonso Gomez-Rejon puts his own stamp on what could otherwise be called clich\u00e9. Kudos to Gomez-Rejon whose previous work has been with several Fox TV shows. He should have a good career in film from here on out.Olivia Cooke as Rachel, Thomas Mann as Greg, and RJ Cyler as Earl are all fantastic. I was familiar with Olivia Cooke before but not the other two. I expect to see a lot more from all of them.The adults are all superbly cast as well. Molly Shannon spends the movie with a glass of white wine in one hand drowning the pain of dealing with her daughter's plight. Connie Briton and Nick Offerman are wonderful as Greg's parents, with Nick showing that the eccentricities of the child do not fall far from the tree.I saw this tonight at a screening in Denver at an art house cinema called \"The Mayan\" It was built probably in the 30s or 40s most likely a single cinema that they did a pop top on to create two more theaters. Those two upstairs theaters are odd to say the least. The leg room is less than economy class on Spirit Air and the screen is not much more than double the size of my screen at home. Probably less that 150 seats as well.Weird place to show the film, since the theater downstairs is really quite nice. I bring this up because I hope this film gets seen by more than the art- house crowd. It really should have mass appeal. I assume Fox hopes to build strong word of mouth on Me and Earl. Well let me help them. Just go see this film. You won't regret it.",

            "content": "'ME AND EARL AND THE DYING GIRL': Four and a Half Stars (Out of Five)Critically acclaimed indie comedy-drama flick; about an awkward high school teen, and his young filmmaking buddy, who befriend a sick classmate with leukemia. The film stars Thomas Mann, Olivia Cooke, Ronald Cyler II, Nick Offerman, Connie Britton, Molly Shannon, Katherine C. Hughes and Jon Bernthal. It was directed by Alfonso Gomez-Rejon (who's most well known for directing popular TV shows, like 'GLEE' and 'AMERICAN HORROR STORY') and it was written by first time feature film writer Jesse Andrews (and based on his book, of the same name). I absolutely love this movie!Greg Gaines (Mann) is a senior at Schenley High School, in Pittsburgh, who's made it through school mostly unnoticed, by only slightly communicating (politely) with everyone (in every social group). He makes short film spoofs, with his best friend Earl (Cyler II); who he's known since childhood. One day, Greg's mother (Britton) informs him that another childhood friend, Rachel (Cooke), has been diagnosed with leukemia. He's then forced, by his mom, to spend time with his sick classmate; against both their wishes. A touching friendship forms. The film is quirky and hilarious, in places. The actors are all perfectly cast and the characters are all lovable, and memorable. It's also a very touching film, and quite depressing (at times); but it's always beautiful to watch, and wonderfully moving. The cinematography is gorgeous and the score is perfectly fitting. The script is brilliant, and clever as well, and the director is definitely one to watch out for. It's sure to become a cult classic, for many years to come, and who wouldn't love that title?!",

            "content": "\"We're not even friends.\" Greg (Mann) is finally a senior. He as survived high school by trying to be invisible to everyone and not causing any drama. When his mother tells him that a classmate (Cooke) has been diagnosed with cancer and that he should hang out with her he hesitates. What starts off as something he is forced to do actually helps him to become who he truly is. If you have teenagers this is a movie they should watch. The movie is a mix of Fault in our Stars and Perks of Being a Wallflower. There is humor and drama in this but the best part about it is that it feels real and nothing about it is forced. The movie could have easily been cheesy and almost after-school-special-like but it stays away from that and becomes something that is truly special. It isn't anything all that original but the writing and acting really make this one of the better movies of this genre and I recommend it. Overall, a movie that could have been very hokey but instead turned out to be very real and heartfelt. A movie teens should watch. If you liked Fault in our Stars you will love this movie. I give it a high B+.",

            "review_title": "Me and Earl and the Dying Girl: Proof That Laughter Can Help Ease the Pain of Dying",
            "content": "Me and Earl and the Dying Girl offers a very accessible, honest, and humorous look at not only how someone deals with being diagnosed with cancer, but it also turns the clich\u00e9s of the coming-of-age story on its nose, and the people behind this film are able to do that by finding the perfect balance between drama and comedy within this unfortunate tragedy. Me and Earl and the Dying Girl centers around Greg (Thomas Mann), a very sarcastic and self-loathing high school student going into his senior year. Greg believes that if he shuts everyone out of his life so that he won't have to deal with anything, then things will be okay, and this gives him a sort of self-gratification. So to uphold his philosophy, he doesn't try to be friends with anyone, but makes sure he's on low-key, good terms with everyone in his school. However, he does spend his time with his co-worker/\"friend\" Earl (RJ Cyler) making parodies of classic foreign cinema together. However, when Greg learns from his mother that a childhood friend of his, Rachel (Olivia Cooke) is diagnosed with Leukemia, Greg begins a blossoming friendship with Rachel; a friendship that would take him through the best of times, the worst of times, and eventually shape him into the person that he will become. While this film definitely shares characteristics with 2014's The Fault in Our Stars (which is a pretty good movie in my opinion), this film to me is more heartfelt and inventive than TFiOS ever was. And most of this has to do with the brilliant screenplay written by Jesse Andrews, who happened to write the book that his film is adapted from. The way that Andrews addresses how to deal with this sickness is wonderfully human and clumsy; whether through comedy, wit, or drama, Andrews finds a way to make the whole scenario relate in some way, shape, or form to anyone and everyone.The direction and cinematography are absolutely incredible. Alfonso Gomez-Rejon, who is known for his work on American Horror Story, and was a personal assistant to Martin Scorsese, shows not only his inventiveness, but his quirkiness as a director on this film. Gomez-Rejon shows his talent with stop motion animation, long panning shots, flashback sequences, and some very long takes that really allow the actors to give the best performances possible. There are even times when this feels like a Wes Anderson film, and this can also be contributed to the gorgeous cinematography. Chung-hoon Chung oozes with style behind the camera, and ultimately the film has a very vibrant look that gave the story being told so much life. These people tell this story with so much care and thought, it's evident that the filmmakers truly respected Andrews' work on the screenplay and wanted to do it the justice it deserves. And thankfully, we got it here.The performances in this film are all magnetic. Every single one of these actors were able to hold their own on screen. The parents in the film, played by Molly Shannon, Connie Britton, and the always delightful Nick Offerman, all do fantastic work. Their relationships with their children are all very grounded in reality and realistically portrayed. Jon Bernthal is incredibly funny as Greg's history teacher, and is able to depict the \"generic cool teacher who understands the main protagonist\" in a different, refreshing light. However, the three leads all steal the show. RJ Cyler serves as a foil to Greg's character. Instead of BS-ing people in order to avoid any direct confrontation, Cyler's Earl is very frank with his language and emotions, and gets right to the core of the problem with Rachel. Olivia Cooke gives a very heartfelt and understated performance in this film, and watching her suffering through this sickness that's eating her up is truly heartbreaking to watch. However, the whole film rides on Thomas Mann's shoulders. His detached performance, and the way he handles Rachel's sickness is so realistically somber. His character actually reminds quite a bit of the characters Anthony Michael Hall played in older John Hughes films. He does a fantastic job with the darker comic moments in the film, and the way his character develops throughout the film is nothing short of stellar. This film won both the Grand Jury Prize and the Audience Award at the Sundance Film Festival this past January, and it's not hard to see why. Me and Earl and the Dying Girl is a film filled with heartbreakingly realistic performances, quirky direction, gorgeous cinematography, and spectacular writing. Whether your an art-house fan, a fan of cinema in general, or just the casual moviegoer, there's something in this film that everyone can relate to. It's in wide release right now, so do yourself a favor and go see it, because it's one of the best films of the year.",

            "content": "I saw this film on a four hour flight. I had it on my list of films to see, but I never got around to seeing it. What we have here is a classically gifted child who tries to hide in the bushes. His friend is a down-to-earth black kid who comes from humble roots. His contributions are more basic. He has a seemingly dangerous brother. The star is a filmmaker, taking classics like \"Apocalypse Now\" and \"Breathless\" and turning them into truncated parodies. The titles are probably better than the movies. One day, his somewhat overbearing mother, lets him know that a classmate of his, a young woman, has leukemia, and that it would be nice to for him to visit her. He reluctantly goes to see her, and it is only his explanation that his mother will make it hell for him if he doesn't spend time with her. What develops is a fascinating connection between the two and love at arm's length. Earl is only a part time player and not a great factor, other than being a refreshing distraction. What makes this movie so wonderful is the natural development of love and friendship, the realities of the illness, and a slow revealing of truths between the two characters. The movie is funny at times and never maudlin, although it has its dark moments as well. I'd not heard of the kids playing the roles, but they are strikingly poignant in their delivery. Nick Offerman, who is only in a couple scenes, plays the father of the boy. He steals every scene he is in. He is an experimenter with life where the young man experiments with film. See this.",

The key to all movies about teenage angst. Possibly the key to all the good movies of all time. If you can compel the viewer to look within and produce a shared experience without the accompanying moral outrage, you have nailed it. Ferris Bueller did this. BRICK did this. ME/EARL does this. Instant classic. Oh Wow. (Ooop -- getting repetitive) 2. Andrews, the writer/adapter, is obviously a film buff. Many film makers have tried to show off their encyclopedic knowledge of film within the confines of their movie -- even the infamous QT, especially the infamous QT -- but nobody was ever this clever. The \"trope\" of giving the main characters a hobby where they spend their spare time spoofing major films is .. brilliant.3. Speaking of brilliant, the tiny Claymation sequence off the top where it is scientifically demonstrated how very pretty girls can destroy a passerby without even realizing it ... is not merely brilliant but iconic. That alone guarantees this film will never be forgotten.4. Cook is a find. She presents as a love child from Jessica Alba (the eyes) and Rachael McAdams (inner glow). A great pedigree.5. I could go on, but hopefully you get the point. Catch this one NOW, because films this good only come along every 6 or 7 years... if you're lucky",

            "content": "It would be easy to criticize the fact that Me & Earl & the Dying Girl appears to have been genetically engineered to be a summer box office moneymaker (Fox Searchlight and Indian Paintbrush have already snatched up the rights for a record- breaking $12 million). It's an adaptation of a young adult novel about adolescent friendship in the midst of terminal illness, which is hot in Hollywood right now thanks to The Fault in Our Stars. Basically, I went in to this film wanting to despise it for its utter marketability. Upon seeing it, however, I was reminded that movies can be commercially successful and good at the same time\u2014and that's okay. The film chronicles the senior year of Greg (Thomas Mann), his friend Earl (R.J. Cyler), and Rachel (Olivia Cooke), who has been diagnosed with leukemia. Though all of the teen dramedy tropes are present\u2014awkward parents, the teacher who gets it, the exploration of high school cliques\u2014the excellent supporting cast keeps the narrative fresh. Greg's parents (Connie Britton and Nick Offerman) add an eccentric jolt of parental weirdness to their scenes, and The Walking Dead's Jon Bernthal takes archetypal cool teacher role into some original territory with his tattoos and battle- scholar vibe. While I found myself wanting more in regards to Rachel's character, the film's treatment of her friendship with Greg is both darkly funny and realistically somber. This is one movie that it's safe to see regardless of its soon-to-be huge commercial appeal. \u2013Alex Springer",

Along with his friend Earl (RJ Cyler), Greg spends his spare time making parodies of their favourite classic movies. When he learns that his childhood friend, Rachel (Olivia Cooke), has been diagnosed with leukemia, he is forced by his overbearing parents to befriend her in her time of need. Through this friendship, Greg soon finds his outlook on life altered.There is always the uneasy feeling of laughing at a film that centres around a girl suffering from cancer. There is great care taken though by director, Alfonso Gomez-Rejon, in making sure that the subject gets the delicate treatment it deserves with the perfect combination of comedy and drama. He is aided by a delightful screenplay from Jesse Andrews, the author of the book the film is adapted from, full of enough wit, charm and quirky cutaway moments, such as the feeling of when the hot girl at school talks to you, to leave you with a smile on your face.The film is elevated to another level by the three main performances from Thomas Mann, RJ Cyler and Olivia Cooke, all showing fine range in both the dramatic and comedic departments. They are supported quite wonderfully by the likes of Nick Offerman, Connie Britton, Jon Bernthal and Molly Shannon, and keep your ears peeled for a funny voice cameo from Hugh Jackman that fits the quirkiness of the film so well.Critics love it and so should audiences, I'm just hoping people decide to go and see it instead of some of the inane drivel that Hollywood produces these days.

            "content": "The independent movie \"Me and Earl and the Dying Girl\" is a rich, creative, emotional, and inspiring narrative that is so much more than a tale of a teenager diagnosed with leukemia. Director Alfonso Gomez-Rejon no se rajo and orchestrates the picture as a quirky gem still respecting that one of its main characters is in a mortal state; and in no way, shape, or form, disrespects that. The film stars Thomas Mann as Greg, a high school student who evades being part of a click in high school, but not having absolute distant from any of them. RJ Cyler co-stars as Earl, Greg's best friend and also film partner. Greg & Earl make eccentric short films with a pun touch on film classics; which personally I think was masterful. My fav of the bunch was Sockwork Orange, which was bloody hilarious. Anyways, back to the story. Greg's mother pressures him to better befriend & be supportive to Rachel (Olivia Cooke), who has just been diagnosed with leukemia. Greg is hesitant at first, but then a very cool friendship blossoms between Greg & Rachel that sure had lots of life in it. Sure, there are a couple of predictable turns in the movie, but it does not hamper the film in one bit. Young thespians Mann, Cyler, and Cooke were very solid in their performances; most notably Cooke. And I loved the supporting work of the underrated Jon Bernthal as Mr. McCarthy, the unorthodox history teacher who becomes some sort of new wave mentor for Greg. Jesse Andrews' adapted screenplay of his novel is Oscar-worthy and I wish I had Jesse's world of script talent. So liven up your life just a little bit, and go visit \"Me and Earl and the Dying Girl\". It's the best movie I have seen so far in 2015. ***** Excellent",

He's not anti-social, as he goes out of his way to talk to people of all different social groups and cliques, fully intent on never getting too close to call them \"friends\" and operating just basically enough so he can never become fully immersed in their life or embarrass himself. His friend, though he won't call him that, is Earl (Ronald Cyler II), who has been by his side for years, as the two make low-budget parodies of classic films (IE: \"A Sockwork Orange\" is their version of \"A Clockwork Orange,\" Jean-Luc Godard's \"Breathless\" becomes \"Breath Less,\" a film about a man's attachment to his inhaler, and \"Midnight Cowboy\" becomes \"2:48 P.M. Cowboy\"). Despite these films blatantly being awful, the two continue their productions for reasons they can't even adequately explain.One day, Greg's mother makes Greg visit the home of Rachel Kushner (Olivia Cooke), a girl Greg's age who has just been diagnosed with leukemia, to express his well wishes and give her some company. Right from the get-go, despite being loved and embraced by Rachel's mother (Molly Shannon), who is constantly sipping alcohol following her divorce and her daughter's diagnosis, Rachel detects the obligation of Greg's visit. Nonetheless, the two make casual small talk, with Rachel revealing her normal side and Greg continuing to harp on his awkward, self-hating side with little tact and emotion. He remains in a constant state of mellow carelessness at all times, but grows close to Rachel, even going the distance to working with Earl to make a movie for her when she begins chemotherapy and becomes increasingly withdrawn.\"Me and Earl and the Dying Girl\" immediately feels like a Wes Anderson picture that tackles realm of quirky teenage films so heavily that it becomes twee and almost petty. The opening sequence alone reminded me how tired I was of hearing stories that begin with \"this is not your typical high school love story\" or the continued affirmation of the main character's unique story by saying \"this is the part where her and I should kiss\" or \"this is not your typical romance.\" This has gone from being subversive and innovative to a cloying attempt to be original and unique, incessantly reminding the audience that your story is different.Yet, \"Me and Earl and the Dying Girl\" is special because, much like Rick Famuyiwa's \"Dope,\" released last week, it reminds how people are much more complex than films often portray. \"Dope\" focused on the perils of living in South Central Los Angeles and getting caught up in gang activity all while struggling to remain true to yourself, find yourself, and stay in tune with your morals. With that, \"Dope\" showed how a person is not easily defined and there were many shades of gray in defining a human and his choices.This film operates on the same plane. Scenes with Greg and Rachel do not go the way we expect at all. At no moment does Greg comfort Rachel by holding her, caressing her, kissing her, or giving her the reactionary statement that \"everything's gonna be all right.\" At no point does he really ever give her a reason to smile because he is being flattering or particularly kind to her. Quite frequently, I found myself being really surprised at his behavior; it's unlike most behavior we see between two adolescents in film, but yet, not uncommon of adolescents in the real world.Films have shaped our ideas about teenagers in a way that paints many of them as stereotypes or members of an easily defined class. Films like this, \"Kids,\" and \"The Breakfast Club\" have worked to paint richer, more realistic pictures, showing the grayness in defining adolescents and showing that the emotions they feel, the decisions they make, and the paths they work to forge for themselves can be just as daunting as the priorities many adults face each and every day. If nothing else, \"Me and Earl and the Dying Girl\" reminds, if not, informs, that teens aren't easily defined caricatures - some sit before computers and edit their own makeshift films with their friend with posters of Martin Scorsese's \"Mean Streets\" and Fran\u00e7ois Truffaut's \"The 400 Blows\" neatly hung on the walls behind them.\"Me and Earl and the Dying Girl\" also mixes the brutally honest, complex emotions of \"The Perks of Being a Wallflower\" with the basic premise (but not mawkish sentimentality and ultimate corniness) of \"The Fault in Our Stars.\" Mann proves to be an interesting character, almost an anti-hero in his ability to love or be loved because of his own stubborn attitude and coldness to the idea of personal connection. Kushner also gives a tremendously affecting performance on a low-key level, with emotional scenes that hit right on the noise. They're not too overdrawn and they're not too cutely resolved or painted; they're brutally, unequivocally real.The only thing burdening the film is its obsession with its own quirkiness and its increasingly irritating ability to try and remain meta and different. The film's insistence on its own desire to be unique unintentionally undermines Jesse Andrews' compelling, heartwrenching story and Alfonso Gomez-Rejon's (who also directed the strong remake of \"The Town That Dreaded Sundown\") directing, which resembles the astute, symmetrical-precision of Wes Anderson. \"Me and Earl and the Dying Girl,\" however, ultimately succeeds in showing humans, particularly adolescents, as they naturally are - complex, sometimes detached, but never boring.",

            "content": "Crafted with intimacy, told with composure & made all the more heartwarming by wonderful performances from its cast, Me and Earl and the Dying Girl is another unexpected delight of the year that surprises & stirs in equal doses, brims with a refreshing energy from beginning to end, and is a welcome addition to the coming-of-age dramas.Based on the novel of the same name, the story of Me and Earl and the Dying Girl focuses on Gary, a high-school senior who spends most of his time making parodies of classic films with his partner, Earl, and has a very low opinion of himself. However, his perspective of life is altered when he befriends a classmate who's recently diagnosed with cancer.Directed by Alfonso Gomez-Rejon in what is his sophomore effort & scripted by the novel's author himself, the movie opens on a predictable note but slowly & steadily manages to win that viewers' hearts, thanks to its excellent grip on storytelling elements & naturally building charm. While Gomez-Rejon keeps the tone lighthearted for the most part, he finishes it on a high with a gut-wrenching finale.The short films parodying past cinematic gems is both amusing & admirable to look at, the stop-motion animation is another pleasing element and these little stuffs offer more insight into the characters inhabiting the film, while adding something to the story that's entirely its own. Camera-work & editing work in tandem and its 105 minutes of runtime is aptly utilised. Music is in sync with unfolding events & is at its best during the climax.Coming to the performances, the film features a young but promising cast in Thomas Mann, RJ Cyler & Olivia Cooke who play Greg, Earl & Rachel aka the dying girl, respectively. Each actor does justice to his or her part and it's a balanced performance from all three of them which only gets better as the story progresses. There are many long takes in the movie and these actors do an amazing job in those moments by keeping their expressions in tune with the given situation.On an overall scale, Me and Earl and the Dying Girl is a touching, heartfelt & poignant story that packs in a lot of heart, warmth, laughs & tears, and saves its best for the final act. The film doesn't try to be pitiful or sappy because of a dying person in it, but aims to show how laughter, comfort & companionship can at least ease all sorts of pain, if not cure it. The final climactic moment is mesmerising & heartbreaking at the same time but the epilogue makes sure that the story ends on a fitting note. Definitely recommended.",

            "content": "Me and Earl and the Dying Girl is based on the novel of the same name by Jesse Andrews, who also wrote the screenplay. The film was directed by Alfonso Gomez-Rejon, a one-time assistant to Martin Scorsese. The story is set in Pittsburgh and its protagonist is Greg Gaines (Thomas Mann), a teenager who maintains superficial relationships with most of the cliques in the high school he attends. A good part of the opening scenes involve stuff we've seen before in countless other movies that feature high school kids\u2014there are the usual geeks, Goths and that one good looking girl on whom the main character has a crush. Greg also has hippies for parents with his sociology professor dad dressing often in a sarong and enamored with exotic cuisine, and a mother who is perennially imbibing a glass of wine which undoubtedly helps her be more sociable.Greg's African-American friend Earl comes from lower socioeconomic circumstances and the family has virtually \"adopted\" him since childhood. Greg dubs Earl a \"co-worker,\" unable to call him a friend \u2014 they spend a great deal of time concocting parodies of famous films, often using Claymation or stop-action animation (perhaps the neatest aspect of the film). Earl is a weak character as he basically serves the function of being Greg's sidekick\u2014he has little to do throughout the narrative except having a temporary falling out with Greg over the \"dying girl\" of the title.The \"dying girl\" is Greg's fellow student Rachel\u2014when Greg's mother hears that Rachel has leukemia, she sends her son over to visit her and they quickly become friends. Madison (the good looking student on whom Greg has a crush) convinces him to make one of his quirky movies for Rachel. Eventually Greg and Rachel have their own falling out over her decision to stop chemotherapy treatments. Undoubtedly echoing the beliefs of the films' scenarists, Greg self-righteously castigates Rachel for giving up the \"treatment\" which he believes is the only thing that might save her (why is chemo the only alternative for cancer victims in the movies?). Trusting her own instincts, Rachel decides that the chemo is only making her worse and decides to go off of it. Greg finally comes to his senses and I suppose realizes that not accepting Rachel's decision was selfish on his part. So instead of going to the prom with Madison, he brings the movie that he and Earl made for Rachel, and shows it to her on her deathbed. Rachel, like Earl, is there to highlight Greg's coming of age story. She's merely the \"cancer victim\" that helps Greg come out of his shell\u2014 hardly what you would call a \"fleshed out\" character. Andrews is content to manipulate our emotions by stating the obvious\u2014the death of a family member or friend from cancer is always a sad story indeed.Greg's emergence as a more mature, less self-absorbed youth, now headed for college, is the big lesson we're supposed to take from all this. Somehow it's the idea of a dying girl in itself that leads the protagonist to a great epiphany. I say a dying girl is a manipulative trope and inspiration for growth should not come from the cemetery.",

            "review_title": "Goes Beyond A Dying Child Drama",
            "content": "To say that \"Me and Earl and the Dying Girl\" is another tear-inducing dying child melodrama doesn't really understand what the story is about. Under the direction of Alfonzo Gomez-Rejon and a script written by Jesse Andrews who also wrote the novel this movie is based on, they have succeeded into touching upon this serious issue without you having to reach for the tissue box every five minutes, while throwing in comical moments at the time that seems fit, and eccentric enough that it doesn't become overkill. There might be few wrong steps in some places, but it won't lower your hopes in watching this movie. In the long run, it balances in the right times as when we should laugh and when we should cry.The story is told from the visual aspect of our leading character Greg Gaines (Thomas Mann) whose narration is off kilter and was rightfully meant that way as to manipulate us into continue watch it and to avoid the formulaic route by spoonfeeding us scene by scene of what is to come next. Greg succeeds to keep us off guard by from the name of the title we are expecting this to be an emotionally drained tearful film, but we the audience find out that's not the case. Greg's inner thoughts and imagination materialize before our very eyes in the form of animated montages that border on being too adorable and artful, but still original and light in content albeit a bit out of place at times.Greg is a self-contained high school student who's getting through school without hanging out in groups, while not entirely making enemies. His future is met with uncertainty and his mindset in the present is cynical and drab. The only friend he has is a kid named Earl (RJ Cyler) who he refers to as his co-worker, passes their time making home movie spoofing the classic films like \"Anatomy of a Murder\" becomes \"Anatomy of a Burger\". Greg has no real direction in life and seems reluctant in applying to any colleges. His mother (Connie Britton) tries to break his shelled life by making him befriend a peer and neighbour named Rachel Kushner (Olivia Cooke) who's been diagnosed with leukemia, much to his reluctance.The relationship and chemistry between Greg and Rachel is perfectly real and feels organically like you would expect when someone you know needs the comfort and support at the most trying times of your life. At first they don't want to be at each other's company, which is understanding at first, but as the movie progresses, they eventually like their time spent together. What makes their relationship stand out is that the pairing don't fall under the formulaic trapping of becoming romantically attracted to each other. The way these two are dealing with her declining health is complex but effective, especially coming from young individuals who think that they are too young to die like their immune. There's no denying that Greg and Rachel have a love for one another, but they keep their thoughts esoteric let alone never seal their relationships with a mutual kiss. Their mutual platonic relationship stands out as being one of the stronger ones in film history and that they let their emotions towards each other do the kissing for them.It was a smart move for Gomez-Rejon to settle for a cast of relative unknowns then to overdo it highly prolific superstars because it's just so refreshing to see what they have to offer than compared to those who we know what to expect. Olivia Cooke's portrayal of a cancer patient is more believable than compared to other screen characters who haved played this role before. Thomas Mann suceeds in his role by remaining subtle and captures his role to great effect. Mann shows no apologies to make his character unfriendly, but if it's written in the script, Mann will likely comply to what's on the script. Molly Shannon displays the right amount of sadness and angst as she abides to her methods in coping with heartbreak knowing that her daughter is suffering and that her chances of survival are getting slimmer. The only character I couldn't fully get invested was Nick Offerman's role as Greg's dad, he was too hip and eccentric and spends too much time talking to his cat.It's a great relief that this movie is saturated with enough comedy to prevet the narrative from becoming a sentimental tearful film. The lighter tones also never usurp the dramatic angles. Though not as well-known in the movie industry, Gomez-Rejon directs with outstanding command. It even upstages another cancer themed film \"A Fault in Our Stars\" by avoiding the trapping of focusing too much on the cancer story, by adding some comedy to lighten the atmosphere. It was no surprise that this movie struck it rich at the 2015 Sundance Film Festival by winng top prizes like the Grand Jury Prize and the Audience Award. It deserves the credibility by remaining intelligent and coming to terms of an emotional story and gives the audience the liberty to embrace what's featured here than being forced into it.",

            "content": "Me and Earl and the Dying Girl is one of those rare teenage movies that actually depicts teenagers. I never said it does it all that well, but at least it gives it an honest effort. It often feels true to the spirit of youth in that the film is slow, uncertain, ordinary, and slightly crude. The main characters aren't supermodels (although they ain't ugly), and they carry themselves in an exaggerated, basic form of what a teenager truly is. It is a refreshing and hopeful move away from the action-packed and otherwise soulless frameworks of modern teenage films, all the way from ridiculous vampires to ridiculous dystopias.Despite this impressive regression to reality, it isn't perfect, coming off more as a stepping stone to a (perhaps exclusively teenage) cinematic era of real people doing real things. The teenagers are way too intelligent, always ready with a witty remark to shatter conversation barriers that most teenagers would find almost insurmountable. Everyone has a powerfully distinguishing feature, whether they're gorgeous, creative, or just plain weird. It's as if a thirty-year old man clinging onto the vestiges of his youth decided to write a book about a segment of his life that he barely remembers. And it is.But all this is simply a minor problem. The script's bumps are more than made up for by the wonderful acting. This film was one of the few where I could actually appreciate the acting as more than a vehicle for the plot. Thomas Mann, Olivia Cooke and RJ Cyler have brilliant chemistry as the main characters of this film. Their dynamic is always brilliantly up-and-down, ranging from friendly conversation to boiling rage. It is always nice to see young actors who can actually act.And now for the plot. This is where the beauty of the film resides, and also its major, unavoidable drawback. First, its beauty. Greg, a self-loathing teenager with a fear of commitment (typical teenager, either they hate or love themselves) spends his days making parodies of classic films with his buddy Earl (who he prefers to call his \"coworker\"). His life seems aimless and disconnected from the real world, as if he is wrapped up in himself so tightly that he refuses to let reality penetrate his own defenses. After his mother's incessant urging, he is forced into a \"doomed friendship\" with Rachel, another teenage girl who just happens to have a terminal illness (hence the \"dying girl\" of the title). Through this girl, whom he immediately establishes a connection with, he overcomes his own fear of connection, and eventually becomes attuned to his own creative spirit, which he reveals to us in the beautiful, heartbreaking climax of the film.But when I thought about it, I realized that I had a problem with all this. This movie relied on character development (and to a lesser extent cinematography and acting). The main character developed. But at what cost? The death of a young girl. Do filmmakers have the right to kill someone who has barely lived in pursuit of a theme that could be achieved using much more subtle methods? Must we face the death of someone we love in order to change? This common theme (perhaps even a celebration) of death in teenage films is disturbing.So like I said, it gives it an effort, and that effort is much appreciated. But the exploitation of death is a bit more than I am able to admire.",

Little indie films that are just all about their story and their characters and don't need loud explosions or car chases to keep you entertained. Instead, they do it through exquisite dialogue. Dialogue that makes you care, that makes you think and most of all makes you feel. That's not to say that every quirky little indie film is good. That's certainly not the case, there are a lot of stinkers out there. 'Me and Earl and the Dying Girl' is certainly not one them though.The subject of cancer is always an emotional one. Any time you see the word mentioned in a film's synopsis you know you're in for an affecting film in some way or shape. That doesn't make it any easier to deal with when the time comes around though. This film is undoubtedly a tear-jerker. It has that effect because the writing is so good in the lead up. No movie has ever completely nailed high school life (and likely never will, because they are forced to cast beautiful Hollywood actors in the lead roles and that simply isn't the case in real life), but any film that can make you relate in any way to that time of your life and make you appreciate, at least to an extent, what certain characters are going through has done an excellent job.

Then you have Earl, The cool black kid, who really should be the Alpha male in films like this but somehow ends up the more well-adjusted side kick. Then you have the Dying girl, Rachael who would have been the Wallflower love interest Greg wouldn't notice past friendship until the end of the movie, but because she's dying she gets all of his attention but not of his love, as the filmmakers decided to avoid this one stereotypical story arch and kept reminding us they are avoiding it throughout the movie.A lot of the movies laughter does come out of making fun of the fact that this is Greg's story, a story we seen a butch of times in a butch of movies with the main cast, including Greg himself telling him to get over himself.I especially liked the short bad films within the film made by Greg and Earl that parody film titles (400 blows parodies as 400 bros.)The movie had a string of well done characters from the main cast to the supporting characters that made up the adults, like Molly Shannon and Nick Offerman.Overall, I loved the movie.

The main character is portrayed by Thomas Mann. I haven't seen him in any other films, but judging by his age, he has a great career to look forward to. His chemistry with Rachel (played by Olivia Cooke) is spectacular. Not only is the build up done so well, but the way they deliver lines at each other and how the create inside jokes is a pleasure to witness on screen. I could talk for ages about the great actors in this movie, but the best way to describe them is 'real'.Story and Dialogue: The story is surprisingly simple, but that doesn't take away from the fact that the execution of it has been done with care. Thankfully the filmmakers knew about the fact that you have probably heard this story numerous times, so they found a believable way to sort of make fun of it without taking away from the tone. The dialogue is often so fun and relate able. It is filled with clever jokes or comments about high school, life or sickness. This is the type of movie where you want to grab your phone or your notes every few minutes to write down that awesome quote.Editing and Pacing: In these types of movies I'm always kind of nervous if there isn't a long middle-part where the pace hugely goes down. The length is as perfect as it can be. If it was longer it could have become boring and if it was shorter it would have been too rushed. In the terms of editing it has definitely some stand-out moments, there are some really fun stop-motion segments or creative filmmaking bits (keeping things vague because of spoilers).Cinematography and Effects: The cinematography in this film is just lovely to watch. Not only are there some really neat camera tricks but it makes use of the entire screen instead of just the middle. Aside from that, the colors and the symmetry in the short look awesome, it actually manages to make high school look beautiful. Also a lot of repetition is found between several shots with different meanings, you can really see that the filmmakers put effort in making a film with usage of visual ques to tell a story.Rewatchability: In a lot of movies like this I feel like there normally isn't much rewatchability value. Once you finally know what's going to happen it could make your second viewing less interesting. I feel like the value in this film is much greater though, mostly because of the combination of great characters mixed with genuine dialogue. I was so invested in the characters that I would mind seeing them a second, third or perhaps even a fourth time. In terms of foreshadowing, there is quite a lot of it, some of it in some small character moments that you wouldn't even notice when paying not enough attention. This would definitely make your second watching worth wile.Deeper Meaning or Motives/Themes: This movie has quite a lot to say about dealing with illness (obviously), finding your place in school or in your social life, having friends, showing yourself and being who you are and showing your creativity.Tone: The tone of the movie is so interesting. I should say it's a drama, but on the other hand, this movie is funny as hell, but I also wouldn't consider this a comedy. It's like a drama with great comedic elements. Aside from that the tone is really consistent and it didn't do anything that took me out of the movie, I stayed invested throughout the entire film.Personal Response: With the smart and fun dialogue this movie grabbed me pretty quick. Then after a while I became invested in the characters. After like half an hour I was wondering if they would go the easy way with the story. Then the movie surprisingly took a few turns that I didn't expect and it kept me interested in the story. Something really interesting that this movie did to me which had never occurred to me before was that I felt the emotion several minutes after the movie had ended. Normally there are certain scenes that give you the feels, but this time I felt it after and it still kept me engaged. When a movie can accomplish something like that, it earns my deepest respect. Conclusion: 'Me and Earl and the Dying Girl' is a believable film with wonderful portrayed characters and with great things to say about illness, social life and creativity. 10/10",

Hughes, Matt Bennett, Masam Holden (Cameo voice-over: Hugh Jackman) Excellent coming-of-age dramedy based on Jesse Andrews' novel (he adapted his book here) about a film geek teenager (Mann who resembles a hybrid of Matthew Modine by way of David Duchovny) enlisted by his well-meaning mother (Britton) to visit one of his neighboring classmates (Cooke who echoes the valentine-faced Jessica Harper) who has been diagnosed with leukemia. Awkward, straight-forward, heartfelt and wonderfully aching with every scene of want, desire, love, humor and the best things in life: friendship that knows no other name. Respectful of its themes and fanciful in its execution with Mann and best bud Cyler teaming up as filmmakers who recreate classic movies as intended-to-be-terrible valentines ala Michel Gondry and in the process solidify their relationship too boot. Director Alfonso Gomez-Rejon combines rare beauty, honesty and just how hellish high school angst and anomie can be while Andrews' story of too-destined-to-be friends facing insurmountable odds as a brand new wrinkle in the 'dying girl and the unlucky boy' genre. One of the year's very best; a must see and so what \"The Fault In Our Stars\" attempted (and epic failed) to do so.",

            "content": "With a beautiful storyline and an excellence cast, Me Earl & the Dying Girl is a coming of age film that is both touching and charming on so many levels. It features a unique and sincere story that veers away from the cliches of standard cancer teen drama. After all, this isn't a love story as Greg would say. Devoid of sappy, teenage love, the film instead focuses on the unconventional friendships between the socially conscious Greg, his hilarious, doesn't give a crap \"co-worker\" Earl and Rachel, the dying girl who is flat out endearing and adorable. Through the interactions of these highly relatable and well acted characters, we are treated to boisterous laughter & overwhelming sadness, clear products of the AMAZING chemistry between the three. Another aspect that renders this film highly likeable, is the Wes Anderson style directing. The camera panning, use of clay in stop motion style, the bright and pastel colors, all worked out very well. The classic film references is sure to bring cheers to cinephiles as well.Overall, the powerful themes of TRUE friendship is something I adore from this film. Sure it isn't a masterpiece, but it is heartfelt and real. It's clear why this was a Sundance winner. 8/10.",

            "content": "This is a beautiful little film. It contains a gem of a story, strongly highlighted by the bizarre but magnificent direction of Alfonso Gomez-Rajon. With the use of weird and raw camera angles, interesting narrative and timely use of stop motion techniques, the film individually stands out as a must see coming-of-age production.Based on the novel by Jesse Andrews, who also lent his talents to the screenplay, the production genuinely tries to give us a perspective of the bona fide thoughts of a youth growing up in Pittsburgh suburbia where fitting in is still as relevant now as it was twenty years ago.Generation X had 'The Breakfast Club' and Generation Y had 'American Pie' and this generation has 'Me and Earl........'. In years to come when they are all reminiscing about their coming of age moments, they'll look back and say, \"Do you remember the film, Me and Earl........\". What this film has been able to do is find the right balance between idiosyncratic comedy and heart felt drama, that when meshed together portrays a very authentic sense of realism that resonates with its audience.Greg (Thomas Mann) is a loner by choice who has awkwardly been able to survive the stifling nature of high school by strategically alienating himself from the sorted 'packs' that form inside the walls of educational institutions. His best mate (and only mate), Earl (RJ Cyler), who Greg regards as his co-worker, have formed a friendship that has stemmed back to their kindergarten years, based on their love of foreign cinema. Over the years the two co-workers have delightfully produced their own film productions that are a virtual send up of iconic movies from the past. With titles such as \"A Sockwork Orange\" and \"2:46pm Cowboy\", the two high schoolers go about giving these homemade movies their own little makeover.Greg's protected world is thrust into reality when his over zealous mother (Connie Britton) nags her son into spending time with Rachel (Olivia Cooke) who has just been diagnosed with cancer. After some tense initial moments, the two find that they actually rather like each other and a very heart warming friendship begins. Greg is then talked into making a movie for his new friend but has difficulty in finding the right formula.A very balanced cast delivers a film that could just be the movie of the year. Stand out performances by the two leads in Thomas Mann and RJ Cyler drive a story that impacts the soul of every person willing to take the time to watch it. A wonderful cameo from Nick Offerman who portrays Greg's dad. His laid back, easy going father figure who has a taste for exotic foods plays out beautifully along side Greg and Earl who seem to just go with his unusual likings.This is a film for everybody and will not only resonate with its targeted audience but will leave a lasting impression on older viewers. This is a movie that oozes emotion. You'll laugh and you'll cry. I ALMOST did.",

Earl is hardly seen in the film, and the friendship between the two boys wasn't plausible or believable. Earl was not portrayed in a very sympathetic manner and seemed to me to be a cold, distant, unlikeable character. There was no chemistry between Greg and Rachel, and the film began to take on a morbid, hopeless feeling as it progressed. I have to agree with another reviewer here that the picture seemed more interested in being cute (the short films the two boys made, the self-deprecating humor from Greg) than developing any real characters or relationships between them all. I enjoyed \"The Fault in Our Stars,\" and this reminded me of an attempt to cash in on the same audience, but it didn't have anywhere near the heart that the former film did. It would have been much more meaningful if Greg and Rachel had voiced some acknowledgement at the end that they had meant something to each other. Instead, the film tries so desperately not to be sentimental that it comes across as very distant and emotionless. The film had a very promising beginning, but went way downhill as it progressed.",

            "content": "If I had to pick a single genre of Hollywood movies to save from a global catastrophe, I'd go with the coming of age films. Because it's probably the only type of films in which it's not just about business and grossing revenues. Such movies are also a way to establish a communication between generations, to talk to our youth and both teach them something and explain that the world around isn't as cold and ugly as they might think. Not every film succeeds at that cultural mission, but at least most sincerely try. Which, in the modern world where kids are especially estranged from their parents, is a big deal indeed.Me and Earl and the Dying Girl is another step forward in this intergenerational dialogue. But, unlike some parents who honestly believe that since they are not young themselves then their kids' issues are nothing but some laughable nonsense, this film never ridicules its heroes.Nor does it oversweeten things. MaEatDG might sound similar to The Fault In Our Stars because it revolves around the topic of cancer, but, besides that, those films have nothing in common. And it's a good thing, because the last thing TFiOS had was sincerity. Instead, that movie glamorized cancer and that feeling of being terminally ill as if it's some sexy little perk that only makes you more appealing or interesting. However, death is definitely no fun, and fighting death might be an even less of it, which is the dark part of the picture MaEatDG didn't shy away from showing. Showing without making things pretty or convenient, and showing without intentionally making them too ugly to squeeze yet another tear of forcibly induced sympathy. Nah, unlike John Green, Jesse Andrews, on whose novel this film is based upon, decided to use more delicate colors and emotional intonations to make the story of Greg and Rachel both believable and relatable.One needs a big talent to make a gripping story about the things that happen to people routinely. And let's be sincere: just like becoming an adult, death is something most of us have a first-hand knowledge about. So I'm genuinely amazed how Alfonso Gomez-Rejon managed to pull off a movie so deep and touching about the issues so familiar and maybe even banal: finding your true self, establishing a real cost of friendship, learning to love others and yourself, fighting for personal liberty of creativity and choice. When we grow older, we tend to lose those memories of the time when we were still in the making as humans. And if this film manages to remind someone on the older side how it is to be that ball of clay, still unsure which shape to take, and maybe show someone on the younger side that the life is beautiful enough to find courage to explore it, then Hollywood hasn't been completely in vain.",

When Fox starts its classic movie channel to compete against Arch-Rival Ted Turner and CNN's current old movie recycling center, expect to see loads of similar Renamings from the folks who invented Fake News and Alternative Facts. For instance, SHOOTING THE BREEZE is a much more indefinite approach to the War to End Racist Southern Dudes' Black Slavery than GONE WITH THE WIND (four words which suggest gloom and doom). Similarly, TITANIC has become a buzzword for terrible tragedy, so expect Fox to screen History's second-most popular bladder-buster as SHOOTING FOR A TRANS-ATLANT!C CROSSING RECORD. John Steinbeck's indictment of the Rich People Party's Government Of-, By-, and For the Fat Cat One Per Centers--GRAPES OF WRATH--won't sit well with Fox's target audience (most of whom possess brains held hostage by Stockholm Syndrome), so Fox will try to maintain ratings by offering it as a more Panglossian-sounding SHOOTS OF GRASS.

I could see why some viewers compare this movie to \"The Fault in Our Stars\". Mainly because it's a relationship between a teenage boy and a girl, except this time the girl has cancer and not both of them. But that is where the similarities stop. The dialogue is better and the interactions between the characters was more heartfelt and enjoyable in \"The Fault in Our Stars\". But this was just such a relatable movie, sure the high school lifestyle and interactions maybe slightly stereotypical. But it's all so darn relatable that I got immersed in just the few minutes into this movie. I really got into the witty, quirky and zany aspect of this movie. The main protagonist is this insecure teenage boy named Greg, who feels he needs to wear a mask to survive high school. Who likes to make short films with his friend Earl. That starts to have a in-depth relationship between a girl with cancer. I especially liked the interaction and between Greg and Earl, since despite them both liking films their mindset is very different. Sure Greg is a bit of a coward and more socially awkward, but his flaws makes him relatable. And Earl is the suave and more insightful, he is also a cool friend. I didn't feel the level emotion I felt in \"The Fault in Our Stars\", but again the interactions between the characters just seemed more relatable. This isn't a romance movie, but a heartfelt and endearing relationship between friends and the hardships of trying to keep something that can't last forever. This is a film I highly recommend, it won't work for some mainstream viewers. But I liked it.8.3/10",

            "content": "\"Me and Earl and the Dying Girl\" is a difficult film to like, but even more difficult to dislike. The protagonist is an emotionally detached teenager who makes corny parodies of classic films and secretly loves a high school hottie who is out of his league. He confronts several dramatic challenges. He needs to learn to show real emotion and to accept the friendship of others. He needs to mature in his passion for cinema and take his corny amateurish films to a level of genuine filmmaking where he will actually take pride in showing them to others. And he needs to channel his sexual urges into an actual relationship instead of avoiding any contact with any other student, especially the girl of his fantasies. He has a couple of other challenges as well. He needs to stop being a high school student and get into college where he can develop skills for a future career. And he needs to develop a relationship with the dying girl, which is a sort of allegory for the other challenges in his life. Like \"Inglourious Basterds,\" \"The Deal\" and \"The Player,\" the film is about cinema, filmmakers and filmmaking. On one hand, the corny little parodies that Greg and Earl make are a brilliant device for establishing the character of the two male leads and providing a mechanism to show Greg's maturation and emotional attachment to Rachel. But ultimately the parodies seem vacuous. They're like the cereal box in \"2001: A Space Odyssey\" or the produce in \"The Interview,\" realistic outside, but phony inside. When it comes time for Greg and Earl to actually produce a movie with genuine emotion for Rachel, we see that they have some good footage of their interviews, but in the end he cops out and does an elaborate stop-motion animation that has (at least in the part we see) no relevance to her life, unless it's a cynical statement that inanimate things can be given the illusion of life. In a deus ex machina event of inconceivable proportions, given the scale of the story, he is given an opportunity for romance with the putatively hottest girls in school, but reverts to his selfish, misanthropic ways and stands her up for an important date, doubtlessly humiliating her before her classmates, and suffers no consequences. While one could argue that he broke the date for altruistic reasons, the manner in which he did so seems callous and suggests he has not grown at all emotionally. If one views his dramatic challenge as easing Rachel's passing and the film itself as Greg's story of his adolescence, then one could argue that he prevailed. But if one views his relationship with Rachel as learning to express himself emotionally so he can establish relationships with others, especially Madison, he fails miserably and ends the film pretty much the same misanthropic jerk he was at the beginning. And he still has no direction in his life. He actively applies for entrance to Pitt, but why Pitt? If his entire life has been about filmmaking. He should be trying to get into a film school. The film is disappointing in the way that it shows considerable promise, but could have been better. The hokey amateur videos were a brilliant device, but are used more as a gimmick than an allegory. The father and the history professor are fascinated by exotic foods, but the food that has the greatest impact turns out to be a batch of cookies. Rachel is a pretty girl and Earl is fascinated by her breasts, but Greg never kisses her. The film has numerous good elements and clever ideas that aren't quite developed as well as they could have been. Performances are good. Technical aspects are adequate. A few shots are unsteady and the cinematographer engages in a few self-indulgent odd camera angles and movements. A few scenes, such as the fight scene in the cafeteria, seem like they were done in one shot and might have benefited from additional takes and camera angles. Dialogue is good, especially for the two mothers, but even the limo driver has some decent lines.",

Constant screen titles of what day we are on or where we are written like titles of \"Friends\" episodes get old. The cinematography that looks like it was shot on a cel phone throws in overhead shots that just distract.The kids would obviously shoot their movies digitally but they went out of the way to show the holes at the 50 foot reel ends of eight millimeter film. Actually the stupid little films they made were the most interesting things in the movie. Seems unlikely a supposedly Jewish girl would find her way to the fireplace mantel.Looking for a good kid dying movie try \"The Fault in Our Stars\".

The movies that Greg and his friend Earl make were a hoot. Some wonderful stop-motion animation in this movie, particularly in the little movie Earl and Greg make for Rachel.

            "content": "'Me and Earl and the Dying Girl' is another screen adaptation of a Young Adult novel of the same name written by Jesse Andrews who also serves as the screenplay writer for the film. The story progresses from the protagonist Greg's perspective who is pretty much in every scene of the film. He is an awkward boy in high school. He clearly feels like an outsider in the high school environment and has no identity. He has no friends and his self-esteem is also very low. But he has a companion named Earl whom he calls his 'co-worker'. Both being huge cinephiles, they spend their time making low-budget, comedic remakes of classic art-house films. But then Greg's mother makes him spend some time with Rachel, a schoolmate who has been diagnosed with leukemia, so that Greg could give her company and cheer her up a little. His interaction with Rachel makes Greg understand and realise a lost of things about life, death and his own self.Let me first mention the things that I liked. First of all I really liked Olivia Cooke as Rachel, the titular dying girl with cancer. She gives an understated performance and I found her sweet and adorable. The friendship between Greg and Earl is likable. They don't hug a lot, but their friendship still comes off as believable. The direction during the initial half of the film remains likable. The film constantly references classic films, and as a hardcore cinephile, I found that pleasantly satisfying. There are admirable uses of the camera. The director uses both tracking shots as well as static long shots from time to time skilfully. There is one particular scene in the film which is filmed in a single long shot with static camera that really impressed me. The acting from Olivia Cooke and Thomas Mann in that scene was impressive.One of the biggest complaints that I have against the films based on Young Adult novels is that I think they try really, extremely hard to make the viewer cry. You will see the director along with the screenplay writer pull out all the clich\u00e9s in the book and crank the sentimentality up to 11. But these tactics invariably make me cringe instead of cry. I treat a filmmaker's ability to make me cry with the utmost sanctity. But that happens when a director can make you feel the emotions and overwhelm you, instead of throwing sentiment and clich\u00e9s at your face. Unfortunately Me and Earl and the Dying Girl is another film that takes the desperate route to make the viewer cry and from a personal standpoint fails. The issues that Greg struggles with also felt a bit tacky and uninteresting. I am not one of those individuals who complains about people struggling with first world problems in films. Just because you're financially stable doesn't mean you can't have problems in your life. But the self esteem issues in the film felt very trivial. I know the characters that appear other than the 3 titular characters are introduced through the perspective of Greg, so they need not be very realistic. But all of them are nothing but caricatures and the director couldn't even remotely humanise them. Talented actors like Connie Britton and Nick Offerman have next to nothing to offer. As a whole the film has elements that work, but in an overall sense, it failed to win me over. I didn't hate it. But I wouldn't jump at the prospect of watching it again either.",

            "content": "'Me and Earl and the Dying Girl' is not just another coming of age movie, nor it is a teenage rom-com nor an after school special schlock-fest. It is a touching, unique view of a year in the life of a Greg, Earl and the 'Dying Girl', regular high school kids, one with a life-threatening condition.Greg is in self imposed exile; he's a high-school senior who has skirted through life without making many attachments. He prefers it that way. He chooses not to play the along with the clicks and that leaves him an isolated nation of one. Then one day, reasons not explained in the movie, his mother cajoles him into visiting Rachel, the dying girl. Rachel is kept at a linguistic distance as even the movie's title attempts to distance the main character from himself and Rachel. Instead of Greg, Earl and Rachel, only Earl's name is used. That demonstrates Earl's catalytic role in the film.Rachel wisely sees through Greg's \"bullshit\" when he arrives at her house. But he makes her laugh and accepts her sharp criticisms of his foibles. And that is the start of a 'doomed friendship.' Earl is Greg's 'business partner', what most kids would call 'friends.' They film goofy send-ups of classic movies using titles like 'The 400 Bros' (The 400 Blows) and '2:48 Cowboy' (Midnight Cowboy). How they started making these spoofs, we don't know, but by the time the films starts they have quite a catalog.Greg and Rachel are more articulate about life than most teens I remember growing up with, but when death is at your door as it is with Rachel, you grow up fast. Still, whenever I see a coming of age film, I often wonder how these kids became so wise. Through a series of visits, Greg and Rachel become friends, but it's not hackneyed or clich\u00e9', overwrought or strained.Seventeen-year-old Greg isn't always a sympathetic character. He whines incessantly and he has the ability to insult others while at the same time being self-eviscerating. His criticism of others hides a dislike of himself. However, he is ultimately a caring teenager who is forced out of his shell by circumstance. His developing relationship interferes with his desire to skirt through school, not be seen and not care for anyone or anything. His relationship with Rachel makes that impossible. Though this all seems like a set up for maudlin production, the film works because of the genuine dialogue and the authenticity of the acting.There are many surrealistic and humorous elements in the movie. Some scenes were especially funny considering that death is a constant presence. The ending brings it all together and doesn't fail to surprise in a logical, heart-felt manner.The music is interesting and not intrusive. The camera work is at times undistinguished and at other times innovative. Molly Shannon, who plays Rachel's mother, is disturbingly entertaining as are the other parents. Jon Bernthal brings humor to the movie in his brief moments on screen as teacher Mr. McCarthy. In total, none of the technical or performance elements of the film bog down this genuinely touching movie.Rating: Pay Full Price This film is for everyone of almost all ages and tastes. And if you enjoy quirky films featuring tough moments in a teenager's life, a film that traipses haltingly from scene to scene, from surreal to hyperrealism, from laughter to tears, this is a must see film for you.Peace, Tex Shelters",

            "content": "There's a lot of charm in Me and Earl and the Dying Girl. It's a story that plays well, and easily connects on an emotional level. Any time you have a young person dealing with a fatal illness it's almost impossible to avoid getting emotionally invested. I definitely welled up with tears once while watching the film, but I can't say I actually shed any tears. I'll get into the reasons why later, but I want to spend a bit more time on the overall pluses and minuses of the film. I think one of the things that I found a bit underwhelming in Me and Earl and the Dying Girl were the first two characters mentioned in the title. Both the male protagonists were a little flat. I was not impressed with Thomas Mann or RJ Cyler, and wanted them to give me more. They are playing the type of characters that I wanted to relate to closely, but I wasn't feeling it. Olivia Cooke and all of the adult cast outshone them in every way, to the point that their bland performance stood out a bit more. I did like the characters' personalities as they were written, though. It also doesn't hurt when a movie like this shows such reverence for classic film.Now let's talk about my biggest problem with Me and Earl and the Dying Girl, but be warned the rest of this review includes some spoilers, and should be avoided by anyone who hasn't seen the film. I can accept a movie with an unreliable narrator. It's an interesting trope that can keep the audience off-balance, and lead to an unexpected conclusion. However, this didn't feel like the type of film that warranted that kind of story-telling device. It was particularly egregious when the narrator flat-out lies to the audience. I presume this was necessary because the title strongly makes it too obvious what will happen, so they just have Greg tell a boldfaced lie to everyone watching in order to attempt a surprise ending. This decision sucked a great deal of the emotion out of the climax and had me more frustrated with the protagonist rather than impacted by what was happening. I think it could be fun to watch the movie without the narration to see how it holds up when you remove the needless hand-holding and pointless lies. I still found some enjoyment from the film as a whole, but it was not as great as I wanted it to be.",

Yes, it will develop and it will end just like you expect it to do after 10 minutes of watching. - In the economy of the movie, Earl could've never existed and it would've been exactly the same. A useless, insignificant character who for some reason is in the title. - At the 30 minutes mark the movie already began to bore me, and it bored me from that point till the end. - The delivery of any emotional content fails miserably. Everything is so fake, shallow, badly written, badly directed. It's not actors' fault.

            "content": "First off, this film is NOT like The Fault in Our Stars. It is NOT a Romantic film and it is NOT about dealing with Cancer; this is a friendship movie about a guy who enjoys films who has trained himself to be as distant and as close to everyone becoming more empathetic and focused, while building a connection with Rachel who is dying of cancer. The lack of a love story may be where the film failed in comparison, but it is still nevertheless emotional.The trio of characters, Greg, Earl and Rachel, all feel like people I'm familiar with. Particularly, I see a lot with Greg, because I am fairly like him and I know people like him, so to see his journey through the film was something that a film like this works well BECAUSE this aspect works well. Earl is the emotional grounding; he centres the film in his and Greg's space, and becomes the voice and reason and social feelings. Rachel is the person who Greg becomes deeply affected with overtime as she goes through Chemotherapy. This film certainly succeeds in making me like the main people. Even when Greg has his meltdown with Rachel not wanting to keep up Chemo, his snapping back never stops making us care for him.Now, the ending. After this movie, I went to see another film, and I went to buy Popcorn, and the person at the till asked me \"what's wrong?\" because I was crying. I just signaled the poster off to my right - this movie - and she said \"Oh, I know, right?\" This ending is truly sad, because in its bittersweetness, you see one story end and another potentially begin. It's the kind of ending that closes everything that we've seen, but opens a potential new one for Greg. The visuals, the voice-over, the music made me sob buckets, and I genuinely can sit through many things without getting emotional. This film is definitely to be considered just for that one aspect of it, so see it, but you WILL cry.",

I adored the visual presentation of the film. In particular the incorporation of stop motion animation to reflect the characters mindstates. Me and Earl and The Dying Girl does a great job of subverting tropes that you see in films such as A Walk to Remember and The Fault in Our Stars. To create something more mature, funnier and ultimately more powerful.The final 20 minutes of the film are phenomenal. This portion is without a doubt the highlight of the film. It's amazing how many emotions are conveyed with little to no dialogue. I really enjoyed the homages to films such as A Clockwork Orange, Harold and Maude, The 400 Blows, Aguirre The Wrath of God and many others. They were all really funny and charming even if you haven't seen the films in question. Though it's an added bonus if you have.I had some problems with this. The film does try a bit too hard to be quirky at points. The last act before the final 20 minutes does drag a bit. I also would've liked if the character of Earl got more development.

It's hard to determine if it's meant to be a teen comedy or a drama. Overall Rating: 4.5 stars Cinematic rating: 4.5 stars Bigger questions rating: 4.5 starsHave you had a cinematic experience that has left you speechless? Packaged as a quirky coming-of-age story, Me and Earl and the Dying Girl surprisingly turns into a magnificent drama with an unexpected depth. In amongst the story of a self- centred teenage boy comes a portrait of loss, love and life. The central character from Jesse Andrews' novel is Greg (Thomas Mann) who lives a shallow high school existence that is independent of meaningful relationships and conflict. His only friend is Earl (RJ Cyler), a childhood friend partners with Greg in avoiding most of the high school trappings and they enjoy making film parodies. They exist throughout their final year of high school without much drama until Greg is asked by his mother to visit Rachel (Olivia Cooke). She is a classmate who has been diagnosed with leukaemia. Greg and Rachael try to make the best of an awkward situation and satisfy their parent's request to connect. Their relationship moves from standoffish to a symbiotic existence. They come to realise they need each other's support and friendship through this traumatic time during their last year of high school. Unlike many John Green novels or John Hughes films, this story has a depth in its multiple and realistic layers of life's trials. One of the overarching elements of the film is Greg and Earl's film making throughout their formative years. Their search for avaunt-garde movies allowed for the development of a list that should be seen by all film students. Like Greg and Earl's list, Alfonso Gomez- Rejon's film should be considered for a must see film of 2015. Me and Earl and the Dying Girl is difficult to classify, because unlike the typical hormonally-charged, coming-of-age films, this story tackles deeper considerations of life and death. With a mix of unconventional humour, Wes Anderson-style visuals and poignant dialogue provide the base for a profound narrative. Mann, Cyler, and Cooke performances allows them to develop their characters in a timely manner. As the storyline unfolds it makes for a depth that moves beyond clich\u00e9 and proves to be endearing. They are brilliantly supported by veteran cast members who expand the breadth of the script and develop a palette of colourful cast members. To support the wealth of acting talent, the stylised cinematography was unsettlingly skillful. The visuals added to the storyline by perfectly depicting the drama portrayed on the screen. The direction of Gomez-Rejon manages to deliver an exquisite, emotionally-charged drama that's only limitation is the thinking that this is a teen-aged, coming-of-age adventure.-A rare cinematic outing like Me and Earl and the Dying Girl engages with the consideration of loss and death, but provides discussion points about life. One of the key queries that comes out is what we choose to do with the gift of life? Jesse Andrew's screenplay of friendship is woven together with a confronting evaluation of life, even life after death. This is brought to a head with a dialogue between Greg and his teacher, Mr. McCarthy, that challenges the teen to understand more about the life we live and the life that is left behind for others to remember. Throughout the darkness of death, this film provides an opportunity to appraise the gift of life. In the end, the story is engaging and entertaining, but produces thoughtful discussion points for a multitude of future conversations. Leaving the cinema... Stunned silence. The audience seemed to be overwhelmed with the journey that they experienced from this film. An emotional roller-coaster that delivers an overwhelming, experiential ride. Well done to Alfonso Gomez-Rejon for providing one of a must see film.Reel Dialogue: What are some of the bigger questions to consider from this film? 1. What does the Bible have to say about death? (John 14:1-3, 2 Corinthians 5: 6-8) 2. Can we find true redemption in this life? (Romans 3:24-26, Ephesians 1:7) 3. Where can we find real love, hope and joy in this broken world?

            "content": "\"I have no idea how to tell this story,\" Greg Gaines (Thomas Mann) Yes, indeed, Me and Earl and the Dying Girl is about a self-conscious teen, Greg, and his budding friendship with a girl, Rachel (Olivia Cooke), just diagnosed with leukemia. Seems like a clich\u00e9d melodrama ready to demand tears. But it's not. It's a smart, sweet coming-of-age story about outsiders who have the creative energy to survive. No maudlin tears, thankfully. Not surprisingly, Sundance Audience and Grand Jury awards came to this film in 2015.Greg and buddy, Earl (RJ Cyler), have made 41 parody movies with titles like A Sockwork Orange and 2:48 PM Cowboy. This eccentricity alone wins my heart, but add to that their care of dying classmate Rachel, with words and ideas as off the wall as they are, and all of it balm for her. The ingenious language is funny and poignant while she enjoys the boys and almost forgets she may be on her way out. It's a long way from Risky Business in 1983 but not so long if you see that freedom is what teens want.Greg's seemingly non-chalant attitude doesn't for too long disguise a warm heart and is a revelation to us about how to survive intense high school years. Yet, peers aren't the only ones to be reckoned with because parents can be predatory, weird, demanding, or just simply out of it. Greg handles them with an insouciance to be admired.Although Greg and Rachel get closer as friends, she is losing her will to fight. That Greg resents her withdrawal is one of the signs he is maturing while finding reasons to live an active life. Me and Earl may remind you of Juno or The Fault in Our Stars, and somewhat the documentary, The Wolfpack, where the Angulo siblings survive familial imprisonment in a Manhattan apartment by recreating scenes from movies like Reservoir Dogs. These teens find solace in their world of movies. I have no complaint.Through most of this engaging film, it's never clear if Rachel will make it. That's not the point, anyway. Surviving with imagination and engaging with others becomes the mantra for happiness regardless of whether or not death is at the door.",

I also like Olivia Cooke from her role in the TV series \"Bates Motel.\" But I should have seen the negative signs: the film received good, but not great critical reviews, and the film had no legs, topping out at $6 million at the box office.The movie is pretentious, self-referential, self-indulgent, and tries to be oh-so-clever. Thomas Mann in the male lead of Greg is awful. It reminded me a little bit of Juno, with high school kids spouting things and doing things that high school kids just don't do.I know this movie has been compared to \"The Fault in Our Stars,\" due to the common theme. I wasn't a big fan of \"The Fault in our Stars\"...I thought it was just OK. But compared to \"Me, Earl and the Dying Girl,\" \"The Fault in Our Stars\" is \"Citizen Kane.\"",

For starters, this film is strange. It is not for those with simple- minded movie tastes. Throughout the movie, you will ask yourself what it is that you are seeing. You will even feel like there are unexplained plot holes all of the way up until the end. The ending is not the one you are expecting. You will receive a new level understanding that is not explained throughout the movie but can only be understood through watching the rest of the film. The ending will frustrate you but through some personal reflection, its meaning can be interpreted. All that I can say without spoiling it is that you need to look beyond what you see.

On the plus side, I am glad I saw this (the same cannot be said for my partner watching the film who fell asleep), as it had a lot of good things going on. The cinematography was superb, and the overall visual effect made this enjoyable to watch (camera angles, colours, imagery, long shots etc.). The 'dying girl' in question was well played and anchored the film appropriately. Some of the interplay between the characters was also quite smooth and funny with some quirky individuals present.It is also the interplay with the characters that lets this film down in some ways. Earl is underdeveloped though interesting, and many of the characters are quirky but ridiculous in the process making the fabric of the film thin in the process. There is a very distinct lack of music and talking through much of the film, which is clearly intentional to allow the scenes to breathe and bring you in to them. It does do that but in a self conscious way, which left me with the impression that it was trying too hard to be beautiful and emotional but without quite having the freedom to work properly.It would be fair to say this film was clever, funny, and sad. However, it was clever but slightly smug, funny but did not make me laugh, and was sad but did not make me cry.",

Which I know you should judge a movie on its own merits...but its kind of hard when the characterizations seemed so off. First of all Greg is awkward sure, but he's not mean. And this version came across a lot meaner. Like, he never says that his mom is making him spend time with her (even though its true) cause he knows that would hurt her feelings, or the cafeteria scene he makes up silly story/joke about how his food is alien barf and how another student is an alien but its super obvious that its clearly joke...he doesnt randomly make fun of another student's walk. There was just little things like those that rubbed me the wrong way. I also felt that Molly Shannon was woefully miscast. She plays it so weirdly like shes trying to come on to these teenagers. Even the scene where she's being interviewed for Greg and Earl's movie is being played for laughs when its meant to be serious. And I feel like the movie missed the point of the book. The book clearly states from the beginning that this isnt some typical sappy story where its going to shed you some insight on how her cancer changed his life...blah blah blah. But the movie sure wanted to go that way.Like, its not a terrible film....just not what I was expecting. I was fine with them cutting out certain aspects of the book/condensing or adding stuff in like the prom. I mean whatever, that are small insignificant things that dont overall change the story. I just feel about 20 min, the movie started to really change direction. Not too mention that some parts feel rushed.Overall, I did like the actors in this (minus Molly Shannon), and I really liked the addition of the stop motion and seeing the fake movies. And there are funny, cute, and some heartwarming moments.I liked it, but didnt love it.",

Greg's parents (Nick Offerman, Connie Britton) force him to befriend their friend Denise (Molly Shannon)'s daughter Rachel (Olivia Cooke) who is dying of leukemia.This is a deliberately low-key quirky teen melodrama. At times, I wish this could be more quote unquote real. I still love the nice lead characters despite Greg's self-pitying narcissism. For a movie with a dying girl, the stakes are never really too high. Olivia Cooke is so adorably cute that she never really achieves sickly. Greg is always claiming this is not the normal teen melodrama which does make it too self-aware. The same goes for his claim that nobody dies. It's a bit too written. It's a bit too manufactured. One can see the typing on the keyboard on the screen or the print on the page. It's still a nice lovely quirky coming-of-age movie.On a minor note, I would make Rachel's movie about something. Maybe I would have a video of the cafeteria to see the students come and go. It would be difficult to make any dialog in the video compelling enough.

I can certainly fire off a number of films that I consider to be 'important' but that would just be me talking about those films in a wanky, critical context. But the real question itself is a deeply personal one and it's fair to say that my response can alter according to the mood I'm in and the person I'm conversing with.However, there are some films that I can watch from a critical lens and still be affected in a most personal manner. Me and Earl and the Dying Girl is such a film. Which is precisely why I absolutely love it.Consider this, a socially awkward teenager is asked by his interfering mother to make friends with a fellow student who is diagnosed with leukaemia. The teenagers eventually find a way to make this work through the amateurish and ridiculously funny short films that the lead character Greg and his associate Earl produce, direct and star in. These films are more like crazy tributes to classic and arty foreign films. There's really not much more to the story, but as always, to me a story is of no real consequence. What's important is what and how I feel when the end credits roll. At times, when I was watching the film (during my flight home), the cabin crew were laughing at me laughing out loud at some of the many hysterically funny scenes, but at the end I was moved to tears. And no, I will not spoil it for you and I assure you, the end is not what you think it is going to be. But if you are not affected by the last 15 minutes of the film, you're probably missing an important piece of your heart. I was caught completely off guard. The final images, with visual clues scattered during the course of the film satisfied my intellectual need to analyse the moving pictures and the music by Brian Eno seriously took me to a strange and different place. This is a wonderful, intelligent, warm spirited but most of all a beautifully sensitive film. The three very likable lead actors were perfectly cast and Olivia Cooke is Rose Byrne's doppelg\u00e4nger. Just gorgeous. I can't tell you just how much I love this film, it certainly ranks as one of my favourites of the year. An absolute must see, especially for classic film buffs.",

            "content": "WARNING..... Go and grab those tissue boxes because no doubt you are going to need them as this film will reduce you to tears, more than once, but i definitely didn't cry.....Me and Earl and the Dying Girl is a coming of age indie film and is an adaptation of the book of the same name. Essentially it is a story about Greg, who sparks an unlikely friendship with a girl who has just been diagnosed with cancer and you get to watch their friendship and how it develops and how it affects them throughout the course of the film. It is an extremely emotionally powerful film that really gets you to understand everything these characters are going through and how the impact of something like cancer can greatly affect yourself and the people around you. The film did an astounding job at making these characters incredibly real, you believe these are real people and that you are watching a documentary on their lives because it does a fantastic job at making them relatable and vulnerable to emotion. The film is really driven by emotions, and how you actually experience sections of the film is directly related to how some of the characters are feeling. So you have many moments that are lighter and more fun and then you have some more deeper depressing scenes that will undoubtedly hit you right in the feels. And it is a very interesting progression as the film continues and the overall tone changes in the film that it can send you on this emotional roller-coaster.As i just mentioned, there were tonnes of well balanced tonal shifts throughout the film where it was able to make you laugh at some of Greg's awkwardness and then hit you with some real emotional stuff. It did very well at controlling the more light-hearted funny moments with some more heavy moments and you get the full experience of these scenes the whole time. The incredibly emotional story told is only enhanced by the absolutely amazing cinematography and musical score and seeing them work together in this film is on its own so fascinating. Watching as the long, slowly panning shots are accompanied by some some amazingly well crafted scores was just beautiful, even if literally nothing was happening on-screen it still had my full attention. But the emotional strength of the film would not have come through as strongly if it was with any other cast imaginable, because i believe this was pretty much perfect casting. Thomas Mann, Olivia Cooke, and R.J Cyler were astounding at capturing the emotions and relationships of these characters to the point where when i see those actors in other films i will think of these roles because they were so powerful. Even some of the supporting cast were very strong choices and put in great performances to enhance those three main roles. We also do get a little hilarious cameo from one of Australia's own, it's quick but was a really good laugh.In the end, i cannot recommend this film enough, if coming of age, emotional dramas are your thing then you will love this. If that is not your type of film then of-course this isn't going to change your mind. But it really is funny, emotionally powerful and just a well crafted, well directed film. - 8.7",

Gradually, a friendship grows between them, and Greg's one actual friend, streetwise black teen Earl, becomes part of the small circle when he lets on to Rachel (to Greg's embarrassment) that he and Greg have been making home movies which spoof classic films: working her way through their library provides Rachel with entertainment.Teenagers with cancer isn't an obvious topic for crowd=pleasing movies, but The Fault In Our Stars did well enough last year, and Me and Earl (excuse me for shortening the ear-catching but ungainly title) deserves to follow it. Let me say at the start that, while this film is unquestionably about love \u2013 there is no doubt that the individuals in this friendship end up loving each other \u2013 it is not about teen romance in the slightest. Neither is it about mawkish sentiment \u2013 it is actually quite hard nosed. It is also often quite funny, although it would be inaccurate to call it a comedy: there is far more drama in it than humour.And it is blessed with good performances. Greg and Rachel and Earl are all very well played (Thomas Mann, Olivia Cooke, and RJ Cyler respectively), but I felt the best performance was from Molly Shannon as Rachel's mother Denise. Never seen without a wine glass in her hand, it is a funny, brittle performance as a mother who wants to just be a mother but can't cope with what is happening to her daughter. There is also a standout scene between Greg and Rachel where they have an argument, much of which consists of silence because neither of them know what to say. Director Alfonso Gomez-Rejon fills the movie with a lot of nice directorial touches, including an unexpected guest cameo voice.If I had a criticism, it would be that Earl being black felt shoehorned in: it felt that, instead of Greg having a friend from a similar background, which would have been natural, he had Earl Because Black. The story had enough going for it without tokenism being necessary.Even so, I enjoyed this film much more than I expected to.",

The movie parodies produced by Greg and Earl are less approachable nostalgic references for a wider audience than film geek inside baseball for a more specific crowd. Between the long spates of movie lore, Greg's monologue-ing about the densely layered high school class structure and The Dying Girl's swooning, the movie is fairly dull. In short, much of the critical praise comes from movie geeks complimenting a movie geek movie and from a twist ending that gives a French film melancholia to the processings.",

It is as if they are declaring, 'I 'know the conversation so well that I can quote it but I m too cool and clever to do something this straight forward. So I m doing this instead.' None of the characters and their emotions here ring true as they are too busy to out-quirky each other in their outfits, out of left field dialogues and odd balled behaviour. Why? Because the filmmakers are cool. That's why. Just shut up and admire our stop motion Shorts.

You can't fault the movie for its originality and emotional concept but the fact that the movie is based around Greg (Thomas Mann), who seems to be annoyed with the whole world, while the poor girl Rachel (Olivia Cooke) is suffering with cancer, got under my skin. Earl (RJ Cyler), was totally right for being annoyed with his best friend, because he was concentrating on trivia matters, when he really needed to be there for Rachel who was going through a really rough time. With that aside, the acting is great from the teenagers, especially Rachel who went on a downhill spiral once she started the treatment for the disease, and I liked Mr. McCarthy, played by Jon Berthal, and Rachels mum, Denise (Molly Shannon). What also got under my skin is the fact that Greg had been forced by his mum, (Connie Britton), to be friends with Rachel, just because she was ill but it was sweet, watching them build a relationship under extreme circumstances. Earl is very real with Rachel, from the very beginning but it's Greg who devotes most of his with Rachel, which eventually takes its toll when it comes to his coursework. That's what makes the ending so emotional, because Greg finally realises that he should have been more of a friend to Rachel except for being there just to please his mum, and the time that be spent making the film with Earl, should have been spent with her. Anyway, I did enjoy the movie, from a certain point of view but Greg got way too much airtime. Watchable!Round-Up: After the first few minutes of this film, I thought it was going to be a another one of those typical \"American teenager at school\" type movies, which I'm getting a bit fed up with now but once Rachel comes onto the scene, the whole tone and witty script kicks in and it becomes, somewhat, enjoyable, for a while. You might have recognised Thomas Mann, 24, from the funny, It's Kind Of A Funny Story, Project X, Fun Size, Hansel & Gretel, Beautiful Creatures, As Cool As I Am, Welcome To Me, The Stanford Prison Experiment, The Preppie Connection, Outliving Emily and Memoria but to be totally honest with you, I don't recognise him. There's nothing that really stood out with his performance in this movie but I hope that RJ Cyler gets a career boost after his great performance. The film was directed by Alfonso Gomez-Rejon, whose mainly directed TV series like Glee, the Carrie Diaries and American Horror Story. He did direct one movie called The Town That Dreaded Sundown, which didn't really earn him much credit but this movie has brought him into the spotlight because of his unique directing techniques and his original story telling methods. Personally, I was hoping for a different outcome with this film but it's still watchable and entertaining, in its own way.Budget: $8million Worldwide Gross: $9millionI recommend this movie to people who are into their drama/comedies starring Thomas Mann, RJ Cyler, Olivia Cooke, Molly Shannon, Nick Offerman, Connie Britton and Jon Bernthal. 5/10",

There is hardly any plot and hardly any story line. Worst of all and for me the reason to actually turn the movie finally off after about an hour is that it is just another Apple commercial. There is more or less not a single scene in the film without an Apple product being shown. Not on the side but rather in center of the screen into the viewers face.

It knew when to just let us sit in silence with the characters and and when to let the music/dialog lead the scene. There were points that could've been written better and the score wasn't very prominent, but the points where it hit hard really shone through. This is a growing up story just as much as it is a comedy and a tragedy.I'm not sure how to rate this film. As a whole story, I think it's a 7.8/10 but there are times where it doesn't deserve more than a 2/10 and times where 10/10 is absolutely deserved.

This is the most disgusting, epic ode to White People Problems I've seen since The Blind Side, overweening with entitlement and privilege \u2013 so much that at one point I looked to my right and a distinguished colleague was actually holding up his middle finger at the screen. Me And Earl And The Dying Girl is foul \u2013 the most rancid, filthy racist movie I've seen in years.And I'm here today to tell you why.Young actor Thomas Mann (not the Death In Venice guy) stars as Greg Gaines, a self-obsessed teenage butthole who spends most of his time with his nose buried in the Criterion Collection. He and his \"co-worker\" Earl (RJ Cutler) waste way too many days coming up with one-liner parody films, a la \"A Sockwork Orange\" (Kubrick's movie done with sock puppets) or \"4:32 PM Cowboy\" \u2013 as they're seventeen year old cineastes with the tastes of the forty-year-old men making this picture, and that goes double for all the old Brian Eno songs on the soundtrack.None of this is convincing for a second, but crotchety middle-aged critics seem to be raving, so what do we know? We only see five-second glimpses of Greg & Earl's movies, but why didn't they just make them Vines instead of asking us to believe these kids shot entire DVDs out of their one-joke gags? One day Greg's horrible mom (Connie Britton, who is much better than this) forces him to hang out with a neighbor chick suffering from leukemia. Olivia Cooke's Rachel is a tough broad who can see right through him, then she spends the rest of the movie telling Greg how wonderful he is \u2013despite all evidence to the contrary.Greg struts around with his total freaking imbecile friend Earl nodding inanely behind him, the idiot colored-fellow folding his arms and nodding: \"Hell yeah, dem dying girl titties. Have you sucked on dem titties yet?\" \"DEM TITTIES, DEM TITTIES, DEM TITTIES. (How the Christ did this movie even get made in the year 2015?) DEM TITTIES, DEM TITTIES, DEM TITTIES.\" Earl sure likes Dem Titties.As for the Dying Girl, she's basically an afterthought \u2013 a prop spending the last weeks of her life making sure that Greg gets into college. Glad she finally found a noble cause.I hate this movie for so many reasons. I want to set every copy of it on fire and soil on the ashes. I hate how it is designed to enoble the solipsistic psychopathy of teenage know-it-alls. I am reminded of Roger Ebert's line about how fans of Transformers movies are \"not sufficiently evolved yet.\" I look at people raving about this despicable film from Sundance where I saw at least half a dozen movies that opened my eyes and made me feel how another world moved. But instead those folks give awards to this racist, twee (500) Days Of Juno BS. Viewers went nuts for this hunk of nonsense because of \"all the feels\" or whatever zinger millennials now use to completely abdicate themselves from responsibility for what they watch.I don't normally like to cast aspersions on people over differences of opinion, but this one's engineered to suck up so hard at easy-lay critics that I swear you little boys can do better. Try harder. Please. The dying girl deserves more than you.",

            "content": "(Rating: \u2606\u2606\u2606 out of 4) This film is recommended.In brief: Death becomes her in this thought-provoking and creative film.GRADE: BMe and Earl and the Dying Girl is the flip side of The Fault is Our Stars. It follows the same premise, a young girl dying of cancer, but outdistances itself from the sappy and maudlin moments with a edgy and wry sense of humor and some imaginative filmmaking from director Alfonzo Gomez-Rejon in his second feature film. He perfectly captures teenage life with all its non-conformity angst and peer pressure and he cleverly mixes animation and live action to help tell his story of young love. \ufffcThe director is aided by newcomer Jesse Andrews who adapted the screenplay from his own YA novel. The dialogue is authentic and the film has a lovely quality of the real and the surreal. These well defined characters are far from the caricatures usually seen in today's teenage romantic comedies. The film tells its tale of a trio of friends; Greg (Thomas Mann). the Me in our story, Earl (RJ Cyler) and the dying girl, Rachel (Olivia Cooke). A begrudging Greg, on the urging of his parents, befriends Rachel, who has just be diagnosed with leukemia. Their camaraderie is the crux of the film that explores friendship and love in the subtlest of ways. \ufffcEarl, Greg's best bud and partner in amateur film-making, becomes part of this relationship with his support and comic asides. The film's adult characters are not the usual dullards but interesting if dysfunctional people. Unfortunately they fade into the background when more screen time with them would have only enhanced the story. Nick Offerman and Connie Britton play Greg's parents and Molly Shannon is Rachel's drunken mother, all doing fine work here.\ufffcBut it is the three young actors who excel in their roles. RJ Cyler blends the cynical and vulnerable aspects into his character. Olivia Cooke keeps Rachel grounded in reality and never allows her character to exhibit any false move or wasteful overacting to convey her dilemma. Most effective is Mr. Mann, who skillfully handles Greg's mood swings and aloofness with nuance and clarity. As Greg, he has developed one of the most believable teenagers on film to date. His emotional meltdown scene adeptly conveys the anger, frustration, and sadness that adolescents can feel in today's world. It is a remarkable performance by a talented performer that has a promising career in store. \ufffcThe film utilizes Earl and Greg's independent film parodies to send-up other classic films with some witty and clever results. However, these small comic gems do little to advance the story and some of the characters' actions seem over-scripted at times. There are also some plot contrivances with several minor characters having far too many quirks in which no one in this world seems normal. Plus the film's format of labeling the days in this relationship of doomed friends was a tad too similar in its approach to another wonderful independent film, (500) Days of Summer, which successfully mixed the bittersweet with the sweetest of times as well.That said, Me and Earl and the Dying Girl is innovative and touching. This film has become an indie favorite among critics and rightfully so. It is well worth your attention too.Visit my blog at: www.dearmoviegoer.comANY COMMENTS: Please contact me at: jadepietro@rcn.com",

            "content": "Greg is an introvert who had carefully planned his high school years existence to be a total no one, avoiding to have any enemy. Coming from a quirky family, he has only one friend, Earl, who he recognizes as his coworker, working in their secret projects of parodies of classic movies. One day His mother forces Greg to visit Rachel, his classmate who's diagnosed having leukemia. After the first visit, Greg soon actually becomes friends with Rachel. They start to hang out together and their school friends start to think they're together. One day Greg and Earl have lunch in their usual place, the room of the history teacher Mr. McCarthy. They somehow get high after eating the teacher's soup. They go to Rachel's after school and Greg introduces Earl to Rachel. Earl reveals he and Greg have been making movies since they're little, although Greg thinks the movies are their secret. They show Rachel one of their works and she likes it. The next day Greg accidentally makes enemies out of Scott Mayhue and Ill Phil due to the incident when they get high after the soup. Meanwhile Rachel starts her treatment and loses her hair. Greg brings more of his and Earl's movies to cheer her up. One day, Madison, one of their friends visits Greg and Earl with the suggestion that they make a movie for Rachel. Greg and Rachel share about college. He tells her he is reluctant to apply but she encourages him and helps him write his personal essay. This lands Greg an early acceptance into college. Greg decides to go make a movie for Rachel. But he and Earl just can't find the right thing to do for it. Greg even abandons his school work for the movie and visiting Rachel.Bt Rachel decides to stop treatment since it only makes her more sick. Greg and her argue about encouragements they give each other and that Rachel is quitting. Rachek also reveals Earl has told her about the movie he and Greg is making for her. These make Greg angry to Rachel and Earl. Greg meets Mr. McCarthy and the teacher tells him that we can learn about people even after they die. Greg reveals to his mom about his abandoned school work and the change about the early acceptance. Rachel gets worse but Greg refuses to visit her in the hospital. Ill Phil comes to Greg at school to have his revenge. They fight but Earl moves in and defends Greg. Madison feels guilty about Greg's situation caused by the movie so she offers to be his prom date. Before going to the prom Greg visits Rachel with the finished movie for her. Rachel is already so worse that she isn't able to speak. She gets even worse while watching the movie and dies soon after. After the funeral Greg visits Rachel's room and finds out about her hobby of cutting out books into artworks. He finds a letter from her to him. In it she writes about her writing to the college admission defending him for his school work decline over making her a movie.I see the story as a tricky one initially for the fillmmakers to execute. Having a loss as one of the main focus in the story and the fact that the story itself is based on a novel, the script would present some challenges in how to make it work. Furthermore there is the addition of the occasional humor amidst the heavy set of dramas between many people in Greg's life. But actually the filmmakers did it well enough that the movie nicely encompasses all those elements.The trick the movie used was to partition the story elements and put a pull some a certain string to deter predictability. I haven't had the pleasure of reading the novel but I guess the movie must have followed some similar manner in executing the story partitioning. The movie nicely explores on the quirky life of Greg on the first half; his quirky parents, his past and works with Earl and Earl himself. In between the two parts the movie nicely inserts some seeds of problems besides Rachel's illness; the thing with Mr. McCarthy, Greg's friends and even with Earl.On the second half the movie emphasizes more on the culmination of all the seeds of problems. We Rachel gets worse as the same time as Greg's friends, even Earl, gets to his nerves. The movie prudently diminished any humor on the most of its second half. Instead the filmmakers did more than enough in emphasizing the anxiety Greg feels among his sadness using the music scoring, and specifically the lighting on the scene at Rachel's hospital bed.The acting overall feels decently nice. Thomas Mann did his parts well enough that we get to really be in Greg's shoes all the way through the movie. Olivia Cooke also did well acting out Rachel's emotions. I really liked how she can take a break for her usual Horror or Sci-Fi gigs and really work on her acting seriously. RJ Cyler did nicely in adding the ghetto spice up to the whole movie and making it more alive.A 7 out of 10 score I give to Me and Earl and The Dying Girl (2015). A recommendation goes only for you who look for a relaxed movie that can also make you laugh and touch your feelings at the same time.",

            "content": "It's rare that I fall in love with a film so much that I watch it twice in a row. Then a third time the following week. I knew while watching Me and Earl and The Dying Girl the first time that I had to watch it again as soon as possible. So I did the next morning. It's an anti-romance with the platonic relationship between \"Me\" and the \"Dying Girl,\" but their chemistry and compassion sparks a delightful giddiness that's utterly life-affirming. It's perfectly paired with director Alfonso Gomez-Rejon inventive cinematic shorthand. It's a film that felt deeply personal and tailored for me from the moment Rejon put a couple seconds of a certain shot in Taxi Driver so that I immediately understood what he wanted to communicate in his scene. It's soaked in a pure love of cinema.As Rejon begs, borrows and steals from all the best corners of film, its Wes Anderson whose spirit runs deepest in its corridors. Produced by Anderson's production company Indian Paintbrush, it's no surprise, and the material is all the better for it. Of course, Anderson is particularly inspired by other filmmakers, so Me and Earl runs like a condensed version - and frankly better edited than Anderson's work. Borrowing tilts, pans, wide lenses, rocking zooms, long takes, axial cuts, quick closeups, contemporary soundtrack and even a touch of stop motion and annotations, it's essential lower-rent Anderson. However, while that may be too derisive for many, Anderson is my favourite contemporary filmmaker and I eat up anything he does. This is thoroughly welcome in my book with Rejon's intelligent senses of space and motion.More John Hughes than Rushmore, it does suffer from clich\u00e9s that it deliberately brings to the table. It wants to be a self-aware deconstruction of the tropes, but it only half works. Side characters of high school students in obvious cliques are caricatures. This problem does seep into close quarters as its titular Earl, a hilarious deadpan RJ Cyler, is operating on a single contradiction. He's the least likely candidate to be a film buff, let alone a willing participant. But that's just the gag. He does move the plot along where the \"Me\"s Greg doesn't want it to go. The film, especially its first half, is heightened through the clouded perspective of Greg. Absorbed into the depths of cinema, he escapes reality which is reflected in this fantastical way he sees the world. He may be self-deprecating on the outset, but he's unaware how his ego shines brighter.Nevertheless, Greg is a very relatable character. Film rarely touches on the idea of poor foresight in a way that truly resonates. As Greg allows opportunities to fly by, it recalls anything I refrained from grasping. That said, it's refreshing to see him desire to be a neutral outcast, as that was the bane of my high school existence. Thomas Mann, who I saw for the first time as a resistant volunteer in the last chunk of The Stanford Prison Experiment, impresses in a leading role that's full of reluctant personality. His dry comic timing endures my three viewings and he slowly peels off that shell with detail. However it's Olivia Cooke, the aforementioned \"Dying Girl\" Rachel, who emerges as the film's standout. She adds a stark dose of grave reality with ease, balancing the lightness of her endearing character with the bleakness of her impending mortality due to terminal cancer.Full of youthful energy in the film's style, it's about the potential we have and how that can be wasted, through a lack of motivation and, of course, death. It's deep-rooted in a universal fear of change despite our perpetual limited existences. While Greg is initially reluctant to share his films, there's a wonderful warmth in how he eventually makes them for an audience of one with Rachel, and then becomes her favourite past-time. With its annotation of describing their friendship as \"doomed\" it's counting down the minutes until it broke my heart. Cinema is simultaneously a way to process reality and also to escape it - as demonstrated by the stoic way Greg and Earl watch their own work, when not interrupted by Nick Offerman, who's a reliable riot. As someone who watches and loves it as much as Greg, and the way grim reality seeps into the style of the film in the second half, this idea touched a bittersweet nerve. It also wants to bring up the idea that despite mishandling potential, life doesn't end at death, and we dig up and discover facts about people all the time. The film struggles to reign in all its themes and existential ideas, which is part of the reason I watched it so many times besides its sublime construction, to decipher exactly what it wants to say. No clear cut answers have been interpreted, but I'll keep trying no doubt. The Brian Eno score will never grow old, especially with flourishes of Ennio Morrione-esque and Mark Mothersbagh style music thrown in for good measure - along with perhaps my new favourite usage of my favourite song, Lou Reed's \"Street Hassle.\" Me and Earl and the Dying Girl earns all of its laughs and tears and although it has many cracks that I would have liked to see fill in - such as more on Greg and Rachel's elusive past - it does justice to its inspirations. A very promising letter to film's future and a love letter to its past.9/10",

            "content": "The \"Me\" in Me and Earl and the Dying Girl defines hero Greg as the object of his life, not the assertive willful subject \u2014 which would be \"I.\" A self-absorbed teenager, he survives high school by making himself invisible, casually connecting with each of the various groups at his school but remaining insecure, self-deprecatory, unassertive. The film itself is his final act of self-assertion. He tells the story of himself, the dying Rachel and his longtime friend Earl as his attempt to explain his drop in grades, hoping to revive his admission into university. Rachel is Jewish, Earl African-American and Greg whitebread bland \u2014 so even there he remains invisible while touching upon more vivid subcultures. Greg is so wary of friendship and commitment he introduces Earl as \"co- worker\" not friend.Greg and Earl have been making modest parodies of classic films (e.g., 2:48 pm Cowboy, Vere'd He Go?, The Turd Man), another way to brush up against established character without revealing yourself. Greg is ironic about everything, as teens tend, because he lacks confidence, has no clear sense of himself, is puzzled by the mysteries of life and fears growing up. His stop-action animation clips are another form of imitating life without living it, another form of arrested development.At first reluctant to engage with the lukemia-stricken Rachel, Greg slips into a very warm and rewarding relationship with her \u2014 to the point of wasting his term at school. He withdraws angrily when she ceases her chemo, because he can't accept dying. Supposedly to ease our minds, he twice tells us she won't die, but that's a replay of his denial. His history teacher provides the key lesson: Even when someone dies you can keep learning about them. That is, our dear ones stay alive in our memories and in our feelings. The teacher knows that in two ways: (i) from his experience after his father's death; (ii) he's a history teacher so he knows to learn new lessons from the past.In contrast, Greg's father is a sociology professor: someone focused on the social structures of the present. He's tenured, which means he spends all his time at home, in his robe, grizzled, nibbling weird snacks he has made, obsessed with foreign films. That film link defines both Greg's connection to his eccentric father and his extreme detachment. After Rachel's death Greg makes surprising discoveries about her. She returned his emotional connection, while slightly less reticent. More dramatically, the books he so cursorily noted on his first visit turn out to be sculptures she made, 3-D carvings into the pages with small figures sometimes glued in. They're the equivalent of his little films in their creativity, miniaturizing real life and compulsive but ironic self-expression. Because Greg found himself caring for Rachel she stays alive in his broadening consciousness. Her death leaves her a richly intense open book, not a sealed fate. So this brilliant, touching romantic comedy is really about the meaning of death \u2014 which is the meaning of life and the function of human engagement.The minor characters support the theme of Rachel's unfolding enigma. Both her and Greg's mothers are strong, odd characters that their friends may only come to understand after they have passed. So too the two teachers, the eccentric sociologist who seems to live in suspended animation (aka \"tenure\") and the macho high school history teacher with his tattoos, equally curious cuisine and tradition of letting students watch foreign films in his office at lunchtime. A rich diet of foreign foods and foreign films make the two rather different teachers enigmatically connected. Like Rachel \u2014 and as Earl and Greg will have \u2014 when they finally pass their dear ones will have interesting backstories to unfold.",

            "content": "\"What greater thing is there for two human souls than to feel that they are joined... to strengthen each other... to be at one with each other in silent unspeakable memories\" \u2013 George Eliot Winner of the Grand Jury Prize and Audience Award at the 2015 Sundance Film Festival, Alfonso Gomez-Rejon's (\"The Town that Dreaded Sundown\") coming-of-age comedy/drama, Me and Earl and the Dying Girl, is both very funny and very sad, full of life's pain but also reminding us of its joy. Based on a novel by Jesse Andrews who also wrote the screenplay, it is a sweet, smartly written film that always retains a human quality that we can relate to. Though its story of teenage alienation and terminal illness may sound like a dozen other genre films, its appealing freshness and rejection of maudlin sentimentality sets it apart from the rest.Greg, (Thomas Mann, \"Project X\"), who narrates the film, is a shy high school student with a shaky self-image. Self-absorbed and preferring not to be noticed, he remains aloof while separating people into groups and cliques, not antagonistic to any, just personally uninvolved. Perhaps too stereotypically from the poorer side of town, his best friend Earl (RJ Cyler, \"Second Chances\") is an African-American boy he has known since kindergarten but who he introduces to others as his \"co-worker,\" the word \"friend\" having too many connotations for Greg who is afraid of being rejected by those close to him. His fear of intimacy may be a product of his relationship with his overbearing parents, mom (Connie Britton, \"This is Where I Leave You\") and dad (Nick Offerman, \"Danny Collins\").Dad is a well-traveled Sociology professor with a predilection for exotic foods which his family are forced to share and a love of foreign and classic films. Instead of watching Disney and other animated films as children, Greg and Earl have grown up watching such films as \"Breathless,\" \"Tales of Hoffman,\" and Herzog's \"Burden of Dreams\"(Greg's imitation of Werner Herzog is one of the funniest bits in the film). The two have made over forty films together, parodying famous films using funny titles such as \"2:48 P.M. Cowboy,\" \"Pooping Tom,\" \"A Sockwork Orange,\" \"Monorash,\" and \"Senior Citizen Cane.\" The centerpiece of the film, however, is Greg's relationship with Rachel Kushner (Olivia Cooke, \"Ouija\"), a fellow student who has been diagnosed with leukemia. Pigeonholed by Greg as belonging to the Upper-Middle Class Jewish Senior Girl Sub-Clique 2A, their friendship begins on a rocky note when he admits that he is not hanging out with her out of pity but because his mom forced him into it. A deep bond is forged, however, and their relationship unfolds naturally with humor and affection in spite of its unpleasant beginning and the possibility of its sudden end.Though not portrayed in an overtly physical way, their friendship is one that is truly caring in spite of the emotional and physical toll of Rachel's chemotherapy, something I'm familiar with since my wife has been going through it. Earl also provides some relief by sharing some of their films with her which, at least temporarily, keeps her mind away from her illness. Two supporting roles deserve mention. Molly Shannon (\"Life after Beth\") is appealing though a bit over-the top as Rachel's mom Denise, while Joe Bernthal (\"Fury\") is perfect as Mr. McCarthy, a history teacher who allows Greg and Earl to escape the insanity of the school lunchroom and use his office to watch movies and talk about life.In a very moving sequence, McCarthy shares his personal experience of losing someone close, a story that Gomez-Rejon eventually uses to great advantage. Shot by cinematographer Chung Chung-hoon (Oldboy, Sympathy for Lady Vengeance), on a quirkiness scale of one to ten, Me and Earl and the Dying Girl registers a high eight with a lot of Wes Anderson-type features such as sight gags, amusing intertitles,\" animated sequences, and innovative camera-work, but on the scale that measures honesty and sincerity in films, it is off the charts. Probing deeper than most films of its kind, it forges genuine, three-dimensional characters who will make their way into your heart and never leave.",

Yes, there is a dying girl here, statements made throughout the picture to the contrary, as if setting up the denouement is intended to take some of the edge off things. Earl is Greg's best bud, but they don't act like it much until the friendship is tested by the unraveling of events. In a way, it's a teenage coming of age story without the emphasis on sex, refreshing actually because it explores deeper matters of life and death in a way that isn't too heavy handed. You'll probably want to keep a spare hankie around for the end of the story, which does find a way to be uplifting despite the tragic consequences of Rachel's (Olivia Cooke) illness. Quirky would be one way to describe the picture, but that word gets used a bit much. Let's just say that for it's subject matter, you'll come away with an appreciation for the simple things that bring people together in hope and friendship.",

This film actually gives a pretty good tour of the city, as the old Schenley High School, The Warhol, Copacetic Comics and Oakland all show up.I first watched this because it was directed by Alfonso Gomez-Rejon, who did such a phenomenal job on the reimagined The Town That Dreaded Sundown.Greg's parents - Nick Offerman and Connie Britton - force him to spend time with Rachel, who is suffering from leukemia and not attending school. As she grows sicker and loses her hair, Greg assures us that she does not die in the end. To keep her spirits up, he shares the film parodies that he creates with his co-worker - he is afraid to say friend about anyone - Earl.Greg begins to neglect school - and even a popular girl named Madison (Katherine C. Hughes) as he struggles to stay positive as Rachel gets worse. He even loses his friendship with his collaborator as they finish making a movie to try and help her spirits.I can't think about this movie without tearing up Gomez-Rejon made it in the attempt to create a more personal movie and deal with the loss of his father. It really says something about growing up and the people we gain and lose as we stumble through life. I recommend it highly.",

            "content": "The story sounded like one that would be both funny and sad, and the plot involved teenagers that make their own spoofs of famous films, so I was more than up for that, directed by Alfonso Gomez-Rejon (The Current War). Basically, seventeen-year-old Greg Gaines (Thomas Mann) is a senior at Pittsburgh's Schenley High School who avoids close engagement with other students. His mother (Connie Britton) tells him that fellow student and his former childhood friend Rachel Kushner (Olivia Cooke) has been diagnosed with leukemia. He is forced by his mother and father (Nick Offerman) to befriend and spend time with her. Greg and Rachel have an awkward first encounter, with neither of them truly wanting the other's company. Greg manages to strike up a conversation about her pillow collection. Rachel comes to find his quirky personality and honesty endearing. Greg introduces Rachel to his \"coworker\" Earl (RJ Cyler) (Greg avoids calling people his friend, fearing they won't reciprocate). Greg and Earl have made numerous short films parodying famous film titles. Despite Greg's reluctance, Earl shares their collection with her, which she finds entertaining. As Rachel begins her chemotherapy treatment and subsequently loses her hair, Greg begins spending less time on schoolwork and more time caring for her and entertaining her to lift her spirits. Though Rachel suffers through her treatment and her health worsens, Greg, who often breaks the fourth wall, assures viewers that she does not die in the end. Madison (Katherine C. Hughes), a pretty girl at school, convinces Greg and Earl to make a film dedicated to Rachel, and Rachel persuades Greg to apply to a local college. Greg continues to ignore schoolwork, and eventually school altogether, to finish the film. After realising that her chemotherapy is doing more harm than good, Rachel opts to discontinue her treatment. Greg and Rachel have a heated argument over her choice, with Greg accusing her of giving up on herself, and she responds stating that he will not do anything selfless unless he is told to do so. He leaves, devastated that he can no longer help her. Greg and Earl have an argument, with Greg blaming Earl for his friendship with Rachel ending. Earl in turn admonishes Greg for his inability to care and sympathise for anyone, and when Greg dares him to punch him, he does so. Later, Earl gives Greg a heartfelt testimonial for Rachel's film before letting him know that he's finished with their friendship. Greg also finds out that the college he planned to attend revoke his admission due to his poor grades. Later in the year, Greg learns that Rachel is back in the hospital and is dying. His mother encourages him to visit her. Madison invites Greg to the prom, but at the last moment, he decides to go to the hospital instead. During the journey there, the limo driver (Karriem Sami) asks Greg if he loves the girl he's going to see, he cannot bring himself to answer. He brings his iPhone and a portable projector to play the completed film he made for her. Rachel is moved to tears by the movie but falls into a coma shortly after viewing it and dies about ten hours later. Greg admits to the viewer that he lied about Rachel not dying, as he \"didn't think she would\". After her death, Rachel's mother Denise (Molly Shannon) comforts Greg and they grieve together. Earl and Greg rekindle their friendship. During the funeral, Greg sneaks into Rachel's room, where he finds a card from her stating that she wrote to Greg's college and explained that he missed school for her sake. It also states her wish for Greg to take any of her possessions that he wishes. He finds several intricate carvings within her books depicting scenes of her with Greg and Earl. Greg leaves with one of the books containing a personal carving and his favourite of Rachel's pillows. Sometime later, Greg writes his story of his time with Rachel and mails it to the college along with the film he made for her with a written warning saying, \"the last person who saw this immediately went into a coma and DIED\". Also starring Jon Bernthal as Mr. McCarthy, Matt Bennett as Scott Mayhew, Gavin Dietz as young Greg, Edward DeBruce III as young Earl, and the cameo voice of Hugh Jackman as himself / Wolverine (a wall poster). Classic movie parodies that I recognised, with spoof titles, include: Anatomy of a Burger (Anatomy of a Murder), Ate 1/2 (Of My Lunch) (Federico Fellini's 8\u00bd), A Box O'Lips, Wow (Apocalypse Now), The Battle of All Deer (The Battle of Algiers), Breathe Less (Breathless), Brew Vervet (Blue Velvet), Can't Tempt (Contempt), Crouching Housecat, Hidden Housecat (Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon), Death in Tennis (Death in Venice), Don't Look Now, Because a Creepy-Ass Dwarf is About to Kill You!!!

(Vertigo), Wages for Beer (The Wages of Fear), and 2:48 P. M. Cowboy (Midnight Cowboy). Mann gives a splendid performance as the self-obsessed socially awkward teenager, Cooke is quietly compelling as the girl with terminal cancer, Cyler is good being deadpan, and other supporting cast members get their moments. Jesse Andrews adapts his own book for the screen well, with sensitivity and quirkiness combined, it is obviously a story with inescapable sadness and emotion, but its witty sense of humour and surreal moments are what stand out, I was kind of hoping for more insight into the spoof movie-making element, but it is a watchable comedy-drama.

The surviving Girl.\"In some ways this story reminds me of \"Perks of Being a Wallflower\" where Charlie carefully avoids drawing attention to himself. In this movie Thomas Mann as Greg, has managed to get to Senior year in high school in Pittsburgh without being part of any clique or actually revealing himself to others. He has one friend, actually refuses to admit he is a friend, calls him an associate because they make parody films together. They have 42 of them.That friend is RJ Cyler as Earl.Greg's life changes when his mom tells him that a classmate, a girl, has been diagnosed with Leukemia, actually AML. That girl is cute Olivia Cooke as Rachel. Greg doesn't want to have anything to do with it but mom essentially forces him to go and spend some time with her. He thinks it will be one visit.Of course it turns out to be much more than one visit and eventually Greg and Rachel come to be best friends. The experience changes Greg, forces him to evaluate his life, it ended up being his own \"coming of age.\" As hard as he took the death of his new friend he eventually learned it is better to care deeply and lose someone than to never care deeply for anyone.Good movie with ample inventive humor, within the tone of the overall story.

For people that have lived or have good friends with cancer it might be more emotional then for people that never been in that case. Seeing the evolution of a close friend or relative with that disease is not an easy thing to live. Not for the sick neither for their relatives, friends or loved ones. With Me and Earl and the Dying Girl you get all the emotions that you are familiar with. You try to make the best out of it, you try humor to make the ill feel better, and then you see how the person give up because cancer and chemotherapy eats you away. Powerful movie for people who lived with cancer.",

And her only inspiration is the joy and fun she receives from her best high school friend and his sidekick Earl who entertain her by making their own low budget produced films and the parodies and acts are down right funny and moving.

            "content": "Here's a film that perfectly executes what is in my opinion one of the hardest things to do in a film, balance comedy and drama. So often, I complain about a film that lacks the awareness to eloquently display laughs and tears in the same film. To go along with that, cancer is an incredibly difficult thing to portray on screen. It's a personal thing for so many people and Me and Earl and the Dying Girl is one of the best films that handles cancer with delicacy and grace.Based on the 2012 novel of the same title by Jesse Andrews, Me and Earl and the Dying Girl is about a high school outcast, Greg, somewhat forced into befriending one of his classmates, Rachel, after she was diagnosed with Leukemia. Much to the same beat as 'Dope' earlier this year, Greg and his friend Earl are nerds for lack of a better word. Except this time, they geek out over classic films instead of 90's rap, which already gives the film credit from me.But meeting Rachel changed Greg in a way he doesn't initially want to admit. Their dynamic is a funny one, but it's also incredibly emotionally satisfying. This film also isn't your typical depressing story about death and grieving, it's surprisingly really funny and touching. Credit has to be given to Alfonso Gomez-Rejon, the director. I loved his style with the various camera positions and timely long takes. He had a knack for keeping the camera locked on his actors at just the right time and holding a zoom just long enough.Praise should also be given to the actors. Molly Shannon, Connie Britton, and Nick Offerman all give good performances, but that's to be expected. I really thought Thomas Mann and Olivia Cooke stood out the most. The entire weight of the film rests on the ability to pull off their comedic timing but also bring the film to the emotional depths the script calls for. I love a good coming of age film, so this film was right up my alley. But the plot unfolds unexpectedly and it's handled in a unique and respectful way, so I can recommend this to anybody.+Direction+Perfectly balances comedy and drama+Unpredictable+Performances all around8.4/10",

I think it extends beyond what's happening on screen and it feels like such a passion project for Rejon. I've seen countless of coming-of-age films, and even though on the surface the narrative here seems pretty familiar (just recently, The Spectacular Now) there's something inherently distinct about this. In terms of directorial style, it's definitely more showy than most. Much of it reminded me of Wes Anderson-lite. And by the end, the film is immensely likable...But I would be lying if I said it also didn't annoy me at times. Its insistence with being overly cute and whimsical definitely needs some getting used to. From the start you can tell the film is really trying, so the fact that by the end it does come across as actually sincere is a huge surprise. Especially because, yeah, there are so many instances where it really goes overboard. Really? Going into a coma at that precise moment he shows her the film? I guess it's meant to convey a feeling more than anything, as the film definitely seems to operate in its own world, but still...I have quite a few problems with it. Part of me is telling me not to ignore the many instances where the film just didn't work, and yet I still liked it quite a bit. I don't even know what to grade it, and no idea how I'll feel about it a week from now. I could honestly see myself disliking it more just as easily as the opposite.",

The many film parodies Earl and Greg make are a delight, just as much as the scenes with Rachel that nearly had me in tears. However, I will say that the film is not as special as it thinks it is, there is an air of confidence throughout that they are doing something unlike any other film, but I can think of several other movies (The Way Way Back, Rushmore) that created a very likewise vibe. As well as that, it constantly refers to what is going to happen at the end in a way that they clearly thought they were being clever, but I did not care for it. The cast is all around brilliant, Thomas Mann, RJ Cyler and Olivia Cooke are all the stars in their titular roles, and the likes of Molly Shannon, Nick Offerman and Jon Bernthal also shine in smaller, but very noticeable parts. Fun and sweet. A very enjoyable hour and a half, I would recommend Me and Earl and the Dying Girl to anyone looking for a good comedy drama. \nA young boy gets involved with a new girl in town, despite her fatal illness. \nBest Performance: Olivia Cooke",

Maybe is because of the influence of that trend called hipster, IDK, I miss movies like Good Will Hunting, As Good as It Gets, etc. I am talking about drama movies that delivers a lot of emotions. In this movie you can hardly remember a great line or scene that stays in your head. Well I hope that this kind of trend end soon and we began to see some quality movies. Don't get me wrong I don't think that everything is bad nowdays, for example in my opinion the movie \"The Way Way Back\", was a pretty decent movie and I think that is in the same tone of this \"indie\" \"modern/retro\" kind of movie, but WAY WAY BETTER THAN THIS MOVIE \"Me and Earl...\"",

            "content": "A cleverly put together and thoughtful indie dramedy that does the near impossible job of being many different things often all at once, Alfonso Gomez-Rejon has turned this former Black List listed script by Jesse Andrews into a likable and unique tale of friendship, growing up and perhaps most importantly, the way movies inspire and influence our lives.For film lovers Me and Earl and the Dying Girl will be a real treat with its numerable movie references and wistful low budget reincarnations of classic films both well-known and more abstract, and where films like Michel Gondry's terrible Be Kind Rewind tried to pay homage to the art of home movie making, Earl succeeds in showcasing the joys that can be found for film lovers who take their keenness one step further into the realms of no budget reincarnations. Gomez-Rejon does a great job of never allowing these films to take over however and his movie is competent enough to stand by itself with a strangely touching and unpredictable arc.Playing nicely against such genre conventions, Earl never actually threatens to become a teen romance that we've seen so many times before and we can be thankful as an audience member that Earl is in fact just a simple tale of friendship. Played well by our trio of young actors in the form of lead Thomas Mann as Greg, the impressive Olivia Cooke as the Dying Girl of the title Rachel and RJ Cyler as Greg's \"colleague\" and comic relief partner Earl, the film wins bonus points thanks to these talented performers. Greg in particular is an interesting character, a shy teen who is afraid to show his true colours for fear of retribution and while his not an always likable character, he is certainly someone we grow to appreciate even when his being self-loathing and self-defeating. With strong yet small supports from Jon Bernthal and the scene stealing Nick Offerman, Earl's cast is a real winner.Me and Earl and the Dying Girl is a quietly affecting and unpredictable affair filmed with an impressive energy and style by Gomez-Rejon a clear audience favourite that garnered some of Sundance's top gongs at this year's festival, Earl strangely found a tough time recently at the American box office meaning that there are a large portion of us yet to see this likable and unique journey, if your one of these people, Earl is well worth your time.3 \u00bd fluffy pillows out of 5",

            "content": "Life changes for a philosophical high school student when his mother guilts him into keeping a classmate dying of leukemia company in this quirky comedy starring Thomas Mann, RJ Cyler and Olivia Cooke as the three title characters. The trajectory of the film is not hard to predict with Mann (the 'Me' in the title) coming to truly appreciate his new friend and reevaluate the way he has pigeonholed all of his peers over the years. And yet, the film remains thoroughly encapsulating thanks to witty, observant narration from Mann and a fun subplot in which Mann and Cyler \"swede\" classic films, 'Be Kind Rewind' style. There are some well done moose and chipmunk claymation scenes too that reflect how Mann feels about the girl who he has a crush on taunting him. It is Mann's highly calculated approach to surviving the high school experience that stands out the most though with his attempts to befriend everyone and every clique at his school to avoid developing enemies. He makes for a fascinating character too with his reluctance to call anyone a true friend out of fear of rejection. The final few scenes of the film go a little overboard in his painting Man as a generous, giving and selfless soul behind his detached exterior, but there is a lot to like in the way Mann comes to realise that he is not quite as cynical as he once thought. Given the key themes of death and dying, the movie makes a sharp argument for never letting oneself get too detached in life no matter how hard some things may be to endure.",

            "content": "\"Me and Earl and the Dying Girl\" was directed by Alfonso Gomez-Rejon. It stars Thomas Mann as Greg, a bright high school senior who has spent almost four years keeping a low profile. He has only one friend, Earl, played by RJ Cyler. Earl and Greg produce their own video movies, which are parodies of classic films. These videos are hilarious, and they are truly unique. The films are one of the most original ideas I've seen in a movie. (The filmmakers thoughtfully list all of the movies at the end, along with the original films that Greg and Early parodied. We are only shown a handful during the movie.) Olivia Cooke plays Rachel, who has acute myelogenous leukemia. It's Rachel's fatal disease that sets the plot into motion, and everything else in the film revolves around that. AML isn't funny, but somehow Gomez-Rejon keeps a firewall between Greg's coming-of-age and the basic tragedy of his friend's illness.The acting of all three leads is superb, the supporting cast is excellent, and the movie is never boring. We saw it in Rochester's excellent Little Theatre, but it will work almost as all on the small screen. My suggestion--find it and see it. It's unique.",

This is a beautiful tale of the friendship between an antisocial ( or mini - social ) teenager and a terminally ill patient. Sure it sounds like this has been done before and I can assure you there are many movies out there that convey this same message, but when the movie brings a feeling of regret that is comparable to the loss of a limb, that's when you know that the picture has done justice to that very topic.

Me and Earl and the Dying Girl, a quirky and lovely study of teendom and friendship, is one of those serendipitous occasions in which the films skill and flow make it seem effortless. It's a refreshingly quiet high school dramedy with the unforced ability to be simultaneously sincere and LOL funny. As sounds of smart and honest laughter rang throughout my theater, this indie charmed the socks off me. The titular \"Me\" is an adolescent named Greg, who spends his days making movie parodies with his \"co-worker\" Earl, obligingly visiting a cancer-ridden classmate he barely knows, and trying to stay anonymous. Much like John Hughes films, it represents teens with a heightened reality, relying on stereotypes slightly more than it should. However, Greg's world is a fun one to visit, staying plenty recognizable as you envy its idiosyncrasies. These are most apparent in the collage of fantastic characters, showcasing in long takes the performer's considerable talents. Everyone, especially the three teens in the title, is full of human self-absorption, wide-eyed wonder, and an immense sense of humor. While its entertainment goals are fully realized, it could also serve as an incredible resource for teens dealing with sickness and loss, things outside of their control. It looks at sadness with a suspicious eye, allowing it to exist but never rule. M&E&tDG provides an honest, irreverent, and dryly hilarious look at teenage sickness that stick with you.",

            "content": "Me and Earl and the Dying Girl is a brilliant new coming of age film that follows coworkers Greg and Earl through their senior year of high school. Their seemingly quiet and low key lives are altered forever after befriending a classmate who has been diagnosed with cancer. In this new age masterpiece, Greg, Earl and Rachel must navigate through the treacherous territories of high school and growing up while dealing with Rachel's illness. This film is beautiful, truly a must see for not only teens, but adults as well. It is so refreshing. It's very rare that I find a movie that depicts what it's like to be a teenager and grow up in this day and age with such honesty and genuine emotion. The movie is narrated by Greg, played by Thomas Mann, with his internal dialogue. I resonated with that so much. This is not your typical high school, coming of age movie. This is a raw, real film that will move just about anyone. Director Alfonso Gomez-Rejon and cinematographer Chung Hoon-Chung do an extraordinary job with the visuals of this film and creating characters out of the locations and sets. The unique and creative stance taken with the shot sequences and camera angles is fascinating. There are many scenes that are one long continuous shot or filled with unique zooming and panning techniques. Every shot is captivating and draws you deeper into the film, making every aspect of the movie flow seamlessly and take on a personality of its own. In this movie, Greg and Earl occupy most of their time by making parodies of classic and foreign films. In many scenes, we get to watch a few clips from their homemade movies and it is very interesting to see all of the different styles and filmmaking tactics they use. They experiment with puppetry, stop motion, live action and many other film styles. It is so cool to see all of these different techniques in one movie, making Me and Earl and the Dying Girl feel like a true ode to cinema.The heavy subject matter of cancer, life and death is balanced by brilliant humor that will leave you laughing out loud. But, this film is definitely not a comedy. I found myself crying on multiple occasions. This film really makes me think about my life and the people that are in it. I think one of the best things about film is when it makes you think long after the credits have stopped rolling. Me and Earl and the Dying Girl is one of those gems of a film that really leaves you asking questions and delving into your thoughts. It's difficult to pick my favorite character because the cast is so studded with insanely talented individuals. The three main characters - Greg, played by Thomas Mann, Earl, played by RJ Cyler and Rachel played by Olivia Cooke, all work together so flawlessly. Watching their relationship grow and develop over the course of the film is wonderful. Thomas Mann is an amazing actor and this film really shows off his talent. In most of his feature films he plays the goofy awkward teen and it's never much of a serious character, but in this film you are able to see the variety he brings to the screen. I am a huge fan of Olivia Cooke, she stars in Bates Motel and The Signal which is one of my favorite movies, watching her in this very challenging roll is phenomenal. Her character development over the course of the film is so moving. She deals with her illness in such a raw and real way while gracefully accepting what she cannot change. This is RJ Cylers' first feature film and he does a wonderful job. His character Earl provides quite a bit of comedic relief while also staying very real and grounded. Although he's not one to talk up a storm, when he does speak he often delivers a powerful message. There are so many amazing supporting actors in this film that really tie everything together, but it would take me forever to go over all of them so I'll move on.I can't say I have a favorite scene because as I said before, every shot and every scene is captivating. There isn't a single moment when I am uninterested in what I am seeing. The brilliant use of color, lighting, movement and setting to convey emotion is truly remarkable and should be inspiration for filmmakers everywhere. This film does feature a bit of mature language since it is centered around high schoolers who are not always known to have the cleanest mouths, but I don't think the profanity is gratuitous or unnecessary. It keeps the film very real. This movie is heavy because of the topics of illness and death. It definitely brought most of the audience to tears, myself included. So be prepared to have your heart strings pulled. I recommend this film for ages 13 to 18 and highly suggest that adults watch it as well because I believe that people of many age groups can relate to the film and find it enjoyable.I give Me and Earl and the Dying Girl 5 out of 5 stars, so make sure you check it out in theaters this summer!Reviewed by Raven D., KIDS FIRST!

            "content": "Ugh. I'm not opposed to films that have an offbeat sense of humour, but stylistically this did very little for me. The distractingly showy direction is just one of the facets through which Me and Earl and the Dying Girl expresses its inflated self-importance. In reality, it is absolutely unremarkable and significantly less intelligent than it assumes itself to be.I'm not sure how much of the overwhelming praise for this film originates from the gimmick of referencing classic cinema. This is likely recognition-humour in its most irritating manifestation. Director Alfonso Gomez-Rejon invites the audience to engage in a circle jerk of ego-stroking \u2013 a showcase of how well-read and cineliterate we all are (All the while never choosing a film not already archived by Criterion).*It doesn't help that the main character is just as self-obsessed and detestable as the film itself. 'I know you're really bracing for this sweet girl, that you probably like a lot, to die', he says in the terribly self-aware narration, yet the film does so little to endear us to Rachel. This is an odd choice, considering any emotional punch depends upon this attachment. The titular Earl, too, is entirely one-dimensional. The secondary characters appear to exist only in the presence of the protagonist. Rather than give these characters any depth, we instead get to watch Greg be entitled for an hour and 45 minutes.The end product provokes little other than indifference. I don't care about the cut- outs masquerading as characters, and I really don't care about Greg and his problems. Even dealing with such a heavy topic, the film is so wrapped in clich\u00e9 and so smugly post-modern at the expense of any sense of realistic grounding that any gravity evaporates \u2013 kudos to Gomez-Rejon on this one, it's genuinely an achievement to provoke so little sympathy for a character with cancer.*Gomez-Rejon, to Martin Scorsese: \"You turned me onto film history as a kid. This was a way to continue that tradition, by talking about movies that a younger generation could go out and find, and not necessarily the popular ones.\" Ugh.",

I went anyway with my five friends to give it a shot, WORST DECISION EVER!!!!!!!! The movie started off bad with the main character telling you that the movies he makes are so bad they literally kill a girl. Then it progressed with weird camera maneuvers making most of my friends and I dizzy. The story line was horrific with absolutely nothing happening,except the girls cancer getting worse and the main character accidentally getting stoned. After an hour me and 2 of my friends decided to leave and get some ice cream as we were falling asleep. When we came back the movie still wasn't over and decided to just join the rest of our friends to watch the end. I didn't think it was possible for the movie to get worse but it did. I am a sucker for Indie and romantic movies but this movie literally made me want to rip my eyeballs out. I thought it would be in someway normal but everything that happened was just so stupid pointless and made me cringe. The ending was atrocious and severely annoyed me as Greg said throughout the movie that Rachel doesn't die but surprise surprise what do you think happened.

That's actually worse.\"There are movies I really could dwell on in a lyrical way. Because it's put together cleverly and cunningly. Or because I could empathize with the characters. Or because the humorous content was taken up throughout the story in a professional way. Call me oversensitive or sentimental. But \"Me and Earl and The Dying Girl\" is a movie that I'm extremely lyrical about. Firstly, because they tackled such an emotional subject in a very clever and witty way. Without significant effort they could have made a major tearjerker out of it, so Kleenex would suddenly see a miraculous growth of its quarterly earnings and cinemas should install additional emergency generators so they could handle the tsunami of tears. However, the end result is the opposite of that. Never before a smile and a tear were so close together.This movie is original, sad and funny at the same time. A \"coming of age\" film avant la lettre. Although the theme isn't new. Teenage girl Rachel (Olivia \"The Signal\" Cooke) is diagnosed with leukemia. But the course of this deadly disease has been depicted in a serene way. And this with the mandatory involvement of Greg (Thomas Mann) whose mother (Connie Britton) asked him in a rather authoritative way to spend some time with Rachel. What follows is an impossible friendship that grows out into an intimate relationship with understanding, support and hope as important key values. Greg is someone I could relate to because I was basically the same person at that age. A bit of an insecure individual who's trying to make himself invisible and blend in with the crowd. The message is : make sure no one notices you and use humor, sarcasm and funny one-liners as a defense. Actually, he's the opposite of someone like Scott Mayhew. This screwed up, freaky goth uses his eccentric appearance to demarcate a territory. Greg's way of demarcation is to avoid everyone or to maintain superficial contacts.The only person Greg usually has contact with is Earl (RJ Cyler). Earl is not really a friend in the strict sense of the word (according to Greg) but rather a \"co-worker\". A like-minded with whom he shares a passion for the classics among films. Together they spend their free time making parodies of these classics. These extreme bad films are shown sporadically and made sure I had a few spontaneous laughs. Not because of their probably ridiculous content, but because of the quirky fictional titles such as \"Raging Bullshit\", \"A sockwork Orange\" or \"Vere'd He Go?\". It's fair to say that Earl is a friend for life.The Holy Trinity is completed by Rachel. A lovable young girl facing a deadly disease and still she retains a clear look at the whole situation. Clearly someone who doesn't want or needs pity. Despite the deadly disease, she manages to keep her character alive. She transforms from the closed, dismissive girl who resigned to her fate into a frivolous, blossoming fighter thanks to Greg's carefree, somewhat clumsy but humorous way. This transformation is completed with one of the most moving and impressing closing scenes ever.Each one of these are charming, irresistible interpretations, realized in a highly professional and open-minded way by three unknown young actors. This wonderful cast raise \"Me and Earl and the dying girl\" to an outstanding level. The end result is a poignant and touching film about friendship and at the same time an homage to classic films. It's a relief to discover something like this among all the other commercial crap and the umpteenth exploited sequel. Finally once again a fresh, intelligent and original film. And this thanks to the wonderful acting and the willful use of non obvious film techniques (I should mention that as well). A successful end result, perfectly bypassing all the obvious clich\u00e9s from the genre so it didn't end up as a common melodrama. Masterly !More reviews here : http://bit.ly/1KIdQMT",

            "content": "Me and Earl and the Dying Girl is a coming of age story about a young boy called Greg, whose mother makes him befriend Rachel, a girl at school who has been diagnosed with leukaemia. She is the \"dying girl\" of the title, whilst Earl is Greg's friend, although, because of his insecurities, he prefers to call him a co-worker. Co-worker because they make short films together, which are based on real movies and are reminiscent of the scenes in Be Kind Rewind, in which Jack Black and Mos Def tried to remake the films that were erased from the tapes in their video store. Greg has been raised in an unusual household with a movie-loving father who lives on strange and exotic food, and an over-protective mother who has mollycoddled her son to such a degree that he can't truly fit in at school, although he's smart and deliberately keeps a low profile. Unlike Earl, who is street tough and full of attitude, although he's more of a cypher despite being a very interesting character. Some of their films, incidentally, have titles like \"The Turd Man\", \"A Sockwork Orange\" and \"Pooping Tom\". What ensues, however, is a very touching and genuine relationship that develops between Greg and Rachel, with both uncomfortable around each other at first, then slowly finding a shared sense of humour that grows warmer and more gentle as the story unfolds. Along the way Greg serves as the film's narrator, occasionally breaking the fourth wall and having each chapter of the story captioned on screen. It's easy to get to know and like Earl, and to care about Rachel, especially when such a cine- literate movie refrains from being smug or too smart for its own good, but thrives on who and what its characters are. It's superbly directed by Alfonso Gomez-Rejon, whose only other movie is the recent remake of The Town that Dreaded Sundown. Whilst Brian Eno's excellent score feels just right in every possible way. But this is a quirky and unique drama that's intelligent and moving, with sweet notes that are matched by genuine depth and superb performances from a young cast. And a fantastic cameo cameo, I should add.",

            "content": "Talking about death is hard enough but creating a lighthearted and charming story revolving around death is something that most people wouldn't even bother to attempt. Me and Earl and the Dying Girl is based on the novel of the same name written by Jesse Andrews who also wrote the screenplay for the film. It is directed by Alfonso Gomez-Rejon and is about a boy named Greg who doesn't have many friends and carefully avoids joining any social cliques at his school. He is soon told by his mother that one of his classmates, Rachel, is diagnosed with leukemia as she forces him to go to Rachel's house and spend time with her. The two quickly grow to like one another's company which puts Greg into hilariously awkward situations as the story unfolds. He and his only friend Earl decide to dedicate a film to Rachel because of the strong bonds they formed during their doomed friendship.The first thing that is apparent is that director Alfonso Gomez- Rejon has an eye for cinema. The direction and cinematography in this film are incredible and some of the best I've seen so far this year. The shot compositions here reminded me a lot of Wes Anderson's The Grand Budapest Hotel but with its own unique spin. Gomez-Rejon seriously has a great chance at winning best director by the end of the year. The next stand out thing the movie had was great actors and a great script. The three main characters of Greg, Earl and Rachel were extremely believable and their actors all did a great job. They all had excellent chemistry together on top of a hilariously original script that kept me laughing and entertained for most of the film. There are only a couple jokes that fell a little flat but there are so many funny lines here that the few duds are overlooked. There is one particular sequence that is done exceptionally well but I won't spoil it for you. Let's just say it involves drugs, ice cream and people in animal costumes.Sadly there are a couple negatives with the film that I thought kept this movie at only being good and not great. Besides the few dull jokes the only other problems I had with the film were that it had some pacing issues and it did not reach the emotional high point it was going for in some parts of the film. These two issues go hand in hand because (SPOILER ALERT) around the half way point Greg and Rachel get in a fight because Rachel no longer wants to continue with her chemotherapy which Greg assumes Rachel is giving up on her life and doesn't want to see her die. Greg then finds Earl because he told her about the secret film they were making in her honor which causes them to fight leaving both Earl and Rachel mostly absent for the rest of the film. These two scenes were meant to create remorse and sympathy for Greg but they don't leave the emotional impact that they should which creates a slower and blander plot device that throws off the unique feel the movie had established in the beginning.Overall this film is filled with charm and lovable characters even though it doesn't go as deep as it should with its story. Thomas Mann as Greg was easily my favorite part of the movie and character as I often saw myself in him while I was watching this film. If you enjoy smaller budget/indie films this one deserves to be seen.",

It was such a authentic story full of self- discovery, insecurity, fear and love, director Alfonso Gomez-Rejon did a pleasurable job of capturing the essence of what this film was trying to present.The performances from the three leads were all excellent, Thomas Mann gave a very delicate performance as Greg, who was quirky yet likable. RJ Cyler, who portrayed Earl, was most certainly excellent stole the show, for a newcomer, I must say that he has bright future ahead of him. Finally, Olivia Cooke was fantastic as presenting Rachel as someone who embraces laughter alongside bitterness and pain, a character that you can come to love and feel for.Alfonso did such a wonderful job of sharing humor, heartbreak, joy and self-reflection in just a story of a dying girl while imbuing with authenticity and filmic sophistication that makes the story's highs and lows all the more impactful. Movie lovers will most likely get a kick out of all the film parodies, like The 400 Bros, Rosemary Baby Carrots, A Sockwork Orange & 2:48 PM Cowboy.Me and Earl and The Dying Girl may seem like a typical high school film to some but in all honestly is something much more than just that, this film is just a tale of pride and self- reflection through the eyes of teenager. A must-see to all movie lovers out there because it's such a brave piece of filmmaking. Alfonso whips out camera techniques that makes the film more unique with a spec of quirkiness. The narrative, bridging humor with heart- wrenching reality & an inspiring take of personal growth, does tug at your heartstrings with the well scripted dialogue and chemistry between the characters. At its core, MAEATDG is most certainly a grand story of love and friendship in a time of uncertain circumstances.",

            "content": "This movie is primarily about teenagers but, might have appealed to a wider audience had the characters of the parents been treated a little less like caricatures. After all, it's the parent of the 'Me' of the title (Greg) - who instigates the relationship that forms the basis for the whole show. It possibly could also have done with less crude 'teen humour' (not that it's overdone just a little suss). Thomas Mann plays Greg with a winsome flare and handles the changing personality very well.RJ Cyler also does well with his at times token-gesture part, but never-the-less important role as Earle. Olivia Cook plays Rachel ('The Girl') with the right degree of spirit, humour and pathos. The character for Molly Shannon (as Rachel's mum) we've already covered. Still, as this film weaves its way to a well realized conclusion (one you did but also did not quite expect) it leaves the viewer with some powerful emotional thoughts. Director of photography Chung-Hoon Chung gives us a mix of mostly very good images.Music is provided via an interesting combination of Brian Eno and Nico Mulhly's works. The clay-mation type introductions to Greg & Earle's home-made-movie parodies of popular mainstream features are inventive - although, some of the subject matter of the chosen original movie titles just happen to be inappropriate for their school years - then again, that's the way it is these days - and they wonder why there's so much young American blood being spilled on campuses and the streets...It's thoughtful enough to be worth a look.",

            "review_title": "A Teen Dramedy for the Ages",
            "content": "Greg (Mann), our plucky narrator has survived almost all of his high school tenure thanks to carefully cultivated invisibility. He wades through the school's classrooms and hallways with a light touch, only finding the time to get to know Earl (Cyler) whom he calls his co-worker. Greg is almost out of the woods of high school until he's forced by his mother (Britton) to hang out with Rachel (Cooke) a solemn classmate with stage-4 leukemia.The intricate human details and bittersweet moments of kindness in Me and Earl and the Dying Girl elevates the film to the level of Perks of Being a Wallflower (2012). Director Alfonso Gomez-Rejon masterfully captures the generational zeitgeist of the wayward millennial with a eye for vulnerability under language fraught with sarcasm and double entendres. The film is remarkably sincere, excitingly funny and almost playful at times with its visual geometric cavorting. The film is laden with visual cues, interesting angles and Arrested Development-type (2003-present) asides that aid in the visual collage.Greg and Earl spend their time making silly low-budget parodies of beloved art house films. Depending on who you are and your knowledge of film, Greg's pastime simultaneously provides the best parts of the film but also its singularly largest drawback. Without giving too much away, the climax of the film involves the viewing of Greg and Earl's opus which is heavily influenced on the work of Stan Brakhage. As the scene plays out it resembles (either purposely or by coincidence) the famous visual montage near the end of Soylent Green (1973) which takes away from the truthfulness of the scene. That is unless you are not a big film buff, in which case the scene will strike a cord while rendering the parodies throughout moot.Yet the universality of the emotions shines through in beautiful and unexpected ways. Even the most seasoned and cynical will find something alluring about Rachel's plight, Greg's self-deprecation and Earl's brutal honesty. Olivia Cooke is a frail vision as the titular \"Dying Girl\" giving her character a unique balance of strength and fear of the possible hereafter. She's not the embodiment of all that's pure and good like Mandy Moore in A Walk to Remember (2002) which definitely works in her favor. Her mother played by Molly Shannon shares the same fear as Rachel but aptly covers her depression with alcohol and giving Greg the occasional sultry side-eye. As far as supporting characters are concerned, Shannon does the finest work of them all; though there's something to be said about Nick Offerman's stay-at-home professor.All-in-all, Me and Earl and the Dying Girl is a sumptuous movie with charmingly funny set-pieces that keep the story from becoming too maudlin. Casual audiences will find a lot to love in the growing and changing relationships between the characters while serious filmophiles will be further rewarded with numerous parodies to classic films such as \"Gross Encounters of the Turd Kind,\" \"My Dinner with Andre the Giant,\" and \"Anatomy of a Burger.\" The eloquence with which Gomez- Rejon uses the space of the frame and the playful use of symmetry elevates the film beyond the slew of indie dramas that are high in humanism but perhaps overbearing in their neo-realist aesthetic. Me and Earl and the Dying Girl rightfully joins The Perks of Being a Wallflower, Dope (2015) and The Way Way Back (2013) as one of the defining teen comedies of this generation.",

There is no overwhelming pressure of a love story or some revelation of identity often discovered in our years of adolescence. It captures a brief time frame of a few friends who are struggling with the weight of death, trying everything to revive the small bit of joy that might reside. With a few long, unedited shots of raw emotion and scenes of best friends fighting, we play the third person in the room bearing the awkwardness of a premature threat to life. But the drama and emotion is not without humor. The characters are funny - naturally funny. The poorly executed puns and sometimes almost offensive (to the easily offended) jokes are a great coping mechanism for both the actor and the observer that are nothing short of authentic. Oh and it helps that Greg is so painfully awkward at times, the viewer almost feels worse for him than the dying girl. A great story of laughter, tears, and justified anger, Me and Earl and the Dying Girl goes beyond the usual teenage story and brings us a new, emotionally provocative perspective.",

There, there is my snarky cinephile reflection.. wink, wink, nudge, nudge. If you love the movies, and hate John Green novels with a burning passion, welcome to your heaven on earth. This is the ultimate hipster, meta-movie, movie that eye- rollers and Starbucks drinkers will love to death.. but for all the right reasons. As a cinephile, I felt like I was apart of an abstract German art piece, where I was being smacked with a trout. In other words, I felt like the artsy dick that this movie knew I was. But I found it, just really, really funny. These two guys are so smart, so clever, and so dedicated to film, that by the end of it all, I just wanted to hang out with them. They knew who they were, they knew they were in a movie, and they knew it was going to be a sappy love story where a girl dies at the end.. spoiler alert.. she does, but you already knew that. But the film, aside from being hilarious, is absolutely beautiful. Not because of it's academic knowledge of cinematography techniques from the greatest film directors spanning hundreds of years, but because it handles it's love story so gracefully and realistically. Without warning, the Dying girl takes a turn for the worst, and without warning, the film becomes devastatingly sad, and really heartfelt. I wanted to just hug myself. Two scenes in particular have some of the best acting and emotional depth of any movie i've seen this year. Olivia Cooke could very well be nominated for an Academy Award for her performance. Bottom line, as a first picture for this director, this film is mind-blowingly good. It's as if Alfonso Gomez-Rejon has been with us this whole time, but in the form of every filmmaker we've ever known of. I hope we see more films from him. I know they will be just as good.",

            "content": "Teen dramas aren't really my thing, and I try to avoid movie heartbreak and emotion at all costs. Yet I have to say that I really enjoyed this movie. The sincere, emotional performances by the young cast were incredible, the movie parodies made me laugh out loud, and the whole look and feel of the movie was original and exciting.THE PART WHERE I COMPARE THIS MOVIE TO BRICKThe last teenage movie I enjoyed this much was BRICK, with Joseph Gordon-Levitt. Greg and Brandon have a lot in common. Both of them are loners, not necessarily tough guys, but guys who know how to stay away from the crowd and avoid the wrong kind of people. Both of them have a way of doing business that works for them. But then there's a girl in trouble, and she's the kind of girl you can't forget. And the hero has to deal with the reality of losing that type of girl and what that says about how he's lived his life up till now.The problem is the comedy in ME AND EARL isn't as gripping as the film noir menace of BRICK. Greg's goofy movie parodies don't really save the day. When Brandon loses Emily he can't save her. But he can get to the bottom of the story. He finds out about the bad brick and poor Frisco. He even gets to break a few deserving teeth along the way. Greg just makes a lot of silly jokes about old movie classics. To put it another way, every time Brandon kicks ass, every time he demands answers from Dode or Tug or the Pin, it's really about Emily. But when Greg makes goofy movie parodies, or gets slapped around in the cafeteria, or grovels like a worm before his all-powerful mother, it's not about Rebecca. It's about him being goofy. And while Brandon's enemies are tough, serious, fully rounded characters who make powerful antagonists, Greg is mostly dealing with silly cartoon characters when he isn't spending time with Rebecca.THE PART WHERE I TALK ABOUT OTHER MOVIESNotice what's missing from the movie parodies. They have time to poke fun at A Clockwork Orange and The Midnight Cowboy, both classics I love from the Seventies. But strangely enough, they never mention Love Story or Brian's Song. What do you say about a seventeen year old girl who dies? That's a line from Love Story, and it would have fit this movie perfectly. But hey, let's not do that movie. It's a downer. Let's make Alex and his gang into sock puppets!Now I had no problem with lily-white Greg having a tough black sidekick like Earl. It's a cherished American tradition. Come back to the cancer ward again, Huck honey! But the two boys never parody movies with black characters or themes. Why is that? I mean, the title of this movie is Me and Earl and the Dying Girl. And I kept thinking that was a reference to a Cornbread, Earl, and Me, which is a Seventies classic. And it's about black people. And there's a character who dies tragically. And I was really hoping for a reference, or a parody, or something to indicate that, you know, black people are capable of making movies and really feeling stuff, even without white people around to care about. But that never happened.I wonder why!",

One of those films for me is 'E.T.', as I saw the movie with my parents in theaters back in the early 80s when it was released. That film really struck a chord with me as it was the first time I really connected with a character and a film. It led to all the emotions pouring out of me, and still does to this day even when I watch it for the 1,134th time. Only a handful of movies have done that to me since then, one of them being this beautiful and charming movie, 'Me and Earl and the Dying Girl'.Once again, I found myself so enthralled and connected to these characters, and even related to a lot of the situations here, that it was very difficult for me to let them go once the credits ended. I found myself constantly thinking of how great the film and how amazing the performances were by Thomas Mann, Olivia Cooke, and Ronald Cyler II, that it made me go through my old photographs of friends and old home movies I made when I was younger. It brought up a lot of great memories. First and foremost, 'Me and Earl and the Dying Girl' is a movie for passionate movie lovers.There are so many amazing head nods and winks to a vast amount of excellent films of all genres, that I could fill ten pages mentioning all of them in single space typing. It was as if a good friend of mine who was there with me while I watched the thousands upon thousands of movies, made a film, showcasing the greats in their own vision. Seeing this movie isn't just going to the theater and watching something, it's an experience on such a great level of emotion that you want to be a better person to those around you.The \"me\" in the title of the film is Greg (Mann), a high school student who makes funny short films based off other movies with his best friend Earl (Cyler). Greg is kind of an outsider at school and even spends his lunch in his teacher's (Jon Bernthal) office, watching old movies with Earl. Greg's eclectic parents (Connie Britton and Nick Offerman) tell Greg that a schoolmate of his named Rachel has just been diagnosed with leukemia and that he should spend time with her. Reluctant to do so, Rachel and Greg form a relationship so pure and amazing, that it reminds me of the friends and times I had with them when I was that age.'Me and Earl and the Dying Girl' is very self aware of the movie it is, as Greg narrates most of the film of what's to come. The bonds these characters form in the short 105 minute time frame of the movie is so moving that you won't want the film to end. These are the types of friends we all hope to have had in high school, flaws and all. Director Alfonso Gomez-Rejon captures each emotional moment and genuine character trait perfectly. You can definitely tell he's a huge fan of film itself, which is one of the reasons this one is so perfect.'Me and Earl and the Dying Girl' is one of those few movies that will stick around for years to come, where people will still talk about it to their friends and their favorite moments from the film. Perhaps it will even inspire people to make their own movies and to be better people. I cannot recommend this movie enough.",

He is forced by his parents to meet a childhood friend Rachel (Olivia Cooke) who has been diagnosed with cancer. At first neither of two are interested in each other, but Greg's quirkiness interests Rachel and they meet regularly.

Thomas Mann and Olivia Cooke have acted well along with Rj Cyler, whose role as Earl is a bit curtailed in the movie. The movie grabbed several awards and nominations in many festivals. The songs of the movie are heart-warming. It is a good watch for people who are not in touch with their own sense of inner LOVE and unaware of their feelings of LOVE for others.I would go with 6.25",

After watching it I must say that those ratings are well-deserved for the most part. Me and Earl and the Dying Girl has a somewhat different and kind of funny plot. A boy is told he has to hang out with a girl who has cancer, but he doesn't want to do it and ends up becoming friends with her anyways. It's one of those 'unlikely friendship' stories, but it's done pretty well for the most part. It's overall a pretty funny movie too, so the somewhat goofy plot fits really well. Unfortunately this movie follows a formula that we all know and love. The only difference is that this one follows the average romantic movie formula but it's not a romance. I found that I was really hoping that certain things didn't happen, but then they did anyways, over and over until eventually it became apparent that this was the formula. A movie being formulaic isn't always a bad thing, but in this movie it just stood out as something poorly done while everything else is well done for the most part. The characters are pretty good. They're obviously the focus of the movie, but I felt like they could have been developed a little better. Greg's character felt a little out of place, being the 'lonely kid-that-everyone-likes-but-still-has-no-friends-but-is- actually-really-fun-to-be-around', which is a character that I think we've all seen before. Although his character is done well for the most part, he's still not fantastic. Earl felt like he had a pretty minor part in the movie, and we never go too deep into his character, nor does he get nearly enough screen time. Then there's Rachel, the dying girl, whom I thought was the best of the characters. She felt the most like a real person of all of them. However, I feel like the relationship between Rachel and Greg could have been done better, instead of being shown through a montage of them hanging out more towards the end. It was still done well, but I think that it could have been better. I found that the characters didn't stand out that much either, other then Greg's parents, whom I liked quite a bit. Overall Me and Earl and the Dying Girl is pretty good, but suffers from predictability and not-the-greatest characters. There were a few very small things about the movie that also really bothered me, but they aren't overly important. In the end, though, I'd still definitely recommend this movie. It's still lot's of fun to watch.",

            "content": "Me and Earl and the Dying Girl focuses on a cynical, self-hating teenager, Greg. He narrates his senior year by explaining how less special he is and how terrible high school is. He believes that his self-awareness about his shortcomings would make him sound smarter, but it also makes him sound even more selfish. Until, of course, he befriends with this girl who was just diagnosed with leukemia and suppose to earn sympathy towards her and realize that there are people dealing with bigger problems than his own. The movie thankfully doesn't hammer in some full sentimentality and it's wise enough to keeping itself honest towards the issues they are dealing with. But even so, the film feels a little too shallow, while the craft is admirable, it seems like much of the effort came to that work of pretension rather than rising this story into something much more compelling. Nonetheless, it's still quite entertaining, but it still deserves something a lot better.The movie's only concern is how Greg would grow to this part of his high school life, how interacting with Rachel would somehow change him to finally empathize other people. The film avoids the simple sappiness that often resolves their issues, like the hero would instantly get a change of heart, life instantly gets better and only destroyed by death or something. The film rather find more subtle ways to develop the character, reminding us that his cynicism shouldn't be taken away that easily. But it would have been more interesting if it explores the other characters and their concern; Earl seems like a typical best friend, or they shall call it co-worker, no matter how much they explain how different he is for his history. His backstory is briefly explained and that wouldn't be enough if he is suppose to be as important as the other two main characters. Much important is Rachel, who clearly easily wants to give up after losing her hair and everything, but she seems to be just an element for Greg to sympathize and have friends with. It's nice that their concern was more about what will happen to the lives of her loved ones when she's gone, rather than crying over a dream that will never be fulfilled. But this Rachel needs more personal outlook than just something to help out Greg. Even as Greg's point of view, it should be more thoughtful than what is is presented.And again, much of the priority went to the style. And that's no problem at all. It makes it often visually interesting; from creative shots and sketchy imagery, it's fine to get a dose of symmetry and random stop motion. It might as well be a tribute to classic cinema since the characters have been lampooning each one of them creatively with their home sized budget. But this side isn't quite the meat of the story. I won't shame the effort and the enthusiasm of bringing a quirky personality around this atmosphere, but the story is still demanding something that should have been taken more seriously.The acting is nice; Thomas Mann manages to bring likability to a character that is tough to empathize. Olivia Cooke has proved that she has potential, but this role sadly isn't the one that would fully showcase that talent, though to be fair, this role isn't given any deeper exploration that it deserves. Same with RJ Cyler who as well could have made their bond more interesting, but there isn't much of him here either. The supporting cast such as Nick Offerman, Connie Britton, Molly Shannon, Jon Bernthal are top notch. Most of them get unexpected and even somewhat remarkable turns in their smaller roles.The best parts of Me and Earl and the Dying Girl is when it stops being pretentious and starts focusing at the bigger picture. But so little time spent in those moments kept the experience from being rewarding. I mean the craft is still admirable and it makes it more fun to explore this high school life in a different spin compared to many overly done coming-of-age cynicism film out there. But this movie handling a story that deserves attention towards its themes than its style and flavor. Style and flavor is good, but as long as it doesn't take away what should have been the heart of the story. With that said, it's still more realistic in the sense of a normal teenager than many modern mainstream coming-of-age movies out there. It's still entertaining to watch and there is still some heartfelt moments that are worth the shot. It's just it could have been more profound than this.",

            "content": "'Me and Earl and the Dying Girl' is a solid coming-of-age film - it's charming and funny and definitely not as depressing as the title may have you believe. It's a simple concept - the not-quite nerdy, not-quite cool high-schooler, Greg (Mann), is forced by his mum to hang out with a classmate who has just being diagnosed with leukaemia, Rachel (Cooke). It's starts off as an awkward friendship, but slowly turns into genuine friendship.Earl (Cyler) is great as Greg's only friend (or \"co-worker\" as he calls him) and lots of the film's fun comes from the parodies they make together of classic films - such as 'Senior Citizen Cane', 'The Seven Seals', 'A Sockwork Orange', 'Eyes Wide Butt' & my favourite, 'Grumpy Cul-de-Sacs'! - most featuring clever animation and hilarious ultra-low-budget imitations. Earl acts as Greg's conscience when he turns into a shellfish teenager and forgets about Rachel's actual problems. The parents (Shannon, Offerman & Britton) all have some great scenes.The film's score, by Brian Eno, is fantastic and really adds to the emotion, especially towards the end. The finale is handled well and shows impact we can have others' lives by just being there for them. Sure, it's sad in parts, but it's realistic and it is nice to watch how Greg and Rachel handle the situation mostly with good-humour. The funny moments outweigh the sad ones and make this an enjoyable film.",

            "content": "Well, I am not saying this grumpily, yet here's another film from 2015 which I was really looking forward to and ended up not living to its potential nor to its promise back when I heard of it in very late 2014.I really, really like the basic ground of this film. I really appreciate the ideas it is putting forwards, the context and the intentions, even though some of them are frustratingly unoriginal, but still well intended. What I don't like here is characters and execution. I think this film fails in style, tone and more importantly character empathy.It is too full of itself and it is unbearably quirky for its own good. The point is: I am not against quirky at all, look at something like \"Paper Towns\", one of my favorite movies of the year, that has loads of it in, but it works and I like it because it fits the characters it is portraying, it comes from an interesting place and becomes an integrating part of the story.In this movie is used arrogantly and it becomes a turn off on the characters. From the very start I simply kept realizing to myself I was not getting on board with this. I kept being emotionally stale and distant to all of the characters of this film and it never does some pick up so all the character beats of this film missed it for me. It was a mix that didn't work in my opinion, these characters and this tone, as I said before, it didn't match, but I believe that is not because of my personal taste, it's because truly this story doesn't lend itself to this type of telling, the characters looked out of place.That's possibly the only negative I have for the film, but it's a pretty big one when you consider that for the most part I saw simply emotionally absent from the film and didn't care about it much at all.Now of course I did get a couple of feels from it at moments, but that is both because of the subject matter, but even more so because of how well it is crafted. I have to give props to the director for the use of these long takes that I couldn't get enough of, unfortunately the world they captured and the way in which the characters moved and talked it in was really different from how the camera move. I must admit that out of personal curiosity I would really like to see a version of this film with some more editing in it, more cuts, just a more frenetic pace to the scenes. I believe that it would really lend itself tonally to how the story was being told, more.Nevertheless, I really appreciated all of the ground work the film had going for it, it was compelling to watch, but the execution really didn't pay off repeatedly and sadly so.",

            "content": "I have been meaning to write the review of Me and Earl and the Dying Girl for so long that it makes me sad to see it stand waiting for so long, in the backcloth of my mind, hungry for appreciation. It deserves adulation. It deserves your attention. My sole intent is to shower undying love for this intensely deep and touching movie that beats every convention that mainstream cinema sells us today.DIRECTION OF ME AND EARL AND THE DYING GIRL Me and Earl and the Dying Girl is a constant droll that stays beautifully supplemented by the subtle direction of Alfonso Gomez-Rejon. What you cannot certainly overlook is its extraordinary cinematography that pays attention to meticulous details at different crises. If you pay attention enough you will approve the existence of the genius behind the camera.Alfonso's frames are in a perfect sync with the flick's deadpan. Also, you are invariably smiling at the way things are shown which makes Me and Earl and the Dying Girl a propitious watch. Camera's superlative swiveling from a single axle point and such countless experimentation throughout, will make you realize how Jesse Andrews might not have been able to get a better director for this movie.Apart from stunning camera movements, the flick scores high on editing too. It stays fueled by its perfect timing for skipping frames, or throwing in a funny jest every now and then. Best ones are stop motion animation scenes that try to expound what our protagonist is thinking. It is intelligently depicted, and bides by its \"out of the box\" thinking.PLOT OF THE DYING GIRL (SPOILERS) Even though the titular flick gives away the primal plot through the moniker itself, it balances on a mere assertion to show us what might or might not happen. Me and Earl and the Dying Girl stays in the head of Greg played by Thomas Mann at all times, and depicts coming of age stuff from his perspective. We also have Earl who is Greg's best friend, played by RJ Cyler who gives a brilliant icing to the story. There are subplots to the tale that unveil as a result of an unusual setup which get superbly helmed too.It also has 21 mini movies that tell you how talented and amazing the brains behind the Me and Earl and the Dying Girl are. All of these short movies land up one way or the other inside the flick, and you can't help but reflect on your childhood dreams. You are compelled to brood over that passion of yours that could never really go anywhere.Olivia Cooke as Rachel is absolutely perfect for the role. Her eyes do most of the talking, and you can't thank the casting director enough to have chosen her. Earl doesn't disappoint either. He creates this perfect comportment to depict 'distance' whenever it was the call of the hour. Thomas Mann can't be applauded enough. His Greg brings plausibility to the tale and makes him a very promising character.FILM FOR RACHEL The final movie on Rachel is a colossal metaphor. It leaves you wondering about things that constantly float in the head of Greg. It is hard to picture someone as furled as Greg have gargantuan profundity hidden.There are images that run wild without words that try to say bazillion things to Rachel. It is Brian Eno's music, and Greg's animation that speak up abstract thoughts in a language only Rachel understands. It is so beautiful and poetic at the same time that you cannot clap enough for the writer to have thought something as eccentric as that.THE FINAL VERDICT Me and Earl and the Dying Girl is a fun frolic into the lives of Greg, Earl and Rachel. But the tragedy that awaits or doesn't, at the culmination point is going to leave your mind impassioned with emotions. A must watch!",

            "content": "Last year, I was amazed by the wonderfully emotional and powerful teen drama: The Fault In Our Stars. This film revolves around a similar premise with 'The Dying Girl', however it really goes to infinity and beyond to create one of the most incredible movie experiences I've ever seen. Stylistically and emotionally, this is a film that will amaze you in so many ways.Let's start with the main impact of this film, and that's the beautifully touching and heartbreaking story of the relationship between Rachel, a girl diagnosed with leukaemia, and Greg, a boy who reluctantly becomes good friends with her.With incredible performances by both actors, this is one of the most genuine and convincing on-screen friendships you've ever seen, and that's so significant when it comes to packing the emotional punch of the inevitable latter stages of the story, where things take a more dramatic, but still unpredictable turn.One of the most excellent parts of this film is that it's also brilliantly self-aware. It knows that many found The Fault In Our Stars cheesy, and think that this genre isn't really what it says it is. However, this uses its often more light-hearted tone to react to that stigma, and really turn the tables to create a story that will wholly enthral you no matter what your preconceptions about the genre are.In terms of the comedic tone of this film, it's also fantastic. The first half of the story is pretty much a comedy, however it's just as intelligent and fascinating as the drama is. Again, being so self-aware, this film presents itself as a quirky indie story that many hate, and while sticking to some tropes of the genre, it again subverts all of the main stereotypes to once again make something truly genuine and original, and one that will definitely stun you.Finally, this is also such an amazing film from a stylistic point of view. Not only does it fill itself with an unbelievable and powerful score, but Gomez-Rejon's directing is so original and impressive. Whether it's using an odd side-angle shot, or putting the actors through some of the longest takes you've ever seen, this is an amazing film to witness as well as experience.",

Maybe it's just me, but the main character, Greg, was a spitting image of what I was like at school. On top of this, Earl is the friend that everyone has, so the entire film settles you in for a very personal assault on your emotions.

The girl dying from cancer had a Mom who was drunk,and overly inappropriate with the girl's male friends. That was about it. She also had a weird sad face. Somewhere between drunk, and constipated. The young man wasn't likable, in fact his emotionless quips were slightly psychotic. And his parents were so odd, and one dimensional. The Dad, he always plays the same type of character in all his films, Nick somebody-- aka. Ron Swanson in a caftan. No one stood out too me at all.

            "content": "It's tough to be a teenager \u2013 and it's getting tougher. In the last few years, I've seen teenagers rebel against a society that forces them into a certain career path, some having to fight and even kill each other for food, still others run through a dangerous maze so they no longer have to live in the woods\u0085 and then, there's cancer. As good as the \"Divergent\", \"Hunger Games\" and \"Maze Runner\" movies are, nothing tugs at the heartstrings like kids with cancer. \"The Fault in Our Stars\" dramatized that very effectively, while the latest YA novel to hit the big screen, \"Me and Earl and the Dying Girl\" (PG-13, 1:45), tackles the same subject from a more light-hearted, but no less heartfelt perspective.The \"Me\" in the title is intelligent and creative, but awkward Pittsburgh high school senior Greg Gaines (Thomas Mann), who is friends with a guy named Earl (Ronald Cyler II) and Rachel (Olivia Cooke), a girl with leukemia. But Greg would hesitate to use the word \"friend\" for either Earl or Rachel. Greg's strategy for surviving high school is to be breezily acquainted with kids in each of his school's cliques, but let no one really get to know him. (Greg has serious self-esteem issues.) Earl calls Greg his friend, while the well-meaning but aloof Greg calls Earl his \"co-worker\". The two have known each other since kindergarten and bonded over their shared hobby of making admittedly awful short film versions of old movies, after altering the titles, which alters the plots. (\"A Clockwork Orange\" becomes \"A Sockwork Orange\", \"Midnight Cowboy\" becomes \"2:48 Cowboy\", \"Apocalypse Now\" becomes \"A Box Slips, Wow\", etc.) Greg only becomes friends with Rachel because his parents (Connie Britton and Nick Offerman) force him into it after they learn of Rachel's diagnosis.Rachel isn't interested in a friendship based on pity, but she is amused by Greg's quirky personality which is on full display as he gives a friendship with Rachel the old college try. Speaking of college, something else his mom nags him about is getting around to applying to college. Rachel finally convinces him to do so, and he encourages her to do the same, stubbornly optimistic about her chances for recovery. College starts to seem less likely for both of them as Rachel fights through chemotherapy and Greg virtually abandons his school responsibilities in favor of being there for Rachel.One thing Greg does that brings a smile to Rachel's face is letting his guard down enough to allow her to see his and Earl's private collection of homemade celluloid schlock. Madison (Katherine C. Hughes), Greg's high school crush, encourages him and Earl to make a film for Rachel and they agree. But this is no longer just two teenagers traipsing through the woods with a movie camera for their own amusement. This is deadly serious and none of their ideas and efforts seems appropriate or even good. Earl, Madison and a very cool history teacher (Jon Bernthal) all encourage Greg to look beyond his self-centeredness and focus on Rachel, but he's emotionally ill-equipped to deal with her declining health. The stress takes its toll, driving a wedge between him and Earl \u2013 and between him and Rachel, just when she needs him the most.\"Me and Earl and the Dying Girl\" gives a voice to typical teen angst in the 21st century, and shows us the challenges faced by typical teens who are forced to deal with issues beyond their still-developing emotional capacity. The primary voice in the movie is Greg's. He sometimes narrates the action (speaking in language a teenager would use, such as the way the movie's title is phrased). We sometimes see brief clips (animation, voice-over and live action) of what's going on in his head. As an audience, we gradually become aware that throughout the movie, we're seeing the world through Greg's eyes. The adults around him are weird in a way that seems at least partially colored by Greg's perceptions.This film is based on the book of the same name, by first-time novelist (and the film's screenwriter) Jesse Andrews, who, in his 30s, has created teenage characters more authentic than any I've seen on film in quite a while. While other YA authors have addressed issues that are important to teens, Andrews gets to the core of who they are as people. In the movie, the title characters are powerfully portrayed, but some of the adult characterizations are sloppy and the plot takes a twist that I found offensive and inappropriate. But, overall, this is a film that is entertaining, while dealing with its subject matter (mostly) respectfully and portraying modern teenagers in a way that feels quite real, even in the midst of circumstances that, to them, probably feel anything but. \"B+\"",

I guess this is probably intentional since the film deals with the gloomy topic of a \"dying girl,\" but the unsaturated colors simply made it seem boring at parts.Going back to the introduction, you should definitely see this movie if you consider yourself to be a film buff or if you like the classics. Half of the movie is either movie references or Greg and Early actually making terrible film parodies such as \"Eyes Wide Butt,\" \"The 400 Bros,\" \"A Sockwork Orange,\" and many more with hilarious titles. The sad thing is I think this reference to film is the best aspect of the film, and it barely touches on the actual story of the film.This next part is a spoiler: In my opinion, this is a very bad device the filmmakers used to make you more emotional towards the end of the film. Greg says at least twice to the audience that the \"dying girl\" doesn't die, but then she does. To me it wasn't even emotional - I'm not fed up with the fact that this was a lie, I just think this was done to make the ending sadder which was a stupid aspect.Overall it is a nice story if you're looking for something like \"The Fault in Our Stars\" but with a slightly darker tone and a lot more humor.",

Brimming with smart-ass wit, whimsical kookiness and sincere poignancy, Me and Earl and the Dying Girl goes on a trajectory straight for your heart and hits its mark.High schooler Greg (Thomas Mann), who spends most of his time making parodies of classic movies with his co-worker Earl (RJ Cyler), finds his outlook forever altered after befriending a classmate (Olivia Cooke) who has just been diagnosed with cancer.The movie blasts off the starting block with some Wes Anderson quirkiness and John Hughes on-the-pulse teenage angst, and blazes a different path. How Alfonso Gomez-Rejon establishes Greg's character in the opening scenes through weird angled shots and clever purposeful narration grabbed my heart and it wasn't let go until long after the movie has ended. Soon after that sequences of parodies of classic films splashed on the screen and I was totally sold with a big silly smile on my face - Gomez-Rejon is a film nerd, just like me.The cast in the three main roles mentioned in the namesake of the film title is awesome. Their chemistry is instantly palpable. Greg embodies the narrative voice wonderfully and I saw myself in him - he feels like an alien walking around the school compound with an adverse idea to making friends. The cafeteria to him is the living hell of cliques and factions because he is not a true member to any group but a member to every group. His best friend, nope scratch that, his partner-in-crime Earl who eats and makes parodies with him is termed as his associate because of his adverse concept of the word 'friend'. Rachel, the dying girl is the living embodiment of irony - a young girl on the cusp of a bright future but crippled with a disease that prevents that from happening. Although I must iterate that the narration does reassure us twice that she doesn't die.There are many things I like about this movie and the chief amongst them is that the two principals do not fall in love. The dialogue is well-written with an air of crisp freshness and authenticity. Just watch the scene when Greg and Rachel first spoke to each other on the stairwell. It is so spot-on witty, hits a raw nerve and yet never treads the mawkishly sentimental path of ultimate maudlin. I also love how Earl is portrayed - he is a walking conundrum but how his character arc progresses is very moving. The movie goes into tearjerker mode in the final act which by that time has earned its right for that last emotional wallop. Please bring tissue.This movie won the Grand Jury Prize and the Audience Award, the same two wins Whiplash (2014) earned before landing some big nominations at the Oscars. I wouldn't say Me and Earl and the Dying Girl is as powerful but it is simply outstanding in the way it treats a serious subject matter with such a feather-like touch and humility.",

            "review_title": "Film Review: Me and Earl and the Dying Girl",
            "content": "THIS IS THE PART THAT I BEGIN MY REVIEW AND INTRODUCE THE FILM WITH A CLEVER HOOKYou would never think that a title with the words \"dying girl\" would be the most buzzed about film at Sundance 2015, causing a bidding war that would eventually be won by Fox Searchlight Pictures for a whopping $12 million, the largest distribution purchase in the history of the fest. But alas, Me and Earl and the Dying Girl is a true testament to the power of YA pop culture, and a young adult film infused with the current obsession with cancer- driven teen fiction. Following in the footsteps of the widely popular The Fault in Our Stars and my personal favourite cancer-comedy 50/50, Me and Earl and the Dying Girl is a mix of both, with a hint of 500 Days of Summer in for good indie measure.Thankfully, Me and Earl and the Dying Girl is miles ahead of the aforementioned Stars and is easily one of the most wryly self-aware and raucously comedic films of the year.The ironic aspect of Me and Earl is that cancer has never really been at the front-row of comedy in the real world. Although it is one of the most devastating diseases of our time, consuming the lives of many loved ones, cancer, in this instance, sets up one of the most endearing and authentic cinematic friendships seen on screen, in a very long time.Now if you are all thinking, how in the hell is a film about a very pending friendship between two boys and a girl recently diagnosed with leukaemia one of the funniest and best films of the year? All I'd have to say is \"Respect the Research\" and find out for yourself.THIS IS THE PART WHERE I EXPLAIN MY COMMENTARIES ON THE FILMOne of the many (and I'm talking about a ton) charms of Me and Earl is its ability to share so many universal and relatable truths to its audience. The fact remains, Rachel Kushner (Olivia Cooke) is a seventeen-year old girl who is recently diagnosed with Leukaemia. Greg Gaines (Thomas Mann) is a smart-talking, quick responding, social leper who has serious issues with the word friendship and a great appreciation for hipster and event-garde culture (including Warhol, Herzog and B-films). Earl (RJ Cyler), the innocent by-stander in all of this, is your typical high-schooler who obsesses mostly with \"titties\". Yet, these three unique characters and the serious and lighthearted issues they face in a small Pittsburg high school offer some of the most insightful and emotional responses from an audience in the year 2015.Based on Jesse Andrews' book of the same name, the author was able to adapt his own book into a screenplay, keeping its infectious charm and wit intact. Luckily for us, Andrews' book has been described as a book made to be read by anyone; anyone who has gone to high school, anyone who has lost someone they love, or grew up with a family, or has wondered what life is all about.Directed by Alfonso Gomez-Rejon, a sophomore feature following his debut horror film The Town That Dreaded Sundown, the film blends a very inauspicious mix of quirk at first by beginning the story with an abundance of stop-motion animation, flashbacks, and some very obvious film-school favourites including; the long take; pans; and long shots. Rejon, who began his career as a personal assistant to Martin Scorsese, shows his range as a charming director who is able to not only amp up the quirk factor, but also get the best performances from his actors and characters to help narrate the story to uncontrollable moments of laughter. Much like its main character Greg (Thomas Mann) and his inability to obtain normal friendships or accept the obvious classes created in any high school setting, Rejon embraces the main essence of Andrews' novel, loss and love and stays true to its unique nerdiness, owning every second of it.THIS IS THE PART WHERE I\u0085TALKIt was the best of times, it was the worst of times, and for the most part, Me and Earl and the Dying Girl is easily one of the most satisfying films of 2015, and not for the usual ingredients that make an indie film so great either. While most indie films are applauded and hailed for their quirky soundtracks, incredible acting discoveries, and new finds, Me and Earl has an interesting quality of brining back the old, and making it cool again. Rejon, an obvious film enthusiast and lover of classics (Criterion quality to B-movie selections) sends great satisfaction of allowing his feature of reminiscing on these classic films in a fringe- type cinematic wet dream. His rehashing, mockery yet clear praise and reference to classic films shows his great admiration and love for film as a whole. While Greg and Earl half- heartedly remake some of their favourtite films, we get a clear sense of what makes them great friends, their ability to embrace their immaturity and playfulness. Rejon pulls it off through and through, that boys will be boys, while Mann and Cyler really hit that notion out of the par throughout each scene.While death is the overwhelming factor in Me and Earl and the Dying Girl, the film becomes less about death, the tragedy of loss and the morbid reality of sadness and more a remembrance of good memories, happy times, sad times, and the emotions they easily illicit to us. Rejon easily proves himself to be a mature director playing with many depths; depths with his storytelling but mostly, the wide range of depths of the emotions he so easily controls masterfully on screen between friends.",

            "content": "I was really looking forward to this movie, but at the same time I had the feeling that it was jumping upon the dying girl bandwagon. I didn't want it to be those romantic teenage drama, such as \"The Fault in Our Stars\" and \"If I Stay\", AND IT WASN'T. The whole movie has narration by the main character, Greg, and at several he acknowledges the fact that this is not a touching romantic story. But you teenage guys out there, if you need a movie to bring a date to this is the one. Skip \"Jurassic World\" and take them to a movie that they will enjoy. Now you may be complaining that you want something that's not a \"chick flick\" and this is not a chick flick. It's told from the perspective of a guy and there were multiple times where I, as a teenage guy, laughed and I looked over to see that the girls I went with didn't get it.The movie is based upon a book, as most of our good movies are, but its a different entity. The screenplay is written by the same guy who wrote the book so don't go in expecting it to be how you pictured it when you read it. I enjoyed both and you need to look at them entirely different. Now this movie is obviously an independent film. It is filmed in a different style that helps sell the awkwardness of some scenes. It reminds me of an altered Wes Anderson style that isn't so out there. It's a little distracting at the beginning but you get used to it. If you are wanting a quirky and depressing comedy, this is the movie to go to. The teenage adults in the film help carry the story along rather than stall it. And teenage boys, take a girl to this rather than \"Jurassic World\".",

            "content": "Teenagers are not innately prepared to deal with the death of a peer. Also, teenagers are sarcastic.Greg is one of these teenagers. He is marked by a self-deprecating personality and a \"just getting by\" attitude. Earl is his \"coworker,\" and they remake classic films to add to their secret collection. Greg's \"acquaintance\" Rachel is suddenly diagnosed with leukemia, and when his mom forces him to reach out, the movie takes off.Continuously entertaining, captivating, and honest. This movie is smart, witty, and heartfelt, all thanks to the three leads. I looked forward to every shot of the movie, very inventive camera-work. While there is a lesson for everyone, this movie is absolute gold for teenagers. I am a senior in high school, and I found endless relations between myself and the characters, particularly Greg. We feel like avoiding interaction is in our best interest, staying unnoticed and invisible. Beneath all of that is a self-obsessed attitude, which is evident in Greg's occasional habit of involving himself in Rachel's story. He knows that he is special and has a gift for other eyes, his movies, and yet his immaturity still holds him back. Until the end, when the bigger picture is revealed. An important, selfless message about ourselves. And at the VERY end, we are given a refreshing idea of how stuffing our faces with schoolwork and colleges may not be of utmost importance, despite parental comments. So, SO applicable.To find any fault at all, the movie occasionally felt obsessed with its individuality in an unnecessary way. However, the outrageous differences that the movie offers might model Greg's journey, as his cloud of sarcasm healthily fades in place of real, necessary emotion. 9.5/10",

First off,the cast is perfect,starting by Thomas Mann who portrays the main character on the film.This guy has got a bright future ahead of him because he is really amazing on the leading role.He nails the emotions on the more dramatic scenes and also he delivers the more funny/comedic scenes too. Olivia Cooke is also really good,as the dying girl (Rachel),and so is R.J. Cyler and truly everyone else on the movie. The camera-work is also flawless,and the direction this movie takes is something special,so props to the director and the choreographer for doing a wonderful job in here. The problem with the movie is more on the pacing,because sometimes some scenes are touching and hit at the beginning but as they go along they lose their momentum because the scene simply goes on for a little too long. Nonetheless,this movie is a hit and truly stands out in the coming of age genre that is growing every day.In my honest opinion,it is not as good as The Fault In Our Stars,but it's about the same level,and maybe even better,then Paper Towns.",

Funny, moving and wonderfully weird, it is everything a great coming of age film should be and has to be one of the best films of 2015 and of its sub genre.The screenplay was written by the author of the book this film is based off. The best book to screen adaptations are often written by the authors themselves and this film is living proof of this. The story is deeply meaningful and funny without being pretentious like some young adult coming of age films come across (*cough* Paper Towns *cough*).The direction and cinematography rip up the rule book creating unique shots that together create a spectacular vision that won Glee and American Horror Story director Alfonso Gomez-Rejon, the Grand Jury and Audience award at Sundance for the film and rightly so.The Characters in the film are great and relatable to teenagers today (well at least relatable to me). My only critique for the film being that I would have liked to see more of Earl as he is one of if not the funniest character in the film, being a man of few words, Dem Tities. Also the film is called me and EARL and the dying girl so I would have expected a bit more screen time for a character who has top billing.Overall Me and Earl and the Dying Girl is a near perfect movie, a film that will make you laugh as well as cry from its experimental opening to its heart breaking/ warming ending. I highly recommend you watch this film as it is a modern master piece and to me goes down as one of my personal favourite films",

I advise you, not to expect much out of it, so you don't get frustrated, but I can say it's an overall above average movie. This film deals with loss, particularly, losing people to diseases like cancer. The film is an admixture of ludicrousness and melancholy which is super hard to be done, On the positive side, I feel elated now that I've watched this as it had a lot of real-life events going on. The filming photography was marvelous, and the overall visual effect made this amusing to watch (colors, camera angles, editing) not to mention the carved pieces of art. Thomas Mann perfectly played his role by doing a fascinating character with a reluctance to be a real friend with anyone except for Earl he is a socially awkward teenager with a quirky personality; on the other hand, Olivia Cooke was even better; I believe that's due to her wistful facial features I was convinced she is a cancer patient. Furthermore, the movie touches upon many common topics like fitting in school and applying to college, and all the pressure that come with that, like anxiety and self-loathing, but there is a lot to like in the way Mann comes to realize that he is not quite as defeatist as he once thought gives you the sense of self-discovering while being attached to people. Given the key themes of terminal illness and death, I reckon the tenor of the scenario has been clear, it was not to let yourself detached from social life no matter how hard it gets.",

Long uninterrupted shots of their interactions makes for a compelling progression of their friendship that doesn't try to force romance as we see a genuine take on a friendship that was forcefully began but bloomed due to their unique similarities and context.Having watched this movie 4 times now at very different ages, it seems to be relatable at different stages of my life.

He is a misfit who carefully navigates his way through each of his school's student groups without standing out. He and his best friend Earl spend most of their time making parody films together (list of parody films and obvious spoilers). One day, he learns from his mother that his childhood friend, Rachel, is diagnosed with acute myelogenous leukemia. His mother forces him to try to spend time with her to make her feel better. The two have an awkward start to their new friendship with neither seemingly wanting each other's company but it eventually grows and develops as she begins to fall for his quirky personality. The film primarily serves as his story of how he spends his time with Rachel and thus it is told from his perspective and he narrates it.This film is a coming-of-age story as he deals with his last year of high school and decides what he wants to do about his future while living with his overbearing parents and hanging out and making films with his best friend. The film covers a lot of subject matter, it's a high school comedy, it's a drama, and it's an experimental film all in one and it does them all very well. It explores high school social structure in a smart and original way that everyone would expect that reminded me of when I went to high school (jocks, nerds, geeks, goths, etc). The film does a great job of not sensationalizing terminal illness as it is just the secondary or even tertiary plot line and the film's treatment of her friendship with Greg is both darkly funny and realistically bleak. The bulk of it focuses on Greg's relationships either with Rachel, Earl, his parents or with Earl and his history teacher, Mr. McCarthy. The writing and execution is elite quality. Each character seem are grounded and depicted realistically. Parent and child relationships and peer relationships all are captured in humorous and touching ways. The dramatic elements of the film don't come across as clich\u00e9 or cheesy thanks to the acting and the writing that I've previously mentioned. I applaud the imagination involved in the parody films which Greg and Earl make as they are cheesy, funny, and full of charm with the purposefully bad acting and some nice stop-motion animation. This comes from the fact that they make them by themselves with the smallest of budgets. I would definitely not mind if they could be released in any form, maybe online. The actor who plays Greg, Thomas Mann, definitely carries this film with his performance and I was pleasantly surprised seeing that I have not heard of him before (quick IMDb search). The three main actors had excellent chemistry together on top of the original script kept me laughing and entertained for most of the film. For those who may be unsure, this not one of those pretentious YA book-based movies. It is a smartly written, well acted film and is one of the best films of the year.keithlovesmovies.com",

I found it to be a very strong story and the structure of the plot was well laid out. It's been quite a while since I've seen a movie that had me so involved with the characters lives and world that sometimes I forgot I was watching a film. I found the humor very pleasing with a realistic feeling. At times catching me off guard and abruptly laughing out loud (sometimes very loud:) the actors did a tremendous job! The relationship between both main characters was heart warming and complicated and I found the comedic relief from supporting actor RJ Cyler a perfect trio. The only thing stopping me from giving this movie a 10 is the cinematography in the beginning. No complaints about the muted colors but there were a few scenes where I found it to be too wide of a lens which distracted me overall, along with interesting choice of landscape to portrait to landscape transition from one location to another. I commend and respect director of photography Chung-hoon Chung for doing something different. But to me I found it a bit odd. Also, I like the use of distance used between both Rachel and Greg in the beginning of the movie but I felt that shots where they were to far apart was overdone. I do understand the visual metaphor of the relationships between the characters and I think that it was used well. I just felt that it could have been used a little less. But overall those were very minor for me in an otherwise great movie! Hence the 9 star rating!",

But the ending kept me from enjoying it as much as I would have otherwise. Based on Greg's denials in the narration, I was hoping that Me and Earl would break the mold and actually allow the \"dying\" girl to live. After all, the survival rate for childhood leukemia is in the high 90s! But no, in the end the movie reverts back to all the usual dying girl clich\u00e9s, especially during the overwrought final video scene.In my opinion, using an unreliable narrator in this case was a cheap trick. Yes, I know that there are lots of unreliable narrators like Greg in fiction, The Life of Pi being a famous example. But most unreliable narrators are either immature, mentally ill, or mentally handicapped, or they have some really strong reason for lying to the audience (for example, to cover up a crime or to make a central point as in The Life of Pi). It also bothered me that the screenwriter never gave Greg the opportunity to tell Rachel how he really felt. I thought it was going to happen in the final video, but it didn't.",

It stars Thomas Mann, Olivia Cooke, and RJ Cyler along with Nick Offerman, Molly Shannon, and Katherine C. Hughes.This movie revolves around Greg(Thomas Mann), a high schooler whose quest is to stay as secluded as possible and amateur film director, as he befriends a cancer ridden girl, Rachel(Olivia Cooke). This leads him and his best friend Earl(RJ Cyler) to make a film for Rachel.I love this movie. It was amazing! Those seven word usually don't get said when I talk about a Coming-of-age tale. Most are either too dramatic or too uninteresting. This movie found its footing from the first one minute with the opening gag. This is amazing considering how badly the setup could've gone if done poorly but instead it was short and sweet. As the opening scene fades we are treated fine performances across the board. Nick Offerman, Molly Shannon and Katherine C. Hughes give great performances that add so much depth to the movie. Thomas Mann offers possibly the best performance of his career as he demonstrates all of Greg's vulnerabilities and strengths without making him too weak of a character or too strong of a character. Though Mann was excellent two people completely outshine him. RJ Cyler delivers an awe inspiring performance as Earl even though he barely speaks throughout the movie runtime. But the best performance by a long shot was Olivia Cooke. Cooke's portrayal as Rachel is beautiful, depressing, uplifting and overall masterful. She doesn't try to be a tearjerker but with that stated it hard not to tear up at her performance. Moving away from the performances lies the writing. The direction was fine but the writing had something to it. After I finished watching it I went home and checked who wrote it and to my surprise it was Jessie Andrews, writer of the book. One can really tell something is different about the movie from the start, a little more care is placed into it than other teen movies. Overall this is in my top three best movie of the year and I'm not sure how many more movie I can say that about. I implore you go see this movie! Me and Earl and the Dying girl Gets an A or a 9/10",

Socially awkward, anxiety ridden and self loathing to a fault. He's the outsider, preferring to remain invisible by refraining from any significant relationships with people. Greg is the outsider most of us probably were at one point or another, and he likes to keep it that way.Enter Rachel (Olivia Cooke), the dying girl.Rachel's been diagnosed with leukemia, so Greg's mom forces him to spend some time with her. It will be a \"nice thing\", she says.Of course, Greg has no desire to hang out with a stranger while Rachel has no interest in attaining pity from anyone. They hang out anyway to appease their parents, and end up forming an unlikely friendship that develops wonderfully in ways you might not expect.And yes this all sounds like every single coming of age story we've seen, but its been gifted with terrific performances by both Mann and Cooke that lend real heart and authenticity to their characters. This is also not a manipulative tearjerker Ala \"The Fault In Our Stars\", where the boy falls madly in love with a girl and ends up in a tragic romance.Instead of diving into a bowl of generic angst, our heroines face it head on with off kilter, deadpan humor. The result is a film that feels refreshingly real, striking a fantastic balance between its hilariously off beat characters and earnest drama. Its the best Wes Anderson movie Wes Anderson never directed, and i unabashedly love it.So I could sit here and tell you how poignant the film is, how its funny and heartfelt all at the same time. How its one of the best films of the year. But how boring would that be? I would be doing the film a disservice by spoiling its moments. Like most films, it has to be seen to be understood.Yes, coming of age stories are a dime a dozen these days. But every once in a blue moon, a movie like \"Me and Earl and the Dying Girl\" comes along to remind us how powerful and affecting movies can be. So if you haven't already, please give this one a shot. It might just become a new favorite of yours.",

There's Greg & his best friend Earl, your regular trying- to-survive high school kids, who are captivated by old movies and shooting short- film re-enactments of their favorite scenes. There's Mr McCarthy, almost a farther like figure to Greg & Earl, a brutal hipster looking English teacher who lets them hide and watch movies in his office. And then There's Rachel, an innocent girl who is set to pass away, way to soon. Or is she? In it's essence, Me and Earl and The Dying girl is a sweet, sincere and brutally honest portrayal of a coming of age teenager, who has to deal with something that no one quite knows how to handle. We see Greg in constant denial, unable to deal with the fact that Rachel is most likely going to pass away. He is even unable to tell us, the viewers, that this is what will happen. Alfonso Gomez-Rejon lets us watch a big share of this movie through a lens of optimism by specifically stating that Rachel will get better. Thus we take our guard down, letting ourselves really indulge and start deeply caring for Rachel. This is in no way a suspense move in a way to spear the viewer from crying for a 100 minutes. It is genuinely a state of mind that any teenager of Greg's age would have in a similar situation. Any human maybe. It is in our nature to hope for the best, constantly. Greg heroically and willingly becomes a friend to Rachel, he genuinely thinks that she will get better, even during her last moments. However this turn of events also makes us pay attention to small details, that otherwise would have been ingrained in trying to cope with a death of a teenager. We deeply analyze how hard this situation is for Rachel's mother, we can focus more on the relationship between Earl and Greg as well as nostalgically listen to Mr McCarthy's life stories and lessons. Alfonso Gomez-Rejon began his career as personal assistant to Martin Scorsese, Nora Ephron, Robert De Niro and Alejandro Gonzalez Inarritu. One can really notice Innaritu in this picture, especially towards the end, during long patient scenes of Greg and Rachel coupled with moody sound scores from Greg's short-film. Rejon does a wonderful job. The film is truly funny, heartbreaking and human.In watching Greg's last short film, along with Greg and Rachel, we realize just how meaningless life truly is, that in it's nature, it is a simple compilation of frames and sounds. Rachel's death still comes as a slight shock to the viewer, just like it did to Greg. We, too, had hoped that a miracle will happen any minute, even as evidence increasingly suggested otherwise.Throughout his journey, Greg will learn how to make compromises, learn to care about someone, make new friends, lose existing ones and finally experience an inevitable loss of someone he loved. All of these events will undoubtedly 'shape' Greg as a human being, as he will swear never to forget Rachel, The dying girl.",

            "content": "This movie was a pleasant surprise, and a much stronger offering than much of the dreck floating about these days. The movie starts with Greg, a senior high schooler who has a love for film, explaining how he keeps such a low profile that he belongs to no \"groups\" commonly found in high school - jocks, nerds, goths, etc. The downside of his low profile is an almost complete lack of friends, the one exception being his colleague in film - Earl. Greg's mom \"forces\" him to hang out with Rachel, who has been diagnosed with leukemia (what flavour we never learn), and what begins as an obligation soon turns into the focus of his life. Alongside all the teenage drama we are treated to the parody movies that Greg and Earl make, some of which are quite humorous, others just blah. Still, the film-making shows Greg and Earl are actually artistes who have emotions that run deep, and they are not the non- participants in life that they originally seem. A problem the movie suffers is this paradox - Greg is at once a hyper-deep, emotional boy and a clueless, shallow buffoon. His petty, unfeeling actions when he learns that Rachel has decided to die are out of character. It's as though he hasn't witnessed her struggle and pain throughout months of treatment. His heartless dismissal of her at her time of need makes him much less likable and hard to relate to - does he not realize this is her decision and is he not a true friend? Anyhow, there is some ham-fisted over acting and some really garbage \"art films\" complete with black and white slow motion smiling, tears rolling, stop motion, etc. that make the viewer want to stop watching (even though we understand these are DEEP, EMOTIONAL, ARTISTIC films). Despite this the movie succeeds, and Greg emerges on the other side of Rachel's death as a better person, who understands her better. He keeps learning about her after her death, which is the main premise of the film - as he still learns about her, his relationship with her grows, showing us the viewer that death is not the end. The movie treats Earl almost as an after-thought, and both the character and actor deserve more. Likewise Greg's parents and teachers. Anyhow, Olivia Cooke does a great job and the film succeeds largely on the strength of her. Not a masterpiece, but quite good and worth a watch.",

The places, semiology, plans, settings and everything else is nostalgic in fact, just like trying to show us the intellectual and numb situation of the youth in America is predominant except the ignorant and numb majority of them. As I mentioned the texture including the 90's or 80's waves in it, the depiction of intellectuality of the teenagers and their awareness of human relationships even if they are senseless, could have been possibly shot only by these nostalgic waves considering today's world's teenage attractions based on the popular culture.The movie's movement towards to cult and classic Hollywood films especially in a perspective of the interest of young people, gives the parents and the youth hope for their future responsibility capacities. The context of the movie ironically and secretly reveals the semiology that some idiotic reality shows or senseless social media-based relationships does exist dominantly especially in the pop-culture teenage world. But the clear message is somehow teenagers who have troubled social life is just and illusion, it's and will naturally be very easy to break their robotic acts just like every one of us lived this course by attending to real life relationships full of heartbreaks, deaths, illnesses or maybe separations with our beloved ones.The movie's another interesting component besides the texture of nostalgia, beautiful editing or direction of photography and etc. is the script's purity which was ornate with teenagers' humoristic and glimpsing dialogues, acts and the pure sufferings in their adulthood process in a mixture of beautiful eclectic way. Just like adulthood process living a teenage boy or a girl.My empathy when I was coming to the end has raised time by time and my thinkings of what if all these happened to me in young age, terrified me and to be honest I have considered myself lucky for not becoming a responsible adult in a strict rapid process. Maybe these young hearts' lives reminded me my short films that I shot at the age of 14 in the influence of the other classic and cult films in an humoristic way just like they do in the film.And I also admit that the Midnight Cowboy re-make scene caused the double feel down effect to me both by this movie's scene and the first time I watched the Midnight Cowboy when I was at their age.The movie has satisfied me in every way. I recommend you for just going back to your school times with a wave of nostalgia, and to emphasize today's kids complications of life with lot more responsibility and to see how they live short term childhood by the forcement of the tragedies or responsibilities imposed to them whether they want to or don't want to.",

            "content": "Me and Earl and the Dying Girl is the 2015 Grand Jury prize winner from the Sundance Film Festival. It follows in the steps of Whiplash which won the 2014 Grand Jury prize. It follows the story of Greg (Thomas Mann) who is forced by his mother (Connie Britton) to become friends with a girl from his school, Rachel (Olivia Cooke) after she is diagnosed with cancer. Greg is joined by his \"co-worker\" Earl (RJ Cyler) to create a film for Rachel to \"do something good for her\". The first thing to note is the comedy in the movie. Considering it says \"Dying Girl\" in the title, you'd expect and be okay if it employed a sadder register for the entirety of the movie. But it leaves the whole sad portion for the third act of the film. It rides the thin line of being quirky without being irksome which is important because of the tendency for indie-inflected films to become quite snobby for the most part. The stand out performance is of the character of Earl by RJ Cyler. A relative unknown, he is by far the funniest part of the film even though the film takes a focus on Greg and tells the story from his point of view. However, I would've liked it much better had Earl had the bigger role in the movie over Greg, as Greg's character is something that has been seen in other films in the past. The performance of Rachel by Olivia Cooke was very heartfelt and was a performance that you would connect to if you've ever known someone to have befallen due to cancer. Her initial response to her diagnosis is a very \"teen\" response where she's like \"whatever\". But as the plot progresses and her health deteriorates, Rachel isn't afraid to voice her displeasure with the disease and the people around her as well. A great little gag in the movie are the parody films having play-on titles based on the classic films of all time. For example, A Sockwork Orange for A clockwork Orange etc. For any cinephile out there, it's something to be appreciated even if those movies \"sucked\", in the protagonist's words. Because of the plot, there is a very easy comparison to be made with the 2014 young adult film \"The Fault in our Stars\". However, the register for this film is very \"I hate people\" in a funny way and the central relationship between Me and Earl and the Dying Girl is what grounds the movie. This movie passes and graduates high school and gets a B+.",

But the specific objective of the director is crystal clear: \"let's make a high school film that doesn't fall into the romantic or comedy genre\" even when there are temptations to sway it to either side. And the result is a slowly-paced, at-times-boring-film that you only begin to appreciate when you realize the initial reason for the build up-especially in the last thirty minutes. Thomas Mann who plays Greg makes up for an interesting character when we meet him in the film: keeping a low key by avoiding publicity stunts and blending in into every caucus. But however important, somehow self-centred and alone he is, his development and significance to the plot of the film comes as a result of his forced meeting with the \"dying girl\". I saw a review which compared the film to 2014's \"The Fault in our Stars\". True, in the sense there are similar themes between the two films: the part about a character who is suffering from a terminal disease. But I can also remember going into 30 minutes in this film and saying to myself: Oh! this looks like \"The perks of being a wall flower\" when looking at it from an angle that there aren't much cheerful moments in this film. The characters are either sad or wallow in self pity. And even characters like Earl, where nothing much is revealed about him, he still carries this posture of having issues. The most touching scenes in the film come during Jon Bernthal's one minute speech about learning more about a person after they are dead than when they are alive. Entertainment wise, this film fails. Audience looking for thrills and sporadic twists should avoid this. It is boring, very. But the affirmative of the film are the camera work, the off-beat milieu in suburban Pittsburgh- the faded cinematography also. All the above characteristics aim to some way resemble (Birdman)- considering that both main characters are film makers. Finally, the most important thing I see myself liking about this film is the character development of the main character Greg. The film starts with him writing a book and the chapters of that book are laid out in chapters for the whole film. Interestingly, each chapter serves as a learning opportunity for Greg. And though the director bypasses how he puts that learning experience to use. Still, there is this lingering feeling that his experiences are going to be in important tool in his life making decisions. Moreover, the human-to-human interactions are natural-highlighting on the highs and lows of everyday relationship. And though one of those interactions is with the \"dying girl\" (played by Olivia Cooke)-zero attempts are made to make us feel pity for her.",

Many unique camera angles and intimate shots. I just loved the overall feel during the movie, and was left with a feeling of peace once it was finished. I truly enjoyed and highly recommend.",

Keeping a sad story so light and humerus is very challenging but this film I thought blended it so well together with excellent performances with the main characters of Thomas Mann as Greg, RJ Cyler as Earl and Olivia Cooke as Rachel. There was great chemistry between the cast and loved the relationship they develop over time. The plot of making friends with a dying girl would not be very upbeat and uplifting but the way it was carried out was very well done. The cinematography of the film was amazing to watch every shot and transition was perfect an really appreciated the way it was filmed. This was something I would look to use in my future with filming.I did like the narration on the film but however I think it did give away some plot points or made you think about the ending way too soon even though some of it was to mislead you. I would of preferred it to be more just kept to how the film plays out. There are many young adult films out there with similar stories like fault in our stars for instance but this film is up there with the top of them for sure. This film should get recognition through awards but the film is great and more people should go see it!",

            "content": "I honestly didn't think this would happen. A film, based on a teen romance book, about a girl with cancer, managed to be original and heartwarming. Now, I was sort of aware of this film before it came out. It was a huge sundance hit, and I believe I saw one trailer. I recall being extremely underwhelmed. However, director Alfonso Gomez-Rejon has crafted something that is much more than a romance or a high school movie. It's a tender salute to classic foreign cinema with enough compelling and quirky characters to make a Wes Anderson movie jealous. Greg(Thomas Mann) is a regular high-school kid, with odd parents and no real ambitions in life. He makes stop-motion films with his friend Earl(RJ Cycler) all around the town. They are all purposely crappy riffs on classics. From Breatheless to Clockwork Orange to Apocalypse Now, these stop-motion films are fantastic, and every time I caught a glimpse of one I found myself smiling from ear to ear. Whoever designed these(and the various other stop motion stuff we see in the film) deserves a bonus. Anyway, Greg's life is turned upside down when he meets Rachel(Olivia Cooke) who has cancer. He grows close to her, and soon he is trying to make a film for has a gift. The stars chemistry is solid, and in a great scene, he writes his college application as Werner Herzog. The film's depiction of high school is also refreshing. Sure there's the generic \"teen movie voice-over\" but the film doesn't try to \"tell it like it is.\" It allows itself to be over-the-top. Because of this, it feels more real than most films of this nature. Overall though, the romance is definitely the weakest link because we've seen it all before. Luckily, the filmmakers know this. The direction definitely isn't perfect. There's a couple abrupt changes in tone, and Rejon's camera movements(brought over from American Horror Story) can get a little nauseating. However, Rejon has used a stale genre to create a completely unique filmgoing experience. That's a feat that deserves praise.",

Upon learning that Rachel has contracted leukaemia, Greg's mother (Connie Britton) forces him to spend time with Rachel, the two soon begin to bond and become friends, a friendship that goes deeper once Earl introduces Rachel to their amateur films and the duo are persuaded to make a film for her. The emotional core of this film is really in the chemistry of the two leads, Thomas Mann and Olivia Cooke, two relative up and comers who deliver pitch perfect performances and really help to keep the film entertaining in it's many humorous moments but also hit the right dramatic notes when the film begins to tug on the heartstrings.Full credit to screenwriter Jesse Andrews (who also wrote the novel this film is based on) for crafting a story so charming and heartfelt that you cannot help but feel connected in and drawn to these characters. The dialogue is witty and clever whilst never falling into clich\u00e9s, rather it remains very self aware, especially during Greg's numerous (and hilarious) monologues. There is something so real and natural about the script that really enable us as the audience to fully become immersed in the film and it's world.Props as well to the rest of the ensemble; RJ Cyler, Connie Britton, Nick Offerman, Molly Shannon, Jon Bernthal and Katherine C. Hughes all deliver truly wonderful performances alongside Mann and Cooke whilst never feeling like they are being completely overshadowed by the two leads.The film is beautifully shot with some extremely clever shots and camera movements, think Wes Anderson style cinematography! The score/soundtrack matches every scene beautifully and never feels unnatural in any way, it really helps to craft the beauty of many scenes and also help set the tone perfectly.But when you get right down to it, the film really is about one thing; friendship. The joy of having friends and having people to spend your time with and talk to about life and it's many struggles, and trust me - there are some truly heartbreaking struggles for the characters, the title of the film alone makes that pretty clear. This is a truly beautiful little film that is equal parts sad and uplifting. Storytelling at its most beautiful.",

Well done.Interesting that there were no teens in the theater...only adults who clearly all loved the film. Teens, who paid attention, could benefit from the ideas in this film for sure.

Especially when he dropped over a third of his body weight and lost all his hair, there was a definite elephant in the room. He didn't want to talk about it, it occupies every waking moment of his life. I didn't want to talk about it, its beyond uncomfortable. So what did we do. We had our stupid jokes that few people would get and only we could laugh at. Some in poor taste (geez, you got out of the history final? How long are you going to keep milking the cancer card?) but exactly the sort of thing that makes us (him most of all) laugh our asses off.This is the power of this film. These characters act like real teenagers. When faced with an unspeakable horror, they deal with it. They don't deal with it all that well but how many kids their age do you know that actually would? How many adults handle the big c maturely? Its a film with a quirky style and that might be a little off putting at first but you just have to embrace it.

            "content": "I have felt a strong repulsion against cancer movies since the term \"cancer movie\" came out, probably even before. It always seems that they only have the purpose to make you cry through an unrealistic depiction of terminal illness (yes, you always die of cancer in movies), gilding the pill about all the disgusting aspects of it, the ones that would tax every character's bravery and good humour, the ones that probably would make you hate more the illness itself than death. Unfortunately Me, Earl and the Dying Girl doesn't escape totally this judgment.Of course my review is globally positive: I enjoyed watching the most of it, it makes me laugh and it would probably make me cry if only I cried for this kind of movies. Nevertheless I have found in it the same flaws that all these stories always have and an additional presumption to have done something very original; but probably I should blame the book for that, not the script.The non-romantic relationship between the main character and the sick girl isn't enough to make the plot original or more realistic, and the continuous pointing it out as something different was really pretentious and annoying. Actually I didn't really like the main character either. He wasn't young enough to justify his lack of maturity and sensitiveness, and I think the movie failed in showing that there was something interesting and complex in his personality: he was invisible and anonymous even at the end of the movie, and that really made me think he had had good reasons to act that apathetic at the beginning.However probably a different ending would help. In this kind of movies it seems that you can't really escape death if you are a cancer patient, but that hasn't been true anymore for many decades. Conveying the message that cancer is always terminal, besides being utterly unrealistic, definitely won't help cancer patients and the ones who have to take care of them. Moreover letting sometimes survive the sick character wouldn't compromise the personal growth of people around them: I think that the hardest part in these situations is facing illness itself, not coping with the eventual death.",

As someone who has read the book I can confirm that this is much better than book. Not that the book wasn't also good because it was. It managed to fix all the problems I had with the book and more. So why am I praising this movie so much? There are plenty of reasons. So let's start with how perfectly cast this movie is. You don't even to read the book to see how perfect this actors are for these roles. Not only that but the performances are absolutely fantastic. They are extremely believable and convincing. They are all great but, Olivia cooks performance is easily the greatest. Just look at the scene where she is dying and she is able to convey so much emotion just using her eyes. Anybody can just scream and cry out of joy but what she was able to convey just with a gaze is amazing. This movie is very funny and also very dramatic and this film does both equally good. This movie also is beautifully scripted. Every scene makes sense and works in multiple ways. They flow right into each other. The cinematography is a very underrated thing about this movie. It's really great and very clever at times. The soundtrack is fantastic as well. All the songs perfectly match the scenes their accommodated with. Really makes you wonder why beautiful Brian Eno songs haven't been used in many other films. The fact that is masterpiece has less than an 8 on this website really ticks me off.

It is also a film filled with the right blend of comedy.Me and Earl and the Dying Girl stars Thomas Mann, RJ Cyler, and Oliva Cooke. Gregg (Mann) and Earl (Cyler) are friends who make films with each other, that are parody's of classic films like Sockwork Orange. When Rachel (Cooke) suffers from Leukemia. Greg's mother, played by Connie Britton, and father, played by Nick Offerman, make him go to Rachel's house to keep her company, Greg and Rachel make a bond that includes some of the best chemistry in film. The film does a great job making you feel for the characters. Later on in the friendship, a friend known as Madison (or semi-friend, however Greg puts it in the film), wanted Greg and Earl to make a film for Rachel, and after Rachel fins out about the film from Earl (which she tells Greg she found out), they fight and Greg and Earl fight. Greg's life is turned upside down because of it. After a fight in the cafeteria, Earl helps Greg and the two, more-or-less, stop hating each other and Madison, after the three (not Madison, the guy who fought Greg) are forced to leave school grounds, Madison feels bad for pressuring Greg about the film and asks him to prom. He accepts the offer. On the day of prom, Greg has a finished film for Rachel, who is now at the final stage of her cancer (which was spoken of earlier in the film, almost directly after the scene where Rachel and Greg fight). As Greg shows her the film, she goes into the final stage of her life, and goes into a coma. Greg freaks out and bursts into tears and leaves the room. It is found out seconds later that she died after 10 hours of being in a coma. Rachel's mom, played by Molly Shannon, shows Greg a card that re-submitted him into college, which shows that it is in Pittsburgh. He, earlier, submitted a form for the university and was inducted, but was ejected because of the declining of his school work, because he was with Rachael, doing a good deed. He also finds a book that was cut with scissors to make a replica of the day when the three leads were eating ice cream on a staircase, which was also the day Greg and Earl got stoned (accidentally) got stoned/high by eating cookies. She also leaves a letter that he can have some pillows (the first day they started talking, they talked about the pillows in her room. The film ends there.The film is easily one of, if not, the best film of 2015. IT should be watched by all since it has the emotion and the heart. It is a great, great film and I recommend it to all.What do you think of it?",

I highly recommend it! Me and Earl and the Dying Girl centers around Greg (Thomas Mann; Project X), a senior who has managed to coast through high school without associating himself with any cliques or making any enemies, yet at same time keeping himself closed off from forming any true bonds. Except with, one of his teachers & his \"Co-Worker\" Earl. Together Greg & Earl spend their free time making parodies of weird foreign films for their amusement.When Greg's mother learns that one of his classmates has been diagnosed with cancer, she forces him to go over to her house and befriend the girl. Though he hesitates at first, what starts off as something he was forced to do, becomes the beginning of a beautiful friendship with Rachel (Olivia Cooke, Bates Motel) All the characters are superbly cast and each give one gives an absolutely solid performance. They appeared to be a really tight-knit cast, that just worked brilliantly. I especially enjoyed Nick Offerman's portrayal as Greg's dad, what an eccentric oddball of a parent; he adds a fun unique weirdness to the story. Thomas Mann is fantastic! I have enjoyed watching him in other films. I think he is someone that will have a long and successful career. He is definitely a very charismatic actor A lot of people are comparing this to \"The Fault in Our Stars\". I get that; but this movie is far more fresh, quirky & original. It's written so beautifully, and shows how life-changing strong friendships can be & how they can alter your outlook on life. The movie deals with a terminal illness in such a heartfelt way. It is definitely worth watching",

            "content": "No Spoilers, Please enjoy.I always wondered what it would like to see a masterpiece where others did not. As I was sitting in the theater at the close of this film I saw a few groups of teenagers who had bought the ticket and taken the ride looking confused, bored, and eager to return to their smartphones. And so with that, I, with a heavy heart, do not recommend this film to everyone and that just makes be bitter to be an American. Now, the film itself is really two films in one. The first a comedy. The second, I don't know what but call it something magnificent and full of real blood pumping from a real heart and made me take a real minute to sort out how I was living my life. I almost died once, in a hospital. I was at the time scared and lonely and mean. This movie rehashed that experience for me in a way that can only be described as through a lens of emotional maturation, if you can follow me. I am now stronger in the broken places, as Hemingway would say. It is because of brave filmmakers who brave the bullshiting critics and the greedy consumers and blast away all the superficial scum that piles up on us all in this all-too-fast all- to-now all-to-much place we wander through between the partnered miracles of life and death. The main character, Greg, began the film as a smooth talking, hilarious and universally accepting kid, wonderfully unbelievable but entertainingly played by Thomas Mann who makes his way through the plot of this sharp film by being a kid who has to grow up quick when facing truly adult emotions like regret and sacrifice and ending up... well, ending up... It is always an on-going process, this ending thing we do, isn't it? His life wasn't finished at the end of the film so I hope for him, like any real person outside of cinema to keep living and keep growing, smiling whenever possible, crying when necessary, never losing a lesson learned.The black guys in this film were almost psychically reading the repressed thoughts of the white people around them. Very refreshing.Greg's categorization of everyone in his high school into sub-groups was a very egalitarian way of think of the social order of any social hodge podge. Every group complete separate from one another but equal. (I worry that's what Southern whites said about segregation but I'll apologize and move on). Much improved over the very old and very elitist socio-economic structuring that most high schoolers nowadays do semi-consciouslly as their parents did before them and their parents before them.The directing... impeccable. The screenplay... superb. The acting... touching and genuine. (Those last remarks were a joke. If you don't get it I wish I could explain it.)I titled this review \"An Epic Mosaic of the Emotions, both the Painful and the Good\" because whenever i watch The Wolf of Wall Street, a favorite, I always feel I have to watch another film to balance out all the riotous pleasure with some pain. Pain is good and there are few better environments to experience it than a movie theater. This film was massive in the range of emotions yet balanced, making me feel that this was maybe the most complete film I have ever seen if you'll agree with me in my criteria for completeness being based upon the \"number\" of emotions a film can authentically and sincerely hit upon without running four hours. I was once handed a list of emotions on paper by someone who wanted to help, more than a hundred listed, but they were just words and so is this review... So see the film, I can't recommend to to anyone who reads this whole review more highly.Darn, darn, darn the movie was over and I had learned something from it. I learned that death is not the end of somebodies life, that you don't have to talk like a genius to have the heart of a poet, that Molly Shannon can really, really act, that it's never too late to start loving someone and its childish to hold a grudge, that things don't necessarily have to ever get better but you're always free to let the sunshine pour in, that a theater is a dark place full of bright things, that love does not make sense and will never do so, that we are all not created equal because some of us sit in theaters and stare at the pretty colors while others are out there in the world making Me, Earl, and the Dying Girl.

The thing that caught me off guard with this was the misdirection of it making you think the cheesy/predictable thing would happen but then surprises you.The only negative I can think of is that it can feel slow and depressing at times but with a film about cancer what do you expect. This film is definitely worth the watch If you like the indie film, coming of age, crying alone at 2am kind of vibe you might be getting from the trailer.",

He manages to approach an obscure subject such as death in a very humane and warm way, among other characters like how tough it actually is to grow up, and how really complicated human interaction is. The movie keeps you interested, it moves you and touches some very delicate fibers in the way. It has a smart script, with understandable dialogue and relatable characters that, thank God, have more than one dimension. I find the acting to be superb, specially the acting performed by Thomas Mann, R.J. Cyler and Olivia Cooke, the young actors that play the principal characters of the film. They will make you laugh and cry. It also made me very happy that there's no unnecessary drama, just very human reactions to very human problems. I feel it has some sort of Little-Miss-Sunshine/Juno feel to it, feeling just so intimate and natural, giving it some realness that most of us are craving for. Getting a bit techy, I must say I find the film's cinematography to be very simple and pretty. It has a Wes-Anderson-y feel to it, still being very down-to-Earth. On top of that, it has amazing music that goes with it; mellow and soft, but never corny. It also has very decent editing. All in all, I very much recommend it.

            "content": "Greg (Thomas Mann) is a fairly typical high school boy with passion for old movies and the creation of new ones, and like many film makers, he prefers to observe people instead of growing attached to them. His best friend is Earl (wonderfully played by RJ Cyler) whom he describes as \"more like a coworker than a friend\" and otherwise he isolates himself and creates new films he never shows anyone. At his mother's insistence, he begins visiting Rachel (Olivia Cook) who has been diagnosed with leukemia. Though initially reluctant, Greg begins to genuinely look forward to hanging out with her, which challenges his desire to remain a neutral force in other people's lives. The first ten minutes of the film are stiff and awkward and trapped in teen movie hell, but it's supposed to be that way, so hang in there. The strange beauty of the film comes from the authenticity of the characters, and the brilliant portrayal of the complexities of terminal illness. In most movies you're forced to endure a sick person who essentially becomes Yoda for everyone in their lives, offering wisdom and guidance and poetry and a few well-timed coughs before they sputter away to the sobs and wails of everyone around them. This movie shows what cancer truly is: miserable, with a lot of people offering ridiculous canned sentiment over and over again, who only want to make themselves feel better about what they're witnessing. It also brilliant captures what people miss about others when they remain guarded and unobservant of what lies beyond surface examination -- or remain too preoccupied of what others think of them to realize that other people are thinking about a whole lot of different things -- not them. It manages to do this without being so heavy-handed about it that a hallmark sentiment hatches on your face, and your eyes roll out of your head to escape it. Jesse Andrews pulled off a gorgeous book and screenplay, and Alfonso Gomez-Rejon also deserves props for graceful direction and imagination. Every character is given room to be unique and fully-formed, and retains their humanity to the very end. I was very reluctant to watch this film, out of fear of watching a cancer spectacle similar to the overwrought emotional farming that has taken place a lot over the past ten years, but this is a different film all together. Take a chance on it; it's worth it. I'll be watching each of these actors and Alfonso Gomez-Rejon closely to see what they accomplish next.",

Even though the concept seems predictable and recycled, it doesn't make it not enjoyable. The directing and editing of this movie are some work of art, the pacing flows smoothly every bits of the frame is really enjoyable. It has great soundtrack despite they aren't used often and the timing is perfect. The acting is relatively great despite some minor characters. In the end, this is not a flick for you to watch if you are expecting some Oscar level piece or some life transcending movie experience. But if you want to just chill and feel some good vibe to waste your time alone or with some friends (I prefer alone) This one will definitely be a classic.",

I have seen many movies this year and by far this is one of the best combinations of comedy and drama into one movie. Just thought that should of shown more scenes with olivia cooke in it.

There's something so stunningly simply and simply stunning about this film that I can't put my finger on, just little details that have me laughing and crying, and sometimes- both at once! I think the main thing that captured me about this was the truthfulness to it. This film manages to portray the ugliness regarding terminal illness that some gloss over in a way that is light and fun but still serious enough to convey the tragedy of what is a reality for millions of people all over the world. There is so much truth in this film that it threatens to make the viewer explode. I was overcome with emotion and how very ordinary and extraordinary these characters were. The main three actors/actress were absolutely amazing! I especially loved the real awkwardness and nerdiness that comes with real-life teenagers (something that is often missed out to create ideal people). This film deals with so many things all at once, but it is never too overwhelming that you are left unable to process it- it's utterly perfect. It might take a while for you to get into it, unless you are wonderfully wacky! Greg is a weirdo. It's as simple as that. His humor is subjective and he tends to say the wrong things (like we all do at times). However, he is still lovable and caring and deeply invested in his friends. All I can say is if you liked this film, DON'T READ THE BOOK! I was bitterly disappointed with the book, especially as my expectations had been set high from the film. I finished it, but it dragged, despite the few scenes of brilliance. In the book, the characters are unfeeling and it is very difficult to care for them. In the film, you fall in love with them all for so many different reasons. Just watch it. It's beautiful.",

This film is beautiful, it plays with stop motion, shaped frames, camera angles and drawing in a way that no other film has done in recent years. The handmade aesthetic of the film is perfect for the main character Greg as his mind sees the world through film. This is a movie for everyone, film fanatics will appreciate the many references and homages to past films and people looking for a teen, cancer romance will find this is the perfect story, feel good and heart breaking. This film is often compared to The Fault in Our Stars, for a good reason, the stories are very similar, however Me and Earl seems to be what TFIOS could have been. This film stands alone, an audience doesn't need to read the book to understand and fall in love/hate with the characters. The acting and direction is stunning, with the three leading teens stealing the show.

I really did enjoy the text. In fact, its rare for me to be writting about a film in which I read the book first. I am movie of a movie person, always have been. I don't really feel like you would be writing on here (or reading for that matter) if you weren't. But what do I know.For what I would give about 90%, the film was accurate to the text. And I give my applause to them, because while the book was funny and well timed, it can be hard to recite tine from a book in a film without it feeling incredibly cheesy. Many things just sound better in your head- its a fact. But Thomas Mann had the perfect amount of whit and sarcasm to pull it off. As someone who many have just watched the film, I was convinced that this was the perfect person to comfort a dying girl. Well done.What put the film over the edge of the book would be the ending. Having Rachel die while watching the film, then more or less cutting to the visitation at her house was so beautiful in comparison to the crude ending of the novel where the film os showed to the entire school and Greg and Earl are left feeling completely rejected. I suppose the books can get away with this type of reality in there work, as they are much more complicated and have many more aspects in which to appreciate and notice. This movie was shooting for a good time- as all are, and needed a more sweet ending. They nailed it. Although there is a heart gripping moment that Greg has with his mom that I wished I could have seen, I understand how that may clash with the overall tone of the film. It is, after all, the most lighthearted take of one of most heavy situations. For this instance, I enjoyed what I watched more so than what I read, and that is the truth.I rally hated writing that because I find those comparisons rather annoying, but I also felt like it was worth being said. As an appreciation of the film itself, the style of editing was a great reflection of the style in which Greg and Earl made films themselves. Completely genius. Also stunned on how the soundtrack could seem so fitting for the theme without being overly powerful or overly know. Many film of this sort do try to use smaller artist and many times just miss the mark. Or they may just a song too well know, it which I call them a try hard.I do recommend this film.

However, on this occasion it was taken completely out of my hands due to Odeon Screen Unseen. First time I've been to a screen unseen and I can honestly say when the name of the film came up as we were sat in the cinema I was disappointed that it wasn't one of the bigger upcoming films such as Legend or Black Mass. Nonetheless, I'd already agreed with my Girlfriend that no matter what it turned out to be we would both stick through it and I'm so glad we did. Its an unusual film that never gets boring and whilst it can be quite depressing in parts it also has some very awkward sections leading to some brilliantly comical moments. I thought the casting was great with some unexpected Actors filling the supporting roles perfectly, namely; John Bernthal, Nick Offerman and Connie Britton.The way the film takes you through such a set of emotions from happy and joyous to sad, frustrated and angry is fantastic and has truly opened my eyes to a different genre of film I would never have thought to visit beforehand.Finally I'll say a big thumbs up to Odeon for their Screen Unseen and can only hope the next invite brings as good a film with it.",

This movie was hands down the most beautifully developed and heart-wrenchingly performed movie I've ever seen. It really made me realize that there are still good people, and people who appreciate good people, out there. Though it's a movie, movies like this can only be based on real life experiences that really rip your heart apart. Greg is so quirky and awkward, but in a rare and hilarious way, and Earl just adds to the hilarity. His pure genuineness, kindness, and 'over-the-top humility,' as Rachel put it, come packaged in that awkward casing; deep down you knew those former qualities were always there, but they truly emerge and blossom as you see him give of himself to Rachel day in and day out. He almost sacrificed his senior year and future for her. That is true friendship and love at its finest.Though Greg started spiraling (understandably) when he found out Rachel was stopping treatment, he showed his true colors when he brought the corsage to the hospital to give to his date. My heart was very satisfied when I heard that ambulance as he got out of the limo. He proved to be a real gentleman and good person, which are rare commodities nowadays. I think the beauty of the movie truly hit me at the end of the movie when they revealed quirky and artistic things about Rachel even after her death. (On a side note, I knew that I couldn't believe Greg when he said she wouldn't die That was the only thing he said in that movie that didn't sound genuine.) As Greg walked through the room, perusing her shelves of concave book art, and as I watched him trace the squirrel's path from wall tree to wall tree, hearing him describe the story behind her ashes being thrown in the park behind her house, I couldn't help but fall in love with her character and the movie as a whole. The ending was frustrating and painful and deeply heart-wrenching, but piercingly beautiful. I would watch this 1,000 times more. I don't know if I even want to watch another movie like it because I'll always have this profound, magnificent.movie to compare it to. I am deeply wonderfully satisfied.",

I still agree it is good movie. I would happily watch it again. Today i saw this on IMDb and decided to watch it. WOW. I am so happy i did. I am not ashamed to say i cried like a baby 2 or 3 times.

You are not thinking 'that's good acting ' of how brilliant the cinematography is you simply become part of the film. This is one of those films This film is just brilliant. It's a love story but it's not in the 'note book ' genre. To me it's about how two people who have lost their way for different reasons can fall completely in love with the other person and in doing so find their own way and grow. It so lulls you into believing there is going to be a truly happy ending and then just punches you in the gut but then somehow squeezes an uplifting hope at the end The actors are great but Olivia Cooke gives an utterly brilliant performance as a young girl trying to come to terms with a terminal illness with a fragility that just draws you into her fears and somewhat acceptance of what faces her I laughed. I cried I was devistated. But I walked out of the cinema and loved every second with a smile",

            "content": "Yeah, that was what I initially thought when considering going to the movie. It is a topic that makes it to the big screen far too often. Heck, we even had \"the Fault in our Stars\" so, so recently.Thankfully, I did decide to go and see it. Must have been something in the poster. It did look different. And so did the movie. First, it was really shot masterfully. I have never imagined that a typical high-school could be seen from such angles. The way we are presented with the home of the \"Dying Girl\" actually reflects the way the protagonist sees it. At some point of the movie, it turns out he has missed so much. And we had, too, because the director and cinematographer had done such a great job.The plot was really well played out. You are constantly forced into the skin of the protagonist to the point where you take everything he says for granted and you do feel what he's feeling. And he is both a typical and a very different kid. He's both mature (especially in areas such as cynicism and in taking care to look calmer than he actually is) and really, really immature (in issues relating to girls, of course, parents, his future, etc.)A note: the film is not about poking fun at anyone's suffering. It does touch on the topic of accepting things with a smile and moving on, but without forgetting. My only actual criticism of the movie relates to the very ending, hence this SPOILER ALERT! I really loved the scene where Greg explored Rachel's room and saw what he had missed to see so many times before. Th squirrels, the scissors, the things she did with the books. It was beautiful and really emotional. That is when he must have finally come to understood his wacky teacher's words about how you continue to learn things from and about the people you've lost even after they are already gone. It is a great message, but why did he have to spell it out in the next scene? We perfectly got it from the scene in Rachel's room and having it spelled out just about ruined the effect of that particular scene. I understand that the target audience might not understand it otherwise, but subtlety is the best approach to movie endings.Nevertheless, the movie was beyond great. I've marked the cinematographer and the director and hope to see their next projects soon.",

With a mix of a quirky indie feel, of having me cry out with laughter even though I was alone because of subtle well-timed awful jokes, and of its unforced and undramatic way of inducing sadness it managed to entertain and enthral from beginning to end. The main characters are fun and credible albeit the exaggerated minor characters such as the badass history teacher, alcoholic mom, social science professor dad, and all of the classic high-school stereotypes. Part of what I enjoyed the most was the little bits of movies that Greg and Earl had made, which are both visually engaging and provides something of a commentary to the actual movie progression. Couldn't give 'Me Earl and the Dying Girl' a warmer recommendation! Enjoy!",

            "content": "Me And Earl And The Dying Girl , is a movie based on a novel with the same name by Jesse Andrews and directed by Alfonso Gomez-Rejon and the actors are Thomas Mann(Greg , or the main guy) , RJ Cyler as Earl and Olivia Cooke as Rachel (or the dying girl) , the main plot is about a guy who is generally awkward , not belonging to any groups or gangs , self hating and abnormally separated(well at least it's not abnormal in my perspective ) , Greg has only one thing in his life , pass time and make lame movies with earl who he refuses to call a friend , and one day all of a sudden his mom tells him that Rachels mom called and said she is diagnosed with cancer, Greg early that day heard Rachel with her friends talking about a test and he thinking it's a school test tries to be funny which as usual is not, so Greg who has no idea why he gets involved in this story is forced by both his mom and his guilt for throwing words without actually knowing the story behind it has to hangout , he actually forces Rachel to hangout with him cause he knows his mom will always remind him of her and therefore he will remember his lame joke about the test , so with time Rachel gets worse and worse and Greg later does the hanging out kind of not because the previous reasons anymore but more because he gets in a kind of emotion with her , another side of the story is that hot girl in school who Greg thinks she is trying to use her hotness to make him do things she wants, not understanding she does all that so that she make Greg notice her .now I'm being like Greg talking too much awkwardly without saying the main thing which is :5 Reasons why I liked the movie so bad ,1-the movie showed how Greg pretended to like the separate life and somehow everyone thought he actually does which he doesn't , he tries so hard to be a funny and liked guy but who cares? and in the end giving up was all what is left to him , so he wants to give up until Rachel happen which actually makes him see how he is not a useless human if he tries even though he fails in the starting but later people start to communicate2- cancer , yes cancer stories are always touching , imagine if 50/50 was about ALS instead of cancer , wouldn't have been that touching , but no in this one you get another side of cancer , cancer more likely from the perspective of the close people of the victim , neither from the one with cancer nor from the people who are far enough not to care , it doesn't tell you how she was feeling it only shows it to you through the story . 3-she, simply giving up.. well no she doesn't simply give up she does take treatment in the first place but yeah when it doesn't work she does give up , that makes you understand what it must be like to see the way ahead of you getting narrower and narrower till it become closed and you either have to stop or bump into a wall so one may say the wall might be fake and i will bump into it but others may say well that's a freaking wall i will stop and wait to see what happens , and that's what she decides , i saw quite a bravery , it's not easy to decide to die over to try to live .4- Greg not going to prom, even though in the ending the hot girl from school does ask Greg to go with her to prom , but he doesn't , because it's simply too little too late , Greg finally gets to be brave enough to shout all what he has been in mind all the time , finally telling his mom to leave him alone even if for a while , finally telling rejecting to do whatever the hot girl says only because she is hot, those kinda shouting are not that easy to do , sometimes it needs quite a ball to do , but sometimes all you need is a push , a thing that reminds you life is not long enough to be that stupid and spend it the way others tell you to , and the push for Greg was Rachels decision to die , yes death the most remarkable push one can get , for me it wasn't a death that reminded of how life is short it was me failing one of my goals and later regretting to fail, yes just like Greg how he wanted to be alone and regret things i sat down for a long while and regret lots of things , but in the ending one shall restart. 5-why did Rachel want to be a squirrel , well it made it quite simple why she picked a tree wallpaper for her room , but why a squirrel , well at least as i saw no matter how life gets modern and develops and whatever , humans will never get over their life before any kind of development , and Rachel picks a squirrel because it's an animal with a fast movement and can do high jumps from a tree to another , can find food in weird places and the possibilities of being killed by larger animals is always 50/50 \u0085 what a wonderful adventure it is not to know if you will be dead a moment later or not",

It's a movie featuring young people that doesn't use violence as a plot element. The story carries itself along by exploring the invisible, social barriers in life, such as what to say or who can be talked to - all revolving around the central plot line of Rachel's illness. So the actors did a reasonable job of conveying this anxiety and frustration - I think the leading pair of the story was really the interaction between Greg and Rachel, rather than Earl - which leads me to my main point, which is the storyline can seem somewhat unstructured. Something about the storytelling process in the movie was lacking to me, which was unfortunate because the characters were quite interesting and I felt they could have been explored in greater depth. A good movie for its integration of mature subject matter into a high school movie, for its individual scenes which are richly detailed and visually pleasing, for its attempt to be an all-encompassing perspective of the high school experience. I appreciated the world that was envisioned, but my frustration was with the narration and Greg's own limited views, who perhaps says it best himself: \"I have no idea how to tell this story.\" In this film, the classic hero is absent and an annoying hero takes his place, which may very well be the writers' intentions.",

The title actually describes and sums up the plot well, although it is an incredibly vague synopsis. So to go into more detail, the story follows three high-school students in their final year of school, or for one, perhaps life. The late-teens include: the protagonist Greg Gaines, who narrates the movie in a deadpan Demetri Martin- esque tone; Earl Jackson, who's seen by his best friend Greg as a mere co-worker; and Rachel Kushner, the dying girl. The start of Greg and Rachel's platonic friendship is only initiated purely because of the demands of Greg's mum, so of course teenage awkwardness and hilarity ensues. On the side of hanging out with Rachel, amateur filmmakers Greg and Earl dedicate a lot of their time and effort deliberately making terrible parodies of classic movies purely because for them, it's hilarious. When Greg is asked to make a movie by a very pretty classmate for their number 1 fan Rachel, he takes on the daunting challenge purely because, as Earl would describe \"titties\". As creating the movie for Rachel comes along with the arbitrary dooming deadline, it takes a toll on Greg and Earl's friendship as they both try to create a movie for once that isn't just for shits and giggles. The aforementioned characters are easy-to-love/hard-to-hate and thus, easy-to-get- attached-to; especially Rachel, which is a bummer considering her \"dying\" description from the title. While the book falls under the genre of young adult fiction, the film appeals to an audience of an age equal to or more than a young adult. Despite the exploration of mature concepts e.g. the emotional turmoil of undergoing treatment of what-could- be a terminal illness, it is well balanced with witty humor throughout, so the audience isn't constantly distraught (which is generally what happens when watching any movie that involves one of the main characters being diagnosed with leukemia). Albeit, if anything, there are more laughs than there are tears in this movie. The only issue with the movie is the dialogue delivery. Due to the Gilmore girls style of speedy banter, it's hard to catch everything single word being said. If you are like me and lack super sonar hearing, to refrain from repeatedly asking the person next to you \"what did they just say?\" subtitles may be necessary or alternatively get as close to the speakers as possible.Provided that you haven't read the novel, the movie is unpredictable and comes with a killer soundtrack. Fans of Juno or 500 days of summer should find this movie just as appealing, as the same creators helped out in MAEATDG as well.",

            "content": "My problem with the teen comedy genre has always been the way it patronizes it's audience. Every joke is random and over top, or in English 'Lazy', Every emotion is taken to level 20 stupid by a sound track and cinematography that's afraid for it's audience will stop watching if they don't understand every single micro-detail and writing that may as well be improv for the number of sentimental puke fests. Today characters say too much to make up for their inability to act and express emotion through non verbal communication What a relieve that this film had none of that. The visual gags in this movie are on par with some of the best episodes of 'Spaced'. Rather than two slack jawed idiots screaming at each other in a still shot the camera does most of the talking constantly subverting the audience's expectation of sentimental cancer fueled smooching ( that's not a spoiler by the way.) It feels like we are watching one of Grant's (the main character) movies, a quick paced, slightly surreal parody on 'The Fault in our Stars.'Of course the cinematography would be nothing without the sharp writing, and superb acting. The lengthy monologues from various characters really stand out next to the awkward mumbling protagonist. There is a cogency in the writing not seen enough in cinema today where the character arks feel natural and satisfying never stooping to a cheap rant or emotional break down to tell the audience \"this guy's sad now\" or 'this is the climax of the movie now'. The film never says more than it needs to, with the actors using that non verbal communication I was talking about earlier, Whole scene go by without a word spoken but these are by far the funniest or most emotional parts of the film. The ideal archetype of a romantic comedy and the tragic futile reality are constantly being juxtaposed, making a profound statement on the way cinema makes us view the world with the extremes of imagination always withering before a stale reality, the curse of the auteur if you will is that his every thought has become a clich\u00e9 played to death by the culture of the time... don't know where I was going with that. Anyway this film goes from funny to tragic and every where in between. Since we believe in the surreal characters and the people in our own lives they are mocking you'll find yourself laughing hysterically at a character who could almost be your friend in a bad rappers outfit to the verge of tears and never be able to pin point where it changed. There isn't much more I can say without spoiling but I would highly recommend this movie it shows a huge step up for director Alfonso Gomez-Rejon (also known for GLEE) and is to me a cult classic in the making",

Me and Earl and the Dying Girl, directed by Alfonso Gomez-Rejon and screenplay done by Jesse Andrews, is based around these rigid social boundaries. This hit won the Sundance Feature Film Award, and was inspired by the award winning novel that is said to be \"the funniest book you will read about death.\" Based on two teenage boys who watch and create movies, this film is full of laughs, heart wrenching scenes, and many awkward moments. Greg (Thomas Mann) and Earl (RJ Cyler) are seniors at Pittsburgh's Schenley High School. Greg is so naive that he refers to Earl as his \"co-worker\" instead of his best friend. To avoid joining any cliques, the two of them eat in their professor's office and watch movies that they have created. The movies are spoofs of classic movies such as \"The 400 Blow\" and \"The Wizard of Oz.\" Because of these movies they create, Greg later gets the task of making a movie for his dying classmate. Greg's life is changed when his parents (Nick Offerman and Connie Britton) insists he visits Rachel (Olivia Cooke) who was recently diagnosed with leukemia. Scared he will be judged, Greg doesn't allow himself to actually live life. As they spend more time together you see a change in Greg. Rachel devotes all of her time as she is dying towards Greg. She inspires him, teaches him how to live, and love, but most importantly, she gives him a reason to live. Thomas Mann is the perfect actor to fill Greg's role. Being a tall, lanky kid, he has that natural look of being to himself and avoiding all social contact. The way he holds himself as an actor really brings out his character. There are times Mann has to be very serious when he is with Rachel, and then he has to quickly become someone who is funny and awkward. He did a great job in this film transitioning from one personality to the other.Brian Eno and Nico Muhly created the soundtrack for the majority of this movie. The songs are simple and some are very classical. \"The Big Ship\" is a song played in the short film Greg makes for Rachel while she is in the hospital. This song, in particular gives you a sense of comfort and security, exactly what Greg is trying to provide for Rachel. The songs fulfill the mood of each scene perfectly.The importance of friendship through death is shown immensely through this movie. A lot like The Fault in Our Stars, the impact two people can have on one another during hard times can change everything. You see this same interaction between Shailene Woodley and Ansel Elgort in the drama filled movie, The Fault in our Stars. The bond Greg and Rachel have inspires and changes him in ways Greg never thought was possible. One of the best parts of the movie is when the producer shows clips of Greg and Earl's short movies. It is clear that he had fun making this part of the movie. It adds humor and laughs to such a heart wrenching movie about death. Me and Earl and the Dying Girl is a very touching movie with many tears shed, but it also has a lot of life lessons in it. For instance, you never know who will have an impact on your life, and don't automatically assume something before you get a chance to experience it. That one moment, person, or idea could change your life for the better and change it for the rest of your life.",

But alas, Me and Earl and the Dying Girl is a true testament to the power of YA pop culture, and a young adult film infused with the current obsession with cancer-driven teen fiction.\r Following in the footsteps of the widely popular The Fault in Our Stars and my personal favourite cancer-comedy 50/50, Me and Earl and the Dying Girl is a mix of both, with a hint of 500 Days of Summer in for good indie measure.\r Thankfully, Me and Earl and the Dying Girl is miles ahead of the aforementioned Stars and is easily one of the most wryly self-aware and raucously comedic films of the year.\r The ironic aspect of Me and Earl is that cancer has never really been at the front-row of comedy in the real world. Although it is one of the most devastating diseases of our time, consuming the lives of many loved ones, cancer, in this instance, sets up one of the most endearing and authentic cinematic friendships seen on screen, in a very long time.\r Now if you are all thinking, how in the hell is a film about a very pending friendship between two boys and a girl recently diagnosed with leukaemia one of the funniest and best films of the year? All I\u2019d have to say is \u201cRespect the Research\u201d and find out for yourself.\r THIS IS THE PART WHERE I EXPLAIN MY COMMENTARIES ON THE FILM\r One of the many (and I\u2019m talking about a ton) charms of Me and Earl is its ability to share so many universal and relatable truths to its audience. The fact remains, Rachel Kushner (Olivia Cooke) is a seventeen-year old girl who is recently diagnosed with Leukaemia. Greg Gaines (Thomas Mann) is a smart-talking, quick responding, social leper who has serious issues with the word friendship and a great appreciation for hipster and event-garde culture (including Warhol, Herzog and B-films). Earl (RJ Cyler), the innocent by-stander in all of this, is your typical high-schooler who obsesses mostly with ****  Yet, these three unique characters and the serious and lighthearted issues they face in a small Pittsburg high school offer some of the most insightful and emotional responses from an audience in the year 2015.\r Based on Jesse Andrews\u2019 book of the same name, the author was able to adapt his own book into a screenplay, keeping its infectious charm and wit intact. Luckily for us, Andrews\u2019 book has been described as a book made to be read by anyone; anyone who has gone to high school, anyone who has lost someone they love, or grew up with a family, or has wondered what life is all about.\r Directed by Alfonso Gomez-Rejon, a sophomore feature following his debut horror film The Town That Dreaded Sundown, the film blends a very inauspicious mix of quirk at first by beginning the story with an abundance of stop-motion animation, flashbacks, and some very obvious film-school favourites including; the long take; pans; and long shots. Rejon, who began his career as a personal assistant to Martin Scorsese, shows his range as a charming director who is able to not only amp up the quirk factor, but also get the best performances from his actors and characters to help narrate the story to uncontrollable moments of laughter. Much like its main character Greg (Thomas Mann) and his inability to obtain normal friendships or accept the obvious classes created in any high school setting, Rejon embraces the main essence of Andrews\u2019 novel, loss and love and stays true to its unique nerdiness, owning every second of it.\r THIS IS THE PART WHERE I\u2026TALK\r It was the best of times, it was the worst of times, and for the most part, Me and Earl and the Dying Girl is easily one of the most satisfying films of 2015, and not for the usual ingredients that make an indie film so great either. While most indie films are applauded and hailed for their quirky soundtracks, incredible acting discoveries, and new finds, Me and Earl has an interesting quality of brining back the old, and making it cool again. Rejon, an obvious film enthusiast and lover of classics (Criterion quality to B-movie selections) sends great satisfaction of allowing his feature of reminiscing on these classic films in a fringe-type cinematic wet dream. His rehashing, mockery yet clear praise and reference to classic films shows his great admiration and love for film as a whole. While Greg and Earl half-heartedly remake some of their favourtite films, we get a clear sense of what makes them great friends, their ability to embrace their immaturity and playfulness. Rejon pulls it off through and through, that boys will be boys, while Mann and Cyler really hit that notion out of the par throughout each scene.",

I think it's interesting how He wrote Greg and Rachel as the realest characters in this movie and make others as these comical and not so serious supporting characters. I think it's important because this whole movie is supposed to tell how this dying girl can somehow change Greg's view in life.

(Hey, I am looking forward to \u201cMagic Mike XXL\u201d next week, what can I tell you?)\r In the case of \u201cEarl\u201d and \u201cDope\u201d I think there is definitely a very wide generation gap. The last time I saw my teens was 60 years ago and though I enjoyed \u201cThe Fault Is In Our Stars\u201d last year it was more of a drama than teenage angst. There is some humor in \u201cEarl\u201d regarding the movies that Earl (RJ Cyler) and Geg (the \u2018Me\u2019-- Thomas Mann) make redoing classics, especially the titles they give their films. Olivia Cooke is certainly endearing as \u2018the dying girl, Rachel, while Greg grows up over the course of the film and Earl is a wise young man before his time.\r Molly Shannon as Rachel\u2019s single mother and Connie Britton as Greg\u2019s mother, both overbearing parents, along with Nick Offerman as his beatnik father---by the way Earl doesn\u2019t have any parents and lives with his older brother who threatens Greg with telling him his dog will bite off his face--and Jon Bernthal as a teacher and, more or less, a guidance counselor to the boys, are sort of annoying adults you will find in most pictures about teenagers though the latter less than the others.\r \u201cEarl\u201d is being sold as a comedy, a sort of John Hughes movie with lessons to be learned. Greg is constantly reminding the audience--there is a lot of voice over-- that Rachel doesn\u2019t die and there are screen titles telling the passing of time and where we are at in the story. As a social misfit Thomas Mann carries the film and RJ Cyer is his effective sidekick and shows his many sides. Olivia Cooke is endearing as the dying girl who has leukemia and is very instrumental is helping Greg grow up.\r The direction by Alfonso Gomez-Rejon is all over the place, somewhat like the movies the boys make, while the screenplay by Jesse Andrews, who wrote the best selling novel, is low key without trying to tell the audience how to feel. The director of photography shows off Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, almost always in a glow of light, even in the night scenes.\r I laughed once and that was the boys film take-off of \u201cMidnight Cowboy\u201d  with the \u201cEverybody\u2019s Talking\u201d theme song and, for a comedy, laughing once is not a good endorsement.\r I left the theatre wondering whatever happened to the girl who got stood up on prom night--maybe that\u2019s the sequel?",

So this film, focusing on both, seems to be getting far more attention than I believe it deserves.  Honestly I don't see this being any better than 2002's A Night To Remember.\r That being said the short films (or at least what we as an audience get to see of them) are pretty cool, and honestly I'd have preferred if that took more of a centrepiece of the movie for the first half, and the characters developed more fluidly, as the actual script and characters is bland.",

Thomas Mann plays a high school senior, pressured by his mother to spend time with a classmate (Olivia Cooke) who has leukemia. He and his best friend (RJ Cyler) also make parodies of great films, a subplot that provides some witty cinema in-jokes (stay thru the credits for a complete list of titles). The film's eccentric humor is often clever and fun, although it sometimes try too hard. Once the story hits rocky ground, things quickly fall into emotional drama. Director Alfonso Gomez-Rejon has peppered the proceedings with witty angles (literally and figuratively) that add to the movie's oddball charms.",

The film is also a film nerds wet dream with so many references and mentions of classic films that the film itself is as much as an homage to classic films as the amateur films made by the characters. Though there are better coming of age dramedies out there, Me & Earl & the Dying Girl is certainly one of the better ones I have seen thanks to great acting, directing, writing, and a heartfelt story that feels so relatable it almost hurts.

This is a comedy, a quirky comedy but its very much a cringe-enducing form of comedy - a sort of dark comedy very much about social awkwardness, the pitfalls of being less than the all popular guy at the end of high school, i.e. secondary school. There isn't a laughter track or anything like that. It features narration, which is done very much in a blase, whatever, lets just explain this and then I'll move on and get out of your way, kind of a way. It has the feel of an indie cult classic, although I don't honestly remember when I first heard about it but I did enjoy it.Greg has an interesting hobby, which is making parodies of classic films with who he calls his co-worker Earl, rather than a friend. These are obviously done on a much, much lower budget and we're shown a number of covers for said films, which have quite funny word pun type titles, such as 'Rosemary Baby Carrots', 'Brew Velvet' and 'A Sockwork Orange'. I found the clips of said film parodies quite amusing and endearing to an extent - their made via puppet/stop motion animation styles, think papier mache props and the like.I felt sorry for Greg, as I can fairly easily remember what its like to feel like an awkward outsider at school, as he's clearly shown to be. It is quite a quirky film and it reminded me a bit of Napolean Dynamite, although the main character isn't as comic and doesn't stand out in the way that the titular character of that film did.Cast wise, Greg is played by Thomas Mann. He seems pretty much like a regular joe American mid teen. He comes across as relatively apathetic - I'm not sure how else I could describe him. Meanwhile, Earl is played by RJ Cyler, Olivia Cooke plays said dying girl Rachel and Molly Shannon plays Denise.I liked the way the film comes across, with numerous new scenes starting with text across the screen saying the name of that new scene, basically saying what Greg was thinking at that time, such as 'the time Rachel had just started treatment', 'the time I felt so awkward I just had to say something' (as if that only ever happens once, eh?). Content wise, the film features mild sex references and partial nudity. There are instances of mild violence but nothing gorey or graphic is shown as such. There is some swearing and drug reference are also made but otherwise there's little likely to offend people, although obviously the story and themes are pretty sobering and sad. The film has been given a 12 rating due to this.I think it says something about inevitability - its quite a sobering thought. Its definitely (inevitably) not a laugh out loud hilarious type of a film but I did find some parts amusing, although I accept it won't appeal to everyone. I wouldn't say its entirely a drama film, there is a fair amount of quirkiness present - its a bit hard to describe, other than a quirky indie comedy/drama film.Some of the music played was surprisingly distinctive.Tracks featured include In Dreams by Roy Orbison, Trouble by Cat Stevens and I'll Come Running by Brian Eno. Some well known classical pieces played include the Ride of the Valkyries and a few piano pieces which I have no idea what their called.I'd recommend this film, as I found it to be an amusing, quirky, somewhat thought provoking film, one which I imagine quite a few people could relate to. Its an interesting watch, so I'd recommend it on that basis.",
